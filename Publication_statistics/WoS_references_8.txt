The comprehensive understanding of combustion behavior of iron particles is crucial for studying fundamental mechanisms, developing suitable combustion technologies, and designing efficient iron powder combustor. In this work, iron particles are combusted in a modified Bunsen burner with a stable metal powder supplying system. As a versatile three-dimensional (3D) imaging technique, high-speed digital in-line holography (DIH) is employed to reconstruct the 3D particle field and simultaneously quantify the size, 3D location and velocity of burning iron particles. The statistical results of three cases with oxygen volume fraction varying from 24% to 40% are obtained and compared at different heights above the burner. Along the height, some typical features of the burning iron particles were observed. The violent combustion of iron particles accelerates the ejection of the particles radially outward from the central region of the flame, resulting in non-uniform spatial distribution of the particles and reducing the particle number density in the measurement volume. Such trend is enhanced with increased oxygen concentration. Besides, the observed particle size enlarged as the height increases, which validates the swelling phenomenon of iron particle oxidation. The results demonstrate that DIH is a powerful tool for in-situ, quantitative characterization of particle dynamics in flames. (c) 2021 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The changes in the carbon and metal core-level spectra and the chemical stoichiometries of polymer-metal interfaces with progressive deposition of the metal atoms were monitored. The interactions of the Al and In atoms with the polymer surfaces were compared. For both metals, a simple electrical contact was not formed. From the XPS studies, it was deduced that chemical reactions had occurred between the polymer and the metal, leading to the formation of an interfacial layer of metal oxides and complexes. The interfacial reactions were promoted by the surface oxidation states of the polymer, the migration of bulk adsorbed oxygen to the polymer surface upon metal deposition, and also in the case of MEH-PPV, by the oxygen from the alkoxy side chains.

Diurnal and seasonal soil CO2 flux patterns in spring maize fields on the Loess Plateau, China	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Maize cultivation practices; soil moisture content; soil temperature; temporal variability	CARBON-DIOXIDE EVOLUTION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; PLASTIC FILM; WATER CONTENT; RESPIRATION; TEMPERATURE; FOREST; TILLAGE; AGROECOSYSTEM; PRODUCTIVITY	Carbon dioxide flux from the soil to the atmosphere is an important component of terrestrial C cycling, and accurate estimates of CO2-C fluxes are crucial for estimating C budgets. A field study was conducted (i) to examine the diurnal and seasonal soil CO2 flux pattern in spring maize fields on the Loess Plateau, and (ii) to determine the effects of soil characteristics affected by various cultivation practices on CO2 flux from the soil surface to the atmosphere. Soil surface CO2 flux was determined with an LI-8100 Automated Soil Flux System, and related environmental factors were also measured, including near-ground air temperature and relative humidity, soil moisture (0-15 cm), soil temperature (at depths of 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm), and leaf area index. Diurnal soil CO2 flux showed a single peak between 12-00 h and 16-00 h, and reached a minimum in the early morning, at about 4-00 h. During the crop's growing season, soil CO2 flux increased during the rapid vegetative growth stages, reached its maximum during the peak reproductive stages, and then declined as the plants senesced. Time series analysis showed that the temporal dynamics of the CO2 flux were more closely related to air temperature than to soil temperature; this may be because a substantial portion of the CO2 originated from surface residues. The time-averaged mean soil CO2 flux for different cultivation practices over the growing season was ranked as follows: plastic film mulching (3.980 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) > corn straw mulching (3.464 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) > supplementary irrigating (3.157 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) > rain-fed (2.371 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) > bare ground (1.934 mmol m(-2) s(-1)). Different cultivation practices affected plant and microbial activities, and soil hydrothermal conditions, and caused different patterns of soil surface CO2 flux in spring maize fields on the Loess Plateau.

Their electrochemical performances have been evaluated, which indicate that the Li1.20Ti0.44Cr0.36O2/C exhibits much higher cyclic stability and capacity than the pristine one. The initial delithiation capacity of the Li1.20Ti0.44Cr0.36O2/C can reach 217.1 mAh g(-1). The reversible capacity retention is 94 % after 100 cycles at current density of 23 mA g(-1). Ex situ X-ray diffraction and electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy coupled with impedance fitting have been employed to reveal evolution of the crystal structure and the electrochemical kinetics of the Li1.20Ti0.44Cr0.36O2/C with delithiation/lithiation cycling. The results indicate that the cation layers of the Li1.20Ti0.44Cr0.36O2/C experience order to disorder transition. The abrupt delithiation capacity fading and potential drop after the initial cycle are resulted from the order to disorder transition accompanying with steep increase of the charge transfer resistance and decrease of the exchange current density and the Li-ion diffusion coefficient simultaneously.

The chemical state and composition of the metal/polymer interfaces were studied as a function of the potassium coverage. Potassium was found to interact extensively with the bulk-adsorbed oxygen to form a layer of metal oxide at the K/PFT interface. Migration of the bulk-adsorbed oxygen to the surface occurred in response to the deposition of potassium onto the polymer. The changes in the S 2p lineshape suggested the formation of a thiolate species at low potassium coverages and also a sulphide species at higher metal coverages. The presence of charge transfer from the deposited potassium atoms to the carbon atoms of PFT suggested that the polymer had undergone n-type doping. The deposited potassium atoms also diffused into the subsurface region of the polymer film. Thus, the interface of K/PFT contained mainly the oxidized metal, metallic potassium and metal-polymer charge transfer complexes. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Influence of temperature on the low-cycle fatigue properties of compacted graphite iron	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE			English	Article						Compacted graphite iron; Low-cycle fatigue; Temperature; Damage mechanism; Life prediction model	ENGINE CYLINDER BLOCKS; THERMOMECHANICAL FATIGUE; THERMAL FATIGUE; CAST-IRON; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CRACK INITIATION; TENSILE-STRENGTH; LIFE PREDICTION; RESISTANCE; MICROSTRUCTURE	Strain-controlled low-cycle fatigue (LCF) tests at a fairly high strain rate were performed on as-cast compacted graphite iron (CGI) controlled with total strain amplitude at 25, 400 and 500 degrees C. The results show that CGI has the longest fatigue life, smallest stable hysteresis loop area at 400 degrees C. The reason is that the effective bearing size of the ferrite increases from 25 degrees C to 400 degrees C because slip deformation is retarded by carbon atom diffusion and carbide formation, and decreases from 400 degrees C to 500 degrees C because of the appearance of the ferrite grain boundary sliding. That effect of temperature is associated with the elastic strain amplitude instead of the plastic strain or stress amplitudes in macroscope. Finally the corresponding improvement suggestions based on these were also proposed.	[Qiu, Y.; Pang, J. C.; Li, S. X.; Zhang, M. X.; Zhang, Z.

This study used novel chemical weathering indices and palynological data for Lower Cretaceous mudstone in the Laiyang Group coupled with existing geochemical data, day mineralogy and plant fossil record to reconstruct the geochemical weathering conditions and paleoclimatic evolution of the Jiaolai Basin over this period. Four distinctive episodes of paleoclimatic change were identified, with one linked to an extremely dry-hot climatic event correlated with the Oceanic Anoxia Event (OAE)1a. During Stage 1, strong chemical weathering was correlated with a relatively warm-humid climate during the early Aptian but the intensity of chemical weathering tended to decrease with an increasingly dry and hot climate. In contrast, Stage 2 was characterised by stable conditions with weak chemical weathering and an extremely dry, hot climate during the early and middle Aptian. The presence of organic-rich black shale and the associated distribution of organic carbon isotope values verified that the extremely dry-hot climate during this stage was related to OAE 1a. Stage 3 was a transitional period extending through the middle and late Aptian during which the climate became relatively warm and humid, triggering increases in chemical weathering. Finally, Stage 4 during the late Aptian was characterised by a return to high chemical weathering rates and a warmer climate. Notably, the paleoclimatic changes in the Aptian period indicated by the geochemical record of the Jiaolai Basin are synchronous with those indicated by marine records. The results of this study provide a reference for further study of this climatic event in terrestrial systems within the context of the greenhouse climate in the Cretaceous.	[Zhang, X. Y.; Wang, W.

The columns were 200 mm square cross section with lengths ranging from 1600 to 3000 mm. Ten columns were tested under axial load. The effects of the strengthening technique, slenderness ratio, cross-section area of steel angle and CFRP layer number were examined in terms of axial load-axial strain curve, CFRP strain, steel strip strain and steel angle strain. The experiments indicate that strengthening RC columns with combined CFRP and steel jacket is effective in enhancing the load capacity, ductility and energy dissipation capacity of RC column. Based on the existing models for RC columns strengthened with CFRP and with steel jacket, a design formula considering a slenderness reduction factor is proposed to predict the load capacity of the RC columns strengthened with combined CFRP and steel jacket. The predictions agree well with the experimental results.

In this study, high concentrations of fine particulate matter (107.6 +/- 25.3 mu g/m(3)) were measured in haze episodes. The most abundant chemical components were organic matter (OM), SO42-, NO3-, elemental carbon (EC), and NH4+, which varied significantly on haze and non-haze days. The concentrations of OM and EC were 38.5 +/- 5.4 mu g/m(3) and 12.3 +/- 2.1 mu g/m(3) on haze days, which were more than four times greater than those on non-haze days. Source apportionment using a chemical mass balance (CMB) model showed that the dominant sources were secondary sulfate (17.7%), secondary organic aerosols (17.1%), and secondary nitrate (14.2%) during the entire sampling period. The source contribution estimates (SCEs) of most sources at clean sites were lower than at urban and industrial sites. Prima ry industrial emission sources, such as coal combustion and steel smelting, made larger contributions at industrial sites, while vehicle exhausts and cooking smoke showed higher contributions at urban sites. In addition, the SCEs of secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols on haze days were much higher than those on non-haze days, indicating that the secondary particulate matter formations process was the dominating reason for high concentrations of particles on haze days.

Organic Rankine cycle coupled with biomass combustion boiler is an appealing and promising technology for small-scale combined heat and power systems. In this paper, a biomass-fired ORC-CHP system integrated with monoethanolamine-based CO2 capture is designed, in which the pressurized hot water is used as heat source for ORC system and the condensation heat can be fully utilized to supply domestic hot water. The pinch point temperature difference analytic method is adopted to investigate thermodynamic performance. Thermodynamic analysis, parametric optimization and economic assessment with a special focus on CO2 capture have been conducted for eleven candidate working fluids. Results show that an optimal evaporation temperature exists with a given pressure ratio in the ORC system. The optimal heat source temperature for ORC system in the bioenergy system can be obtained by optimizing the total investment, dynamic payback period and profit ratio of investment, and the condensation temperature is also optimized using a thermo-economic evaluation. The biomass-fired ORC-CHP system with cyclopentane presents excellent thermodynamic performance with the highest primary energy saving ratio, the lowest net power indicator and levelized energy cost, followed by R141b, R113, R123 and Pentane; while HFE7000 achieving the largest profit ratio of investment and net present value is the best preferable working fluid in terms of economic assessment, followed by R1233zd, isobutane, isopentane and R113. The bioenergy system with optimized parameters is thermodynamically feasible and economically attractive, eco-friendly with negative carbon dioxide emissions thanks to the CO2 capture.

Current research mainly focuses on either organic or inorganic soil amendments, whereas few studies address options of combining organic and inorganic amendments. The objective of this study was to develop new organic and inorganic soil amendments which can lower the soil pH, replace sodium, and improve soil structure. Materials and methods Polyhalite (PL), microporous potassium-silicon-calcium mineral fertilizer (MF), furfural residue (FR), and fulvic acid (FA) were mixed with four different ratios to produce organic and inorganic soil amendments: PLFR, PLFA, MFFR, and MFFA. And their optimum mixing ratios were determined by comparing the potassium, calcium concentrations, and pH of filtrate after dissolution. Then, a leaching experiment was conducted by packing mixtures (mass ratio of soil to amendment = 219:1, equivalent to 13 t/hm(2)) of the saline-sodic soil with each one of these amendments plus two contrasts, gypsum (GP), and no amendment (CK). And the remediation effect was compared by pH, EC, ESP, texture, organic recombination degree of clay, saturated hydraulic conductivity, water-stable aggregates fraction, and enzyme (urease, alkaline phosphatase, and catalase) activities of soil. Results and discussion After four times leaching experiment, soil treated with PLFR had lower pH and 25.86% lower exchangeable sodium than untreated soils. The water-stable small macroaggregate fractions and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the MFFR-treated soils were significantly increased by 133% and 31%, respectively. Also, the total soil and heavy fraction organic carbons of the soils treated with MFFR in addition to its alkaline phosphatase activity were all significantly higher than the other treatments. Conclusions The results revealed that MFFR has more potential as a soil amendment to improve soil structure and quality and thus help in the development and use of saline-sodic lands for agriculture.

Transcriptome, Biochemical and Growth Responses of the Marine Phytoplankter Phaeodactylum Tricornutum Bohlin (Bacillariophyta) to Copepod Grazer Presence	CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Essential nutrient content; Grazing stress; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; Marine phytoplankton; RNA sequencing; Transcriptome	FATTY-ACID-COMPOSITION; CHEMICAL DEFENSE; NITRIC-OXIDE; CELL-CYCLE; CALANUS-PACIFICUS; ACARTIA-HUDSONICA; FOOD QUALITY; MITOTIC EXIT; DIATOMS; PHOSPHATASE	Background/Aims: As a model organism for a pleiomorphic marine planktonic primary producer, Phaeodactylum tricornutum has been studied on a molecular level under diverse cultural conditions. But little is known about its morphological, nutritional or transcriptomic responses under grazing stress. Methods: To assess microalgal molecular and cellular responses to grazer presence, we conducted transcriptome profiling in combination with growth rate, biovolume, fatty acid content, carbon and nitrogen content measurements in the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. RNA-sequencing was used to evaluate the transcriptomic response to grazing stress for P. tricornutum strain CCAP 1055/1. Results: Among the differentially expressed genes, we found down-regulation of genes involved in pathogen resistance, and in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, while mitosis-involved genes were up-regulated. Experimentally testing morphological and biochemical responses in five strains of the species, we detected strain-specific significant effects of simulated grazing pressure in altered growth rates, biovolume and nutritional composition. Conclusion: Our research reveals the associated molecular and cellular responses to grazing effects in P. tricornutum and extends the understanding of co-evolutionary roles in regulating grazing defence between P. tricornutum and its grazer.

When only 7 wt% PDTD was added, limited oxygen index (LOI) of EP-7% composite greatly elevated to 36% from 22.5% of neat EP with a 60% of increment, and obtained a UL-94 V0 rating as well as showed good heat and smoke suppression properties. The results of flame retardant index (FRI) showed EP-7% was considered to have good flame retardance. The cure of epoxy/PDTD was qualitatively analyzed by cure index (CI), and the result exhibited EP/PDTD system (EP-3%, EP-5%) possessed excellent cure state at low concentration of PDTD. In addition, investigation of flame-retardant mechanism revealed that the improvement of flame retardancy was mainly due to the barrier effect of residual carbon in condensed phase, and dilution effect and free radical capture effect of gaseous phase.

The composition of the medium for the production of welan gum was optimized with a stepwise strategy. Effects of various carbon and nitrogen sources were investigated. Plackett-Burman design was applied to elucidate the key ingredients in the media and the results indicated that the corn starch, cottonseed cake flour have significant effects on welan gum production. Central composite design was employed to search for the optimal concentration of the two key components and the experimental results were fitted to a second-order polynomial model at a 98% level of significance. By solving the regression equation and also by analyzing the response surface contour plots, the relative high welan gum production (22.85 g l(-1)) was obtained at the optimal medium combinations and fermentation conditions as corn starch 43.6 g l(-1), cottonseed cake flour 4.1 g l(-1), 16-h-old inoculum of 3% ( v v(-1)) sizes, initial pH 7.0 and temperature 30 degrees C. These predicted values were also verified by validation experiments.

In recent decades, land reclamation flourished in the Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL) to supplement cultivated lands (CLs) occupied by urbanization. To analyze the effects of land reclamation on wind erosion, the soil texture and soil nutrients in arable and uncultivated lands should be evaluated. In this study, we collected 54 paired soil samples from CLs and nearby uncultivated lands (NULs) in the MUSL considering land use data pertaining to different phases. Then, the soil particle distribution (PSD) and contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were measured in the laboratory. The results indicated that after 1-15 years (Yr) of cultivation, compared to the NULs, particles ranging from 60 to 400 mu m obviously decreased. With increasing number of cultivation years, the wind sorting effects accumulated, and the content of erodible particles susceptible to wind erosion decreased. Among the CLs with different cultivation years, new CLs exhibited the highest erodible particle content, and medium CLs exhibited the lowest erodible particle fraction content. The SOC contents in the medium and fine sand groups among the new CLs was significantly influenced by wind erosion, whereas the TN content was primarily controlled by nitrogenous fertilizer application. After cultivation for longer than 40 years, the total SOC and TN contents in the CLs were significantly higher than those in the NULs. Among the CLs, the wind sorting effects and number of cultivation years obviously influenced the SOC content, whereas the TN content in the CLs was mainly influenced by nitrogenous fertilizer utilization. Rapid urbanization of Shaanxi Province, a new round of national ecological policy adjustments and altered wind environments are the main reasons for the development of new CLs, and a superior location and soil physicochemical properties contribute to the occurrence of old CLs. Based on the above analysis, we propose that conservative cultivation is the key to the protection of new CLs from wind erosion hazards.

Generally low carbon steel was used to substrates, using stainless was reported less. In this paper, Electroless plating Ni-W-P coatings were directly obtained using the compound complexing agent. Microstructure evolution and properties, especially adhesion strength and wear resistance, of the coating were investigated. The conclusions are drawn as follows: a bright, homogeneous and fine Ni-W-P coating was obtained; after heat-treatment at 400 degrees C, its hardness HK can increase to 11850 MPa from 8186 MPa. The diffusion layer, formed during heat treatment, made the mechanical occlusion transform into metallurgical occlusion, which increased the binding force between the coating and the substrate. The wear resistance of the coating was also improved after annealing.

Compared to the parental strain, mutant strain FM19 exhibited an increase in titer and yield of 56.3% and 36.6%, respectively, corresponding to a titer of 49.4 g/L and a yield of 0.56 g fumaric acid per g glucose. Metabolic profiling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that higher levels of carbon (Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and tricarboxylic acid cycle) and amino acid metabolism were operating in the high-yielding strain: particularly, 4-aminobutyric acid and 5-aminolevulinic acid were increased 10.33- and 7.22-fold, respectively, compared with parental strain during stationary phase. These findings provided new insights into metabolic characterization of high-yielding fumaric acid R. oryzae. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper analyzes the energy saving mechanism and carbon reduction laws of decarbonized polygeneration systems, and discusses the compatibility of CO2 capture for different integral schemes. Based on the novel method of chemical exergy balance, two typical methanol-power polygeneration systems with CO2 recovery are analyzed in detail, and integral factors that indicate the level of energy cascade utilization and the compatibility with CO2 capture are proposed. Both polygeneration systems show large performance improvements compared to the single production systems, but the advantages of scheme (b), removing the composition adjustment and capturing CO2 from unrecycled gas after synthesis, are more prominent. This scheme has an excellent compatibility with CO2 recovery, and it shows a fairly optimal performance in the full working field. Further, according to the analysis of the integral factors, a higher CO2 recovery ratio is recommended for scheme (b), while a lower one is recommended when scheme (a) is employed.

After 27-d operation, 71.3% of V(V) and 91.2% of Cr(VI) were removed respectively, with citrate as organic carbon source. Enhancement of Cr(VI) bioreduction was observed with the suppressed V(V) reduction. V(IV) and Cr(III), the main reduction products, precipitated inside the organisms and attached on cell surfaces. Both membrane components containing cytochrome c and cytoplasmic fractions containing soluble proteins as well as NADH may contribute to these microbial reductions. Most Cr(VI) were reduced extracellularly and V (V) tended to be reduced through intracellular process, as revealed by mapping the microbial surface and a line scan across the cell, performed by scanning transmission electron microscopy.

Revegetation significantly increased the bacterial-fungal interactions in different successional stages of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	CATENA			English	Article						Revegetation; Microbes; Diversity; Composition; Interactions; Keystone species	SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; PLANT DIVERSITY; LOESS PLATEAU; CARBON; RESTORATION; QUALITY; MEADOWS; NETWORK; TIME; ESTABLISHMENT	Numerous restoration measures have been implemented to rebuild degraded alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, one of the most fragile regions in the world. Understanding the responses of soil microbes to restoration activities is critical to predict restoration direction and trajectories, as soil microbes play a key role in ecosystem functioning and nutrients cycling. In this study, we identified the effects of revegetation on soil microbial community composition and diversity, and the interaction between bacterial and fungal taxa in different successional stages (early stage, middle stage, late stage) by using a severely degraded grassland as the baseline, and healthy grassland as the target. Our results show that the composition of bacteria at phylum level and fungi at class level were significantly changed between successional stages. The diversity of bacteria at OTU level was significantly decreased, while the diversity of fungal OTUs were not significantly changed with successional stages. Plant and soil properties explained 53.15% variation of bacterial structure and 46.16% variation of fungal structure. Plant community, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and soil pH mainly influence microbial community during recovery process. Bacterial and fungal groups would become more similar to that of the healthy grassland along successional stages, because of the shift in soil resources and plant community. Total links and negative links of bacteria-fungi interaction networks increased along successional stages of revegetated grasslands. Keystone species in each network also changed with successional stages. These findings verified that revegetation could be effective to restore the microbial community of severely degraded grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

Structural analysis for the design of a lightweight composite railway axle	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Railway axle; Lightweighting; Unsprung mass; Composite material; NEXTGEAR; Structural analysis		The unsprung masses associated with the axles of a railway vehicle result in costly impact damage to the rail infrastructure. A hybrid metallic-composite (HMC) railway axle is evaluated using finite element analysis. The axle mass is 74 kg, 63% lighter than an equivalent hollow steel axle. The HMC railway axle comprises a full length, carbon fibre reinforced, epoxy matrix composite tube with secondary overwrapping for stiffness and EA1N grade steel collars creating the wheel seats and journal surfaces. Maximum axle deflection is 1.72 mm with a misalignment at the journals of 0.21 degrees, potentially requiring a bearing reassessment. Nominal bending stress in the axle is 99.3 MPa (Tsai-Wu damage index of 0.18). Peak bending and torsional stresses result in Tsai-Wu damage indexes of 0.71 and 0.42, respectively. The methodology in this paper can be extended to the design of future lightweight composite shafts to benefit many other industries.	[Johnson, M. S.; Evans, R.; Mistry, P.

However, in practical applications, the problem of low miscibility of CO2 and crude oil, resulting in low oil displacement efficiency, cannot be avoided. Thus, finding an appropriate method to increase the utilization rate of CO2 is a worth in-depth study. In light of this, this paper carries out the study on improving the CO2 flooding efficiency by using oil and gas amphiphilic surfactants. First of all, according to the molecular structure theory and the solubility experiment of surfactants in CO2, five kinds of surfactants and two kinds of additives with good performance of oil and gas were selected. Then, three experiments were conducted to explore the mechanism of the selected surfactants. The main mechanism of promoting the miscibility of CO2-crude oil is to reduce the interfacial tension of the oil and gas phases, followed by increasing the volume expansion of crude oil and reducing the viscosity of crude oil. Finally, through the slim tube displacement experiment, the oil displacement efficiency effect of adding the compound systems of SPO5/n-pentanol was simulated. The results show that the oil displacement efficiency is significantly higher than that of pure CO2 flooding, and the pressure of miscibility reduces at the same time. The selected reagents have a good effect of promoting miscibility. Therefore, this is an effective method to improve the geological utilization of CO2.

This strategy provides a unique organocatalytic atroposelective route to axially chiral aryl-C2-indole skeletons with excellent enantioselectivity and functional-group tolerance. This transformation was applicable to decagram-scale preparation (50.0 g) with perfect enantioselectivity through simple recrystallization. Moreover, the utility of this reaction was demonstrated by a variety of transformations towards chiral naphthyl-C2-indoles for a series of carbon-heteroatom bond formations. Furthermore, the prepared axially chiral naphthyl-C2-indoles were applied as a chiral skeleton for organocatalytic aza-Baylis-Hillman reaction and asymmetric formal [4+2] tandem cyclization to give the corresponding adducts in high yields with improved enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

Bacillus subtilis BS-37 was a high-yield mutation strain; the titers of surfactin was 413 mg/l and 585 mg/l with 74.2% and 51.6% proportions of C15-surfactin when BS-37 was cultured in LB medium and glucose medium, respectively. The surfactin products had a low critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 20 mg/l (20 mu M), and showed nice stability under strong alkali environment, high concentration of minerals and high temperature. The more C15-surfactin content in products, the better oil-washing efficiency and oil displacement efficiency was. At the concentration of 30 mg/l, surfactin products showed 88.5% of oil-washing efficiency and 13.48% of crude oil displacement efficiency, suggesting its promising application in enhancing oil recovery.

A dual dependence of peak current on sweeping rate, which can be attributed for the accumulation of reaction products, was observed on the sensor. Electrochemical analysis of the particulate Cu2O for detecting H2O2 and glucose is described, showing remarkable sensitivity in both cases. The estimated detection limits and sensitivities for H2O2 (0.0039 mu M, 52.3 mA mM(-1) cm(-2)) and glucose (47.2 mu M, 0.19 mA mM(-1) cm(-2)) suggest that the response for H2O2 detection was much higher than for glucose detection. Electron microscopy observation suggested that the hierarchical structures of Cu2O resulting from self-assembly of nanocrystals are responsible for the specific electrochemical properties.

A catalytic strategy has been developed that separates C-O hydrogenolysis and aromatic hydrogenation on different active catalysts with interoperation that can achieve high oxygen removal in lignin-derived oxygenates. The flexible use of tungsten carbide for C-O bond cleavage and a nickel catalyst with controlled particle size for arene hydrogenation enables the tunable production of cyclohexane and cyclohexanol with almost full conversion of guaiacol. Such integration of dual catalysts in close proximity enables superior HDO of bio-oils into liquid alkanes with high mass and carbon yields of 27.9 and 45.0 wt %, respectively. This finding provides a new effective strategy for practical applications.

Grazing enhances plant photosynthetic capacity by altering soil nitrogen in alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Alpine plants; Stomatal conductance; Photosynthesis; Soil nitrogen; SEM modeling	WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; SPECIES COMPOSITION; INNER-MONGOLIA; CARBON STORAGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HERBIVORE; ECOSYSTEM; BIOMASS; GROWTH; FERTILIZATION	The eco-physiological processes associated with the influences of grazing on plant traits and soil properties of alpine grasslands has remained poorly understood. To determine the effects of grazing on photosynthesis of alpine grassland plants, we measured nutrient level in plant and soil, as well as photosynthetic parameters of common herbage species in the grazed and fenced plots of an alpine meadow and an alpine steppe on Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The results showed that grazing significantly enhanced most herbages' carbon(C) and nitrogen (N) content, net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), transpiration rate (Tr), water use efficiency (WUE) and light use efficiency (LUE), as well as soil C and N content. Through the SEM modeling, we found both direct and indirect paths that grazing enhanced plants photosynthetic capacity. Grazing can directly enhance soil N content and thus promote plant N uptake, further increase plant gs, WUE and LUE, finally promote the A of plants. Additionally, grazing can also directly enhanced plant photosynthetic capacity through promoting the plant gs. Soil N and plant gs are the two key factors that determine the improvement of photosynthetic capacity under grazing. Sustainable moderate grazing management is expected to promote the photosynthetic potentials of alpine plants mainly through the improvement of soil N.

The molecule reacts with each surface at temperatures below 150 K, although the extent of reaction is greater on the TiC surface. XPS and HREELS results indicate that the first step in this chemistry is the cleavage of the CH3O-CHO bond, generating surface methoxy groups (CH3O-) and either carbon monoxide on VC or a formyl (CHO) group on TiC. The methoxy group reacts further on both surfaces via pathways expected based on previous methanol adsorption studies, primarily decomposing through a formyl intermediate on VC to generate formaldehyde and evolving methanol on TiC. The formyl group formed directly from methyl formate on TiC enables the production and evolution of formaldehyde, and also appears to break down further to the elements. These results indicate a propensity for these carbides to react with esters, leading potentially to the beneficial formation of friction lowering surface films or the deleterious degradation of ester-based lubricants.

Here, we analyzed leaf carbon isotope ratios as a measure of water use efficiency (WUE), proportions of fog, rain, and soil water use, and foliar water uptake (FWU) in species of epiphyte and their host trees in a tropical karst dwarf forest in China during the dry season. We found that the WUE, as represented by leaf C-13, was generally enriched in the epiphyte species compared to their host trees. Epiphytes used substantial proportions of fog water, whereas water use in the host trees was dominated by soil water. The leaves of epiphytes and host trees absorbed water following immersion in water for 3 h and FWU possibly related to foliar epicuticular structures, such as fungal endophytes. Our results show a divergence of water use strategies between epiphytes and their hosts and highlight the importance of fog water for epiphytes during the dry season and under a climate change scenario with a reduced occurrence of fog events.

Five different treatments (CN0, CN1, CN2, CN4 and CN6, respectively) were used, which involved addition of extra carbohydrate with variable ratios of elementary organic carbon to NO3--N by weight (C/NO3--N ratio equal to 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6, respectively). With CN2, CN4, and CN6 treatments, NO3--N was decreased (with increasing alkalinity) to <= 6.42 +/- 0.30 mg.L-1 and low amounts (close to zero) of nitrite (NO2--N) were achieved. However, there were high concentrations of residual NO3--N and/or NO2--N in CN0 and CN1. CN2 achieved the best denitrification, wherein 81.00 +/- 0.95% of the initial input nitrogen was removed. By fitting the equations, the highest nitrogen recycling rate (23.08 mg-N.g-C-1) was achieved with a C/NO3--N ratio of 4.16. Denitrifying bacteria were the dominant bacteria in all extra carbohydrate added treatment groups. Although denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms contributed to the removal of phosphorus, high concentrations of residual soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) were observed in all treatment groups. Overall, extra addition of carbohydrate with C/NO3--N ratio >= 2 is advisable for nitrogen removal, while the highest nitrogen recycling rate will be achieved with a ratio of 4.16.

Conducting polymers, such as polyaniline (PANi), have been suggested as promising electrode materials for flexible biocompatible energy storage systems, based on their intrinsic structural flexibility and potential polymer chain compatibility with biological interfaces. However, due to structural disorder triggering insufficient electronic conductivity and moderate electrochemical stability, PANi still cannot fully satisfy the requirements for flexible and biocompatible energy storage systems. Herein, we report a biocompatible physiological electrolyte activated flexible supercapacitor encompassing crystalline tetra-aniline (c-TANi) as the active electrode material, which significantly enhances the specific capacitance and electrochemical cycling stability with chloride electrochemical interactions. The crystallization of TANi endows it with sufficient electronic conductivity (8.37 S cm(-1)) and a unique Cl- dominated redox charge storage mechanism. Notably, a fully self-healable and biocompatible supercapacitor has been assembled by incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) with c-TANi as a self-healable electrode and a ferric-ion cross-linked sodium polyacrylate (Fe3+-PANa)/0.9 wt% NaCl as a gel electrolyte. The as-prepared device exhibits a remarkable capacitance retention even after multiple cut/healing cycles. With these attractive features, the c-TANi electrode presents a promising approach to meeting the power requirements for wearable or implantable electronics.

The 11-kilometer deep Challenger Deep is the least explored due to the technical challenges of sampling hadal depths. It receives organic matter and heavy metals from the overlying water column that accumulate differently across its V-shaped topography. Here, we collected sediments across the slope and bottom-axis of the Challenger Deep that enable insights into its in situ microbial communities. Analyses of 586 metagenome-assembled genomes retrieved from 37 metagenomes show distinct diversity and metabolic capacities between bottom-axis and slope sites. 26% of prokaryotic 16S rDNA reads in metagenomes were novel, with novelty increasing with water and sediment depths. These predominantly heterotrophic microbes can recycle macromolecules and utilize simple and complex hydrocarbons as carbon sources. Metagenome and metatranscriptome data support reduction and biotransformation of arsenate for energy gain in sediments that present a two-fold greater accumulation of arsenic compared to non-hadal sites. Complete pathways for anaerobic ammonia oxidation are predominantly identified in genomes recovered from bottom-axis sediments compared to slope sites. Our results expand knowledge of microbially-mediated elemental cycling in hadal sediments, and reveal differences in distribution of processes involved in nitrogen loss across the trench.

There is an immediate quest to find suitable diamond surfaces for NV sensors. In this work, the surface terminators of (113) diamond to host shallow NV centers are studied by means of first principles calculations. Results indicate that complete oxygen termination of (113) diamond creates positive electron affinity with neither strain on the surface nor in-gap levels. This is a very surprising result as the commonly employed oxygenated (001) diamond surface is often defective due to the disorder created by the strain of ether groups at the surface that seriously undermine the coherence properties of the shallow NV centers. The special atomic configurations on (113) diamond surface are favorable for oxygen bonding, in contrast to (001) and (111) diamond surfaces. These simulations imply that oxygenated diamond (113) surface can be produced by conventional diamond chemical vapor deposition growth. Combining this with the similar to 73% preferential alignment of as-grown NV centers in (113) oriented diamond, oxygenated (113) diamond is presently supposed to be the most prospective host for NV quantum sensors.

The chemical characterizations of twenty one source profiles were obtained, based on elements (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb and Zn), soluble ions (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, K+, Na+ and Ca2+) and carbonaceous material such as organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). The profiles vary between sources from different areas, as well as between different particulate sizes. Results show that particulate matter that originated as soil dust, construction dust and fugitive dust is typically rich in crustal elements, especially Al, Ca, Fe and Mg, while the presence of calcium is found to be a hallmark of the cement industry and ceramic industry. Dominant compositions of particles from coal-fired power plants are variable, with OC ranging from 22%-27%. Garbage-fired power plant and cooking smoke particulate emissions are enriched in Na, Cl-, OC and K due to the presence of salty and organic matter. The element Fe, ranging from 6.1% to 26.0%, is found to be an important marker for steel production dust Vehicle exhaust profiles are characterized by high abundances of OC (12.1%-53.6%) and EC (3.9%-20.0%). Burning of straw results in K (1.6%-7.2%) and OC (12.4%-25.9%) being the dominant composition. Preliminary work has also been done on establishing local industrial profiles such as textile, ceramic and electroplating industries. This work could be used in receptor model studies to estimate the contributions of different sources to the size-fractionated particulate matter in the Yangtze River Delta. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Formation mechanism of nanostructures in austenitic stainless steel during equal channel angular pressing	PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE			English	Article							SEVERE PLASTIC-DEFORMATION; STACKING-FAULT ENERGY; INDUCED GRAIN-REFINEMENT; ATTRITION TREATMENT; SURFACE-LAYER; ZR ADDITIONS; STRAIN-RATE; TRANSFORMATION; EVOLUTION; COPPER	An ultra-low carbon austenitic stainless steel was successfully pressed from one to eight passes by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) at room temperature. By using X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, the microstructural evolution during ECAP was investigated to reveal the formation mechanism of strain-induced nanostructures. The refinement mechanism involved the formation of shear bands and deformation twins, followed by the fragmentation of twin lamellae, as well as successive martensite transformation from parent austenitic grains with sizes ranging from microns to nanometres through the processes gamma(fcc)->epsilon(hcp)->alpha'(bcc). After pressing for eight passes, two types of nanocrystalline grains were achieved: ( a) nanocrystalline austenite with a mean grain size of similar to 31nm and (b) strain-induced nanocrystalline alpha'-martensite with a size of similar to 74nm. The formation mechanisms are discussed in terms of microstructural subdivision via deformation twinning and martensite transformation.

Dynamics simulation and reaction pathway analysis of characteristics of soot particles in ethylene oxidation at high temperature	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED CHEMISTRY			English	Article							POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; PARTICULATE FORMATION; PREMIXED FLAMES; COMBUSTION; GROWTH	Soot particles characteristics were investigated numerically for high temperature oxidation of C2H4/O-2/N-2 (C/O ratio of 2.2) in a closed jet-stirred/plug-flow reactor (JSR/PFR) system. Based on the growth mechanism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), two mechanisms were used to explore the formation pathways of soot precursors and soot. Numerical results were compared with the experimental and reference data. The simulation results show that the value predicted for small molecule intermediates within A1 gives a strong regularity, consistent trend with reference data. However, with the hydrogen-abstraction-carbon-addition (HACA) growth mechanism, the predicted value for beyond-A1 PAH macromolecules and soot volume fraction are smaller than the experimental data. The results also show that the predicted soot volume fraction is in good agreement with experimental data when a combination of the HACA and PAHs condensation (HACA + PAH-PAH) growth mechanisms is used. Analyses of the A1 sensitivity and reaction pathway elucidated that A1 are mainly formed from C2H3, C2H2, C3H3, C6H5OH, A1C(2)H and A1-. The reaction 2C(3)H(3) -> A1 is the dominant route of benzene formation. The prediction results and an analysis of the A3 reaction pathway indicate that the growth process from benzene to larger aromatic hydrocarbons (beyond two-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs]) goes by two pathways, i.e., HACA combined with the PAH-PAH radical recombination and addition reaction growth mechanisms.

However, its high potential barrier upon the initial activation process leads to a low utilization of Li2S. In this work, a Li2S/graphite full cell with the zero activation potential barrier is achieved through an in situ electrochemical conversion of Li2S8 catholyte into the amorphous Li2S. Theoretical calculations indicate that the zero activation potential for amorphous Li2S can be ascribed to its lower Li extraction energy than that of the crystalline Li2S. The constructed Li2S/graphite full cell delivers a high discharge capacity of 1006 mAh g(-1), indicating a high utilization of the amorphous Li2S as a cathode. Moreover, a long cycle life with 500 cycles for this Li2S/graphite full cell is realized. This in situ electrochemical conversion strategy designed here is inspired for developing high energy Li2S-based full cells in future.

Abstract The study proposes a retrofitting method with an optimum design of viscous dampers in order to improve the structural resistant capacity to earthquakes. The retrofitting method firstly uses a 2D frame model and places the viscous dampers in the structure to satisfy the performance requirements under code-specific design earthquake intensities and then performs an optimum design to increase the structural collapse-resistant capacity. The failure pattern analysis and fragility analysis show that the optimum design leads to better performance than the original frame structure. For regular structures, it is demonstrated that the optimum pattern of viscous damper placement obtained from a 2D frame model can be directly used in the retrofitting of the 3D frame model. The economic loss and repair time analyses are conducted for the retrofitted frame structure under different earthquake intensities, including the frequent earthquake, the occasional earthquake, and the rare earthquake. Although the proposed method is based on time-history analyses, it seems that the computational cost is acceptable because the 2D frame model is adopted to determine the optimum pattern of viscous damper placement; meanwhile, the owner can clearly know the economic benefits of the retrofitting under different earthquake intensities. The retrofitting also causes the frame to have reduced environmental problems (such as carbon emission) compared to the original frame in the repair process after a rare earthquake happens.

Polypyrrole (PPy) was electrodeposited onto the surface of the l-Trp enriched pABSA, and then the l-Trp templates were removed, resulting in molecularly imprinted PPy/pABSA. To avoid the interference from the oxidation peak of PPy on the following electrochemical chiral recognition of Trp isomers, PPy was overoxidized by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The resultant molecularly imprinted overoxidized PPy (OPPy)/pABSA modified GCE exhibits higher affinity toward l-Trp than d-tryptophan (d-Trp); that is, the oxidation peak current of l-Trp is greatly higher than that of d-Trp at the molecularly imprinted OPPy/pABSA modified GCE.

Porous sulphur copolymer for gas-phase mercury removal and thermal insulation	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Inverse vulcanisation; Porous materials; Mercury capture; Insulators	LI-S BATTERIES; INVERSE VULCANIZATION; ELEMENTAL SULFUR; POLYMERS; CONDUCTIVITY; DIVINYLBENZENE; ELECTRODE; CARBONS	Removal of gas-phase mercury is vital in gas processing industries. Herein, we report the preparation of porous sulphur copolymers for capturing elemental mercury (Hg(0)) in the gas phase. Porous sulphur copolymers were prepared using porogen and an inverse-vulcanisation technique. Sulphur powder was mixed with a water-soluble porogen (NaCl) and cross-linked with divinyl benzene (DVB) at 165 degrees C, and the porous structure was later obtained by dissolving the porogen in water. The porosity of the copolymer was controlled by varying the amount of salt and cross-linker. The effect of pore volume and temperature on the adsorption of mercury from gas phase has been estimated. Samples with larger pore volumes showed a significant increase in adsorption capacity, reaching approximately 151 mu g/g at 60 degrees C. High sulphur content and the porous structure enhanced the adsorption capacity. Furthermore, the thermal conductivities of the porous copolymers were studied at a range temperature. Copolymers with relatively high cross-link densities showed the very low thermal conductivity of approximately 0.048 W/m K at 25 degrees C, which is much lower than that of pristine sulphur. Abundant availability of sulphur and a simple method of preparation could make porous sulphur copolymers potential candidates for mercury capture and thermal insulation.

The high-production of malic acid was expected to be obtained by an isolated strain with xylose as carbon source in this paper. Phylogenetic tree of ITS region analysis was carried out for identification and then the single factor experiments and response surface methodology were employed to optimize the fermentation process parameters. Identification showed that the strain HF-119 for malic acid production belonged to the Rhizopus delemar species. The optimal medium composition for malic acid production were as follows: xylose, yeast extract powder, (NH4)(2)SO4, MnSO4.H2O, FeSO4. 7H(2)O, MgSO4, KH2PO4 and CaCO3 were 80.0g/L, 2.97g/L, 2.0g/L, 0.21 g/L, 0.07g/L, 0.27g/L, 0.4g/L and 70g/L, respectively; the malic acid yield was 57.42g/L under this condition. The isolated strain Rhizopus delemar HF-119 can be used for malic acid production. The yield of malic acid was enhanced effectively through the fermentation process optimization.

In real life, these structures are possibly subjected to dry and hot climate. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the bond behavior between CFRP and steel at different temperatures. To examine the bond between CFRP and steel under hot climate, a total of twenty-one double strap joints divided into 7 groups were tested to failure at constant temperatures from 27 degrees C to 120 degrees C in this paper. The results showed that the joint failure mode changed from debonding along between steel and adhesive interface failure to debonding along between CFRP and adhesive interface failure as the temperature increased beyond the glass transition temperature (T-g) of the adhesive. The load carrying capacity decreased significantly at temperatures approaching or exceeding T-g. The interfacial fracture energy showed a similar degradation trend. Analytical models of the ultimate bearing capacity, interfacial fracture energy, and bond-slip relationship of CFRP-steel interface at elevated temperatures were presented.

J	Wang, SH; Li, S; Wei, B; Lu, X				Wang, Senhao; Li, Shuai; Wei, Bin; Lu, Xia			YInterfacial Engineering at Cathode/LATP Interface for High-Performance Solid-State Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; POLYMER ELECTROLYTE; ISSUES; LI; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; DEPOSITION; SAFETY	Solid-state rechargeable lithium batteries are considered as one of the promising energy storage technologies due to their safety and high energy density. While developing better solid-state batteries is hampered by the poor interfacial compatibility. In this work, one novel design of buffer layer using the Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)(3) (LATP) solid electrolyte is reported to address the poor compatibility and big migration gap at the electrode-solid electrolyte interface. Such a facile design works well on facilitating the interfacial ionic inter-diffusion by padding the gap of ionic conductivity between electrode and electrolyte, as well as passivating the electric activity of interface region to avoid the continuously interfacial degradation, hence makes the interface more homogeneous and intimate to deliver the superior electrochemical performance. Moreover, upon cycling, a new carbon-rich interphase is revealed from electron microscopy in the interface region, which probably plays an important role in stabilizing the structure and regulating the electron/ion fluxes. All these findings provide a rewarding avenue to resolve the interfacial issues of solid-state lithium ion batteries and the integrated electronic devices.

However, increased activity of metabolic enzymes is not usually considered an initiating event in the malignant process. Here, we investigate the possible role of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2) in lymphoma initiation. SHMT2 localizes to the most frequent region of copy number gains at chromosome 12q14.1 in lymphoma. Elevated expression of SHMT2 cooperates with BCL2 in lymphoma development; loss or inhibition of SHMT2 impairs lymphoma cell survival. SHMT2 catalyzes the conversion of serine to glycine and produces an activated one-carbon unit that can be used to support S-adenosyl methionine synthesis. SHMT2 induces changes in DNA and histone methylation patterns leading to promoter silencing of previously uncharacterized mutational genes, such as SASH1 and PTPRM. Together, our findings reveal that amplification of SHMT2 in cooperation with BCL2 is sufficient in the initiation of lymphomagenesis through epigenetic tumor suppressor silencing. Parsa et al. report a mechanism of lymphoma initiation involving cooperation of BCL2 and increased activity of the metabolic enzyme SHMT2, which imparts changes in DNA and histone methylation.

A surface modification technology of electroplating Cr followed by heat-diffusion in vacuum furnace is applied for AISI 304SS stainless steel in this paper to improve the Interfacial Contact Resistance (ICR) and corrosion resistance. The electrochemical tests such as potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarization in the simulation PEMFC environments are carried out and the ICR between the carbon paper (diffusion layer) and the sample is evaluated. The results show that ICR is reduced markedly and corrosion resistance is better than the untreated substrate steel. The modified stainless steel with high Cr surface may be better candidate for the bipolar plates of PEMFC. After polarization, the contact resistance increased in some content. A surface nitride formation is under going on to lower the ICR further. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The catalyst is derived from Co-doped Cu-BTC metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) by thermolysis in nitrogen atmosphere at temperatures ranging from 773 K to 1073 K. The best catalytic performance is achieved when cobalt to copper molar ratio is 0.4 and the precursor is calcined at 873 K. The characterization of prepared catalytic materials is done by multi-techniques including XRD, XPD, SEM, TEM, TG and BET analysis. The sum of their results reveal that the doping of cobalt helps the dispersion of nanoparticles of copper and cobalt and thermolysis temperature has an impact on both the particle size and the chemical states. The resulting catalyst CuCo0.4/C-873 shows 98.7% furfural conversion and 97.7% furfuryl alcohol selectivity in ethanol solvent with good stability which is better than most reported catalysts.

The catalyst was characterised by means of nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope, showing the existence of Pt and Sn as Pt3Sn alloy. The analysis of particle size distribution revealed that Pt-Sn nanoparticles have high dispersion and narrow particle size distribution with an average diameter of 1.7 +/- 0.4 nm. Its catalytic performance toward propane dehydrogenation was also investigated. The propane dehydrogenation reaction showed that the as-prepared Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited good dehydrogenation performance with the conversion of 27.1% and propylene selectivity of 93.3% after reacting 12 h owing to the close interaction between Pt and Sn components. Coke deposition of the used catalyst was characterised by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis method, revealing most of the carbon was on the surface of the support, which meant that more active sites to be accessible to maintain catalytic stability.

The results show that acidification synergism of SDS reduces the ash content in the coal, and significantly increases the volatile component, fixed carbon content and low calorific value. The addition of SDS increases the content of hydrogen groups and hydroxyl groups. Acidification synergism of SDS reduces the degree of fatty chain length and the degree of branching (d(fc-b)) in the coal samples. Besides, in terms of microcrystalline structure, addition of the SOS has a large influence on the parameters the average diameter of the aromatic layer (L-a) and the stacking height of the aromatic layer (L-c). The results of this paper are great significance for studying the mechanism of chemical properties of acidified coal. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A recently isolated strain, Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27, is promising as an efficient lactic acid production bacterium from biomass due to its broad substrate specificity. Additionally, its strictly anaerobic and thermophilic characteristics suppress contamination from other microoragnisms. Herein, we report the significant improvements of concentration and yield in lactic acid production from various lignocellulosic derived sugars, achieved by the carbon flux redirection through homologous recombination in T. aotearoense SCUT27. Results: T. aotearoense SCUT27 was engineered to block the acetic acid formation pathway to improve the lactic acid production. The genetic manipulation resulted in 1.8 and 2.1 fold increase of the lactic acid yield using 10 g/L of glucose or 10 g/L of xylose as substrate, respectively. The maximum L-lactic acid yield of 0.93 g/g glucose with an optical purity of 99.3% was obtained by the engineered strain, designated as LA1002, from 50 g/L of substrate, which is very close to the theoretical value (1.0 g/g of glucose). In particular, LA1002 produced lactic acid at an unprecedented concentration up to 3.20 g/L using 10 g/L xylan as the single substrate without any pretreatment after 48 h fermentation. The non-sterilized fermentative production of L-lactic acid was also carried out, achieving values of 44.89 g/L and 0.89 g/g mixed sugar for lactic acid concentration and yield, respectively. Conclusions: Blocking acetic acid formation pathway in T. aotearoense SCUT27 increased L-lactic acid production and yield dramatically. To our best knowledge, this is the best performance of fermentation on lactic acid production using xylan as the sole carbon source, considering the final concentration, yield and fermentation time. In addition, it should be mentioned that the performance of non-sterilized simultaneous fermentation from glucose and xylose was very close to that of normal sterilized cultivation. All these results used the mutant strain, LA1002, indicated that it is a new promising candidate for the effective production of optically pure L-lactic acid from lignocellulosic biomass.

SDI values were reduced in virtually all cases to below 3. In vertical wells, from 70 to 100% of the TEP and 50% of the TOC and DOC found in natural seawater were removed in the aquifer. Reduction in the concentration of the organic fractions was selective based on molecular weight with the biopolymers nearly fully removed. Humic substances, building blocks, and light organic substances were removed at lesser percentages. Site geology was not the predominant factor affecting the removal efficiency, but the length of the flow path from the sea to the wells and the hydraulic retention time appear to be most significant. A comparison between vertical wells, a tunnel intake system, and a horizontal drain system at Alicante, Spain, demonstrated that the vertical wells performed best followed by the tunnel system, and the horizontal drain system which showed a breakthrough of algae and a very high organic carbon concentration.

As a hot spot of wind erosion, Northern China suffers from severe wind erosion hazards. Besides, there is an ongoing controversy regarding the magnitudes of sand/dust emissions of anthropogenic sources. To understand the mechanism of soil degradation and environmental pollution caused by wind erosion, and to resolve the controversy whether sand/dust emissions is from natural or anthropogenic sources in Northern China, accurate spatio-temporal distributions of sand/dust emission should be obtained. Herein, a wind erosion model with a high spatio-temporal resolution was developed and employed to identify the sand and dust emissions of areas with different land cover types. The sand and dust emission hot spots from 2001 to 2014 were mainly distributed in the Gashun Gobi and Kumutage Deserts, those are all natural areas. In these regions, the average sand and dust emissions exceeded 10,000 kg/m/y (year) and 240 g/m(2)/y, respectively. The intensities of sand and dust emissions demonstrated significant decreasing trends during this time. According to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover data, the average sand/dust emission rates in natural sources were much higher than that in anthropogenic areas, e.g. from 2001 to 2014, the average annual dust emission of Northern China was about 130 Tg/y, and only approximately 3.7% of dust emissions originated from anthropogenic areas. Dust deflation correspondingly caused the entrainment of soil nutrients into atmosphere and result in soil degradation. Our results also show that the Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) loss due to wind erosion in Northern China was about 0.9 Tg/y and that 32.5% and 7.5% of the SOC loss originated from grasslands (including woody savannas, savannas, and grasslands) and farmlands (including croplands and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics), respectively. With regard to such severe sand and dust emissions, we believe that the results of this study could provide valuable information for the creation of strategies to cope with wind erosion hazards and measures to control the extent of wind-blown sand. In addition, the proposed model could be of interest to ecological and environmental researchers.

Due to different carbon dioxide (CO2) resources of different components of soil respiration, there may be different mechanisms by which soils respond to N additions. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of N additions on total soil respiration (RS (T)), rhizospheric respiration (RS (R)) and heterotrophic respiration (RS (H)), and to elucidate the potential causal mechanisms. An artificial N addition experiment was conducted in an evergreen broad-leaved forest at the western edge of the Sichuan Basin in China. The effects of three N treatment levels (+0, +50, +150 kg N ha(-1) yr.(-1)) were measured, with the N application initiated in April 2013. Trenching method was used for partitioning RS (T) into RS (T) and RS (R). The values of RS (T) and its components were measured monthly from May 2015 to April 2016. The mean annual RS (T) was 1.92 +/- 0.18 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), with RS (H) and RS (R) contributing 75 +/- 1% and 25 +/- 1% to RS (T), respectively. Nitrogen addition significantly reduced RS (T) and its two components, as well as the contribution of RS (R) to RS (T). Microbial biomass carbon (C) and pH in bulk soil decreased significantly after N application. Nitrogen addition had no effect on rhizospheric soil biochemical properties. RS (R) was significantly positively correlated with root biomass of Castanopsis platyacantha, while RS (H) was significantly positively correlated with the concentrations of microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN) for bulk soil. The positive correlation between RS (R) and root biomass indicates that N application reduced RS (R) by reducing belowground C allocation and thus C inputs to the rhizosphere. The value of RS (H) decreased primarily due to a reduction in microbial activity and soil organic matter decomposition in root-free soil after N was added. The presence of plant roots may mitigate the effect of N inputs to the rhizosphere via alteration of root morphology and exudates.

Therefore, the gene abundance variation can reveal the impact of interference on the material cycle of grassland. To study the cycle of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) between plant and soil in grassland under different grazing regimes, we investigated the soil microbial functional genes related to C, N, and P cycling by high-throughput quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA-based Illumina sequencing analysis under grazing exclusion (GE), rotational grazing (RG), and continuous grazing (CG) in alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, where climate is characterized by little rain and low temperature, and grassland is very sensitive to grazing. The results showed at the early grazing period, C fixtion (rbcL, korA, and frdA) and lignin degradation (abfA, xylA, exg, lig, exoPG, chiA, and glx) processes were slower under GE; CH4 metabolism (mcrA) was faster under CG; RG and CG improved the denitrification process (narG); RG slowed down organic-P mineralization (phoD). At the late grazing period, C fixation (accA and frdA) and degradation (mnp, apu, and amyA) processes were slower under GE; CH4 metabolism (pmoA and mxa) was faster under CG; RG and CG improved the ammonia-oxidizing (amoA2), nitrification (hao), and denitrification (nirS3 and nirK1) processes. The majority of the genes involved in C, N, and P cycling decreased, the C, N and P content in plant leaf decreased, while that of soil increased from early to late grazing period. No matter grazing or not, there were negative relationships between genes and soil nutrients, and positive relationships between genes and plant nutrients, implying a trade-off between plant nutrients and soil nutrients along the grazing time. The genes responsible for regulating C and N cycling were increased under grazing, implying that reasonable grazing is beneficial to the nutrients cycling of grassland.

High Precision Coulometry Study of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li Coin Cells	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; COULOMBIC EFFICIENCY; CAPACITY; ELECTRODES; BEHAVIOR; OXIDE	Two samples of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 with surface areas of 0.5 and 1.8 m(2)/g were synthesized from a co-precipitated hydroxide precursor. LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 electrodes with different ratios of active material, carbon black and PVDF were used in LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li cells. The cells were tested at currents corresponding to C/10, C/21 and C/43 and at temperatures of 30, 40 and 50 C on the High Precision Charger at Dalhousie University. Accurate measurements of the coulombic efficiency (CE) as well as the charge and discharge end point capacity slippages were made. There was a significant decrease of the CE as the active material surface area increased. The CE decreased proportionally to the increase in charge-discharge cycle time indicating that parasitic reactions at the positive electrode in these cells occur at a fixed rate at a given temperature. The CE decreased with increasing temperature showing that the parasitic reactions increased with temperature. More research is needed to improve the CE, along with suppression of electrolyte oxidation, before the commercial application of this electrode material can be contemplated.

In order to achieve a high efficiency of 2,3-BD production, K. oxytoca mutants deficient in ethanol formation were successfully constructed by replace the aldA gene coding for aldehyde dehydrogenase with a tetracycline resistance cassette. The results suggested that inactivation of aldA led to a significantly improved 2,3-BD production. The carbon flux to 2,3-BD was enhanced by eliminating the byproducing ethanol and at the same time reducing the accumulation of another byproduct acetoin. At last, by fed-batch culturing of the mutant, the final 2,3-BD titer up to 130 g/l with the productivity of 1.63 g/l.h and the 2,3-BD yield relative to glucose of 0.48 g/g was obtained.

Hipposideros armiger exhibited significant increases in forearm length and three diet-related cranial traits, as well as carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition, suggesting that modern H. armiger must travel farther for food and may now use different food resources. In contrast, R. leschenaultii showed no change in forearm length but displayed significant increases in diet-related cranial traits. This study provides evidence for differential responses to recent environmental changes in bat species with different diets. The changes in diet-related traits of the two species and the forearm length change on the insectivorous bats suggest that recent phenotypic changes may be adaptions to land-use changes rather than to climate change.

Due to the surface recombination effect between NMO and CVO, the as-prepared NMO@CVO effectively avoids the aggregation of CVO nanosphere clusters. The unique hybrid architecture can make the most of the large interfacial area and abundant active sites for storing charge, which is greatly beneficial for the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions and fast electron transport. The optimized NMO@CVO-8 composite nanostructure displays battery-like behavior with a maximum specific capacity of 357 C g(-1), excellent rate capability (77.8% retention with the current density increasing by 10 times) and remarkable cycling stability. In addition, an aqueous asymmetric energy storage device is assembled based on the NMO@CVO-8 hybrid nanorod/nanosphere clusters and activated carbon. The device shows an ultrahigh energy density of 48.5 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 839.1 W kg(-1), good rate capability (20.9 W h kg(-1) even at 7833.7 W kg(-1)) and excellent cycling stability (83.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). More notably, two charged devices in series can light up a red light-emitting diode (LED) for 20 min, demonstrating its potential in future energy storage applications. This work indicates that the hierarchical NiMoO4@Co3V2O8-8 hybrid nanorod/nanosphere clusters are promising energy storage materials for future practical applications and also provides a rational strategy for fabricating novel nanostructured materials for high-performance energy storage.

However, both the low density of single atomic (SA) MNx active sites and restricted mass transfer render these M-N-C based air electrodes inferior in cell performance. In this study, a new ZIF8-derived Fe-N-C catalyst/electrode design combining local chemistry tuning and primary morphology tailoring to address the above two critical issues is shown. The introduction of nitrogencarbon defects in ZIF8 host enables a controlled atomic-scale dispersion of FeNx moieties, increasing their content in support materials. Also, the simultaneous structural arrangement of individual ZIF8 nano-grains endows the catalyst with a unique porous micro-spheric morphology. This result in an advanced 3D air electrode featuring dense SA FeNx sites and ample, multiscale macro-sized pore channels, which can significantly increase the intrinsic catalytic activity, facilitate bulk mass transport, and generate more effective triple-phase interfaces for ORR. The present catalyst/electrode design exhibits a record large peak power density of ca. 0.60 W cm-2 under practical air conditions. This approach provides a feasible way for boosting the air cathode interfacial ORR and further enlightens electrode designs for energy devices involving multiphase electrochemical reactions.

Glass fiber reinforced polyetherimide (GF/PEI) laminate was joined using the pulse resistance welding technology, using a stainless steel (SS) mesh as the heating element. A single lap shear test was performed on the weldments of aramid fiber (AF) , glass fiber (GF), and carbon fiber (CF) as reinforcing agents to evaluate the strength of the welded joint. The results show that the fiber achieves the welding interface strengthening by cooperating with the SS mesh heating element to contribute to the mechanical properties of the welded joint. Fracture analysis shows that under the reinforcement of fiber, the main failure mode in the initial stage of welding is fiber and matrix debonding. When the strength of the weldment achieves the best, the failure mode is changed into the simultaneous tearing of SS mesh heating element and fiber tear.

Inert sweep gas is applied on the reduction side of the membrane. The model is based on conservation of mass, species, and energy along with the Gibbs criterion. The maximum thermodynamic solar-to-fuel efficiencies are determined by simultaneous multivariable optimization of operational parameters. The effects of gas heat recovery and reactor flow configurations are investigated. The results show that maximum efficiencies of 1.3% (3.2%) and 0.73% (2.0%) are attainable for water splitting (carbon dioxide splitting) under counter-and parallel-flow configurations, respectively, at an operating temperature of 1900K and 95% gas heat recovery effectiveness. In addition, insights on potential efficiency improvement for the membrane reactor system are further suggested. The efficiencies reported are found to be much lower than those reported in literature. We demonstrate that the thermodynamic models reported elsewhere can violate the Gibbs criterion and, as a result, lead to unrealistically high efficiencies. The present work offers enhanced understanding of the counter-flow membrane reactor and provides more accurate upper efficiency limits for membrane reactor systems.

Rutile SnO2 nanorod arrays grow vertically on the Ni foam surface with diameters of around 40 nm, lengths up to around 300 nm and Pd nano particles decorate on the top of SnO2 nanorods to form a mushroom-like electrode structure with SnO2 as stem and Pd nanoparticles as mushroom head. The Pd@SnO2/Ni foam electrode exhibits superior catalytic activity and excellent stability at the higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide(H2O2). The reduction current density achieves successfully 320 mA cm(-2) at -0.54 V, and it changes barely during 800 potential cycles in 0.5 mol L-1 H2O2 + 3.0 mol L-1 NaOH. The improved performance suggests its promising application as an efficient electrode for H2O2-based fuel cells.

This technology has been considered to possess a long-term growth potential, and it is expected to gradually reduce environmental pollution and over-exploitation of resources. In this context, we holistically review this technology and focused on the conversion of biomass into hydrogen using chemical methods (i.e., those with potential for obtaining H-2-rich producer gas streams). Several reaction parameters were discussed and classified herein including biomass conversion methods and conditions, hydrogen production and carbon conversion ratios, the effect of different catalysts types, the catalytic properties of these materials, and their related mechanisms. The overall findings provide new insights for the selection of highly effective and suitable hydrogen production catalysts by biomass conversion applications.

The resulting catalysts (Co-N/C) all showed strong catalytic activity toward the ORR, but the catalyst heat-treated at 700 degrees C yielded the best ORR activity. Co-N/C catalysts with several Co loadings - 064, 2.0, 2.96, 3.33, 5 28, and 7.18 wt% - were also synthesized and tested for ORR activity X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray analysis were used to characterize these catalysts in terms of their structure and composition. To achieve further quantitative evaluation of the catalysts in terms of their ORR kinetics and mechanism, rotating disk electrode and rotating ring-disk electrode techniques were used with the Koutecky-Levich theory to obtain several Important kinetic parameters. overall ORR electron transfer number, electron transfer coefficiency in the rate-determining step (RDS). chemical reaction rate constant. electron transfer rate constant in the RDS, exchange current density, and mole percentage of H2O2 produced in the catalyzed ORR. The overall electron transfer number for the catalyzed ORR was determined to be similar to 3 5 with 14% H2O2 production, suggesting that the ORR catalyzed by Co-N/C catalysts is a mixture of 2- and 4-electron transfer pathways, dominated by a 4-electron transfer process: based on these measurements. an ORR mechanism is proposed based on the literature and our understanding, to facilitate further investigation. The stability of a Co-N/C catalyst was also tested by fixing a current density to record the change in electrode potential with time. For comparison, two other catalysts. Fe-N/C and TPTZ/C, were also tested for stability under the same conditions as the Co-N/C catalyst. Among these three, the 5 wt% Co-N/C was most stable.

This study isolated an electrochemically active Pseudomonas sp. from an anaerobic sludge using a colorimetric and electrochromic WO3 nanorod (WO3- NR) probe. A strategy was developed to determine the presence of electroactive species from enriched cultures. A mixed consortium was enriched using Pseudomonas isolation media containing betaine and triclosan as the carbon source and antibacterial reagent, respectively. A single blue colony was isolated using WO3-NR sand-wiched agar plates. The isolate was sequenced by 16 s rRNA and designated Pseudomonas aeruginosa PBH03, producing phenazines and pyocyanin aerobically. The isolate exhibited clear electrochemical characteristics from cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry and produced a current density of 9.01 mu A cm(-2) in a microbial fuel cell.

In China, the population pressure compels the utilization of every piece of available land for food production. In this study, we investigated the content, leachability and possible storage sinks for Cr and other metals in soils around facilities of leather industry in southern China. It was found that Cr in soils impacted by tannery can be as high as 2484 mg Cr kg(-1) soil, and the mean contents of other metals such as Zn (214 mg Zn kg(-1) soil), Cd (5.4 mg Cd kg(-1) soil), As (17 mg As kg(-1) soil) exceeded the soil quality standards and guidelines in China and Canada. Simulated leaching studies (i.e., Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure) indicated that these soils could release Cr and other metals in concentrations above the environmental quality guidelines and standards for water in China and Canada. As a result, the mobility of metals from these soils can potentially contaminate both groundwater and surface water. We also found differential leachability of metals with soil properties such as total metal and total carbon contents. Principal component analysis of the total contents of 32 elements showed that the possible major sinks for Cr are organic matter and oxides of Fe/Mn/Al, while sulfates and phosphates are potential storage of Cd, Zn, Cu and Pb. The information obtained from this study can be valuable for the restoration of ecosystem functions (i.e., food production) in the study area.

The C-7 xylosidase produced by the four strains obtained was an extracellular inducible enzyme enabling the biotransformation to be carried out directly in microbial suspension cultures. The four strains were identified as Streptomyces matensi, Arthrobacter nicotianae, Achromobacter piechaudii, and Pseudomonas plecoglossicida by morphological, physiological, and genetical characteristics. Several chemicals were confirmed as activating the enzyme activity, in which magnesium acetate improved the maximal substrate concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 g l(-1) at complete transformation in S. matensi suspension cultures. The non-mucous, extracellular activity and high substrate concentration characters of S. matensi facilitate both the upstream production of the enzyme, and downstream extraction and purification of the enzyme and the product.

In this study, the water acquisition patterns of a hemiepiphyte, Ficus tinctoria, is investigated in relation to growth phase (epiphytic, transitional and terrestrial) and season (foggy, hot-dry and rainy). Stable isotope compositions of water in xylem, soil, canopy humus, fog and rainfall were sampled on seasonally distinct dates, and soil water content and leaf carbon isotope composition were measured in order to determine the proportion of different water sources. Results indicated that F.tinctoria displayed a high degree of plasticity in source-water acquisition associated with the growth-phase transition from purely canopy-rooted epiphyte to transitional plant to terrestrial tree. During the foggy season and the hot-dry season, epiphytes utilized a combination of recently received rainwater (82-89%) and fog water (11-18%) present in canopy humus soil, whereas terrestrial trees exclusively depended on shallow and deep terrestrial soil water and exhibited marked flexibility in depth of soil water uptake. Transitional-phase plants relied predominantly on shallow soil water (79-86%) and extracted only a small fraction of canopy humus water (14-21%). During the rainy season, epiphytes relied almost exclusively on recent rainwater (96%) and had a negligible water uptake from fog, whereas trees extracted their water primarily from the shallow soil and less from the deep soil. Plants in transitional-phase drew a considerable fraction of water from canopy humus soil. This plasticity of source-water uptake to cope with radical changes in rooting environment is likely the key feature enabling hemiepiphytic species to thrive and successfully establish in the tropical rainforests.

In this study, oil-in-water Pickering emulsion gelation approach was combined with freeze-drying to prepare foam-based microwave absorbers along with appealing photo-thermal conversion and thermal insulation. In hybrid foam, cellulose nanofibrils (CNP) and polylactic acid (PLA) serve as three-dimensional skeleton, where carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles are homogeneously incorporated, which forms a conductive network with hetero-interfaces. The optimal reflection loss value of the foam reaches -65.14 dB with a thickness of 3.0 mm. The foam also demonstrate high photo-thermal conversion performance with its surface temperature up to 97 degrees C after irradiation under 1 Sun for 5 min. Additionally, the foam shows superior thermal insulation comparing with the commercial polyvinyl alcohol and polyurethane foams. This study may offer a promising approach to develop ultralight and high-performance microwave absorber with great potential for multifunctional applications.

The oil sample was diluted with carbon tetrachloride and was placed in a quartz cuvette with a thickness of 1 cm to record the FTIR spectrum. The peak at 3535 cm (1), which corresponds to the O-H stretch of the carboxyl group in free fatty acids, together with the peak valley at 3508 cm (1) and the spectral data in the range of 3340-3390 cm (1) were used to determine the AV of the edible oil. The excellent linear relationship between the AVs measured in this work and those measured using a titration method, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9929, indicates that the present procedure can be applied as an alternative to the classic method for determining the AVs of edible oils.

With non-treated molasses as carbon source, 12.69 +/- 0.40 g l(-1) of propionic acid was attained at 120 h in free-cell fermentation, whereas the PFB fermentation yielded 41.22 +/- 2.06 g l(-1) at 120 h and faster cells growth was observed. In order to optimize the fermentation outcomes, fed-batch fermentation was performed with hydrolyzed molasses in PFB, giving 91.89 +/- 4.59 g l(-1) of propionic acid at 254 h. Further studies were carried out using hydrolyzed waste propionibacterium cells as substitute nitrogen source, resulting in a propionic acid concentration of 79.81 +/- 3.99 g l(-1) at 302 h. The present study suggests that the low-cost molasses and waste propionibacterium cells can be utilized for the green and economical production of propionic acid by P. freudenreichii.

However, the impact of chemical fertilizers on abiotic and biotic characteristics of soil is unclear. Here, we investigated the variations in soil chemical properties and bacterial communities of sugarcane soil after a five-year chemical fertilization period with five different regimes, namely, Control (no fertilizer), PK (phosphorus plus potassium fertilizer), NK (nitrogen plus potassium fertilizer), NP (nitrogen plus potassium fertilizer), and NPK (combined nitrogen, phosphorus plus potassium fertilizer). We found that N-addition fertilizer treatments resulted in lower bacterial biodiversity as estimated by Chao1 and Shannon's indexes. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteria were the predominant phyla in all of the fertilizer treatments. The concentrations of different N forms (TN, NH4+-N, and NO3-N) were the most important factors in shaping bacterial community structure. Functional groups involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling significantly increased or decreased with chemical N-related fertilizer treatments (NK, NP, and NPK). The community composition and functions related to element cycling of soil bacteria were strongly affected by N-containing fertilizer treatments. The results suggest that bacterial communities in sugarcane soil may have been phylogenetically and functionally altered in response to chemical fertilization.

YL and treated YL (TYL) samples were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermogravimetric analyzer, solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The results show that the yield of soluble portion from each TYL with a co-solvent is much higher than that with the IL alone due to the decrease in the solvent viscosity and increase in the interactions between the IL and YL. The particles in the TYL samples are smaller than those in YL based on the observation with the SEM, and the TYL samples have more mass loss than YL during pyrolysis, suggesting that the TD destroyed the texture and structure of YL to some extent. Compared to YL, the TYL samples have more aliphatic carbons. The physicochemical changes of the TYL samples indicate that the co-solvents are effective for treating coals and the TYL samples are more appropriate for liquefaction and pyrolysis.

A total of 390 specimens, including 234 carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens and 156 glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) specimens, were exposed to freeze-thaw cycles, hygrothermal aging, and wet-dry cycles either in an unstressed state or loaded to about 30% or 60% of the initial ultimate load. Uniaxial tension tests were conducted on the samples after specific exposure time as well as on the control samples; and tensile properties were measured for each specimen. The results showed that the three environmental exposures, particularly hygrothermal aging, led to a significant decrease in tensile strength and elongation of the CFRP and GFRP specimens even for relatively short conditioning periods, and this decrease was markedly exacerbated by higher external loading levels. It was interesting to observe that the tensile modulus of the CFRP and GFRP specimens exhibited an excellent resistance and even appeared to increase slightly after exposure. Finally, predictive values of tensile strength based on the Arrhenius method were compared with the design values of ACI 440.2R-08 and GB 50608-2010. The results showed that both ACI 440.2R-08 and GB 50608-2010 were too conservative and significantly underestimated the tensile strength of FRP materials after an anticipated exposure period.

Six oscillation events were identified: Oldest Dryas, Bolling, Older Dryas, Allerod, Intra-Allerod Cold Period (IACP) and Younger Dryas (YD). The summer monsoon was weaker during Oldest Dryas and Younger Dryas when the winter monsoon was stronger. However, during the B/A (Bolling/Allerod) period, the summer monsoon strengthened, reflected by magnetic susceptibility, when the winter monsoon also became strong, which is different from the paleoclimatic pattern established in the East Asian monsoon region. Furthermore, the summer monsoon was nearly in phase with the climate changes inferred from the oxygen isotopic records of Greenland ice cores. It could be speculated that the variations of the sea ice cover in the high latitudes of the North Hemisphere affected the high pressure of Asian continent and the changes of the winter monsoon inland. On the other hand, the sea ice cover variations might have indirectly caused the occurrence of ENSO events that has tightly been related to the summer monsoon in northwest margin of East Asian monsoon region.

A novel kind of quaternary amine anionicexchange MOFs UiO-66 namely UiO-66-NMe3+ was firstly synthesized for adsorptive removal of a widely used toxic herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) from aqueous solutions. The well-prepared UiO-66-Me-3(+) MOFs were fully characterized, and then the main parameters affecting the adsorption process including solution pH, adsorbent dosage and coexisting anions were systematically investigated. The maximum adsorption capacity of UiO-66-NMe3+ toward 2,4-D reached as high as 279 mg g(-1), much higher than that of pristine UiO-6 and aminated UiO-66. The adsorption mechanism could be attributed to the electrostatic interactions efficiently enhanced by the functionalization of quaternary amine groups, combining with the p-p conjugations between the linkers in MOFs and 2,4-D molecules, leading to the better adsorption performance of UiO-66-Me-3(+). Additionally, the UiO-66-NMe3+ could be well regenerated by simple solvent washing and exhibited a slight decline of adsorption capacity after seven successive recycle. Furthermore, satisfactory adsorption capacity and reusability of the MOFs in environmental water samples were attained. Comparing with reported activated carbon and resin materials, the UiO-66-NMe3+ MOFs possessed higher adsorption capacity and shorter equilibrium time, as well as good reusability and practicality. The developed ion-exchange functionalized MOFs provided an ideal alternative for efficient adsorptive-removal of 2,4-D from complicated aqueous environment.

To obtain fully oxidized GO, an orthogonal array design L-9 was applied to select the optimum preparing conditions. The effects of the quantity of graphite, the quantity of KMnO4, reaction time, and temperature on the degree of oxidization of GO were evaluated by the orthogonal array design (OAD). The results show that the factors arranged in important order as the follows: reaction time, reaction temperature, the quantity of KMnO4, the quantity of graphite. Graphite oxide obtained at the optimal parameters by the improved method was characterized by UV-Vis, FT-IR, Raman spectrum, and XRD techniques, and compared with GO produced by the modified Hummers' method. The results indicate that the GO obtained by the improved green synthesis method has fewer defects in the basal plane and is more oxidized than the modified Hummers' method.

Thidiazuron (TDZ) was the key plant growth regulator for inducing somatic embryogenesis and kinetin (KIN) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) were the key cytokinins for inducing shoot organogenesis from leaf explants. TDZ combined with BAP or KIN in the induction Murashige and Skoog medium induced both somatic embryos and adventitious shoots. Leaf explants with abaxial site in contact with the medium induced less somatic embryos or adventitious shoots compared to inversely placed leaf explants and the optimum pH was 6.5-7.0. Secondary somatic embryos or adventitious shoot could be induced from primary somatic embryos using TDZ and BAP. Shoots developed adventitious roots on rooting medium containing 0.5 mu M indole-3-butyric acid and 0.2 % activated carbon. Over 90 % of plantlets survived following acclimatization and transfer to potting mixture (sand:Vermiculite:limestone; 1:2:1).	[Ma, G. H.; He, C. X.; Ren, H.; Zhang, Q. M.; Li, S. J.; Zhang, X.

Each reaction mixture was sequentially extracted with methanol and isometric carbon disulfide/acetone mixed solvent in a modified Soxhlet extractor to afford extracts a and b, respectively. According to the analysis with a Curie-point pyrolyzer-gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, the main products from the flash pyrolysis of E-a320, i.e., E-a obtained from XL methanolysis at 320 degrees C, are phenolic compounds. The analysis with a quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer indicates that N3O2-N3O4 are predominant nitrogen-and oxygen-containing class species (NOCCSs) in E-a320. In the NOCCSs, nitrogen atoms mainly exist in the forms of pyridine, imidazole or pyrazole, and pyrazine or pyrimidine, while the main oxygen atoms exist in alkoxy, furan, ester or carbonyl group. In addition, possible pathways for the formation of the NOCCSs were speculated.

Moreover, n-dodecane hydroisomerization performance of Pt supported ZSM-22 and ZSM-48 were investigated. The catalytic results showed that the activity and the isomers selectivity of n-dodecane hydroisomerization could be improved by alkali treatment. The isomers distributions were distinct for Pt/ZSM-48 and Pt/ZSM-22. Mono-branched isomers near the end of the chains were more prone to be generated on Pt/ZSM-22 catalyst, which suggested "pore-mouth" catalysis model dominating the hydroisomerization catalysis. However, di-branched isomers and mono-branched isomers with methyl near the middle of the carbon chains were favorable to be formed over Pt/ZSM-48 catalyst according to the "key-lock" catalysis model. Moreover, more central-branched isomers were formed at high reaction temperature (> 320 degrees C) especially for Pt/ HZSM-22. [GRAPHICS] .

Here, we applied high-throughput RNA sequencing to generate two transcriptional maps of R. oryzae following fermentation in glucose or xylose. The differential expression analysis showed that, genes involved in amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis, were up-regulated in response to xylose. Moreover, we discovered the potential presence of oxidative stress in R. oryzae during xylose fermentation. To adapt to this unfavorable condition, R. oryzae displayed reduced growth and induce of a number of antioxidant enzymes, including genes involved in glutathione, trehalose synthesis, and the proteasomal pathway. These responses might divert the flow of carbon required for the accumulation of fumaric acid. Furthermore, using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we identified a large number of novel transcripts and a substantial number of genes that underwent alternative splicing. Our analysis provides remarkable insight into the mechanisms underlying xylose fermentation by R. oryzae. These results may reveal potential target genes or strategies to improve xylose fermentation.

In this paper, Ni catalysts with the different supports (CeO2/Al2O3, La2O3/Al2O3, MgO/Al2O3, ZrO2/Al2O3) were prepared by two-step impregnation method. The fresh and used catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), scanning electron microscopy with an Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) specific surface area measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Thermo-gravimetric analyses (TGA). The catalyst performance testing was conducted by SCWG of glucose at 673 K and 23.5 MPa with an autoclave reactor, to evaluate the influence of support on the hydrogen production. The results showed that H-2 yield for different supports decreased in order: CeO2/Al2O3 > La2O3/Al2O3 > MgO/Al2O3 > Al2O3 > ZrO2/Al2O3, and H-2 selectivity decreased in order: CeO2/Al2O3 > La2O3/Al2O3 > ZrO2/Al2O3 > Al2O3 > MgO/Al2O3. Ni catalysts were deactivated in SCWG reaction because of sintering and coke deposition. Compared with other supports, CeO2 can be used as the promoter of carbon removal from catalyst surfaces.

The computational results indicated that the dehydrogenation of tritiated methane is endothermic. The decomposition of tritiated methane catalyzed by Ni to form Ni-based carbon (Ni-C) after a four-step dehydrogenation companied with releasing tritium. After the first and second dehydrogenation steps, Ni+CT4 formed NiCT2. After the third and fourth dehydrogenation steps, NiCT2 formed NiC. The first and second steps of dehydrogenation occurred on both the singlet and triplet states, and the lowest energy route is Ni + CT4 -> (COM)-C-1 -> (TS1)-T-1 -> (IM1)-I-3 -> (TS2)-T-3 -> (IM2)-I-3. The third and fourth steps of dehydrogenation occurred on both the singlet and quintet states, and the minimum energy reaction pathway appeared to be IM3 -> (TS4)-T-1 -> (IM4)-I-5 -> (5)TS5 -> (5)IM5 -> (5)pro + T-2. The fourth step of dehydrogenation TNiCT -> T2NiC was the rate-determining step of the entire reaction with the rate constant of k(2) = 2.8 x 10(13) exp(-313,136/RT) (in cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)), and its activation energy barrier was calculated to be 51.8 kcal/mol. The Ni-catalyzed CH4 and CD4 cracking dehydrogenation processes are also investigated and the hydrogen isotope effect is evaluated. The hydrogen isotope effect value of k(H)/k(T) is computed to be 2.94, and the value of k(D)/k(T) is computed to be 1.39. The catalytic dehydrogenation reactions of methane and deuterated methane are likely to occur, accompanied by the tritiated methane catalytic cracking reaction in the fusion process.

In this study, the thermophilic strain Aeribacillus pallidus SL-1 was evaluated for the biodegradation of crude oil and PAHs at 60 degrees C. Strain SL-1 was found to preferentially degrade short-chain n-alkanes (< C17) and aromatic hydrocarbons from crude oil. The highest degradation rate of 84% was obtained with 1000 mg/l naphthalene as sole carbon source. Additionally, the strain was able to degrade 80% of phenanthrene (200 mg/l) and 50% of pyrene (50 mg/l) within 5 days at 60 degrees C. The SL-bioemulsifier produced by strain SL-1 was identified as a glycoprotein with stable emulsifying activity over a wide range of environmental conditions. Chemical composition studies exhibited that the SL-bioemulsifier consisted of polysaccharides (65.6%) and proteins (13.1%), among them, proteins were the major emulsifying functional substrates. Furthermore, the SL-bioemulsifier was able to enhance the solubility of PAHs. Thus, the bioemulsifier-producing strain SL-1 has great potential for applications in high-temperature bioremediation.

In order to improve the compatibility between the ceramic fillers and polymer matrix without damage of dielectric properties, surface modifiers with less carbon remain are preferred. In this paper, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) is employed as a surface modifier to improve the compatibility between the (Ca, Li, Sm)TiO3 (CLST) ceramic and PTFE, and the dispersion of the ceramic particles in the matrix. FTIR, XPS and TEM results indicate that TEOS is coated on the ceramic particles successfully and forms a silica coating layer. The surface modification improves the dispersion of particles in PTFE and interface contact between the ceramic fillers and PTFE matrix. These improve the thermal stability and reduce the dielectric loss of the dielectric composites. The CLST/PTFE composite modified by TEOS exhibits a dielectric constant of 6.22 with dielectric loss just 0.0012 at microwave frequencies (around 10 GHz).

The microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of 0.13% C-5.4% Mn low-carbon cold-rolled medium manganese steel in different annealing temperatures as well as different annealing times were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope and X-Ray Diffraction. The results indicated that the main microstructure after annealing was ultra-fine grained ferrite, austenite and martensite. Annealing temperature of the two-phase region was between 625 degrees C and 700 degrees C; the highest content of austenite was 20.23% at 675 degrees C. The annealed time increased from 10 min to 2 h. With the extension of annealing time, the austenite volume fraction decreased first and then increased, which was 20.20% and 20.23% at 10 min and 2 h, respectively. The optimum comprehensive mechanical properties were obtained at 675 degrees C for 2 h. The tensile strength was 900 MPa, the elongation was 25%, and the tensile strength and elongation reached 22.4 GPa%.

During the application of FRP, the variations of electrochemical parameters, such as corrosion current density and charge transfer resistance, have a significant effect on the understanding of anti-corrosion protection mechanism of FRP. Therefore, this study conducted the electrochemical measurements of corroded reinforced concrete wrapped with FRP. The considered variables included pre-corrosion degrees (1%, 3%, and 6% theoretical mass losses) and anti-corrosion protection methods (non-protection, carbon FRP wrapping, glass FRP wrapping, and epoxy coating). The measurements included half-cell potential, linear polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). By analyzing the variation of the above electrochemical parameters in the whole exposure period, it was concluded that FRP wrapping cannot stop the elicited corrosion response but were effective to reduce the corrosion rates, and the main contributor was the epoxy used as an adhesive between concrete and FRP. Moreover, clear inductive loops were observed in Nyquist plots. According to the fitting results, the inductance values were significantly larger for FRP wrapped specimens and less corroded specimens. The inductance may be owing to the difficulties for diffusion of corrosion products.

In this study, strain P. aeruginosa YM4 was selected for its capacity to efficiently produce di-rhamnolipid (Rha-Rha-C-10-C-10) as the predominant component with soybean oil and glycerol as carbon source, accounting for 64.8% and 85.7% of total products, respectively. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of rhamnolipid products varies with the content of di-rhamnolipid, whereby lower CMC values corresponding to higher di-rhamnolipid contents. The rhamnolipids containing 85.7% di-rhamnolipid had the lowest CMC value of 50 mg/L. Accordingly the viscosity-reducing efficiency and oil-washing efficiency of rhamnolipids increased with higher di-rhamnolipid component. At a concentration of 500 mg/L, the rhamnolipids containing 85.7% di-rhamnolipid worked best and showed 82.5% oil-washing efficiency, which offered great promise for applications in enhanced oil recovery. The results showed the variation of structure and composition of rhamnolipids had a significant effect on their application.

Metal-Organic Frameworks derived novel hierarchical durian-like nickel sulfide (NiS2) as an anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries	MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article						Nanoparticles; NiS2; Sodium ion batteries; Energy storage and conversion	ELECTRODE MATERIALS; COMPOSITE	An anode material for sodium-ion batteries, Ni-Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)-derived nickel sulfide (NiS2), is first reported. The synthesis strategy involves a novel method in which Ni-based MOFs is fabricated as precursor and then sulfured by sublimed sulfur in solid phase reaction. The as synthesized Ni-MOFs-derived NiS2 shows a hierarchical durian-like nanostructure made of nanoparticles with the diameter of around 10 nm and amorphous carbon with 3 dimensional conductive net skeleton. Moreover, due to the novel hierarchical nanostructure, sodium ions are able to easily insert/extract into/from the active material. As a result, the as synthesized Ni-MOF-derived NiS2 nanostructure electrode exhibits high specific capacity and excellent rate performance. We believe that the hierarchical Ni-MOFs-derived NiS2 nanoparticles will be one of the most promising electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

And then, the effect of modified hydrotalcite on the flame retardancy and smoke suppression properties of flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) has been investigated using limiting oxygen index (LOI) method, cone calorimeter test (CONE), smoke density chamber, flue gas analyzer, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The current indicated that the LOI of flame-retardant modified FPUF was increased to 25.4%. And the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR) of the samples were decreased by 74.9 kW/m(2) and by 9.7 MJ/m(2), respectively. Additionally, the total amount of flue gas produced by combustion was reduced by 157.7 m(2)/m(2), and the maximum concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) gas decreased from 51.3 to 23.8 mg/m(3). Based on these data, it can be found that the hydrotalcite modified by dihydrogen phosphate intercalation had an excellent flame-retardant and smoke-suppressant effect, and 15% of modified hydrotalcite was the most appropriate amount during the combustion process of the modified FPUFs.

In this work, the shuttle plasmid pHA01 was constructed and the sucrose isomerase (Slase) was expressed in Bacillus subtilis WB800. The optimal nitrogen and carbon sources for Slase expression were yeast extract (15 g/L) and un-pretreated cane molasses (UCM, 20 g/L), respectively. After the UCM fed, the whole cell activity reached 5.2 U/mL in a 7.5 L fermentor. Optimum catalytic temperature and pH of whole cell were 35 degrees C and 5.5, respectively. Although the biologic membrane reactor (BMR) system consecutively worked for 12 batches, the sucrose conversion remained higher than 90%, indicating the BMR system had a greater operational stability.

Compatibility between the two components was enhanced by modifying NR with a coupling agent, gamma-(2,3-epoxypropoxy) propyltrimethoxysilane (KH560). SI with silanol groups was synthesized by the hydrolysis of phenyltrimethoxysilane and dimethyldimethoxysilane. Different amount of SI was blended with modified NR, and the corresponding yellow transparent samples were obtained and used for the subsequent curing and microscopic observation. SI-rich nanoparticles were found to be evenly dispersed in the initial sample and further coarsened to nano- and micro-particles. The size and amount of the particles increased with the SI loading. The morphology evolution mechanism was discussed based on microscopic observation and chemical reaction processes. Thermal stability of the cured hybrids was characterized by thermalgravimetric analysis. Temperatures at 5% and 10% mass loss and residual weight at 900 degrees C were found to increase with the SI loading. Furthermore, carbon retention after high temperature oxidation was also increased. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was also successfully used in the catalytic hydroconversion (CHC) of coal-related model compound oxybis (methylene) dibenzene (OBMDB) and an extract (E) from Piliqing subbituminous coal (PSBC) in n-hexane. As a result, OBMDB was completely converted to methylcyclohexane by the CHC under 3 MPa of initial hydrogen pressure at 240 degrees C for 2 h. Ni-Mg2Si/AP can activate H-2 to biatomic active hydrogen (H (horizontal ellipsis) H) and split H-2 to immobile H+ attached on the Ni-Mg2Si/AP surface and relatively mobile H-. Then the bridged linkage (BL) in OBMDB can be cleaved by H- attack on a alpha-carbon atom in OBMDB, producing toluene and benzyloxy anion, which abstracts H+ from the Ni-Mg2Si/AP surface to afford phenylmethanol (PM). The alpha-carbon in PM is attacked by H- to generate toluene and HO-. H (horizontal ellipsis) H transfers to benzene ring in toluene yields methylcyclohexane. The soluble portion (SP) from the CHC (SPE-CHC) and non-CHC (NCHC) (SPE-NCHC) of E were analyzed with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Non-substituted cycloalkanes (NSCAs) are predominant in the SPE-CHC, accounting for 66.9 % of the total group components, and interestingly 65.3 % of NSCAs is cyclohexane, while non-substituted arenes are the most abundant in the SPE-NCHC. The results indicate that the CHC is beneficial to the fracture of COCBB and hydrogenation of ARs to produce more NSCAs.

In addition, the interfacial strength between the active material and flexible substrate should be optimized for high-performance LIBs. Herein, cotton cloth (CC) is employed as a flexible substrate, and electroless plating is utilized to deposit a layer of Cu nanoparticles, which enhances the conductivity of CC and acts as a precursor for the active material, i.e., CuO. The results reveal that the in situ etching and subsequent heat treatment converted Cu film into CuO nanowires on CC substrate. Moreover, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are introduced to enhance the connectivity of CuO nanowires. Consequently, the CuO/CNT/CC electrode rendered a high areal capacity of > 700 mu Ah center dot cm(-2)after 100 charge/discharge cycles as well as excellent rate capability. The current work presents a novel route to develop desirable substrates for next-generation flexible Li-ion batteries.

This report describes a deficiency in N utilization in an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transfer DNA insertion mutant of the mitochondrial folylpolyglutamate synthetase gene DFC, which catalyzes the conjugation of glutamate residues to the tetrahydrofolate during folate synthesis. The mutant seedlings displayed several metabolic changes that are typical of plant responses to low-N stress, including increased levels of starch and anthocyanin synthesis as well as decreased levels of soluble protein and free amino acid, as compared with those in wild-type seedlings when external N was sufficient. More striking changes were observed when dfc seedlings were grown under N-limited conditions, including shorter primary roots, fewer lateral roots, higher levels of glycine and carbon-N ratios, and lower N content than those in wild-type seedlings. Gene expression studies in mutant seedlings revealed altered transcript levels of several genes involved in folate biosynthesis and N metabolism. The biochemical and metabolic changes also suggested that N assimilation is drastically perturbed due to a loss of DFC function. The observation that elevated CO2 partly rescued the dfc phenotypes suggests that the alterations in N metabolism in dfc may be mainly due to a defect in photorespiration. These results indicate that DFC is required for N utilization in Arabidopsis and provide new insight into a potential interaction between folate and N metabolism.

The catalytic rates for medium-pore zeolite H-ZSM-5 were not only a larger than for H-beta, but also selective for 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol during formaldehyde condensation with isobutene. Isoprene forms, under the optimal reaction conditions, either in a second dehydration step of the unsaturated alcohol, or in a single step over H-ZSM-5 with optimal Si/Al ratio (Si/Al = 40). Mechanistic studies revealed that sequential Prins cyclization and hetero-Diels-Alder reactions of the desired products, forming six carbon species, occur only at slow rates over H-ZSM-5. Using DFT methods it was determined that the reaction follows a two-step mechanism: protonation of formaldehyde and electrophilic attack to the alkene, and deprotonation of the resulting intermediate carbocation. For isobutene and 1-butene, the electrophilic addition is coordinated with the protonation of the formyl group, but for cis-2-butene, it is coordinated with the proton back-donation step. The rate-limiting step switches from electrophilic addition for isobutene to proton elimination for the other two C4 isomers.

The combustion characteristics of iron parti-cles are of great significance for developing iron combustion model, designing efficient combustor, and optimizing combustion technologies. In this work, the micro-explosion behavior of burning iron particles was experimentally investigated based on optical diagnostics. With two high-speed cameras operating at 10,0 0 0 frames per second, the three-dimensional (3D) motion and mean surface temperature of burning iron particles during the micro-explosion process were measured using the stereo imaging technique and two-color pyrometry, respectively. The probability of micro-explosions in different oxidizing environments were statistically studied. Three distinct micro-explosion modes have been observed. The results showed that the micro-explosion of burning iron particles heavily depended on oxygen concentration. The micro-explosion would slightly reduce the particle surface temperature by 30-70 K within 0.5 ms, since a lot of smaller fragments were produced. In addition, the 3D velocity of most fragments would sharply increase to 2-6 times within 0.2 ms after the micro-explosion occurred. Regarding the mechanism of the micro-explosion, three types of potential gas sources inside the particle were discussed. The sharp gradients of gas temperature and oxygen concentration may facilitate the rapid increase of the internal pressure in the particle, which eventually causes the micro-explosion.(c) 2021 The Combustion Institute.

A new flow stress model, which could predict the flow behavior of the tested steels at different tempering temperatures more efficiently, was established. The relationship between mobile dislocation density and strain hardening exponent was discussed based on the dislocation-stress relation. Arrhenius equation and an inverse proportional function were adopted to describe the mobile dislocation, and two mathematical models were established to describe the relationship between tempering temperature and strain hardening exponent. Nonlinear regression analysis was applied to the Arrhenius type model, hence, the activation energy was determined to he 37. 6 kJ/mol. Moreover, the square of correlation coefficient was 0.985, which indicated a high reliability between the fitted curve and experimental data. By comparison with the Arrhenius type curve, the general trend of the inverse proportional fitting curve was coincided with the experimental data points except of some fitting errors. Thus, the Arrhenius type model can he adopted to predict the strain hardening exponent at different tempering temperatures.

The overwhelming focus in the search for catalysing agents has been on compounds containing titanium, but the precise mechanism of their actions remains somewhat obscure. A recent experiment has now shown that fullerenes (C-60) can also act as catalysts for both hydrogen uptake and release in lithium borohydride (LiBH4). In an effort to understand the involved mechanism, we have employed density functional theory to carry out a detailed study of the interaction between this complex metal hydride and the carbon nanomaterial. Considering a stepwise reduction of the hydrogen content in LiBH4, we find that the presence of C-60 can lead to a substantial reduction of the involved H-removal energies. This effect is explained as a consequence of the interaction between the BHx- complex and the C-60 entity.	[Scheicher, Ralph H.; Araujo, C.

In order to shed light on the mechanism of oxygen reduction reaction on SnO2, the activation of the oxygen atom and molecule on undoped and Pt-doped SnO2 was investigated using the first-principles method in this study. We found that: (a) the Pt dopants in the SnO2(110) surfaces are positively charged; (b) the O-vacancy sites are the most preferable for the adsorption of molecular oxygen; (c) O- species, the most reactive form of oxygen, are easy to be formed through the activation of molecular oxygen on the O-defect sites of the Pt-doped SnO2 surface; and (d) the synergetic effects of Pt dopant and O-vacancy would be the key to the O-2 activation. The current results shed light on the activation mechanism of oxygen species on undoped and Pt-doped SnO2 supports.

Optical properties and radiative forcing of urban aerosols in Nanjing, China	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aerosols; Optical depth; Single scattering albedo; Angstrom exponent; Radiative forcing; Nanjing	BLACK CARBON; RAMS-CMAQ; ABSORPTION; SATELLITE	Continuous measurements of atmospheric aerosols were made in Nanjing, a megacity in China, from 18 January to 18 April, 2011 (Phase 1) and from 22 April 2011 to 21 April 2012 (Phase 2). Aerosol characteristics, optical properties, and direct radiative forcing (DRF) were studied through interpretations of these measurements. We found that during Phase 1, mean PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and aerosol scattering coefficient (Bsp) in Nanjing were 76.1 +/- 59.3 mu g m(-3), 4.1 +/- 2.2 mu g m(-3), and 170.9 +/- 105.8 M m(-1), respectively. High pollution episodes occurred during Spring and Lantern Festivals when hourly PM2.5 concentrations reached 440 mu g m(-3), possibly due to significant discharge of fireworks. Temporal variations of PM2.5, BC, and Bsp were similar to each other. It is estimated that inorganic scattering aerosols account for about 49 +/- 8.6% of total aerosols while BC only accounted for 6.6 +/- 2.9%, and nitrate was larger than sulfate. In Phase 2, optical properties of aerosols show great seasonality. High relative humidity (RH) in summer (June, July, August) likely attributed to large optical depth (AOD) and small Angstrom exponent (AE) of aerosols. Due to dust storms, AE of total aerosols was the smallest in spring (March, April, May). Annual mean 550-nm AOD and 675/440-nm AE were 0.6 +/- 03 and 1.25 +/- 0.29 for total aerosols, 0.04 +/- 0.02 and 1.44 +/- 0.50 for absorbing aerosols, 0.48 +/- 0.29 and 1.64 +/- 0.29 for fine aerosols, respectively. Annual single scattering albedo of aerosols ranged from 0.90 to 0.92. Real time wavelength-dependent surface albedo from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used to assess aerosol DRFs. Both total and absorbing aerosol DRFs had significant seasonal variations in Nanjing and they were the strongest in summer. Annual mean clear sky TOA DRF (including daytime and nighttime) of total and absorbing aerosols was about -6.9 and +4.5 W m(-2), respectively. Aerosol DRFs were found to be sensitive to surface albedo. Over brighter surfaces, solar radiation was more absorbed by absorbing aerosols and less scattered by scattering aerosols.

However, detailed water relations, gas exchange characteristics of fan bryophytes and their adaptations to particular microhabitats remain poorly understood. In this study, we measured and analyzed microclimatic data, as well as water release curves, pressure-volume relationships and photosynthetic water and light response curves for three common fan bryophytes in an Asian subtropical montane cloud forest (SMCF). Results demonstrate high relative humidity but low light levels and temperatures in the understory, and a strong effect of fog on water availability for bryophytes in the SMCF. The facts that fan bryophytes in dry air lose most of their free water within 1 h, and a strong dependence of net photosynthesis rates on water content, imply that the transition from a hydrated, photosynthetically active state to a dry, inactive state is rapid. In addition, fan bryophytes developed relatively high cell wall elasticity and the osmoregulatory capacity to tolerate desiccation. These fan bryophytes had low light saturation and compensation point of photosynthesis, indicating shade tolerance. It is likely that fan bryophytes can flourish on tree trunks in the SMCF because of substantial annual precipitation, average relative humidity, and frequent and persistent fog, which can provide continual water sources for them to intercept. Nevertheless, the low water retention capacity and strong dependence of net photosynthesis on water content of fan bryophytes indicate a high risk of unbalanced carbon budget if the frequency and severity of drought increase in the future as predicted.

J	Cai, WR; Liu, PJ; Bai, SB; Li, S				Cai, Wenrui; Liu, Pengju; Bai, Shibing; Li, Sai			A one-step method to manufacture biodegradable poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) bead foam parts	POLYMERS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						bead foaming; mechanical properties; PBAT; PLA; supercritical CO2		Pollution caused by waste plastic, particularly from the foam packages, is increasingly worse, and utilizing biodegradable material is considered a promising solution to handle this environmental issue. Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) is a typical environment-friendly polymer due to the recognized biodegradability and excellent mechanical performance. However, there have been very few works preparing PBAT bead foams via the supercritical fluid foaming technology, and the related foaming behavior is still unclear. In this study, we foamed PBAT and PBAT-polylactide (PLA) beads using supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO2) as a foaming agent, and the foaming behaviors of beads as well as the mechanical properties of bead foam parts manufactured by one-step foaming method were systematically investigated. The incorporation of PLA enhanced the mechanical properties of the composition. At the optimal foaming conditions, the expansion ratio and cell density of PBAT/PLA foam were 13.44 and 4.08 x 10(8) cells/cm(3), respectively. Benefitting from the uniform cell structure, the bead foam part showed excellent resilience and elasticity with adhesive strength of 0.57 MPa and compression strength of 1.05 MPa. Meanwhile, PBAT and PBAT-PLA foam parts had high surface quality and good interbead sintering properties. PBAT can be a promising substitute for traditional non-polymer foams for packaging, household, and automobile fields.

Here we developed a lambda (lambda) Red recombinase system and antisense RNA technology in K. pneumoniae to reshape glycerol metabolism pathways. We deleted the lactate dehydrogenase gene ldh through RecA-dependent recombination to block lactic acid synthesis. Next, the 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase gene dhaT was replaced by an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (aldH from E. coli) to repress 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) synthesis and simultaneously convert 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) to 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP). Specially, we developed a Red recombinase system in K. pneumoniae, by which the enzymes related to glycerol metabolism were mutated by transformed oligos. One positive strain produced 6.39 g L-1 3-HP and 32.6 g L-1 1,3-PDO at 36 h without using any antibiotics and inducers. Sequencing results showed that the mutation occurred mainly in byproduct pathways. Finally, antisense RNA technique was applied to block the synthesis of lactic acid and acetic acid. We found that the increase of 3-HP was approximately proportional to the decrease of lactic acid and acetic acid, indicating their competition for glycerol carbon flux.

The desorption isotherms of low-rank coal mainly belongs to Type B, which are primarily caused by ink-bottle-shaped and narrow-slit pores that are good for coalbed methane (CBM) enrichment, but bad for seepage. The seepage pores are dominated by primary plant macropores (>1000 nm), with a poor development of mesopores (100-1000 nm). The fractal features of adsorbed pores and seepage pores were defined and calculated using fractal dimensions D-2 (2.563-2.926) and D-4 (2.683-3.263), respectively. D-2 has a positive correlation with moisture content, while D-4 has a positive correlation with Ro and fixed carbon and a negative correlation with the volatile content. Both D-2 and D-4 have a weaker association with the ash yield and no apparent relationship with coal macerals, indicating that coal-forming materials and environments have little influence on the pore structure fractal characteristics. D-2 has a strongly correlation with the BET surface area (R-2 = 0.9026) and the average pore diameter (R-2 = 0.9841), again proving that D-2 can be used to characterize the pore structure fractal dimension of adsorbed pores. D-2 shows a negative correlation with the Langmuir volume (VI), but no apparent relationship with the Langmuir pressure (P-L), indicating that the pore structure of absorbed pores has little effect on methane desorption during the process of CBM exploitation. D-4 has weak positive correlation with permeability. Overall, fractal analysis is beneficial for better understanding the pore structure, methane adsorbability and seepage ability of low-rank coal.

In many cases, retrofitting the damaged structure is more economical and more sustainable than reconstructing the entire structure. A progressive collapse test of a 1/3 scale, four-bay by two-story reinforced concrete (RC) frame was conducted, after which the structure was retrofitted with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) wraps and retested. The center column in the first story was removed and the frame was pushed down quasistatically under displacement control to investigate the progressive collapse performances of the retrofitted RC frame. The test results were represented systematically at different areas in terms of the resistance forces, crack developments, and local and global failure modes. Numerical models were built to verify the test frame before and after the retrofitting. A design method was proposed to retrofit an RC frame using CFRP wraps after a progressive collapse. The test frame was redesigned to improve the retrofitting and used as an example to demonstrate the rationality of the proposed retrofit design method. The results indicated that the proposed retrofitting technology rapidly restored the frame structure to its original capacity before the progressive collapse occurred, whilst consistently satisfying the priorities of being economical and sustainable.

Ultra-high thermoelectric performance in SnTe by the integration of several optimization strategies	MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS			English	Article						SnTe; Thermoelectric performance; Multi-nanostructure doping	THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; BAND-STRUCTURE; ENHANCEMENT; SCATTERING; GETE; PBTE; EFFICIENCY; IMPROVE	Using nanostructures to improve the performance of bulk thermoelectric materials is a very effective and prevailing method. The integration of several optimization strategies into a single thermoelectric material using multi-nanostructure doping can optimize the properties at multiple levels. In this work, we use the combination of the energy filtering effect and conductive channels to greatly optimize the thermoelectric performance of SnTe. Specifically, we first incorporated Mg3.2Sb0.6Bi1.4 alloy nanoparticles into Sn1.03Te. As an n-type semiconductor, Mg3.2Sb0.6Bi1.4 can not only effectively neutralize the excessive hole in p-type SnTe, but also generate energy filtering effect due to the P-N junction barrier. Thus, the electronic thermal conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient are optimized. Then, the conductive channel constructed by doping multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was used to further improve the thermoelectric properties of SnTe. When carriers are transported in the conductive channel, the interference of lattice structure and other factors can be effectively reduced so that the mobility of carriers can be further improved. In addition, we introduce Bi elemental elements to enhance the high frequency phonon scattering based on the existing optimization. As a result of this synergistic effect, an ultralow k(tot) similar to 0.96 W m(-1)K(-1) and a high ZT similar to 1.56 are obtained at 873 K in SnBi0.03Te-1% Mg3.2Sb0.6Bi1.4-0.2% MWCNTs.

In this study, we used Typha angustifolia (T. angustifolia) grown in sterile Hoagland nutrient solution to determine the rhizosphere effects on the ability of bacteria in water to reduce HCB levels. The results revealed that T. angustifolia could facilitate HCB degradation and that the initial HCB concentration was the major factor responsible for HCB degradation in nutrient solution. Furthermore, HCB biodegradation in low-HCB nutrient solution with T. angustifolia fitted the first-order kinetics, owing to the high concentration of total organic carbon, low HCB toxicity, and unique bacterial community in the T. angustifolia rhizosphere. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that the rhizosphere effects and different dosages of HCB have significant effects on the bacterial communities by repressing and favoring certain populations. The most successful bacteria to adapt to HCB contamination was Bacillus sp., while the dominant bacterial phyla in HCB-polluted water were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.

AFTMs are particularly suitable for humid flue gases, as water vapor enhances the facilitated transportation of CO2. However, there is a lack of mathematical models available to evaluate the impact of water vapor on CO(2)separation performance for large-scale membrane modules. Therefore, developing a mathematical model considering the water vapor effects is of great importance to guide the large-scale applications of AFTMs for CO(2)capture. In this study, a mathematical model using tanks-in-series approach for CO(2)capture through AFTMs is proposed. In this model, the tanks-in-series approach can reflect the variable (water vapor-dependent) gas permeance along the membrane module. Modeling results showed the necessity of considering the effect of water vapor content decline along the module. In addition, both increasing temperature and pressure primarily lead to a faster decline of relative humidity (RH) along the membrane module, resulting in an increase of CO(2)recovery but a decrease of CO(2)product purity. For a gas stream with relatively low water vapor content (<2% in this study), different H2O permeance has a minor effect on separation performance. Moreover, permeate gas with higher water vapor content as well as higher RH is considered more suitable for further treatment of second stage membrane separation. In conclusion, the proposed model provides insights for comprehensive parameter analysis of membrane CO(2)capture simulation and could support the development of large-scale AFTMs separation applications, particularly for systems design and more accurate performance estimation.

By designing the preparation process, biomaterials could be adjusted to confer the desired properties. This study showed that the pH value of modified C3S by carbonization (signed as C-C3S) notably reduced from 11.2 to 8.15 with adjusting the carbonization process. Meanwhile, C-C3S displayed a suitable setting time (from 9.49 +/- 0.19 to 11.20 +/- 0.18 min). In addition, its compressive strength can reach about 10.61 MPa, which is comparable to that of cancellous bone. Carbonation time was confirmed to be a key factor in the formation of calcite by using carbon dioxide modified hydrolyzed tricalcium silicate. The results of cell activity and proliferation suggested that the C-C3S had improved osteogenic activity. Therefore, personalized design and customization of biomaterials can be realized by adjusting carbonization processes according to clinical requirements for bone cement. C-C3S may be a promising material for bone repair.

Glycerol is an inexpensive and renewable resource for fuels and chemicals production and is available as a byproduct of biodiesel production. Gluconate is a more oxidized substrate than glucose, whereas glycerol is a more reduced substrate than glucose. Although the production of homoethanol from glucose can be achieved, the conversion of gluconate to ethanol is accompanied by the production of oxidized byproduct such as acetate, and reduced byproducts such as 1,3-propanediol are produced, along with ethanol, when glycerol is used as the carbon source. When gluconate and glycerol are used as the sole carbon source by Klebsiella oxytoca BW21, the ethanol yield is about 62 to 64%. Coutilization of both gluconate and glycerol in batch fermentation increased the yield of ethanol to about 78.7% and decreased by-product accumulation (such as acetate and 1,3-propanediol) substantially. Decreasing by-product formation by deleting the pta, frd, ldh, pflA and pduC genes in strain BW21 increased the ethanol yield to 89.3% in the batch fermentation of a glycerol-gluconate mixture. These deletions produced the strain K. oxytoca WT26. However, the utilization rate of glycerol was significantly slower than that of gluconate in batch fermentation. In addition, substantial amounts of glycerol remain unutilized after gluconate was depleted in batch fermentation. Continuous fed-batch fermentation was used to solve the utilization rate mismatch problem for gluconate and glycerol. An ethanol yield of 97.2% was achieved in continuous fed-batch fermentation of these two substrates, and glycerol was completely used at the end of the fermentation. IMPORTANCE Gluconate is a biomass-derived degradation product, and glycerol can be obtained as a biodiesel byproduct. Compared to glucose, using them as the sole substrate is accompanied by the production of by-products. Our study shows that through pathway engineering and adoption of a fed-batch culture system, high-yield homoethanol production that usually can be achieved by using glucose as the substrate is achievable using gluconate and glycerol as cosubstrates. The same strategy is expected to be able to achieve homofermentative production of other products, such as lactate and 2,3-butanediol, which can be typically achieved using glucose as the substrate and inexpensive biodiesel-derived glycerol and biomass-derived gluconate as the cosubstrates.

In this paper, plain-woven carbon fiber fabric reinforced polyether ether ketone (CFF/PEEK) thermoplastic composites are fabricated by hot-pressing process. Influence of the critical process parameters, including molding temperature, molding pressure and holding time, on mechanical properties of CFF/PEEK composites are investigated. The tensile, flexural and short-beam shear properties of CFF/PEEK composites fabricated by different process parameters were tested as evaluation indicators to achieve the optimization of process parameters. Most importantly, to deeply and systematically reveal the influence mechanism of process parameters, the high-temperature contact angle of CFF-PEEK and the viscosity-temperature characteristics of PEEK were observed and analyzed. In addition, the forming quality and microscopic failure modes of CFF/PEEK composites were observed by optical, metallographic and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. This work provides a research idea and technical route for studying the process parameters of fiber reinforced polymer composites and revealing their influence mechanism on mechanical properties.

For the first time, the impact of different dissociation species (cationic, zwitterionic and anionic forms) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on its photocatalytic transformation fate was systematically studied in a UVA/LED/TiO2 system. The dissociation forms of CIP at different pH affected the photocatalytic degradation kinetics, transformation products (TPs) formation as well as degradation pathways. Zwitterionic form of CIP exhibited the highest degradation rate constant (0.2217 +/- 0.0179 min(-1)), removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) and release of fluoride ion (F-). Time-dependent evolution profiles on TPs revealed that the cationic and anionic forms of CIP mainly underwent piperazine ring dealkylation, while zwitterionic CIP primarily proceeded through defluorination and piperazine ring oxidation. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculation based on Fukui index well interpreted the active sites of different CIP species. Potential energy surface (PES) analysis further elucidated the reaction transition state (TS) evolution and energy barrier (Lambda E-b) for CIP with different dissociation species after radical attack. This study provides deep insights into degradation mechanisms of emerging organic contaminants in advanced oxidation processes associated to their chemical speciation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of typical cutting parameters including laser power, cutting speed, and assist gas pressure on laser cutting quality of different type of workpiece materials was investigated. A full factorial experimental array was employed involving 24 trials. The statistical significance of individual cutting parameters was determined using main effects plot together with ANOVA. Results showed that the fiber laser was feasible for cutting CFRP with very high efficiency. The HAZ level of laser cutting CFRP was highly related to fiber orientation, laser power, and cutting speed based on theoretical and statistical analysis. Thermal model was built to simulate HAZ values recorded on the exit surface. The calculated results were close (within 60m) to the experimental results. The lowest HAZ value of 707m and surface roughness of 2.43-m surface roughness were achieved in cutting Type 1 (+45 degrees/-45 degrees) configuration. High-resolution SEM and optical micrographs showed that cracks, cavities, delamination, and matrix decomposition were the typical defects observed in CW fiber laser cutting of CFRP laminates.

Its chemical structure was well characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, C-13 and P-31 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and elemental analysis tests. PDMPP was incorporated into polypropylene (PP) matrix, and the fire-retardant performance, thermal properties, and water resistance of PP composites were investigated in detail. PP/23 wt% PDMPP composites before and after water resistance tests both achieved UL-94V-0 grade during vertical burning tests, and the limiting oxygen index was slightly declined from 26.7% to 26.3%. Small amount of PDMPP was extracted by hot water, and the weight loss percentage was 0.67% during water resistance tests. The piperazine and triazine rings in PDMPP contributed to a much better char-forming capability, and then a greatly expanded and coherent char residue was generated during combustion and exhibited excellent isolation effect. The heat release rate, carbon monoxide production, and smoke production rate of the flame-retarded PP composites before and after water resistance tests were effectively suppressed to a low level. Consequently, the introduction of PDMPP apparently improved the fire safety of PP composites as well as excellent water-resistant performance.

How plants respond to the projected N deposition on the alpine steppe is still in debate. In this study, to investigate the effects of N deposition on the plant community of the alpine steppe, we simulated N deposition at six different N addition rate levels (0, 8, 24, 40, 56, 72 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) from 2015 to 2019. Species composition and diversity were investigated as the assessment indices. The results showed that the importance value of grasses significantly increased with the increase of the N addition rate, while that of forbs significantly decreased. A high N addition rate (72 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) induced species composition change, making Leymus secalinus become the most dominant species within the entire plant community. Compared with the control (without N addition), species richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity, Simpson dominance and Pielou Evenness were significantly reduced under a high N addition rate. The changes of plant diversity in the alpine steppe were closely correlated with dynamics of soil nutrients, especially total carbon (TC), total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). Our findings suggested that a high N deposition rate (72 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) could significantly change plant composition and reduce the diversity of the alpine steppe, though they were less affected by low N deposition rates at present. With the increase of the N deposition rate, plant composition and diversity of the alpine steppe may be negatively affected in the future. In addition, Leymus secalinus is more competitive than other species with an N deposition rate increase. Soil C, soil P and soil NH4-N variation induced by N deposition might play a key role in regulating changes in plant composition and diversity in the alpine steppe. In addition, longer term field investigation needs to be carried out to testify to this phenomenon with the increase of N deposition in the future.

In this study, shielding performances of 2024 aluminum alloy panel, carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite (CFRP) panel and their hybrid laminates with different stacking configurations were investigated by ballistic tests of the materials impacted by Mylar flyer at 9.0 km/s. The results are supposed to guide the design of shielding laminate panel. It was found that the stacking combination of CFRP and aluminum alloy significantly reduced the peak shock pressure induced by hypervelocity impact, and the increase of the layer number enhanced the shielding performance of the hybrid laminate. The five-layered aluminum alloy/CFRP laminates resisted the impact of the flyer without perforation. Furthermore, the extent of the damage of an impacted laminate was related to the velocity profile on its free surface. The planar plate impact testing employing a Doppler laser velocity interferometer is a feasible approach to quantitatively evaluate the shielding performance of structural material.

However, facile fabrication of long-life and high-rate cathode materials for LIBs is required to facilitate practical application. Here we report a favourable way to synthesize a Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C nanosphere cathode with three-dimensional (3D) continuous electron pathways by synergistically utilizing polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and acetylene black for carbon coating and conductive network construction. The as-prepared cathode material has a discharge capacity of 142 mA h g(-1) at 1 C rate, approaching its theoretical value (150 mA h g(-1)), and can even be cycled at a rate as high as 30 C without capacity fading. After 1000 cycles at a rate of 5 C, the as-prepared material has a capacity retention of up to 83%, and can also tolerate 5000 cycles with a considerable capacity, demonstrating excellent cycling stability. Our work shows that this material has great potential for high-energy and high-power energy storage applications, and this rational method can be applied to synthesize high-performance cathode materials on a large scale.

The unique, carbocationic reaction mechanism of these enzymes can form multiple products from a single prenyl diphosphate substrate. Two maize genes were isolated that encode very similar sesquiterpene synthases, TPS6 and TPS11, which both produce beta-bisabolene, a common monocyclic sesquiterpene, and beta-macrocarpene, an uncommon bicyclic olefin. Investigation of the reaction mechanism showed that the formation of beta-macrocarpene proceeds via a neutral beta-bisabolene intermediate and requires reprotonation by a proton that may ultimately be abstracted from water. This reprotonation is dependent on the pH and the presence of a Mg2+ cofactor. Mutational analysis of the enzyme demonstrated that a highly conserved tyrosine residue in the active center of the enzymes is important for the protonation process. TPS6 and TPS11 are transcribed both in leaves and roots of maize, but the respective terpene products were only detected in roots. The expression in roots was up-regulated by herbivore damage to the leaves, suggesting a long distance signal transduction cascade between leaves and roots.

Herein, we reported the construction of a series of pH-sensitive micelles by conjugating the hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) segment to a hydrophobic farnesylthiosalicylate derivative, FTS-hydrazide (FTS-H), with a hydrazone linker, whose cleavability can be conveniently modulated by choosing various lengths of the carbon chain or appropriate electron-withdrawing groups with different steric environment around the hydrazone linker. We examined the hydrolysis rates of these pH-sensitive micelles in both neutral and acidic conditions. One of the pH-sensitive micelles (PHF-2) was found to be highly sensitive to acidic conditions while being fairly stable in neutral conditions. Furthermore, PHF-2 micelles well retained the antitumor activity of free FTS-H. We further evaluated the use of PHF-2 micelles as a carrier for delivering paclitaxel (PTX) and the triggered release of PTX under the acidic environment. PTX-loaded PHF-2 micelles showed enhanced antitumor activity compared with free PTX, likely because of the combinational effect between PHF-2 micelles and loaded PTX.

The MFA showed that lipase production was dependent on, and coupled to the tributyrin uptake rate, formation of biomass, lactate, ATP, as well as amino acids from the aspartate and glutamate family. Using tributyrin as the sole carbon source, an adaptive evolution strategy was applied to increase the tributyrin uptake rate. B. subtilis SPZ1 was obtained from CICC 20034 by adaptive evolution over 1000 generations of growth-based selection. The tributyrin consumption rate of strain SPZ1 reached 0.89 g/(L center dot h) which was 1.9-fold higher than that of the original strain. The MFA indicated that the 212% increase of tributyrin uptake flux contributed to the 556% increase of lipase flux. Consequently, the lipase activity (0.65 U/mL) of strain SPZ1 was 1.9-fold higher than that of the original strain. This was the highest lipase activity obtained by fermentation in synthetic medium reported for Bacillus strains. In complex culture medium, lipase activity of SPZ1 reached 3.3 U/mL.

The physical and structural properties and the adsorption mechanism of kerogen are difficult to be analyzed comprehensively by experiments. Molecular simulation provides technical support to the investigation of the adsorption and enrichment mechanisms of shale gas at molecular level. Using the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and Molecular Dynamic (MD) methods, type III kerogen model was constructed, and the adsorption behaviors of methane were investigated. The effects of temperature and gas composition on shale gas adsorption, and the adsorption selectivity of mixed gas C2H6/CH4 and the radial distribution function (RDF) were also discussed. The results show that the adsorption capacity of C2H6 decreases with the increase of temperature and pressure. The adsorption capacity of C2H6 increases first, then decreases, and finally tends to be stable. The adsorption experiment and molecular simulation results show that Type III kerogen has a stronger adsorption capacity for C2H6 than CH4. C2H6 in smaller nano-scale pores are more difficult to desorption under the lower pressure. The carbon atoms in kerogen interact strongly with the gas molecule of CH4 and C2H6.

Now, an abnormal layered-tunnel heterostructure Na0.44Co0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode material induced by chemical element substitution is reported. By virtue of beneficial synergistic effects, this layered-tunnel electrode shows outstanding electrochemical performance in sodium half-cell system and excellent compatibility with hard carbon anode in sodium full-cell system. The underlying formation process, charge compensation mechanism, phase transition, and sodium-ion storage electrochemistry are clearly articulated and confirmed through combined analyses of in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy as well as operando X-ray diffraction.

Their formation mechanisms were investigated by UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). UV-Vis spectroscopy study showed that [VO(SO4)(H2O)(4)]center dot H2O concentration in H2SO4 solution was proportional to concentrations of VO2+ and SO42-. The increased deviation from the near centrosymmetry of the octahedral complexes is due to the replacement of an equatorial water oxygen in [VO(H2O)(5)]SO4 by a sulfate oxygen in [VO(SO4)(H2O)(4)]center dot H2O. The dimer shows symmetrical structure, which correlates very well with non-activity in UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis. Structural information on both vanadium(IV) species can be confirmed by Raman and XRD measurements of crystals from the supersaturated solution of VOSO4 in 1 M, 6 M and 12 M sulfuric acid. A solution of vanadium(IV) (0.05 M) in 12M H2SO4, in which the vanadium(IV) species is [VO(H2O)(3)](2)(mu-SO4)(2), exhibits a reversible redox behavior near 1.14V (vs. SCE) on the carbon paper electrode.

B	Xu, GH		Liang, S; Li, X; Wang, J		Xu, Guanhua			Leaf Area Index	ADVANCED REMOTE SENSING: TERRESTRIAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter							RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; VEGETATION CANOPIES; REFLECTANCE MODEL; PARAMETERS; SCATTERING; ALGORITHM; INVERSION; PROSPECT	Leaf area index (LAI) indicates the amount of leaf area in an ecosystem. This chapter first introduces field methods for measuring LAI. LAI can also be estimated from remote-sensing data using either statistical or physical methods. The statistical methods use the empirical relationship between the LAI and surface reflectance or vegetation indices. The physical methods determine the LAI based on radiative light transfer processes within the canopy. Various retrieval methods, including neural network methods, genetic algorithms, Bayesian networks, and look-up table methods, are discussed. A real-time LAI estimation method that uses the data assimilation approach is introduced. Some major global moderate-resolution LAI products are illustrated. The global LAI climatology is presented at the end of the chapter. Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical parameter in many land-surface vegetation and climate models that simulate the carbon and water cycles. The vegetation canopy structure, including the LAI, directly influences the radiative transfer process of sunlight in vegetation and, therefore, determines the radiometric characteristics of the top of the canopy (TOC), such as reflectance. Remote-sensing methods estimate the canopy LAI based on its relationship with TOC radiometric information, such as the statistical relationship between the TOC reflectance and the LAI, or from the outputs of physical canopy radiative transfer models. This chapter first introduces definitions of LAI and its measurement methods. The statistical and physical LAI retrieval methods are introduced in Sections 11.2 and 11.3, respectively. Several commonly used retrieval algorithms, such as the neural network algorithms, genetic algorithms, Bayesian networks, and the look-up table (LUT) methods, are described.

The performance of OMBR-MF system was examined employing three different draw solutes (DS), and three model OMPs. The highest forward osmosis (FO) membrane rejection was attained with atenolol (100%) due to its higher molar mass and positive charge. With inorganic DS caffeine (94-100%) revealed highest removal followed by atenolol (89-96%) and atrazine (16-40%) respectively. All three OMPs exhibited higher removal with organic DS as compared to inorganic DS. Significant anoxic removal was observed for atrazine under very different redox conditions with extended anoxic cycle time. This can be linked with possible development of different microbial consortia responsible for diverse enzymes secretion. Overall, the OMBR-MF process showed effective removal of total organic carbon (98%) and nutrients (phosphate 97% and total nitrogen 85%), respectively.

J	Tang, WS; Liu, ZZ; Lu, YY; Li, S				Tang, Wenshui; Liu, Zhenzhen; Lu, Yiyan; Li, Shan			Hybrid confinement mechanism of large-small rupture strain FRP on concrete cylinder	JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hybrid FRP; CFRP; Large rupture strain FRP; Confined concrete	FIBER-REINFORCED POLYMER; ENVIRONMENTAL FATIGUE; AXIAL BEHAVIOR; COMPOSITES; COLUMNS; STRENGTH; GLASS; MODEL; HYBRIDIZATION; PERFORMANCE	This study aims to investigate the hybrid mechanism of concrete cylinders confined with different types of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP). The adoptive FRP sheets include three types of low rupture strain FRPs (carbon fiber polymer (CFRP), glass fiber polymer (GFRP) and basalt fiber polymer (BFRP)) and two types of high rupture strain FRPs (polyethylene terephthalate fiber polymer (PET-FRP) and polyethylene naphthalate fiber polymer (PEN-FRP)). More hybrid gradients are designed to exposit the hybrid mechanism of large-small rupture strain FRPs. A total of 39 FRP-confined concrete cylinders are conducted under axial compression. The tested parameters are FRP types and the number of FRP layers. The failure modes, stress-strain responses, lateral confined pressures under different axial stresses, the apparent Poisson's ratio variation and energy-dissipating capacities are analyzed to reveal the mechanical mechanism of the specimens. The results show that the hybridization of the FRP sheets with rather different elongation capacities brings a pseudo ductility behaviour of concrete cylinders. That definitely improves the strain capacity, but the strength improvement relies on the adequate axial stiffness discrepancy between higher elongation FRP and lower elongation FRP sheets. By the hybridization, the utilization of lower elongation FRP sheets is markedly improved. The concrete cylinders confined by hybrid FRP sheets with similar elongation capacities behave like to the single FRP confined ones. Moreover, the predicted formulas are proposed and capture well the ultimate state of hybrid FRP confined concrete cylinders.

To ensure structural safety, it is critical to develop design codes, which account for uncertainties of materials, the environment, and load, to estimate bond behaviour under long-term exposure to harsh environments. Therefore, a reliability analysis was performed to study the bond behaviour of FRP-concrete interface under wet-dry cycles and sustained loading. Thirty double-lap, shear-bonded carbon FRP (CFRP)-concrete composite specimens were tested after wet-dry cycles and sustained loading exposure. The fracture energy G(f) of the bond behavior between CFRP and concrete was directly obtained from the measured local bond-slip curves. Five widely used test methods were adopted to verify the possible distribution types of G(f). Based on the best fit distribution of G(f), a reliability index beta was then calculated for the specimens. The effects of wet-dry exposure and sustained loading on beta were analysed separately. The effects of the mean and standard deviation of the load on beta were compared. It was found that the mean had a greater impact on reliability than the standard deviation, but neither changed the regulation of the exponential reduction of beta with increasing wet-dry cycle time. Their impact was significant for a small number of wet-dry cycles but insignificant for more than 4000 wet-dry cycles.

Variations in soil properties and herbicide sorption coefficients with depth in relation to PRZM (pesticide root zone model) calculations	GEODERMA			English	Article						2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; Glyphosate; Herbicide sorption coefficients; Soil properties; Landform element; Soil depth; Pesticide root zone model; Sensitivity analyses; Leaching	SPATIAL VARIABILITY; 2,4-D SORPTION; ADSORPTION; TILLAGE; GLYPHOSATE; LANDSCAPE; REDISTRIBUTION; DEGRADATION; TRANSPORT; MOBILITY	There are few experimental data available on how herbicide sorption coefficients change across small increments within soil profiles. Soil profiles were obtained from three landform elements in a strongly-eroded agricultural field and segmented into 2-cm intervals to 0.6 m depth in the knoll (eroded-upper slope), to 1.0 m depth in the toeslope (deposition zone) and to 1.6 m depth in the trough (eroded waterway). Soil samples were analyzed for soil organic carbon content (SOC) (n = 154), soil pH (n = 155), soil carbonate content (n = 126), CEC (n = 126), soil texture (n = 32), bulk density (n = 160), 2,4-D 12,4(dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid] or glyphosate [N-phosphonomethylglycine] sorption by soil (Kd) (n = 90), and 2,4-D or glyphosate sorption per unit soil organic carbon (Koc) (n = 90). Considering all soil profiles, 2.4-D Kd values ranged from 0.12 to 2.61 L kg(-1) and were most strongly influenced by variations in SOC. In contrast, glyphosate Kd values ranged from 19 to 547 L kg(-1) and were predominantly controlled by variations in soil pH and clay content. Two hundred and fifty-two PRZM (pesticide root zone model) version 3.12.2 simulations were also performed. PRZM predicted that glyphosate would be immobile in soils even under an extreme rainfall scenario of 384 mm at one day after herbicide application. In contrast, for 2,4-D, PRZM predicted that up to 6% of the applied herbicide would move to a 15 cm depth under an actual rainfall scenario. PRZM output was particularly sensitive to input values of Kd, relative to input values of soil properties. The greatest change to PRZM outputs occurred when Kd values of toeslope profiles, ranging from 0.16 to 1.77 L kg(-1), were replaced by those measured in knoll profiles, ranging from 0.12 to 0.50 L kg(-1), when the amount of 2,4-D leached to a 15 cm depth increased by 29,081% (from 0.09 to 26.17 g ha-1) under an actual rainfall scenario. We conclude that, when pesticide fate models such as PRZM are being used in policy analyses at larger-scales, data on Kd values in different landform elements and at the soil horizon level could be important for strengthening pesticide leaching predictions.

Its tribological properties were examined using the four-ball test and ball-on-disc tribotester in a wide temperature range and compared with those of oil that contained the additive molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) compound. X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetry were performed to determine the possible mechanism of the antifriction behavior of the lubricants. Results of the four-ball test showed that all of the additives can improve the extreme pressure property of the base oil and decrease the wear scar diameters of low-carbon steel balls. The results of the ball-on-disc test suggested that the MoS2 additive exhibited better lubrication property than the Ba(ReO4)(2) and CaCO3 additives at below 450 degrees C. The CaCO3 additive displayed moderate performance in friction reducing in the high-temperature period. The Ba(ReO4)(2) additive exhibited preferable comprehensive antifriction performance in a wide temperature range because of its intrinsic shear-susceptible property and crystalline change with varied temperatures, which could form a protective layer with some native oxides of the disc sample and thus effectively prevented direct contact between rubbing parts. The detailed friction-reducing mechanism of the three additives is also discussed.

For the oil phase, we used a combustible hydrocarbon (kerosene) with a measured equivalent alkane carbon number of 12. To adjust the balance of affinity with the oil and water phases and their surface activity, pine kraft lignins were carboxymethylated to different degrees, as quantified by (CNMR)-C-13 spectroscopy, potentiometric titrations, and zeta potential measurements. Carboxymethylated lignins (CMLs) with a degree of substitution of 30% displayed a critical aggregation concentration of 3%. The salinity and pH of the aqueous phase were chosen as formulation variables and adjusted within the Winsor framework. The O/W emulsions were produced by following standard protocols. The drop-size distributions of emulsions with varying pH, degree of substitution, and composition (water-to-oil ratio, WOR) were determined, and the long-term stabilities and rheological behavior of these emulsions were analyzed. Most of the obtained O/W fuel emulsions showed shear-thinning behavior with a drop size of approximately 2.5m and were stable for over 30days. The combustion of the lignins and their respective emulsions was performed, and their higher heating values (HHVs) were quantified. The HHVs of CML and a high-internal-phase (WOR=30:70) O/W emulsion were 20 and 30MJkg(-1), respectively. Overall, we propose the stabilization of O/W fuel emulsions by lignin as an important avenue in the utilization of this abundant biomacromolecule.

Decorating NiFe catalysts with other transition metals offers a new path to boost their catalytic activities but often suffers from the low controllability of the electronic structures of the NiFe catalytic centers. Here, we report an interfacial atom-substitution strategy to synthesize an electrocatalytic oxygen-evolving NiFeV nanofiber to boost the activity of NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high-valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The NiFeV nanofiber supported on a carbon cloth shows a low overpotential of 181 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), along with long-term stability (>20 h) at 100 mA cm(-2). The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non-noble metal-based OER catalysts.

NaOH modified chitosan was developed and used as a solid catalyst in the aldol condensation of furfural and levulinic acid to produce long carbon chain compounds. At room temperature, the total yield of condensation products reached 94.4% over NaOH/CT-4 catalyst. The amine of chitosan plays an important role in the aldol condensation, which reacted with the aldehyde group of the furfural, producing an intermediate Schiff base and promoting the formation of condensation products. This new route avoided the occurrence of side reactions caused by NaOH. Therefore, the yield of the products was greatly increased. Moreover, kinetic analysis of the condensation reaction and the test of catalyst repeatability were also conducted with NaOH/CT-4. The condensation products were further converted to long-chain branched alkanes by hydrodeoxygenation over the 5 wt% Pd/NbOPO4 catalyst. As a potential application, these alkanes could be mixed with and used as the components of jet fuels.

Urea and corn steep liquor were identified as the most significant factors by the two-level Plackett-Burman design. Steepest ascent experiments were applied to approach the optimal region of the two factors and a central composite design was employed to determine their optimal levels. Under the optimal medium, the yield of 2,3-butanediol plus acetoin relative to glucose and xylose was up to 0.428 g/g, which was 85.6% of theoretical value. The cheap nitrogen source and nutrition factors combining the co-fermentation process using lignocellulose derived glucose and xylose as the carbon Source in the developed medium would be a potential solution to improve the economics of microbial 23-butanediol production.

J	Sinclair, R; Li, H; Madsen, S; Dai, HJ				Sinclair, Robert; Li, He; Madsen, Steven; Dai, Hongjie			HREM analysis of graphite-encapsulated metallic nanoparticles for possible medical applications	ULTRAMICROSCOPY			English	Article						Metallic nanoparticles; HREM; Computed tomography; Magnetic resonance imaging	NANOTECHNOLOGY; CANCER	High resolution electron microscopy has been applied to study the structure of metallic nanoparticles. These have sparked considerable interest as contrast agents in the held of biological imaging, including in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Here, we describe a method of synthesizing sub-10 rim superparamagnetic metal and alloy nanoparticles by reduction of metallic salts. Annealing at 900 degrees C in a methane/hydrogen environment forms a thin graphitic-carbon shell which is expected to improve stability, biocompatibility, and functionalization. Subsequent high resolution electron microscopy verifies graphitization and allows for crystallographic analysis. Most particles consist of single crystals in the phase predicted for the bulk material at the annealing temperature. Electron energy loss spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and lattice constant measurements show large variation in composition for alloy nanoparticles from a single synthesis. The magnetization relaxation time (T-2) measurements demonstrate that Fe and AuFe nanoparticles compete with commercially available iron oxide MRI contrast agents. X-ray attenuation measurements of an AuFe alloy nanoparticle solution gave a relative radiodensity of 280 Hounsfield Units, demonstrating promise as a dual-purpose contrast agent in CT and MRI. Long term stability in an atmospheric environment was also tested, with no signs of corrosion or oxidation after several years of storage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Porous nanomaterials with uniform pore structures are ideal supports for metal nanoparticles (MNPs) to generate efficient shape-selective catalysis. However, many commercial irregular porous nanomaterials face the challenge to realize satisfactory shape selectivity due to the lack of molecular sieving structures. Herein, we report a concept of creating shape selectivity in MNPs/porous nanomaterials through intentionally poisoning certain MNPs using suitable modifiers. The remaining MNPs within the substrates can cooperate with the channels to generate selectivity. Such a strategy not only applies to regular porous nanomaterials (such as MOFs, zeolites) but also extended to irregular porous nanomaterials (such as active carbon, P25). Potentially, the matching among different MNPs, corresponding modifiers, and porous nanomaterials makes our strategy promising in selective catalytic systems.

The thin film was deposited onto the glass by magnetron-sputtering using carbon steel targets in an Ar atmosphere. The physical properties of fabricated thin films were investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, adhesion test and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). To ensure that the thin film could replicate the corrosion behavior of a bulk steel, the electrochemical polarization tests were performed. It was revealed that the adhesion strength and the electrochemical behaviors of thin films were comparable to those of the bulk steel by controlling the oxygen level in the films during the deposition process. A sensitive thin film electrical resistance (TFER) sensor could be fabricated with this film and the enhanced sensitivity enables quick measurement of the corrosion rate. The TFER sensor with the multiple-line pattern showed the enhanced sensitivity to localized corrosion phenomena. It was demonstrated that this method could be a reliable tool for corrosion monitoring. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

Currently, the majority of hydrogen is generated from fossil fuels. However, from an environmental perspective, sustainable hydrogen production from low-cost lignocellulosic biomass should be considered. Thermophilic hydrogen production is attractive, since it can potentially convert a variety of biomass-based substrates into hydrogen at high yields. Results: Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was used as the substrate for hydrogen production by Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27/Delta ldh. The key parameters of acid hydrolysis were studied through the response surface methodology. The hydrogen production was maximized under the conditions of 2.3% of H2SO4 for 114.2 min at 115 degrees C. Using these conditions, a best hydrogen yield of 1.86 mol H-2/mol total sugar and a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 0.52 L/L h were obtained from 2 L SCB hydrolysates in a 5-L fermentor, showing a superior performance to the results reported in the literature. Additionally, no obvious carbon catabolite repression (CCR) was observed during the fermentation using the multi-sugars as substrates. Conclusions: Considering these advantages and theimpressive HPR, the potential of hydrogen production using T. aotearoense SCUT27/Delta ldh is intriguing. Thermophilic, anaerobic fermentation using SCB hydrolysates as the medium by this strain would be a practical and eco-friendly process.

In this paper, an improved sample separation and quantification method using cadmium saturation combined with anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) was developed to measure the two major isoforms of MT (MT-I and MT-II) in fish. Replacing sulfur with cadmium as the quantitative element by cadmium saturation reduced the instrumental requirement and analysis cost. In the chromatographic separation, NH3-NH4Cl buffer was applied as the mobile phase instead of Tris-HCl buffer to prevent carbon deposition on the ICP cone. The chloride concentration was found to be a key factor to the separation of MT-I and MT-II, and the optimum chromatographic condition was 27 mM of NH3-NH4Cl in isocratic mode, with a pH of 8.6 and a flow rate of 0.8 mL min(-1). The limits of detection were 0.7 mu g g(-1) for MT-I and 1.0 mu g g(-1) for MT-II, with recoveries ranging from 96.2 to 104.2% for MT-I and 84.7 to 90.4% for MT-II in different fish tissues. The relative standard deviations were less than 8% for both isoforms.

The non-coincidence effect (NCE) of gamma-Caprolactone was determined in carbon tetrachloride solution and DMSO solution. The NCE of the nu(11)(C=O) stretching mode in the gamma-Caprolactone/DMSO mixtures exhibits a linear plot, in contrast to that in the gamma-Caprolactone/CCl4 mixtures, which shows an upward (convex) curvature. The reduction and enhancement of the dimer structure (short-range orientational order) of.-Caprolactone in the gamma-Caprolactone/DMSO and gamma-Caprolactone/CCl4 mixtures respectively may play a major role in shifting of peak frequencies, thus the geometries of monomer and dimer of gamma-Caprolactone were calculated at the B3LYP-D3/6-311 G (d,p) level of theory. We proposed aggregated model to explain the gamma-Caprolactone C=O vibration NCE phenomenon and its concentration effect and found it largely consistent with our experimental findings. Solvent dependent experiment show the value of NCE declined with the increase of the solvent dielectric constant under the same condition which is consistent with the Logan's theory.

A new paraffin-based solid fuel with favorable mechanical strength, consisting of 50 wt% paraffin, 20 wt% PE wax, 18 wt% EVA, 10 wt% SA and 2 wt% carbon, was proposed. The thermal properties of the proposed paraffin-based fuel and its components were firstly evaluated using TG/DTG measurements. It was found that the decomposition rates of each of the components of this paraffin-based fuel follow the order SA > pure paraffin > paraffin-based fuel blends > PE > EVA. Measurements of the regression rate of this paraffin-based fuel were performed and compared with results found in the literature. This showed that the regression rate of this paraffin based fuel is much higher than that of traditional polymer solid fuels such as HTPB fuels. Finally, by adding a protrusion, a cavity and swirl blades at the end and in the middle of the combustion chamber, experimental investigations into the effects of a mix-enhancer on the paraffin-based hybrid rocket motor were performed. These investigations are discussed in detail. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Based on the potentialresolution strategy, a facile ECL multiplexed immunoassay was constructed on single indium tin oxide working electrode for sequential detection of carcinoma antigen 153 and carcinoma antigen 199 (one working electrode for two analytes) by employing an anodic ECL label (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)-conjugated silica nanoparticles, +1.20 V) and a cathodic one (carbon nanocrystals dotted silica nanoparticles, -1.20 V). Under the optimal condition, the proposed multiplexed immunoassay displayed wide linear range with low detection limit, and the assay results for two tumor markers in human serum samples obtained by this system were in acceptable agreements with the reference values from commercially used method in Cancer Research Center of Shandong Tumor Hospital. The rechargeable battery-based ECL system and potential-resolution strategy equipped with a self-assembly toggle switch provided a low-cost, promising multiplexed immunoassay for point-of-care diagnosis.

Composite electrode materials, Zn0.76Co0.24S/Co3S4, with different morphologies on three-dimensional nickel foam have been fabricated for the first time using a facile hydrothermal method and successive anion exchange technique. Different surfactants, ammonium fluoride (NH4F) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), contributed to developing various morphologies, with hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) serving as the alkaline source. The mechanisms of the surfactants that acted on the morphologies of the electrode materials were analyzed by adjusting their ratios. The NH4F actuated flower-like Zn0.76Co0.24S/Co3S4 demonstrated a superior specific capacitance of 2798.16 F g(-1) at 5 mA cm(-2) and retained outstanding cyclic stability of 93.8% after 7000 cycles, compared to the grass-like Zn0.76Co0.24S/Co3S4 actuated by PVP. The assembly of the all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), flower-like Zn0.76Co0.24S/Co3S4//RGO, resulted in a high energy density of about 62.22 W h kg(-1) and a maximum power density of 16 kW kg(-1), as well as a long cycle life (86.3% of capacity retention after 8000 cycles). This comprehensive study on the control of the morphologies of transition metal sulfide composites by surfactants provides a general method to synthesize multicomponent electrode materials for energy storage devices.

In this work, spent mushroom substrate (SMS) was co-pyrolyzed with oil shale semi -coke (OSS) to investigate the effects of the OSS on yield and chemical compositions of bio-oil product. Oil shale semi -coke was mixed with biomass in the OSS/SMS mass ratios of 0:1, 1:4, 1:1, 4:1 and 1:0. The pyrolysis experiment was carried out by using a lab -scale pyrolysis reactor. The experimental results showed that the addition of the OSS led to an increase of bio-oil yield. The maximum of bio-oil yield was obtained at the OSS/SMS mass ratio of 1:1. The characteristics of the obtained oils were studied by elemental analyzer, FTIR and GC MS. It was found that the bio-oil obtained from the pyrolysis of mixed SMS and OSS had higher carbon and hydrogen content, lower oxygen content than those produced by the pyrolysis of biomass alone. Moreover, there were more aromatics and aliphatic compounds in the obtained bio-oil product. These variations indicated that the existence of the OSS significantly influenced the chemical compositions of bio-oil. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This improvement in epsilon-PL production and cell mass production can be related to 0.5% n-dodecane that could maintain dissolved oxygen concentration >32% saturation throughout the course of the epsilon-PL production phase. The transcription level of key genes and enzyme activities were analyzed. Results showed that the metabolic pathway responsible for epsilon-PL synthesis was strengthened when n-dodecane was added. The change in intracellular nucleotide levels was also investigated. Higher ATP level and a lower NADH/NAD(+) ratio were obtained with 0.5% n-dodecane in broth, thereby providing more energy for epsilon-PL synthesis. These results indicated that epsilon-PL synthesis was strengthened from carbon metabolism and energy metabolism with 0.5% n-dodecane in broth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A lap shear strength (LSS) improvement of 28% was reported for joints with lower cooling rates relative to joints without controlled cooling process, and the crystallinity degrees measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of lower-cooling-rate joints were also higher. The fatigue performances showed the same trend. The polarized optical microscope (POM) images showed that stainless steel (SS) wires in the HEs acted as heterogeneous nucleating agents, promoting high-density nucleation sites and accelerating formation of transcrystallinity at a cooling rate lower than 80 degrees C/min, and the transcrystallinity was hardly observed at higher cooling rates. The results of crystallization kinetics also showed that the Avrami exponent n reduced with cooling rate increasing, indicating that a two-dimensional growth of transcrystallinity dominated at lower cooling rates.

Here, this study applied the photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) to reduce the concentration of organics in ROC. Meanwhile, the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) was investigated. Participation of primary oxidants in organics removal and DBPs formation was revealed at different anodic potentials and pHs. The results showed that PEC process effectively oxidized the organics in ROC, achieving the highest mineralization rate of 63%. Increasing anodic potential from 0 to 1.0 V enhanced the oxidations of bulk organics (i.e., dissolved organic carbons (DOC), UV254, fluorescence, large molecular weight compounds) and trace-level pharmaceuticals. Raising anodic potential to higher than 1.0 V slightly benefited the oxidations of bulk organics, owing to the relatively stable formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH.) and radical reactive chlorine species (r-RCS). The continuously rising concentration of free chlorine (FC) accelerated the decompositions of pharmaceuticals at >= 1.0 V. However, the generated FC raised the concentration of DBPs up to 10.36 mu mol/L at 3.0 V. Lowering initial pH from 7-9 to 4-6 improved the mineralization rates by around 20% due to the higher formation of OH. at pH 4-6. Further decreasing initial pH from 6 to 4 enhanced the breakdown of large molecular weight compounds as well as the decomposition of pharmaceuticals. This came from the strengthened formation of FC and r-RCS at lower pHs. The intense participation of FC and r-RCS resulted in a higher total DBP concentration at pH 4-6 than that at pH 7-9. However, the individual species of DBPs changed differently toward the pH shift. The results of this study show that PEC could be an alternative for organics oxidation in ROC with proper control of DBPs formation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we first conducted a comparison of different signal peptides and promoters for the construction of the productive lipase A strain. The maximum extracellular lipase activity was identified as 64.9 U/mL after 12-h fermentation at 37 degrees C by B. subtilis L25 in which the lipase gene was led by SPlipA and controlled by P-43-P-hag. Another aim was to determine whether supplementing a culture medium with a combination of glycerol and Streptomyces sp. SCUT-3 digested chicken feather hydrolysates was beneficial to lipase production. Systematic optimization experiments were designed and carried out. Finally, a satisfactory lipase level of 1164.9 U/mL was accomplished in Terrific-Broth medium at a C/N ratio of 0.5 (v/v). This work demonstrates the feasibility of B. subtilis L25 for lipase A industrial production using glycerol and microbes treated chicken feather hydrolysates as inexpensive carbon and nitrogen source.

The aim of this study was to evaluate its feasibility to predict a series of soil properties including organic matter (OM), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK) and pH of paddy soils in Zhejiang province, China. Firstly, the linear partial least squares regression (PLSR) was performed on the in situ spectra and the predictions were compared to those with laboratory-based recorded spectra. Then, the non-linear least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithm was carried out aiming to extract more useful information from the in situ spectra and improve predictions. Results show that in terms of OC, OM, TN, AN and pH, (i) the predictions were worse using in situ spectra compared to laboratory-based spectra with PLSR algorithm (ii) the prediction accuracy using LS-SVM (R-2>0.75, RPD>1.90) was obviously improved with in situ vis-NIR spectra compared to PLSR algorithm, and comparable or even better than results generated using laboratory-based spectra with PLSR; (iii) in terms of AP and AK, poor predictions were obtained with in situ spectra (R-2<0.5, RPD<1.50) either using PLSR or LS-SVM. The results highlight the use of LS-SVM for in situ vis-NIR spectroscopic estimation of soil properties of paddy soils.

NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW			English	Article						wetting; contact-line hysteresis; surface-pinning defects; electrochemical-stability windows; Li-graphite composite	LITHIUM METAL ANODE; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; BATTERIES; ROBUST	Graphite and lithium metal are two classic anode materials and their composite has shown promising performance for rechargeable batteries. However, it is generally accepted that Li metal wets graphite poorly, causing its spreading and infiltration difficult. Here we show that graphite can either appear superlithiophilic or lithiophobic, depending on the local redox potential. By comparing the wetting performance of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite, porous carbon paper (PCP), lithiated PCP and graphite powder, we demonstrate that the surface contaminants that pin the contact-line motion and cause contact-angle hysteresis have their own electrochemical-stability windows. The surface contaminants can be either removed or reinforced in a time-dependent manner, depending on whether the reducing agents (C-6 -> LiC6) or the oxidizing agents (air, moisture) dominate in the ambient environment, leading to bifurcating dynamics of either superfast or superslow wetting. Our findings enable new fabrication technology for Li-graphite composite with a controllable Li-metal/graphite ratio and present great promise for the mass production of Li-based anodes for use in high-energy-density batteries.

In this work, we demonstrate that the fine tuning of adjacent bimetallic sites can allow us to select different reaction pathways toward C-1 or C-2 products in the electroreduction of CO. Cu and Cu-Au alloy catalysts with different atomic ratios were fabricated and investigated for appropriate molecular distances. The pure Cu catalyst was found to be active for electroreducing CO to C2H4, as the adjacent Cu sites were beneficial for adsorbing multiple CO molecules and subsequent C-C coupling. On the other hand, alloying Cu with Au introduced steric hindrance and a larger intermolecular distance between adjacent adsorbed *CO intermediates, thus leading to a decrease of C2H4 selectivity but an enhanced CH4 pathway. Our work revealed the importance of spacing between active sites for CO electroreduction, which can benefit the catalyst design to further improve activities and selectivities in electrocatalytic CO reduction.

Platinum Nanoparticle Functionalized CNTs as Nanoscaffolds and Catalysts To Enhance the Dehydrogenation of Ammonia-Borane	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							HYDROGEN STORAGE; THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; LITHIUM; HYDRIDES; ALKALI	In this paper, the dehydrogenation properties of ammonia-borane (AB, NH3BH3) modified with platinum nanoparticle functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Pt@CNTs) that were prepared through a new "ammonia-deliquescence" method are reported. It has been demonstrated that the synergetic catalysis of CNTs and platinum nanoparticles, and the nanoconfinement of AB incorporated into the CNTs are two crucial factors in enhancing the dehydrogenation of AB. Both CNTs and platinum nanoparticles showed favorable catalytic activities toward the thermolysis of AB, which not only depressed the emission of the poisonous byproduct borazine, but also prevented severe material foaming and expansion during the decomposition. Meanwhile, the nanoconfinement of AB through the "ammonia-deliquescence" method led to enhanced dehydrogenation kinetics, releasing the first equivalent of hydrogen at 70 degrees C within 5 h, while no hydrogen was released from pristine AB under the same conditions. By the Arrhenius method, the activation energy of the modified AB was calculated to be 106.2 kJ mol(-1), which is reduced considerably compared to the activation energy for the pristine AB (137.8 kJ mol(-1)). These results indicate that the "ammonia-deliquescence" method combined with the utilization of Pt@CNTs as catalyst is an effective approach in modifying the properties of AB with favorable dehydrogenation.

The results indicated that the visible absorption and Raman spectra are both red-shifted, Raman scattering cross section increase with the temperature decreasing. And with the pressure increasing, the visible absorption spectra are red-shifted, but the frequency shift towards higher frequencies in the Raman spectra, the Raman scattering cross section decrease unexpectedly. The latter can't be explained by the model of "effective conjugation length" and "coherent weakly damped electron-lattice vibrations". In. this paper, we combined electron-vibration coupling rule with theoretical calculations and found that the electron-phonon coupling constant had a certain changing trend with the temperature and pressure variation, which Indicate that the interaction between pi-electron and CC bond vibration was essential for this experiment result. Thus, the turning effect of energy gap of the pi on CC vibration mode is responsible for such phenomenon.

Characterization and intercomparison of aerosol absorption photometers: result of two intercomparison workshops	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							FILTER-BASED MEASUREMENTS; ATTENUATION CROSS-SECTION; VISIBLE-LIGHT ABSORPTION; BLACK CARBON CONTENT; INTEGRATING NEPHELOMETERS; AMBIENT MEASUREMENTS; SOOT PARTICLES; AETHALOMETER; CALIBRATION; SIZE	Absorption photometers for real time application have been available since the 1980s, but the use of filter-based instruments to derive information on aerosol properties (absorption coefficient and black carbon, BC) is still a matter of debate. Several workshops have been conducted to investigate the performance of individual instruments over the intervening years. Two workshops with large sets of aerosol absorption photometers were conducted in 2005 and 2007. The data from these instruments were corrected using existing methods before further analysis. The inter-comparison shows a large variation between the responses to absorbing aerosol particles for different types of instruments. The unit to unit variability between instruments can be up to 30% for Particle Soot Absorption Photometers (PSAPs) and Aethalometers. Multi Angle Absorption Photometers (MAAPs) showed a variability of less than 5%. Reasons for the high variability were identified to be variations in sample flow and spot size. It was observed that different flow rates influence system performance with respect to response to absorption and instrumental noise. Measurements with non absorbing particles showed that the current corrections of a cross sensitivity to particle scattering are not sufficient. Remaining cross sensitivities were found to be a function of the total particle load on the filter. The large variation between the response to absorbing aerosol particles for different types of instruments indicates that current correction functions for absorption photometers are not adequate.

In this study, the effect of H2S under excess nitrate stress in tomato root was studied. The results showed that excess nitrate inhibited the growth of tomato seedlings, while application of the H2S donor NaHS efficiently alleviated the growth inhibition, and decreased the lipid peroxidation, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and protein carbonyl contents, as well as the reactive oxygen species accumulation, especially 100 mu M NaHS. Treatment with NaHS under nitrate stress increased the endogenous H2S and L-cysteine desulfhydrases (LCD) activity. Moreover, treatment with NaHS induced NO production and the synthesis of NO was mediated through nitrate reductase, but not through nitric oxide synthase in the presence or absence of nitrate. Besides, exogenous NaHS increased antioxidant enzyme genes (SOD, POD, CAT, and APX) expression, reducing the oxidative stress caused by excess nitrate. The alleviating effects of lipid peroxidation, H2O2 contents, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities by NaHS and NO donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP), were reversed by 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO), the specific scavenger of NO. Together, above results suggested that NR-dependent NO production by NaHS was involved in the alleviation of nitrate stress by enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities in tomato root.

By the end of 2016, the continental tight oil in China has established an annual production capacity of 1.55 million tons, and a cumulative oil production of 2.52 million tons. In 2016, the continental tight oil production in China was about 800,000 tons. By analyzing the characterization of the tight oil in Ordos Basin, Songliao Basin, Jungar Basin, the organic-rich shale in China were formed in multiple geological periods including the Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Neogene, and Paleogene, in freshwater, semi-saline to hyper-saline lacustrine depositional setting. They are generally tens of meters to several hundreds of meters thick, have total organic carbon (TOC) contents of 0.4-16%, and thermal maturity of 0.4-1.4%. Algal bloom as results of volcanism, low sedimentation rate, transgression, and stratification of water body are prominent factors controlling the formation of organic-rich shales. Tight oil reservoirs in China mainly include tight sandstone, tight carbonate rock, tight sedimentary tuff, etc., all of which are characterized by strong heterogeneity and poor petrophysical properties, with in situ porosity and permeability generally no more 12% and 1 x 10(-3) mu m(2) respectively. They are also characterized by tight pore-throat systems of nano- to micro-scales, with pore throat diameters in the range of 80-1800 nm, and complex pore structures. The producing reservoirs have pressure coefficients between 0.7 and 1.8, covering under-pressure to over-pressure. Crude oil properties vary greatly with densities ranging from 0.75 to 0.92 g/cm(3). It is believed that the abundance and effectiveness of hydrocarbon supply controls the formation of oil saturation, and tight oil "sweet spots" are generally in or near the areas with high hydrocarbon expulsion intensities. In addition, the quality of the source rock and the type of source reservoir control the distribution of the "sweet spots", and storage space and movable fluid guarantee the formation of the "sweet spot" area of high oil saturation. "Sweet spots" are often developed in local mini-structural highs under a broad and gentle-sloped background. Continental tight oil in China has estimated geological resource of 14.66 x 10(9) tons with a technically recoverable resource of 1.45 x 10(9) tons. Tight oil is mainly distributed in Ordos Basin, Songliao Basin, Bohai Bay Basin, Junggar Basin, and Qaidam Basin, within the Mesozoic and Cenozoic formations. Overall China has a relatively large tight oil reserve and good exploration prospect.

Overpressure and petroleum generation and accumulation in the Dongying Depression of the Bohaiwan Basin, China	GEOFLUIDS			English	Article						basin modeling; Bohaiwan Basin; Dongying Depression; overpressure; petroleum accumulation; petroleum generation		The occurrence of abnormally high formation pressures in the Dongying Depression of the Bohaiwan Basin, a prolific oil-producing province in China, is controlled by rapid sedimentation and the distribution of centres of active petroleum generation. Abnormally high pressures, demonstrated by drill stem test (DST) and well log data, occur in the third and fourth members (Es3 and Es4) of the Eocene Shahejie Formation. Pressure gradients in these members commonly fall in the range 0.012-0.016MPa m(-1), although gradients as high as 0.018 MPa m(-1) have been encountered. The zone of strongest overpressuring coincides with the areas in the central basin where the principal lacustrine source rocks, which comprise types I and II kerogen and have a high organic carbon content (>2%, ranging to 7.3%), are actively generating petroleum at the present day. The magnitude of overpressuring is related not only to the burial depth of the source rocks, but to the types of kerogen they contain. In the central basin, the pressure gradient within submember Es32, which contains predominantly type II kerogen, falls in the range 0.013-0.014MPa m(-1). Larger gradients of 0.014-0.016MPa m(-1) occur in submember Es33 and member Es4, which contain mixed type I and II kerogen. Numerical modelling indicates that, although overpressures are influenced by hydrocarbon generation, the primary control on overpressure in the basin comes from the effects of sediment compaction disequilibrium. A large number of oil pools have been discovered in the domes and faulted anticlines of the normally pressured strata overlying the overpressured sediments; the results of this study suggest that isolated sandstone reservoirs within the overpressured zone itself offer significant hydrocarbon potential.

Application of a SUGAR model to analyse sugar accumulation in peach cultivars that differ in glucose-fructose ratio	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							PRUNUS-PERSICA; CARBOHYDRATE-METABOLISM; SUCROSE ACCUMULATION; GENOTYPIC VARIATION; FRUIT-DEVELOPMENT; SORBITOL; QUALITY; ENZYMES; TOMATO; NECTARINES	A SUGAR model, which was established to predict the partitioning of carbon into sucrose, glucose, fructose and sorbitol in fruit mesocarp of peach cultivars (Prunus persica (L.) Batch) with normal glucose: fructose ratio (G:F) of 0.8-1-5, was evaluated and extended for peach cultivars with a high G:F ratio of 1.5-7.8. The extended model (SUGARb) is more generic and assumes a high G:F ratio to be due to preferential transformation of sorbitol into glucose, preferential utilization of fructose or preferential conversion of fructose into glucose. The simulated seasonal variations in sugars via the SUGARb-model-matched experimental data for three normal and three high G:F cultivars well, and accurately exhibited G:F ratio characteristics. The relative rates of sucrose transformation into glucose and fructose differed according to cultivar but not according to G:F status. Compared with hexosephosphate interconversion, a lower production rate of fructose than glucose from sorbitol, and/or a higher utilization rate of fructose than that of glucose might be preferential alternatives for forming high G:F ratios in the high G:F cultivars studied in the present study, which is discussed in the light of recent results on enzyme activities.

J	Liu, R; Zeng, LW; Gong, R; Yuan, FN; Shu, HB; Li, S				Liu, Rui; Zeng, Lin-Wen; Gong, Rong; Yuan, Fanen; Shu, Hong-Bing; Li, Shu			mTORC1 activity regulates post-translational modifications of glycine decarboxylase to modulate glycine metabolism and tumorigenesis	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CLEAVAGE SYSTEM; P-PROTEIN; MAMMALIAN PROTEIN; SERINE; CGAS	Glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) is a key enzyme of glycine cleavage system that converts glycine into one-carbon units. GLDC is commonly up-regulated and plays important roles in many human cancers. Whether and how GLDC is regulated by post-translational modifications is unknown. Here we report that mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signal inhibits GLDC acetylation at lysine (K) 514 by inducing transcription of the deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). Upon inhibition of mTORC1, the acetyltransferase acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) catalyzes GLDC K514 acetylation. This acetylation of GLDC impairs its enzymatic activity. In addition, this acetylation of GLDC primes for its K33-linked polyubiquitination at K544 by the ubiquitin ligase NF-X1, leading to its degradation by the proteasomal pathway. Finally, we find that GLDC K514 acetylation inhibits glycine catabolism, pyrimidines synthesis and glioma tumorigenesis. Our finding reveals critical roles of post-translational modifications of GLDC in regulation of its enzymatic activity, glycine metabolism and tumorigenesis, and provides potential targets for therapeutics of cancers such as glioma. An increase in glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) activity, a key enzyme for glycine catabolism, has been associated to tumourigenesis. Here, the authors show that mTORC1 activation induces GLDC deacetylation which impairs its ubiquitin-associated degradation leading to increased GLDC activity and tumourigenesis.

In the current study, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) foaming technique was adopted to fabricate mesoporous bioactive glasses (MBGs) particle-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) composite scaffolds with appropriate mechanical and degradation properties as well as in vitro bioactivity. The MBG-PLGA scaffolds incorporating the bioactive lipid FTY720 (designated as FTY/MBG-PLGA) exhibited simultaneously sustained release of the bioactive lipid and ions. In addition to providing a favorable microenvironment for cellular adhesion and proliferation, FTY/MBG-PLGA scaffolds significantly facilitated the in vitro osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs and also markedly stimulated the upregulation of Hif-1 alpha expression via the activation of the Erk1/2 pathway, which mediated the osteogenic and pro-angiogenic effects on rBMSCs. Furthermore, FTY/MBG-PLGA extracts induced superior in vitro angiogenic performance of HUVECs. In vivo evaluation of critical-sized rat calvarial bone defects indicated that FTY/MBG-PLGA scaffolds potently promoted vascularized bone regeneration. Notably, the significantly enhanced formation of type H vessels (CD31 (hi)Emcn(hi) neo-vessels) was observed in newly formed bone tissue in FTY/MBG-PLGA group, strongly suggesting that FTY720 and therapeutic ions released from the scaffolds synergistically induced more type H vessel formation, which indicated the coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis to achieve efficiently vascularized bone regeneration. Overall, the results indicated that the foamed porous MBG-PLGA scaffolds incorporating bioactive lipids achieved desirable vascularization-coupled bone formation and could be a promising strategy for bone regenerative medicine. Statement of Significance Efficacious coupling of vascularization and bone formation is critical for the restoration of large bone defects. A novel technique was used to fabricate composite scaffolds incorporating bioactive lipids which possessed synergistic cues of bioactive lipids and therapeutic ions to potently promote bone regeneration as well as vascularization. The underlying molecular mechanism for the osteogenic and pro-angiogenic effects of the composite scaffolds was unveiled. Interestingly, the scaffolds were further found to enhance the formation of type H capillaries within the bone healing microenvironment to couple angiogenesis to osteogenesis to achieve satisfying vascularized bone regeneration. These findings provide a novel strategy to develop efficiently vascularized engineering constructs to treat massive bone defects. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A comparison between the predictive capability of matrix cracking, damage and failure criteria for fibre reinforced composite laminates: Part A of the third world-wide failure exercise	JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						Damage; matrix cracking; bending; biaxial; third world-wide failure exercise; size effects; open hole	GLASS; STRAIN	This paper provides a set of concluding remarks on Part A of the third world-wide failure exercise where a comparison has been made between the capabilities of 12 different mathematical models for predicting the evolution of matrix cracking, damage and failure in continuous fibre-reinforced polymer composites when subjected to multi-axial loading. The originators (or their collaborators) of those theories have employed their methods to 13 carefully selected challenging problems (test cases) addressing the cracking and damage evolution arising from ply thickness, lay-up sequence, size effects and a variety of loading conditions (biaxial, bending, thermal loading and loading-unloading) of a number of unidirectional and multi-directional glass and carbon epoxy laminates. These covered eight different lay-ups consisting of 0 degrees, [0 degrees/90 degrees/0 degrees], [0 degrees/90 degrees(8)/0 degrees], [0 degrees/90 degrees](s), [+/- 45 degrees](s), [+/- 50 degrees](s), [30 degrees/90 degrees/-30 degrees/90 degrees](s) and a family of [0 degrees(m)/45 degrees(m)/90 degrees(m)/-45 degrees(m)](s), [45 degrees/0 degrees/90 degrees/-45 degrees](s) and [0 degrees/45 degrees/-45 degrees/90 degrees](s) quasi-isotropic laminates. Key features in each theory are identified including: types of damage models employed, whether linear or nonlinear analysis was carried out, reliance on software and numerical methods and identification of modes of damage. The results of stress-strain curves, crack density and damage curves have been superimposed and bar charts were constructed to show similarities and differences between the predictions of the various theories.

A comprehensive and detailed characterization of the spatio-temporal pattern of vegetation phenology can be used to improve the understanding of interactions between vegetation and climate in Africa. This research provides an approach to derive phenology time and trajectory parameters by optimally fitting a double-logistic curve to daily remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager. The proposed algorithm can reconstruct the temporal LAI trajectory based on the optimized parameters with a high accuracy, and provides user-defined phenological timing information (e.g., start/end of the growing season) and trajectory information (e.g., leaf emergence/senescence rate and length) using these fitted parameters. Both single and double growing-season cases have been considered with a spatial classification scheme implemented over Africa. The newly derived vegetation phenology of Africa exhibits emerging spatial patterns in growing season length, asymmetric green-up and green-off length/rate, and distinctive phenological features of cropland and natural vegetation. This approach has the potential to be applied globally, and the derived vegetation phenological information will improve dynamic vegetation modeling and climate prediction.

This paper aims to enhance the performance of SiC ceramics prepared by SLA and LSI techniques via the cyclic impregnation/carbonization of the precursor of carbon source solution before LSI. The effects of impregnation/carbonization cycles on the microstructure and properties of C/SiC preform and sintered body were analyzed in detail. The results show that, with the increase of impregnation/carbonization cycles, the porosity in the C/SiC preform decreases obviously and the content of secondary SiC in the sintered body increases effectively. Especially, when the impregnation/carbonization cycle was performed twice, the sintered body had the optimal mechanical properties. The value of flexural strength, bulk density and elastic modulus were 258.63 +/- 8.33 MPa, 2.95 +/- 0.02 g/cm(3) and 425.16 +/- 14.15 GPa, respectively. In addition, the thermal dimensional stability of sintered body was also improved by this method. This method proves that SiC ceramics prepared by SLA combined with LSI have the potential of applications in space optical mirrors.

First, we observed that EFBs with low flow velocity had a high removal rate for chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), NH4+-N, and total nitrogen (TN). Secondly, we conducted evaluations using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) model and found that EFBs with a flow velocity of 0.91 m/d had a robust, comprehensive removal capacity for CODCr, NH4+-N, and TN. Thirdly, high throughput 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that the microbial community of EFBs at different flow velocities varied significantly. Finally, the microbial community of EFBs with a flow velocity of 0.91 m/d showed the highest richness index, diversity index, and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) number. Moreover, the abundance of the ecological functions responsible for carbon and nitrogen removal was the highest at a flow velocity of 0.91 m/d. The statistical analysis corroborated that flow velocity could affect pollutant removal capacity and microbial community of EFBs.

To circumvent this problem, we used a metabolic profiling approach to analyze metabolite changes in Rhizopus oryzae under different pH conditions. A correlation between fumaric acid production and intracellular metabolic characteristics of R. oryzae was revealed by principal component analysis. The results showed that to help cell survival in the presence of low pH, R. oryzae altered amino acid and fatty acid metabolism and promoted sugar or sugar alcohol synthesis, corresponding with a suppressing of energy metabolism, phenylalanine, and tyrosine synthesis and finally resulting in the low performance of fumaric acid production. Based on this observation, 1 % linoleic acid was added to the culture medium in pH 3.0 to decrease the carbon demand for cell survival, and the fumaric acid titer was enhanced by 39.7 % compared with the control (pH 3.0 without linoleic acid addition), reaching 18.3 g/L after 84 h of fermentation. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which R. oryzae responds to acidic stress and would be helpful for the development of efficient strategies for fumaric acid production at low pH.

The sedimentary environment and the controlling factors of organic matter enrichment, however, are still in contention. In this investigation, the Yishicun outcrop, located on the south margin of the Ordos basin, has been considered for the study. X-ray diffraction, polarizing microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence (CL) were used to investigate the petrological features of the organic-rich shale. The content of volcanic ash and the diameter of pyrite framboid pseudocrystals were measured to illustrate the relationship between oxygen level, ash content and the enrichment of organic matter. It has been found that the diameter of pyrite framboid pseudocrystals has a strong correlation with the total organic carbon, demonstrating that the redox status degree of the water column has a positive impact on the enrichment of organic matter. Additionally, with an increase in the ash content, the content of organic matter increased at first and then decreased, and reached a maximum when the ash content was about 6%, illustrating that the ash input has a double effect on the enrichment of organic matter.

Among all the configurations of PSCs, the printable hole-conductor-free mesoscopic PSC (p-MPSC) has unique advantages on low cost, large-area fabrication and fabulous stability, which endows it with the greatest potential for industrialization. The interfacial recombination losses, especially at the perovskite/carbon interface, are the bottleneck for further improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of p-MPSCs. 2-Bromo-6-fluoronaphthalene is introduced as an interfacial modulator for p-MPSCs through post-treatment. The bromo-terminal acts as an electrophilic site to interact with the iodine ion in perovskite via the noncovalent halogen bond. Meanwhile, the fused ring of naphthalene is capable to accommodate electron density that is attracted from the perovskite. This interaction induces a more favorable band structure at the interface. The hole extraction is promoted and the interfacial nonradiative recombination is inhibited. Accordingly, a champion p-MPSC with an improved PCE of 16.77% from 15.50% of the pristine device is obtained.

In this paper, surface morphology of cutting plain woven carbon fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRP) by fibre laser and the influence of cutting parameters on machined quality were investigated. A full factorial experimental design was employed involving three variable factors, which included laser pulse frequency at three levels together with laser power and cutting speed at two levels. Heat-affected zone (HAZ), kerf depth and kerf angle were quantified to understand the interactions with cutting parameters. Observations of machined surface were analysed relating to various damages using optical microscope and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which included HAZ, matrix recession, fibre protruding, striations, fibre-end swelling, collapses, cavities and delamination. Based on ANOVA analysis, it was found that both cutting speed and laser power were significant factors for HAZ and kerf depth, while laser power was the only significant factor for kerf angle. Besides, HAZ and the kerf depth showed similar sensitivity to the pulse energy and energy per unit length, which was opposite for kerf angle. This paper presented the feasibility and experimental results of cutting CFRP laminates using fibre laser, which is possibly the efficient and high-quality process to promote the development of CFRPs.

In this work, an amorphous carbon core-shell-coated PbTe nanostructure prepared by a "bottom-up" method is first incorporated into the Sn1-ySbyTe matrix to enhance the thermoelectric performance of SnTe. The square-like PbTe nanoparticles maintain their original cubic morphology and do not grow up obviously after the SPS process due to the coating of the C layer, bringing about the formation of nanopores locally, while Sb alloying induces Sb point defects and Sb-rich precipitates. All these unique hierarchical microstructures finally lead to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (similar to 0.48 W-1 m(-1) K-1) approaching amorphous limits (similar to 0.40 W-1 m(-1) K-1). In addition, the incorporation of PbTe@C core-shell nanostructures decreases the carrier mobility obviously with a slight loss in carrier concentration, resulting in the deterioration of electrical properties to a certain extent. As a result, a peak thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 1.07 is achieved for Sn0.89Sb0.11Te-5%PbTe@C at 873 K, which is approximately 154.76% higher than that of pristine SnTe. This work provides a new strategy to enhance the thermoelectric performance of SnTe and also offers a new insight into other related thermoelectric systems.

Headspace fingerprint mass spectrometry to characterize strawberry aroma at super-atmospheric oxygen conditions	POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						strawberries; headspace fingerprint mass spectrometry; high oxygen; modified atmosphere; aroma	ELECTRONIC NOSE; SUPERATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN; VOLATILE COMPOUNDS; SHELF-LIFE; QUALITY; MS; FRUITS; FLAVOR	This paper reports on the relation between super-atmospheric oxygen packaging and aroma production in strawberries. Volatile compounds were extracted from the headspace of strawberries stored at 7 degrees C for 0, 4 and 7 days under different gas conditions. Super-atmospheric oxygen concentrations were applied in combination with or without elevated CO2 concentrations and the volatile production was measured with GC-MS. The potential of headspace fingerprint mass spectrometry (HFMS), a rapid technique for aroma profiling, was evaluated. Canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) based on the 16 most abundant volatile compounds and 26 HFNIS signals (m/z) was applied to discriminate the samples according to gas storage treatment. The results showed that after 4 and 7 days of storage under super-atmospheric oxygen concentrations (without carbon dioxide) the production of ethyl acetate was suppressed. Ethyl acetate is one of the most important off-flavors in strawberries. Samples treated with only oxygen were mainly characterized by the ester methyl hexanoate with pineapple notes. Similar results were obtained with HFMS. CDA also showed that it is possible to classify samples according to days of shelf-life and that the effect of gas conditions was smaller than the effect of days of shelf-life. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Profiling of sugar phosphates is of great significance but full of challenges due to their high structural similarity and low sensitivities in liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS). In this study, we developed a novel stable isotope chemical labeling combined with the reversed-phase (RP)LC-MS method for ultrasensitive determination of sugar phosphates at the single-cell level. By chemical derivatization with 2-(diazo-methyl)-N-methyl-N-phenyl-benzamide (2-DMBA) and d(5)-2-DMBA, sugar phosphate isomers can obtain better separation and identification, and the detection sensitivities of sugar phosphates increased by 3.5-147 folds. The obtained limits of detection of sugar phosphates ranged from 5 to 16 pg/mL. Using this method, we achieved ultrasensitive and accurate quantification of 12 sugar phosphates in different trace biological samples. Benefiting from the improved separation and detection sensitivity, we successfully quantified five sugar phosphates (D-glucose 1-phosphate, D-mannose 6-phosphate, D-fructose 6-phosphate, D-glucose 6-phosphate, and seduheptulose 7-phosphate) in a single protoplast of Arabidopsis thaliana.

Here, an organic/inorganic composite gel electrolyte (PPPL) as GPEs is proposed, which is formed by ring-opening polymerization reaction of poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride) (PMVE-MA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in polymer matrix of poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) embedded with Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) particles. The PMVE-MA participates in the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and the PEG greatly improves the flexibility of PPPL. The PPPL exhibits excellent performance in terms of a wide electrochemical window (4.7 V), high lithium transference number (0.59), and satisfactory mechanical strength (11 MPa). Besides, the PPPL contributes to the formation of stable and flexible SEI containing organic components and LiF on lithium metal, and constructs fast and uniform lithium transport channels to effectively suppress the lithium dendrite growth. The Li/PPPL/Li symmetric batteries can stably cycle 800 h at the high current density of 5 mA cm(-2) and capacity of 5 mAh cm(-2). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the PPPL will provide important insights for design of advanced GPEs.

Nano-sized Mg-BDC MOF structures with high purity and high yields (similar to 81%) were obtained and used as a new nanofiller in Poly (ethylene oxide) PEO-based polymer matrix. The crystalline structure of nano-sized Mg-BDC MOF were confirmed by the characteristic diffraction peaks based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The spherical shape and smooth structure of nano-sized Mg-BDC MOF were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses. Their dimensions were found to be in the range of similar to 20 nm. PEO nanocomposite electrolyte consisting of Mg-BDC MOF was successfully prepared by using solution casting method. The homogeneous distribution of nano-sized Mg-BDC MOF nanoparticles within the PEO electrolyte matrix was examined by SEM analysis. The reason for the size reduction and uniform distribution of nano-sized Mg-BDC MOF was expressed as the positive physical interactions between the surface functional groups of PEO and Mg-BDC during the solution casting process and the absence of any possible Mg-BDC nanoparticle aggregation.

The Black-P crystals are found grown in situ at the site where the solid clathrate originally resides, which suggests chemical vapor mineralizer does not play a critical role for the Black-P formation. More detailed systematical studies have indicated the P vacancies in the framework of the ternary clathrate Sn24P22-xI8 are important for the subsequent Black-P from phosphorus vapors, and a likely vapor solid solid model is responsible for the Black-P crystal growth. The obtained room temperature mobility mu is similar to 350 cm(2)/V.s from Hall measurements at mechanically cleaved flakes, where noticeable microcracks are visible. The obtained high mobility value further suggests the high quality of the Black-P crystals synthesized through this route.

As the synergetic introduction of g-C3N4 nanosheets might promote the electron transfer in CeO2, the resulting g-C3N4/CeO2 nanozyme was found to present greatly enhanced catalytic activity, as demonstrated by the steady-state kinetic studies, which is nearly 4-fold higher than that of pure CeO2. Moreover, the g-C3N4/CeO2 nanozymes would aggregate in the presence of Hg2+ ions due to the strong interaction between Hg2+ and the nitrogen of g-C3N4, leading to a decrease of catalysis rationally depending on the Hg2+ ion concentration. A colorimetric analysis strategy is therefore developed for the selective detection of Hg2+ ions separately in the complex samples of blood and wastewater, showing a linear concentration range from 0.50 nM to 800 nM with the LOD of 0.23 nM as exemplified for Hg2+ ions in blood. Also, the recovery tests indicated that the developed colorimetric method can allow for the accurate analysis of Hg2+ ions in wastewater and blood. Such a route for the fabrication of composite nanozymes by growing catalytic nanomaterials on conductive 2D substrates may be extended to the design of other kinds of nanozymes with enhanced catalytic performances for developing catalysis-based detection platforms.

To investigate possible association, unrelated controls (n=461) with no history of psychiatric disorders and patients (n=501) diagnosed with bipolar disorder were recruited in this study. In addition, six association studies published up to June 2008 were included in a subsequent meta-analysis. No significant difference was found in either allele frequencies or genotype distribution between patients and controls in our association study in the Chinese population. Similarly, the meta-analysis result showed no significant association between MTHFR C677T and bipolar disorder. In conclusion, the MTHFR C677T variant is unlikely to play a major role in the susceptibility to bipolar disorder, although MTHFR plays an important role in the one-carbon metabolism and DNA methylation.

In this study, different extraction solvents, redissolution solvents and adsorbents were tested according to the recovery and purification effect to obtain a modified QuEChERS method. The samples were extracted with acetonitrile. During the clean-up step, octadecyl-modified silica (C18) and graphitized carbon black (GCB) were selected, and aminopropyl (NH2) was used instead of primary secondary amine (PSA) because of its weaker ion exchange capacity which had little effect on the recovery of ditalimfos. Samples were quantified by matrix-matched calibration with internal standards. All pesticides showed good linearity in the respective range, both with values of r(2) > 0.99. The average recoveries of the pesticides spiked samples ranged from 70.0% to 112.2% with the RSDs of 0.2%-14.4%. The modified QuEChERS method was validated and applied to twenty real samples. Five pesticides were found in eight batches, but no pesticide exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRL, MRL reference to European commission). (C) 2019 Xi'an Jiaotong University.

Herein, two types of Ni-Co alloys are generated on SiO2 including non-homogeneous or homogeneous form for CO methanation. The formation of homogeneous Ni-Co alloy originates from the strong interaction between Ni and Co and a small amount of CoO. Compared with non-homogeneous alloy, the homogeneous Ni-Co alloy exhibits superior CO conversion and CH4 selectivity below 380 degrees C, and is stable for 100 h long-term test at 400 degrees C in CO methanation. The electron enrichment of Ni and Co of homogeneous alloy contributes to CO dissociation, hydrogen spillover, and CO2 adsorption, which facilitates CH4 formation and the removal of deposited carbon species. This work provides a new clue for fabricating bimetallic catalysts and revealing the relationship between the fine structure of Ni-Co alloy and their catalytic performances.

Total PAH concentrations in the sediment ranged from 590 to 23,250 ng/g. The alkylated phenanthrene/phenanthrene and alkylated pyrene/pyrene ratios displayed a strong correlation with the total PAH concentrations, suggesting that the sediments were heavily impacted by petrogenic PAHs. This finding was consistent with the ratios and compositional features of hopanes and steranes, and confirmed the presence of mature petroleum in the sediments. The sedimentary total organic carbon contents were correlated with the organic pollutant concentrations (R-2 = 0.81-0.88), suggesting that the distribution was controlled by an extensive point source and/or transport and sedimentation processes. Principal component analysis results indicated two major sources of inputs to the aquatic environment in the area: (1) discharge from the Daguanhe River, and (2) leakage of oil from motor boats in nearby harbors. A gradient of increasing parent PAH (relative to alkylated PAHs) concentrations toward the lower section of Dianchi Lake, as compared to those in the upper section, reflected the resistance of the parent PAHs to degradation and bioavailability during sedimentary steranes and hopanes was explained not by one diffuse single source but, rather, by the lack of change in the composition of oil residues after natural transport and sedimentation processes.

The different microstructures were obtained by annealing coatings at 700 degrees C or as-deposited. The film was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The hydrogen permeation inhibition performance of films was investigated by deuterium permeation experiment. The crystalline structure of the coatings depended on the post-anneal; the crystallite size of the coating increases and the surface exhibits compact surface morphology for the coatings post-annealed at 700 degrees C. The coating post-annealed at 700 degrees C has the correct oxygen/yttrium ratio corresponding well to the stoichiometric Y2O3, while some concentrations of carbon and hydrogen impurities were found in the as-deposited coating. The impurities are present in the form of unreacted or partially reacted precursor molecules due to the incomplete decomposition of the original precursor. The deuterium permeability of the coating improved obviously after post-anneal and was around 240-410 times less than that of the 316L stainless steel, which means efficient inhibition to deuterium permeation.

Recently, Mn(PDP) complexes (PDP = N,N'-bis(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)-2,2'-bipyrrolidine) have been reported to activate C-H bonds selectively in the presence of carboxylic acids. In this study, we performed density functional theory calculations to investigate the formation and hydroxylation mechanisms of Mn(PDP) complexes. Our calculation results showed that Mn(III)(PDP) complexes react with H2O2 and carboxylic acid to form Mn(V)-oxo oxidation intermediate. The main oxidation intermediate, [(PDP)Mn(IV)(O center dot center dot center dot OC(O)CH3)(2-)center dot](2+) , was found to have the characteristics of S(Mn) = 3/2 manganese(IV) center antiferromagnetically coupled to a sigma*(o-o) radical, where the O-O bond is not completely broken. Furthermore, [(PDP)Mn(IV)(O center dot center dot center dot OC(O)CH3)(2-)center dot](2+) was shown to have two single electron-accepting orbitals (alpha Mn-d(xy) and beta sigma*(o-o)) that can simultaneously interact with a doubly occupied electron-donating orbital (sigma(C-H)) of substrate. Therefore, [(PDP)Mn(IV)(O center dot center dot center dot OC(O)CH3)(2-)center dot](2+) species can act as a two-electron oxidant for the C-H bond functionalization. As a result, the C-H bond hydroxylation by [(PDP)Mn(IV)(O center dot center dot center dot OC(O)CH3)(2-)center dot](2+) species was a single step. Following the H-abstraction with a low barrier of 4.5 kcal/mol, hydroxyl group would immediately rebound to the radical carbon without barrier. These results provide new insights toward the further development of non-heme manganese catalysts.

However, well construction of hierarchical molybdate nanostructures towards superior performance has still retained a critical challenge. Herein, hierarchical manganese molybdate (MnMoO4) nanocauliflowers are tailored from aggregated microrods utilizing dopamine as a scissor at room temperature. Meanwhile, a uniform and robust carbon coating layer can be introduced after a simple calcination. The fabricated MnMoO4/C nanocauliflowers exhibit excellent electrochemical properties as anodes for both lithium/sodium ion half/full batteries. The boosted discharge specific capacities and rate capabilities of MnMoO4/C (994 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 487 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 for lithium ion battery and 296 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and 148 mAh g-1 at 2.0 A g-1 for sodium ion battery) are better than those of bare MnMoO4. Notably, the stable and sustainable cyclic property with 1500 times for lithium ion battery and 5000 times for sodium ion battery without obvious capacity fading is much superior to the state-of-art results of many other reported molybdates. This simple yet effective strategy demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous structure engineering and surface modification of molybdates. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Gas temperatures and concentrations, furnace temperatures, boiler efficiencies were measured under various loads. Under deep-air-staging, gas temperatures and their increasing rate are relatively high under various loads, ensuring that low-volatile coal is ignited in time. A decrease in boiler load decreases gas temperatures and their increasing rate, and results in a more distant ignition position. The O-2 consumption rate decreases and variation amplitude of its consumption rate is not apparent. The concentrations of CO and NO generated decrease. Under higher loads, the NO formation first increase and then smoothly decline. Under decreasing load, the furnace temperature decreases slightly in the primary combustion region, and there is a larger decrease in the upper portion of the furnace. With decreasing load, NOx emissions decrease from 871.5 to 743.7 mg/m(3) (6% 02). Compared with results before the retrofit, both exhaust gas temperature and unburned carbon decrease. After the retrofit, boiler efficiencies higher than 91% are achieved under various loads. Meanwhile, the mean NOx emissions decrease from 1271.6, 979.2, 988.0 to 822.4, 796.9, 743.7 mg/m(3) (6% O-2) under boiler load of 300, 230, and 150 MW, respectively. Numerical calculation results agree well with measured results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In our study, a phenanthrene-degrading endophytic Paenibacillus sp. PHE-3 was isolated from P. asiatica L. grown in a PAH-contaminated site. The effects of environmental variables on phenanthrene biodegradation by strain PHE-3 were studied, and the ability of strain PHE-3 to use high molecular weight PAH (HMW-PAH) as a sole carbon source was also evaluated. Our results indicated that pH value of 4.0-8.0, temperature of 30 degrees C-42 degrees C, initial phenanthrene concentration less than 100 mg . L-1, and some additional nutrients are favorable for the biodegradation of phenanthrene by strain PHE-3. The maximum biodegradation efficiency of phenanthrene was achieved at 99.9% after 84 h cultivation with additional glutamate. Moreover, the phenanthrene biodegradation by strain PHE-3 was positively correlated with the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity (rho = 0.981, p < 0.05), suggesting that strain PHE-3 had the capability of degrading HMW-PAHs. In the presence of other 2-,3-ringed PAHs, strain PHE-3 effectively degraded HMW-PAHs through co-metabolism. The results of this study are beneficial in that the re-colonization potential and PAH degradation performance of endophytic Paenibacillus sp. PHE-3 may be applied towards reducing PAH contamination in plants.

Recent studies demonstrated that the nPAHs could represent major soil pollution, however the remediation of nPAHs has been rarely reported. In this study, biological, physical, and chemical methods have been applied to remove 1-nitropyrene, the model nPAH, in contaminated soil. A comparative study with pyrene has also been investigated and evaluated. The results suggest that the physical method with activated carbon is an efficient and economical approach, removing 88.1% and 78.0% of 1-nitropyrene and pyrene respectively, within one day. The zero-valent ion has a similar removal performance on 1-nitropyrene (83.1%), converting 1-nitropyrene to 1-aminopyrene in soil via chemical reduction and decreasing the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of 1-nitropyrene. Biological remediation that employs scallion as a plant model can reduce 55.0% of 1-nitropyrene in soil (from 39.6 to 17.8 mu g/kg), while 77.9% of pyrene can be removed by plant. This indicates that nPAHs might be more persistent than corresponding pPAHs in soil. It is anticipated that this study could draw public awareness of nitro-derivatives of pPAHs and provide remediation technologies of carcinogenic nPAHs in soil.

The catalysts were characterized by means of nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , infrared spectra of pyridine adsorption( Py-IR) , and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis( TG-DTA ). The effect of Sn loading on the catalytic properties of PtSn/Al2O3 in the propane dehydrogenation was studied. The results showed that the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst had high propylene selectivity and catalytic stability. Platinum and tin were mainly in the form of Pt3Sn and PtSn alloys with Pt/Sn ratios of 3 : 1 and 1 : 1. With the formation of the alloy, the dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst was improved significantly , and the high temperature sintering of metal particles was effectively suppressed. When the Pt/Sn ratio was 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 , the metallic Pt was mainly resulted. With the increase of Sn loading, the Lewis acid sites on the catalyst gradually decreased , and the propylene selectivity increased associated with the propane conversion decreased. At the same time, the addition of Sn promoted the migration of carbon deposition from the metal surface to support , and improved the stability of the catalyst.

During the catalytic reaction, size of the particles plays an important role in determining their catalytic performance. Generally, the small particles exhibit superior catalytic activity in comparison with the larger particles because of an increase in low-coordinated metal atoms on the particle surface that work as active sites, such as edges and corner atoms. However, these small NPs are typically unstable and tend to migrate and coalescence to reduce their surface free energy during the real catalytic processes, particularly in high-temperature reactions. Therefore, a means to fabricate stable small metal NP catalysts with excellent sinter-resistant performance is necessary for maintaining their high catalytic activity. In this study, we have summarized recent advances in stabilizing metal NPs from two aspects including thermodynamic and kinetic strategies. The former mainly involve preparing uniform NPs (with an identical size and homogeneous distribution) in order to restrain Ostwald ripening to achieve stability, while the latter primarily involves fixing metal NPs in some special confinement materials (e.g., zeolites, mesoporous silica and mesoporous carbons), encapsulating NPs using an oxide-coating film (e.g., forming core-shell structures), or constructing strong metal-support interactions to improve stability. At the end of this review, we highlight our recent work on the preparation of high-stability metal catalysts via a unique interfacial plasma electrolytic oxidation technology, that is, metal NPs are well embedded in a porous MgO layer that has both high thermal stability and excellent catalytic activity.

Nitrogen Dynamics of Inundated Sediments in an Emerging Coastal Deltaic Floodplain in Mississippi River Delta Using Isotope Pairing Technique to Test Response to Nitrate Enrichment and Sediment Organic Matter	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Coastal deltaic floodplains; Denitrification; Coupled nitrification-denitrification; DNRA; Anammox; Sediment organic matter	ANAEROBIC AMMONIUM OXIDATION; INLET MASS-SPECTROMETER; MEASURED IN-SITU; WAX LAKE DELTA; REDUCTION PATHWAYS; FRESH-WATER; DENITRIFICATION EFFICIENCY; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS; ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE	Nitrate (NO3-) enrichment in rivers over the last four decades has potentially shifted how coastal ecosystems process nitrogen (N). Shifts in N dynamics may be particularly significant in coastal deltaic floodplains when sediments are inundated during river flood stage as this may change the fate of NO3- transported to the coastal ocean. We evaluated the relative importance of denitrification, dissimilative nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) in intact sediment cores of Wax Lake Delta (WLD) using continuous flow-through system. We manipulated this experimental system with two concentrations of riverine NO3- (lower concentration at 5 mu M and ambient concentration at 100 mu M) to test how nitrate-enriched waters may modify N cycling in coastal deltaic floodplains. Inundated sediments in a coastal deltaic floodplain removed bio-reactive N as a function of sediment organic matter (SOM) concentrations, indicating how N dynamics vary as a result of deltaic succession. Direct denitrification was the dominant N pathway in inundated sediments in WLD, which was several times greater than coupled nitrification-denitrification, DNRA, and anammox. Gross denitrification (direct denitrification + coupled nitrification-denitrification) rates generally increased with SOM concentrations and ranged from 4 to 12 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) under lower NO3- enrichment (5 mu M) and 68 to 276 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) under higher NO3- enrichment (100 mu M). Most of these changes in N fluxes with SOM and NO3- enrichment resulted from the increase in direct denitrification rates rather than coupled nitrification-denitrification rates. DNRA rates varied from 0 to 65 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1), and the relative significance of DNRA increased as a percentage of total NO3- reduction (%DNRA) with increasing ratio of organic carbon to NO3- concentrations (OC/NO3-). Anammox rates increased among sites as SOM increased, but rates were lower from 0.0 to 38 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1). The dominance of direct denitrification and increased anammox rates with SOM concentrations indicate that dynamic deltaic floodplains can permanently remove bio-reactive N in the proximal zone of river deposition of tidal freshwater wetlands.

Unlike conventional electrode materials which are gradually approaching their capacity limit, the emerging atomically thin 2D materials can potentially open up various new possibilities for design and fabrication of novel EES devices. The studies in this area to date have laid the groundwork in understanding fundamental physics and chemistry of 2D materials, enabling a toolbox of engineering strategies to be used to improve the EES performance.

In this work, the naturally occurring binder sodium alginate (SA) is functionalized with 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (ProDOT) via a one-step esterification reaction in a cydohexane/dodecyl benzenesulfonic acid (DBSA)/water microemulsion system, resulting in a multifunctional polymer binder, that is, SA-PProDOT. With the synergetic effects of the functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl, and ester groups), the resultant SA-PProDOT polymer not only maintains the outstanding binding capabilities of sodium alginate but also enhances the mechanical integrity and lithium ion diffusion coefficient in the LiFePO4 (LFP) electrode during the operation of the batteries. Because of the conjugated network of the PProDOT and the lithium doping under the battery environment, the SA-PProDOT becomes conductive and matches the conductivity needed for LiFePO4 LIBs. Without the need of conductive additives such as carbon black, the resultant batteries have achieved the theoretical specific capacity of LiFePO4 cathode (ca. 170 mAh/g) at C/10 and ca. 120 mAh/g at 1C for more than 400 cycles.

Electrochemical performances of two kinds of ternary electrolyte mixtures with lithium (oxalate)borate	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						LiBOB; conductivity; LiFePO4; LiPF6; cycle performance	PC-EC SOLUTIONS; SOLVENT COMPOSITION; ION BATTERIES; SALT CONTENT; CONDUCTIVITY; TEMPERATURE; LIPF6; LIBOB; CARBONATE; VISCOSITIES	Conductivities (kappa) of PC (propylene carbonate)/EMC (ethyl methyl carbon ate)/DMC (dimethyl carbonate) and EC (ethylene carbonate)/EMC/DMC solutions of lithium (oxalate)borate (LiBOB) were experimentally determined at a temperature (theta) range from -40.0 to 60.0A degrees C. Under such experimental conditions, the effect factors on the kappa, such as the salt molar concentrations (), and the volume ratio of solvent compositions, were also investigated. The results showed that, in wide theta range, the higher kappa were obtained with 0.7 mol L-1 LiBOB in PC/EMC/DMC and 0.6 mol L-1 LiBOB in EC/EMC/DMC and with a volume ratio of 1: 1: 1 and 1: 1: 2, respectively. When used in LiFePO4/Li cells, compared to the cell with the electrolyte system of 1.0 mol L-1 LiPF6-EC/EMC/DMC (1: 1: 1), LiBOB cells with PC/EMC/DMC and EC/EMC/DMC electrolyte systems with the same volume mixture solvent compositions exhibit several advantages, such as more stable cycle performance, higher mean voltage, excellent large current discharge capability, more capacity retention at high temperature, and more stable storage performance, etc. This study not only shows that LiBOB is a very promising alternative salt for lithium ion chemistry, but also provides appropriate solvent to improve LiBOB's electrochemical performance.

Parallelism of intestinal secretory IgA shapes functional microbial fitness	NATURE			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI; IMMUNOGLOBULIN-A; B-CELLS; HUMAN GUT; OMPC; EXPRESSION; ANTIBODIES; TRANSPORT; BACTERIA; DRIVES	Dimeric IgA secreted across mucous membranes in response to nonpathogenic taxa of the microbiota accounts for most antibody production in mammals. Diverse binding specificities can be detected within the polyclonal mucosal IgA antibody response(1-10), but limited monoclonal hybridomas have been studied to relate antigen specificity or polyreactive binding to functional effects on microbial physiology in vivo(11-17). Here we use recombinant dimeric monoclonal IgAs (mIgAs) to finely map the intestinal plasma cell response to microbial colonization with a single microorganism in mice. We identify a range of antigen-specific mIgA molecules targeting defined surface and nonsurface membrane antigens. Secretion of individual dimeric mIgAs targeting different antigens in vivo showed distinct alterations in the function and metabolism of intestinal bacteria, largely through specific binding. Even in cases in which the same microbial antigen is targeted, microbial metabolic alterations differed depending on IgA epitope specificity. By contrast, bacterial surface coating generally reduced motility and limited bile acid toxicity. The overall intestinal IgA response to a single microbe therefore contains parallel components with distinct effects on microbial carbon-source uptake, bacteriophage susceptibility, motility and membrane integrity.

Jefferson Lab Hall A Collaboration	Measurement of the cross sections for inclusive electron scattering in the E12-14-012 experiment at Jefferson Lab	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article							NUCLEUS SCATTERING; DELTA-RESONANCE; HALL-A; EXCITATION	The E12-14-012 experiment performed at Jefferson Lab Hall A has collected inclusive electron-scattering data for different targets at the kinematics corresponding to beam energy 2.222 GeV and scattering angle 15.54 degrees. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the collected data and compare the double-differential cross sections for inclusive scattering of electrons, extracted using solid targets (aluminum, carbon, and titanium) and a closed argon-gas cell. The data extend over broad range of energy transfer, where quasielastic interaction, Delta-resonance excitation, and inelastic scattering yield contributions to the cross section. The double-differential cross sections are reported with high precision (similar to 3%) for all targets over the covered kinematic range.	[Murphy, M.; Dai, H.; Gu, L.; Jen, C.

In this study, we focused on the immediate response to heat stress. Photosynthesis and volatile emissions were measured in the leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Wisconsin 38) after exposure to heat shock treatments between 46 degrees C and 55 degrees C. Exposure to 46 degrees C decreased photosynthetic carbon assimilation rates (A) by >3-fold. Complete inhibition of A was observed at 49 degrees C, together with a simultaneous decrease in the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII, measured as the F-v/F-m ratio. A large increase in volatile emissions was observed at 52 degrees C. Heat stress resulted in only minor effects on the emission of monoterpenes, but volatiles associated with membrane damage such as propanal and (E)-2-hexenal+(Z)-3-hexenol were greatly increased.

In addition, the oxidation of metabolites in the volatile profiles was strongly enhanced, suggesting the acceleration of oxidative processes at high temperatures that are beyond the thermal tolerance limit.

To understand the mechanism of Se deficiency-induced hepatic pathogenesis, a pure line pig model was established by feeding a diet with either 0.07 mg/kg Se or 0.3 mg/kg Se for 16 weeks. The hepatic metabolome, lipidome, global proteome, and whole transcriptome were analyzed. Se deficiency causes a redox imbalance via regulation of selenoproteins at both the mRNA and protein level, and blocks the glutathione antioxidant system along with enhanced glutathione synthesis and catabolism. The Warburg effect was observed by enhanced activation of the glycolysis and phosphate pentose pathways. The tricarboxylic acid cycle was dysfunctional since the preliminary metabolites decreased and shifted from using glycolysis origin substrates to a glutamine catabolism-preferred metabolic mode. The reprogrammed central carbon metabolism induced widely restrained lipid synthesis. In addition, a Se deficiency initiated inflammation by activating the NF-kappa B pathway through multiple mechanisms. These results identified the potential metabolic vulnerability of the liver in response to a Se deficiency-induced redox imbalance and possible therapeutic or intervention targets.

Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), X-Ray Reflectometry (XRR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to analyze the effect of different chemical precursors and behavioral factors on the performance of the Al2O3 thin films. The analyses disclosed that Al2O3 films prepared with a trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O (TMA + H2O) process contained more unreacted -CH3 groups, and the films with a TMA + O-3 process show a large number of carbon-based impurities. However, the Al2O3 films prepared using H2O and O-3 in turn in a deposition cycle as oxygen sources exhibited higher density and purity, leading to a superior water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) as low as 5.43 x 10(-5) g per m(2) per day estimated with the calcium (Ca) corrosion method at 40 degrees C/100%. The TE-OLED with Al2O3 (TMA + H2O + O-3) thin film as an encapsulated layer has longer lifetimes, and produces no black spots under operational times up to 400 hours.

Currently, marigold flower petals are the only commercial source for lutein extraction, since chemical synthesis suffers from very low yields. Microalgae cultivation is a promising way for lutein production, as the lutein content of microbial biomass is higher compared to that of marigold petals. In addition, microalgae are shown to have a higher growth rate, higher photosynthetic efficiency, and carbon mitigation potential when compared to terrestrial plants, such as marigolds. For the realization of microalgae as a sustainable and alternative lutein source, crucial factors such as the microalgal strains, critical cultivation parameters (light intensity, nutritional status, metabolic mode), pretreatment, extraction, and purification of lutein from microalgal biomass need to be studied in great detail. In this context, this review summarized the recent research progress in lutein production from microalgae, including competent microalgal strains, cultivation systems, and subsequent biomass treatment technologies. The choice of a high yielding strain, along with effective photobioreactor design will enable maximal lutein production from microalgae in an economically viable manner. This review presents comprehensive information on microalgal cultivation and pretreatment which will enable researchers to design an optimal microalgae-based lutein production system.

Inspired by the design principles of these materials, we provide pristine 2D conjugated MOFs (2D c-MOFs) as the alternative absorbers, without carbonization or hybridization. Beyond controlling the EM parameters of Cu3(HTTP)2 (2,3,6,7,10,11hexahydroxytriphenylene, HHTP), a 2D c-MOF, at the material level through regulating its mass ratio, we also fine-tune such parameters at the atom level by altering the metal center. Due to the improved dielectric loss, remarkably enhanced EM wave absorption is available among another three isostructural 2D c-MOFs M3(HTTP)2 (M = Zn, Ni, or Co). The strongest EM absorption of them can also be tuned from the C band to the X band and Ku band by adjusting the metal center. Co3(HHTP)2 has the best EM wave absorption, with a minimum reflection loss of -60.6 dB (99.9999% of absorption), and could against EMI in most of the Ku band (89%) which is wildly used in satellite communication, owing to the good impedance matching, and multiple loss mechanisms.

As the synthesis of epsilon-PL requires a rich supply of nitrogen, the efficiency of nitrogen translocation and utilization is extremely important. The objective of this study was to improve the production of epsilon-PL by overexpressing the ammonium transporter gene amtB in Streptomyces albulus PD-1. Using the recombinant bacteria, the optimum carbon-to-nitrogen ratio in the synthesis stage of fermentation increased from 3 to 4.71, compared with that obtained using the wild-type strain, and the utilization efficiency of ammonium was improved too. Ultimately, the production of epsilon-PL increased from 22.7 to 35.7 g/L upon fed-batch cultivation in a 5 L bioreactor. Determination of the expression of the genes and enzymes associated with ammonium metabolism and epsilon-PL synthesis revealed that the overexpression of amtB in S. albulus PD-1 enhanced epsilon-PL biosynthesis by increasing the activity of the corresponding metabolic pathways. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on enhancing epsilon-PL production by overexpression of the amtB gene in an epsilon-PL-producing strain.

The effectiveness of SAP was studied under three irrigation levels (adequate, moderate, and deficient) using a new type of negative hydraulic pressure-controlled auto-irrigator. Seven weeks after sowing (WAS), the number of tillers and leaves increased significantly by 33 and 40%, respectively, under deficient irrigation due to application of SAP. The SAP had little effects on shoot dry mass (SDM) and root dry mass (RDM) under adequate and moderate irrigation but increased both parameters significantly (59 and 45%) under deficient irrigation. As a result, the water-use efficiency (WUE) increased substantially (50%) under deficient irrigation. Leaf water potential (psi(1)) under adequate irrigation exceeded that under moderate and deficient irrigation by 26.4 and 39.6%, respectively, and the application of SAP further increased it by 7.2%. The superior growth and WUE of oat treated with SAP under deficient irrigation was ascribed to maintenance of greater relative water content (RWC) in leaves as well as intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci), net photosynthesis (P-N), and transpiration rate. It is suggested that the application of SAP is a suitable soil management practice for locations characterized by severe water stress.	[Islam, M.

Simulation Experiments on the Generation of Organic Sulfide in the Shengli Crude Oil	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						organic sulfide; mercaptan; sulfoether; thiophene	THERMOCHEMICAL SULFATE REDUCTION; RESONANCE MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ELECTROSPRAY-IONIZATION; SULFUR-COMPOUNDS; PETROLEUM; HYDROCARBONS; OXIDATION; SPECIATION; KINETICS; BASIN	Shengli crude oil sample was investigated using a comprehensive method to characterize and identify the formation and distribution of the organic sulfide. A full compositional model uses an autoclave on the system of Shengli crude oil and magnesium sulfate under high temperature and pressure conditions. Gas chromatography (GC) and microcoulometry were used to describe characteristics of gas phase products. The results show that the ratio of methane in the gas composition and the content of hydrogen sulfide improved by increasing temperature, which suggested that with the reaction temperature growing, the extent of the thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) process is deepened gradually. With the analysis of oil phase products by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and gas chromatography-pulsed-flame photometric detector (GC-PFPD), the distribution of organic sulfide can be detected in detail. The contents of organic sulfide especially as mercaptan, sulfoether and thiophene were detected by GC-PFPD. Through FT-ICR MS, sulfide species were characterized by class, type, and carbon number. The results show that, with increasing temperature, the content of mercaptan, became dramatically dominated, sulfoether and thiophene gradually increasing too. Types of sulfur compounds in the oil phase identified by FT-ICR MS are mainly S-1, S-2, N1S1, O1S1 and O2S1. The S-1 species are the most dominated. All of the results suggest that, as the reaction temperature is growing, the evolution process of organic sulfur compounds is originally changed from thiophene series to the benzothiophene series gradually and then to dibenzothiophene series. The products of solid phases were analyzed by FT-IR and XRD. The results show that the content of sulphur in magnesium sulphate decreased. This fenomenon demonstrated transformation of inorganic sulfur compounds into organic sulfur compound. According to the reaction model, the calculated activation energy is 57.91 kJ mol(-1) and the frequency factor A is 0.21 s(-1).	[Yue, C. T.; Li, S.

For high energy density and better safety, it is desirable but challenging to reversibly intercalate chloride in a graphite cathode because either the oxygen or chlorine evolution reaction can prevail over chloride insertion. The primary barrier is the lack of suitable aqueous electrolytes that suppress these parasitic reactions. Herein, we report an aqueous deep eutectic solvent gel electrolyte that allows reversible chloride storage for graphite based on a chloride-based electrolyte via the formation of iodine-chloride interhalogens. The results suggest three reversible steps: iodine plating on the host surface, oxidation to form I-Cl interhalides, and then intercalation into graphite. As a result, the graphite cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 291 mAh g(-1) with stable cycling performance. Facilitated by the same mechanism, a porous graphenic carbon delivered a record-high capacity of over 1100 mAh g(-1).

Thus, rapid, sensitive, selective, and portable detection of protein is in high demand for point-of-care (POC) testing. Here, a smartphone-controlled biosensor system is developed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to detect proteins for POC testing. The system was constituted by miniaturized biosensor, hand-held EIS detector, and smartphone, collectively. Printed carbon electrodes and interdigital gold electrodes, were modified with bio-components and integrated into the system as biosensors for protein detection. Then, detections of bull serum albumin (BSA) and thrombin demonstrated analytical performances of the system for quantification of the protein binding and enzyme activities by special antibodies and peptides immobilized on the electrodes. By the impedance measurement, the system could detect BSA and thrombin as low as 1.78 mu g/ml and 2.97 ng/ml, respectively. The results suggested that the smartphone-controlled biosensor system provided a portable and cost-effective platform that allowed integration of diverse biosensor formats for different kinds of protein quantifications for POC testing.

SBPH host-seeking behavior heavily relies on chemosensory receptors (CRs). In this study, we utilized genome analysis of the SBPH to identify 169 CRs, including: 133 odorant receptors (ORs), 13 gustatory receptors (GRs) and 23 ionotropic receptors (IRs). The phylogenetic relationships of OR genes from three rice planthoppers and other insect species revealed that the odorant co-receptor (Orco) Glade is the most conserved group. Among the candidate GRs, two sugar receptors and five fructose receptors have been identified but no carbon dioxide receptors investigated. Furthermore, we identified homologs of the three highly conserved IR co-receptors. The obtained results will provide us with precious information needed to better understand the interaction between insect pests and crop plants required for effective crop protection.

Functional loss of PAT14 resulted in precocious leaf senescence and its transcriptomic analysis revealed that senescence was dependent on salicylic acid. Overexpressing PAT14 suppressed the expression of SA responsive genes. Introducing the SA deficient mutants, npr1-5 and NahG, but not other hormonal mutants, completely suppressed the precocious leaf senescence of PAT14 loss-of-function, further supporting the epistatic relation between PAT14 and the SA pathway. By confocal fluorescence microscopy, we showed that PAT14 is localized at the Golgi, the trans-Golg network/early endosome, and prevacuolar compartments, indicating its roles through vacuolar trafficking. By reporter analysis and real time PCRs, we showed that the expression PAT14, unlike most of the senescence associated genes, is not developmentally regulated, suggesting post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms on its functionality. We further showed that the maize and wheat homologs of PAT14 fully rescued the precocious leaf senescence of pat14-2, demonstrating that the role of PAT14 in suppressing SA signaling during age-dependent leaf senescence is evolutionarily conserved between dicots and monocots.

Herein, we first devise a high-strength agarose gel electrolyte (AGE) that combines high toughness and super solution carrying capacity, for the construction of wearable AABs with high energy density, safety, easy assembly and greatly suppressed self-corrosion. The rigid AGEs convert the traditional Al/liquid interface into an Al/quasi-solid interface, thus leading to the formation of a Sn-dominated passivation layer that drastically inhibits the self-corrosion of Al. The in-depth failure mechanism study of AGE-based AAB coin cells demonstrates that three most critical factors affecting the discharge behavior of Al anodes are in order: H-2 accumulation, working current density and OH- replenishment. On this basis, the optimized largearea soft-package AAB (10 cm(2)) shows a 20.1-hour discharge duration and a specific capacity of 2148.5 mAh g(-1) (2766.9 Wh kg(-1)), outperforming those of the state-of-the-art AABs based on other gel electrolytes. More impressively, a practically useful wearable AAB pack is further prepared to drive the LED array and a smart phone.

Herein, polymeric layered semiconductor-supported black nano-sandwiches are fabricated by loading dense Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and then covering with Ag2O nano-layers (NLs). The Ag2O@Ag/g-C3N4 nano-sandwiches with improved broadband ab-sorption and thermal conversion possess both enhanced photo-triggered catalytic degradation and pronounced photo-thermal utilization for boosting PTC degradation efficiency. After one-sun light irradiation of 30 min, the nano-products enable the temperature of solution to be elevated from similar to 20 C to similar to 69.5C, which is higher than that of bare g-C3N4. In this way, the PTC degradation efficiency of antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) solution is about 8.1 times higher than that of bare g-C3N4 references. Moreover, the high-performance PTC nano-catalysts can be practically applied to the efficient degradations of organic or antibiotic mixtures in actual water samples. The present works highlight the distinctive synergistic effects of nano-sandwiches, promoting wastewater purification in the near future.

This study explored the growth behavior of supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2)induced fractures in layered tight sandstones through a series of laboratory fracturing experiments under triaxial stress states. Acoustic emission (AE) monitoring and computerized tomography scanning were performed to analyze the AE focal mechanisms and fracture geometry. The features of SC-CO2 fracturing were discussed through a comparison with the features of x-linked guar and slickwater fracturing. The influences of horizontal differential stress and pumping rate during SC-CO2 fracturing were also examined. Results showed that SC-CO2 likely promoted the dilation or shearing of bedding planes and natural fractures, resulting in a complex fracture network even under a high horizontal differential stress. Statistical analysis of the P wave polarity of AE waveforms indicated that the AE events associated with the SC-CO2 induced factures were dominated by shear failure. Most of the branching fractures induced by SC-CO2 fracturing were extremely narrow that they impeded proppant transport. For SC-CO2 fracturing, injection pressure (especially breakdown pressure) was low and likely dissipated as the growth of branching fractures. AE activities, indicating the fracture growth, more likely occurred when the injection pressure rose high (e.g., in tens of seconds before and after breakdown) or fluctuated remarkably. A large pumping rate was necessary to maintain high injection pressure which can open the branching fractures widely and persistently because of the extremely large leak-off rate of SC-CO2.

Future development of hybrid systems has been of particular interest for solar power enhancement with a minimized carbon footprint. Herein, a solar-powered water-electricity generator is fabricated via proper integration of a semitransparent photovoltaic (ST-PV) cell and an interfacial steam generator (SG). Taking the advantages of an inverted device structure, and controlled transmission and heat windows provided by ST-PV, the ST-PV/SG hybrid system simultaneously attains a high electrical power output of 122 W m(-2) and a stable water evaporation rate of 1.30 kg m(-2) h(-1) under 1 sun, which maximizes the total solar power efficiency (88.8%) and surpasses water evaporation of a single SG (82.6%). The performance outperforms a majority of emerging water-electricity production systems, where SGs are integrated with other energy conversion technologies such as thermoelectrics, pyro-piezoelectrics, salinity gradient power and so on. For the first time, this work combines solar-powered interfacial evaporation with a rapidly emerging class of organic PV cells and demonstrates one of the few highly efficient water-electricity production systems, scaling up solar power generation for reliable supply of drinking water and electricity.

Emerging atmospheric water generators (AWG) using desiccant materials enable active and efficient capture of atmospheric water even under low humidity conditions (i.e., relative humidity, RH below 40%). AWGs show strong potential for integrated technologies that benefit from solar-powered water desorption and reversible sorption-desorption cycles. Future development of solar-powered AWG systems is of particular interest for versatile energy-saving applications with minimized carbon footprints. Herein, a new sorbent-based AWG is developed via rational incorporation of marine polysaccharide, hygroscopic salt and photothermal polymer in a bead-like hollow structure, demonstrating reversible and durable water vapor harvesting. The desiccant beads attain high moisture sorption in a wide RH range of 35-90%, reaching maximum water uptake of 7.6 g g(-1) under 90% RH and outperforming a majority of sorbent-based AWGs. The AWG-integrated system delivers 3.14 g g(-1) of safe drinking water per night-day cycle, provides efficient humidity control in closed environments and boosts electricity production via photovoltaic cell cooling. This work provides a perspective on intelligent desiccant materials extracted from marine biomass and highlights their future opportunities in various energy-wise and sustainable applications.

The interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and the East Asian summer monsoon using RegCCMS	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						anthropogenic aerosols; East Asian summer monsoon; radiative forcing; air temperature; atmospheric circulation; precipitation	BLACK CARBON AEROSOLS; GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; REGIONAL CLIMATE; SULFATE AEROSOLS; OPTICAL DEPTH; SIMULATIONS; IMPACT; CHINA; RAINFALL; EUROPE	An online coupled regional climate-chemistry model called RegCCMS is used to investigate the interactions between anthropogenic aerosols and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) over East Asia. The simulation results show that the mean aerosol loading and optical depth over the region are 17.87mg/m(2) and 0.25, respectively. Sulfate and black carbon (BC) account for approximately 61.2% and 7.8% of the total aerosols, respectively. The regional mean radiative forcing (RF) is approximately -3.64, -0.55, and +0.88W/m(2) at the top of the atmosphere for the total aerosol effect, the total aerosol direct effect, and the BC direct effect, respectively. The surface direct RF of BC accounts for approximately 31% of the total RF of all aerosols. Because of the total aerosol effect, both the energy budgets and air temperature are considerably reduced in the region with high aerosol loadings, leading to decreases in the land-ocean air temperature gradient in summer. The total column-absorbed solar radiation and surface air temperature decrease by 8.4W/m(2) and 0.31K, respectively. This cooling effect weakens horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulations over East Asia. The wind speed at 850hPa decreases by 0.18m/s, and the precipitation decreases by 0.29mm/d. The small responses of solar radiation, air temperature, and atmospheric circulations to the BC warming effect are opposite to those of the total aerosol effect. The BC-induced enhancement of atmospheric circulation can increase local floods in south China, while droughts in north China may worsen in response to the BC semidirect effect. The total aerosol effect is much more significant than the BC direct effect. The East Asian summer monsoon becomes weaker due to the total aerosol effect. However, this weakness could be partially offset by the BC warming effect. Sensitivity analyses further indicate that the influence of aerosols on the EASM might be more substantial in years when the southerlies or southwesterlies at 850hPa are weak compared with years when the winds are strong. Changes in the EASM can induce variations in the distribution and magnitude of aerosols. Aerosols in the lower troposphere over the region can increase by 3.07 and 1.04 mu g/m(3) due to the total aerosol effect and the BC warming effect, respectively.	[Wang, T. J.; Zhuang, B.

Twenty-one RC beams were manufactured and externally bonded with carbon-FRP (CFRP) or glass-FRP (GFRP) sheets. Two U-shaped FRP anchorages were also applied on the ends of the beams to prevent end peeling failure. The FRP-strengthened beams were subjected to combined wetting-drying cycles in 5% NaCl solution and sustained loads for 0, 90, 180, and 360 days at load levels of 0%, 30%, and 60% of the ultimate loading capacity of the unstrengthened beam. During this period, the mid-span deflections and cracks of the beams were monitored, following which the beams were monotonically loaded to failure under a four-point bending. The failure patterns, mid-span deflections, and debonding loads were also examined. The WA results showed that during sustained loading, the time-dependent and residual deflections of the FRP-strengthened RC beams increased with the increase in their periods of sustained loading and load levels. Intermediate crack-induced (IC) debonding of the CFRP-strengthened RC beams was induced by concrete separation and CFRP-concrete interface debonding, whereas that of the GFRP-strengthened RC beams was mainly caused by GFRP-concrete interface debonding. Combined wetting-drying cycles and a sustained load had an adverse effect on the yielding and debonding load of the FRP-strengthened RC beams, and the ductility of the GFRP-strengthened RC beams was higher than that of the CFRP-strengthened beams. In addition, a model considering the effects of wetting-drying cycles and sustained loads was proposed to predict the debonding load of FRP-strengthened RC beams, and it showed a reliable prediction.

Here, a leather-based electronic pressure sensor and corresponding arrays with bidirectional sensing capability are demonstrated. The sensor/arrays consisting of two pieces of stacked leather both modified with acidified carbon nanotubes (a-CNTs) can achieve multi-level response to pressure over a broad working range and sense pulling force opposite to pressure. With polyurethane mixed with ferriferrous oxide (Fe3O4) powder being applied to their upper surface, the resistive sensor/individual units of arrays can also detect the magnetic field because of the contactless pulling force generated by the magnetized Fe3O4. Being able to sense pressure, pulling force and magnetic field, the leather-based electronic bidirectional pressure sensor and corresponding arrays with good performance not only exhibit potential for mass production and their broad application prospects, but also provide a new insight for the development of flexible electronics.

NX-3 for the production of exopolysaccharide welan gum. A high welan gum producing mutant, Alcaligenes sp. NX-3-1, was obtained through 20 keV N(+) ion beam irradiation. Starting at a concentration of 50 g/L of glucose, mutant NX-3-1 produced 25.0 g/L of welan gum after 66 h of cultivation in a 7.5 L bioreactor, which was 34.4% higher than that produced by the wild-type strain. The results of metabolic flux analysis showed that the glucose-6-phosphate and acetyl coenzyme A nodes were the principle and flexible nodes, respectively. At the glucose-6-phosphate node, the fraction of carbon measured from glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate was enhanced after mutagenesis, which indicated that more flux was used to synthesize welan gum in the mutant. By analyzing the activities of related enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of sugar nucleotides essential for welan gum production, we found that the specific activities of phosphoglucomutase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, and dTDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in the mutant strain were higher than those in the wild-type strain. These improvements in enzyme activities could be due to the affected of ion beam implantation.

Owing to their low reaction temperature, high activity, and high hydrogen selectivity, Cu-based catalysts are widely used in methanol steam reforming for hydrogen production. Cold spray is an efficient method for fabricating supported Cu-based catalysts for hydrogen production. However, in the cold spray process, the feedstock powder shape significantly affects the coating formation. In this study, we used two types of feedstock powders (consisting of dendritic Cu and clustered Al2O3) with different morphologies for fabricating Cu and Al2O3 coatings by cold spray on an Al substrate. A Cu + Al2O3 composite coating was also prepared by the cold spray method. The microstructures of the Cu, Al2O3, and Cu + Al2O3 coatings were investigated before and after methanol steam reforming. All the three feedstock powders were successfully deposited on the Al substrate. The coatings formed using the Cu and Cu + Al2O3 feedstock powders were multi layered and highly porous. Only slight deformation was observed in the micro-spherical structure of the Cu particle branches. In the case of the composite coating, Al2O3 particles were broken into pieces and were non uniformly distributed. The bonding strength between the coating and the substrate was strong enough. After the methanol steam reforming process, the quality of the composite coating improved; however, the Cu coating showed carbon deposition. In order to obtain high-quality coatings, special attention should be paid to the feedstock particle shape and deposition of easily broken feedstock materials. The microstructural investigation of such coatings can be useful for understanding their fabrication mechanism. The fabrication method used in this study can be used as a novel method for fabricating supported catalysts.

Ammonia working fluid with a high enthalpy of evaporation and large vapor pressure that is favorable for heat and mass transfer has been commonly used in ACs. Currently, promoting the cooling performance of ACs greatly relies on the exploration of high-performance adsorbent/ammonia working pairs. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been demonstrated as promising adsorbents for ACs using water or alcohol working fluids. However, the use of ammonia and MOF adsorbents in ACs is extremely challenging due to the difficulties in achieving ammonia adsorption performance and ammonia stability of MOFs. In this study, we evaluated the cooling performance of nine MOF/ammonia working pairs based on the ammonia adsorption data from grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, from which it was found that NU-1000/ammonia exhibited the highest coefficient of performance for cooling (COPC) of 0.58 and specific cooling effect (SCE) of 560 kJ kg(-1), while MIL-101/ammonia showed the highest SCE of 924 kJ kg(-1) and COPC of 0.50. Such a trend was further proved by experimental measurements. However, ammonia cycling measurements demonstrated that NU-1000 suffered from a severe reduction in adsorption capacity due to its ammonia instability. In contrast, MIL-101 displayed excellent recyclability in ammonia as well as outstanding cooling performance, suggesting its great potential in AC applications.

The energetic information is further refined at the UCCSD(T) and UQCISD(T) levels of theory. Our results indicated that the title reaction is more favorable on the singlet PES thermodynamically, and less competitive on the triplet one. On the singlet PES, the title reaction is most likely to be initiated by the carbon-to-oxygen approach forming the adduct IM1 (H2ICONO-trans) without any transition state, which can isomerizes to IM2 (H2ICNO2) and IM3 (H2ICONO-cis), respectively. The most feasible pathway is the 1, 3-I shift with C-I and O-N bonds cleavage along with the N-I bond formation of IM1 lead to the product P1 (CH2O + INO), which can further dissociate to give P3 (CH2O + I + NO). The competitive pathway is 1, 3-H shift associated with O-N bond rupture of IM1 to form P2 (CHIO + HNO). The theoretically obtained major product CH2O and adducts IM1 and IM2 are in good agreement with the kinetic detection in experiment. The similarities and discrepancies between CH2I + NO2 and CH2Br + NO2 reactions are discussed in terms of the electronegativity of halogen atom and the barrier height of the rate-determining process. The present study may be helpful for further experimental investigation of the title reaction.

In recent years, to improve the specific stiffness of the structure, the negative Poisson's ratio structure is combined with composite materials. In view of the phenomenon that the composite auxetic double-arrow corrugated sandwich panels (DACSPs) are prone to defects in the complex preparation, transportation and assembly processes that would seriously affect the mechanical properties of the structure, the mechanical properties of carbon fiber-reinforced composite auxetic DACSPs with and without defects were studied through theoretical analysis and finite element analysis (FEA) in this article. Based on the classical laminated plate theory and Mohr's theorem, the stiffness and Poisson's ratio of the structure are first obtained theoretically, which is verified by comparing with the numerical results. Then the defect coefficient is introduced and the effects of different coefficients on the mechanical properties of the composite auxetic DACSPs are systematically studied. Finally, under the premise of the same defect coefficient, the influence of different defect positions on the structural mechanical properties is also discussed. The results show that the stiffness of the structure mainly depends on the defect coefficient of the structure, and not sensitive for the relative position of the defect. However, the Poisson's ratio of the structure is mainly related to the defect coefficient and the relative position of the defect.

However, in such hole-conductor-free devices, the transport of the photogenerated holes is dominated by the diffusion-assisted charge carrier movement, while the driving force is insufficient. Reinforcing the built-in electric field (BEF) is an effective strategy to promote oriented carrier transport. Herein, by using an optimized two-step deposition method, the BEF is reinforced by creating a work function difference of perovskite (Delta mu) in different layers via a gradient self-doping. The enhanced BEF improves the hole transport and extraction, and significantly reduces the carrier recombination losses in the device. As a result, an average open-circuit voltage improvement over 60 mV and a power conversion efficiency of 17.68% are achieved without any additives or complex processes. This strategy provides a new approach toward fabricating highly efficient printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with reduced carrier recombination losses.

In the present study, cellulosic polysaccharides were extracted from sesame hulls before and after roasting at various temperatures (160, 180, 200, and 220 degrees C). The structural variations of the cellulosic polysaccharides were elucidated by using the techniques: scanning electron microscope (SEM), high-performance anion-exchange chromatography, Fourier transform (FT-IR) spectrometer, carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS C-13-NMR), and thermal gravimetric analysis. The pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) characterized and verified the chemical composition obtained from the polysaccharide degradation during roasting. The sugar analysis results showed that galacturonic acid, xylose, and rhamnose were more easily degraded than arabinose, galactose, glucose, and mannose. The morphology of the cellulosic polysaccharides shows irregular dispersed globular fragments after roasting by SEM observation. FT-IR and CP/MAS C-13-NMR spectra indicated the crystalline structure and linkages of the cellulose did not break down in comparison to amorphous cellulose that partly degraded. Abundant acetic acid and 3-furaldehyde were among the polysaccharide degradation products identified by Py-GC/MS. These chemical compounds were likely the significant contributors to caramelization and the Maillard reaction in sesame seed roasting.

Traditionally, taking into account the ionic conductivity, viscosity and dissolubility of lithium salt, the salt concentration in liquid electrolytes is typically less than 1.2 mol l(-1). Here we show a new class of 'Solvent-in-Salt' electrolyte with ultrahigh salt concentration and high lithium-ion transference number (0.73), in which salt holds a dominant position in the lithium-ion transport system. It remarkably enhances cyclic and safety performance of next-generation high-energy rechargeable lithium batteries via an effective suppression of lithium dendrite growth and shape change in the metallic lithium anode. Moreover, when used in lithium-sulphur battery, the advantage of this electrolyte is further demonstrated that lithium polysulphide dissolution is inhibited, thus overcoming one of today's most challenging technological hurdles, the 'polysulphide shuttle phenomenon'. Consequently, a coulombic efficiency nearing 100% and long cycling stability are achieved.

An aqueous supercapacitor (AqSC) is one of the most promising candidates for future high safety energy storage devices owing to the non-inflammability, non-toxicity, high ionic conductivity, low cost of aqueous electrolytes, and the high power energy and stability of supercapacitors. However, the low energy density caused by the narrow thermodynamically stable potential range of aqueous electrolytes is the main obstacle to realize the large-scale application of AqSCs. To fabricate high energy density AqSCs, an enormous effort has been made to extend their operating voltage in the past few decades. Herein, we review the recent progresses on designing high-voltage AqSCs, with the main focus on the mechanism of AqSCs, understanding of electrochemical electrode potential, and the recent strategies for extending the voltage window of AqSCs. First, the background, energy storage mechanism, and device configurations for AqSCs are summarized. Then, we move to the origin of electrochemical potential and the recent strategies for designing high-voltage AqSCs. This review also briefly discusses the challenges facing AqSCs and our perspectives in future research. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Identification of quantitative trait loci for dynamic and steady-state photosynthetic traits in a barley mapping population	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						Barley; dynamic photosynthesis; genotyping; mapping; phenotyping; Rubisco activation; sunfleck	RUBISCO ACTIVATION; STOMATAL RESPONSE; ANTISENSE PLANTS; REDUCED LEVELS; WATER-USE; LIGHT; CROP; LEAF; ACCLIMATION; INDUCTION	Enhancing the photosynthetic induction response to fluctuating light has been suggested as a key target for improvement in crop breeding programmes, with the potential to substantially increase whole-canopy carbon assimilation and contribute to crop yield potential. Rubisco activation may be the main physiological process that will allow us to achieve such a goal. In this study, we assessed the phenotype of Rubisco activation rate in a doubled haploid (DH) barley mapping population [131 lines from a Yerong/Franklin (Y/F) cross] after a switch from moderate to saturating light. Rates of Rubisco activation were found to be highly variable across the mapping population, with a median activation rate of 0.1 min(-1) in the slowest genotype and 0.74 min(-1) in the fastest genotype. A unique quantitative trait locus (QTL) for Rubisco activation rate was identified on chromosome 7H. This is the first report on the identification of a QTL for Rubisco activation rate in planta and the discovery opens the door to marker-assisted breeding to improve whole-canopy photosynthesis of barley. This also suggests that genetic factors other than the previously characterized Rubisco activase (RCA) isoforms on chromosome 4H control Rubisco activity. Further strength is given to this finding as this QTL co-localized with QTLs identified for steadystate photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. Several other distinct QTLs were identified for these steady-state traits, with a common overlapping QTL on chromosome 2H, and distinct QTLs for photosynthesis and stomatal conductance identified on chromosomes 4H and 5H, respectively. Future work should aim to validate these QTLs under field conditions so that they can be used to aid plant breeding efforts.

The polysulfide backbone of sulfur-containing polymers is known to bind mercury from aqueous solutions and can be utilized for recycling water. Increasing the surface area by electrospinning can maximize the effect of binding mercury regarding the rate and maximum uptake. These fibers showed a mercury decrease of more than 98% after a few seconds and a maximum uptake of 440 mg of mercury per gram of electrospun fibers. These polymeric fibers represent a new class of efficient water filtering systems that show one of the highest and fastest mercury uptakes for electrospun fibers reported.

An Ion/Molecule Reaction for the Identification of Analytes with Two Basic Functional Groups	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							ION-MOLECULE REACTIONS; MASS-SPECTROMETRIC IDENTIFICATION; N-OXIDE FUNCTIONALITY; GAS-PHASE; TRIMETHYL BORATE; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; RADICAL CATIONS; IONIZATION; TRANSACETALIZATION; DISSOCIATION	A mass spectrometric method is presented for the identification of analytes with two basic functionalities and PA between 222 and 245 kcal/mol, including diamines. This method utilizes gas-phase ion-molecule reactions of protonated analytes with neutral 1,1-diethoxyethene (DEE) in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR). A variety of protonated mono-, bi-, and trifunctional analytes containing different functional groups, namely, amido, amino, N-oxide, hydroxy, carboxylic acid, keto, thio, thioether, alkene, phosphite, and phosphonate, were tested in the FT-ICR. The results demonstrate that basic protonated bifunctional compounds (PA between 222 and 245 kcal/mol) react selectively with DEE by forming a specific addition/elimination product ion (adduct - EtOH) (this product was also observed for lysine with three functionalities). The diagnostic reaction sequence involves proton transfer from the protonated analyte to the basic vinyl group in DEE, followed by addition of one of the functional groups of the analyte to the electrophilic alpha-carbon in protonated DEE. The next step involves proton transfer from this functionality to the other analyte functionality, followed by proton transfer to DEE and elimination of ethanol. Since the mechanism involves proton transfer between two functional groups of the analyte, the reaction does not occur for analytes where the two functionalities cannot be in close proximity (i.e., meta-phenylenediamine), and where no proton is available (i.e., dimethylaminoketone).

Influence of inclusion size on fatigue behavior of high strength steels in the gigacycle fatigue regime	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FATIGUE			English	Article						high strength steel; S-N curve; inclusion size; gigacycle fatigue	HIGH-CYCLE FATIGUE; TESSELLATED STRESSES; LIFE	The fatigue properties of four high strength steels with same strength class but containing different inclusion sizes were investigated using an ultrasonic fatigue testing machine in the gigacycle fatigue regime. The fracture surfaces were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and element distributions at the crack origins were measured by an electron probe rnicroanalyzer (EPMA). The fatigue behavior can be divided into three categories: (a) The S-N curve displays a Continuous decline and the internal cracks initiated from the large oxide inclusions for commercial 50CrV4 steel in which the average inclusion size is about 29 mu m. (b) Step-wise S-N curves were observed for clean 54SiCrV6 and clean 50CrV4 steels in which the average inclusion sizes are about 3.0 and 2.4 mu m respectively. Most fatigue failures originated from the VC inclusion clusters at the lower stress amplitudes. (c) For clean 54SjCr6 steel in which the inclusion size is smaller than 1 mu m the fatigue cracks did not initiated from inclusions or inclusion clusters but from the region enriched with carbon. S-N curve shows that the fatigue failure hardly Occurs from 10(6) to 10(9) cycles, in other words, the fatigue reliability can be substantially improved in the super long fatigue life regime.

E Vacuum Wall Conditioning Grp	Vacuum and wall conditioning system on EAST	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article						Vacuum; Wall conditioning; EAST	HT-7	EAST is a non-circular advanced steady-state experimental device and the first entirely superconducting tokamak in the world. Vacuum system is one of the most important sub-systems of EAST device. Wall conditionings, such as baking, discharge cleaning and boronization, also play a very important role for the plasma operation. Due to Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequency (ICRF) wall conditioning technique could be carried out in the presence of a high toroidal magnetic field, it is routinely used for wall cleanings on EAST. After the 2nd campaign in 2007, the plasma facing walls was modified to full carbon walls and vacuum system was upgraded to meet the requirement of particles exhaust. This paper will introduce the new statues of vacuum system, such as pumping, fueling and wall conditionings on EAST.

Size-resolved aerosol chemistry on Whistler Mountain, Canada with a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer during INTEX-B	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							OXYGENATED ORGANIC AEROSOLS; BEAM WIDTH PROBE; AMBIENT AEROSOL; AIR-POLLUTION; TRANSPACIFIC TRANSPORT; HYDROCARBON-LIKE; FINE PARTICLES; NORTH-AMERICA; ASIA; EMISSIONS	An Aerodyne High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was deployed at the peak of Whistler Mountain (2182 m above sea level), British Columbia, from 19 April to 16 May 2006, as part of the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment Phase B (INTEX-B) campaign. The mass concentrations and size distributions of non-refractory submicron particle (NR-PM1) species (i.e., sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, chloride, and organics) were measured in situ at 10-min time resolution. The HR-ToF-AMS results agreed well with collocated measurements. The average concentration of non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1; 1.9 mu g m(-3)) is similar to those observed at other remote, high elevation sites in North America. Episodes of enhanced aerosol loadings were observed, due to influences of regional and trans-Pacific transport of air pollution. Organics and sulfate were the dominant species, on average accounting for 55% and 30%, respectively, of the NR-PM1 mass. The average size distributions of sulfate and ammonium both showed an accumulation mode peaking at similar to 500 nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter (D-va) while those of organic aerosol (OA) and nitrate peaked at similar to 300 nm. The size differences suggested that sulfate and OA were mostly present in external mixtures from different source origins. We also quantitatively determined the elemental composition of OA using the high resolution mass spectra. Overall, OA at Whistler Peak was highly oxygenated, with an average organic-mass-to-organic-carbon ratio (OM/OC) of 2.28 +/- 0.23 and an atomic ratio of oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) of 0.83 +/- 0.17. The nominal formula for OA was C1H1.66N0.03O0.83 for the entire study. Two significant trans-Pacific dust events originated from Asia were observed at Whistler Peak during this study. While both events were characterized with significant enhancements of coarse mode particles and mineral contents, the composition and characteristics of NR-PM1 were significantly different between them. One trans-Pacific event occurred on 15 May 2006, during which ammonium sulfate contributed >90% of the total NR-PM1 mass. This event was followed by a high OA episode likely associated with regional emissions. In total, three enhanced regional OA events, each of which lasted 2 3 days, were observed during this study. In contrast to the two dust events, the regional OA events were generally characterized with higher OA/sulfate ratio, less oxidized OA, and lower OM/OC ratio.

Although significant works have studied the influence of impurities in the electrolyte (e.g., metal ions), few studies have been performed to understand the influence of gaseous impurities in CO2 electroreduction. Herein, we study the effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on Ag-, Sn-, and Cu-catalyzed CO2 electrolysis in a flow cell electrolyzer in near-neutral electrolyte, representing a broad range of CO2 reduction catalysts. We show that the presence of SO2 impurity reduces the efficiency of converting CO2 due to the preferential reduction of SO2. In the cases of Ag and Sn, the effect of SO2 impurity was reversible and the catalytic activities of both catalysts were recovered. On the contrary, a shift in selectivity toward formate accompanied by a suppression of multicarbon (C2+) products was observed on Cu catalyst, demonstrating that Cu is highly sensitive to SO2 impurity. Our results suggest that CO2 obtained from direct air capture technologies or biorefineries could be more suitable for Cu-catalyzed CO2 electrolysis as these CO2 sources would be relatively cleaner (SO2-free) than fossil-derived sources such as power plants and can be directly coupled with distributed renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.

In this study, Mn2+ ion was introduced into a microwave-enhanced Fenton system for removing BPA in wastewater. The results showed that the BPA removal rate in Microwave enhanced Mn-Fenton (MW-Mn-Fenton) process was higher than that of in Fenton process or in other Fenton process with inclusion of metal under microwave irradiation. The effects of pH value, H2O2 dosage, Fe2+ ion dosage, Mn2+ ion dosage, initial concentration of BPA, microwave power and irradiation time on the degradation of BPA were investigated in detail. The optimum values of operating parameters were found at a pH value of 4.0, a H2O2 concentration of 34.0 mg/L, a Fe2+ ion concentration of 2.1 mg/L, a Mn2+ ion concentration of 2.7 mg/L, a microwave power of 300.0 W after 6.0 min of irradiation when the initial concentration of BPA was 100.0 mg/L. Under the optimal conditions, the removal efficiency of BPA and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) reached 99.7% and 53.1%, respectively. The BPA can be degraded completely at low initial concentration. The degradation efficiency for the BPA aqueous solution decreased gradually with increasing pH value was from 2.0 to 8.0. Less iron sludge was produced in short time and greater reagent utilization efficiency was achieved in MW-Mn-Fenton process in comparison with normal Fenton process. This study facilitates further research for practical application of the Fenton process in water treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This rhythm has a period of 22 hr in constant darkness (D/D). Under constant illumination (L/L), no rhythm is visible and cultures show constant conidiation. However, here we report that strains with a mutation in the vivid (vvd) gene, previously shown to code for the photoreceptor involved in photo-adaptation, exhibit conidiation rhythms in L/L as well as in D/D. The period of the rhythm of vvd strains ranges between 6 and 21 hr in L/L, depending upon the intensity of the light, the carbon source, and the presence of other mutations. Temperature compensation of the period also depends on light intensity. Dark pulses given in L/L shift the phase of the rhythm. Shifts from L/L to D/D show unexpected after effects; i.e., the short period of a vvd strain in L/L gradually lengthens over 2-3 days in D/D. The rhythm in L/L requires the white collar (wc-1) gene, but not the frequency (frq) gene. FRQ protein shows no rhythm in L/L in a vvd strain. The conidiation rhythm in L/L vvd is therefore driven by a FRQ-less oscillator (FLO).

Despite their importance, little is known about millennial scale changes in the SWW and how they have influenced the climate system in the past and interacted with the Earth's surface elements, such as dust, nutrients and carbon. Here we present a dust record from a 6.6 kyr old peat core in Amsterdam Island (AMS) situated at the northern edge of the SWW (37 degrees S) in the Southern Indian Ocean. Mineral dust flux was used to track atmospheric dust production, long-distance transport and subsequent deposition. Dust provenance was determined from rare earth element (REE) and Nd isotopic signatures (epsilon Nd) in the peat core, compared with a reference dataset of Southern Hemisphere dust sources. Using a multi-proxy mixing model, the eNd and REE ratios show a relatively uniform mixture of ca. 40% local, 15% Southern African and 45% Southern South American dust sources since 6.6 cal kyr BP. However, from 1910 AD onwards, there is a doubling in the contribution from Southern Africa (32%). Two mineral dust flux minima occur at 6.2-4.9 cal kyr BP and 3.9-2.7 cal kyr BP, interpreted as periods with equatorward-shifted and/or strengthened SWW at the northern edge of the wind belt. Conversely, periods of higher dust flux at 6.6-6.2 cal kyr BP, 4.9-3.9 cal kyr BP, and 1.4 cal kyr BP onwards are interpreted as poleward-shifted and/or weakened SWW. These interpretations are based on the findings that higher (lower) wind speeds lead to enhanced (less) removal of distal dust on the way to AMS, by wet deposition and turbulence. Published Holocene SWW records at the northern edge of the wind belt (33-41 degrees S) covering South-America, Southern-Africa and Australia, show much variability over the last 6.6 kyr. We suggest this reflects complex regional climate variability in the different SH longitudinal sectors, indicating that SWW are not zonally homogeneous at the northern edge of the wind belt. The recent shift in dust provenance is not accompanied by enhanced total dust deposition at AMS. We therefore suggest that human impact (e.g., land use changes) and drier climate conditions in Southern Africa have led to enhanced dust mobilization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At present, the mass concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O-3) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m and 2.5 mu m (PM10, and PM2.5) are used to evaluate air quality in China. A commonly used data-driven regionalization framework for studying air quality, identifying areas with similar air pollution behavior and locating emission sources involves an incorporation of the principal component analysis (PCA) with duster analysis (CA) methods. However, the traditional PCA does not consider spatial heterogeneity, which is a notable issue in geographic studies. This article focuses on extracting the local principal components of air quality indicators based on a geographically weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA) method, which is superior to the PCA with considering spatial heterogeneity. Then, a spatial cluster analysis (SCA) is used to identify the areas with similar air pollution behavior based on the results of the GWPCA. The results are all visualized and show that the GWPCA has a higher explanatory ability than the traditional PCA. Our modified framework based on the GWPCA and SCA for assessing air quality can effectively guide environmentalists and geographers in evaluating and improving air quality from a spatial perspective. Furthermore, the visualization results can be used by city planners and the government for monitoring and managing air pollution. Finally, policy suggestions are recommended for mitigating air pollution via regional collaboration.

J	Liu, CY; Zheng, HR; Hu, ZQ; Yin, W; Li, S				Liu ChunYan; Zheng HeRong; Hu ZongQuan; Yin Wei; Li Song			Characteristics of carbonate cementation in clastic rocks from the Chang 6 sandbody of Yanchang Formation, southern Ordos Basin	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation; densified clastic reservoir; carbonate cementation; substrate cement; genetic mechanism	SANDSTONES; DIAGENESIS; POROSITY; FIELD	Densification of reservoir is an important factor that restricts oil and gas exploration from low porosity and extra-low permeability reservoirs. Carbonate cementation was heavily developed in Chang 6 sandbody, a facies of underwater distributary channel in delta front, of Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation in Fuxian area, southern Ordos Basin, and the cementation is one of the major factors that affect quality of reservoir. Based on the macro-microcosmic petrology and geochemistry features, the genesis of densification of carbonate-cemented reservoir was systematically discussed. The carbonate cementation can be classified into endogenous and exogenous, and the essential differences between them are that they were formed in different fluids and in different diagenesis periods. With the aid of identification of thin sections, analyses on electron probe, trace and rare-earth elements, carbon and oxygen isotope, we propose that the endogenous fluid for cementation came from the rock itself during early diagenetic stage. The minerals related to endogenous fluid had good shapes. The reservoir property was enhanced with porosity increasing by 3%-8% because of later dissolution by endogenous fluid. The exogenous fluid might be water combining with CO2, likely released from organic matter-rich mudstone. Calcite cement, in form of substrate cementation, was precipitated from the fluid and filled in the remaining pores of sandstones in late diagenetic stage as variations of physical and chemical conditions. The exogenous cement reduced rock porosity, damaged reservoir property, affected some oil enrichment, and seriously caused Chang 6 reservoir densification. Some of the dense layers that formed on top of sandbody could have served as diagenetic traps, and thus the exogenous cementation area could be favorable for oil exploration.

Compositional similarities and differences between transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs) from two marine bacteria and two marine algae: Significance to surface biofouling	MARINE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Transparent exopolymer particles; Reverse osmosis; Biofouling; Marine; Bacteria; Algae	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; BIOFILM FORMATION; DESALINATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; RELEASE; BLOOM; SIZE	Transparent-exopolymer-particles (TEPs) have been recently identified as a significant contributor to surface biofouling, such as on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. TEP research has mainly focused on algal TEP/TEP precursors while limited investigations have been conducted on those released by bacteria. In this study, TEP/FEP precursors derived from both algae and bacteria were isolated and then characterized to investigate their similarities and/or differences using various advanced analytical techniques, thus providing a better understanding of their potential effect on biofouling. Bacterial TEP/TEP precursors were isolated from two species of marine bacteria (Pseudidiomarina homiensis and Pseudoalteromonas atlantica) while algal TEP/TEP precursors were isolated from two marine algae species (Alexandrium tamarense and Chaetoceros affinis). Results indicated that both isolated bacterial and algal TEP/TEP precursors were associated with protein-like materials, and most TEP precursors were high-molecular-weight biopolymers. Furthermore all investigated algal and bacterial TEP/FEP precursors showed a lectin-like property, which can enable them to act as a chemical conditioning layer and to agglutinate bacteria. This property may enhance surface biofouling. However, both proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and the nitrogen/carbon (N/C) ratios suggested that the algal TEP/TEP precursors contained much less protein content than the bacterial TEP/FEP precursors. This difference may influence their initial deposition and further development of surface biofouling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Li, S.; Winters, H.; Amy, G.

Aerodynamic characteristics, gas temperature and concentrations, furnace temperature, and boiler efficiency were measured for various secondary air mass flow rates. Under deep air staging, a steady central recirculation zone forms near the burner nozzle. With a decreasing flow rate, the swirl intensity and maximum axial, radial, and tangential velocities decrease; between X/D = 0-0.8, the velocity decay rate decreases, and the relative reverse flow rate decreases. In the early stage, the maximum axial mixing rate decreases; the primary air concentration increases slightly. A decrease in secondary air-box damper opening decreases the gas temperature and its increasing rate, generating a farther ignition position. In the initial stage, the O-2 consumption rate and CO concentration increase, while the NOx concentration decreases. In the later stage, O-2 concentration remains almost constant below 2%, and the CO concentrations exceed 15 000 ppm, which restrain NOx formation notably. Near the water-cooled wall, flue gas temperature varies slightly, and O-2 concentration exceeds 3%. Along radial direction 1.5364 <= R-0/D-0 <= 1.8708, the O-2 concentrations are below 2%, and CO concentrations exceed 6000 ppm. A decreasing damper opening decreases furnace temperature in the primary combustion zone slightly. NOx emission decreases from 833.4 to 769.9 mg/m(3) (6% O-2), unburnt carbon increases from 5.18% to 6.84%, and boiler efficiency decreases from 91.53% to 90.99%.

Nonetheless, the explored avenues are not conducive to mass production by far, and little attention is paid to the essence of separator regulation. Herein, a scalable Ti3C2Tx MXene-decorated Janus separator is designed by spray-printing MXene nanosheets over one side of commercial glass fibre (GF). The thus-derived MXene-GF separator affords abundant surface polar groups, good electrolyte wettability, and high ionic conductivity, which is beneficial to homogenizing local current distribution and promoting Zn nucleation kinetics. It is noted that MXene-GF displays adjustable dielectric constants with an optimized value of 53.5, offering a directional electrical field to expedite Zn-ion flux and repel anions. Accordingly, dendrite-free Zn anode equipped within symmetric cells can be achieved with MXene-GF, enabling a stable cycling for 1180 h at 1 mA cm(-2) and 1200 h at 5 mA cm(-2). More impressively, the assembled aqueous Zn-ion battery full cell with Janus MXene-GF separator realizes a favorable capacity retention ratio (77.9%) upon cycling for 1000 cycles at 5.0 A g(-1). This strategy with scalability and effectiveness offers a new insight into high-performance metal anodes.

Nitrogen deep placement mitigates methane emissions by regulating methanogens and methanotrophs in no-tillage paddy fields	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS			English	Article						Methane emissions; Methanogen; Methanotroph; Nitrogen fertilizer deep placement; Organic C fraction	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; IRRIGATED RICE FIELDS; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; N2O EMISSIONS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; FERTILIZER MANAGEMENT; AEROBIC METHANOTROPHS; CH4 EMISSIONS; GRAIN-YIELD	This study investigated the effects of placement of N at different soil depths on CH4 emissions and related microbial communities in no-tillage paddy soil. Five fertilizing treatments, including no N fertilizer, N surface broadcasting, and N deep placement at the soil depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm were applied in the paddy field. The composition of main microbial groups were determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. The absolute real-time quantitative PCR was applied to determine the abundance of the methanogenic and methanotrophic populations with mcrA, pmoA, mmoX, and mxaF as the functional gene markers. Compared with N surface broadcasting, the deep placement of N (i) significantly increased the microbial biomass carbon (C) and dissolved organic C by 7-90% and 6-75%, respectively; (ii) significantly enhanced the amount of the total PLFAs by 12-70% and the bacterial PLFAs by 15-82%; (iii) significantly mitigated the CH4 emissions by 6-39%; and (iv) significantly enhanced the abundance of the methanogenic and methanotrophic populations by 16-55% and 13-210%, respectively. The percent changes varied over a wide range due to different N placement depths as well as the seasonal variations. Moreover, structural equation modeling revealed that N deep placement directly or indirectly affected the CH4-related microbial communities through the increased labile soil organic C fractions by activating plant growth and soil microbial abundance, thereby mitigating the CH4 emissions in no-tillage paddy soil.

Such sandwich panels made of carbon fibre composite face sheets and aluminium alloy pyramidal truss cores are fabricated using an interlocking and adhesive bonding approach. Modal tests and quasi-static compression tests are conducted. A good consistency for natural frequencies, modal shapes and static stress-strain curves of the specimen with the same specification is obtained, which ensures the good repeatability of the present specimens. Considering the effect of strain rate, a series of split Hopkinson pressure bar tests combined with numerical simulations is carried out to investigate their dynamic compression responses. A good agreement between simulation results and experimental data is observed, which shows that the adopted split Hopkinson pressure bar testing device and the modified Johnson-Cook model are reasonable and reliable. Results show that the dynamic compression modulus and strength of specimen are strongly influenced by the relative density of the truss cores and much higher than the corresponding static compression modulus and strength. Furthermore, it is also revealed that all the specimens have excellent energy absorption performance, which may have greatly advantage in shock isolation application.

The effects of the concentration of ammonium carbonate, process pH, and feeding rate on the tap density and apparent density of cobalt carbonate were investigated. It was found that the apparent and tap density values of 4.4 mu m of cobalt carbonate were 1.27 g/cm(3) and 1.86 g/cm(3), respectively, when the initial concentration of NH4HCO3 solution was 60 g/L, the pH was 7.15-7.20, and the feeding rate of cobalt chloride was 2 L/h. The anisotropic growth process of the crystal lattice plane of CoCO3 under the aforementioned optimal conditions were studied. The results demonstrated that the crystal grew fastest along the (110) facet orientation, which was the dominant growth surface, determining the final morphology of the primary particles. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) results demonstrated that the primary particle morphology of the cobalt carbonate was a nanosheet. The unit cell of cobalt carbonate, of a hexagonal structure in the horizontal direction, grew horizontally along the (110) facet orientation, while 20-35 unit cells of the carbon carbonate were stacked along the c-axis in the thickness direction. Finally, the sheet-shaped particles were agglomerated into dense spherical secondary particles, as presented through the crystal re-crystallization model.

Herein, high-rate Li+ intercalation pseudocapacitance in organic molecular crystals is achieved through introducing weak secondary bonding channels, far exceeding their theoretical capacity based on redox chemistry at functional groups. The authors' combined experimentally electrochemical characterization with first-principles calculations show that the heterocyclic organic molecule 2,2 '-bipyridine-4,4 '-dicarboxylic acid (BPDCA) crystal permits a four-electron redox reaction at conventional -C(sic)O and -C(sic)N groups and a six-electron intercalation pseudocapacitance along conjugated alkene hydrogen bonding channels (-H2NC5-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISO(sic)C(OH)-) and heterocyclic aromatic stacking channels (-C5H3NMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISNH3C5-). The BPDCA electrode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1206 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and an exceptional rate capability. A 4.8 V high-energy/power-density BPDCA anode-based hybrid Li-ion capacitor is thus realized. This work opens a new avenue for developing organic intercalation pseudocapacitive materials via secondary bonding structure design.

Quorum sensing system plays an important role in regulation of mupirocin biosynthesis in P. fluorescens NCIMB 10586. In Pseudomonas, the RpeA/RpeB two-component signal transduction (TCST) system regulates quorum sensing system. However, the influences of the RpeA/RpeB TCST system on mupirocin production or other cell activities have not been studied. In this work, the homologous genes of rpeA and rpeB in P. fluorescens NCIMB 10586 were identified and inactivated in the chromosome, respectively. The deletion of rpeA reduced the mupirocin production from 160 in the wild-type to 21.3 mg/L along with slightly decreased cell growth, while no significant effected on mupirocin production in the rpeB mutant. Next, it was found that the RpeA/RpeB TCST system regulated the biosynthesis of mupirocin by modulating the quorum sensing system. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomics analysis was employed to detect the influences of RpeA on other cell activities modulated by quorum sensing system. Combined with quantitative real-time PCR, the results demonstrated that RpeA also regulated other cell activities including central carbon, amino acids, fatty acids, and purine metabolism. Overall, this study expands the current understanding of the RpeA/RpeB TCST system and provides several targets for increasing yields of mupirocin.

Morphology-Controllable Synthesis and Growth Mechanism of 3D-Hierarchical Pd/SnO2/Ni Foam (NF) as the Cathode for Al-H2O2 Semi-Fuel Cell	FUEL CELLS			English	Article						3D-Hierarchical Structure; Aluminum-hydrogen Peroxide Semi-Fuel Cell; Electrode; Palladium; Tin Oxide Nanorods	NICKEL FOAM; SNO2 NANORODS; PERFORMANCE; CATALYSTS; ANODES; ELECTROREDUCTION; PROGRESS; ARRAYS	A hierarchical 3D composite cathode (Pd/SnO2/NF) was designed and synthesized via electrode positing Pd nanoparticles on the nanoarrays consisting of SnO2 nanorods grown upright on the surface of Ni foam (NF). The influence of the adding rate of alcohol and the standing time of precursor on the morphology of SnO2 nanostructures was investigated. The growth mechanism of SnO2 nanorods was investigated and the influences of the morphology of SnO2 nanomaterials on the size and electrochemical properties of Pd catalysts were also discussed. The morphology of SnO2 nanomaterials changes from nanoclusters to nanorods, and both the diameters of the nanorods and Pd nanospheres decrease gradually with decreasing the adding rate of alcohol and prolonging the standing time of precursor. When the adding rate of alcohol is 0.022 mL s(-1) and standing precursor for 15 min, the SnO2 nanorods with a rutile structure are vertically grown on the surface of Ni foam apart, and Pd nanospheres are electrodeposited on the top of SnO2 nanorods. The formation of hierarchical 3D structure is benefitting for fully exposing the active site of the Pd catalyst and increasing the specific surface area of the electrode, further improving the performance of the Al-H2O2 semi-fuel cell.

From high to low, the average contents of REEs were as follows: Ce > La > Nd > Pr > Sm > Gd > Dy > Er > Yb > Eu > Ho > Tb > Tm > Tm. The LREEs in the south are more abundant than in the north, which is shown by the higher LREE/HREE values in south than in the north. This resulted higher values for the LREE/HREE ratio in the south than in the north. The mean enrichment factor (EF) could be arranged from highest to lowest as follows: Tm > Sm > Pr > Er > La > Lu > Ce > Tb > Eu > Nd > Yb > Gd > Ho > Dy. The EF indicates that pollution as a result of human activity was more serious in the southeast of the study area than in the north. The factors affecting the REE concentrations in this area include naturally occurring minerals and industrial pollution. Based on the spatial variation of upper continental crust (UCC)-normalized REE concentrations, the CSHI was classified into three geochemical provinces. The sediment of province I was controlled by the Red and Pearl rivers. The composition of the province II is mainly controlled by the Red River and the Pearl River, although some sediments have originated from the South China Sea Island. Province III sediments mainly originated from sources on Hainan Island.

It has been found that the calculated activity trend toward ethylene polymerization is consistent with experimental results. In comparison with species A, the higher activity of complex B is originated from the stronger interaction between the monomer and the catalyst in the chain growth process. The stronger interaction can be explained by the more positive NBO charge of the metal center and the smaller energy gap between the HOMO of ethylene and the LUMO of active intermediate (PI)-P-B. We also report a combination of multivariate linear regression (MLR) and DFT calculations to analyze and verify the factors affecting the ethylene polymerization activity of catalysts A and B. The trained MLR model features an R-2 value of 0.85 and a leave-one-out Q(2) value of 0.78. Strong correlations were found between the energy barrier of ethylene polymerization (Delta G(double dagger)) and the distance of the nickel-carbon bond (d(Ni-C3)) as well as the NBO charge (Q(N)) on the coordinating N atom in the transition state of the chain growth.

In this study, it is found that EPS from Pantoea alhagi NX-11 foliar sprayed at 20, 50, and 100 ppm could significantly enhance drought resistance of rice seedlings. The fresh weight and relative water content of EPS sprayed were increased. In addition, malondialdehyde content reduced while total chlorophyll, proline and soluble sugar content, prominent enhanced. Meanwhile, the antioxidant enzymes, CAT, POD and SOD, were also significantly increased. The drought resistance of rice was most pronounced at the 50 ppm EPS dose. For the sake of commercializing the gram-negative EPS-producing PGPB which were difficult to preserve, it is vital to improve the EPS yield. First, the carbon source, nitrogen source and inorganic salt were optimized. Subsequently, the effect of three oxygen vectors, which could increase the efficiency of oxygen mass transfer, on EPS yield was studied by response surface methodology. The maximum EPS yield (19.27 g/L) was obtained, which is 51.7% higher than the initial yield of 12.7 g/L. Overall, it may provide a new way for the industrialization of PGPB to increase the yield of EPS. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The experiments were carried out at five injection timings under medium engine load. Four fuels were tested in this work, D100 (pure diesel) was tested for baseline comparison, the other three fuels were DG (30% gasoline in diesel fuel by mass), DGB (15% gasoline and 15% iso-butanol in diesel fuel) and DB (30% iso-butanol in diesel fuel). Experimental results indicate that DG, DGB and DB delayed the ignition timing periods and shortened the combustion durations, resulting in higher levels of premixed combustion and maximum pressure rise rates (MPRRs). Meanwhile, DGB and DB showed higher brake thermal efficiencies (BTEs) than DG and D100. It was also found that adding gasoline and iso-butanol, substantial decrease in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, particulate diameters, nucleation mode (NM) and accumulation mode (AM) particle numbers were achieved, but the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were increased slightly. DGB and DB produced better NOx-particulate matter (PM) trade-off than DG and D100 in combination with retarded injection timing. Furthermore, PM emitted from blend fuels showed higher ratios of sub-10 nm particle number concentrations, the sequence is D100 < DG < DGB < DB, which may be more harmful to human health.

However, the low H-2 yield associated with fermentative hydrogen production process continues to hinder its industrial application. It is delectable that a maximum 3.9 mol H-2 per mol glucose was obtained in fed-batch fermentation mode with a butyric acid over-producing Clostridium tyrobutyricum mutant, which to our knowledge is the highest H-2 yield ever got in the fermentation process with Clostridium sp. This study aimed to better understand the change of flux profile within the whole metabolic network and to conduct the metabolic flux analysis of fermentative hydrogen production. For the first time, we constructed a metabolic flux model for the anaerobic glucose metabolism of C. tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755, and revealed the internal mechanism responsible for the redistribution of the carbon flux in the mutant strain in comparison with the wide-type. The MFA methodology was used to study the fractional flux response to variations in operational pH, and revealed that pH was a significant operational parameter effecting on the fermentative hydrogen production process. Furthermore, the presence of NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity in this anaerobe was demonstrated. By measuring the activities of related enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway of hydrogen, we thus concluded that the increased specific activities of both NFOR and hydrogen-catalyzing enzyme (hydrogenase) would be attributed to the hydrogen over-producing.

Although the current guidelines have provided different restrainer design methods, they do not adequately consider the dynamic interactions between the decks and columns in isolated bridge systems considering the flexibility of isolation systems. Additionally, due to a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) with a high tensile strength and shape memory alloy (SMA) with energy dissipation capacity and self-centering property, they are good candidates to be used as seismic restrainers. However, currently there is no appropriate design method for such restrainers in isolated bridges. The objective of this study is to propose a restrainer design procedure for simply supported bridges equipped with elastomeric isolation systems. Three types of restrainers, i.e., steel, SMA, and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) cables, are considered. The design procedure for restrainers is developed based on a linearized 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) analytical model. A three-span simply supported highway bridge located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, is chosen as a case study. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated. The results show that the restrainers could remain functional and limit the relative displacement within a design value during earthquakes. The effectiveness factor, defined as the ratio of the yielding displacement to the peak restrainer displacement, ranges from 2.0 to 6.4. The relative displacements of the bridge retrofitted with steel, CFRP, and SMA cables at midspan supports could be decreased by 41.6, 49.2, and 58.1%, respectively, compared with the allowable design displacement. The total length of SMA cable restrainers is the smallest, and they are more efficient in limiting the relative displacement compared with elastic restrain devices.

J	Niu, DX; Li, S; Dai, SY				Niu, Dongxiao; Li, Si; Dai, Shuyu			Comprehensive Evaluation for Operating Efficiency of Electricity Retail Companies Based on the Improved TOPSIS Method and LSSVM Optimized by Modified Ant Colony Algorithm from the View of Sustainable Development	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						operating efficiency; electricity retail companies; comprehensive evaluation; sustainable development; improved TOPSIS method; modified ant colony algorithm; LSSVM		The electricity market of China is currently in the process of a new institutional reform. Diversified electricity retail entities are gradually being established with the opening of the marketing electricity side. In the face of a complex market environment and fierce competition, the operating efficiency can directly reflect the current market position and development of electricity retail companies. TOPSIS method can make full use of the information of original data, calculate the distance between evaluated objects and the ideal solutions and get the relative proximity, which is generally used in the overall department and comprehensive evaluation of the benefits. Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), with high convergence precision, helps save the training time of algorithm by solving linear equations and is used to predict the comprehensive evaluation value. Considering the ultimate goal of sustainable development, a comprehensive evaluation model on operating efficiency of electricity retail companies based on the improved TOPSIS method and LSSVM optimized by modified ant colony algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, from the view of sustainable development, an operating efficiency evaluation indicator system is constructed. Secondly, the entropy weight method is applied to empower the indicators objectively. After that, based on the improved TOPSIS method, the reverse problem in the evaluation process is eliminated. According to the relative proximity between the evaluated objects and the absolute ideal solutions, the scores of comprehensive evaluation for operating efficiency can then be ranked. Finally, the LSSVM optimized by modified ant colony algorithm is introduced to realize the simplified expert scoring process and fast calculation in the comprehensive evaluation process, and its improved learning and generalization ability can be used in the comprehensive evaluation of similar projects. The example analysis proves that the comprehensive evaluation model proposed in this paper can provide scientific and effective evaluation results of the operating efficiency of electricity retail companies.

Glycine has been added as a rate promoter to 40-45 wt.% K2CO3 solutions to examine the enhancement of the CO2 absorption process. The laboratory scale pilot plant has been designed to capture 4-10 kg/hr of CO2 from an air/CO2 mixture at a feed gas rate of 30-55 kg/hr. Performance data of the absorber including pressure drop, holdup and CO2 removal efficiency has been collected from the pilot plant and presented for a range of operating conditions. The addition of glycine was found to improve the CO2 recovery rate by up to 6 times whilst also slightly increasing the pressure drop and holdup measured in the packed absorption column which is likely due to a reduction in the surface tension of the solvent. Additionally, increasing the K2CO3 solvent concentration and operating with a higher CO2 feed gas concentration were found to increase the CO2 recovery results. Finally performance data from the absorber has been used to validate an Aspen Plus simulation of the system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First, Pt, glassy carbon (GC), and gold (Au) electrodes were used as base electrodes for constructing ethanol biosensors, and the responses of these biosensors were compared. Second, The LbL films were formed by an alternate adsorption of poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and AOx on the surfaces of the electrodes. The results showed that Pt electrode coated with the five-bilayer (PDDA/AOx), film was the best one among the ethanol biosensors prepared. Third, the pH values and applied potential were studied. The performance of the optimized biosensor showed sensitive determination of ethanol with a linear range from 2.0 x 10(-4) M to 4.0 x 10(-1) M, with a remarkable sensitivity of 38 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), a detection limit of 3.0 x 10(-6) M estimated at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, and a response time of less than 10 s. The ethanol sensors could be used to determine ethanol in serum without any significant interference originated from electroactive compounds. The results showed that LbL deposition was a useful technique for AOx immobilization in ethanol biosensors fabrication.

However, the development of PIBs is hindered by the poor K+ transport kinetics and the structural instability of the cathode materials during K+ intercalation/deintercalation. In this work, birnessite nanosheet arrays with high K content (K0.77MnO2.0.23H(2)O) are prepared by hydrothermal potassiation as a potential cathode for PIBs, demonstrating ultrahigh reversible specific capacity of about 134 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), as well as great rate capability (77 mAh g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1)) and superior cycling stability (80.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1)). With the introduction of adequate K+ ions in the interlayer, the K-birnessite exhibits highly stabilized layered structure with highly reversible structure variation upon K+ intercalation/deintercalation. The practical feasibility of the K-birnessite cathode in PIBs is further demonstrated by constructing full cells with a hard-soft composite carbon anode. This study highlights effective K+-intercalation for birnessite to achieve superior K-storage performance for PIBs, making it a general strategy for developing high-performance cathodes in rechargeable batteries beyond lithium-ion batteries.

In order to optimize the use of fossil-fuel energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, finding effective ways to convert CH4 into fuels and chemicals has become a research focus in academic circles and industry. Activating the strong C(sp(3))-H bond (434 kJ mol(-1)) in CH4 under mild conditions is one of the most rigorous challenges. The use of a plasma for dissociating CH4 to CH3 free radicals has advantages over conventional pyrolysis approaches. This work aims to increase the CH3 production rate at low temperature by use of a nanosecond repetitively pulsed dielectric barrier discharge plasma with optimization of several parameters, including pulse rise time, pulse width and pulse repetition frequency. The maximum CH4 conversion reaches 31.9% when the pulse repetition frequency is increased to 9 kHz, while the dominant C-2 hydrocarbon is always C2H6 (from CH3 coupling reaction). A chemical kinetic model confirms that H and CH3 are the critical radicals produced from electron-impact CH4 dissociation, with their peak densities of the order of 10(15) cm(-3) and 10(14) cm(-3), respectively. The results indicate that the improved plasma technology can continuously produce abundant H and CH3 radicals, which would enhance the surface reactions on the catalyst in the plasma-catalytic CH4 conversion process.

The use of tires in vehicles consumes 6% of the world's energy and causes 5% of carbon dioxide emissions; it accounts for up to 10% of the microplastic pollution found in oceans. Here, a new rubber nanocomposite self-assembled from hard and soft elastomer matrixes is designed: polybutadiene with its two hydroxy chain ends reacts with 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate to form segmented polyurethane. This system first undergoes self-assembly, forming well-defined nanoscale hard domains distributed in the soft matrix. Then, cross-linking between the soft segments is accomplished by a controlled radiation method, resulting in the double network elastomer (DN-E). Remarkably, the DN-E exhibits the lowest reported loss factor value at 60 degrees C. The index of energy dissipation in the rolling tire demonstrates a prominent reduction of 72%, accomplished with an 88% decrease in energy loss, and 85% less wear loss, as compared with best earlier reported commercial tires. These new double-network materials open a new prospective for the design and fabrication of ultralow energy-consumption and strong abrasion-resistance elastomers, which establishes a milestone for the development of the next generation of green low-pollution tires causing much less energy dissipation.

However, little is known about the transcriptomic reprogramming of rapeseed in response to N deficiency. Methods Two rapeseed genotypes with contrasting N use efficiency (NUE) were used to perform whole-transcriptome sequencing on the shoots and roots supplied with or without N in a time-course experiment. Results A total of 24,435 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Among them, 8811 genes were differentially expressed between two N treatments and between the two genotypes. Coexpression networks reveal central N-deficiency-response modules with diverse expression patterns between the two genotypes. Major expression hubs involved in phytohormone signaling were identified and showed strong association with DEGs in each module. Genes involved in N uptake and assimilation, carbohydrate catabolism, amino acid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis were enriched between the two genotypes under N deprivation. In addition, photosynthesis and carbon assimilation declined under prolonged N stress, but starch biosynthesis was enhanced by N deprivation. Conclusions Our results revealed N-responsive genes and gene networks and expanded the knowledge of regulatory hubs in N-deprived rapeseed. The detailed gene information might assist the genetic improvement of NUE inB. napus.

This study was designed to compare the plant diversity, plant biomass, plant tottal cover across different types of grasslands on the QTP. The various relationships between plant diversity indices such as Shannon-Weiner, Simpson, Evenness, and plant biomass, plant cover and soil elements were examined through correlation analysis. Further investigation was performed to examine the plant soil fertility-plant biomass and plant cover-plant biomass relationship using simple linear regression. We found a weak positive relationship between Evennes index and plant biomass, while a positive relationship was detected between plant cover and plant biomass. We suggested that grassland types and grazing affected the plant diversity-biomass-cover relationships on the QTP. Soil nitrogen (N), carbon (C), phosphorus (P) and Magnesium (Mg) were positively correlated with plant biomass, suggesting that soil nutrients rather than plant diversity played critical roles in regulating plant biomass accumulation in alpine grasslands. For a comprehensive understanding of the interconnections between plant diversity, plant cover, soil fertility and plant biomass, more studies should be done to probe into these relations and hence make a decision along this path.

Laser Powder Bed Fusion of Ti-rich TiNi lattice structures: Process optimisation, geometrical integrity, and phase transformations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						Laser powder bed fusion; Shape memory alloys; Lattices; Phase transformations	SHAPE-MEMORY ALLOYS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MELTING PROCESS; MARAGING-STEEL; BONE INGROWTH; NITI; IMPLANTS; MICROSTRUCTURE; BEHAVIOR; SCAFFOLDS	The use of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) in fabricating TiNi-based lattices enables tailoring the mechanical and physical properties of the structure, in addition to the functionality associated with the shape-memory effect. In this work, TiNi lattice structures were fabricated using LPBF, following an optimisation study for LPBF parameters investigating the geometrical integrity of the lattices, microstructural evolution, and phase transformation behaviour. A process map for TiNi lattices was constructed to visualise the influence of LPBF parameters on the build density, elemental evaporation, and impurity pick-up. The optimum LPBF processing window was found to be similar to 60-90 J/mm(3) volumetric energy density, achieving > 99% relative density. Optimisation of the geometrical integrity of the LPBF-fabricated lattices, including the pore and strut sizes, was performed by considering the influence of the laser track width (LTW), beam compensation (BC), and contour distance (CD). As a result, when CD-BC = LTW/2, the deviation in strut size from the target design size was reduced to < 2%. The build microstructure was affected by LPBF parameters, where the dendritic cell size increased with the increase in LPBF heat input, also resulting in a change in the solidification structure morphology from cellular to columnar dendritic structures. The phase transformation behaviour was investigated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry to understand the effect of LPBF parameters on the formation of Ti2Ni intermetallics and impurity pick up (oxygen and carbon), and the resulting impact on the phase transformation temperatures.

Reconstructing Tonian seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 using calcite microspar	GEOLOGY			English	Article							NORTH CHINA CRATON; ORGANIC-WALLED MICROFOSSILS; U-PB; STRONTIUM ISOTOPES; EVOLUTION; SR; GEOCHEMISTRY; PROVINCES; RODINIA; MARGIN	The Tonian Period followed a long interval of relative stasis and led into the climatic -extremes and biological radiations of multicellular life during the Cryogenian and Ediacaran Periods, respectively. However, despite its pivotal situation, it remains relatively understudied, in large part due to the lack of robust age constraints. A combination of fossil evidence, radiometric ages, and isotopic constraints reveal that carbonate strata on the North China craton were deposited between ca. 980 and ca. 920 Ma, thereby filling a gap in marine archives. Here we present Sr-87/Sr-86 data from selected calcite microspar cements, which filled early diagenetic "molar tooth" cracks, along with data from demonstrably well-preserved bulk carbonate samples. These new data show that seawater Sr-87/Sr-87 rose in stages from similar to 0.7052 at ca. 980 Ma to similar to 0.7063 by ca. 920 Ma, after which a return to low values coincided with the eruption of the Dashigou large igneous province across the North China craton. We also present a new Neoproterozoic seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 curve, which reveals that the general trend toward higher Sr-87/Sr-87 during the Tonian Period was checked repeatedly by the input of less-radiogenic strontium from a series of eruptive events, both coincident with and prior to the main breakup of Rodinia. The weathering of Tonian volcanic provinces has been linked to higher carbon burial, glaciation, and oxygenation due to the high phosphorus content of flood basalts. Here we show that the weathering of major volcanic provinces affected material fluxes and ocean chemistry much earlier than previously envisaged.	[Zhou, Ying; von Strandmann, Philip A. E.

J	Dai, J; Li, S; Bi, J; Ma, ZW				Dai, Jing; Li, Shu; Bi, Jun; Ma, Zongwei			The health risk-benefit feasibility of nuclear power development	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Nuclear power; Health risk; Health benefit; China	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ENERGY; ACCEPTANCE; CANCER; UNCERTAINTY; GENERATION; ACCIDENT; PLANTS	Although nuclear power has gradually played an important role in world's energy consumption, there is still controversy because of the threat of releasing harmful radioactive substances. The public's incomplete understanding of nuclear power's risks and benefits has led to the Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) effects all over the world, especially in developing countries. It is important to analyze the role that nuclear energy plays for human society in a multidimensional manner. Previous studies have investigated the benefits and risks of nuclear power, which mainly focus on economic benefits, and carbon or pollution emissions reduction benefits. Quantitative study on the comparison of health risks and benefits has been lacking. By taking China as an example, we compared the health risks and benefits of nuclear power using a health impact assessment methodology framework. The results show that, under normal operating conditions, the maximum annual disability adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by a single nuclear power plant would be 2.2 h and 11.4 h in 2020 and 2030, respectively. In 2030, the DALYs of the population exposed for 8 h within approximately 80 km of a plant would be between 108 and 9199 years in a severe accident scenario. The health benefits of nuclear power were calculated by avoided DALYs of reduced SO2, NOx, and PM10 of coal-fired power substituted by nuclear power. The avoided DALYs would be 501.0-1658.1 years and 676.4-2942.4 years in 2020 and 2030, respectively. Considering that risk equals consequence multiplied by the probability, developing nuclear power is risk-benefit feasible. More precise risk prevention, control measures and emergency plans (for both normal operation and accident conditions) of nuclear power plant should be put into place, and risk communication should be strengthened (e.g., bringing the scientific-based risk-benefit assessment results to the public, etc.) to reduce the public's NIMBY effects.

Based on pilot scale trials, an innovative IGCC system with CC using hot K2CO3 solvent is proposed, in which the intercooling heat between CO2 compressors is recovered for CO2 regeneration (IGCC_CC_HR). Thermodynamic performance and exergy and energy utilization diagram (EUD) analysis are presented. Results show that recovery of the intercooling heat between CO2 compressors reduces the steam extraction requirement from turbines for CO2 regeneration by around 18% and enhances the efficiency of IGCC with CO2 capture (IGCC_CC) plant by 0.3-0.7 percentage points. With 90% CC, the efficiency of the IGCC_CC_HR plant is around 35.4% which is higher than IGCC_CC plant using Selexol technology. Compared to IGCC, the energy penalty for CC in IGCC_CC_HR plant is mainly caused by the exergy losses in CO2 separation (45.2%), water gas shift (WGS) (28.5%), combined cycle (20.7%) and CO2 compression units (5.6%). EUD analysis shows that the IGCC_CC_HR plant realizes good match of the energy levels between the intercooling heat and the recovered steam for CO2 regeneration, thereby obviously reducing the exergy losses in CO2 compression and separation units and improving the plant efficiency. The results presented in this paper confirm the sources causing the energy penalty for CC in IGCC power plant and the new IGCC_CC_HR system helps to reduce the energy penalty for CC in IGCC power plant based on solvent technologies.

However, the electrochemical performance of these PBAs suffers from insufficient activation and sharp performance deterioration. Here, the insufficient electrochemical activity and frame deformation issues in the CuHCF cathodes were investigated to enhance their specific capacity and improve their cycling stability. The high-crystallinity CuHCF nanosheets (CuHCF-P) with low-water-content were synthesized by a pyrophosphate-assistant co-precipitation method. It has a highly reversible 1.5-Na insertion/desertion capability with a specific capacity of similar to 120 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, which is the highest among all the CuHCF cathodes reported. First-principle study and XPS detection demonstrate that both Cu and Fe are redox-active centers in CuHCF-P cathode, which facilitates a high Na+ storage capability. And the decrease of water content in CuHCF framework increases Fe/Cu 3d-orbital occupy-sites, which activates both of the transition-metals. Furthermore, the full cells fabricated with as-prepared CuHCF-P cathode and commercial hard carbon anode exhibit excellent performances with a reversible capacity of 109 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C over 200 cycles.

To have a better understanding of thermochemical properties of NH3, accurate in situ detection of NH3 in high temperature environments is desirable. Ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy is a feasible technique. To achieve quantitative measurements, spectrally resolved UV absorption cross-sections of NH3 in hot gas environments at different temperatures from 295 K to 590 K were experimentally measured for the first time. Based on the experimental results, vibrational constants of NH3 were determined and used for the calculation of the absorption cross-section of NH3 at high temperatures above 590 K using the PGOPHER software. The investigated UV spectra covered the range of wavelengths from 190 nm to 230 nm, where spectral structures of the (A) over tilde (1)A(2)'' <- (X) over tilde (1) A(1)' transition of NH3 in the umbrella bending mode, v(2), were recognized. The absorption cross-section was found to decrease at higher temperatures. For example, the absorption cross-section peak of the (6, 0) vibrational band of NH3 decreases from similar to 2 x 10(-17) to similar to 0.5 x 10(-17) cm(2)/molecule with the increase of temperature from 295 K to 1570 K. Using the obtained absorption cross-section, in situ nonintrusive quantification of NH3 in different hot gas environments was achieved with a detection limit varying from below 10 parts per million (ppm) to around 200 ppm as temperature increased from 295 K to 1570 K. The quantitative measurement was applied to an experimental investigation of NH3 combustion process. The concentrations of NH3 and nitric oxide (NO) in the post flame zone of NH3-methane (CH4)-air premixed flames at different equivalence ratios were measured.

While productivity increased with community-weighted mean trait values early on, after 7 years productivity was significantly increased in plots with higher functional diversity. Forest restoration increases global forest area and ecosystem services such as primary productivity and carbon storage. How tree species functional composition impacts the provisioning of these services as forests develop is sparsely studied. We used 10-year data from 478 plots with 191,200 trees in a forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China to assess the relationship between community productivity and community-weighted mean (CWM) or functional diversity (FD) values of 38 functional traits. We found that effects of FD values on productivity became larger than effects of CWM values after 7 years of forest development and that the FD values also became more reliable predictors of productivity than the CWM values. In contrast to CWM, FD values consistently increased productivity across ten different species-pool subsets. Our results imply that to promote productivity in the long term it is imperative for forest restoration projects to plant multispecies communities with large functional diversity.

In this study, experimental research was employed to characterize the freeze-thaw behavior of mixed fiber-reinforced geo -polymer mortars. Modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with mass fractions of 0.05%, 0.10% and 0.15% and PVA fibers with volume fractions of 1.50%, 2.00% and 2.5% were used as the experimental pa-rameters. The geopolymer mortar without modified MWCNTs and PVA fibers was used as the control. Visual inspection, relative dynamic elasticity modulus and mass loss were adopted to evaluate the resistance against freeze-thaw cycles of mixed fiber reinforced geopolymer mortars. The freeze-thaw damage model was built on the basis of the freeze-thaw cycles and the relative dynamic elasticity modulus. In addition, the pore structure characteristics and the micro-morphology were characterized by means of mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The experimental results show that the control geopolymer mortar is destroyed in 50 freeze-thaw cycles, while the mixed fiber reinforced geopolymer mortar incorporated with 0.10% modified MWCNTs and 2.00% PVA fibers can withstand 175 freeze-thaw cycles. Meanwhile, the mechanism of freeze-thaw failure and improvement of geopolymer mortars were revealed from microscopic and mesoscopic aspects. The MIP analysis can well establish that the utilization of modified MWCNTs and PVA fibers is an effective way to decrease the porosity of geopolymer mortars. The nano-nucleation effect, nano-filling effect, crack arrest effect and mechanical interlocking effect of modified MWCNTs make geopolymer mortars denser, decreasing the percentage of the capillary pore. The mechanical interlocking effect of PVA fibers ounterbalances the internal stress, which is caused by freezing the water.

The KMA aircraft platform has been established for regular observations of greenhouse gases including CH4 since 2018. For KORUS-AQ campaign, 37% of the observations show well correlations (R-2 > 0.4) between CH4 and C2H6, and the slope of CH4/C2H6 showed the different levels according to the flying regions. The samples observed from Seoul, Busan megacity showed the slope with about 53 ppb/ppb, which seems to be associated with fossil fuel related emissions sources. But the slope of CH4/C2H6 in the vicinity of industrial regions in west coast and Jeolla-do showed a range of 150 similar to 250 ppb/ppb, suggesting the significant CH4 contributions by biogenic emissions. KMA aircraft observed slope of CH4/CO showed a range of 0.1 similar to 0.4 ppb/ppb in January and April, but in summer it showed a range of 0.4 similar to 2.5 ppb/ppb mainly at vicinity of Jeolla-do (34 similar to 35.5 degrees N), suggesting the dominant biogenic emissions contributions of CH4 as well. From the KORUS-AQ campaign and KMA regular aircraft observations, we confirmed the significant contributions of CH4 from biogenic emissions in summer and fossil fuel in other seasons. We will analyze with integrated long-term data in further study to understand CH4 characteristics and support the policy for carbon neutral in 2050.

Herein, a temperature-controlled annealing process is introduced to fabricate Ni-MOFs/V2CTx-MXene (T-x denotes the surface groups, -O, -OH, and -F) composites on Ni foam (NF) (namely MOF/MXene/NF) and subsequently build the heterogeneous structure of a hierarchically-porous nanorod composite without a change in the crystalline structure. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that Ni-O-V bridging bonds are constructed at the Ni-MOF and V2CTx interfaces, which could be used to establish a favorable electronic structure in promoting conductivity and reactivity. The optimized MOF/MXene/NF electrode obtained at 300 degrees C (i.e., MOF/MXene/NF-300) delivers an ultrahigh specific capacity of 1103.9 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). The as-assembled hybrid supercapacitor, composed of MOF/MXene/NF-300 as the cathode and activated carbon/NF as the anode, delivers a high energy density of 46.3 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 746.8 W kg(-1) and an outstanding cycling stability of ca. 118.1% capacity retention after 15 000 cycles. Such an achievement stems from the strong chemical bonds at the interface and unique porous morphology. This work suggests a new avenue for designing and preparing robust and high-performance electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors.

Jefferson Lab Hall Collaboration	First measurement of the Ar(e, e ')X cross section at Jefferson Laboratory	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article							SCATTERING	The success of the ambitious programs of both long- and short-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiments employing liquid-argon time-projection chambers will greatly rely on the precision with which the weak response of the argon nucleus can be estimated. In the E12-14-012 experiment at Jefferson Lab Hall A, we studied the properties of the argon nucleus by scattering a high-quality electron beam off a high-pressure gaseous argon target. Here, we present the measured Ar-40(e, e') double differential cross section at incident electron energy E = 2.222 GeV and scattering angle theta = 15.54 degrees. The data cover a broad range of energy transfers, where quasielastic scattering and delta production are the dominant reaction mechanisms. The result for argon is compared to our previously reported cross sections for titanium and carbon, obtained in the same kinematical setup.	[Dai, H.; Murphy, M.; Pandey, V; Jen, C.

All isomers of these phenyl substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been identified in the m/z 254 mass chromatograms by comparison of the mass spectra and standard retention indices with those published elsewhere. The 2,2'-binaphtyl/1,2'-binaphthyl ratio values show a linear increase with increasing maturity, and have a good correlation with T-max (degrees C). Therefore, they can be used as an effective maturity indictor for source rocks in this study. In the main phase of the oil generation window, the 3-phenylphenanthrene and 2-phenylphenanthrene prevail over other isomers, and some thermodynamically unstable isomers including all phenylanthracenes, 4-phenylphenanthrene and 1,1'-binaphthyl are present at very low concentrations or below the detection limit in the m/z 254 mass chromatograms. The absolute concentrations of individual phenylphenanthrene and binaphthyl isomers were obtained by comparison of the peak areas with that of internal standard phenanthrene-d10. All isomers are present at low concentrations at low maturity stages and then show an abrupt increase at a depth of approximate to 3100 m, corresponding to the onset of the intensive C15+ hydro-carbon generation. The Phenylphenanthrene Ratio (2-+ 3-PhP)/[(2-+ 3-PhP) + (4-+ 1-+ 9-PhP)] shows a reverse change with increasing maturity at the low maturity stage. It displays a drastic increase at a depth of approximate to 3100 m and then remains at a nearly constant value. This study can expand the understanding of the formation and distribution of phenyl substituted PAHs in sedimentary organic matter deposited in various environments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

BET, XRD, H-2-TPR, and MES were conducted to characterize the phases, structure, morphology, reducibility and carbonization characteristics of the catalysts. It was observed that the reduced catalysts under syngas(H-2/CO = 5) promoted with Al/Zr generate more Fe5C2 phase than Si/Ti, which showed that Al/Zr promoted catalysts are more easily reduced than the Si/Ti promoted ones. Addition of Zr and Al promoters improved the reduction and carbonization process of iron-based FTS catalysts. FTS performance data showed that the addition of Al and Zr can increase the CO hydrogenation activity compared to Si and Ti. Moreover, these two promoted catalysts also exhibited excellent stability.

In this work, the effects of O-2, SO2, and NO on arsenic adsorption over a Cu/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst were calculated via density functional theory (DFT) method. Results revealed that O-2 facilitated the As2O3 retention on Cu/gamma-Al2O3 surface due to the formation of adsorbed O atoms. The positive effect of SO2 on As2O3 adsorption was reflected by the formation of SO42 and HSO4, which changed the potential field of substrate surface. Specifically, HSO4 enhanced the adsorption activities of surface atoms. However, NO3 did not show a significant impact on As2O3 adsorption when NO was introduced. From thermodynamic and adsorption selectivity analysis, the adsorption activities of different surfaces were in the order of O-Cu/gamma-Al2O3 > SO42-Cu/gamma-Al2O3 > O-2-Cu/gamma-Al2O3 > NO3-Cu/gamma-Al2O3 > HSO4-Cu/gamma-Al2O3. However, the adsorption selectivity weakened with increasing temperature. Results from this work can help improve the arsenic resistance of SCR catalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, engineering a continuous CO2-selective microporous network to achieve ultrahigh gas permeance and desirable selectivity remains a grand challenge. Aiming to manipulate the pore architecture and pore chemistry to implement efficient separation, knitted microporous polymer membranes are fabricated by in situ knitting composite membranes comprised of polyphenylene oxide (PPO) polymer and benzyl alcohol (BnOH). Specifically, the crosslinkers, formaldehyde dimethylacetal, bridge the neighboring aromatic backbones of PPO chains and BnOH to construct a highly crosslinked network with microporosity. By increasing the structural bridge density, the BET surface area of membranes increases from 4 to 538 m(2) g(-1). The formation of a highly interconnected microporous network provides remarkably increased permeability. Meanwhile, BnOH as a hydroxyl-containing functional building unit is knitted into micropore skeletons, which can directly tune the pore size and improve the CO2-philicity for enhanced selectivity. The resulting membrane displays an ultrahigh permeability of 4651.2 barrer with a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 27, and demonstrated good resistance to plasticization (up to 30 bar) and aging (for 190 days). This knitting strategy enabling versatile combination of building units with different structures and special functionalities may set up an innovative platform for fabricating a broad range of advanced membranes.

The MD was used to explore stretch and break of molecular chains for understanding the inherent mechanism of nanocomposites. The results found that elastic modulus of PTFE and PTFE/ZrO2 were 1.42 GPa and 6.43 GPa, respectively. The average friction coefficients of PTFE and PTFE/ZrO2 were 0.168 and 0.113, respectively. Compared to PTFE, the friction coefficient of PTFE/ZrO2 decreased by 32.7%. To explore the microscopic friction mechanism, the radial distribution function, atomic concentration, and atomic velocity were simulated and interpreted accordingly during the tribological process.

Previously, our molecular dynamic (MD) simulation work identified that there exists a Y-shaped tunnel system hosted in the Ns H-NOX interior, which servers for ligand migration. The tunnels were then confirmed by Winter et al. [PNAS 2011;108(43):E 881-889] recently using x-ray crystallography with xenon pressured conditions. In this work, to further investigate how the protein matrix of Ns H-NOX modulates the ligand migration process and how the distal residue composition affects the ligand binding prosperities, the free energy profiles for nitric oxide (NO), carbon monooxide (CO), and O-2 migration are explored using the steered MDs simulation and the ligand binding energies are calculated using QM/MM schemes. The potential of mean force profiles suggest that the longer branch of the tunnel would be the most favorable route for NO migration and a second NO trapping site other than the distal heme pocket along this route in the Ns H-NOX was identified. On the contrary, CO and O-2 would prefer to diffuse via the shorter branch of the tunnel. The QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations suggest that the hydrophobic distal pocket of Ns H-NOX would provide an approximately vacuum environment and the ligand discrimination would be determined by the intrinsic binding properties of the diatomic gas ligand to the heme group.

But the mechanism of HXD degradation remains unclear. This work mainly aimed to study the degradation of HXD by Aspergillus sp. RFC-1 obtained from oil contaminated soil. The HXD content, medium acidification and presence of hexadecanoic acid in the medium were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and fungal growth was observed. Enzyme and gene expression assays suggested the involvement of an alkane hydroxylase, an alcohol dehydrogenase, and a P450 enzyme system in HXD degradation. A biosurfactant produced by the strain RFC-1 was also characterized. During 10 days of incubation, 86.3% of HXD was degraded by RFC-1. The highest activities of alkane hydroxylase (125.4 mu mol mg(-1) protein) and alcohol dehydrogenase (12.5 mu mol mg(-1) proteins) were recorded. The expression level of cytochrome P450 gene associated with oxidation was induced (from 0.94-fold to 5.45-fold) under the HXD condition by Real-time PCR analysis. In addition, HXD accumulated in inclusion bodies of RFC-1 with the maximum of 5.1 g L-1. Results of blood agar plate and thin-layer chromatography analysis showed RFC-1 released high lipid and emulsification activity in the fungal culture. Induced cell surface hydrophobicity and reduced surface tension also indicated the RFC-1-mediated biosurfactant production, which facilitated the HXD degradation and supported the degradation process.

Herein, an exquisite triphasic interfacial structure featuring the encapsulation of FexNi alloy in a graphitic shell with a partial exposure of the FeOy thin-layered surface is manipulated via an electronic modulation strategy. The spontaneous integration of well-crystallized metal alloy, carbon shell with a tunable active FeOy layer, not only guarantees smooth charge transfer across the thin oxide layer, but also generates the synergistic effect at the interface, thus dramatically boosting the intrinsic activity of oxygen catalysis. Benefiting from these attributes, the hybrid catalyst outperforms the commercial noble-metal benchmarks with a higher half-wave potential of 0.890 V for oxygen reduction reaction and lower overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Beyond that, a high-performance rechargeable Zn-air battery is realized with a narrow voltage gap of 0.742 V and excellent cyclability over 500 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating the great potential of the as-developed triphasic electrocatalyst for practical applications.

In those studies enhancers with n-alkyl chain lengths of eight or less were investigated. In order to investigate enhancers with longer n-alkyl chain lengths, enhancer-solubilizing agents should be considered. Corticosterone (CS) flux enhancement along the lipoidal pathway of hairless mouse skin (HMS) was determined with the enhancers 1-hexyl- (HP), 1-octyl- (OP), 1-decyl- (DP), and 1-dodecyl-2-pyrrolidone (DoP) solubilized in 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol-2000] (DSPE) micelles or in hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD). The free CS, HP, OP, DP, and DoP aqueous concentrations in the DSPE micelle and HP beta CD systems were determined using a partitioning method. Comparisons of the enhancer potencies based on the free concentration of the enhancers revealed a nearly semi-logarithmic linear relationship between enhancer potency and the carbon number of the alkyl chain length with a slope of similar to 0.55. The observed n-alkyl chain length dependency in the aqueous phase is consistent with the hydrophobic effect. This study shows that longer chain enhancers may be studied by employing a solubilizing system, and free enhancer concentration in these systems can be determined with the aid of the silicone elastomer uptake method.

To test whether this result can be extrapolated to forests, the main contributors to terrestrial primary productivity, requires large-scale experiments. We manipulated tree species richness by planting more than 150,000 trees in plots with 1 to 16 species. Simulating multiple extinction scenarios, we found that richness strongly increased stand-level productivity. After 8 years, 16-species mixtures had accumulated over twice the amount of carbon found in average monocultures and similar amounts as those of two commercial monocultures. Species richness effects were strongly associated with functional and phylogenetic diversity. A shrub addition treatment reduced tree productivity, but this reduction was smaller at high shrub species richness. Our results encourage multispecies afforestation strategies to restore biodiversity and mitigate climate change.

J	Li, S; Jin, HG; Gao, L				Li, Sheng; Jin, Hongguang; Gao, Lin			Cogeneration of substitute natural gas and power from coal by moderate recycle of the chemical unconverted gas	ENERGY			English	Article						Polygeneration/cogeneration; Substitute/synthetic natural gas; Gasification; Modeling and simulation; Thermodynamic analysis; Optimization	PROCESS DESIGN; GASIFICATION; HYDROGEN; SIMULATION	The thermodynamic analysis and the coupling and optimization between chemical synthesis and power generation in a polygeneration system are presented. Unlike full conversion of syngas into chemicals in the traditional SNG (synthetic natural gas) production system, by moderate conversion the sharp increase in energy consumption for SNG synthesis can be avoided in the new system. Also, by recovering the chemical unconverted gas for combined cycle, electricity is cogenerated efficiently. Results show that the overall efficiency of the novel system can be as high as 59%-65%. And compared to single production systems, the (energy saving ratio) ESR of the new system is over 11.0% and the energy consumption for SNG production can be decreased by around 12%. Sensitivity analysis shows that an optimized conversion ratio of SNG, (chemicals to power output ratio) CPOR, recycle ratio of the unconverted gas Ru, and pressure ratio of gas turbine can lead to the maximum of ESR. Abolishing the syngas composition adjustment and improving the inlet temperature of gas turbine both can help to enhance the system efficiency. Under low Ru, improving the H-2/CO mole ratio in the syngas helps to improve system efficiency, while under high Ru, an optimized H-2/CO can lead to the maximum of ESR. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a great deal of work has been carried out to evaluate the biomass of this group as well as its contribution to ecosystem N budgets, empirical studies are needed to confirm the N input responses by cyanolichens under climate change conditions (dry-hot stress) as well as to determine the factors that control this process. We simulated climate change conditions by transplanting Lobaria retigera, a common cyanolichen in the area, to lower elevations, and measured nitrogenase activity in response to warmer and drier conditions. In addition, we conducted a series of laboratory and greenhouse experiments to determine the dominant factors influencing nitrogenase activity in this species. The results of this study show that mean annual nitrogenase activity at the higher site was 1.5 and 2.4 times that at the simulated warmer and drier (middle and lower) sites, respectively. Combining laboratory experimental conclusions, we show that thallus water content is a key factor determining the nitrogenase activity of L. retigera in early transplantation while insufficient carbon storage resulting from a combination of warming and desiccation was likely responsible for reducing nitrogenase activity in later months of the transplant experiment. The results of this study imply that the negative impact of climate change (dry-hot stress) on ecosystems not only impacts the distribution and growth of species, but also nutrient circles and budgets.

The composition, distribution and source of the DOM in the Three Gorges Reservoir are investigated with impacted by 30 m water levels fluctuation, and the correlations between each fluorophore's intensity and environmental factors such as pH, DO (dissolved oxygen), DOC (dissolved organic carbon), ORP (oxidation-reduction potential) etc. are fitted. From the results, all the DOM's EEM from main streams in the Three Gorges Reservoir had four fluorescence peaks, attributed to protein-like, humic-like and fulvic-like respectively. During 175 m dry season, fluorescence intensities in EEMs increased from upstream to downstream, with the Dam section having the strongest intensity; comparatively, during 145 m wet season, the fluorescence intensities was obviously higher than those in dry season, impacted by terrestrial confluence along the bank of the Three Gorges Reservoir, and the strongest intensity occurred in the middle and upper reaches. A good correlation between environmental parameters and EEM Peaks was observed in dry season. On the contrary, only Peak A and DO has positive linear correlation during wet season. The present article revealed that the water quality in the Three Gorges Reservoir is mainly affected by the terrestrial confluence, with less impact by the 30 m water level fluctuation in reverse way to the Yangtze River's natural wet-dry law.

The characteristics of the EEM from DOM in the Reservoir, f(450/500) and r(C/D) are discussed with the water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon, oxidation reduction potential pH, etc. The focus is the sources, compositions, distributions, environmental behavior of the DOM that mainly composed of fulvic-like, humic-like and protein-like in each sampling sites of the Yangtze mainstream and its two branches. According to the experimental data, fulvic-like and protein-like are dominated in the mainstream, Jialin River mainly consists of protein-like and fulvic-like, which they have higher fluorescence intensity than any other sites, but humic-like enhanced and protein-like decreased after confluence of Jialin River and Yangtze in Chaotianmen. The intensity of fulvic-like is dominant in DOM of the Wu River, while joined the Yangtze River, the intensity of fulvic-like and protein-like is enhanced; the Jialin River for the upper stream and terrestrial source for the mainstream influence the DOM of the TGRA. The fit results reveal the partly linear correlation of the EEM features and characteristics of DOM with the parameters of water qualities, which could be an index and reference for the water monitor and evaluation.

Zero liquid discharge: Heading for 99% recovery in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis	DESALINATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Membrane Science and Technology Conference	NOV 05-09, 2007	Univ New S Wales, Sydney, AUSTRALIA		Univ New S Wales	Concentrate; Membrane filtration; Membrane fouling; Zero liquid discharge	NATURAL ORGANIC-MATTER; DRINKING-WATER PRODUCTION; MEMBRANES; MECHANISMS; ULTRAFILTRATION; FILTRATION	Concentrate of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis installations is an increasing problem, especially for inland membrane installations. Introduction of membrane filtration in The Netherlands is severely hindered by the concentrate problem. Two approaches are viable for solving or reducing the concentrate problem: (1) low recovery NF/RO without anti-sealant dosing, (2) Zero liquid discharge. This research focuses on the second option: Zero liquid discharge NF/RO. First and main problem to be solved with zero liquid discharge is to increase the recovery of the membrane installation to its limits, without increasing the costs of water produced. A high recovery (>99%) is necessary to reduce energy consumption and costs for evaporation of the remaining waste stream (<1%). The only possibility to achieve a very high recovery in NF/RO, is removing the scaling components from the feed water. A very important advantage of removing the scaling components is that the nanofiltration or RO can be operated at high fluxes. In this paper the results of two pilot experiments are reported. One treatment concept was developed for surface water treatment and one for groundwater treatment. The surface water treatment concept consisted of fluidized ion exchange to remove positive multivalent cations, and then followed by ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and granular activated carbon filtration. With this setup a recovery of 97% was achieved. To achieve an even higher recovery it is also important to remove silica from the feed water because silica can limit the recovery. Silica can be removed at high pH during co-precipitation with magnesium hydroxide. The groundwater concept consisted of: precipitation at high pH, then followed by sedimentation, weak acid cation exchange and nanofiltration. With this setup a recovery of 99% was achieved.

However, TiO2 generally shows a relatively low electron mobility, which may result in charge accumulation and recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface, thus hindering the improvements from the PMPSCs performance. In this study, a simple strategy to deposit a pristine C-60 layer using a spray method is reported and the low electrical conductivity of TiO2 in PMPSCs is modified. The preferable electron extraction and transportation properties of pristine C-60 and the up-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the C-60 modified TiO2, that is, TiO2(C-60) layer, efficiently promotes the charge transfer at the interface between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the perovskite. As a result, a significantly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.4% is yielded, which is much higher than that of the control device (13.7%). In addition, the TiO2(C-60)-based device presents a lower hysteresis effect than that of the TiO2-based device, which can likely be attributed to the reduced space charge accumulation at the perovskite/ETL interface. The present work provides a simple approach to boost the efficiency of PMPSCs and paves the way for the industrialization of PMPSCs.

The rigorous rate-based model, RateFrac in Aspen Plus, was thermodynamically and kinetically validated by experimental data from open literature and CSIRO pilot trials at Munmorah Power Station, Australia, respectively. After a thorough sensitivity analysis and process improvement, the NH3 recycling efficiency reached as high as 99.87%, and the NH3 exhaust concentration was only 15.4 ppmv. Most importantly, the energy consumption of the NH3 abatement and recycling system was only 59.34 kJ/kg CO2 of electricity. The evaluation of mass balance and temperature steady shows that this NH3 recovery process was technically effective and feasible. This process therefore is a promising prospect toward industrial application.

Single-Step Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth of Platinum Nanocrystal: Monolayer MoS2 Dendrite Hybrid Materials for Efficient Electrocatalysis	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							HYDROGEN EVOLUTION REACTION; EDGE-ORIENTED MOS2; CATALYTIC-ACTIVITY; SULFUR VACANCIES; NANOSHEETS; NANOPARTICLES; SUBSTRATE; REDUCTION; FILMS; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE	Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has excellent electrocatalytic behavior for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where the catalysis of 2H phase originates from its edges, defects, and strains. Most synthetic methods to activate the electrochemically inert basal planes with catalytic active metals are completed by sequential steps. However, this is extremely time-consuming and lacks production scalability. Herein, we develop a one-step strategy to achieve efficient electrocatalyst of Pt:MoS2 hybrid utilizing atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition synthesis on a conductive glassy carbon (GC) plate that can be directly employed as the working electrode in the HER. The monolayer thickness ensures decreased interlayer electron hopping and increased efficiency of the charge transfer from the electrode. We tune the domain morphology by controlling the precursor flux to enter kinetic or thermodynamic growth regime, delivering dendritic or triangular shape. The materials chemistry undertaken provides fundamental insights into the instability of Pt as metal substitutional dopants in the MoS2 lattice, and instead the stable configuration observed is with Pt as highly dispersed small nanocrystals and single atoms bound to the MoS2 surface. The Pt functionalization at a reduced loading level modulates the favorable HER pathway and triggers synergies in the cocatalyst, which exhibits an onset potential of 48 mV, a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), and an exchange current density of 110 mu A cm(-2). The enriched edges and defects of dendrite endow it superiority to the triangle, with regard to the density of catalytic sites and synergistic effects along with electrical resistance. These underpin the positive role of a large dendritic MoS2 monolayer as a Pt scaffold in water electrolysis.

Soil constituents, together with the mass of soil, are redistributed across landscapes by tillage. The pattern of tillage-induced soil constituent redistribution is determined by the pattern of tillage erosion (tillage-induced soil mass loss or gain) and the dispersivity of translocation. In this study, we used a convoluting procedure and developed a Tillage Translocation Model (TilITM) to simulate the tillage translocation process and to demonstrate tillage-induced soil mass and soil organic carbon (OC) (as an example of soil constituents) redistributions across four hypothetical landscapes subjected to different tillage patterns (directions) and over different lengths of tillage period. We determined that the local tillage-erosion rate is mainly dependent on topography and that the effects of tillage pattern and the length of tillage period are relatively minor. The redistribution of OC content in the till layer is mainly determined by the number, location, and size of soil loss positions in the landscape, as well as the soil loss rates at these positions. Net loss of OC content occurs in the till layer and this loss increases with time. In contrast, an increase of OC content in the sublayer occurs at soil accumulation positions. The model was validated against field data collected at a site near Cyrus, MN. The patterns of OC and inorganic C redistribution can be adequately estimated by TilITM. There are discrepancies, however, between the model-estimated values and the field measurements due to the limitations and uncertainties associated with the model. The results clearly showed that tillage translocation causes the vertical redistribution of soil constituents across the landscape, which implies that tillage translocation is one of the driving forces behind the spatial variability of soil properties and properties that impact biophysical processes.

Phytohormones, abscisic acid (ABA), and jasmonic acid (JA), play important roles in plant growth. A pot experiment was conducted to reveal the role of ABA and JA in regulating leaf gas exchange and growth in response to the neighborhood of plants under different nitrogen regimes. The experiment included two factors: two planting densities per pot (a single plant or four competing plants) and two N application levels per pot (1 and 15 mmol center dot L-1). Compared to when a single plant was grown per pot, neighboring competition decreased stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (T-r) and net photosynthesis (P-n). Shoot ABA and JA and the shoot-to-root ratio increased in response to neighbors. Both g(s) and P-n were negatively related to shoot ABA and JA. In addition, N shortage stimulated the accumulation of ABA in roots, especially for competing plants, whereas root JA in competing plants did not increase in N15. Pearson's correlation coefficient (R-2) of g(s) to ABA and g(s) to JA was higher in N1 than in N15. As compared to the absolute value of slope of g(s) to shoot ABA in N15, it increased in N1. Furthermore, the stomatal limitation and non-stomatal limitation of competing plants in N1 were much higher than in other treatments. It was concluded that the accumulations of ABA and JA in shoots play a coordinating role in regulating g(s) and P-n in response to neighbors; N shortage could intensify the impact of competition on limiting carbon fixation and plant growth directly.

However, current methods have been limited to complex, time-consuming, and toxic manufacturing process or unsatisfactory performance, which hugely restricts its practical applications. Herein, for the first time, a fast, simple, and nonpollution femtosecond laser direct writing technology is proposed to fabricate high-performance glucose sensor. The as-prepared nickel foam exhibits micro/nanostructures with superhydrophilic property, resulting in superior electrochemical sensing performance toward glucose. The sensitivity is determined to be 13.822 mA cm(-2) mM(-1) with the detection limit of 1.9 x 10(-6) m, outperforming the results from the most, previously reported works. Meanwhile, the excellent selectivity for glucose detection is also demonstrated in the presence of interferences.

However, micro silicon anodes coupled with conventional binders generally show poor performances in LIBs. Therefore, developing new binders with high performance for micro silicon anode in LIBs is highly desirable. In this work, we report the first lignin-derived water-soluble binder (lignin-graft-sodium polyacrylate, PAL-NaPAA) for the micro silicon anodes. The PAL-NaPAA binder is obtained via a free radical graft copolymerization, followed by an alkaline hydrolysis. The electrochemical performance of PAL-NaPAA is compared with commercial binder carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) for micro silicon anodes. The electrode using the PAL-NaPAA binder retains a capacity of 1914 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a constant current density of 840 mA g(-1), which is superior to that of the electrode using the CMC binder (1544 mAh g(-1)). Additionally, the successful adhibition of PAL-NaPAA binder to commercial silicon-carbon anodes demonstrates great potential in practical applications in LIBs. It is also found that the lignin-derived binder can significantly accommodate the inevitable volume changes of silicon anode, while maintaining its excellent electrochemical performance. Our results provide a facile approach to utilize the abundant lignin biomass as a novel bind material and have paved the way to the industrial applications of micro silicon-based anodes in LIBs.

Lysoglycerophospholipids (Lyso-GPLs) are known to be associated with proatherogenic conditions such as hyperlipidaemia. In this study, a target profiling strategy based on a multiple reaction monitoring mode was applied for the analysis of Lyso-GPLs. The metabolic changes were evaluated by the qualitative and relative quantitative distribution of six classes of Lyso-GPLs in mouse serum. A total of 153 Lyso-GPL regioisomers, consisting of 85 lysophosphatidylcholines, 15 lysophosphatidic acids, 23 lysophosphatidylethanolamines, 5 lysophosphatidylserines, 19 lysophosphatidylinositols and 6 lysophosphatidylglycerols, were detected and quantified. The results showed decreased trends in the content of total Lyso-GPLs in the serum of hyperlipidemic mice compared with that in normal controls. The content of total Lyso-GPLs significantly increased after treatment with triterpenoid saponins from Kuding tea. Among them, the proportions of most Lyso-GPLs with a higher degree of unsaturation or a longer carbon chain in fatty acyl chains dramatically decreased in hyperlipidemic mice. However, this tendency reversed after the treatment of triterpenoid saponins from Kuding tea. This is the first study regarding a target profiling strategy for the quantitative analysis of six different types of Lyso-GPLs on high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic mice intervened by Kuding tea. Those Lyso-GPLs changed significantly may be potential biomarkers for hyperlipidaemia, and involved in the mechanism of the preventive intervention of Kuding tea on Lipid metabolic diseases.

The CO2 concentrations are usually prescribed homogenously in most climate models and the spatiotemporal variations of CO2 are neglected. To address this issue, a regional climate model (RegCM4) is modified to investigate the non-homogeneous distribution of CO2 and its effects on regional longwave radiation flux and temperature in East Asia. One-year simulation is performed with prescribed surface CO2 fluxes that include fossil fuel emission, biomass burning, air-sea exchange, and terrestrial biosphere flux. Two numerical experiments (one using constant prescribed CO2 concentrations in the radiation scheme and the other using the simulated CO2 concentrations that are spatially non-homogeneous) are conducted to assess the impact of non-homogeneous CO2 on the regional longwave radiation flux and temperature. Comparison of CO2 concentrations from the model with the observations from the GLOBALVIEW-CO2 network suggests that the model can well capture the spatiotemporal patterns of CO2 concentrations. Generally, high CO2 mixing ratios appear in the heavily industrialized eastern China in cold seasons, which probably relates to intensive human activities. The accommodation of non-homogeneous CO2 concentrations in the radiative transfer scheme leads to an annual mean change of-0.12 W m(-2) in total sky surface upward longwave flux in East Asia. The experiment with non-homogeneous CO2 tends to yield a warmer lower troposphere. Surface temperature exhibits a maximum difference in summertime, ranging from-4.18 K to 3.88 K, when compared to its homogeneous counterpart. Our results indicate that the spatial and temporal distributions of CO2 have a considerable impact on regional longwave radiation flux and temperature, and should be taken into account in future climate modeling.

The concentrations of minerals and trace elements in selected oil shale samples from the Shichanggou area were measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Analyzed oil shale samples are characterized by high total organic carbon (TOC) contents (7.76-22.15%) and ash yields (49.35-70.73%) with oil yields from 3.92% to 13.8%. Shichanggou oil shale samples are rich in SiO2 (64.77%), followed by Al2O3 (9.14%) and Fe2O3 (4.19%). Compared with average shale composition (ASC) from Clarke and North American Shale Composite (NASC), analyzed oil shale samples are enriched in Ca (4.04%) and Mg (3.14%), especially P (0.69%). Al2O3 correlates quite well with Fe2O3, K2O, Na2O, MnO, TiO2, Cu, Ba, Co, and Ni for their association with clay minerals. Besides, the significant correlations between Fe2O3 and MnO, Co, Ni, Ti, Cr are considered to result from their similarity on geochemical behavior. All selected oil shales are characterized by distinctly sloping light rare earth elements (LREE) trends ((La-N/Sm-N =2.33-3.61) accompanied by flat heavy rare earth elements (HREE) trends, with distinct Eu negative anomalies (0.58-0.74). Discrimination diagrams based on geochemistry and some ratios of elements indicate that Shichanggou oil shales were deposited in deep water environments with warm-humid climates and anoxic conditions, and we believe the original sediments were consisted of felsic rocks from the west orogenic belt. Geochemical data for oil shales suggest a continental island arc setting. Together with regional geological evidence, the Shichanggou oil shales were deposited in a back-arc intracontinental basin.

This paper presents new oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions from well dated Tertiary paleosols, lacustrine calcareous carbonates, and marls from the Nianbo (60-54 Ma) and upper Pana Formations (51-48 Ma) of the Linzizong Group in the Linzhou (Penbo) Basin. The sediments of the Nianbo Formation, which are >180 m-thick, were deposited in alluvial fans, braided rivers, fan deltas, and on nearshore to offshore lacustrine settings, whereas those of the upper Pana Formation are >100 m-thick and are comprised predominantly of proximal alluvial fan and braided river deposits. Correlations between the lithofacies and stable isotopic compositions suggest that the basin was mainly a hydrologically open environment. It is confirmed that the delta O-18(c) and delta C-13(c) values from Nianbo and Pana Formations have not yet been reset by late-stage diagenesis based on petrographic examination, oxygen isotope of the fossil ostracodes, and tectonic deformation of strata. The paleoelevations are reconstructed using the corrected most negative paleosurface water delta O-18(psw) values. These imply that the Linzhou area had attained an elevation of 4500 +/- 400 m during the period of the lndo-Asian collision, i.e., achieved a near-present elevation, and may form an Andean-type mountain range stretching the Gangdese arc before collision. The Gangdese Mountains probably maintained high elevations since at least the Paleocene and could play a crucial role in the climate change in the interior of the Tibetan Plateau during the Early Cenozoic. The paleogeomorphic scenario of the Eocene Tibet is proposed to exist at two high mountains in excess of 4500 m that sandwiched a low elevation basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ground-based observations of aerosols have much higher temporal resolutions than satellite retrievals. An initial analysis reveals the characteristics of the optical properties of different types of fractionated aerosols in the western YRD. The total aerosols, mostly composed of scattering components (93.8 %), have mean optical depths of 0.65 at 550 nm and refractive index of 1.44+0.0084i at 440 nm. The fine aerosols are approximately four times more abundant and have very different compositions from coarse aerosols. The absorbing components account for only similar to 4.6% of fine aerosols and 15.5% of coarse aerosols and have smaller sizes than the scattering aerosols within the same mode. Therefore, fine particles have stronger scattering than coarse ones, simultaneously reflecting the different size distributions between the absorbing and scattering aerosols. The relationships among the optical properties quantify the aerosol mixing and imply that approximately 15 and 27.5% of the total occurrences result in dust- and black-carbon-dominating mixing aerosols, respectively, in the western YRD. Unlike the optical properties, the size distributions of aerosols in the western YRD are similar to those found at other sites over eastern China on a climato-logical scale, peaking at radii of 0.148 and 2.94 mu m. However, further analysis reveals that the coarse-dominated particles can also lead to severe haze pollution over the YRD. Observation-based estimations indicate that both fine and coarse aerosols in the western YRD exert negative DRFs, and this is especially true for fine aerosols (-11.17 W m(-2) at the top of atmosphere, TOA). A higher absorption fraction leads directly to the negative DRF being further offset for coarse aerosols (-0.33 Wm(-2)) at the TOA. Similarly, the coarsemode DRF contributes to only 13.3% of the total scattering aerosols but >33.7% to the total absorbing aerosols. A sensitivity analysis states that aerosol DRFs are not highly sensitive to their profiles in clear-sky conditions. Most of the aerosol properties and DRFs have substantial seasonality in the western YRD. The results further reveal the contributions of each component of the different size particles to the total aerosol optical depths (AODs) and DRFs. Additionally, these results can be used to improve aerosol modelling performance and the modelling of aerosol effects in the eastern regions of China.

Herein with incorporation of only 1-wt% MPP nanowires (PET/FR1.0 nanocomposite), the limiting oxygen index (LOI) value was dramatically increased to 29.4% from 20.5%, showing self-extinguishing behavior. Moreover, PET/FR1.0 nanocomposite passed V-0 UL-94 rating in the vertical combustion test. However, PET containing 5-wt% commercial MPP powder (PET/FR(C)5.0) only showed a LOI of 27.9% and ignited the absorbent cotton with flammable melt-droplets. Cone results also presented that introducing 1-wt% MPP nanowires brought about a crucial decrease in fire hazard of PET, for instance, 11.1% and 7.7% maximum reduction in heat release rate and total heat release, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis/infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR) result indicated that the main pyrolysis volatiles generated from PET degradation including benzoic acid, aromatic compounds, and carbon dioxide were apparently suppressed after introducing MPP nanowires into PET matrixes, suggesting the outstanding obstructing effect of graphited char residue formed in the combustion. This enhanced flame retardancy rooting in addition of MPP nanowires can be attributed to the combined dilution effect in gaseous phase and catalytic carbonization effect in condensed phase.

A three-dimensional characterization of Arctic aerosols from airborne Sun photometer observations: PAM-ARCMIP, April 2009	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							LONG-TERM DECREASE; BLACK CARBON; OPTICAL DEPTH; TROPOSPHERIC AEROSOL; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; NOAA WP-3D; EL-CHICHON; HAZE; PARTICLES; RADIATION	The Arctic climate is modulated, in part, by atmospheric aerosols that affect the distribution of radiant energy passing through the atmosphere. Aerosols affect the surface-atmosphere radiation balance directly through interactions with solar and terrestrial radiation and indirectly through interactions with cloud particles. Better quantification of the radiative forcing by different types of aerosol is needed to improve predictions of future climate. During April 2009, the airborne campaign Pan-Arctic Measurements and Arctic Regional Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (PAM-ARCMIP) was conducted. The mission was organized by Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research of Germany and utilized their research aircraft, Polar-5. The goal was to obtain a snapshot of surface and atmospheric conditions over the central Arctic prior to the onset of the melt season. Characterizing aerosols was one objective of the campaign. Standard Sun photometric procedures were adopted to quantify aerosol optical depth AOD, providing a three-dimensional view of the aerosol, which was primarily haze from anthropogenic sources. Independent, in situ measurements of particle size distribution and light extinction, derived from airborne lidar, are used to corroborate inferences made using the AOD results. During April 2009, from the European to the Alaskan Arctic, from sub-Arctic latitudes to near the pole, the atmosphere was variably hazy with total column AOD at 500 nm ranging from similar to 0.12 to >0.35, values that are anomalously high compared with previous years. The haze, transported primarily from Eurasian industrial regions, was concentrated within and just above the surface-based temperature inversion layer. Extinction, as measured using an onboard lidar system, was also greatest at low levels, where particles tended to be slightly larger than at upper levels. Black carbon (BC) (soot) was observed at all levels sampled, but at moderate to low concentrations compared with historical records. BC was highest near the North Pole, suggesting there had been an accumulation of soot within the Arctic vortex. Few, optically thick elevated aerosol layers were observed along the flight track, although independent lidar observations reveal evidence of the passage of volcanic plumes, which may have contributed to abnormally high values of AOD above 4 km. Enhanced opacity at higher altitudes during the campaign is attributed to an accumulation of industrial pollutants in the upper troposphere in combination with volcanic aerosol resulting from the March-April 2009 eruptions of Mount Redoubt in Alaska. The presence of Arctic haze during April 2009 is estimated to have reduced the net shortwave irradiance by similar to 2-5 W m(-2), resulting in a slight cooling of the surface.	[Stone, R.

Leaf Senescence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LIPID-PEROXIDATION; ABSCISIC-ACID; B RADIATION; CELL-DEATH; XYLEM SAP; LEAVES; ARABIDOPSIS; REFLECTANCE; TEMPERATURE; EXPRESSION	Leaf senescence plays a vital role in nutrient recycling and overall capacity to assimilate carbon dioxide. Cotton premature leaf senescence, often accompanied with unexpected short-term low temperature, has been occurring with an increasing frequency in many cotton-growing areas and causes serious reduction in yield and quality of cotton. The key factors for causing and promoting cotton premature leaf senescence are still unclear. In this case, the relationship between the pre-chilling stress and Alternaria alternata infection for causing cotton leaf senescence was investigated under precisely controlled laboratory conditions with four to five leaves stage cotton plants. The results showed short-term chilling stress could cause a certain degree of physiological impairment to cotton leaves, which could be recovered to normal levels in 2-4 days when the chilling stresses were removed. When these chilling stress injured leaves were further inoculated with A. alternata, the pronounced appearance and development of leaf spot disease, and eventually the pronounced symptoms of leaf senescence, occurred on these cotton leaves. The onset of cotton leaf senescence at this condition was also reflected in various physiological indexes such as irreversible increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage, irreversible decrease in soluble protein content and chlorophyll content, and irreversible damage in leaves' photosynthesis ability. The presented results demonstrated that chilling stress acted as the key predisposing factor for causing A. alternata infection and leading to cotton leaf senescence. It could be expected that the understanding of the key factors causing and promoting cotton leaf senescence would be helpful for taking appropriate management steps to prevent cotton premature leaf senescence.

The feasibility of solidification/stabilization of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ashes by MSCM were evaluated, and the immobilization mechanisms of heavy metals were proposed. The MSCM paste achieved 28-day strength of 35.2 MPa, showing its high-hydration reactivity. While the fly ash content was as high as 80 wt.%, the 28-day strength of MSCM-fly ash blocks reached 2.2 MPa, and the leaching concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cr, and Hg were much lower than the limit values of the Chinese landfill standard (GB 16889-2008). The immobilization rates of each heavy metal reached 98.75-99.99%, while four kinds of MSWI fly ashes were solidified by MSWI at fly ash content of 60 wt.%. The 28-day strength of binder-fly ash blocks had an increase of 104.92-127.96% by using MSCM to replace ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Correspondingly, the lower leachability of heavy metals was achieved by using MSCM compared to OPC. The mechanisms of solidification/stabilization treatment of MSWI fly ash by MSCM were investigated by XRD, SEM, and TG-DSC. Numerous hydrates, such as calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), ettringite (AFt), and Friedel's salt, were observed in hardened MSCM-fly ash pastes. Heavy metals from both MSWI fly ash and MSCM could be effectively immobilized via adsorption, cation exchange, precipitation, and physical encapsulation.

It has been well established that liver fibrosis is characterized of excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in chronically damaged livers. Accumulating evidences have suggested that ethyl pyruvate (EP) is a potential useful agent for preventing from hepatic injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of the EP against liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in rats. Method: Rats were randomly divided into control group, CCl4 group and CCM+EP group, which with and without EP administration. Liver fibrosis was evaluated by serum biochemical parameters levels. Masson's trichromic staining and immunohistochemistry. Q-RTPCR was used to indicate genes expression. ELISA was used to detect proteins level. Results: This study demonstrates that Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signal is an important regulator of liver fibrosis while TLR4/NF-kappa B mRNA and protein levels reduced during HSCs activation. In addition, down-regulated high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression reduced NF-kappa B transcription and phosphorylation, which inhibited HSCs activation by blocking the TLR4 signal. Moreover, EP contributed to an increase in the ratio of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) to tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMPs), which might facilitate the degradation of the ECM. In Ca4-induced liver fibrosis rats, additional EP injection resulted in decreased ECM deposition and improved liver function. Conclusion: In conclusion, the present findings indicated that EP might be an effective agent for anti-fibrotic therapy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The composites were characterized and examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical methods, such as cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. The HCPS/Se composite cathode can deliver relative high capacity, high Coulombic efficiency and good cycling performance. The electrochemical results show that the HCPS/Se composite cathode exhibits an initial discharge specific capacity of 571.5 mA h g(-1) and retains 298.7 mA h g(-1) with high Coulombic efficiency after 100 cycles at a high rate of 0.5 C (337.5 mA h g(-1)), which are higher than that of the pristine selenium cathode. The excellent electrochemical properties benefit from the high conductivity and the hollow structures of the carbonized polyaniline spheres. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two-Step Saccharification of Rice Straw Using Solid Acid Catalysts	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							ENZYMATIC-HYDROLYSIS; CELLULOSE; PRETREATMENT; GLUCOSE; BIOMASS; CONVERSION; HARDWOOD; GREEN	To establish an efficient bioethanol production system, a solid-acid catalyst-based saccharification of rice straw in two steps was developed. It was rarely concerned so far that many biomass species contain a significant amount of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs, free sugars and starch). NSCs, including hemicellulose, are readily hydrolyzed but also susceptible to overreaction with byproducts. In the developed process, the first step is intended to effectively hydrolyze the significant sugar source of NSCs and HC in rice straw under a mild condition, and the second step is addressed to hydrolyze the cellulose in the residue obtained under a harsh condition. For each step, several catalysts were screened and reaction condition were investigated. For the first step, an appropriate catalyst was Amberlyst 35 Dry, at 130 degrees C for 30 min in which high yields of C6 monosaccharide, 47.2%, and C5 monosaccharide, 10.8%, were obtained. For the second step, the most active catalyst was a sulfonated mesoporous carbon that provided a maximum yield of C6 sugar (52.5%) at 220 degrees C for 0 min. A test with the sequential two-step saccharification provided a 65% yield of sugars. From the investigations, the most studied modified pathways of dilute-acid catalyzed hydrolysis of HC and cellulose were also likely to occur with a solid-acid catalyst with an additional pathway of direct hydrolysis of NSCs to C6. To support the observed phenomena, the characteristics of the RS before and after saccharifications were analyzed using SEM and XRD. Thus, this process represents a method to increase the cost-effectiveness of bioethanol production system in an environmentally sound way.

A novel sludge minimized biological nitrogen removal process for saline sewage treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						autotrophic denitrification and nitrification; excess sludge minimization; SANI process; sulfate reduction		This study reports a lab-scale evaluation of a new biological nitrogen removal process for saline sewage treatment, namely a SANI process (Sulfate reduction, Autotrophic denitrification and Nitrification Integrated process). The experimental system consisted of an up-flow anaerobic bed for sulfate reduction, an anoxic filter for autotrophic denitrification using dissolved sulfide produced in the up-flow anaerobic bed and an aerobic filter for nitrification. The system successfully operated for more than 180 days with an overall organic carbon removal efficiency of 95%, in which, 82% removal was contributed by the up-flow anaerobic bed operating at a HRT of 6 h, and 13% removal by the anoxic filter. An average COD removed /sulfate removed ratio was found to be 0.76 gCOD/gSO(4) or 2.28 COD/gSO(4)-S further confirming that the organic removal was mainly achieved by the sulfate reduction. In terms of nitrogen removal efficiency, the SANI system was found sensitive to the recirculation rate between the anoxic filter and the aerobic filter. A recirculation rate of 3Q was found to be optimal for achieving 74% of the total nitrogen removal. It was confirmed that the autotrophic denitrification was a major contributor to the total nitrogen removal in the SANI system. Sulfur balance analysis indicated that both the accumulation of elementary sulfur in the biomass and the loss of hydrogen sulfide were trivial. During the entire operation period (330 days to date), no sludge was wasted from any reactors in this system. This was further confirmed by the biomass balance simulation results that low biomass yields of sulfate reducing bacteria, autotrophic denitrifiers and nitrifiers contribute to the zero excess sludge discharge.

In this study, short fiberglass reinforced polycarbonate composite materials were fabricated and characterized for their tensile properties by varying the fiberglass loading fraction. The debonding stress was evaluated by coupling the acoustic emission technique with the tensile testing. After the determination of the debonding stress was completed, dynamic cyclic testing was performed in order to investigate the effect of debonding on the damping properties of the polymer composites. It was experimentally observed in this study that the debonding can facilitate the stick-slip friction under cyclic loadings, which then gives rise to better damping performance in the fiberglass composites.

Occurrence and risk assessment of trace organic contaminants and metals in anaerobically co-digested sludge	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Co-digestion; Beverage reject; Food waste; Land application; Environmental risk	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; TREATMENT PLANTS; FOOD WASTE; PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS; BIOGAS PRODUCTION; ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; REMOVAL	Anaerobic co-digestion of sludge increases biogas production and maintains anaerobic digestion stability. However, it is unclear whether the addition of co-substrates may increase the concentration of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) and metals, limiting potential resource recovery opportunities when applied to agricultural land. This study explored the occurrence of 20 TrOCs and 18 metals in wastewater sludge anaerobically co-digested with beverage rejects (cola, beer and juice) and food wastes. TrOCs results showed that cola reject caused an accumulation of caffeine in final digestate. Bisphenol A also significantly increased in food waste co-digestion when compared with the mono-digestion (control). No significant difference in TrOCs was observed in the juice reject co-digestion. Analysis of the metal composition revealed a significant increase in Cr and Al in juice reject co digested sludge. While restaurant food waste increased concentrations of K and Ca, both of which may be beneficial when applied to land. All metals in this study were below the maximum permissible concentrations specified for agricultural land use in Australia. Environmental risk assessment of sludge when used as soil fertiliser, showed that caffeine, diuron, triclocarban, triclosan, Cu and Zn exhibited high risks, with the largest risk quotient (RQ) posed by caffeine. Estrone and naproxen implied medium risks, and ibuprofen implied a high risk except for the co-digestion using cola reject (RQ = 0.9, medium risk). The results emphasise the importance for wastewater utility operators to understand the impact of co-substrate selection on the quality of sludge to minimise environmental risk from the use of biosolids on agricultural land.

The beneficial effects of exogenous spermidine (Spd, a kind of polyamine) on plant growth and development under salt stress have been widely reported; however, little information is available on the effects of Spd on the combined treatment of CO2 enrichment and iso-osmotic salt stress. In this work, the effects of exogenous Spd (0.25mM) on plant growth, chlorophyll content, water status, osmotic adjustment, and the antioxidant system were investigated under CO2 enrichment (800ppm) and iso-osmotic salt stress [150mmol/L NaCl and 100mmol/L Ca(NO3)(2)] in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The results showed that iso-osmotic salt stress significantly decreased fresh and dry weights of plants, relative water content, total root length, total root surface area, total root volume, and average root diameter in tomato plants. However, either elevated CO2 or exogenous Spd both attenuated iso-osmotic salt stress-induced reductions in growth parameters and the combined treatment of elevated CO2 and Spd showed a more profound effect, leading to the enhanced tolerance to salt stress in tomato plants. Elevated CO2 and/or exogenous Spd-induced alleviation of iso-osmotic salt stress was associated with efficient osmotic adjustment and antioxidant defense, which minimized the salt stress-induced oxidative stress as well. Therefore, Spd application can be advocated to mitigate secondary salinization in protected vegetable production where elevated CO2 is simultaneously used to boost crop yield.

Next generation electronic devices call for self-healing conductors that can mimic the damage repairing ability of natural skins to achieve good reliability and sustainability. Herein, we report a self-healing, robustly conductive, and stretchable conductor enabled by embedding liquid metal (LM) patterns within an imprintable self-healing elastomer. A self-healing poly(dimethylsiloxane)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (PDMS/MWCNT) elastomer was designed by incorporating reversible imine bonds to act as self-healing points and MWCNTs as reinforcement, which featured high stretchability (500%), good elastic recovery and room temperature self-healing ability (94.3% efficiency). Taking advantage of the good imprintability of the self-healing elastomer, a structure confined filling strategy combining nanoimprinting with printing technology was proposed to fabricate embedded LM circuits with a controlled line width in a variety of geometric patterns. The resultant LM embedded structures not only offer a reliable interface to achieve robust conductivity that can resist scraping and peeling, but also provide channels for the fluidic LM to flow and automatically merge together to reestablish conductive pathways. Good healing of mechanical and electrical properties is achieved simultaneously by taking advantage of the dynamic reconstruction of the self-healing substrate and fluidity of the LM. Finally, a fully stretchable and self-healing capacitive strain sensor was demonstrated, showing potential applications in self-healing electronic skin.

The locus coeruleus (LC) is a stress sensitive brain region located in the pons, with noradrenergic neurons that project to the hypothalamus, especially the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. The purpose of this paper is to better understand how alpha 2A-adrenoceptors (alpha(2A)-ARs) and LC-hypothalamus noradrenergic system participate in the pathophysiological mechanism of depression. In vivo norepinephrine (NE) release in the PVN triggered by electrical stimulation in the LC was detected with carbon fiber electrodes in depression model of rats induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (GUMS). Also, the extracellular level of NE in the PVN was measured by microdialysis in vivo without any stimulation in the LC. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor (alpha(2)-AR) antagonist yohimbine and alpha(2A)-ARs antagonist BRL-44408 maleate were systemically administered to rats to determine the effects of alpha(2A)-ARs on NE release in the PVN. The peak value of elicited NE release signals in the PVN induced by electrical stimulation in the LC in the GUMS rats were lower than that in the control rats. The extracellular levels of NE in the PVN of the GUMS rats were significantly less than that of the control rats. Intraperitoneal injection of yohimbine or BRL-44408 maleate significantly potentiated NE release in the PVN of the GUMS rats. The GUMS significantly increased protein expression levels of alpha(2A)-AR in the hypothalamus, and BRL-44408 maleate significantly reversed the increase of alpha(2A)-AR protein expression levels in the GUMS rats. Our results suggest that the GUMS could significantly facilitate the effect of alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition and decrease the release of NE in the PVN from LC. Blockade of the inhibitory action of excessive alpha 2A-adrenergic receptors in the GUMS rats could increase the level of NE in the PVN, which is effective in the treatment of depressive disorders.

Heterogeneous oxidation of sulfur dioxide by ozone on the surface of sodium chloride and its mixtures with other components	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							SEA-SALT PARTICLES; MINERAL DUST; EAST-ASIA; TROPOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; PHYSICAL-CHEMISTRY; CHEMICAL-PROCESSES; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; SULFATE FORMATION; FINE PARTICLES; AIR MASSES	The heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 by O-3 on NaCl particles has been studied using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The formation of sulfite and sulfate on the surface was identified, and the roles of O-3 and water in the oxidation processes were determined. The results showed that in the presence of O-3, SO2 could be oxidized to sulfate on the surface of NaCl particles. The reaction is first order in O-3 and zero order in SO2. The initial reactive uptake coefficient for SO2 [(0.6-9.8) x 10(14) molecule cm(-3)] oxidation by O3 [(1.2-12)x 10(14) molecule cm(-3)] was determined to be (4.8-0.7) x 10(-8) using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller area as the reactive area and (9.8-1.4) x 10(-5) using the geometric area at 40% relative humidity. A three-stage mechanism that involves the adsorption of O-3 results in an alkalescent surface, the adsorption of SO2 followed by O-3 oxidation is proposed, and the adsorption of O-3 on the NaCl surface is the rate-determining step. The proposed mechanism can well explain the experiment results. Furthermore, the surface oxidation on mixtures of NaCl with other components such as CaCO3, Al2O3, TiO2, MgCl2 6H(2)O, MgO, elemental carbon, and soot were studied. The reactivity of mixtures can be predicted from the reactivity of the single component with each component weighted by its abundance in the mixture. The catalytic and basic additives could enhance the production of sulfate on the NaCl surface.

However, the mechanical brittleness and complicated installation process of micro-electromechanical system vibration sensors block their applications in wearable devices and human-machine interaction. The development of flexible vibration sensors satisfying the requirements of good flexibility, high sensitivity, and the ability to attach conformably on curved critical components is highly demanded but still remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a highly sensitive and fully flexible vibration sensor with a channel-crack-designed suspended sensing membrane for high dynamic vibration and acceleration monitoring. The flexible sensor is designed as a suspended vibration membrane structure by bonding a channel-crack-sensing membrane on a cavity substrate, of which the suspended sensing membrane can freely vibrate out of plane under external vibration. By inducing the cracks to be generated in the embedded multiwalled carbon nanotube channels and fully cracked across the conducting routes, the suspended vibration membrane shows high sensitivity, good reproducibility, and robust sensing stability. The resultant vibration sensor demonstrates an ultrawide frequency vibration response range from 0.1 to 20,000 Hz and exhibits the ability to respond to acceleration vibration with a broad response of 0.24-100 m/s(2). The high sensitivity, wide bandwidth, and fully flexible format of the vibration sensor enable it to be directly attached on human bodies and curvilinear surfaces to conduct in situ vibration sensing, which was demonstrated by motion detection, voice identification, and the vibration monitoring of mechanical equipment.

Samples were extracted with acetone containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid, purified by a mixed sorbent of ethylenediamine-N-propylsilane (PSA), C18, anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), separated by a reversed phase C18 column, and gradiently eluted with acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid solution (containing 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate). Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was used as a dewatering agent. The positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode were used in the analysis, and the analytes were quantified by external standard method. Thifluzamide and triclopyricarbe showed good linearities in the range of 20.47-200 mu g/kg, and the limits of detection (LODs) and the limits of quantification (LOQs) were 6.15-16.67 and 20.47-55.5 mu g/kg, respectively. The other 25 new fungicides showed good linearities in the range of 0.02-100 mu g/kg, and the LODs and LOQs were 0.006-4.44 and 0.02-14.79 mu g/kg, respectively. The linear relative coefficients were not less than 0.9950. The recoveries were in the range of 70.02%-117.6% and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranged from 0.01% to 19.62% (n = 3). The method has the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, high sensitivity and better purification effect. It is suitable for the rapid determination of the 27 new fungicides in cereals, vegetables and fruits.

Lead glass is commonly used as an optical material due to its high refractive index and low transition temperature. A nickel-phosphorous (Ni-P) plated mold is traditionally employed in the PGM process for microstructures optics. However, leaded glass is subject to color change and can blacken during the PGM process, reducing the light transmittance of microgrooves. In this paper, an equation for the redox reaction between Ni and Pb is proposed, which is based on the diffusion of inner Ni atoms to the surface of the mold and the standard electrode potential of the Pb ions in leaded glass. A viscoelastic constitutive model of the glass is established to simulate the compression stress distribution during molding. Finally, the effects of molding pressure, molding temperature, and mold material on glass blackening are studied. The results show that the blackening of leaded glass is caused by Pb enriching the surface. The rise in molding stress and temperature increases the deformation of Ni-P plating, which promotes the diffusion of Ni atoms. By adding a titanium incorporated diamond-like carbon (TiDLC) coating, the deformation of the Ni-P plating during molding is suppressed, and the diffusion of Ni atoms can be prevented. In this way, the blackening of leaded glass can be prevented.

Due to their high linear energy transfer (LET) property, they are known to generate single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertion/deletions (InDels, <50 bp) as well as structural variations (SVs). However, due to the technical difficulties to identify SVs, studies on ion beam induced SVs by genome sequencing have so far been limited in numbers and inadequate in nature, and knowledge of SVs is scarce with regards to their characteristics. In the present study, we identified and validated SVs in six M4 plants (designated as Ar_50, Ar_100, C_150, C_200, Ne_50 and Ne_100 according to ion beam types and irradiation doses), two each induced by argon (Ar-40(18+)), carbon (C-12(6+)) and neon (Ne-20(10+)) ion beams and performed in depth analyses of their characteristics. In total, 22 SVs were identified and validated, consisting of 11 deletions, 1 duplication, and 4 intra-chromosomal and 6 inter-chromosomal translocations. There were several SVs larger than 1 kbp. The SVs were distributed across the whole genome with an aggregation with SNVs and InDels only in the Ne_50 mutants. An enrichment of a 11-bp wide G-rich DNA motif 'GAAGGWGGRGG' was identified around the SV breakpoints. Three mechanisms might be involved in the SV formation, i.e., the expansion of tandem repeats, transposable element insertion, and non-allelic homologous recombination. Put together, the present study provides a preliminary view of SVs induced by Ar, C and Ne ion beam radiations, and as a pilot study, it contributes to our understanding of how SVs might form after ion beam irradiation in rice.

The results show that the substrates modify the electronic properties of silicene due to the difference of charge population between the two sublattices. A sizable band gap is created at the Dirac point, which could be widened by bias voltage. It is theorized that the hetero-structures could provide a viable route to silicene-based electronic devices.

A density functional for sparse matter	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article							GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; EXCHANGE-CORRELATION ENERGY; ELECTRON-GAS; DISPERSION CORRECTIONS; STACKING INTERACTIONS; BASE-PAIRS; DNA; COMPLEXES; HYDROGEN; BINDING	Sparse matter is abundant and has both strong local bonds and weak nonbonding forces, in particular nonlocal van der Waals (vdW) forces between atoms separated by empty space. It encompasses a broad spectrum of systems, like soft matter, adsorption systems and biostructures. Density-functional theory (DFT), long since proven successful for dense matter, seems now to have come to a point, where useful extensions to sparse matter are available. In particular, a functional form, vdW-DF (Dion et al 2004 Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 246401; Thonhauser et al 2007 Phys. Rev. B 76 125112), has been proposed for the nonlocal correlations between electrons and applied to various relevant molecules and materials, including to those layered systems like graphite, boron nitride and molybdenum sulfide, to dimers of benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), doped benzene, cytosine and DNA base pairs, to nonbonding forces in molecules, to adsorbed molecules, like benzene, naphthalene, phenol and adenine on graphite, alumina and metals, to polymer and carbon nanotube (CNT) crystals, and hydrogen storage in graphite and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and to the structure of DNA and of DNA with intercalators. Comparison with results from wavefunction calculations for the smaller systems and with experimental data for the extended ones show the vdW-DF path to be promising. This could have great ramifications.	[Langreth, D. C.; Cooper, V.

Therefore the main objective of this work is the preparation of TiBN and TiBCN coatings with a nanocomposite structure offering a higher micro-hardness as well as an improved wear resistance. Arc ion plating was used for the deposition of the TiBN and TiBCN coatings on Si (100) and cemented carbide substrates. TiBN nanocomposites coatings was deposited using TiB2 composite target in pure N-2 whereas for TiBCN coatings was in mixed C2H2 and N-2. The components, microstructure and mechanical properties behavior of the nanocomposite coatings were investigated. TiBN coatings consisted of the crystalline phases TiN, TiB2 and amorphous BN. A maximum micro-hardness of about 3160 HV was observed at a 0.5 Pa N-2 pressure while the micro-hardness correlates well with N-2 pressure. TiBCN coatings prepared with the N-2 and C2H2 process exhibit a nanocomposite structure of nanocrystalline TiN and TiB2, morphous C, CN and BN. Compared to TiBN, lower micro-hardness of the TiBCN coatings down to 1761 HV was measured for at 1/2 gas flow ratio of C2H2 and N-2. For grinding material cemented carbide, the friction coefficient of TiBN coating was nearly 0.4 while the friction coefficient of TiBCN coatings was lower 0.2 with the increasing of C2H2 and N-2 flow ratio.

Several lines of evidence support that a major impact of stress on the gastrointestinal tract occurs via the enteric nervous system. We aimed to evaluate histological changes in the submucosal plexus (SMP) and myenteric plexus (MP) of the distal ileum in concert with the intestinal motor function in a rat model of IBS with diarrhea. Methods The rat model was induced by heterotypic chronic and acute stress (CAS). The intestinal transit was measured by administering powdered carbon by gastric gavage. Double immunohistochemical fluorescence staining with whole-mount preparations of SMP and MP of enteric nervous system was used to assess changes in expression of choline acetyltransferase, vasoactive intestinal peptide, or nitric oxide synthase in relation to the pan neuronal marker, anti-Hu. Results The intestinal transit ratio increased significantly from control values of 50.8% to 60.6% in the CAS group. The numbers of enteric ganglia and neurons in the SMP were increased in the CAS group. The proportions of choline acetyltransferase- and vasoactive intestinal peptide-immunoreactive neurons in the SMP were increased (82.1 +/- 4.3% vs. 76.0 +/- 5.0%, P = 0.021; 40.5 +/- 5.9% vs 28.9 +/- 3.7%, P = 0.001), while nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurons in the MP were decreased compared with controls (23.3 +/- 4.5% vs 32.4 +/- 4.5%, P = 0.002). Conclusions These morphological changes in enteric neurons to CAS might contribute to the dysfunction in motility and secretion in IBS with diarrhea.

In light of predicted climate change and the global carbon cycle, the biomineralization ability of coccoliths has received growing interest. However, the underlying biomineralization mechanism is not yet well understood; the lack of non-invasive characterizing tools to obtain molecular level information involving biogenic processes and biomineral components remain significant challenges. In the present study, synchrotron-based Nano-computed Tomography (Nano-CT) and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy-Near-edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectromicroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS) techniques were employed to identify Ca spatial distribution and investigate the compositional chemistry and distinctive features of the association between biomacromolecules and mineral components of calcite present in coccoliths. The Nano-CT results show that the coccolith scale vesicle is similar as a continuous single channel. The mature coccoliths were intracellularly distributed and immediately ejected and located at the exterior surface to form a coccoshpere. The NEXAFS spectromicroscopy results of the Ca L edge clearly demonstrate the existence of two levels of gradients spatially, indicating two distinctive forms of Ca in coccoliths: a crystalline-poor layer surrounded by a relatively crystalline-rich layer. The results show that Sr is absorbed by the coccoliths and that Sr/Ca substitution is rather homogeneous within the coccoliths. Our findings indicate that synchrotron-based STXM-NEXAFS and Nano-CT are excellent tools for the study of biominerals and provide information to clarify biomineralization mechanism.

Currently, MoS2 NSs are considered as biocompatible NMs, but there is lacking of systemic investigations to study the interactions of MoS2 NSs with intestinal cells. In this study, we exposed the 3D Caco-2 spheroids to MoS2 NSs or MoS2 powders (denoted as MoS2-bulk), and investigated the potential adverse effects of MoS2-materials based on transcriptomics and lipidomics analysis. As expected, both MoS(2)NSs and MoS2 -bulk were dose-dependently internalized into 3D Caco-2 spheroids but did not induce cytotoxicity, membrane disruption or decrease of thiols. However, the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that nutrient absorption and metabolism was decreased. One of the most significantly decreased KEGG pathways is fat digestion and absorption (map04975), and Western blotting analysis further showed that fatty acid binding protein 1 and apolipoprotein Al, key proteins involved in fat digestion and absorption, were down-regulated by MoS2 NSs or MoS2-bulk. In addition, BODIPY 493/503 staining suggested that exposure to MoS2 NSs and MoS2-bulk decreased lipid levels in the spheroids. However, lipidomics data indicated that MoS2 materials only decreased 8 lipid classes, including Iysophosphatidylcholine, Iysodimethylphosphatidylethanolamine, N-acylethanolamine, ceramide phosphoethanolamines, gangliosides, lysosphingomyelin and sulfatide, whereas most of the lipid classes were indeed increased. In addition, MoS2 NSs was more potent to decrease the lipid classes compared with MoS2 -bulk. Combined, the results from this study showed that MoS2 NSs and bulk materials were non-cytotoxic but altered lipid profiles in 3D Caco-2 spheroids.

Isolated, sporadic and continuous permafrost belts are distributed from the southeast to the northwest in this area. Sixteen surface soil samples were collected from the three permafrost belts, and a 30-cm-deep soil profile was sampled from the continuous permafrost belt. A 70-cm-long sediment core was recovered from a small lake in the continuous permafrost belt. Measurements of mineral magnetism and analysis of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were performed on the soil samples, while mineral magnetism measurements, pollen analysis and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dating were made on the lake sediment samples. The purpose was to explore whether the mineral magnetism of the soils and sediments in combination with TOC, C/N and pollen data would be indicative of recent and past permafrost alterations. Stable single domain (SSD) ferrimagnets were rarer in relative and/or absolute terms in the surficial isolated-sporadic permafrost and the upper horizons of the soil profile, suggesting stronger gleization and thawing. The variations in TOC and C/N support these inferences. Temporal changes in mineral magnetism of the sediment core indicate varying pedogenesis and gleization and permafrost aggradations and degradations in the catchment and shifts of the permafrost belts over the past similar to 1000 years. The reconstructed permafrost alterations attributable to local climate changes suggested by the pollen data can be related to northern hemispheric and regional climate changes in the past similar to 1000 years and are helpful for predicting migrations of the permafrost belts in the future.

J	Li, S; Zhou, H; Hou, LY; Ren, ZY				Li, Shan; Zhou, Hua; Hou, Lingyun; Ren, Zhuyin			An analytic model for the effects of nitrogen dilution and premixing characteristics on NOx formation in turbulent premixed hydrogen flames	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Hydrogen gas turbine; Hydrogen premixed flame; Nitrogen dilution; N2O pathway; Low NOx emission	LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; GAS-TURBINE; H-2/CO/CH4 SYNGASES; HEAT-TRANSFER; EMISSIONS; CHEMISTRY	Advanced hydrogen gas turbine is a promising technology to achieve near-zero emission of carbon dioxide and higher cycle efficiency. With the increased firing temperature and pressure ratio, nitrogen reinjection combined with dry premixed combustion is promising to achieve the challenging low NOx emission. In this study, the effects of nitrogen dilution and fuel/air premixing characteristics on the flame characteristics and NOx emission are investigated first through simulating one-dimensional premixed flames with a 13-species and 39-reaction mechanism at the elevated engine operation conditions. The variation of flame thicknesses and laminar flame speeds with nitrogen dilution is investigated. The NOx formation is characterized by the flame-front NOx and the constant NOx formation rates in the post-flame region. It is shown that the flame-front NOx is an order of 1 ppm and does not change significantly (within 20%) with nitrogen dilution. In contrast, the NOx formation rates in the "post-flame region decrease monotonically with nitrogen dilution due to the decrease of oxygen concentration. A detailed analysis of NOx formation reveals that the N2O pathway is significant and it can account for at least 20% of the NOx formation in the post-flame region. Then an analytic model considering both the extended Zeldovich mechanism and the N2O pathway is constructed by assuming the involved radicals being in chemical equilibrium. The model can be employed to efficiently estimate the NOx formation in fully premixed hydrogen gas turbines. Next, the effects of fuel/air premixing characteristics on the mean NOx formation rate in the post-flame region are quantified by reconstructing the PDF of mixture fraction. It is shown that without the nitrogen dilution, the NOx formation rate increases dramatically with fuel/air unmixedness due to the existence of local hot spots. Nitrogen dilution can dramatically reduce the NOx formation rate at the same level of unmixedness through reducing the local hot spots. Moreover, nitrogen dilution reduces the sensitivity of the NOx formation rate to fuel/air unmixedness, which greatly alleviates the mixing requirement for the premixing nozzles in gas turbines.

SnO2-SiC hollow sphere nanochains with high surface area and gold nano-particles with good electroconductivity were fabricated onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode pre-coated with chitosan. The coating antigen (AA-4-mercaptophenylacetic acid-ovalbumin conjugate, AA-4-MPA-OVA) was immobilized on the electrode. Polyclonal antibody specific for AA-4-MPA was conjugated to gold nanorod (AuNR) as primary antibody (AuNR-Ab(1)). Horseradish peroxidase labelled anti-rabbit antibody produced in goat was conjugated to AuNR as secondary antibody (HRP-AuNR-Ab(2)). For detection, the analyte (AA-4-MPA) in sample competed with coating antigen for binding with AuNR-Ab1. After washing, HRP-AuNR-Ab(2) was added to capture the AuNR-Ab(1), and the electrical signal was obtained by addition of hydroquinone and H2O2. After investigation of the binding ability on nanomaterials and optimization of competitive immunoassay conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a sensitive response to AA with a detection limit of 45.9 +/- 2.7 ng kg(-1), and working range of 187 +/- 12.3 ng kg(-1) to 104 +/- 8.2 mu g kg(-1) for drinking water samples. Recoveries of AA from spiked samples were ranged from 86.0% to 115.0%. The specificity, repeatability and stability of the immunosensor were also proved to be acceptable, indicating its potential application in AA monitoring. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The high intrinsic activity is essential for the high-efficient Mo2C catalysts. Herein, transition metal (Ni, Co, or Fe)-Mo2C-embedded in N-doped carbon sheets grown on Ni foam (TM/Mo2CNCSs) are synthesized to enhance the intrinsic activity of Mo2C by optimizing the Mo-H bonding energy through the interfacial interactions between Ni, Co, or Fe, and Mo2C. Owing to the superior intrinsic activity, fast ternary channels, and abundant active sites, the Ni/Mo2C-NCSs possess the lowest overpotential for HER (131 mV) and the Fe/Mo2C-NCSs show the lowest overpotential for OER (293 mV) at a current density of 100 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH. The results analyzed with the Density function theory (DFT) calculation indicate that the most superior H adsorption site is at the interface between Mo2C and Ni hybrid. H was adsorbed on interface Mo&Ni@Ni/Mo2C with proper hydrogen adsorption free energies (Delta GH*), achieving a fast desorption process in HER. This mechanism is absent in the pristine Mo2C catalysts. An alkaline electrolyzer with a cathode of Ni/Mo2C-NCSs and anode of Fe/Mo2C-NCSs demonstrates a small voltage of 1.66 V at a current density of 100 mA cm-2. This work offers an elaborated strategy of interface engineering to enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity of Mo2C by accelerating H2 desorption in HER and enhancing the catalytic kinetics of OER simultaneously.

Negative imaginary parts of complex permeability and microwave absorption performance of core double-shelled FeCo/C/Fe2.5Cr0.5Se4 nanocomposites	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC-WAVE ABSORPTION; GIGAHERTZ RANGE; X-BAND; COMPOSITES; FERRITE; NANOSTRUCTURES; NICKEL; ALPHA-FE/FE3B/Y2O3; FECO/Y2O3; PROPERTY	Cactus-shaped core double-shelled FeCo/C/Fe2.5Cr0.5Se4 nanostructures with a spiky surface were prepared by combining an arc-discharge process with a high-temperature solution chemical method, in which FeCo nanoparticles serve as the, while carbon and ferrimagnetic Fe2.5Cr0.5Se4 (FCS) are the inside and the outside shells, respectively. The magnetic properties, electromagnetic response, and microwave absorption properties of the (x) FeCo/C/FCS nanocomposites in the 1-18 GHz frequency range were investigated by changing the mass ratio x between FeCo/C and FCS. The frequency dependences of mu '' (imaginary parts of complex permeability) and epsilon '' (imaginary parts of complex permittivity) of the (0 <= x <= 0.15) FeCo/C/FCS nanocomposites show distinct inverse trends of change in the high frequency ranges. Negative minimum values of mu '' are found to be coupled with positive maxima of 300 due to a phase lag. The bare FCS-paraffin composite starts with a minimum mu '' of about -0.07, which shifts to -0.44 and -0.05 when the mass ratio x is increased to 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. As x increases to 0.2, all the mu '' values of the nanocomposites become positive. The best absorption property with a reflection loss (RL) peak of -54.5 dB at 10 GHz is obtained in the (x = 0.1) FeCo/C/FCS-paraffin composite and RL exceeding -20 dB can be achieved within the 3-18 GHz frequency range by choosing an appropriate layer thickness between 1.4 and 6 mm. The contribution of the negative mu '' response to the microwave absorption is discussed.	[Li, D.; Feng, Y.; Pan, D. S.; Jiang, L. W.; Dai, Z. M.; Li, S. J.; Liu, W.; Zhang, Z.

Root ultrastructure of Moso bamboo was studied by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Application of 200 mu M Cu resulted in an accumulation of 810 mg kg(-1) dry weight and 91 mg kg(-1) dry weight Cu in roots and shoots, respectively. The majority of the plants did not survive the application of 400 mu M Cu. Biomass production declined consistently with application of each additional increment of Cu. Root growth was more severely inhibited than shoot growth. Cu adversely affected the root morphology of the plants, however, root surface area and number of root tips increased slightly at low levels of Cu. Root cell ultrastructure and organelles changed significantly under Cu stress, in particular, cell walls, mitochondria, and xylem parenchyma were affected.

Herein, we report a synergetic strategy by combining ex situ chemical pretreatment on lithium metal anodes (LMAs) and in situ cationic polymerization of DOL to tackle these issues. LiDFOB is unprecedentedly employed as the initiator to launch the in situ fabrication of poly-DOL gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), resulting in integrated ionic connections between the electrodes and electrolyte. Furthermore, robust and compatible interfaces are successfully constructed via pretreatment of LMAs and establishment of a LiDFOB-LiTFSI dual-salt system in quasi-solid lithium metal batteries (QSLMBs). Consequently, both the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) containing N- , F- , and B-rich inorganic components are formed on the anode and cathode. The novel poly-DOL GPE exhibits excellent compatibility with various intercalating cathodes, such as LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 and LiCoO2. This work provides a facile and accessible approach to manufacture qualified LMBs with improved safety and elongated lifetime.

J	Ogunkoya, D; Li, S; Rojas, OJ; Fang, TG				Ogunkoya, Dolanimi; Li, Shuai; Rojas, Orlando J.; Fang, Tiegang			Performance, combustion, and emissions in a diesel engine operated with fuel-in-water emulsions based on lignin	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Fuel emulsions; Oil-in-water emulsion; Lignin; Stabilizer; Diesel engine combustion; Emissions	3-PHASE EMULSIONS; BIO-DIESEL; OIL; ETHANOL; BUTANOL	We report for the first time on the use of water-continuous emulsions stabilized by a bio-based macromolecule in a compression-ignition diesel engine and compare their performance, combustion and emissions against the base fuels (diesel, biodiesel, and jet fuel). For this purpose, high internal phase ratio emulsions (70:30 fuel-to-water) were produced by mechanical emulsification using carboxymethylated wood lignin as stabilizer. Combusting experiments were performed with the engine operating at 2000 rpm under three loads (0, 1.26 and 3.26 bar brake mean effective pressure, BMEP). Engine performance, in-cylinder combustion, and exhaust emissions were monitored and compared for the fuels tested. At no load condition and when compared to the respective base (single phase) fuels, an increase in the indicated work was observed for diesel and biodiesel emulsions. Compared to the base fuels, the emulsions resulted in higher engine mechanical efficiency at 1.26 and 3.26 bar BMEP except for jet fuel emulsion at 1.26 bar. Additionally, they displayed a lower brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), if calculated on the basis of effective fuel content discounting emulsion water, and higher brake thermal efficiency. Compared to the base fuel, the respective emulsions generally presented lower peak in-cylinder pressure, lower heat release rates, and longer ignition delays at 1.26 bar and 3.26 bar BMEP; the opposite effect was observed at no-load conditions. Remarkably, a large reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions was noted in the combustion of the fuel emulsions, which was accompanied with a relatively higher carbon monoxide (CO) release at 1.26 and 3.26 bar (at 0 bar BMEP, the emulsions produced less CO emissions). The effect of emulsions on hydrocarbon emissions and smoke opacity depended on the fuel type and the engine load. Overall, it is concluded that while reports on fuel emulsions involve oil-continuous systems, the proposed water-continuous alternative represents an opportunity for diesel engines, whereby the fuel is dispersed as micrometric droplets for improved combustion and reduced emissions. At the same time, the fuel emulsion formulation takes advantage of the surface activity and high calorific value of widely available, inexpensive lignin stabilizers, making the proposed system a viable option towards cleaner or fully bio-based fuels.

In this study, a two-year field experiment of spring maize was conducted from 2014 to 2015 in northwest China. Five treatments were designed, including one local farmer practice (I480-4N280, 280 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer and irrigated 480 mm with four irrigation events) and four conservation treatments (I420-4N200, I420-5N200, I420-6N200 and I420-7N200, standing for 200 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer and irrigated 420 mm with four to seven irrigation events, respectively). Measured yield, leaf area index, soil water content and soil nitrate concentration were used to evaluate a soil-crop model (WHCNS, soil Water Heat Carbon Nitrogen Simulator), which was then used to simulate the effects of water and N management practices on water consumption, N fates, and crop growth. Then, the integrated index considering the agronomic, economic, and environmental impacts was simulated using 35,100 combinations of irrigation and fertilizer N scenarios, which were designed to develop BMPs under different ISMN levels (ranging from 0 to 625 kg N ha(-1) in a 1.8 m-soil profile) and seasons of weather data (from 2001 to 2015). Results showed I420-5N200 was the best with a high yield, WUE and NUE, and low N loss among five treatments. The optimal irrigation amount (ranging from 350 - 600 mm) was related to precipitation amount. The optimal N rate decreased linearly with the increase of ISMN when ISMN was < 384 kg ha(-1), and reached a plateau (0 kg N ha(-1)) when ISMN was > 384 kg ha(-1). In this study, we developed a simple linear model to determine the best N application rates under different ISMNs. This method is important to help farmers achieve multiple goals of high yield, resource conservation and reduced environmental impacts simultaneously.

Microsatellite primer resource for Populus developed from the mapped sequence scaffolds of the Nisqually-1 genome	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						allelic variability; amplification rate; microsatellites; Populus; simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers	MUTATION-RATE; GC CONTENT; CONSERVATION; LENGTH; RATES; TRI; DI	In this study, 148 428 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs were designed from the unambiguously mapped sequence scaffolds of the Nisqually-1 genome. The physical position of the priming sites were identified along each of the 19 Populus chromosomes, and it was specified whether the priming sequences belong to intronic, intergenic, exonic or UTR regions. A subset of 150 SSR loci were amplified and a high amplification success rate (72%) was obtained in P. tremuloides, which belongs to a divergent subgenus of Populus relative to Nisqually-1. PCR reactions showed that the amplification success rate of exonic primer pairs was much higher than that of the intronic/intergenic primer pairs. Applying ANOVA and regression analyses to the flanking sequences of microsatellites, the repeat lengths, the GC contents of the repeats, the repeat motif numbers, the repeat motif length and the base composition of the repeat motif, it was determined that only the base composition of the repeat motif and the repeat motif length significantly affect the microsatellite variability in P. tremuloides samples. The SSR primer resource developed in this study provides a database for selecting highly transferable SSR markers with known physical position in the Populus genome and provides a comprehensive genetic tool to extend the genome sequence of Nisqually-1 to genetic studies in different Populus species.

Herein, we fabricated binderless ZnNiP electrode based on Ni metal-organic framework and the optimized Zn-doping process, which achieved high electrochemical performance both in hybrid supercapacitor and Zn battery. Encouragingly, the addition of Zn source and the phosphating process make a component synergy with enhanced electronic conductivity, enriched electrochemical active centers and redox reactions. The ZnNiP-0.5 with sturdy construction exhibits a remarkable specific capacity and a good cycling stability in alkaline electrolyte. When assembled to hybrid supercapacitor, the installation delivers a maximum energy density of 67.4 Wh kg(-1), a maximum power density of 15.9 kW kg(-1), and outstanding cycling performance (88% retention after 10 000 cycles). Additionally, the fabricated Zn battery could achieve discharge voltage of similar to 1.9 V, with an admirable energy density of 529.58 Wh kg(-1) and also shows the excellent durability (capacity retention of 91.6% after 3000 cycles). This work offers a feasible route and provides a certain guiding significance for the reasonable design of binder-free electrodes with delicate structures and compositions, which may inspire new significative findings of building electrodes for high-security hybrid supercapacitors and alkaline batteries.

In this study, Fe(III) replacement/diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) precipitation combined process is proposed as a promising strategy to achieve the deep purification of Cu(II) from Cu(II)-EDTA acidic wastewater. The underlying mechanism has also been systematically elucidated by chemical equilibriums, experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, laying a foundation for the development and application. Chemical equilibriums show that Fe(III) replacement favors the stoichiometric release of Cu(II) from Cu(II)-EDTA and the formation of Fe(III)-EDTA complex under acidic conditions. Experimentally, Cu(II) is removed (over 99.99%) and deeply purified (under 0.008 mg/L) under the optimal conditions, which is lower than the most stringent discharge standards of copper ions in electroplating effluent (< 0.5 mg/L, China). DFT calculations reveal that DDTC could further precipitate the released free copper ions via the carbon disulfide (-C(=S)-S) chelating group while exhibiting a slight effect on the Fe(III) in Fe(III)-EDTA. Considering these results, the electronic structures of Cu(II) and Fe(III), as well as their interaction with EDTA and DDTC ligands, are discussed to understand the mechanism of Fe(III)/DDTC process. By introducing a low dosage of Fe(III), the DDTC could efficiently purify Cu(II) from the Cu(II)-EDTA acid wastewater and realize the near-zero discharge of metal pollutants in metal-organic complex wastewater. It is believed that the main findings may benefit the water pollution reduction and comprehensive recycling of metal resources.

Nevertheless, the response of the physicochemical indicators of surface sediments to oasis-desert evolution is poorly studied and it is unclear how reliable these indicators are for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. A spatio-temporal approach consisting of measurements of surface-sediment grain-size, nutrient contents and elemental ratios was used to characterize a series of modern stages of oasis-desert evolution in the Taklimakan desert. The applicability of the indicators to two sequences of alternating fluviolacustrine-wetland and aeolian sand deposits in the same region was evaluated. The results show that the oasis sediments are characterized by high contents of fine-grained particle (End-Member 1, EM1), TOC (Total organic Carbon), TN (Total Nitrogen), and MgO/SiO2, and low values of the eluvial coefficient (SiO2/(MgO + CaO + K2O + Na2O)). By contrast, the desert sediments are characterized by high values of coarse-grained particle (End-Member 3, EM3), low soil nutrients and MgO/SiO2, and an increased eluvial coefficient. In the two sedimentary sections, the physicochemical properties of the clay-silt layers resemble those of modern oasis sediments, especially washland, and the properties of the interbedded aeolian sand resemble those of modern desert deposits. The observed co-variation of grain size, soil nutrients and geochemical ratios of the surface samples shows that our approach can be used to determine the trends of past oasis-desert evolution. The reconstruction suggests that oasis formation largely depended on the development of a fluviolacustrine-wetland environment, whereas oasis degradation was closely related to strong aeolian activity. The findings provide new insights into the selection of appropriate indicators for analyzing oasis-desert sediments and for reconstructing the evolution of oasis-desert landscapes.

The dehumidifier was used in an existing liquid-desiccant evaporative cooling-assisted 100% outdoor air system (LD-IDECOAS) using both direct and indirect evaporative coolers. The ventilation efficiency of the LD-IDECOAS was also measured via a tracer-gas test with carbon dioxide. The concentrations of two representative VOCs, toluene and formaldehyde, the number of particles with various sizes, and the colony-forming units of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi in the process air were measured before and after liquid-desiccant dehumidification. Then, the measurement results were compared with those acquired by bypassing the liquid-desiccant unit in order to verify the impact of the liquid desiccant on air-contaminant removal. The experimental results showed that the removal efficiency of the LD unit was 36% for toluene, and 29.6% for formaldehyde. The particle removal efficiencies measured as part of this research were 48.2%, 64.1%, and 84.9% for the particle sizes of 2.5-5 mu m, 5-10 mu m, and 10-25 mu m, respectively. The bacteria-removal efficiency was 77.5% and 81.3% for the sampling process air of 200 and 500 L, respectively, while the fungi removal efficiency was 38.8% and 44.4% for 200 and 500 L of sampling process air, respectively.

This facility delivers carbon ion beams with kinetic energies up to 400 MeV/u for clinical applications. The beam diagnostics system for HIMM is based on 18 different types of monitors and is used to measure all relevant beam parameters from the ion source to the irradiation therapy terminals which are critical for the commissioning of the accelerator as well as during the regular operation to ensure high up-time of the machine. The control system for all the monitors is designed, developed and implemented globally based on a 3-tier architecture with the aim to achieve a clear separation between front-end devices and their controllers. This paper presents the architecture, the design principle and the implementation of this control system. The beam parameters measured based on the detectors' motion control and data acquisition control system are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, this beam diagnostics control system (BDCS) will be transplanted to the next heavy ion medical machine in Lanzhou city on account of the successful application in Wuwei city, the precise beam parameters measurement, and long term operation with high stability and reliability.

Metal oxides containing multiple components are promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); but their development demands exhaustive experiments, resulting in long term cycles and high cost in research. In this paper, a high-throughput experimental scheme is employed for searching effective OER oxide electrocatalysts. Combining inkjet printing technology and scanning electrochemical microscopy, a material library of Mn-Co-Fe-Ni oxide is rapidly prepared and its OER activity is screened. The composition of Mn5Co10Fe30Ni55Ox has been found to exhibit the highest catalytic activity. Nanowire catalyst of the corresponding composition has been prepared by electrospinning method, which achieves a low overpotential of 280 mV at current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 60.4 mV.dec(-1).

Glucose in animals and sucrose in plants serve as the dominant distribution forms. Cellular sugar uptake and release require vesicular and/or plasma membrane transport proteins. Humans and plants use proteins from three superfamilies for sugar translocation: the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the sodium solute symporter family (SSF; only in the animal kingdom), and SWEETs1-5. SWEETs carry mono-and disaccharides(6) across vacuolar or plasma membranes. Plant SWEETs play key roles in sugar translocation between compartments, cells, and organs, notably in nectar secretion(7), phloem loading for long distance translocation(8), pollen nutrition(9), and seed filling(10). Plant SWEETs cause pathogen susceptibility possibly by sugar leakage from infected cells(3,11,12). The vacuolar Arabidopsis thaliana AtSWEET2 sequesters sugars in root vacuoles; loss-of-function mutants show increased susceptibility to Pythium infection(13). Here we show that its orthologue, the vacuolar glucose transporter OsSWEET2b from rice (Oryza sativa), consists of an asymmetrical pair of triple-helix bundles, connected by an inversion linker transmembrane helix (TM4) to create the translocation pathway. Structural and biochemical analyses show OsSWEET2b in an apparent inward (cytosolic) open state forming homomeric trimers. TM4 tightly interacts with the first triple-helix bundle within a protomer and mediates key contacts among protomers. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the close paralogue SWEET1 from Arabidopsis identified key residues in substrate translocation and protomer crosstalk. Insights into the structure-function relationship of SWEETs are valuable for understanding the transport mechanism of eukaryotic SWEETs and may be useful for engineering sugar flux.

Herein, we report a flower-like of MoS2-based hybrid photocatalyst with high efficiency through nanostructure and electronic structure engineering. Nanostructure control is used to fabricate MoS2 in to flower-like nanosheets (NSs) with large surface active area. Then MoS2 is coupled with conduction-band edge matched tin dioxide (SnO2) and decorated with Ag nanoparticles for suitable work function to create a unique cascade band alignment electronic structure to facilitate photoexcited charge transfer. It is shown that the amount-optimized nanocomposite of SnO2/Ag/MoS2 exhibits exceptional visible-light photocatalytic activities for conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), approximately one order of magnitude enhancement than original MoS2 with the apparent quantum efficiency 2.38% at 420 nm. Similarly, the optimized sample also shows high activities for 2,4-diclorophenol, Methylene-Blue, Rhodamine-B and Methyl-Orange degradation as compared to pure MoS2. It is clearly demonstrated through combination of hydroxyl radical evaluation, photoelectrochemical and electrochemical impedance, that the enhanced photoactivities are attributed to the increased specific surface area, optimized band alignment for charge transfer and suppressed recombination. Our current work provides feasible routes for further research.	[Khan, Bilawal; Raziq, Fazal; Faheem, M.

We report sulfur composite electrodes prepared by the mechanical milling of sulfur, Ketjen black, and P2S5 or Na3PS4 for high-capacity cells. A cell using P2S5, which is not ion conductive, in the sulfur electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 340 mAh (g-sulfur electrode)(-1) at 0.04 C rate at 25 degrees C, which is much larger than that (37.3 mAh (g-sulfur electrode)(-1)) obtained in a conventional cell using a high ion-conductive Na3PS4 electrolyte. To investigate the reaction mechanism of the sulfur composite electrode containing P2S5, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM) observations of the electrodes were conducted. The results indicate that a crystalline Na3PS4 component is automatically produced by the electrochemical reaction with Na in the amorphous S-P2S5 electrode and it mixing with the sulfur redox parts at the nanoscale. The mixing degree is higher than that at microscale in the conventional S-Na3PS4 electrode, which results in the high capacity of the cells containing the S-P2S5 electrode. Partial substitution of P2S5 for SiS2 in the sulfur electrode suppresses the nanocrystallization and further increases the reversible capacity up to 390 mAh (g-sulfur electrode)(-1) under 0.04 C rate, which is the highest in reported all-solid-state Na batteries to date.

The overloaded nutrients have adverse ecological consequences, such as causing eutrophication of waters and soil in urban areas. Studying the ecophysiology of nutrient-cycling microbes in urban areas is the foundation to explore strategies for removing such excessive nutrients. The phyllosphere is an understudied microbial habitat for examining how the urban microbiome responds to common environmental changes, such as hydrological perturbations. Here, we investigated how successive rainy-sunny cycles within a season affect the genetic potential (gene abundances) for leaf nutrient cycling and particularly the functional potential (enzyme activities) for leaf denitrification of the greening tree Photinia fraseri. Of 41 detected C, N, P, and sulfur (S) cycling genes using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction, rainfalls only significantly (p < 0.05) increased the abundances of denitrification marker genes nirK and nirS and one C-fixation gene on the phyllosphere while having no significant impacts on other nutrient-cycling genes. The nirK and nirS genes encode nitrite reductases, which catalyze the hallmark step of the denitrification process. Further, a denitrification enzyme activity assay of phyllosphere microbiota showed that, in comparison to sunny weather, rainfalls significantly promoted nitrate reduction (5.48 mu mol of NO3- g-1 h-1; p < 0.001) and N2O production (2.07 nmol of N2O g-1 h-1; p < 0.05) rates, respectively. Together, this study revealed that hydrological perturbations can affect tree phyllosphere denitrification. Understating the ecophysiology of urban phyllosphere denitrifying microbes might be important for developing suitable phylloremediation strategies to attenuate urban N inputs.

Here, multifunctional chitosan hybrid nanoparticles (denoted as FA-CS-FITC(DOX/C-dots)/VEGF shRNA) containing folic acid (FA), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and doxorubicin (DOX)/carbon quantum dots (C-dots)/VEGF shRNA were fabricated as a targeted drug/gene co-delivery nanovector for potential cancer therapy and fluorescence imaging. The self-assembled FA-CS-FITC(DOX/C-dots)/VEGF shRNA nanocomplexes exhibited a desirable and homogenous particle size (154 +/- 24 nm), moderate positive charges (23.2 +/- 1.8 mV) and superior stability. The nanocomplexes without noteworthy cytotoxicity are capable of delivering VEGF shRNA into human cervical cancer HeLa cells with high efficiency while effectively protecting shRNA from degradation by exogenous DNase I and nucleases. The release behavior of DOX exhibited a biphasic pattern characterized by an initial burst release followed by a slower and continuous release at both pH 7.4 and pH 4.5, and also presented a pH-triggered release profile. Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed that both FA-targeted function and FA-enhanced buffering capacity induced high transfection, specific cellular uptake and efficient intracellular delivery of FA-CS-FITC(DOX/C-dots)/VEGF shRNA nanocomplexes in folate receptor-overexpressed HeLa cells. Transfected HeLa cells exhibited significantly decreased VEGF expression, inhibited cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis, which led to synergistic antitumor activities. Furthermore, the nanocomplexes demonstrated excellent dual fluorescence cellular imaging at a modest concentration. This work indicates that the integrated theranostic design of FA-CS-FITC(DOX/C-dots)/VEGF shRNA nanocomplexes potentially allows for the image-guided and target-specific treatment of cancer.

Scattering properties of soot-containing particles and their impact by humidity in 1.6 mu m	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Scattering properties; Relative humidity; Soot-containing particle; T-matrix method; CMGMM	DIFFERENCE TIME-DOMAIN; LIGHT-SCATTERING; HYGROSCOPIC PROPERTIES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING; RADIATIVE PROPERTIES; MULTIPLE-SCATTERING; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; METAL GLASSES; EM WAVES	Short-wave infrared (SWIR) band in wavelength near 1.6 mu m is one of the key bands used for satellite observation of Carbon Dioxide (CO2). However, one major uncertainty to use this band for the CO2 retrieval is the scattering by cloud and aerosol particles. To better understand the scattering properties of soot-containing particles in this band, this paper studied the scattering properties for three typical types of soot-containing particles in China: (I) internal mixture, (II) pure soot aggregate, and (III) semi-external 'mixture. Assumed as single non-spherical particle for type I, its scattering property is computed using the T-matrix method combined with the Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory and the hygroscopic growth theory. For types II and III, a particle-cluster aggregation algorithm is employed to generate fractal-like aggregates, and their scattering properties are computed using the Core-Mantle Generalized Multi-sphere Mie-solution method combined with the hygroscopic growth theory of both monomers and aggregated particles. The simulated results demonstrate that their scattering properties are quite different and strongly impacted by the levels of relative humidity (RH). For type I, the RH plays a much more important role than the morphology in impacting the scattering properties, and the scattering phase functions among different shaped particles have a larger difference for larger particles and higher RH. For type II, both the RH and morphology significantly affect its scattering properties. The single scattering albedo (omega) can be underestimated up to similar to 50% without considering the effects of RH and morphological changes. For type III, its scattering properties mainly depend on the RH and the size of the large water-soluble particle. Although the enlarged soot aggregate, which is attached to a water-soluble particle, almost does not change the light direction, it can result in a significant reduction in omega (similar to 0.15) at low RH for small particles. By comparing the scattering parameters of wet particles at a certain RH level with the dry ones, the impact by the heterogeneity of aerosols generally becomes larger with the increase of RH, but becomes smaller with the increase of particle size. These results suggest that, although the water vapor absorption itself is small in 1.6 pm CO2 band, it can significantly impact the scattering properties of these particles through its effect on the hygroscopic growth of the non-spherical and heterogeneous aerosols. This impact should be taken into account in the retrieval of CO2 using 1.6 mu m as well as other related remote sensing applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The current study showed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5), microRNA-23a (miR-23a), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) play important roles in the pathological process of hepatic fibrosis but have a relatively unclear regulatory mechanism. This study aimed to investigate the roles of lncRNA GAS5, miR-23a, and PTEN in the pathological process of hepatic fibrosis and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. We used carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) intraperitoneal injections to establish a rat hepatic fibrosis model and exogenous transforming growth factor-beta 1 to establish an HSC activation model. Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, dual-luciferase reporter system, and RNA pull-down assays were used to investigate which microRNAs and lncRNAs participate in the process of hepatic fibrosis and HSC activation. miR-23a expression increased significantly in hepatic fibrosis tissues and activated HSCs. miR-23a interaction with and degradation of PTEN further influenced the downstream signaling pathway phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin/Snail (PI3K/Akt/mTOR/Snail), causing E-cadherin expression levels to decrease and alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen I expression levels to increase. lncRNA GAS5 can be used as a sponge platform for miR-23a to decrease miR-23a expression levels competitively. We revealed the role of the lncRNA GAS5/miR-23a/PTEN/PI3K/Akt/mTOR/Snail signaling pathway in hepatic fibrosis, providing molecular targets for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study revealing that microRNA-23a (miR-23a) promotes hepatic fibrosis through the phosphatase and tensin homolog/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin/Snail signaling pathway, and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) can act as a sponge platform for miR-23a. Therefore, lncRNA GAS5/miR-23a may bring molecular targets for hepatic fibrosis therapy.

However, no study on the mutagenic effect of argon (Ar) ion beam radiation on rice has been reported. Genome-wide studies on induced mutations are important to comprehend their characteristics for establishing knowledge-based protocols for mutation induction and breeding, which are still very limited in rice. The present study aimed to investigate the mutagenic effect of three ion beams, i.e., Ar, carbon (C) and neon (Ne) on rice and identify and characterize heritable induced mutations by the whole genome sequencing of six M-4 plants. Dose-dependent damage effects were observed on M-1 plants, which were developed from ion beam irradiated dry seeds of two indica (LH15, T23) and two japonica (DS551, DS48) rice lines. High frequencies of chlorophyll-deficient seedlings and male-sterile plants were observed in all M-2 populations (up to similar to 30% on M-1 plant basis); plants from the seeds of different panicles of a common M-1 plant appeared to have different mutations; the whole genome-sequencing demonstrated that there were 236-453 mutations in each of the six M-4 plants, including single base substitutions (SBSs) and small insertion/deletions (InDels), with the number of SBSs similar to 4-8 times greater than that of InDels; SBS and InDel mutations were distributed across different genomic regions of all 12 chromosomes, however, only a small number of mutations (0-6) were present in exonic regions that might have an impact on gene function. In summary, the present study demonstrates that Ar, C and Ne ion beam radiation are all effective for mutation induction in rice and has revealed at the genome level the characteristics of the mutations induced by the three ion beams. The findings are of importance to the efficient use of ion beam radiation for the generation and utilization of mutants in rice.

This study was designed to reveal the mechanism underlying renal injury induced by Se deficiency in pigs. Twenty-four castrated male Yorkshire pigs were divided into two groups fed either a Se-deficient diet (0.007 mg Se per kg) or a Se-adequate diet (0.3 mg Se per kg). Serum and kidney samples were collected at the 16th week of the trial, processed, and analyzed for serum biochemistry, Se concentration, kidney index markers, histology, selenoprotein mRNA expression, redox status, and inflammatory cytokines. Dietary Se deficiency induced kidney injury, decreased (P< 0.05) Se concentrations, and increased (P< 0.05) kidney index and serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and carbon dioxide values. Histological analysis indicated that Se deficiency induced inflammatory lesions and renal tubular atrophy in the renal medulla. Se deficiency downregulated (P< 0.05) nine selenoprotein genes (GPX1,SELENOW,SELENOH,SELENOP,GPX3,TXNRD2,SELENOI,SELENON, andSELENOM) and upregulated (P< 0.05)SEPHS2in the kidneys. Se deficiency decreased (P< 0.05) the activity of glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and catalase, as well as the hydroxyl radical inhibition capacity, and increased (P< 0.05) the content of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide. Se deficiency increased (P< 0.05) the expression of the transcription factors NF-kappa B and HIF-1 alpha, and regulated inflammatory cytokines. Se deficiency increased (P< 0.05) the expression of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, and cyclooxygenase-2, and decreased (P< 0.05) the expression of IL-10, IL-13, and TGF-beta. These results indicated that Se deficiency induces kidney injury through the regulation of selenoproteins, oxidative stress, and inflammation.

Field emission scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, and transmission electron microscope studies reveal that ZnO nanorod arrays feature a perfect crystalline wurtzite structure and grow preferentially along [0001] direction. The antireflective performance of ZnO nanorod arrays is confirmed by Fresnel coefficient matrix method and MATLAB software calculation. Furthermore, PC1D simulation demonstrates that the photovoltaic property for c-Si solar cells of the pyramid-textured front surface using ZnO nanorod arrays as an antireflective layer is much better than that for the other three types of c-Si solar cells (i.e., c-Si solar cells of the pyramid-textured front surface without using any antireflective layer, c-Si solar cells of the planar front surface using ZnO nanorod arrays as an antireflective layer, as well as c-Si solar cells of the planar front surface without using any antireflective layer). In particular, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 20.23% has been achieved for c-Si solar cells of the pyramid-textured front surface using ZnO nanorod arrays as an antireflective layer. This work is highly relevant to the development of an advanced process for the realization of high-efficiency, low-cost, and stable solar cells.

Under zinc stress, the seed germination rate did not show significant difference from that of the control. Hydroponics experiments indicated that Moso bamboo had a strong ability to accumulate Zn in the shoot and it reached its maximum value in the shoot at 100 mu M Zn. The root Zn concentration ranged from 2,329.29 to 8,642.51 mg kg(-1), with the root Zn concentration at 10 mu M Zn being 58.23 times that of the control. The root morphology parameters slightly increased at the lower Zn treatments, while growth restriction was evident at higher Zn treatments. Root ultrastructural studies revealed that the cell structure, root tips, and organelles were significantly changed under Zn stress as compared to those of the control. Some abnormalities were evident in the cell walls, vacuoles, mitochondria, plasmalemma, tonoplast, and xylem parenchyma of root cells. While Moso bamboo seems a suitable candidate for phytoremediation, its metal remediation ability should be further explored in future investigations.

The compatibility of electrode-electrolyte interface is a critical factor influencing the electrochemical performance of ASSLMBs. Herein, we propose a plastic super-conductive carrier to deter untoward reaction between Li anode and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3) (LAGP) electrolyte by in-situ solidifying succinonitrile-based plastic interlayer with Li6.4La3Zr2Al0.24O12 (LLZAO) nanowires (l-SN). The method of in-situ solidification promises the low interfacial resistance. The l-SN interlayer can not only act as a physical obstacle to isolate LAGP pellet from Li metal, but also provide three-dimensional ion channels to regulate the transfer of Li ions, delivering an uniform Li ion distribution for dendrite-free Li deposition. The Li vertical bar 1-SN vertical bar LAGP vertical bar 1-SN vertical bar Li symmetric cell can stably cycle for 240 h without short circuit at room temperature (R.T). This approach enables a high specific capacity of 152.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C for Li vertical bar 1-SN vertical bar LAGP vertical bar 1-SN vertical bar LiFePO4 cells at R.T. Furthermore, the integrated ASSLMBs show excellent cyclic stability at 40 degrees C with an initial discharge capacity of 168.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and retention of 93.17% after 100 cycles. The super-ionic property at the interface makes excellent rate performance of ASSLMBs at 40 degrees C. This strategy is facile and efficient in promising safe and outstanding ASSLMBs and also has some referential values for other unstable electrolyte interface beyond LAGP.

Cremophor EL as a solubilizer, PEG 400 as a latent solvent, and mannitol as an excipient were mixed to increase the solubility of GB in water to more than 18 times (about from 2.5 x 10(-4) mol/L (0.106 mg/mL) to 1.914 mg/mL). Formulation screening was conducted by orthogonal design where the content of GB in the solution before lyophilization (using external standard method of HPLC) and reconstitution time after lyophilization were the two evaluation indexes. The optimized formulations were GB in an amount of 2 mg/mL, Cremophor EL in an amount of 16% (v/v), PEG 400 in an amount of 9% (v/v), mannitol in an amount of 8% (w/v), and the solution pH of 6.5. Through four single-factor experiments (GB adding order, preparation temperature of GB solution, adding amount, and adsorption time of activated carbon), the preparation process of GB solution was confirmed. The glass transition temperature of maximally GB freeze-concentrated solution was - 17.6A degrees C through the electric resistance method. GB lyophilized powder began to collapse at - 14.0A degrees C, and the fully collapsed temperature was - 13.0A degrees C, which were determined by freeze-drying microscope. When the collapse temperature was determined, the primary drying temperature was obtained. Thereby, the freeze-drying curve of GB lyophilized powder was initially identified. The freeze-drying process was optimized by orthogonal design, the qualified product appearance and residual moisture content were the two evaluation indexes. The optimized process parameters and process were (1) shelf temperature, decreased from room temperature to - 45.0A degrees C, at 0.5A degrees C/min in 2 h; (2) shelf temperature increased from - 45.0 to - 25.0A degrees C, at 0.1A degrees C/min, maintained for 3 h, and the chamber pressure was held at 10 Pa; (3) shelf temperature was increased from - 25.0 to - 15.0A degrees C at 0.1 A degrees C/min, maintained for 4 h, and the chamber pressure was held at 10 Pa; and (4) shelf temperature was increased from - 15.0 to 20.0A degrees C at 1.0 A degrees C/min, maintained for 4 h, and the chamber pressure was raised up to 80 Pa. In these lyophilization process conditions, the products complied with relevant provisions of the lyophilized powders for injection. Meanwhile, the reproducibility was satisfactory. Post-freezing annealing had no significantly beneficial effects on shortening the freeze-drying cycle and improving the quality of GB lyophilized powder.

Herbicide sorption coefficients in relation to soil properties and terrain attributes on a cultivated prairie	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SPATIAL VARIABILITY; ORGANIC-MATTER; 2,4-D SORPTION; GLYPHOSATE; LANDSCAPE; ADSORPTION; GROUNDWATER; DEGRADATION; PESTICIDES; EROSION	The sorption of 2,4-D and glyphosate herbicides in soil was quantified for 287 surface soils (0-15 cm) collected in a 10 X 10 in grid across a heavily eroded, undulating, calcareous prairie landscape. Other variables that were determined included soil carbonate content, soil pH, soil organic carbon content (SOC), soil texture, soil loss or gain by tillage and water erosion, and selected terrain attributes and landform segments. The 2,4-D sorption coefficient (K-d) was significantly associated with soil carbonate content (-0.66; P < 0.001), soil pH (-0.63; P < 0.001), and SOC (0.47; P < 0.001). Upper slopes were strongly eroded and thus had a significantly greater soil carbonate content and less SOC compared with lower slopes that were in soil accumulation zones. The 2,4-D Kd was almost twice as small in upper slopes than in lower slopes. The 2,4-D K-d, was also significantly associated with nine terrain attributes, particularly with compounded topographic index (0.59; P < 0.00 1), gradient (-0.48; P < 0.001), mean curvature (-0.43; P < 0.001), and plan curvature (-0.42 P < 0.001). Regression equations were generated to estimate herbicide sorption in soils. The predicted power of these equations increased for 2,4-D when selected terrain attributes were combined with soil properties. In contrast, the variation of glyphosate sorption across the field was much less dependent on our measured soil properties and calculated terrain attributes. We conclude that the integration of terrain attributes or landform segments in pesticide fate modeling is more advantageous for herbicides such as 2,4-D, whose sorption to soil is weak and influenced by subtle changes in soil properties, than for herbicides such as glyphosate that are strongly bound to soil regardless of soil properties.

In this paper, we fabricated industrially high-efficiency solar cells based on both uncompensated and compensated n-type silicon. Moreover, we measured the impact of temperature on the photovoltaic performance of aluminum-alloyed back-junction n-type silicon solar cells. Compared with conventional front-junction solar cells, the back-junction silicon solar cells have a lower absolute temperature coefficient especially for moderate carrier diffusion lengths which is attributed to distinctive spectral response, stronger dependence on carrier diffusion lengths, and incomplete ionization of aluminum. In addition, the lowest absolute temperature coefficient is obtained on this type of aluminum-alloyed back-junction solar cell when the compensated silicon is used as the base layer. These results suggest that aluminum-alloyed back-junction solar cells especially based on the compensated silicon can generate more electricity at a high temperature, and therefore, as a cost-effective production of silicon solar cells, this type of solar cells have a very good potential for actual outdoor application. This work is highly relevant to the development of an advanced process for the achievement of low-cost, high-efficiency, commercially viable silicon-based solar cells.

Here, we used multiple analytical methods across the micro to bulk scale and density functional theory to provide quantitative information on As speciation in fly ash and clarify the roles of ash components on As retention. Fly ash samples derived from the high-As bituminous coal-fired power plants showed a chemical composition of typical Class F fly ash. In-situ electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was for the first time used to quantify and distinguish the inter-particle As distribution difference within coal fly ash. The spatial distribution of As was consistent with Fe, O, and sometimes with Ca. Grain-scale distribution of As in coal fly ash was quantified and As concentrations in single ash particles followed the order of Fe-oxides > aluminosilicates > unburned carbon > quartz. Sequential extraction and Wagner chemical plot of As confirmed that Fe minerals rather than Al-/Cabearing minerals played a vital role in capturing and oxidizing As3+ into solid phase (As5+). Magnetite content in fly ash well-correlated with the increase ratio of As before and after magnetic separation, suggesting magnetite enhanced As enrichment in fly ash. Density functional theory (DFT) indicated that the bridges O sites of octahedral structure on Fe3O4 (111) surface were likely strong active sites for As2O3 adsorption. This study highlights the importance of magnetite on As transformation during bituminous or high-rank coal combustion in power plants and has great implications for developing effective techniques for As removal.

Objective To investigate the detailed pharmacological activity for VEC clinical effects in GI diseases. Materials and methods Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: control, model, and drug-treated (VEC-L, VEC-M, VEC-H, and teprenone). Rats were orally administered VEC (124, 248, 496 mg/kg) and teprenone (21.43 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days. After 1 h, the five groups (except the control group) were orally given ethanol (10 mL/kg) for 1 h or indomethacin (80 mg/kg) for 7 h. The spasmolytic activity of VEC (0.01-1 mg/mL) on ACh/BaCl2-induced New Zealand rabbit smooth muscle contraction was performed. The C57BL/6 mice carbon propelling test evaluated the effects of VEC (248-992 mg/kg) on intestinal motility in normal and neostigmine/adrenaline-induced mice. Results Compared with the model group, VEC treatment reduced the gastric lesion index and mucosal damage. Further experiments showed that the pathological ameliorative effect of VEC was accompanied by augmentation of the enzymatic antioxidant system and cytoprotective marker (COX-1, p < 0.01; PGI2 p < 0.05;), along with the alleviation of the levels of MPO (ethanol: 15.56 +/- 0.82 vs. 12.15 +/- 2.60, p < 0.01; indomethacin: 9.65 +/- 3.06 vs. 6.36 +/- 2.43, p < 0.05), MDA (ethanol: 1.66 +/- 0.44 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.58, p < 0.01; indomethacin: 1.71 +/- 0.87 vs. 1.09 +/- 0.43, p < 0.05), and inflammatory mediators. VEC decreased the high tone induced by ACh/BaCl2 and promoted intestinal transit in normal and neostigmine/adrenaline-induced mice. Discussion and conclusions VEC showed a potential gastroprotective effect, suggesting that VEC is a promising phytomedicine for the treatment of GI diseases.

J	Li, S; Jena, P				Li, S.; Jena, P.			Li- and B-decorated cis-polyacetylene: A computational study	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; HYDROGEN STORAGE CAPACITY; ADSORPTION; SIMULATION	By using density functional theory and the generalized gradient approximation, we show that Li-decorated cis-polyacetylene meets some of the requirements of an ideal hydrogen storage material. Unlike Ti-doped cis-polyacetylene, Li resists clustering and can reversibly store up to 10.8 wt% hydrogen in molecular form. However, molecular dynamics simulations show that Li can retain hydrogen only at cryogenic temperatures. On the other hand, B-doped cis-polyacetylene can store up to 7.5 wt% hydrogen, but it binds to hydrogen too strongly to be suitable for room temperature applications. The results are compared to those in Ti-doped cis-polyacetylene.

However, only a few reports record the occurrence of PHCZs in farmland soils, and the sources of which were not yet been implemented. In this study, 12 PHCZs and carbazole (CZ) were screened in farmland soil samples from the Three Northeast Provinces, and the Sigma PHCZs were in the range of 18.16-219.67 ng/g dw. 36-CCZ was the dominant congener (40.67%) in farmland soils, followed by 3-CCZ (14.51%), and average percentages of other congeners were lower than 10%. A concrete analysis of the sources of PHCZs in the soil was conducted, revealing the diversity of PHCZs sources. Potential toxic effects associated with the levels of PHCZs were evaluated via the toxic equivalency (TEQ) approach, and the TEQs of PHCZs (TEQ(PHCZs)) were in the range of 224-14.06 pg TEQ/g dw. Notwithstanding the 1368-CCZ with a low concentration level, the mean contribution to TEQ(PHCZs) was up to 2424%, preceded only by 36-CCZ (39.69%), showing the congeners with low concentration also may pose potential risks to the environment. Partial PHCZs congeners (2-BCZ, 3-BCZ, 36-CCZ, 136-BCZ, and 2367-BCZ) showed significant correlations (r = 0.45-0.63,p <0.05) with the total organic carbon (TOC). Significant correlations were shown between PHCZ congeners replaced by halogens of the same species and quantity (r = 0.40-0.99, p < 0.01). In view of the fact that the high concentration level of PHCZs in the soil and their source diversity, more environmental monitoring and risk assessments of PHCZs should be of particular concern.

However, the effectiveness of these practices on soil properties and potato production in the relatively cool, moist maritime region of Canada has not yet been well studied. In the growing seasons of 2000-2003, a field experiment was conducted at the Potato Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Fredericton, New Brunswick, to assess the benefits of hay mulching on a loamy sand soil under potato production. Treatments consisted of four levels of hay mulching: 0, 2.25, 4.5, and 9.0 Mg ha(-1) with four replicates under irrigation or nonirrigation. Results showed that hay mulching could help conserve soil moisture in nonirrigation treatments with an increase of mean soil moisture content by 5.7 to 9.5% under 2.25 to 9.0 Mg ha(-1) of hay mulch relative to a control. The greatest conservation effect on soil water in our region would be achieved with a mulch rate of 5.6 Mg ha(-1). Under irrigation, mulching slightly increased soil temperature. Without irrigation, soil temperature was affected both positively and negatively by mulching, depending on time of day and quantity of mulch applied. During periods of warmer weather, mulching reduced maximum soil temperature during daytime but increased minimum soil temperature during nighttime. While the magnitude of soil temperature change was slight, it varied linearly with mulch quantity. During periods of cold weather, mulching generally increased soil temperature. The soil organic carbon content in the year following mulching increased proportionally with the amount of mulch applied in the nonirrigated treatments. Thus, thicker mulching treatments resulted in a greater increase in soil organic matter accumulation. Irrigation was found to potentially induce organic matter loss for the lower mulching treatment (2.25 Mg ha(-1)) and control. No significant effects of hay mulching on total potato tuber yield under irrigation were found, but tuber yield under nonirrigation increased linearly with the amount of mulch applied.

Based on mineralogy and petrology, rock types were recognized, with mudstones, siltstones, and limestones being the most common. Rock types, sedimentary structures, biota, and well log data were used to define and characterize 17 lithofacies and the following five facies associations of the fine-grained sediments: (1) delta front; (2) clastic lakeshore; (3) clastic shallow lake; (4) clastic semi-deep lake; and (5) carbonate lake. The content of total organic carbon ranges between 0.04% and 3.84%, with an average of 0.74%. The organic matter primarily consists of Type III kerogen. Major processes inferred from the lithofacies analyses include suspension, biogenic, and storm deposition. On the basis of facies associations, redox, climate and salinity conditions, biotic productivity, and terrigenous input, a total of six depositional environments are proposed: (I) high-productivity low-oxygen swamp (II) low-oxygen semi-deep lake (III) high-oxygen semi-deep lake (IV) high-oxygen shallow lake (V) deep-water low-oxygen semi-deep lake and (VI) high-salinity low-oxygen shallow lake. The nonmarine environments changed frequently, unlike more stable environments. The development of bivalves in the shallow lake is suggested to be related to high salinity caused by dry climate, together with limited terrigenous input. Organic-rich nonmarine fine-grained sediments in the Ziliujing Formation formed in swamp and semi-deep lake with settings under reducing conditions, in a humid climate, with relatively high terrigenous input. Results of the study may help us to understand the deposition of nonmarine organic-rich fine-grained Lower Jurassic sediments in southwest, China.

Objectives This study aimed to understand the crosstalk among redox status, energy metabolism, and inflammation in nutritional muscle dystrophy induced by dietary Se deficiency. Methods Eighteen castrated male pigs (Yorkshire, 45 d old) were fed Se-deficient (Se-D; 0.007 mg Se/kg) or Se-adequate (Se-A; in the form of selenomethionine, 0.3 mg Se/kg) diets for 16 wk. The muscle Se concentrations; antioxidant capacity; and gene expression, transcriptome, global proteome, metabolome, and lipidome profiles were analyzed. The transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome profiles were analyzed with biostatistics, bioinformatics, and pathway enrichment analysis; other data were analyzed with Student's 2-sided t tests. Results The muscle Se content in the Se-D group was 96% lower than that in the Se-A group (P < 0.05). The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD) in the Se-D group was 42%-69% lower than that in the Se-A group (P < 0.05). The mRNA levels of 10 selenoprotein genes were 25%-84% lower than those in the Se-A group (P < 0.05). Multi-omics analyses indicated that the levels of 1378 transcripts, 83 proteins, 22 metabolites, and 55 lipid molecules were significantly altered in response to Se deficiency. Se deficiency-induced redox imbalance led to muscle central carbon and lipid metabolism reprogramming, which enhanced the glycolysis pathway and decreased phospholipid synthesis. Inflammation and apoptosis were observed in response to Se deficiency-induced muscle oxidative stress, which may have been associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, suppressed focal adhesion and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling, and activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Conclusions These results contributed to understanding the crosstalk among redox, energy metabolism, and inflammation in Se deficiency-induced muscle dystrophy in pigs, and may provide intervention targets for muscle disease treatment.

The relative abundances of resolved (CH2D2)-C-12 and (CH3D)-C-13 and mechanisms controlling isotopic bond ordering in abiotic and biotic methane gases	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Methane isotopes; Isotope clumping	LOST-CITY; WITWATERSRAND BASIN; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; STABLE-ISOTOPE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; SOUTH-AFRICA; NATURAL-GAS; HEAT-FLOW; DEEP; HYDROGEN	We report measurements of resolved (CH2D2)-C-12 and (CH3D)-C-13 at natural abundances in a variety of methane gases produced naturally and in the laboratory. The ability to resolve (CH2D2)-C-12 from (CH3D)-C-13 provides unprecedented insights into the origin and evolution of CH4. The results identify conditions under which either isotopic bond order disequilibrium or equilibrium are expected. Where equilibrium obtains, concordant Delta (CH2D2)-C-12 and Delta (CH3D)-C-13 temperatures can be used reliably for thermometry. We find that concordant temperatures do not always match previous hypotheses based on indirect estimates of temperature of formation nor temperatures derived from CH4/H-2 D/H exchange, underscoring the importance of reliable thermometry based on the CH4 molecules themselves. Where Delta (CH2D2)-C-12 and Delta (CH3D)-C-13 values are inconsistent with thermodynamic equilibrium, temperatures of formation derived from these species are spurious. In such situations, while formation temperatures are unavailable, disequilibrium isotopologue ratios nonetheless provide novel information about the formation mechanism of the gas and the presence or absence of multiple sources or sinks. In particular, disequilibrium isotopologue ratios may provide the means for differentiating between methane produced by abiotic synthesis vs. biological processes. Deficits in (CH2D2)-C-12 compared with equilibrium values in CH4 gas made by surface-catalyzed abiotic reactions are so large as to point towards a quantum tunneling origin. Tunneling also accounts for the more moderate depletions in (CH3D)-C-13 that accompany the low (CH2D2)-C-12 abundances produced by abiotic reactions. The tunneling signature may prove to be an important tracer of abiotic methane formation, especially where it is preserved by dissolution of gas in cool hydrothermal systems (e.g., Mars). Isotopologue signatures of abiotic methane production can be erased by infiltration of microbial communities, and Delta (CH2D2)-C-12 values are a key tracer of microbial recycling.

Exploring the action mechanism of magnesium in different cations sites for LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode materials	MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Li-ion batteries; Single crystals; Micron-sized materials; Mg doping; High-temperature performances	LI-ION BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE; CYCLING STABILITY; RATE CAPABILITY; PERFORMANCE; AL; ELECTRODE; CO; LINI0.5CO0.2MN0.3O2	Micron-sized single-crystal LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO-900) cathodes suffer from poor rate capability and inferior specific capacity. Mg doping is regarded as an efficient strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of LNMO cathodes. In this work, the effect of replacing a small part of Ni or Mn with Mg are studied. Compared with LiNi0.47Mg0.03Mn1.5O4 (Mg-Ni-LNMO), the lattice parameter of LiNi0.5Mn1.47Mg0.03O4 (Mg-Mn-LNMO) is significantly increased, which provides a wider channel for the transmission of Li+. Besides, the Mg-Mn-LNMO has a higher Ni2+ and a lower Mn3+ content in the crystal lattice, which is beneficial to improve the energy density and cycling stability. Moreover, replacing Mn with Mg in LNMO effectively suppresses Jahn-Teller distortion and helps to alleviate the dissolution of transition metal elements, which improves the capacity retention, especially at high temperatures. Our research indicates that replacing a small part of Mn is more feasible to improve the cycle performance of LNMO cathodes. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, a compact and dense MgF2 coating was prepared by the combination of fluoride treatment and ultrasonic treatment. The ultrasonically treated MgF2 coating showed a compact and dense structure without pores at the frequency of 28 kHz. The chemical compositions of the coating were mainly composed of F and Mg elements. The corrosion potential of the ultrasonically treated Mg alloy shifted towards the noble direction in the electrochemical tests. The corrosion current density decreased due to the protectiveness of MgF2 coating without defects of pores or cracks. During immersion tests for 24 h, the ultrasonically treated Mg alloy exhibited the lowest H-2 evolution (0.32 mL/cm(2)) and pH value (7.3), which confirmed the enhanced anti-corrosion ability of MgF2 coating. Hence, the ultrasonically treated fluoride coating had great potentials for their use in anti-corrosion applications of Mg alloy.

Fe2O3 precursors initially reduce to Fe3O4 and then to metallic Fe (in H-2) or to a mixture of Fe2.5C and Fe3C (in CO). Zn, present as ZnFe2O4, increases the surface area of precipitated oxide precursors by inhibiting sintering during thermal treatment and during activation in H-2/CO reactant mixtures, leading to higher FTS rates than on ZnO-free precursors. ZnFe2O4 species do not reduce to active FTS structures; but lead instead to the loss of active components; as a result, maximum FTS rates are achieved at intermediate Zn/Fe atomic ratios. Cu increases the rate. of Fe2O3 reduction to Fe3O4 by providing H-2 dissociation sites. Potassium increases CO activation rates and increases the rate of carburization of Fe3O4. In this manner; Cu and K promote the nucleation of oxygen-deficient FeOx species involved as intermediate inorganic, structures in reduction and carburization of Fe2O3 and decrease the ultimate size of the Fe oxide and carbide structures formed during activation in synthesis gas. As a result, Cu and K increase FTS rates on catalysts formed from Fe-Zn oxide precursors. Cu increases CH4 and the paraffin content in FTS products, but the additional presence of K inhibits these effects. Potassium titrates residual acid and hydrogenation sites and increases the olefin content and molecular weight of FTS products. K increases the rate of secondary water-gas shift reactions, while Cu increases the relative rate of oxygen removal as CO2 instead of water after CO is dissociated in FTS elementary steps: Through these two different mechanisms, K and Cu both increase CO2 selectivities during FTS reactions on catalysts based. on Fe-Zn oxide precursors.

Polyethyleneimine (PEI) induces the aggregation of AuNPs which results in a color change from wine red (peak at 520 nm) to blue (peak at 610 nm). In parallel, the fluorescence of AuNCs (with excitation/emission maxima at 370/610 nm) is weakened. However, in the presence of Hep (which is strongly negatively charged), it will electrostatically bind to positively charged PEI and then will prevent aggregation. Hence, the color changes from blue (aggregated) to red (non-aggregated). In parallel, fluorescence remains unchanged. Hep can be quantified by using the nanoprobe in the range of 4-220 ng.L-1, with the detection limits as low as 1.6 (colorimetry) and 3.4 ng.mL(-1) (fluorometry). The assay was applied to the detection of Hep in (spiked) human serum with satisfactory results.

In this paper, we focus on the mineralogy, radiocarbon dating, and stable isotope systematics of carbonate in hackberry endocarps. Hackberry fruits and seeds are edible in fresh and stored forms, and they were consumed in large quantities in many Neolithic sites in the Near East, including the site of our study, Asikli Hoyuk in central Anatolia, an Aceramic Neolithic tell occupied from about 9.4 to > 10.3 BP (7.4 to >8.3 BCE). Detailed C-14 age control provided by archaeological charcoal permits a test of the fidelity in C-14 dating of hackberry endocarps. Modern endocarps and leaves yield fraction modern C-14 values of 1.050-1.066, consistent with levels present in the atmosphere when sampled in 2009. On the other hand, archaeological endocarps yield consistently younger ages than associated charcoal by ca. 130 C-14 years (ca. 220 calendar years) for samples about 10,000 years old. We speculate this is caused by the slight addition of calcite or recrystallization to calcite in the endocarp, as detected by scanning electron microscopy. Subtle addition or replacement of calcite by primary aragonite is not widely recognized in the C-14 community, even though similar effects are reported from other natural carbonates such as shell carbonate. This small (but consistent) level of contamination supports the usefulness of endocarps in dating where other materials like charcoal are lacking. Before dating, however, hackberries should be carefully screened for mineralogical preservation and context. We examined the carbon and oxygen isotopic systematics of the fossil endocarps to try to establish potential source areas for harvesting. Most of the hackberries are enriched in O-18 compared to local water sources, indicating that they were drawing on highly evaporated soil water, rather than the local (perched and regional) water table sampled in our study. Isotopic evidence therefore suggests that most but not all of the hackberries were harvested from nearby mesas well above the local streams and seeps fed by the water table.

The mosaic structure design to improve the anchoring strength of SiOx@C@Graphite anode	MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY			English	Article						SiOx@C@Graphite anodes; Bonding strength; High performance	SILICON ANODES; HIGH-CAPACITY; LITHIUM; NANOSPHERES; ELECTRODE	Silicon oxide (SiOx)-based anodes have aroused great interest as the most promising alternative anode in the practical application of high-performance lithium-ion batteries. However, the electrochemical performance is inhibited because of the large volume change, and the electrode structure deteriorates during the cycling process, which hinders their practical application. In this article, a novel fabrication method for the synthesis of high-performance SiOx@C@Graphite composites is presented. SiOx particles are anchored on the graphite surface by chemical vapor deposition and compression molding. This structure makes up the shortcomings of poor electrical conductivity and poor bonding strength between SiOx and graphite particles. It is beneficial to form a stable solid electrolyte interface and helps to maintain the structural integrity of electrode materials. As a result, the synthetic SiOx@C@Graphite anode shows a high reversible capacity (2698.8 mA h), excellent cycle stability (about 76.9% capacity retention for 500 cycles) and a superior rate ability. Our research hopes to provide a new idea for improving the bonding strength of the surface coating. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To address such key challenges, we propose a new principle of multi-product sequential separation and a new method of sequential separation-driven SMR for the first time. Target product species H-2 and CO2 are sequentially separated, so that their partial pressures are maintained close to their maxima at thermodynamic equilibrium to effectively drive methane conversion to full completion theoretically. The new principle enables a remarkable decrease in the SMR temperature and a dramatic reduction in energy penalties of separation in theory and practice. The effectiveness of the new principle and method is demonstrated by a proof-of-concept reactor with a Pd-Ag membrane and alternating nickel catalyst/hydrotalcite sorbent combinations. High-purity H-2 and CO2 are directly obtained with >99% conversion of methane and >99% yield and selectivity of H-2 and CO2 under mild conditions of 400 degrees C and 1 bar. Fast and stable production of H-2 and CO2 is demonstrated over 6000 cycles. The highly compact reactor and mild operating conditions further enable integration with a parabolic trough solar collector, by which mid-temperature solar thermochemical H-2 production and CO2 capture are achieved. The solar-to-H-2 efficiency is 3.4% with direct solar illumination. The efficiency can be enhanced to 46.5% or above with solar thermal energy storage and advances in mid-/low-temperature SMR catalysts and CO2 sorbents, and can be further enhanced to beyond 60% with low-energy-penalty separation technologies.

Nevertheless, ultra-short carrier lifetimes and poor stabilities impede the construction of robust metal-NC-based photosystems. Herein, positively charged poly(diallyl-dimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and tailor-made negatively charged l-glutathione (GSH)-capped Ag-x@GSH [Ag-9(SG)(6), Ag-16(SG)(9) and Ag-31(SG)(19)] NCs are used as building blocks and alternately deposited on a one-dimensional wide-band-gap metal oxide (MO) substrate using a facile and general layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly strategy to design a highly efficient spatially directional charge transport pathway in multilayered photoanodes. The electrons photoexcited from the periodically stacked Ag-x@GSH [Ag-9(SG)(6), Ag-16(SG)(9) and Ag-31(SG)(19)] NC layers concurrently and unidirectionally migrate to the MO substrate, while the ultrathin PDDA intermediate layer serves as an interfacial electron-withdrawing charge mediator to accelerate the transport of the carriers photoexcited over the neighboring Ag-x@GSH [Ag-9(SG)(6), Ag-16(SG)(9) and Ag-31(SG)(19)] NC layers. Benefiting from the charge transfer enhancement, these LbL-assembled multilayered MO/(PDDA/Ag-x NCs)(n) heterostructured photoanodes demonstrate significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance under visible light irradiation due to the generation of unidirectional and spatially separated tandem charge transfer channels, which remarkably reduces the charge recombination and prolongs the carrier lifetime of the metal NCs. Moreover, we ascertain that this conceptual multilayered nanoarchitecture design and tandem charge transport are universal.

Ferulic acid (FA) is a phenolic acid widely isolated from abundant plants and exhibits multiple biological activities including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation and enhancement of immune responses. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) functions as a critical energy sensor and is regulated through the phosphorylation of liver kinases like LKB1 or dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). However, the role of FA in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced chronic inflammation and liver fibrosis and AMPK activation has not been elucidated. Here we reported that FA ameliorated CCl4-induced inflammation and fibrotic liver damage in mice as indicated by reduced levels of serum liver function enzyme activities and decreased expression of genes and proteins associated with fibrogenesis. Additionally, FA inhibited hepatic oxidative stress, macrophage activation and HSC activation via AMPK phosphorylation in different liver cells. Mechanically, without the participation of LKB1, FA-induced anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects were abrogated by a specific AMPK inhibitor, compound C. Combining with the results of molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we further demonstrated that FA directly bound to and inhibited PTP1B, an enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating key protein kinases, and eventually leading to the phosphorylation of AMPK. In summary, our results indicated that FA alleviated oxidative stress, hepatic inflammation and fibrotic response in livers through PTP1B-AMPK signaling pathways. Taken together, we provide novel insights into the potential of FA as a natural product-derived therapeutic agent for the treatment of fibrotic liver injury.

However, its practical application was still hampered by the sluggish oxygen-evolution kinetics, the rapid recombination of photo-generated charge carriers and the relatively low conductive band level of WO3. Defect control is considered to be one of the promising strategies to improve the water oxidation performance of tungsten oxide photoanodes. In this work, an efficient, room temperature method was developed to enrich oxygen vacancies of WO3 nanoflakes through an Ar plasma treatment for 3 min. The rapid plasma treatment remarkably improved the efficiency of photo-electrochemical water oxidation, where a lower onset potential and higher photocurrent density of 1.20 mA/cm(2) at 1.4 V vs RHE were achieved, twice higher than the photocurrent density of pristine WO3 nanoflakes. The significant improvement was attributed to the enriched edge oxygen vacancies, which increases the donor density of WO3 nanoflakes, almost four times higher than that of the pristine ones, and enhances the electrical conductivity as well as charge transportation. The work represents a rapid, sustainable strategy to perform surface modification of WO3 nanoflakes for enriching the surface oxygen vacancies to improve the photoelectrochemical water splitting, which is very promising to be applied to different materials and a variety of fields.

Hydrogen-Atom Transfer in Reactions of Organic Radicals with [Co-II(por)](center dot) (por = Porphyrinato) and in Subsequent Addition of [Co(H)(por)] to Olefins	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL			English	Article						cobalt; density functional calculations; hydrogen transfer; olefin insertion; radicals	CATALYTIC CHAIN TRANSFER; CORRELATED AB-INITIO; GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; VINYL-ACETATE; STOICHIOMETRIC HYDROGENATION; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; METHYL-METHACRYLATE; HYDRIDOCOBALT TETRACARBONYL; ACTIVATION PARAMETERS; COPE REARRANGEMENT	The mechanisms for hydrogen-atom transfer from the cyanoisopropyl radical C-center dot(CH3)(2)CN to [Co-II(por)](center dot) (yielding [Co-III(H)(por)] and CH2=C(CH3)(CN); por = porphyrinato) and the insertion of vinyl acetate (CH2=CHOAc) into the Co-H bond of [Co(H)(por)] (giving [Co-III{CH-(OAc)CH3}(por)]) were investigated by DFT calculations. The results are compared with experimental data. These reactions are relevant to catalytic chain transfer (CCT) in radical polymerization of olefins mediated by [Co-II(por)](center dot), the formation and homolysis of organo-cobalt complexes that mediate living radical polymerization of vinyl acetate, and cobalt-mediated hydrogenation of olefins. Hydrogen transfer from C-center dot(CH3)(2)CN to [Co-II(por)](center dot) proceeds via a single transition state that has structural features resembling the products [Co(H)(por)] and CH2=C(CH3)CN. The separated radicals approach to form a close-contact radical pair and then pass through the transition state for hydrogen-atom transfer to form [Co-III(H)(por)] and CH2=C(CH3)CN. This process provides a very low overall barrier for the hydrogen-atom transfer reaction (Delta G((sic)) = + 3.8 kcal mol(-1)). The reverse reaction corresponding to the addition of [Co(H)(por)] to CH2=C(CH3)CN has a low barrier (Delta G((sic)) = + 8.9 kcal mol(-1)) as well. Insertion of vinyl acetate into the Co-H bond of [Co-III(H)(por)] also proceeds over a low barrier (Delta G((sic)) = + 11.4 kcal mol(-1)) hydrogen-transfer step from [Co-III(H)(por)] to a carbon atom of the alkene to produce a close-contact radical pair. Dissociation of the radical pair, reorientation, and radical-radical coupling to form an organo-cobalt complex are the culminating steps in the net insertion of an olefin into the Co-H bond. The computed energies obtained for the hydrogen-atom transfer reactions from C-center dot(CH3)(2)CN to [Co-II(por)](center dot) and from [Co(H)(por)] to olefins, as well as the organo-cobalt bond homolysis energies correspond well with the experimental observations. The mechanism of alkene insertion into the Co-H bond of [Co-III(H)(por)] is of general interest, because the species does not contain any cis-vacant sites to the hydride and the usual migratory insertion pathway is not available. The low barrier predicted here for the multistep insertion process suggests that (depending on the bond strengths) even for systems that do have a cis-vacant site, the radical-type insertion might compete with classical migratory insertion.

Compared with the simple doping of MXene into the polymer matrix, the 3D structure greatly reduces the amount of absorbing filler while improving the microwave absorbing performance of epoxy resin, which realizes the economical and efficient use of absorbing agents. The MX/CF/Epoxy composite has a RLmin of -41.46 dB when the content of MXene is only 0.337 wt% and CF is 1.183 wt% with a thickness of 1.83 mm. At the same time, the EVB of the composite can reach 4.67 GHz (10.58-15.25 GHz). The effective improvement on microwave absorbing performance of MX/CF/Epoxy composites is mainly due to the unique 3D foam structure, the interface polarization and dipole relaxation caused by surface functional groups and defects of MX/CF. This work provides new ideas for improving the application potential of epoxy resin-based composites in the field of microwave absorption.

Improved Stability and Catalytic Properties of Au-16 Cluster Supported on Graphane	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							BERRYS PHASE; HYDROGENATION; GRAPHENE; TRANSITION; NANOCLUSTERS	Using the density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation, we have examined the stability and the catalytic properties of Au-16 gold cage structure supported on graphane. The substantially improved stability is confirmed by the first-principles molecular dynamics simulation at the temperature above 500 K. The energy barrier is only 0.47 eV for the Langmuir-Hinshelwood Oxidation process for a CO coadsorbed on catalyst with an O-2 molecule. The following Eley-Rideal oxidation process can happen almost simultaneously for its low activation barrier of similar to 0.13 eV. A simple model to mimic the situation of the full coverage of CO on gold catalyst can experience oxidation by overcoming 0.63 eV energy barrier, which suggests the CO tolerant property of the complex graphane-based gold catalyst.

J	Pham, A; Gil, CJ; Smith, SC; Li, S				Pham, Anh; Gil, Carmen J.; Smith, Sean C.; Li, Sean			Orbital engineering of two-dimensional materials with hydrogenation: A realization of giant gap and strongly correlated topological insulators	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SPIN HALL INSULATOR; GRAPHENE; STATE	Orbital interaction plays an important role in topological insulators. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that hydrogenation can change two-dimensional (2D) trivial insulator/semimetal-like Pb, Mo, and W to a Z(2) topological insulator with giant gaps by filtering unwanted orbitals such as the p(z) orbital in Pb, and the d(3z2-r2) in Mo andW. For PbH, the large intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) confined in the in-plane orbitals p(x,y) results in a bulk gap of 1.07 eV. For the case of MoH andWH, hydrogenation results in a novel sd(4) hybridization with a Dirac cone formed by the out-of-plane orbital d(yz/xz) orbitals. Furthermore, due to the electron-electron interaction and the strong SOC in the 4d and 5d elements, the bulk band gap is significantly enhanced with a value of 1.28 eV for MoH and 0.30 eV for WH. The strong correlation effect also induces several topological phase transitions in WH like the Dirac semimetal and Mott insulating phase, while MoH remains a topological insulator even with large correlation effect. We propose that these new strongly correlated 2D materials can be realized experimentally by using substrate such as the boron nitride sheet, which can exhibit various novel properties such as the Dirac semimetal phase with large spin-orbit energy splitting as well as the quantum spin Hall property.

Air quality and climate change, Topic 3 of the Model Inter-Comparison Study for Asia Phase III (MICS-Asia III) - Part 2: aerosol radiative effects and aerosol feedbacks	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MARINE STRATOCUMULUS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; TIBETAN PLATEAU; BOUNDARY-LAYER; EASTERN CHINA; HAZE EVENT; METEOROLOGY; CHEMISTRY; CLOUD; POLLUTION	Topic 3 of the Model Inter-Comparison Study for Asia (MICS-Asia) Phase III examines how online coupled air quality models perform in simulating wintertime haze events in the North China Plain region and evaluates the importance of aerosol radiative feedbacks. This paper discusses the estimates of aerosol radiative forcing, aerosol feedbacks, and possible causes for the differences among the participating models. Over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, the ensemble mean of estimated aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) at the top of atmosphere, inside the atmo- sphere, and at the surface are - 1.1, 7.7, and -8.8 W m(-2) during January 2010, respectively. Subdivisions of direct and indirect aerosol radiative forcing confirm the dominant role of direct forcing. During severe haze days (17-19 January 2010), the averaged reduction in near-surface temperature for the BTH region can reach 0.3-1.6 degrees C. The responses of wind speeds at 10 m (WS10) inferred from different models show consistent declines in eastern China. For the BTH region, aerosol-radiation feedback-induced daytime changes in PM2.5 concentrations during severe haze days range from 6.0 to 12.9 mu g m(-3) (< 6 %). Sensitivity simulations indicate the important effect of aerosol mixing states on the estimates of ADRF and aerosol feedbacks. Besides, black carbon (BC) exhibits a large contribution to atmospheric heating and feedbacks although it accounts for a small share of mass concentration of PM2.5.

The structure of APP has been systemically characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and P-31 NMR). Subsequently, APP was added into bismaleimide (BMI) resin to prepare flame retardant materials, coded as P-DBMI resin. The effects of APP content on the mechanical properties of the P-DBMI resins have been studied.

Three different cases were designed to examine the effects of fuel and oxidizer feeding method, diluent property, oxygen content and equivalence ratio on the characteristics of hydrogen flame, including the flame structure, lean extinction limit, flame stability and temperature. The results show that by enhancing mixing rate through feeding system, the range of equivalence ratio for steady tubular flame can be much expanded for the N-2 diluted mixture, however, at the oxygen content of 0.21 (hydrogen/air) the steady tubular flame is achieved only up to equivalence ratio of 0.5; by decreasing oxygen content, the lean extinction limit slightly increases, and the upper limit for steady tubular flame establishment increases significantly, resulting in an expanded tubular flame range. For CO2 diluted mixture, the stoichiometric combustion has been achieved within oxygen content of 0.1 and 0.25, for which the burned gas temperature is uniformly distributed inside the flame front; as oxygen content is below 0.21, a steady tubular flame can be obtained from the lean to rich limits; and the lean extinction limit increases from 0.17 to 0.4 as oxygen content decreases from 0.21 to 0.1, resulting in a shrunk tubular flame range. Laminar burning velocity, temperature and Damkohler number are calculated to examine the differences between N-2 and CO2 diluted combustion as well as the requirement for hydrogen-fueled tubular flame establishment.

Herein, an amorphous hierarchically structured MnO2/acetylene black (a-MnO2/AB) composite is successfully fabricated via a redox method and subsequent mechanical ball milling. The a-MnO2/AB composite is composed of approximately 300 nm flower-like amorphous MnO2 submicron spheres and acetylene black particles with a diameter of about 50 nm. The a-MnO2/AB electrode exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of 73.2%, excellent rate capabilities of 318 mA h g(-1) at 9.6 A g(-1), and high specific capacity retention of 1300 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 A g(-1). The amorphous structure can provide more channels for rapid lithium-ion transmission due to the disorder and defects, and the ion-diffusion coefficient (similar to 5 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1)) is higher than those of crystalline materials. Due to the strong interactions (Mn-O-C bonds) between MnO2 and AB as a result of the ball milling, the composite shows low charge transport resistance and small volume changes during the discharging/charging process. This work provides a facile route for the construction of amorphous hierarchically structured Mn-based oxides as anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

The structural characterizations disclosed a complex interface configuration made of nc-graphite, nc-Ni (pre-deposited on Si-NPA as catalyst for nc-graphite growth), nc-NiO2, and nc-Si. The designed nano-graphite/SiNPA exhibits strong light absorption and sensitive photoresponsivity under low-bias potential in the visible region of 400-800 nm. For example, it shows a switching ratio of 75, a photoresponsivity of similar to 0.16 AW(-1) and a rise/fall time of 12.24/5.66 s with an ultralow bias of 0.1 mV under the visible illumination of 5 mWcm(-2). The high switching ratio and responsivity were ascribed to the complexity of the interface nanostructures and the formation of a thick and compact graphite nanofilm. The results illustrate that nano-graphite/Si-NPA might be a promising candidate material for fabricating high-performance low-power Si-based visible photodetectors.

To date, it is still a challenge to achieve a high efficiency based on direct Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall water splitting, because suitable band gaps and overpotentials for both half-reactions and spatially separated catalytic sites should be fulfilled simultaneously in a photocatalytic system. These challenges can be solved by taking advantage of the intrinsic dipole effect for polarized materials. Here, we propose a new strategy to achieve this goal by constructing van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on two-dimensional (2D) polarized materials. Using density functional theory calculations, we predict a promising photocatalyst In2Se3/SnP3 heterostructure, with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) taking place separately on the SnP3 and In2Se3 layers. It is found that the intrinsic dipole of the In2Se3 monolayer effectively enhances the redox abilities for both the HER and OER. Moreover, the intrinsic dipole can promote the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, and also contributes to a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 19.26%, which is quite promising for commercial applications. This work opens up an avenue for the design of highly efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts for overall water splitting.

Improvements in detector technology and focusing X-ray optics now enable sensitive astrophysical X-ray polarization measurements. These measurements will provide new insights into the processes at work in accreting black holes, the emission of X-rays from neutron stars and magnetars, and the structure of AGN jets. X-Calibur is a balloon-borne hard X-ray scattering polarimeter. An X-ray mirror with a focal length of 8 m focuses X-rays onto the detector, which consists of a plastic scattering element surrounded by Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride detectors, which absorb and record the scattered X-rays. Since X-rays preferentially scatter perpendicular to their polarization direction, the polarization properties of an X-ray beam can be inferred from the azimuthal distribution of scattered X-rays. A close alignment of the X-ray focal spot with the center of the detector is required in order to reduce systematic uncertainties and to maintain a high photon detection efficiency. This places stringent requirements on the mechanical and thermal stability of the telescope structure. During the flight on a stratospheric balloon, X-Calibur makes use of the Wallops Arc-Second Pointer (WASP) to point the telescope at astrophysical sources. In this paper, we describe the design, construction, and test of the telescope structure, as well as its performance during a 25-h flight from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico. The carbon fiber-aluminum composite structure met the requirements set by X-Calibur and its design can easily be adapted for other types of experiments, such as X-ray imaging or spectroscopic telescopes.

Two different metallic structures, the split ring (type I structure) and the split ring inside a ring (type II structure), were prepared and voltage was applied through a forked finger electrode. The structures were wrapped in a thin film made by mixing strontium titanate nanopowder with polyimide in a certain ratio. Under normal incidence, the transmittance is controlled by applying a voltage to adjust the imaginary part of the permittivity of strontium titanate. The modulation depth of the type I structure at 1.08 THz is 40.1%, and that of the type II structure at 1.16 THz is 44.7%. The working bandwidths of the two structures are 0.07 THz and 0.42 THz, respectively, and are greatly broadened by combining with the ring. The proposed design enriches the modulation method of the transmission of metamaterials and broadens the application range of flexible terahertz metasurfaces.

Titanium carbide (MXene) is an emerging 2D nanomaterial with antimicrobial ability to physically damage bacterial membrane and chemically induce oxidative stress, and it can be further conjugated with nanomaterials to improve its antibacterial performance. Herein, a synergistic antimicrobial agent is developed through conjugation of the ultra-small gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) on MXene nanosheets. The conjugated AuNCs are effectively delivered into bacteria after bacterial membrane damage caused by MXene, generating localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) of high concentration to effectively oxidize bacterial membrane lipid for enhanced membrane broken, as well as bacterial DNA for violent fragmentation. Thus, the synergistic physical (via MXene) and chemical (via MXene and AuNCs) antimicrobial mechanisms lead to eventual bacterial death of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with low IC(50)values of 11.7 mu g mL(-1)of MXene and 0.04 mu mof AuNCs. Moreover, the crumpled MXene-AuNCs structure is constructed to inhibit biofilm formation, which hold synergistic antibacterial ability of MXene-AuNCs conjugation, hydrophobic surface to prevent bacterial attachment, and large surface area containing higher density of bactericides.

J	Younis, A; Chu, D; Li, S				Younis, Adnan; Chu, Dewei; Li, Sean			Ethanol-directed morphological evolution of hierarchical CeOX architectures as advanced electrochemical capacitors	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ENERGY-STORAGE; OXIDE; SUPERCAPACITORS; ELECTRODES; NANOCOMPOSITES; NANOPARTICLES; GRAPHENE; INNER	To surmount the fundamental limits of energy density in the current supercapacitor devices, the electrode materials should be capable of storing localized charge while having a high degree of freedom to provide ease of electron/ion flow in/out of the electrodes. Herein, we demonstrated a facile approach to designing CeOx based hierarchical architectures for high-performance energy storage electrodes. The unique CeOx based hierarchical architectures, including nanowires, nanocables, nano-micro biscuits and micro walls, were fabricated by simply manipulating the nitrate ion oxidation rate during electrochemical synthesis. Among all the electrodes, the CeOx nano-micro biscuits demonstrated the most excellent electrochemical performance from undergoing fast faradaic reactions leading to high specific capacitance within short charging time. Furthermore, voltammetric sweep mediated analysis was utilized to quantify the capacitive and intercalation effects in the total stored charge capacity of CeOx nano-micro biscuits. The presence of higher Ce3+ content (as confirmed by XPS studies) in CeOx nano-micro biscuits could be responsible for accelerating faradaic redox reactions (conversion of Ce3+ to Ce4+) in electrolyte solution, which is sufficient for realizing their superior performance over the other nano-microstructures. The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of CeOx as a low-cost and promising candidate for future energy storage/harvesting and integrated nanoelectronic devices.

However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the synthesis of SiNPs via microwave-assisted methods under normal pressure. Here we developed a new, facile, one-pot microwave-assisted method for the synthesis SiNPs (similar to 4.2 nm) with excellent water solubility under normal pressure by employing glycerol as the solvent. Furthermore, glycerol might be responsible for the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) value up to 47% for the resultant SiNPs. The use of organic solvent could afford less nanoparticle surface defects compared with those prepared in aqueous solution, thus improving the fluorescent efficiency. The as-prepared SiNPs simultaneously featured bright blue-green fluorescence, long lifetime (similar to 12.8 ns), obvious up-conversion luminescence originating from two photon absorption, superbly strong photostability, and favorable low toxicity. As a satisfactory probe, the as-synthesized SiNPs were successfully applied in fluorescence imaging of human cervical carcinoma cell lines (HeLa) and zebrafish.

Therefore, their adsorption to various materials has drawn great interests. However, the adsorption mechanisms of IBP and NAP at a molecular level were not well-known. This study investigated the adsorption of IBP and NAP by two types of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2, and the adsorption mechanisms were revealed at macro and micro molecule levels based on experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Greater adsorption of IBP onto MOFs was observed compared with NAP, which is incurred by its higher binding energies with adsorbents than NAP as revealed by DFT calculations. Four mechanisms, including pi-pi EDA interaction, Lewis acid/base complexing (LAB), hydrogen bonding, and anion-p interaction, were simultaneously involved in the adsorption of IBP/NAP by MOFs. The binding energies followed the order of pi-pi > hydrogen bonding > LAB > anion-p. The decreasing adsorption of IBP and NAP with rising pH was induced by the facilitated aggregation of MOFs at pH < pHpzc and the electrostatic repulsion between IBP/NAP and MOFs at pH > pHpzc. Direct competition for adsorption sites accounted for the competitive adsorption between IBP and NAP, and the extra type of binding site (amino group) and less amount of adsorption sites induced the less competition between IBP and NAP onto UiO-66-NH2 compared with UiO-66. This study, at a molecular level, provides adsorption mechanisms of acidic pharmaceuticals with MOFs.

In the present study, Neutral Polysaccharide (NPPN) were further purified from crude polysaccharide isolated from panax notoginseng. The effects of NPPN on the immune function and hematopoietic function of mice with low immunity and myelosuppression induced by cyclophosphamide (CTX) were investigated. The effect of NPPN combined with CTX on the tumor inhibition rate of the H22 tumor-bearing mice and the impact of NPPN on the proliferation of H22 liver cancer cells in vitro were investigated.MethodsCPPN was obtained by water extraction and alcohol precipitation method, and further purified by DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange resin column. NPPN was added to the immunosuppressed with myelosuppression mice induced by CTX. Thymus index, spleen index, lymphocyte proliferation stimulation index by adding of concanavalin A, determination of serum hemolysin, NK cell activity assay, mice carbon clearance experiment, blood count tests were detected. The tumor inhibition rate of the H22 tumor-bearing mice treated with NPPN combined with CTX was recorded.ResultsNPPN and 4 kinds of acid polysaccharide from Panax notoginseng (APPN) were successfully isolated from the CPPN by DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange resin column. NPPN inhibited the growth of H22 cells and significantly increase the tumor inhibition rate of the H22 tumor-bearing mice combined with CTX. The elevation of the cellular and humoral immunity levels as well as a variety of blood count tests indicators of immunosuppressive with myelosuppression mice may contribute to the antitumor activity of NPPN.ConclusionNPPN has a potential antitumor activity for the treatment of liver cancer combined with cyclophosphamide.

High-performance top-gated monolayer SnS2 field-effect transistors and their integrated logic circuits	NANOSCALE			English	Article							GRAPHENE; MOS2; LAYERS; GAS	Two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors are very promising for post-silicon ultrathin channels and flexible electronics due to the remarkable dimensional and mechanical properties. Besides molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), the first recognized 2D semiconductor, it is also important to explore the wide spectrum of layered metal chalcogenides (LMCs) and to identify possible compounds with high performance. Here we report the fabrication of high-performance top-gated field-effect transistors (FETs) and related logic gates from monolayer tin disulfide (SnS2), a non-transition metal dichalcogenide. The measured carrier mobility of our monolayer devices reaches 50 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), much higher than that of the back-gated counterparts (similar to 1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). Based on a direct-coupled FET logic technique, advanced Boolean logic gates and operations are also implemented, with a voltage gain of 3.5 and output swing of >90% for the NOT and NOR gates, respectively. The superior electrical and integration properties make monolayer SnS2 a strong candidate for next-generation atomic electronics.	[Song, H. S.; Gao, L.; Tang, J.; Cheng, Y.

In this paper, we evaluate the techno-economic performance of a SNG and power cogeneration technology with CO2 capture. Current localization level (the cost difference of a technology in different nations and districts) of each subunit of this technology is analyzed. The cost reduction potential of this technology is also predicted, and the role of technology localization and efficiency upgrade in cost reduction is investigated based on a range of learning rates and different coal prices from 90$/t to 150$/t. Results show that the unit investment of this cogeneration technology presented in our previous paper is around 1700$/kW currently and the investment of SNG synthesis, coal gasification and combined cycle unit comprises over 60% of the total investment. The equivalent SNG production cost is quite sensitive to coal prices and ranges from 0.15 to 0.50$/Nm(3). Through localization, the unit investment of this technology can be decreased by 30% currently. The key technologies including coal gasification, SNG synthesis and high performance gas turbine need further localization because of their relatively low current localization levels and big localization potential. Through cost learning, the future investment of the technology can be decreased to 700-1100$/kW, which may be competitive with the unit investment of IGCC technology with CO2 capture and even may be lower than that of the pulverized coal power plant with CO2 capture. Technology localization and efficiency upgrade will play important roles in cost reduction, which can contribute 300-500$/kW and 125-225$/kW to cost reduction, respectively. The results presented in this paper indicate that the coal to SNG and power technology with CO2 capture is a promising and competitive option for energy saving and CO2 abatement, and can be a support for policy making, technology options etc. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The main challenge lies in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which when formed naturally (nSEI), is fragile and cannot tolerate the large volume changes of Si during lithiation/delithiation. An artificial SEI (aSEI) with a specific set of mechanical characteristics is henceforth designed; we enclose Si within a TiO2 shell thinner than 15 nm, which may or may not be completely hermetic at the beginning. In situ TEM experiments show that the TiO2 shell exhibits 5 x greater strength than an amorphous carbon shell. Void-padded compartmentalization of Si can survive the huge volume changes and electrolyte ingression, with a self-healing aSEI + nSEI. The half-cell capacity exceeds 990 mA h g (-1) after 1500 cycles. To improve the volumetric capacity, we further compress SiMA 3-fold from its tap density (0.4 g cm(-3)) to 1.4 g cm(-3), and then run the full-cell battery tests against a 3 mA h cm(-2) LiCoO2 cathode. Despite some TiO2 enclosures being inevitably broken, 2x the volumetric capacity (1100 mA h cm (-3)) and 2x the gravimetric capacity (762 mA h g(-1)) of commercial graphite anode is achieved in stable full-cell battery cycling, with a stabilized areal capacity of 1.6 mA h cm(-2) at the 100th cycle. The initial lithium loss, characterized by the coulombic inefficiency (CI), is carefully tallied on a logarithmic scale and compared with the actual full-cell capacity loss. It is shown that a strong, non-adherent aSEI, even if partially cracked, facilitates an adaptive self-repair mechanism that enables full-cell cycling of a SiMA, leading to a stabilized coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.9%.

To address this critical issue, we herein demonstrate a facile and general method, i.e., solvent polarity-induced photoluminescence enhancement (SPIPE), yielding several-fold increase in quantum yield (QY) of SiNPs. Typically, different kinds of 4-substituented-1,8-naphthalic anhydride molecules, i.e., 4-Br-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (BNA), 4-triphenylamino-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (TPNA), and 4-dimethylamino-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (DMNA), are rationally designed and synthesized, which serve as surface ligands for the production of BNA-, TPNA-, and DMNA-capped small-sized (diameter: similar to 3.8-5.8 nm) SiNPs with QY of similar to 8%, similar to 15%, similar to 16%, respectively. Of particular significance, QY of the resultant SiNPs could be greatly enhanced from similar to 10% to similar to 50% through the SPIPE strategy. Taken together with the theoretical calculation and the results of time-correlated single photon counting, we reveal that actived excited-state charge transfer interactions between surface-covered ligand and silicon oxide coating would be responsible for the observed QY enhancement. Moreover, other five kinds of solvents (i.e., methanol, isopropanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, and acetonitrile) are further employed for the SiNPs treatment, and similar improvement of QY values are observed, convincingly demonstrating the universal evidence of SPIPE of the SiNPs.

Highly anisotropic two-dimensional metal in monolayer MoOCl2	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							INTERATOMIC FORCE-CONSTANTS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; NEGATIVE REFRACTION; INDEFINITE; GRAPHENE	Anisotropy is a general feature in materials. Strong anisotropy could lead to interesting physical properties and useful applications. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we predict a stable two-dimensional (2D) material-the monolayer MoOCl2-and show that it possesses intriguing properties related to its high anisotropy. Monolayer MoOCl2 can be readily exfoliated from the van der Waals layered bulk, which has already been synthesized. We show that a high in-plane anisotropy manifests in the structural, phononic, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of monolayer MoOCl2. The material is a metal with highly anisotropic Fermi surfaces, giving rise to open orbits at the Fermi level, which can be probed in magnetotransport. Remarkably, the combination of high anisotropy and metallic character makes monolayer MoOCl2 an almost ideal hyperbolic material. It has two very wide hyperbolic frequency windows from 0.41 eV (99 THz) to 2.90 eV (701 THz), and from 3.63 eV (878 THz) to 5.54 eV (1340 THz). The former window has a large overlap with the visible spectrum, and the dissipation for most of this window is very small. The window can be further tuned by the applied strain, such as that at a chosen frequency, a transition between elliptic and hyperbolic character can be induced by strain. Our work discovers a highly anisotropic 2D metal with extraordinary properties, which holds great potential for electronic and optical applications.

The effect of potassium on photosynthetic acclimation in cucumber during CO2 enrichment	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						CO2 enrichment; cucumber; final product negative feedback; photosynthetic acclimation; potassium	CARBON-DIOXIDE; ELEVATED CO2; GROWTH	Long-term CO2 enrichment (1,000 mu mol mol(-1)) leads to photosynthetic acclimation in cucumber. Here, through hydroponic experiments in an open-top climate chamber system, we investigated key photosynthetic parameters of cucumbers using potassium stimulation (120 or 240 mg L-1). Short-term CO2 enrichment (less than 25 days) significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate in cucumber. However, long-term CO2 enrichment (43 d) led to photosynthetic acclimation and decrease in stomatal conductance. The increase in potassium alleviated the decrease in photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, which reduced photosynthetic acclimation. In addition, C-13 isotope tracing showed that under CO2 enrichment, plants with higher potassium concentrations showed higher sink/source and flow/source ratios of photosynthetic assimilative C (delta C-13) abundance. Moreover, the abnormal accumulation of soluble carbohydrates and starch resulted in photosynthetic acclimation in cucumber. Increasing potassium significantly reduced the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates and promoted the transport of soluble carbohydrates to the sink, which alleviated photosynthetic acclimation.

To overcome the problems mentioned above, a novel DEFC system with a polymer fiber membrane (PFM) and nonplatinum catalysts is proposed. In this system, the performance of the anode catalyst Pd/C is significantly promoted by homogeneous Ni-doped SnO(2)nanoparticles, and the inexpensive permeable PFM is used as a substitute for the PEM. Due to the remarkable catalytic activity and the optimized resistance, the PFM-based DEFC exhibits encouraging performance, which can afford a peak power density of 47.4 mW cm(-2)with a porous NiCo(2)O(4)cathode catalyst. Moreover, it can operate continuously for 100 h with only 4.56% drop in electrical output. Therefore, this study provides a very effective strategy for optimizing DEFCs with low cost and high performance.

Examples of such studies include exploring their low-energy analogs in a condensed-matter system, where they arise as collective states or quasiparticles. Here we show that a toolbox for systematically engineering the emergent elementary fermions, i.e., Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana fermions, can be built in a single atomic system composed of a spinless magnetic dipolar Fermi gas in a three-dimensional optical lattice. The designed direction-dependent dipole-dipole interaction leads to both the basic building block, i.e., in-plane p + ip superfluid pairing instability, and the manipulating tool, i.e., out-of-plane Peierls instability. It is shown that the Peierls instability provides a natural way of tuning the topological nature of p + ip superfluids and can transform the fermion's nature between distinct emergent particles. Our scheme should contribute to the search for elementary particles through manipulating the topology.

J	Hu, H; Li, J; Cheng, GH; Li, S				Hu, H; Li, J; Cheng, GH; Li, S			Catalytic reduction of SO2 on CeO2-La2O3 rare earth mixed compounds	JOURNAL OF RARE EARTHS			English	Article						catalytic chemistry; CeO2-La2O3; solid phase complex; catalytic reduction; desulfurization; rare earths	SULFUR-DIOXIDE; CARBON-MONOXIDE; CO; OXIDE; LA2O3	Adding rare earth oxide CeO2 with variable valences to La2O3 formed a mixture of rare earth oxides. By means of dipping CeO2, La2O3 and their mixture, whose carriers were all gamma-Al2O3, were used as the catalyst for the reduction of SO2 by CO. The activation process of this catalyst and the impact of temperature and reactant concentration on the activation process were investigated. Using X-ray diffraction, the structure characteristics of catalyst before and after reaction were analyzed to reveal the change of phase structure. The result shows that the rare earth oxide mixtures composing of CeO2 and La2O3, as the catalyst for the reduction of SO2 by CO, diminish activation temperature 50 similar to 100 degreesC less and have higher activity than a single oxide CeO2 or La2O3. The reason possible is that La2O3 goes into in the lattice of CeO2 to form solid phase complex CeO2-La2O3 and increases the capability of CeO2-La2O3/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst to store oxygen, which supplies the redox of CeO2 reaction with a better condition. At the same time, elemental sulfur formed in the redox reaction impels La2O3 to be transformed to activation phase La2O2S in a lower temperature, which can be explained with the synergism between redox reaction and COS intermediate mechanism reaction.

Therefore, revealing the mechanisms associated with community assembly and co-occurrence network structure of microbes along plant species diversity gradients is very important for understanding biodiversity maintenance and community stability in response to plant diversity loss. Increasing biodiversity loss profoundly affects community structure and ecosystem functioning. However, the differences in community assembly and potential drivers of the co-occurrence network structure of soil fungi and bacteria in association with tree species richness gradients are poorly documented. Here, we examined soil fungal and bacterial communities in a Chinese subtropical tree species richness experiment (from 1 to 16 species) using amplicon sequencing targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 and V4 hypervariable region of the rRNA genes, respectively. Tree species richness had no significant effect on the diversity of either fungi or bacteria. In addition to soil and spatial distance, tree species richness and composition had a significant effect on fungal community composition but not on bacterial community composition. In fungal rather than bacterial co-occurrence networks, the average degree, degree centralization, and clustering coefficient significantly decreased, but the modularity significantly increased with increasing tree species richness. Fungal co-occurrence network structure was influenced by tree species richness and community composition as well as the soil carbon: nitrogen ratio, but the bacterial co-occurrence network structure was affected by soil pH and spatial distance. This study demonstrates that the community assembly and potential drivers of the co-occurrence network structure of soil fungi and bacteria differ in the subtropical forest. IMPORTANCE Increasing biodiversity loss profoundly affects community structure and ecosystem functioning. Therefore, revealing the mechanisms associated with community assembly and co-occurrence network structure of microbes along plant species diversity gradients is very important for understanding biodiversity maintenance and community stability in response to plant diversity loss. Here, we compared the differences in community assembly and potential drivers of the co-occurrence network structure of soil fungi and bacteria in a subtropical tree diversity experiment. In addition to soil and spatial distance, plants are more strongly predictive of the community and co-occurrence network structure of fungi than those of bacteria. The study highlighted that plants play more important roles in shaping community assembly and interactions of fungi than of bacteria in the subtropical tree diversity experiment.

The mechanisms associated with changes in alpine plant traits, and functional diversity under different grazing regimes have not been deeply explored. We examined the variations of plant leaf traits and functional diversity of an alpine meadow under different grazing regimes in a 3-year experiment. The results showed, after 3 years of yak grazing, that the coverage of Stipa capillata increased, whereas that of Kobresia pygmaea decreased under grazing exclosure. Stipa capillata had a lower ratio of leaf nitrogen content to phosphorus content (N : P) under grazing exclosure than under rotational grazing and continuous grazing, whereas Kobresia pygmaea showed no significant differences among grazing treatments. Among grazing regimes, the specific leaf area (SLA) of Stipa capillata was similar, whereas that of Kobresia pygmaea was higher under grazing exclosure. At the interspecific level, leaf area and weight were negatively correlated with SLA, whereas leaf carbon (C) content, leaf N content, leaf C : P and leaf N: P were negatively related to leaf P content and leaf C : N. These findings indicated that growth-defence trade-off strategies might lead to variations in plant traits and coverage. Large-leaved species, due to high maintenance costs, were less commonly distributed in the community, and they were better defended and unpalatable to yaks due to lower SLA, this formed the species coverage distribution pattern of the community. Various N and P utilisation efficiency of different species indicated diverse economic resources utilisation strategies might be due to niche differentiation in the community. Plots that had been excluded from grazing had the lowest functional richness, evenness, and divergence. Rotational and continuous grazing were equivalent in promoting alpine plant functional diversity.

Herein, a series of hydrophobic FeMnOx@SiO2-y-(CH3)(3) (y represents SiO2 weight percent of the catalyst) catalysts with various SiO2 shell content were synthesized for Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO). During the activation process, high hydrophobic SiO2-coating content catalysts suppressed the reduction/carburization of iron species to iron carbide. During FTO reaction, iron carbide of low hydrophobic SiO2-coating content catalysts was re-oxidized while it was stabilized for high hydrophobic SiO2-coating content catalysts. The trade-off among CO2, CH4 selectivity and SiO2-coating content was reflected as an increasing trend relationship, while olefins selectivity exhibited a decreasing trend. Additionally, a desirable hydrophobic SiO2-coating (8.2 wt %) catalyst apparently suppressed CO2 formation (4.7 C%) with high olefins selectivity (54.6 C%) at CO conversion of 50.7%. This study provides an efficient approach to inhibit CO2 formation of Fe-based FTO catalyst.

In this work, the effects of different orifice plate geometric parameters such as orifice shape (circle, square and triangle), orifice plate thickness (2.00-6.00 mm), orifice number (n = 1-5) and orifice divergence angle (alpha = 0 degrees and + 45 degrees) on the norfloxacin degradation by using HC were studied to obtain a strong HC effect. And the effects of various operating parameters such as solution pH (3.0-9.0) and initial norfloxacin concentrations (5.0-15 mg/L) on the norfloxacin degradation by using HC were discussed. The trapping experiments of free radicals COH and 'OD were also carried out for exploring the mechanism of norfloxacin degradation. In addition, adopting the designed orifice plates with optimized geometric parameters, the norfloxacin degradation efficiencies by using HC combined with some added oxidants (H2O2, K2S2O8 and NaClO) were investigated. The Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analysis at the optimum conditions was also performed to identify the mineralization extent. The intermediate products during the norfloxacin degradation were detected by using Liquid Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS). The experimental results indicated that, under 5.0 bar inlet pressure for 10 mg/L initial norfloxacin concentration at 40 degrees C operating temperature in pH = 3.0 solution, the degradation ratio of norfloxacin can reach up to 84.20% in the HC system and can reach up to 96.45% in the HC H2O2 system by using the orifice plate with 4.00 mm thickness, three square orifices and a = CD orifice divergence angle. The TOC test results show that the mineralization ratio can reach 71.57% in the HC system for 150 min successive cycling, which demonstrated that the HC can effectively mineralize norfloxacin. In addition, the LC-MS results manifested that norfloxacin moleculars can be degraded into a series of organic compounds with low molecular weight and further be oxidized into CO2, H2O and some inorganic ions during the HC process. Overall, the work has demonstrated that the HC is an effective strategy for a large-scale treatment of antibiotics wastewater.

Herein, we proposed a turn-on ratiometric fluorescent DA assay strategy by integrating a specific DA-resorcinol chemical reaction with a multifunctional lanthanide metal-organic framework (Ln-MOF). First, Eu-BTC (1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid) was synthesized and further modified to obtain Cu@Eu-BTC, which simultaneously plays multiple roles such as fluorescence internal standard, nanoreactor, cooperative catalysis effect and color shift enhancement. The Cu@Eu-BTC dispersion-based method exhibits ultra-sensitive (limit of detection, LOD is 0.01 mu M) and wide-range linear response (0.04-30 mu M) to DA in real serum. More importantly, it has excellent selectivity for DA, even in the presence of epinephrine and norepinephrine analogs. Thus, this method realizes the accurate and precise quantification of DA in serum (recoveries: 98.1%-110.1%, relative standard deviation RSD < 4.6%). Next, Cu@Eu-BTC was prepared into paper microchip, which has good storage stability (RSD < 3.5%, n = 3) in four weeks and achieves point-of-care visual DA assay coupled with smartphone-assisted portable detection device. The MOF paper microchip-based method shows low sample consumption (30 mu L), high accuracy and precision for the quantification of DA in serum (recovery of 92.9%-106.2%, RSD < 5.3%), and gets the same assay results as the MOF dispersion-based method (relative error <= 6.83%). To our knowledge, this is the first time to propose the catalytic fluorescence turn-on detection strategy of DA based on a MOF paper microchip.

However, the lack of high-performance SACs as well as the fundamental understanding of their unique catalytic mechanisms call for serious advances in this field. Herein, for the first time, we develop an Ir-N-C single-atom catalyst (Ir-SAC) which mimics homogeneous iridium porphyrins for high-efficiency ORR catalysis. In accordance with theoretical predictions, the as-developed Ir-SAC exhibits orders of magnitude higher ORR activity than iridium nanoparticles with a record-high turnover frequency (TOF) of 24.3e(-) site(-1)s(-1) at 0.85V vs. RHE) and an impressive mass activity of 12.2Amg(Ir)(-1), which far outperforms the previously reported SACs and commercial Pt/C. Atomic structural characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high activity of Ir-SAC is attributed to the moderate adsorption energy of reaction intermediates on the mononuclear iridium ion coordinated with four nitrogen atom sites.

To address this challenge, we built a new type of artificial photoenzymatic system for CO2 reduction, using a rationally designed mesoporous olefin-linked covalent organic framework (COF) as the porous solid carrier for co-immobilizing formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and Rh-based electron mediator. By adjusting the incorporating content of the Rh electronic mediator, which facilitates the regeneration of nicotinamide cofactor (NADH) from NAD(+), the apparent quantum yield can reach as high as 9.17 +/- 0.44 %, surpassing all reported NADH-regenerated photocatalysts constructed by crystalline framework materials. Finally, the assembled photocatalyst-enzyme coupled system can selectively convert CO2 to formic acid with high efficiency and good reusability. This work demonstrates the first example using COFs to immobilize enzymes for artificial photosynthesis systems that utilize solar energy to produce value-added chemicals.

However, the growth phenology (seasonal growth pattern) and responses of tree growth to climatic variables vary considerably among different species, especially between deciduous and evergreen species. Thus, it is crucial to explore the seasonal growth patterns of different tree species in relation to climate to better understand the responses of tree physiology to climate changes, especially in mixed-species forest stands. In this study, we monitored the daily basal area increments of 220 individuals belonging to 15 common broadleaved tree species, nine deciduous and six evergreen species, in mixed-species experimental stands in subtropical China and analysed the relationships between radial stem growth and seasonal climate at a high-temporal resolution. We fitted daily increments of stem diameters with four frequently used nonlinear models and chose the best model for each species. The results showed that the evergreen trees grew faster than the deciduous trees, both annually and within the growing season. The tested nonlinear models (Korf, Weibull, logistic and Gompertz) produced good fits for the growth patterns of all species. Overall, the evergreen species began stem growth earlier and finished later during the growing season than that of the deciduous species. Within the growing season, the radial growth of trees in mixed stands containing both types of species was strongly positively correlated with humidity. In spring, increases in both temperature and moisture increased the daily relative basal area increment of all species. Maximum growth rates occurred when the soil water content reached its highest level and gradually decreased when the soil water content decreased. In summer, high temperatures combined with low amounts of precipitation led to heat-induced summer drought, to which the evergreen trees appeared to be more tolerant than the deciduous trees, which was reflected in the reduced stem growth of the latter. These results indicate the different climate-dependent seasonal growth strategies of evergreen and deciduous trees related to the trade-off described by the leaf economics spectrum, i.e., short-lived leaves with higher assimilation rates in deciduous and longer-lived leaves with a greater drought tolerance in evergreen species.

It is shown that the relative ratio of CO oxidization dramatically varies with combustion time at early burning stage in the presence of iron species, and all peak values are greater than 2.4. The relative ratio of CO oxidization decreases with the increase of air stoichiometric ratio and CO concentration in off-gas. The circulation reactions of Fe FeO/FeO(2)-Fe achieve the catalytic effect on CO oxidization. Gaseous iron species can greatly inhibit NO formation, NO reduction ratio can reach above 70% at T = 2073 and 2273 K, and gaseous iron species can effectively inhibit NO formation when combustion temperature is not higher than 2273 K during the off-gas combustion. There are O(2) competitive reactions between thermal NO formation and Fe oxidization, and high chemical activity of iron species inhibits thermal-NO formation.

Here, few layer Ti3C2 nanosheets/copper composite coatings are designed and synthesized by a facile electrodeposition technique at room temperature. Their tribological behaviors are studied under dry sliding. Post-test observations including morphology and composition analysis on the wear tracks along with counterpart are conducted to understand their friction and wear mechanisms. The results show that Ti(3)C(2 )nanosheets/copper composite coatings exhibit lower of friction and wear rate than their Ti3C2-free counterparts.

Folate deficiency has been associated with many pathologies. However, much less is known about the effect of it on human reproduction, especially on implantation. The establishment of uterine receptivity is crucial for successful embryo implantation. Gene expression can be influenced by both heredity and epigenetics such as DNA methylation. However, it is not known whether the methylation and expression of genes related to uterine receptivity can be affected by folate levels. To explore whether folate deficiency affected the epigenetic regulation of genes related to uterine receptivity, and their influence on implantation, we investigated the methylation and expression of cadherin 1 (Cdh1), progesterone receptor (Pgr) and estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) genes during implantation and the implantation efficiency using a folate-deficient pregnant mouse model. Serum folate levels of pregnant mice were measured using the electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. The methylation status of Cdh1, Pgr and Esr1 promoter regions was determined by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. The expression of Cdh1, Pgr and Esr1 in the implantation-site endometrium was examined by real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. The number and the morphology of pinopodes, important morphological markers of endometrial receptivity, were examined using scanning electron microscopy. The number of implantation sites demarcated by distinct blue bands was recorded. Serum folate levels of the folate-deficient group were lower (5.42 1.35 ng/ml, n 42) than those of the normal group (24.13 4 .26 ng/ml, n 37; P 0.003). Here we show that the methylation status and mRNA levels of Esr1 were decreased (P 0.021, P 0.045, respectively), while the Cdh1 and Pgr expression levels were slightly but not significantly elevated and the methylation status did not vary in the folate-deficient mice compared with the wild type. Neither the number nor morphology of pinopodes was affected by folate deficiency. Furthermore, folate deficiency did not affect the number of implantation sites in mice. This study demonstrates for the first time that, unlike the effects on Esr1, folate deficiency in mice does not influence the methylation and expression of Pgr and Cdh1, two genes shown to be essential for uterine receptivity and embryo implantation. Embryo implantation in mice appears to be unaffected by a deficiency in folate, suggesting that abnormalities in a pregnancy caused by folate deficiency start to develop after implantation.

Effects of simulated N deposition on photosynthesis and productivity of key plants from different functional groups of alpine meadow on Qinghai-Tibetan plateau	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						N deposition; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Alpine meadow; Productivity; Photosynthesis	NITROGEN CRITICAL LOADS; LONG-TERM NITROGEN; SPECIES RICHNESS; NUTRIENT STATUS; USE EFFICIENCY; N2O EMISSIONS; SOIL; GROWTH; DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM	Nitrogen (N) deposition may alter physiological process of plants in grassland ecosystem. However, little is known about the response mechanism of individual plants in alpine regions to N deposition. We conducted a field experiment, and three treatments including 0 kg Nha(-l) year(-1) (CK), 8 kgNha(-l) year(-1) (Low N), and 72 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (High N) were established to simulate N deposition in alpine meadow of Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Our objectives were to determine the influence of N deposition on photosynthesis of different functional types of herbage species in alpine meadow, and finally characterize the links of plant productivity and photosynthesis with soil nutrients. The results showed that responses of alpine plants were species-specific under N deposition. Compared with grass species Agropyron cristatum and forb species Thalictrum aquilegifolium, the sedge species Carex melanantha was much more sensitive to N deposition; a lower N load (8 kgNha(-1)year(-1)) can cause a negative effect on its photosynthesis and productivity. Additionally, N deposition can promote plant N uptake and significantly decreased the C (carbon)/N (nitrogen) ratio. Compared with CK and low N deposition, high N deposition inhibited the photosynthesis and growth of the forb species Thalictrum aquilegifolium and sedge species Carex melanantha. In all three functional types of herbage species, the grass species A. cristatum tended to show a much higher photosynthetic capacity and better growth potential; thus, suggesting that grass species A. cristatum will be a more adaptative alpine plants under N deposition. Our findings suggested that plant photosynthetic responses to N deposition were species-specific, low N deposition was not beneficial for all the herbage species, and N deposition may change plant composition by the differential photosynthetic responses among species in alpine grassland. Plant composition shift to grass-dorminant in alpine regions might be attributed to a much higher photosynthetic potential and N use efficiency of grass species. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the protein model was first split to produce the disassembled BSA (dBSA) of linear polymer and then coupled with catalytic Hemin (Hem). The yielded dBSA-Hem scaffolds were utilized to in-site encapsulate gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) through biominerization, yielding the dBSA-Hem-AuNCs. It was discovered that the nanocomposites could display the well-defined composition and spheric morphology. In particular, they could exhibit unexpectedly strong catalysis, electrocatalysis, and fluorescence properties, in which the biominerized AuNCs would act as fluorescence sources and "nanowires" for promoting the electron-transfer of the catalytic nanocomposites. Colorimetric investigations show that the developed enzyme mimics could present peroxidase-like catalysis activities comparable to natural horseradish peroxidase. In addition, they could facilitate the direct electrocatalysis for H2O2 at concentrations as low as 0.40 mu M. Moreover, strong red fluorescence of AuNCs in nanocomposites could be expected for the fluorimetric analysis of H2O2 with linear concentrations ranging from 50 nM to 100 mu M. Such a biomimetic assembly route may open a new door toward the preparation of diverse nanocomposites with multifunctional catalysis and fluorescence, thus promising extensive applications of catalysis and detection in the chemical, environmental, and biomedical fields.

Application of organic-inorganic hybrids in lithium batteries	MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS			English	Article						Organic-inorganic hybrid; Lithium batteries; Energy conversion/storage	LI-S BATTERIES; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; HIGH-PERFORMANCE ANODE; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; ENERGY-STORAGE; POROUS CARBON; CATHODE MATERIALS; LI-O-2 BATTERIES; FRAMEWORK DERIVATION; POLYMER ELECTROLYTES	To address the increasing energy demand, rapid consumption of non-renewable fuels, and serious environmental problems, it is very crucial to develop efficient, economical, and environmental-friendly energy conversion/storage devices. Lithium batteries are one of the most attractive and encouraging candidates. However, up to date, their performance is still far from satisfactory. Hence, researchers have been focusing on developing suitable materials as efficient electrodes, separators, electrolytes, etc., to improve their performance. Among all the diverse materials, organic-inorganic hybrids have attracted much attention because they not only possess characteristics of both the organic and inorganic parts but also own specific properties generated from their synergistic effects. It is feasible to obtain organicinorganic hybrids with desirable properties through the proper hybridization of suitable organic and inorganic precursors. Herein, we made a brief summary of the categories, synthesis strategies, and application of organic-inorganic hybrids in lithium batteries, with special emphasis on the construction of favored organic-inorganic hybrids and their derivatives as efficient electrodes and separators for lithium batteries. These organic-inorganic hybrids have demonstrated their potential to enhance the performance of lithium batteries and other energy conversion/storage devices to the satisfactory level.

Circular-shaped microdimple arrays with different dimple center distances and dimple depths are implemented on the ball surface to quantify the impacts of these two parameters on the friction coefficient and the maximum ball surface temperature. In addition, the contacts of three surface texture combinations, namely microdimpled and polished ball surface versus polished disk surface, polished ball surface versus polished disk surface, and ground ball surface versus ground disk surface, are compared to demonstrate any beneficial or detrimental effect of microdimples in heavily loaded high-speed applications. This study adopts a thermal mixed EHL point contact model, whose capability and accuracy have been well demonstrated by comparing to the experimental measurements, to quantify the deterministic tribological behavior within the contact, allowing the exploration of the underlying mechanism that governs the role of microdimples in the elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL).

The reaction was confirmed to exhibit the pseudo first-order kinetics. Compared with the original Ni foam cathode, the fabricated electrode exhibited higher catalytic activity, attributed to its strong cross-linking and ability to produce catalytic free radicals. Radical scavenger experiments revealed that O-2(-center dot) and (OH)-O-center dot were involved in the decomposition of TBBPA. The effects of current density, pH, catalyst dosage, and initial TBBPA concentration on removal efficiency were further studied. An optimal removal rate of 98.3% was achieved while the rate constant reached values up to 0,07293 min(-1) and the debromination rate was more than 75.4% within 60 min, The electrode showed high catalytic performance and low catalyst loss after 10 cycles, indicating its excellent stability and reusability. The probable mechanism and pathway of TBBPA degradation were suggested based on the analysis of intermediate products. It could be inferred that the decomposition of TBBPA involved C-C bond breaks (oxidation) and debromination (reduction). The MnO2/MWCNT-Ni foam could be a promising cathode material for electrochemical degradation of halogenated organic compounds.

Herein, we design and synthesize a class of Q[n]-POM hybrids and tetramethyl cucurbit[6]uril-phosphomolybdic acid (TMeQ[6]-PMA) nanocubes (NCs)viaa facile one-step self-assembly method, as heterogeneous acid catalysts for greatly boosting the catalysts in term of activity and stability for the esterification of gallic acid andn-propanol to propyl gallate (PG). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals that the self-assembled mechanism of TMeQ[6]-PMA NCs based on the outer-surface interaction of Q[n]s. The temperature programmed desorption experiments with ammonia and FTIR analysis of the pre-adsorbed pyridine results confirm that the coexistence of medium and strong acid sites and a larger number of Lewis acid sites other than Bronsted acidic sites on the catalyst surface. These new features make the as-prepared TMeQ[6]-PMA NCs exhibit a high PG conversion (95.6%) and excellent stability, which represents a better catalytic performance than other reported catalysts.

One of the major interests is the sake of getting a higher magnetoresistance (MR) ratio to facilitate industrial applications. However, miscellaneous effects are mixed in the obtained MR and the contributions of 2-D materials are not clearly distinguished even. In this article, we report the angle-dependent MR in WSe2 SV for different orientations of applied magnetic field. By setting reference samples with different structures, the contributions of anisotropic MR (AMR) and MR of 2-D materials are distinguished. The MR ratios generated by WSe2 show a monotonic decreasing trend with the increasing included angle between the direction of magnetic field and the length axis of bottom electrode Py. The related angular variation in such SV structure can be used for future researches and industrial applications.

However, limited works have been conducted in the Zhongcang Basin. To gain knowledge on hydrocarbon potential of this area acid further investigate the organic matter (OM) accumulation mechanisms of source rocks in the BNSZ basins, samples collected along two measured sections from the Zhongcang Basin were subjected to sedimentological, organic geochemical and petrographic analyses. Sedimentological analyses indicate that all samples were deposited in prodeltic to deep lake environments. Total organic carbon (TOC) values and pyrolysis data suggest a poor to fair hydrocarbon source potential of the middle Dingqinghu Formation, with the exception of OM-rich samples locate in a marker bed of the upper part. Vitrinite reflectance (Ro) values of the upper part and middle lower part samples range from 0.41 to 0.50 and 0.52 to 0.61, indicating immature and marginal mature stages, respectively. These maturity levels were also supported by specific maturity indices of sample extracts, such as ratios of C-31 22S/(22S + 22R) homohopanes and C-29 beta beta/(alpha alpha + beta beta) steranes. Bulk geochemistry, maceral composition of kerogen, and extract biomarkers demonstrate that OM-rich samples were deposited in fresh to brackish waters with type II-III kerogen mainly derived from algae and higher plants; while poor to fair samples have less higher plant contribution, but relatively high bacterial content that probably originated from more saline environments. The paleoclimate-induced environmental reorganization is likely responsible for the differential OM accumulation in the Zhongcang Basin; relatively wet climates would facilitate primary productivity of the lake as well as development of swamps on the delta, resulting in deposition of mixed terrestrial and aquatic OM with higher TOC, whilst dry conditions would restrict the development of river systems and promote the establishment of saline environments, causing decreased total OM input but increased proportion of halophilic bacterial OM. In addition, we summarized published data of the Dingqinghu Formation in the BNSZ basins and preliminarily reconstructed paleogeography of central Tibet. Two types of drainage patterns were confirmed in this area. A long-lived hierarchical drainage system is developed in the Lunpola area, while single lake systems were prevalent in other basins, including the Zhongcang Basin. The hierarchical drainage pattern could minimize clastic dilution effects during tectonic active and/or relatively wet periods, and prevent the establishment of hypersaline environments during the dry period. The drainage center in this kind of hierarchical system has lower sedimentation accumulation rate and could receive much more aquatic OM at any climatic conditions. We argue that tectonic-induced drainage organization primarily controlled the hydrocarbon potential differentiation between lake basins of central Tibet.

This material presents excellent electrochemical performance with long cyclability and high specific capacity. Its specific capacity remained above 460 mAh g(-1) with 90% capacity retention after 100 cycles between 0 and 3 V at 0.3 mA cm(-2). The columbic efficiency after the second cycle was nearly 100%. The structure transformation occurring for the first lithium extraction is the key factor for the material to gain high reversible capacity. (c) 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

However, pristine BP exhibits predominant p-type channel conductance, which limits the realization of complementary circuits unless an effective n-type doping is found. Here, a practical approach to transform the conductivity of BP from p-type to n-type via a spatially controlled aluminum (Al) doping is proposed. Symmetrical threshold voltage for the pair of p-type and n-type BP field-effect transistors can be achieved by tuning the Al doping concentration. The complementary inverter circuit shows a clear logic inversion with a high voltage gain of up to approximate to 11 at a supply voltage (V-DD) of 1.5 V. Simultaneously, a high noise margin of 0.27 x V-DD is achieved for both low (NML) and high (NMH) input voltages, indicating excellent noise immunity. Moreover, a three-stage ring oscillator with a theoretical frequency above 1.8 GHz and microwatt level power dissipation is modeled, which shows a low propagation delay per stage. This study demonstrates a practical approach to fabricate high performance complementary integrated circuits on a homogenous BP channel material, paving the way toward complex cascaded circuits and sensor interface applications.

In-situ sulfonation of targeted silica-filled Nafion for high-temperature PEM fuel cell application	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						High-temperature fuel cell; Nafion (R) membrane; Targeted filling; In-situ sulfonation; Low humidity; Non-destructive modification	COMPOSITE MEMBRANES; ACID; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; LIQUID	Silica targeted filled in Nafion membrane is in-situ sulfonated (s-WR-Nafion membrane) to improve the proton conductivity at high-temperature and low relative humidity (RH). The silica introduction as water sorbent in the membrane can both stabilize water balance for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and prevent the formation of the water crystalline phase in membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) in course of sub-zero temperature operation (so-called cold start) owing to chemical water adsorption. On the other hand, water presence in MEAs provides required operating humidity when temperature increases. Due to the synergistic effect of the targeted filled silica and the efficient -SO3H based proton conductive channel, high temperature proton conductivity of the Nafion membrane is therefore significantly improved at low RH. Particularly, proton conductivity of the s-WR-Nafion membrane is raised to 0.07 S/cm at 110 degrees C and 60% RH. At the same time, mechanical, oxidative and thermal stabilities of the s-WR-Nafion membrane are not decayed due to the integrity of the original structure of Nafion (R). As a result, the maximum output power of the s-WR-Nafion membrane-based fuel cell is ca. 65% higher than that of the pristine Nafion (R) membrane at 110 degrees C and 20% RH. Above all, the s-WR-Nafion membrane exhibit promising application potential for high-temperature PEMFC. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, an ultrathin LiBO2 layer with an extremely high Young's modulus of 8.0 GPa is constructed on Li anode via an in situ reaction between Li metal and 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxa-borolane (TDB) to form LiBO2@Li anode, which presents two times higher exchange current density than pristine Li anode. The LiBO2 layer presents a strong absorption to Li ions and greatly improves the interfacial dynamics of Li-ion migration, which induces homogenous lithium nucleation and deposition to form a dense lithium layer. Consequently, the Li dendrite growth during cycling at subambient temperature and the side reactions with electrolyte at high temperature are simultaneously suppressed. The LiBO2@Li/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) full batteries with limited Li capacity and high cathode mass loading of 9.9 mg cm(-2) can steadily cycle for 300 cycles with a capacity retention of 86.6%. The LiBO2@Li/NCM811 full batteries and LiBO2@Li/LiBO2@Li symmetric batteries also present excellent cycling performance at both -20 and 60 degrees C. This work develops a strategy to achieve outstanding performance of LMBs at wide working temperature-range.

Eighteen CHB-fibrosis patients and 12 CHB patients without fibrosis were enrolled. The CHB-fibrosis group included 9 patients with the TCM syndrome of Ganyu Pixu Xueyu (GYPXXY), characterized by liver stagnation, spleen deficiency, and blood stasis, and 9 patients with the TCM syndrome of Qixu Xueyu (QXXY), characterized by deficiency of qi, blood, and blood stasis. Agilent miRNA microarray was performed first in liver specimens to determine whether miRNA expression is different in patients with these two TCM syndromes of CHB-fibrosis. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG analysis were applied to determine the roles of the differentially expressed miRNAs. QRT-PCR was performed to validate the Agilent miRNA microarray results. Compared with GYPXXY patients, 6 differentially expressed miRNAs were upregulated (miR-144-5p, miR-18a-5p, miR-148b-3p, miR-654-3p, miR-139-3p, and miR-24-1-5p) and 1 was downregulated (miR-6834-3p) in QXXY patients. According to qRT-PCR data, miR-144-5p and miR-654-3p were confirmed as upregulated in CHB-liver fibrosis patients compared to CHB patients without fibrosis, whereas the other 4 miRNAs were not significantly different. More importantly, miR-654-3p was confirmed to be significantly upregulated in QXXY patients compared with values in GYPXXY patients, whereas no significant difference was found in miR-144-5p. Moreover, the pathways of central carbon metabolism in cancer and cell cycle related to miR-654-3p and the target genes of PTEN and ATM were found to be different between QXXY patients and GYPXXY patients. These results indicate that there are different miRNAs, pathways, and target genes between QXXY patients and GYPXXY patients.

Numerous mosquito-transmitted viruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus circulate in this area. This project was to describe seasonal patterns in mosquito species abundance and arbovirus activity in the mosquito populations. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected in Mangshi and Ruili cities of Dehong Prefecture near the border of China and Burma in Yunnan Province, the Peoples Republic of China in 2010. We monitored mosquito species abundance for a 12-month period using ultraviolet light, carbon dioxide baited CDC light and gravid traps; and tested the captured mosquitoes for the presence of virus to evaluate mosquito-virus associations in rural/agricultural settings in the area. Results: A total of 43 species of mosquitoes from seven genera were collected, including 15 Culex species, 15 Anopheles spp., four Aedes spp., three Armigeres spp., one Mimomyia spp., two Uranotaenia spp. and three Mansonia spp.. Species richness and diversity varied between Mangshi and Ruili. Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles sinensis and Anopheles peditaeniatus were the most abundant species in both sampling sites. Ultraviolet light traps collected more specimens than CDC light traps baited with dry ice, though both collected the same variety of mosquito species. The CDC gravid trap was the most effective trap for capture of Culex quinquefasciatus, a species underrepresented in light trap collections. A total of 26 virus strains were isolated, which included 13 strains of Japanese encephalitis virus, four strains of Getah virus, one strain of Oya virus, one strain from the orbivirus genus, and seven strains of Culex pipien pallens densovirus. Conclusions: The present study illustrates the value of monitoring mosquito populations and mosquito-transmitted viruses year-round in areas where the climate supports year-round adult mosquito activity.

J	Zhou, J; Zhang, Y; Li, S; Chen, J				Zhou, Jun; Zhang, Yue; Li, Song; Chen, Jing			Ni/NiO Nanocomposites with Rich Oxygen Vacancies as High-Performance Catalysts for Nitrophenol Hydrogenation	CATALYSTS			English	Article						metal-oxide interaction; oxygen vacancy; hydrogenation; catalyst	METAL-FREE CATALYSTS; CO OXIDATION; REDUCTION; NANOPARTICLES; GRAPHENE; NI; NANOMATERIALS	Heterogeneous catalysis often involves charge transfer between adsorbed molecules and the surface of catalyst, and thus their activity depends on the surface charge density. The efficiency of charge transfer could be optimized by adjusting the concentration of oxygen vacancies (O-v). In this work, hexagonal Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles were initially synthesized by a hydrothermal process using aluminum powder as the sacrificial agent, and were then converted into 2D Ni/NiO nanocomposites through in situ reduction in hydrogen flow. The oxygen vacancy concentration in the NiO nanosheet could be well-controlled by adjusting the reduction temperature. This resulted in strikingly high activities for hydrogenation of nitrophenol. The Ni/NiO nanocomposite could easily be recovered by a magnetic field for reuse. The present finding is beneficial for producing better hydrogenation catalysts and paves the way for the design of highly efficient catalysts.

Ecteinascidin 743 could be obtained with traditional liquid extraction, but it should be purified and separated from the extract. A molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction procedure was developed for the selective separation. Ecteinascidin 743 was used as the template and the polymer was synthesized in a methanol environment. Water and n-hexane as the washing solvents can eliminate most of the interference. Good linearity and low relative standard deviations (less than 4.39%) justify its continuing development.

Herein, we have reported a photothermal-immunotherapy of melanoma using pegylated black phosphorus nanosheets (BP-PEG NSs) and imiquimod (R837) as the photothermal conversion agent and the immunoadjuvant, respectively. The photothermal stability of BP NSs was remarkably enhanced after the modification of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) by electrostatic interactions. The in situ generation of tumor-associated antigens by PTT elicited a strong immune response in the presence of R837, achieving a photoimmunotherapy of B16 melanoma. This photoimmunotherapy stimulated a stronger immune response both in vitro and in vivo than monotherapy, inducing a much greater release of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha. In vivo antitumor studies in B16 tumor-bearing mice demonstrated that photoimmunotherapy showed the best tumor inhibition effects. Our study suggested that BP-PEG NS-based PTT primed with an immunoadjuvant can be used for synergistic photoimmunotherapy of melanomas.

Some potential parameters influencing the MSPE efficiency were optimized using response surface methodology (RSIVI). Under the optimal experimental conditions an approach for the analysis of Sudan dyes was developed by coupling with high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Good linearity (r > 0.9932) with linear range of 0.05-50 ng L-1 was obtained. The enrichment factors, LODs and LOQs for the proposed method were found to be in the ranges of 80.9-88.9, 0.02-0.05 ng g(-1) and 0.07-0.17 ng g(-1), respectively. The method was utilized to analyze target Sudan dyes in real chili sauce samples, and sufficient recoveries ranged from 92.6 to 98.6% were obtained with RSDs < 5.8%. These results indicate that the prepared Fe3O4@NPI is an effective sorbent for the extraction of Sudan dyes prior determination.

Firstly we calculated the bonding energy of the single Pt atoms on (2x2), (3x3) and (4x4) penta-B2C supercells, and chose (3x3) penta-B2C for the subsequent simulations. Secondly we confirmed that the single Pt atom on penta-B2C is stable. And then we stepwise investigated the growth pattern of Pt clusters. The result indicates that the Pt-1, Pt-2 and Pt-4 clusters on penta-B2C are stable, and the single Pt atom on penta-B2C is the most stable structure. Based on the analysis of the electronic structure and the frontier molecular orbitals, the Pt-1, Pt-2 and Pt-4 clusters on penta-B2C have the potential to be used as the efficient catalysts.

In this study, emissions from ships at berth in Guangzhou, southern China, were characterized before and after the implementation of the fuel switch policy (IFSP) with an FSC limit of 0.5% in the Pearl River Delta ECA (ECA-PRD). After IFSP, the emission factors (EFs) of SO2 and PM2.5 for the coastal vessels decreased by 78% and 56% on average, respectively; however, the EFs of the VOCs were 1807 +/- 1746 mg kg(-1), approximately 15 times that of 118 +/- 56.1 mg kg(-1) before IFSP. This dramatic increase in the emissions of the VOCs might have been largely due to the replacement of high-sulfur residual fuel oil with low-sulfur diesel or heavy oils, which are typically richer in short-chain hydrocarbons. Moreover, reactive alkenes surpassed alkanes to become the dominant group among the VOCs, and low-carbon-number VOCs, such as ethylene, propene and isobutane, became the dominant species after IFSP. As a result of the largely elevated EFs of the reactive alkenes and aromatics after IFSP, the emitted VOCs per kilogram of fuel burned had nearly 29 times greater ozone formation potential (OFP) and approximately 2 times greater secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) than those before IFSP. Unlike the coastal vessels, the river vessels in the region used diesel fuels consistently and were not affected by the fuel switch policy, but the EFs of their VOCs were 90% greater than those of the coastal vessels after IFSP, with approximately 120% greater fuel-based OFP and 70 %-140% greater SOAFP. The results from this study suggest that while the fuel switch policy could effectively reduce SO2 and PM emissions, and thus help control PM2.5 pollution, it will also lead to greater emissions of reactive VOCs, which may threaten ozone pollution control in harbor cities. This change for coastal or ocean-going vessels, in addition to the large amounts of reactive VOCs from the river vessels, raises regulatory concerns for ship emissions of reactive VOCs.

Here by a Zr-based treatment to create bulk Fe2ZrO5 in hematite and a F-based treatment to form an ultrathin surface FeFx layer, the charge transfer can be highly improved and the charge recombination can be significantly suppressed. As a result, the FeFx/Zr-Fe(2)O(3 & nbsp;)photoanode presents an enhanced PEC performance with a photocurrent density of 2.43 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is around 3 times higher than that of the pristine Fe2O3. The FeFx/Zr-Fe(2)O(3 & nbsp;)photoanode also shows a low onset potential of 0.77 V vs. RHE (100 mV lower than the pristine hematite). The performance is much higher than that of the sample treated by Zr or F alone, suggesting the synergistic effect between bulk Fe2ZrO5 and surface FeFx. By coupling with the FeNiOOH co-catalyst, the final photoanode can achieve a high photocurrent density of 2.81 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The novel design of Zr and F co-modified hematite can be used as a promising way to pre-pare efficient catalysts for solar water splitting.

We applied two different models for estimating erosion rates from observed Be-10(m) concentrations (a one-dimensional model predicting vertical profiles of Be-10(m) within hillslope soils [loss only, diffusion only, LODO] and a two-dimensional model predicting the concurrent evolution of hillslope topography and Be-10(m) distributions via bioturbation, chemical mobility, and surface erosion [Be2D]). Both models were used to derive pre-European and post-European settlement erosion rates (E-nat and E-post, respectively) across paired cultivated and uncultivated hillslopes in west-central Minnesota, USA. E-post estimates from Be-10(m) were compared to E-post estimates derived from Cs-137 inventories and the process-based Water and Tillage Erosion Model (WaTEM). The results from these models suggest that erosion rates from upper positions on the cultivated hillslope have increased from an average of 0.047mm/year under natural conditions to E-post values of 3.09mm/year. The Be2D and LODO models, on average, produced E-post estimates that were similar in magnitude to WaTEM and Cs-137 conversion models. This numerical convergence does not imply absolute Be-10(m) model accuracy, particularly when considering the uncertainties inherent in each approach, but it does suggest that the orders of magnitude increase in estimated erosion rates from E-nat to E-post is robust. Additionally, the pattern of E-post estimates produced using Be-10(m) conversion models is supported by the distribution of soil inorganic carbon at the study site. Our results demonstrate that Be-10(m) can provide reasonable estimates of both predisturbance and postdisturbance erosion rates in landscapes that have undergone extensive human modification. Plain Language Summary Agricultural practices have substantially changed soil erosion rates in the Midwestern United States. Although much work has been devoted to understanding the changes in soil erosion rates with land cover change, the ability to quantify those changes at discrete locations on the landscape over long periods of time has been limited. We use a set of tracers and models to estimate presettlement and postsettlement erosion rates on a hillslope in west-central Minnesota, USA, and show that soil erosion has increased by approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over a period of approximately 110years. This has implications for how we view our current agricultural landscapes and how we think about soil sustainability in the future.

In the present study, corrosion experiments of X65 pipeline steel were performed with an imidazoline-based corrosion inhibitor using a high-shear turbulent channel flow cell, which included a flow disturbance in the form of a small protrusion. Localized corrosion was observed at the protrusion that could be mitigated with an excess inhibitor concentration. It was found that wall shear stress (up to 5000 Pa) was not the cause of inhibitor failure. The flow acceleration at the leading edge of the protrusion caused a drop in pressure and led to cavitation, with bubble collapse further downstream. This was the main cause of inhibitor failure and localized corrosion. The observed behavior was interpreted in terms of corrosion inhibitor adsorption/desorption kinetics and the associated activation energy analysis.	[Li, Wei; Pots, B. F.

Due to the different coordination numbers of iron-sulfur, the free energies of the dehydrogenation steps on FeS2 are far less than those on Fe3S4, which led to the much better catalytic performance of FeS2. Accordingly, FeS2 microspheres are rationally proposed as a more efficient electrocatalyst for hydrazine oxidation, which is then prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal strategy. Such FeS2 microspheres show great activity for hydrazine oxidation with an onset oxidation potential of 0.22 V vs . reversible hydrogen electrode, and a peak current density of 16 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, stability and high faradaic efficiency (3.5e(-)/N2H4) is obtained for hydrazine oxidation to N-2 . (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Chinese Society for Metals.

Moreover, in the rectangular Ag-Si-SiO2 cavity, the amplitude of Re(E) changed as the silicon height d varied, and maximum amplitude A of Re(E) could be approximated as the functions of transverse length l and thickness t of silver film under small scattering angle. Re(E) was independent of the transverse length w(2) and the longitudinal length d of the cavity in RCM and was also irrelevant with the dielectric constant of silver films.

The metal cation is bonded with three nitrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms of L and one chloride ion to form a distorted octahedral geometry. This complex coordinated with macrocyclic ligand possesses large pore volume that will be contributed to observe high H-2 adsorption. With respect to the first-principles electronic structure calculations, the feasibility to store hydrogen in the complex is explored. Indeed, the complex has shown a very high total H-2 adsorption of 7.2 wt% (wt% = (weight of adsorbed H-2)/(weight of host material)), with a binding energy of 0.03 eV/H-2.

The MCR was manufactured by winding a tapered fibre on a polycarbonate (PC) resin cylinder with low refractive index to support the microfibre, which also forms a fluidic channel coil. The MXene dispersion was injected into the channel to allow the deposition of an MXene layer using a photodeposition process. The transmission spectra were tuned using a tunable laser with a centre wavelength of 1550 nm and the light-matter interaction resulting from the photo-thermal effect and MXene absorption provide the all-optical modulation in this device. The variation of the resonance wavelength, phase shift and extinction ratio of transmission spectrum versus power were determined as 50 pm/mW, 0.262 pi/mW and 0.554 dBm/mW respectively. The all-optical modulation properties were further characterized using a lens coupling method and adding a chopper to provide a controlled light source. The rise and fall response times for waveforms of the light signal were 0.179 and 0.145 ms, respectively. The intensity and width of the light signal waveform was modulated using the chopper controlled light source, which indicates that MXene, as a new two-dimensional material, has excellent nonlinear optical effects and the MXene-MCR has the potential for use in ultra-fast optical nonlinear optical processing. The MXene-MCR has several superior characteristics compared with other all-optical modulators including excellent modulation properties, all-fibre construction, easy fabrication and fast response. These advantages demonstrate MXene-MCR has excellent potential for use as a tunable optical filter, an optical switch as well as an all-optical modulator.

Stable electron field emission from triangular-shaped ZnO nanoplate arrays with low local heating effects	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CARBON NANOTUBES	We show here successful large-area growth of triangular-shaped ZnO nanoplate arrays on silicon substrates and the investigation of their electron field emission properties. The special geometric-shaped nanoplate emitters have a very large surface area for heat dissipation and large field enhancement factors. These lead to very stable and low-threshold field emission. The fluctuations of the macroscopic current density are less than 1.5%. The threshold macroscopic field is about 4.3 V mu m(-1) at an emitter-anode gap of 525 mu m. The stable electron field emission is ascribed to low local heating effects, originating from the superior heat dissipation ability and the low Joule heating of the sheet-like emitters. Plotting Fowler-Nordheim curves yields straight lines with small deviations at low and high macroscopic fields. The origins of these deviations are discussed. Our experiments demonstrate a promising design for stable and efficient emitters.

Nonlinear optical absorption tuning in Bi3.15Nd0.85Ti3O12 ferroelectric thin films by thickness	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							REVERSE SATURABLE ABSORPTION; CRYSTALS; GRAPHENE	The tunability of nonlinear optical (NLO) absorption in Bi3.15Nd0.85Ti3O12 (BNT) ferroelectric thin films was investigated through the open aperture Z-scan method with femtosecond laser pulses at the wavelength of 800 nm. NLO absorption responses of the BNT films were observed to be highly sensitive to the film thickness. As the film thickness increases from 106.8 to 139.7 nm, the NLO absorption changes from saturable absorption (SA) to reverse saturable absorption (RSA). When the film thickness further increases to 312.9 nm, the RSA effect is enhanced. A band-gap-related competition between the ground-state excitation and the two-photon absorption is responsible for the absorption switching behavior. Such a tunable NLO absorption can widen the photonic application of the BNT thin films. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Li, S.; Zhong, X. L.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, J. B.; Song, H. J.; Tan, C.

Bending Vertically and Horizontally of Compressive Nano-rods Subjected to Nonlinearly Distributed Loads Using a Continuum Theoretical Approach	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Bending vertically and horizontally; Compressive nano-rod; Nonlinearly distributed; Nonlocal continuum; Scale effect	WALLED CARBON NANOTUBE; NONLOCAL ELASTICITY; FREE-VIBRATION; WAVE-PROPAGATION; STRESS	Purpose In nano-electro-mechanical systems, a component named a compressive nano-rod sometimes bears lateral and axial loads at the same time, resulting in a vertical and horizontal bending deformation. Motivated by it, this paper presents the bending vertically and horizontally of a compressive nano-rod, and the nano-rod is subjected to lateral nonlinearly distributed loads and axial compressive stresses initially. Different from the previous studies most of which were concerned on a simply supported compressive rod with linear loads, a statically indeterminate fixed-fixed compressive nano-rod is investigated. Methods Based on the strain gradient type of nonlocal continuum theory, we derive the theoretical formulations analytically. To this end, the nonlocal differential constitutions for stress and bending moment provide the bases of theoretical modeling. The effects of an internal characteristic scale and other external parameters on bending vertically and horizontally including the limit compressive stress, bending deflection and bending moment are examined, respectively, via the explicit results obtained in the theoretical model. Results and Conclusions It shows that the limit compressive stress decreases due to the existence of the nonlocal scale effect, but it increases with increasing the material stiffness of nano-rods. Hence, the critical value of material stiffness is predicted. If the material stiffness is higher than its critical value, the bending vertically and horizontally of compressive nano-rods with nonlinear loads is stale, while it turns to be instable if the material stiffness is lower than its critical value. Moreover, the nonlocal scale and material stiffness are coupled in bending vertically and horizontally. The work can offer a reference for designing, regulating and controlling the compressive nano-rods with nonlinearly distributed loads.	[Wang, P.

Measurements of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) using PTR-MS: calibration, humidity dependence, inter-comparison and results from field studies in an oil and gas production region	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							PROTON-TRANSFER-REACTION; REACTION-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; REDUCED SULFUR-COMPOUNDS; FORMALDEHYDE MEASUREMENTS; CARBON-DISULFIDE; AIR; EMISSIONS; CHROMATOGRAPHY; VALIDATION; ATMOSPHERE	Natural gas production is associated with emissions of several trace gases, some of them classified as air toxics. While volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have received much attention, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can also be of concern due to the known health impacts of exposure to this hazardous air pollutant. Here, we present quantitative, fast time-response measurements of H2S using protontransfer-reaction mass-spectrometry (PTR-MS) instruments. An ultra-light-weight PTR-MS (ULW-PTR-MS) in a mobile laboratory was operated for measurements of VOCs and H2S in a gas and oil field during the Uintah Basin Winter Ozone Study (UBWOS) 2012 campaign. Measurements of VOCs and H2S by a PTR-MS were also made at the Horse Pool ground site in the Uintah Basin during UBWOS 2013. The H2S measurement by PTR-MS is strongly humidity dependent because the proton affinity of H2S is only slightly higher than that of water. The H2S sensitivity of PTR-MS ranged between 0.6-1.4 ncps ppbv-1 during UBWOS 2013. We compare the humidity dependence determined in the laboratory with in-field calibrations and determine the H2S mixing ratios for the mobile and ground measurements. The PTR-MS measurements at Horse Pool are evaluated by comparison with simultaneous H2S measurements using a PTR time-of-flight MS (PTR-ToF-MS) and a Picarro cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) instrument for H2S/CH4. On average 0.6 +/- 0.3 ppbv H2S was present at Horse Pool during UBWOS 2013. The correlation between H2S and methane enhancements suggests that the source of H2S is associated with oil and gas extraction in the basin. Significant H2S mixing ratios of up to 9 ppmv downwind of storage tanks were observed during the mobile measurements. This study suggests that H2S emissions associated with oil and gas production can lead to short-term high levels close to point sources, and elevated background levels away from those sources. In addition, our work has demonstrated that PTR-MS can make reliable measurements of H2S at levels below 1 ppbv.	[Li, R.; Warneke, C.; Graus, M.; Veres, P. R.; Roberts, J.

Solvent dependence on structure and supercapacitor performance of mesoporous NiCo2O4 grown on nickel foam	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS			English	Article						NiCo2O4; nanostructure; hydrothermal; electrochemical performance; supercapacitors	BINDER-FREE ELECTRODES; IN-SITU SYNTHESIS; ASYMMETRIC SUPERCAPACITORS; FACILE SYNTHESIS; NI FOAM; CYCLING-STABILITY; ARRAYS; NANOSHEET; GRAPHENE; CARBON	NiCo2O4 directly grown on nickel foam was fabricated via a simple hydrothermal method in glycol solution with different volume ratios of water to glycol with the aim to control the shape of as-prepared products. It was found that NiCo2O4 shape strongly depends on glycol content in reaction solution. As 1:0, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 volume ratios of water to glycol were selected, the corresponding NiCo2O4 exhibited 3D hierarchical honeycombs composed of numerous nanorods, 1D nanoneedles, 2D interconnected nanosheets and ultrathin nanosheets with numerous micropores, respectively. The morphology of NiCo2O4 has remarkable influence on electrochemical performance. The NiCo2O4 nanoneedles with open mesoporous structure and ultrathin nanosheets with numerous micropores displayed superior electrochemical properties than other products. The specific capacitances of NiCo2O4 nanoneedles and nanosheets can reach 708 and 634 F g(-1) at current density of 1 A g(-1), respectively. Rate capabilities 88.7% and 92.9% and cycling performance of 86.5% and 88% capacitance retentions at 5 A g(-1) after 2000 cycles were obtained.

PdFe NSs showed superior catalytic activity towards the oxidation of nitrite due to the large surface area of 2 dimensional (2D) nanostructure and the synergetic effect between Pd and Fe. A sensitive and selective electrochemical nitrite sensing platform was designed base on PdFe NSs and the amperometric technique. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 0.12 mu M (S/N=3), with a linear relationship between nitrite concentration and response current in the range of 1-160 mu M. The nitrite sensor was applied to analysis of nitrite in tap water and sausage successfully.

The experiment was performed in a 36-kW combustion reactor, and modeling prediction was done using the plug-flow reactor model. In the presence of H2O, the formation of free-radical H is conducive to NO reduction. H2O has a complex effect on NO emission: at T < 1100 degrees C, NO emission decreases with the increase of H2O content and temperature, the reaction pathway of NO reduction is NO -> HNO -> NH -> N2O -> N-2, and the controlling factors of NO reduction are temperature and H2O concentration; at 1100 degrees C < T < 1400 degrees C, NO emission decreases as the H2O content increases and remains constant with the change of temperature at [H2O] < 1.0%, NO reduction depends on H2O concentration rather than temperature, and increasing H2O concentration makes free-radical H reach high equilibrium concentration; at T > 1400 degrees C, the effects of H2O content and temperature on NO emission at [H2O] < 1.0% are similar to that at T < 1100 degrees C, NO emission increases with H2O content but decreases with temperature at [H2O] >1%, NO reduction depends on the combined effects of H and CO.

Regarding the fact that there are still inadequate experimental data of carrier mobility on the n-type compensated silicon, hence in this paper, both majority electron and minority hole mobilities measured on the n-type compensated solar-grade silicon substrates are presented. Prediction models of carrier mobility are essential for material characterization and device (e.g. solar cells) simulation. However, as prediction models of carrier mobility are commonly established based on the uncompensated silicon, large deviations of carrier mobility have been observed on the compensated silicon. In this work, the standard Klaassen's model and optimized model for the compensated silicon by Schindler et al. are reviewed and compared to measured carrier mobilities. Moreover, the factors that lead to deviations of Klaassen's model on the n-type compensated silicon are critically discussed, and then we propose an optimized model for prediction of carrier mobility in the compensated silicon. This model can also be extended to both majority and minority carrier mobilities in p-and n-type compensated silicon and fits well with previous published data as well as carrier mobility data presented here. In addition, evolutions of majority electron and minority hole mobilities as crystal grows are also simulated for n-type compensated Czochralski silicon which agrees well with our measured results.

Assessment of the effectiveness of riparian buffer zones by modeling method is widely used for watershed management as field measurement-based assessment is difficult and expensive. The integration of Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been developed to simulate the effect of nonpoint source pollution reduction by riparian buffer zones at subbasin scale. However, there are problems in using the integrated model at subbasin scale, as the size of subbasin partition could affect the pollutant reduction rate by riparian buffers. In this study, we partitioned a large watershed with size of 1331 ha into sub-watersheds with sizes of 666, 333, 166, 83, 51, and 29 ha, and then compared the different simulation results. We found that the modeling could yield more convergent results when the sub-watersheds were partitioned into suitable size. In the studied area, the suitable sub-watershed size was less than about 166 ha for runoff and nitrogen and 83 ha for sediment and phosphorus. Among the eight sub-watersheds (partitioned based on the size of 166 ha), results showed that the effects of riparian buffers on runoff and nutrient loading varied drastically. The reduction rate varied from 0.26% to 30.13% for runoff, 29.4% to 74.07% for sediment, 9.61% to 57.85% for nitrogen, and 18.61% to 68.12% for phosphorus, respectively.

Much attention is devoted to the structure design and the composite incorporation to develop the catalytic activity and durability of perovskite oxides used in the electrode. Herein, we propose an integration of atomic layered deposition iron oxide and perovskite LaNiO3 as a novel catalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the unique interconnected structure and the synergistic effect of Fe2O3 and LaNiO3, the 6 nm thick Fe2O3/LaNiO3 hybrid catalyst demonstrates the considerable intrinsic activities, which favorably outperforms other the state of the art perovskite catalysts. In addition, the Li-O-2 battery employing this tailored catalyst displays a significantly decreased reduced discharge/charge voltage gap of 0.77 V at 50 mA g(-1) with good rate capability and considerable cycle stability, indicating the practical feasibility of Fe2O3/LaNiO3 hybrid as a promising oxygen electrode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. This study highlights a new and feasible scheme to promote the bi-functionally of perovskite catalysts for the development of Li-O-2 batteries and other electrochemical devises.

A three point bending experiment device has been developed in order to simulate the Z-binder yarn bending condition. The effects of weft density, fabric thickness, and yarn tension have been studied. The Weibull analysis of the tensile strength show that the bending damage increases with the increase of weft density, fabric thickness, and yarn tension. The resulting bending damage causes a reduction in yarn strength of between 2.5 and 17.2% depending on the bending parameters of yarn. The growth of the fibrillation area also reflects similar trends with tensile strength loss rate. The fibrillation length produced by the yarns is mostly distributed within the range of 0.3 to 0.9 mm. A comparison of the calculation result to experimental data shows the bending fracture probability of filaments inside yarn are less than that of monofilament. The tensile and bending fracture of Si3N4 filaments exhibit typical brittle fracture characteristics.

Here, we demonstrate versatile soliton pulses in a passively mode-locked fiber laser with a WS2-deposited microfiber. The few-layer WS2 is prepared by the liquid-phase exfoliation method and transferred onto a microfiber by the optical deposition method. Study found, the WS2-deposited microfiber can operate simultaneously as a mode-locker and a high-nonlinear device. In experiment, by further inserting the WS2 device into the fiber laser, besides the dual-wavelength soliton, noise-like soliton pulse, conventional soliton and its harmonic form are obtained by properly adjusting the pump strength and the polarization states. For the dual-wavelength soliton pulses and noise-like pulse, the maximum output power of 14.2 mW and pulse energy of 4.74 nJ is obtained, respectively. In addition, we also achieve the maximum harmonic number (135) of conventional soliton, corresponding to a repetition rate of similar to 497.5 MHz. Our study shows clearly that WS2-deposited microfiber can be as a high-nonlinear photonic device for studying a plenty of nonlinear soliton phenomena. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, J; Feng, Y; Li, S; Lin, S				Wang Juan; Feng Yi; Li Shu; Lin Shen			Influence of graphite content on sliding wear characteristics of CNTs-Ag-G electrical contact materials	TRANSACTIONS OF NONFERROUS METALS SOCIETY OF CHINA			English	Article						CNTs-Ag-G electrical contact material; graphite; contact resistance; friction coefficient; wear mass loss	CARBON NANOTUBES; COMPOSITES; FRICTION; METAL	CNTs-Ag-G electrical contact composite material was prepared by means of powder metallurgical method. The influence of the graphite content on sliding wear characteristics of electrical contact levels was examined. In experiments, CNTs content was retained as 1% (mass fraction), and graphite was added at content levels of 8%, 10%, 13%, 15% and 18%, respectively. The results indicate that with the increase of graphite content, the contact resistance of electrical contacts is enhanced to a certain level then remains constant. Friction coefficient decreases gradually with the increase of graphite content. Wear mass loss decreases to the minimum value then increases. With the small content of graphite, the adhesive wear is hindered, which leads to the decrease of wear mass loss, while excessive graphite brings much more worn debris, resulting in the increase of mass loss. It is concluded that wear mass loss reaches the minimum value when the graphite mass fraction is about 13%. Compared with conventional Ag-G contact material, the wear mass loss of CNTs-Ag-G composite is much less due to the obvious increase of hardness and electrical conductivity, decline of friction surface temperature and inhibition of adhesive wear between composites and slip rings.

Energetically, the Se-top site of Janus MoSSe is the most favorable site for F-adsorption. Based on the adsorption, binding and formation energy analysis, it seems the fluorinated Janus MoSSe is stable. The analysis of the electronic density distribution and orbital hybrid shows that the fluorinated Janus MoSSe forms stable structure as well. Then, the electronic structure and work function change with the concentration of F atoms analyzed. With the increase of adsorbed F atoms, the bandgap of Janus MoSSe-F-x decreases from 1.456 (pristine case, x = 0) to 1.073 eV (semi-fluorinated case, x = 16), and changes from direct to indirect bandgap semiconductor. It is noteworthy that there are some additional doping levels near the valence band after F adsorbed, which originated from the F 2p doping states. The charge population analysis shows that electrons transfer was from Se to F atoms. It is worth noting that the charge on F atom (MoSSe-F-16) is two times more than Se atoms in pristine Janus MoSSe (MoSSe-F-0). As a result, the built-in electric field pointed from Mo to F atoms is enhanced, resulting in the tremendous increase of the work function for fluorinated Janus MoSSe. The work function changes from 5.22 eV (x = 0) in pristine case to 8.30 eV after semi-fluorinated (x = 16). Therefore, due to the adjustable work function and built-in electric field, the fluorinated Janus MoSSe monolayer shows better properties for applications in the piezoelectric device, optoelectronic device or photocatalyst.

The LiMn2O4 inherited the spherical morphology of the polymeric precursor but showed hollow porous structure assembled by nanocrystals of about 50-100 nm in size. When tested as cathode of Li-ion batteries, the LiMn2O4 hollow spheres exhibited excellent rate capability and cycle stability. A discharge capacity of above 90 mAh g(-1) was maintained at 10 C (1 C = 120 mAg(-1)), and the cells can still deliver a discharge capacity over 100 mAh g(-1) after another 115 cycles at 0.5 C. With such excellent electrochemical properties, the prepared LiMn2O4 hollow microspheres could be promising cathode of Li-ion batteries for long term and high power applications.

J	Rifai, SW; Li, S; Malhi, Y				Rifai, Sami W.; Li, Sihan; Malhi, Yadvinder			Coupling of El Nino events and long-term warming leads to pervasive climate extremes in the terrestrial tropics	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						El Nirio southern oscillation; terrestrial tropics; vapor pressure deficit; climatic water deficit; drought; ERA5	ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; RAINFALL; WATER	The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major driver of seasonal and interannual climatic variability across the tropics. The 2015/16 El Nino event was one of the strongest El Nino events of the past century. Here we characterize the meteorological impacts of the 2015/16 El Nino event upon the terrestrial tropics, and place the severity of this event into context of previous strong events in 1982/83 and 1997/98. Strong drought-inducing meteorological anomalies (>= 2s.d.) occurred across vast regions (20%) of the terrestrial tropics, where the wet tropics (>= 1200 mm yr(-1)) were more severely affected (33%) than the drier tropics (6%). Central and eastern Amazonia experienced the most sustained and spatially extensive drought inducing anomalies, while parts of the Congo basin and Insular Southeast Asia also experienced severe drought. Surprisingly, some regions of the tropics (e.g. the Guiana Shield) with well known ENSO teleconnections were only briefly affected by the 2015/16 El Nino event. 2015/16 El Nino soil water drought impacts affected 29% of the terrestrial tropics, compared to 16% and 18% in 1982/83 and 1997/98, respectively. Maximum temperatures were particularly exacerbated compared to previous strong El Nifios because they were amplified by the warming trend due to anthropogenic climate change. This also intensified positive anomalies of atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (the atmospheric demand for moisture), which had strongly negative consequences for vegetation productivity in the tropics. Even if El Nino events do not increase in intensity over coming decades, the pervasive long-term warming trend means that the atmospheric drought impact of each strong El Nino is becoming more severe, and many parts of the tropics will experience novel climate (temperature and VPD) conditions with each new strong El Nino event.

Here, we investigated the effects of seven intercropping systems [alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)/cucumber, trifolium (Trifolium repens L.)/cucumber, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/cucumber, rye (Secale cereale L.)/cucumber, chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronrium L.)/cucumber, rape (Brassica campestris L.)/cucumber, mustard (Brassica juncea L.)/cucumber] on soil bacterial and fungal communities compared to the cucumber continuous cropping system in the greenhouse. The results showed that intercropping increased microbial OTU richness and fungal communities diversity, soil bacterial communities diversity was abundant in the trifolium-cucumber and mustard-cucumber systems. Nevertheless, there was no significant differences of microbial communities structure between intercropping and monoculture systems. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil microbial communities composition was indirectly influenced by soil properties. In addition, network analysis demonstrated that simple inter-relationships of fungal taxa were observed in the intercropping soil, and trifolium, wheat, and mustard intercropping systems had a complex connection between bacterial taxa. Taken together, trifolium and mustard as the intercrops significantly increased cucumber continuous cropping soil bacterial and fungal communities diversity. Moreover, intercropping strongly changed the relationships of microbial taxa, though did not shape notably soil microbial communities structure.

Source and flux of POC in two subtropical karstic tributaries with contrasting land use practice in the Yangtze River Basin	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							PARTICULATE ORGANIC-CARBON; INORGANIC CARBON; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; ISOTOPE RATIOS; TRANSPORT; MATTER; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; VARIABILITY; NITROGEN; ESTUARY	Elemental (C/N ratio) and C isotope composition (delta C-13) of particulate organic C (POC) and organic C content (OC) of total suspended solids (TSS) were determined for two subtropical karstic tributaries of the Yangtze River, the Wujiang (the eighth largest tributary) and Yuanjiang (the third largest tributary). For the latter, two headwaters, the karstic Wuyanghe and non-karstic Qingshuijiang were studied. The Wujiang catchment is subject to intensive land use, has low forest coverage and high soil erosion rate. The delta C-13 of POC covered a range from -30.6 parts per thousand to -24.9 parts per thousand, from -27.6 parts per thousand to -24.7 parts per thousand and from -26.2 parts per thousand to -23.3 parts per thousand at the low-water stage, while at the high-water stage varied in a span between -28.6 parts per thousand and -24.4 parts per thousand between -27.7 parts per thousand and -24.5 parts per thousand and between -27.6 parts per thousand. and -24.2 parts per thousand for the Wujiang, Wuyanghe, and Qingshuijiang, respectively. The combined application of C isotopes, C/N ratio, OC, and TSS analyses indicated that catchment soil was the predominant source of POC for the Wujiang while for the Wuyanghe and Qingshuijiang, in-stream processes supplied the main part of POC in winter and summer. A significant increase in delta C-13 value (1.4 parts per thousand) of POC was found in the Wujiang during summer, and was attributed to the enhanced soil erosion of the dry arable uplands close to the riverbanks of the main channel. Based on a conservative estimate, POC fluxes were 3.123 x 10(10), 0.084 x 10(10), and 0.372 x 10(10) g a(-1) while export rates of POC were 466, 129, and 218 mg m(-2) a(-1) for the Wujiang, Wuyanghe, and Qingshuijiang, respectively. The POC export rate for the karstic Wujiang, with intensive land use, was 2-3 higher than that of the karstic Wuyanghe or of the non-karstic Qingshuijiang where soil erosion was minor. Such high values imply rapid degradation of related karstic ecosystems impacted by intensive land use activities, and pose a potential threat to the health of the Three Gorges Reservoir.

However, the role of functionality in tuning the AHP performance has not been elucidated. In this work, the ethanol adsorption behaviors and AHP performance of Zr-based MOFs in three topologies (i.e. csq, ftw and scu) functionalized by -NH2 and -CF3 exhibiting different affinities towards ethanol working fluid were investigated by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC). It was revealed that functionalization not only affected the adsorption capacity but also shifted the steps of isotherms to the low pressure upon functionalization by -NH2. scu-MOFs exhibited the higher coefficient of performance for cooling (COPC) than csq-MOFs and ftw-MOFs. Moreover, functionalization reduced the COPC of ftw-MOFs and scu-MOFs due to the lower working capacity resulting from the reduced pore volumes. On the contrary, the COPC of csq-MOFs can be improved upon functionalization by -NH2. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the uniform experimental design method is used to prepare lamellar material filled epoxy modified vinyl silicone rubber (EMVSR) flexible ablation resistant composite materials. The effects of three layered materials (lamella sericite, MoS2, and GO) on the ablation performance and thermal insulation performance of EMVSR materials under cyclic ablation conditions are discussed. In addition, the compressive strength of the composites after ablation and the density of the char layer are tested and analyzed. The test results show that all these sheet materials can enhance the heat resistance and thermal conductivity of the EMVSR composites and GO has the greatest impact. The back-face temperature of the EMVSR composites after the second ablation is higher than that after the first ablation, and GO can significantly improve the material's heat insulation performance under cyclic ablation conditions. The mass ablation rate of the EMVSR composites after the second ablation is generally greater than that after the first ablation.

The compressive strength of the char layer and the ablative resistance of the materials are positively correlated with the density of char layer.

Here, by using state-of-the-art density-functional theory calculations, we find that Mn atoms decorated silicene has an anomalously fixed magnetic moment and a high Curie temperature. In addition, a tunable magnetic exchange coupling is achieved for Mn-silicene system with the application of biaxial strain, which induces a transformation from the ferromagnetic (FM) to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. As such, an atomic "bit" could be obtained by superimposing strain field once the FM and AFM states are referred to as "1" and "0". Such piezospin nanodevices, which convert mechanical energy into magnetic moment, would offer great potential for future information transmission, as they ultimately combine small size, high-speed operation, and low-power consumption.

However, critical drawbacks such as low energy density and poor stability are hindering their development and application. In this work, a stable symmetric sodium ion cell using sodium vanadium pyrophosphate Na6.88V2.81(P2O7)4 as the positive and negative electrodes is fabricated. Since the bipolar Na6.88V2.81(P2O7)4 possesses high sodium-ion diffusion ability and stable structure framework, it demonstrates promising rate capability and cycling performance as both the positive and negative electrodes. The symmetric sodium ion cell, with Na6.88V2.81(P2O7)4 as the active material in both the positive and negative electrodes, exhibits a high operating voltage plateau of approximate to 3.0 V, distinct rate capability (e.g. 45 mAh g-1 at 10 C) and excellent cycling performance (e.g. 71.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2 C). The results of this work represent a step toward the development of symmetric sodium ion batteries with high operating voltage, good rate capability and long lifespan.

The capillary inner surface was functionalized with dopamine by self-polymerization under alkaline conditions and the subsequent introduction of gold nanoparticles based on the electrostatic interaction and affinity between gold nanoparticles and amine groups on polydopamine. Then, thiol -cyclodextrin was introduced on the gold nanoparticle layer through S-Au covalent bonding. The preparation conditions including dopamine concentration, the number of coating layers of gold nanoparticles and thiol -cyclodextrin concentration were optimized to obtain satisfactory enantioselectivity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis spectroscopy (EDS) and EOF experiments were carried out to characterize the prepared open tubular (OT) column. Then, the separation effectiveness of the open tubular column was verified by the separation of seven chiral drugs including tryptophan, phenylalanine, histidine, fexofenadine, promethazine, tropicamide and terbutaline, and satisfactory separation results were obtained for the analytes studied. Moreover, the stability and repeatability of the column were studied through intra-day, inter-day and column-to-column investigations.

It was found that, in addition to the predominant mechanism of cleavage fracture in the cementite plates, ductile fracture of the cementite plates is another crack nucleation mechanism. The process of failure in the fully lamellar microstructure studied in the present investigation consists of four stages: dislocation pile-ups; single crack nucleation; distribution of crack nucleation; and crack growth, followed by final fracture. Through this study, a description of the lamellar microstructure fracture mechanism has been developed for numerical simulation in future studies.

Compared with previous shorter wavelength (violet-visible) light-induced PEC reaction, the anticipated near infrared (NIR, >-700 nm) excited PEC biosensor with multiple fascinating features should be more suitable for clinical diagnostic biology. Herein, we report an ingenious NIR-PEC biosensor by loading alloyed Au5Pt9 nanoframes on two dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets. The obtained hBN/Au5Pt9 nanoframes exhibit a remarkable higher NIR-PEC activity in comparison with other as-prepared hBN/AuPt references. The improved PEC performance is attributed to the enhanced synergetic coupling effect between Au5Pt9 nanoalloys and constitutionally stable h-BN that gives rise to a stronger absorbance capacity and pronounced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in visible-NIR region as well as high free-electron mobility of framework-like Au/Pt. Interestingly, the obtained h-BN/Au5Pt9 nanoframes excited by 808 nm NIR light provide superior PEC accuracy and sensitivity as compared to visible or other NIR light irradiation. Then, the novel 808 nm NIR-PEC biosensor was used for precise glucose monitoring in human tears with a detectable concentration of 0.03-100 mu M and a low detection limit of 0.406 nM. Undoubtedly, the proposed hBN/Au5Pt9 nanoframes as an appealing NIR-PEC glucose biosensor can possess greater potential values for practical glucose monitoring in biomedicine.

In this method, the immiscible three-phase flow is modeled through a multiple-relaxation-time color-gradient model, which not only allows for a full range of interfacial tensions but also produces stable outcomes for a wide range of viscosity ratios. A characteristic line model is introduced to implement the wetting boundary condition, which is not only easy to implement but is also able to handle arbitrarily complex boundaries with prescribed contact angles. The developed method is first validated by the simulation of a Janus droplet resting on a flat surface, a perfect Janus droplet deposited on a cylinder, and the capillary intrusion of ternary fluids for various viscosity ratios. It is then used to study a compound droplet subject to a uniform incoming flow passing through a multipillar structure, where three different values of surface wettability are considered. The simulated results show that the surface wettability has significant impact on the droplet dynamic behavior and final fluid distribution.

Confronted with severe water shortage, it is imperative to understand its comprehensive impact on water resource. Recently remarkable advances of life cycle assessment and water footprint analysis have been witnessed in this field. Based on a review of the two methods' history, we propose a combination evaluation framework and define an associated indicators set to integrate both methods' advantages. By methods integration, direct and indirect water use are combined with the green, blue, and gray water footprint to describe the water use in detail. Furthermore, the life cycle water footprint of a typical biomass direct-combustion power generation system in China is evaluated based on the combined method. Results show the system life cycle water use is 11.71 L/MJ, while agricultural plantation accounts for the major part (84.61%). In addition, direct green water footprint is the largest component (46.54%), while direct and indirect blue water footprints account for 36.59% and 1.74%, respectively; indirect gray water footprint is 1.771 L/MJ. In terms of water use intensity, the direct-combustion power generation is lower than bio-oil power generation, but far more than solar photovoltaic and wind power. Sensitivity analysis suggests that improving power generation efficiency, straw collection coefficient and cultivating high water-efficient crops can evidently contribute to alleviating water stress conditions for bioenergy production.

J	Guo, B; Li, ML; Li, S				Guo, Bo; Li, Meiling; Li, Sai			The comparative study of a homogeneous and a heterogeneous system with green synthesized iron nanoparticles for removal of Cr(VI)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ZERO-VALENT IRON; FENTON-LIKE CATALYST; COEXISTING ANIONS; GRAPHENE OXIDE; CHROMIUM VI; ADSORPTION; DEGRADATION; REDUCTION; TRANSFORMATION; TEMPERATURE	Green iron nanoparticles (G-nZVI) were synthesized in situ by adding grape-seed extracts and Fe2+ solution simultaneously. The performances for the removal of Cr(VI) were compared in a homogeneous system by original G-nZVI (in suspension) with in a heterogeneous system by treated G-nZVI. The characterization of TEM, SEM, XRD, FTIR and XPS show that G-nZVI is the formation of Fe degrees-iron oxide core-shell nanoparticles with organic matters in the extracts as capping/stabilizing agents. The same excellent performances on the removal of Cr(VI) were observed in the both systems and the adsorption capacity was from 78.3 to 166.7mg (Cr)g(-1) (Fe) with the increase of initial Fe2+ concentrations. The pseudo second-order model described the adsorption process excellently and both pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order models fit the reduction process well. It illustrated that the reaction included prompt adsorption and simultaneous redox process. Moreover, the results of thermodynamics study (Delta G degrees<0, Delta H degrees>0, Delta S degrees>0) revealed that the adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process. It is obvious that the systhesis of original G-nZVI in the homogeneous system is more simple, rapid, cost-effective and suitable for in situ uses. It holds a great potential for remediation of soil and water.

Our results show that the current-voltage curve displays a negative differential resistance phenomenon in a certain bias voltage range. The mechanism for the negative differential resistance phenomenon is suggested. The present findings could be helpful for the application of the C-121 molecule in the field of single molecular devices or nanometer electronics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The free energy diagrams for the associative mechanism are given to identify the rate-determining step for the ORR on the chosen surfaces. The calculation results show that the first electron transfer is the rate-determining step for the ORR on the ((1) over bar 11) and ((1) over bar 01) surfaces, whereas the last electron transfer is the rate-limiting step for the ORR on the (110) surface. Furthermore, the d-electron partial density of state for the active zirconium atoms is calculated to explore the relationship between the ORR catalytic activity of the chosen surface and their electronic properties. The calculated results indicate that the catalytic activity for the ORR on the chosen surfaces is closely related with the d-orbital occupation of their active zirconium atoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Studies on thermal shock resistance of TiN and TiAlN coatings under pulsed laser irradiation	SURFACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Nitride coatings; Thermal shock; Laser irradiation	CARBON C/C COMPOSITE; MACHINING PERFORMANCE; WEAR MECHANISMS; COATED TOOLS; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; NITRIDE; DEPOSITION; OXIDATION	TiN and TiAlN nitride coatings were deposited on WC/Co cemented carbide by cathode arc evaporation technique. The microstructural and fundamental properties of these nitride coatings were examined. Thermal shock tests were carried out on these nitride coatings by laser irradiation, and thermal shock behaviours were examined by scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that the major factors causing failure of these nitride coatings after laser irradiation were thermal stress and oxidation. The formation of cracks on the irradiated coating surface is attributed to the shrinkage and relaxation of thermal stresses during laser irradiation. The critical power density at which the coating is fractured is 20 x 10(8) W m(-2) for the TiN coating and 45 x 10(8) W m(-2) for the TiAlN coating. The coatings with Al (TiAlN) exhibited higher thermal shock resistance over the one without Al (TiN). Analysis of the repeated laser irradiated coating surfaces demonstrated that the TiN coating was composed mainly of crack networks, spallation and bulges, whereas the TiAlN coating experienced less damage than the TiN coating and showed a lot of cavities on the coating surface.

J	Jarvis, A; Li, S				Jarvis, Andrew; Li, Sile			The contribution of timescales to the temperature response of climate models	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Climate sensitivity; Equilibrium; Ocean circulation; Global energy balance; Timescale; Gain	OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE MODEL; CARBON-DIOXIDE; TIME SCALES; TRANSIENT-RESPONSES; SENSITIVITY; CO2; EQUILIBRIUM; SIMULATIONS; CIRCULATION; STORAGE	Both the magnitude and timescale of climate change in response to anthropogenic forcing are important consideration in climate change decision making. Using a familiar, yet simple global energy balance model combined with a novel method for estimating the amount of gain in the global surface temperature response to radiative forcing associated with timescales in the range 10(0)-10(3) years we show that the introduction of large-scale circulation such as meridional overturning leads to the emergence of discrete gain-timescale relationships in the dynamics of this model. This same feature is found in the response of both an intermediate complexity and two atmosphere-ocean general circulation models run to equilibrium. As a result of this emergent property of climate models, it is possible to offer credible partitioning of the full equilibrium gain of these models, and hence their equilibrium climate sensitivity, between two discrete timescales; one decadal associated with near surface ocean heat equilibration; and one centennial associated with deep ocean heat equilibration. Timescales of approximately 20 and 700 years with a 60:40 partitioning of the equilibrium gain are found for the models analysed here. A re-analysis of the emulation results of 19 AOGCMs presented by Meinshausen et al. (Atmos Chem Phys Discuss 8:6153-6272, 2008) indicates timescales of 20 and 580 years with an approximate 50:50 partition of the equilibrium gain between the two. This suggests near equal importance of both short and long timescales in determining equilibrium climate sensitivity.

The key driving force is the complementary length scale between biological structures that range from the 10's of nanometers (proteins, DNA, viruses) to the micron scale (cells and cellular assemblies) and capabilities of nanosystems to manipulate and control such feature sizes within our environment. Progress and development in biosensor development will inevitably focus upon the technology of the nanomaterials that promise to solve the biocompatibility and biofouling problems. The biosensors are integrated with new technologies in molecular biology, micro-fluidics, and smart nanomaterials, have applications in agricultural production, food processing, and environmental monitoring for rapid, specific, sensitive, inexpensive, in-field, on-line and/or real-time detection of pesticides, antibiotics, pathogens, toxins, proteins, microbes, plants, animals, foods, soil, air, and water. Thus, biosensors are excellent analytical tools for pollution monitoring, by which implementation of legislative provisions to safeguard our biosphere could be made effectively plausible. The current trends and challenges with smart nanomaterials for various applications have been the focuse in this chapter that pertains to biosensor development, bionanoelectronics, nanotechnology, biotechnology and miniaturization. All these growing areas will have a remarkable influence on the development of new ultra biosensing devices to resolve the severe pollution problems in the future that not only challenge the human health but also affect adversely other various comforts to living entities.

Enrichments of up to 13% for S-33 are attributed to a magnetic isotope effect (MIE) associated with the formation of thiol-disulfide, ion-radical pairs. Observed S-36 depletions in products are explained here by classical (mass-dependent) isotope effects and mixing processes. The experimental data contrasts strongly with multiple sulfur isotope trends in Archean samples, which exhibit significant S-36 anomalies. These results support an origin other than thermochemical sulfate reduction for the mass-independent signals observed for early Earth samples.

The results showed when inoculated with IRB, labile C as a pulsed input significantly improved the mycorrhiza colonization and hyphal length density, and increased the shoot P content, microbial biomass C and glomalin content at P5 rate; meanwhile, the labile C input also promoted the Fe(II) production, when inoculated with IRB, labile C as a pulsed input increased the C/A extractable Fe(II), oxalate-extractable P and microbial biomass P content. These facts suggested that application of labile C as a pulsed input enhanced the ability of IRB in improving the Fe reduction and Fe-P utilization in subtropical soil.

While quantification of stable species can be achieved within 30% uncertainty, the measured mole fractions of reactive intermediates often have large systematic errors, mainly due to the large uncertainties associated with estimated photoionization cross sections. These measurements are therefore less effective in improving the model accuracy, and it remains a challenge to make full use of those data for important reactive intermediates with relatively large uncertainties. In the present work, we propose a model-assisted calibration method to reduce the uncertainty of the measurements for those reactive species in the MBMS experiments. The method takes advantage of the inherent correlation of the systematic uncertainty in the MBMS measurements and uses the accurate model predictions to calibrate the correlated experimental data. By global uncertainty analysis, the kinetic model for the methanol/O 2 flame was analyzed to select the optimal experimental conditions for which the model prediction of the hydroxymethyl radical (CH 2 OH) has the smallest uncertainty. Then the correlation factor for the systematic uncertainty is determined by analyzing the new measurement and the model prediction under the designed condition. The correlation factor determined has been successfully used to calibrate the peak mole fraction of the CH 2 OH radical in a laminar premixed methanol flame, reported earlier.

Monodisperse water-soluble gamma-Fe2O3/polyvinylpyrrolidone nanoparticles for a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent	MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS			English	Article						Superparamagnetism; Nanoparticles; Magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent	CARBON NANOTUBES	Water-soluble gamma-Fe2O3/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanoparticles were obtained by transferring oleic acid (OA) coated iron-oxide nanocrystals from hexane to water. The particle size of the gamma-Fe2O3/PVP nanoparticles with excellent monodispersity is about 14 nm. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that PVP anchors on the gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles through its carbonyl group and provided sufficient hydrophilicity. The maghemite content in the gamma-Fe2O3/PVP nanoparticles was about 81 wt-%. The saturation magnetisation of the superparamagnetic gamma-Fe2O3/PVP nanoparticles is 57.7 emu g(-1) at 295 K. For in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, the gamma-Fe2O3/PVP nanoparticles can be guided to the target area by a permanent magnet and show negative contrast enhancement on the target area of laboratory mice.

In situ synthesis of PBO-alpha-(amino phthalocyanine copper) composite fiber with excellent UV-resistance and tensile strength	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						copolymerization; mechanical properties; organic fiber	P-PHENYLENEBENZOBISOXAZOLE FIBERS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE FIBERS; PBO FIBERS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; AGING-RESISTANCE; GRAPHENE OXIDE; NANOCOMPOSITE; PHOTOSTABILITY; POLYMERIZATION; NANOPARTICLES	The anti-ultraviolet (UV) aging of the poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) is very important and has been paid much attention recently. In this study, copolymerization of PBO and alpha-amino phthalocyanine copper (alpha-TDMACuPc) was carried out by in situ polymerization and the fiber was obtained by dry-jet wet spinning in the liquid crystal state. Inducing of alpha-TDMACuPc into PBO macromolecules improve the molecular network and enhanced the tensile strength of PBO fiber. With the capability of absorbing UV light into the PBO molecular chain, PBO copolymer fibers showed excellent anti-UV aging performance and changed with the block structure. It is found that the retention of tensile strength after 100 h of UV irradiation was improved from 66.44% of PBO to 88.80% of PBO-2.0 wt % alpha-TDMACuPc fiber. Meanwhile, the degree of UV etching of the fibers decreased with the addition of alpha-TDMACuPc. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2018, 135, 46870.

Rapid determination of soil classes in soil profiles using vis-NIR spectroscopy and multiple objectives mixed support vector classification	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Pedometrics Conference	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2017	Wageningen, NETHERLANDS				SPECTRAL LIBRARY; ORGANIC-MATTER; PREDICTION; CARBON; PEDOLOGY; CHINA	Visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy can reveal various soil properties and facilitate soil classification. However, few studies have attempted to classify vertical soil profiles that contain several genetic horizons. Here, we propose the 'multiple objectives mixed support vector classification' (MOM-SVC) method to classify soil profiles. A total of 130 soil profiles were collected from genetic horizons in Zhejiang Province, China. After laboratory analysis, soil profiles were classified according to the Chinese Soil Taxonomy system. Vis-NIR spectra were recorded from each genetic horizon of each soil profile and were then pre-processed. We performed the MOM-SVC method as follows: (i) created a support vector machine (SVM) model (one-versus-one approach) using spectral data from all soil horizons in calibration profiles, (ii) applied the SVM model on each horizon of the profile to be predicted, (iii) extracted 'votes' from each horizon and mixed (or summarized) them into the votes of each profile to be predicted and (iv) classified each profile by the majority-voting method. We also investigated whether the additional input of auxiliary soil information (e.g. moist soil colour, soil organic matter and soil texture), which could be measured easily or be well predicted by vis-NIR spectroscopy, could improve the accuracy of soil classification when combined with it. Independent validation results showed that the MOM-SVC method performed better at the soil order level than at the suborder level. Adding auxiliary soil information to the classification model improved the overall accuracy of classification at the soil order level. The proposed MOM-SVC method provides a fast objective diagnostic of soil classes for use in soil surveys and can help to update soil databases when a more objective soil classification system is developed.

Optical reflectance techniques can prove to be very powerful techniques to study some of the thickness dependent physical properties, e.g. A and B excitonic peaks. Here, we measured reflection spectra of MoS(2 )flakes on SiO2/Si substrate in the broad wavelength range of 400-800 mn and studied the emission wavelength of A and B excitons as a function of the layer number. Moreover, we calculated the optimized SiO2 thickness to avoid the substrate-related interference effect influencing the investigation of exciton properties.

A thin film of polydopamine (PDA) was deposited on a gold chip modified with hollow gold nanoparticles (HGNPs) via self-polymerization of DA, and this allows for the direct immobilization of anti-cTropI. cTropI and anti-cTropI (as the secondary antibody) were sequentially introduced to the system to form a sandwich structure on the surface of the sensor. The HGNPs are found to strongly enhance the SPR signal, and the PDA layer acts as a viable support for immobilization of the antibody compared to that of conventional 3-mercaptopropinic acid (MPA) and does not require chemical activation. The PDA film also protects the HGNPs from agglomeration. The enhancement in the SPR signal is found to be proportional to the concentration of cTropI in the range from 1.25 to 40 mu g mL(-1). The detection limit is 38 ng mL(-1), which is 67 times lower than that of an SPR biosensor based on the use of gold-MPA. The assay was applied to the determination of cTropI spiked in serum samples, and the recoveries were satisfactory.

J	Li, S; Jarvis, A				Li, Sile; Jarvis, Andrew			Long run surface temperature dynamics of an A-OGCM: the HadCM3 4xCO(2) forcing experiment revisited	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Transfer function; Global energy balance; Radiative forcing CO2	GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON-CYCLE; UNSTEADY AERODYNAMICS; TIME SCALES; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; CO2; ATMOSPHERE; IDENTIFICATION	The global mean surface temperature (GMST) response of HadCM3 to a 1,000 year 4xCO(2) forcing is analysed using a transfer function methodology. We identify a third order transfer function as being an appropriate characterisation of the dynamic relationship between the radiative forcing input and GMST output of this Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (A-OGCM). From this transfer function the equilibrium climate sensitivity is estimated as 4.62 (3.92-11.88) K which is significantly higher than previously estimated for HadCM3. The response is also characterised by time constants of 4.5 (3.2-6.4), 140 (78-191) and 1,476 (564-11,737) years. The fact that the longest time constant element is significantly longer than the 1,000 year simulation run makes estimation of this element of the response problematic, highlighting the need for significantly longer model runs to express A-OGCM behaviour fully. The transfer function is interpreted in relation to a three box global energy balance model. It was found that this interpretation gave rise to three fractions of ocean heat capacity with effective depths of 63.0 (46.7-85.4), 1291.7 (787.3-2,955.3) and 2,358.0 (661.3-17,283.8) meters of seawater, associated with three discrete time constants of 4.6 (3.2-6.5), 107.7 (68.9-144.3) and 537.1 (196.2-1,243.1) years. Given this accounts for approximately 94% of the ocean heat capacity in HadCM3, it appears HadCM3 could be significantly more well mixed than previously thought when viewed on the millennial timescale.

J	Li, S; Wang, CY; Nithiarasu, P				Li, Si; Wang, Chengyuan; Nithiarasu, Perumal			Three-dimensional transverse vibration of microtubules	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PROTEIN MICROTUBULES; CARBON; BEHAVIORS; DYNAMICS; RIGIDITY; LATTICE; MODEL	A three-dimensional (3D) transverse vibration was reported based on the molecular structural mechanics model for microtubules (MTs), where the bending axis of the cross section rotates in an anticlockwise direction and the adjacent half-waves oscillate in different planes. Herein, efforts were invested to capturing the physics behind the observed phenomenon and identifying the important factors that influence the rotation angle between two adjacent half waves. A close correlation was confirmed between the rotation of the oscillation planes and the helical structures of the MTs, showing that the 3D mode is a result of the helicity found in the MTs. Subsequently, the wave length-dependence and the boundary condition effects were also investigated for the 3D transverse vibration of the MTs. In addition, the vibration frequency was found to remain the same in the presence or absence of the bending axis rotation. This infers that the unique vibration mode is merely due to the bending axis rotation of the cross section, but no significant torsion occurs for the MTs. Published by AIP Publishing.

They exhibit a very high surface to volume ratio as well as unique magnetic and electrical properties which make them ideal candidates for new and innovative sensing devices. One of the key aspects in new biosensor developments is the alignment of monodimensional nanostructures that can be obtained by employing Langmuir Blodgett techniques as well as electrical and magnetic external fields. There recently have been many successful applications of 1D nanostructures in high performance sensors, such as field biomedical sensors that are able to detect very low concentrations of DNA and novel gas sensors for the detection of ultra-low concentration of toxic gases. The well-improved sensors employing 1D-nanostructures have a profound impact on healthcare and safety, thereby playing a more and more important role in the near future.

Peroxidasin Deficiency Re-programs Macrophages Toward Pro-fibrolysis Function and Promotes Collagen Resolution in Liver	CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY			English	Article						Fibrosis; Liver; Macrophages; Peroxidasin	HEPATIC STELLATE CELLS; MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE-13; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; BASEMENT-MEMBRANE; HYPOHALOUS ACIDS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; BONE-MARROW; FIBROSIS; INFLAMMATION; CIRRHOSIS	Peroxidasin deficiency results in mild-hypoxic liver micro-environment and causes recruitment of monocytes and pro-fibrolysis macrophages in early stages of liverfibrosis. Theseevents accelerate the resolution offibrosis and organhealing. BACKGROUND & AIMS: During liver fibrosis, tissue repair mechanisms replace necrotic tissue with highly stabilized extracellular matrix proteins. Extracellular matrix stabilization influences the speed of tissue recovery. Here, we studied the expression and function of peroxidasin (PXDN), a peroxidase that uses hydrogen peroxide to cross-link collagen IV during liver fibrosis progression and regression. METHODS: Mouse models of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis patients were analyzed for the expression of PXDN in liver and serum. Pxdn(-/-)and Pxdn(+ /+) mice were either treated with carbon tetrachloride for 6 weeks to generate toxin-induced fibrosis or fed with a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet for 16 weeks to create nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis. Liver histology, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, collagen content, flowcytometry and immunostaining of immune cells, RNA-sequencing, and liver function tests were analyzed. In vivo imaging of liver reactive oxygen species (ROS) was performed using a redox-active iron complex, Fe-PyC3A. RESULTS: In human and mouse cirrhotic tissue, PXDN is expressed by stellate cells and is secreted into fibrotic areas. In patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, serum levels of PXDN increased significantly. In both mouse models of liver fibrosis, PXDN deficiency resulted in elevated monocyte and pro-fibrolysis macrophage recruitment into fibrotic bands and caused decreased accumulation of cross-linked collagens. In Pxdn(-/-)mice, collagen fibers were loosely organized, an atypical phenotype that is reversible upon macrophage depletion. Elevated ROS in Pxdn(-/-) livers was observed, which can result in activation of hypoxic signaling cascades and may affect signaling pathways involved in macrophage polarization such as TNF-alpha via NF-kB. Fibrosis resolution in Pxdn(-/-)mice was associated with significant decrease in collagen content and improved liver function. CONCLUSION: PXDN deficiency is associated with increased ROS levels and a hypoxic liver microenvironment that can regulate recruitment and programming of pro-resolution macrophages. Our data implicate the importance of the liver microenvironment in macrophage programming during liver fibrosis and suggest a novel pathway that is involved in the resolution of scar tissue.

A portable, low-cost relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system for quantifying ecosystem-level fluxes of volatile organics	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Relaxed eddy accumulation (REA); Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs); Emission flux; Isoprene; Monoterpenes	TOF-MS MEASUREMENTS; RAIN-FOREST; COVARIANCE MEASUREMENTS; MONOTERPENE FLUXES; ISOPRENE EMISSIONS; BVOC EMISSIONS; DRY SEASON; TENAX-TA; MODEL; AEROSOLS	Quantification of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) fluxes into the atmosphere is crucial to understand their role in atmospheric oxidation and biogeochemical cycles. BVOC flux measurements were carried out in nine forest ecosystems using a relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) based sampling system, which is easily transportable, simple to operate and designed to be low-cost and therefore can easily be deployed at multiple remote locations. The REA measurements were carried out during daytime between 06:00 and 18:30 (Local Time) with a flux averaging period of 30 min. A detailed description of the REA sampling setup, operational procedure and validation by comparison with full eddy covariance (EC) BVOC flux measurements is provided. BVOC flux measurements from established long-term carbon and water flux tower sites in nine forest ecosystems are compared including Manitou Forest Observatory in Colorado, USA (pine woodland forest), Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux site in Colorado, USA (subalpine forest), Deer Canyon Preserve in New Mexico, USA (pinyon-juniper forest), Lei bamboo forest site near Taihuyuan, China, Qianyanzhou ChinaFLUX site in China (pine forest), Baskett Wildfire Refuge MOFlux site in Missouri, USA (deciduous oak forest), University of Michigan Biological Station PROPHET site in Michigan, USA (mixed deciduous forest), Changbai Mountain Forest Research Station in China (mixed deciduous forest) and the Guyaflux site (GF-Guy) in French Guiana (tropical rainforest). BVOC flux measurements using our REA setup confirm dominance of 2,3,2- methylbutenol (2,3,2-MBO) at the Manitou Forest Observatory and Niwot Ridge sites in Colorado. Monoterpene fluxes measured by REA showed good agreement (within +/- 10%) with monoterpene fluxes measured by PTR-MS at the Manitou Forest Observatory. The MOFlux site in Missouri was dominated by isoprene emissions (average flux of similar to 9.5 mg m(-2) h(-1)) whereas the Deer Canyon site was dominated by alpha-pinene emissions (average flux similar to 0.73 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Mixed deciduous forest sites at the PROPHET Station in Michigan and Changbai Mountain Forest Research Station in China primarily emitted isoprene along with some alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and d-Limonene. Isoprene and alpha-pinene were the dominant BVOCs emitted from the subtropical Lei bamboo plantation at the Taihuyuan site in China while the pine forest site at Qianyanzhou in China were dominated by alpha-pinene emissions along with significant isoprene. BVOC measurements across different seasons (during 2009-2011) at a tropical forest site in French Guiana (Guyaflux site) revealed the dominance of isoprene emissions during all seasons. Irrespective of the type of the forest ecosystem, alpha-pinene was among the dominant monoterpenes emitted from all nine forests.

Here, we discuss the mechanisms of CO oxidation to CO2 over single Ag atoms supported on hexagonal boron-nitride sheets (Ag-1/BN) through systematic van der Waals inclusive density functional theory (DFT-D) calculations. The Ag adatom can be anchored onto a boron defect (V-B), as suggested by the large energy barrier of 3.12 eV for Ag diffusion away from the V-B site. Three possible mechanisms (i.e., Eley-Rideal, Langmuir-Hinshelwood, and termolecular Eley-Rideal) of CO oxidation over Ag-1/BN are investigated. Due to "CO-Promoted O-2 Activation'', the termolecular Eley-Rideal (TER) mechanism is the most relevant one for CO oxidation over Ag-1/BN and the rate-limiting reaction barrier is only 0.33 eV. More importantly, the first principles molecular dynamics simulations confirm that CO oxidation via the TER mechanism may easily occur at room temperature. Analyses with the inclusion of temperature and entropy effects further indicate that the CO oxidation via the TER mechanism over Ag-1/BN is thermodynamically favorable in a broad range of temperatures.

In this work, ultrathin CuGaO2 nanosheets with highly exposed single-interlayered Cu edges are synthesized via an induced anisotropic growth strategy. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the exposed single-interlayered Cu(I) edges on the (001) surface of CuGaO2 present a high-density of single-atomic Cu sites, which feature excellent CO2 electroreduction catalytic activity toward CH4. The CuGaO2 nanosheet catalysts exhibit efficient and stable CO2-to-CH4 electroreduction with Faradaic efficiency (FECH4) of 71.7% at a high current density of -1 A cm(-2), corresponding to a superior CH4 partial current density of 717 +/- 33 mA cm(-2). This work suggests an attractive design strategy for tuning both the crystal facets and Cu-Cu distance to promote the CH4 electrosynthesis at high-current-density CO2 reduction.

The current study explores the influence of soluble polysulfides (PS) and lithium nitrate (LiNO3) on the characteristics of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, formed spontaneously on the Li surface, prior to electrochemical cycling. Special attention is paid to the evolution of the electrochemical impedance and nanoscale morphology of the interface, influenced by the contact time and electrolyte composition. The basic tools applied in this investigation are electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) performed at the nanoscale, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The individual addition of polysulfides and LiNO3 increases the interface resistance, while the simultaneous application of these components is beneficial, reducing the SEI resistive behavior. The electrochemical cycling of Li in nonmodified 1,2-dimethoxy ethane (DME) and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) based electrolytes leads to slight morphological changes, compared to the pristine Li pattern. In contrast, we found that in the presence of PS and LiNO3, the interface displays a rough and inhomogeneous morphology.

The PANI-NF and MnO2 were obtained by in situ oxidation of aniline by potassium permanganate and in situ reduction of potassium permanganate by aniline, respectively. During the interfacial polymerization, the monomer aniline can only be oxidized to PANI after it diffuses into the water phase. This diffusion-control feeding process of the monomer results in nanofiber structure. The morphologies and crystal structures of the prepared PANI/MnO2 composites were measured by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. The supercapacitive behaviours of these composites were analysed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) tests. The CV and GCD tests indicate that the PANI/MnO2 composites possess better electrochemical activity and higher capacitive properties compared to neat PANI nanofibers. The specific capacitance of PANI/MnO2 composites and PANI-NF are 751 F g(-1) and 180 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) in Na2SO4 solution, respectively. We believe that the enhanced capacitive properties are related to the special nanostructure and strong interaction between PANI and MnO2 that resulted from the interfacial synthesis method.

The tribological tests were carried out on steel-steel contacts using a reciprocating ball-on-disk tribometer. Compared with white oil, an addition of 0.1 wt% h-BN/GF could reduce the friction coefficient, wear-rate and wear depth by 41.1%, 89.1%, and 92.3%, respectively. Furthermore, compared with 0.1 wt% h-BN and 0.1 wt% GF, 0.1 wt% h-BN/GF nanocomposite also showed the best lubrication and wear resistance performances. The synergistic lubrication mechanism of h-BN/GF nanocomposite was investigated, and the unique microstructure of the h-BN/GF composite and the weak interfacial interaction between h-BN and GF were found to be beneficial to the formation of continuous and adhesive tribo-films at the interface.

Roll-to-roll mechanical prelithiation (MP) is an attractive option for achieving prelithiation in minutes. While our previous work on metallic-foil prelithiation revealed that an external pressure is necessary to achieve MP in a timely fashion, too high an applied pressure will cause severe damages in the form of porosity and cracking. Thus, gentler MP under smaller pressure, and surprisingly, cryogenic temperatures, while prepositioning prolific grain boundaries as lithium diffusion paths is critical. To this end, first, we developed an accumulative roll bonding (ARB) method to refine the grain size of Sn-5Sb foil for denser grain boundaries. After ARB of 12 cycles (ARB-12), the grain size of Sn-5Sb foil decreased from 20-50 to 0.5-1.5 mu m. Then, MP was performed under a mild condition of 0.5 MPa and -20 degrees C. Thereby, the porosity of prelithiated ARB-12 was reduced to 1.8% from thickness measurement, significantly minimizing the prelithiation damage. As a result, due to grain refinement, we achieved lower interface impedance and better rate performance. The ARB-12 Sn-5Sb foil with a proper prelithiation design exhibited 180 and 110 stable cycles when pairing with commercial LFP and NCM811 cathodes. Furthermore, it also depletes less electrolyte and keeps higher capacity retention under -10 degrees C than that of the graphite anode.

It is found that tho lattice constant of MFe2O4-delta(delta>0) is larger than that of MFe2O4+delta, while its internal magnetic field is smaller than that of MFe2O4+delta. With increasing the deficiency degree delta, the lattice constant increased, and the internal magnetic field decreased. MFe2O4-delta is unstable in air at room temperature, but it can exist steadily in inert gas at low temperature (<673 K), MFe2O4-delta possesses very strong reducing power and can reduce CO2 to C at 573 K.

One of technical challenges in understanding its recovery mechanisms is how to release and produce dissolved oil from kerogen. Controlled by diffusion, this time-dependent process has not been considered in any commercial simulators. In this study, a finely-tuned non-equilibrium mass transfer model embedded in a commercial simulator is utilized to represent the diffusion process. In the field-scale model, 37.9% of original oil in place (OOIP) is stored in the kerogen as the dissolved phase. This study has an oil recovery factor of 6.3 OOIP% for a primary production case, and 8.9 OOIP % for another case starting with primary production and followed by CO2 huff-n-puff. The cases with dissolved oil produce 49% and 36% more oil, respectively, compared to the cases without dissolved oil. The simulation results suggest that 60.5% of the total injected CO2 is stored in the shale formations, among which 45.8% is dissolved in kerogen. CO2 dissolution is achieved by the counter-current diffusion in kerogen near wellbores and hydraulic fractures. This study pioneers incorporation of the time-dependent release of oil from kerogen into the field-scale simulation, and demonstrates that the kerogen provides recoverable dissolved oil and acts as a CO2 storage site.

Herein, sodium ions were intentionally introduced into the MoS2 to regulate its structure and thus HER activity. We found that the HER activity of MoS2 would gradually increase at the intercalation stage and further increase at the early stage of conversion reaction. Based on various characterization techniques, the possible structure-performance relationship was established. The first increase in activity was ascribed to interlayer expansion and phase transformation, and the second increase in activity was mainly ascribed to increase of active sites due to the fragmentation of MoS2 after triggering conversion reaction. Even though deep discharging MoS2 to 0.01 V (vs. Na+/Na) would slightly impair HER activity, such an activity was still much better than that of pristine MoS2, which might be originated from the doping of S into molybdenum oxide according to the DFT calculation.

Techniques, including open circuit potential-time, alternating current impedance, and linear sweep voltammetry, were applied to the bipolar plates to investigate their electrochemical properties through both single cell and fuel cell stack at 70-90 degrees C. The results indicated that the bipolar plates achieved stable and uniform performance. Specifically, the fuel cell stack composed of three single cells in series achieved a maximum current density of 79.78 mA/cm(2) and a peak power density of 25.54 mW/cm(2) at 80 degrees C. A good and cyclable performance of the fuel cell devices using the magnesia phosphate cement based bipolar plates was observed in the switch on/off test. Then, an operation of 3.5 h was achieved under a current density of 25 mA/cm(2) during the fuel availability test. The after-test investigation suggested that the surface reinforcement of the bipolar plates might improve the performance of long term operation. In conclusion, magnesia phosphate cement composite bipolar plates are suitable for direct methanol fuel cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, a two-column seven-step elevated temperature pressure swing system with high purification performance was proposed. The concept of reactive separation by adding water gas shift catalysts into the columns filled with elevated temperature CO2 adsorbents was adopted. The H-2 recovery ratio and H-2 purity were greatly improved by the introduction of steam rinse and steam purge, which could be realized due to the increasing operating temperature (200-450 degrees C). An optimized operating region to both achieve high efficiency and low energy consumption was proposed. The optimized case with 0.09 purge-to-feed ratio and 0.15 rinse-to-feed ratio could achieve 99.6% H-2 recovery ratio and 99.9991% H-2 purity at a stable state for a feed gas containing 1% CO, 1% CO2, 10% H2O, and 88% H-2, No performance degradation was observed for at least 1000 cycles. The proposed (ET-PSA) system possessed self-purification ability while the columns were penetrated by CO2. It is however suggested that periodical heat regeneration should be adopted to accelerate performance recovery during long-term operation. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

K. Gomes et al., Nature (London) 483, 306 (2012); S. Wang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 196803 (2014)] have illustrated that metal surface electrons can be manipulated to form a two-dimensional (2D) lattice by depositing a designer molecule lattice on a metal surface. This offers a promising new technique to construct artificial 2D electron lattices. Here we theoretically propose a molecule lattice pattern to realize an artificial Lieb lattice on a metal surface, which shows a flat electronic band due to the lattice geometry. We show that the localization of electrons in the flat band may be understood from the viewpoint of electron interference, which may be probed by measuring the local density of states with scanning tunneling microscopy. Our proposal may be readily implemented in experiment and may offer an ideal solid state platform to investigate the novel flat band physics of the Lieb lattice.

Nonsymmorphic nodal-line metals in the two-dimensional rare earth monochalcogenides MX (M = Sc, Y; X = S, Se, Te)	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							HIGH CARRIER MOBILITY; MONOLAYER; CHALCOGENIDES; SEMIMETAL; GRAPHENE; FERMIONS	We predict a new family of two-dimensional (2D) rare earth monochalcogenide materialsMX(M = Sc, Y;X = S, Se, Te). Based on first-principles calculations, we confirm their stability and systematically investigate their mechanical properties. We find that these materials are metallic and interestingly, they possess nodal lines in the low-energy band structure surrounding the whole Brillouin zone, protected by nonsymmorphic crystal symmetries in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). SOC opens small energy gaps at the nodal line, except for two high-symmetry points, at which fourfold degenerate 2D spin-orbit Dirac points are obtained. We show that these topological band features are robust under uniaxial and biaxial strains, but can be lifted by the shear strain. We also investigate the optical conductivities of these materials and show that the transformation of the band structure under strain can be inferred from the optical absorption spectrum. Our work reveals a new family of 2D topological metal materials with interesting mechanical and electronic properties, which will facilitate the study of nonsymmorphic symmetry enabled nodal features in 2D.

Compared with the GO-NM, the pGO-NM hybrids performed excellent catalysis on degradation of aqueous p-nitroaniline in surrounding air and aqueous medium with a mechanical agitation without light irradiations and additional hydrogen peroxides. These properties differed tremendously from those of most reported metallic oxide-GO hybrids. The catalytic decomposing of the p-nitroaniline was recorded by the successive measurements of an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer. The chemical modifications on GO were investigated with infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectrometers. The hybrids of GO-NM and pGO-NM are estimated with ultraviolet-visible spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry measurements and thermogravimetric analyses. The experimental results showed that the dissolved oxygen and water were involved in the degradation, which provided solid evidences for the mechanism discussion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Dehydrogenation using benzoquinone was not successful due to benzoquinone incorporation into the coal. The chief structure change on dehydrogenation with sulfur is loss of aliphatic hydrogen with a concomitant increase in coal aromaticity. Methyl hydrogen is lost. There is spectroscopic evidence for the formation of carboxyl which is contradicted by the fact that the equilibrium thermodynamics of their formation by the oxidizing agent sulfur is unfavorable. The rate of H2S formation drops sharply early in the reaction demonstrating that reactive hydrogen is selectively removed. Unfortunately, we could not determine whether the selectivity is due to high hydrogen chemical reactivity or easy hydrogen accessibility. Sulfur incorporation is low initially and increases as the reaction progresses. Dehydrogenation reduces the pyridine swelling of the coals.

The morphology and structure of the nanostructured Cu wires were characterized via scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy and Xray diffraction spectroscopy. The seamless surface nanostructure offered a large surface area and improved conductivity. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the seamless nanowires structure could electrochemically reduce nitrate due to the improved conductivity between the active sites and the substrate. A linear response to nitrate ions over a concentration range from 50 mu M to 600 mu M (R-2 = 0.9974) with a high sensitivity of 0.357 mu A mu M-1 cm(-1) and low detection limit of 12.2 mu M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, respectively, were obtained on the nanostructured copper wire.

Between the surface plasma and the thickness of the silver film, the length of the silver film, the thickness of silicon, and the position of silicon, these relationships will be studied in a rectangular cavity, which is surrounded by silver film, two rectangular nanoscale silicons, and silicon dioxide. The surface plasmon resonance of the RCM is independent of the distance between the two silicons when the transverse silver film length l is fixed and of height d = 10k (k = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) nm of rectangular silicon and thickness t (t = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 nm) of silver film while the length l = 600 nm. The SPR is a lateral length dependence of silver film. The plasma resonance of the two first-order modes is distributed symmetrically on both sides of the local field in RCM, and it is irrelevant with the position of the vibration mode and the thickness of the silver film. On the basis of the above research, we propose to create a guided-wave resonance that can be directly observed from the normal incidence transmission spectra and electric field distribution. This structure can be used as a highly tunable optical sensitive element that can be tuned with a small change of transverse silver film length.

One-dimensional (1D) nanofibers (NFs) and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets (NSs) are two kinds of fundamental building blocks for advanced nanocomposite materials. Electrospinning are one of the most versatile techniques for constructing 1D NFs-based nanocomposites that have attracted considerable attentions in the last two decades. Ultrathin 2D NSs have been recognized as considerable materials to couple with electrospun NFs by either in-situ growth or physical blending approach. In this paper, a comprehensive review is presented on the developments related to the sustainable applications of NSs coupled electrospun NFs nanocomposites. We introduce the heterogeneous functional nanocomposites applied for energy storage, catalysis, adsorption, separation, sensing and others including biomedical application and electromagnetic shielding. Summary and outlook concerning the future development of the synergistic engineering designed 1D-2D nanocomposites are also introduced briefly. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we model changes in seawater sulfate concentrations ([SO42-](sw)) during the SE by using paired S-isotope data of cogenetic sedimentary pyrite and carbonate-associated sulfate from the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation (South China), making independent calculations for inner-shelf and upper-slope sections. Our results show a significant increase of [SO42-](sw) toward the peak of the SE and a large proximal-to-distal gradient across the Yangtze Platform. Our findings provide direct evidence for transient oxidation of marine-shelf water masses during the SE, providing insights into Ediacaran oceanic oxygenation, the origin of the SE, and contemporaneous bioevolutionary events.

However, conventional wireless power transfer systems often suffer from unsatisfactory charging efficiency due to the comparatively longer recharge range and insufficient universality for various car models. Here, we present a stretchable wireless power transfer (SWPT) system that consists of thin and stretchable inductive coupling coils designed in serpentine shapes to provide stretchablility for the charging of any model. The receiving coil is adhered to the vehicle roof, and the transmitting coil hung over the vehicle is used to adjust the transmission distance. In order to improve the capability of coils, the design of windings is optimized to enhance stretchability and decrease the resistanceviafabricating treble strand serpentine copper traces. The results show that the charging efficiencies of the SWPT remain stable even though the coils are under bending and stretching. As an application demonstration, the SWPT system is installed on the roofs of two different model cars, respectively, and the results demonstrate that the charging efficiencies remain stable. Thus, this work paves a novel way to develop a stretchable, convenient, universal, and high-performance wireless power transfer system.

The MES with a-1.0 V (versus Ag/AgCl) applied cathodic potential exhibited a maximum methane production rate of 10.55 L CH4/m(2) cat/day and achieved a 96% final CH4 content. Applying real biogas from a field AD plant resulted in a comparable production rate of 8.8L CH4/m(2) cat/ day with 95% CH4. The scaled-up bench MES reactor (total volume of 6L) was evaluated, and the energy efficiencies of the laboratory-and bench-scale MES were compared. The next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed most methanogens (e.g., Methanobacterium, Methanothrix, and Methanobrevibacter) to be associated with the cathode surface rather than suspension. Cyclic voltammetry and field emission scanning electron microscopy showed that the electrode-associated cell predominantly controls the performance of the MES system. These results suggest that electrode-attached cells play a major role in the biogas upgrading of CO2 to CH4 in the MES system.

Under geological pressure and temperature conditions (beyond the critical region of methane), supercritical adsorption occurs between methane (CH4) molecules and coal surface. In order to better characterize CBM supercritical adsorption behaviors, isothermal adsorption tests were conducted to simulate the adsorption under different reservoir pressures and temperatures. It is observed that the temperature influences adsorption behaviors little under low-pressure conditions but weakens the sorption capacity of coals under highpressure conditions. Since the adsorption volume obtained from isothermal adsorption tests is Gibbs excess adsorption volume, it was transformed to the absolute adsorption volume which is essential for reliable gas-in-place estimates. A hypothesis was proposed that a maximum adsorption volume for a certain adsorbent exist in the limiting case of supercritical conditions. Based on this, the limiting adsorption model was built in reference to the Dubinin-Astakhov (DA) adsorption model and Henry dissolution law. Additionally, different energy varying trends (adsorption potential, adsorption space, reduction of surface free energy and isosteric heat of adsorption) over pressure and temperature indicate that the adsorption of CH4 by coals is actually the attraction between CH4 molecules and coal molecules and also a spontaneous process to reduce surface free energy of the system. The pressure and temperature exert an impact on sorption behaviors by controlling attraction forces or kinetic energy of adsorbate and adsorbent molecules. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influence of PBOZ content on the mechanical and tribological properties of PBOZ-BMI resin was researched. The results showed that suitable addition of PBOZ can enhance the mechanical properties and decrease the frictional coefficient and wear rate of PBOZ-BMI resin to some extent. The improvement of mechanical properties of PBOZ-BMI can be attributed to the cross hydrogen bonding and network interpenetrating. The wear mechanism of the PBOZ-BMI resin was converted from fatigue wear to adhesive wear after the addition of PBOZ, observed from the wear surface of the materials by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The enhancement of tribological properties is due to the high heat resistance of PBOZ, which can inhibit the adhesive wear during the wear effective.

Among them smartphone-based sensing systems are receiving special attention with the worldwide popularity of smartphones. Over the past decade, many devices, including a large number of smartphones in today's marketplace, are integrated with near field communication (NFC) modules. Leveraging the worldwide ubiquity of these devices, we developed wireless and passive NFC tag sensors based on flexible arid low-cost NFC tags for biochemical sensing. NFC-enabled smartphone was used to wirelessly power the sensors and receive the detection results through inductive coupling. By adopting rheostats in the resonant circuits of the sensors, we easily achieved accurate semi quantitative detection of different analytes constructed sensor arrays. The results demonstrated that the tag sensors could be used to discriminate gases at part-per-million concentrations and analytes in solution such as ions and bacteria in different concentration ranges.

Dense solid-phase sintered SiC ceramics were obtained by SPS with a holding time of 5 min at a temperature of similar to 1800 degrees C, which is similar to 350 degrees C lower than that required by conventional pressureless sintering (PS). The microstructure and mechanical properties of the ceramics was systematically investigated for different sintering temperatures. The sample relative density, flexural strength, hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness were determined to be 98.6%, 592 MPa, 28.3 GPa, 461 GPa and 3.6 MPa m(1/2), respectively. The spark plasma sintered specimens showed superior mechanical properties and finer grains compared to the pressurelessly sintered specimen. The densification kinetics for the spark plasma sintered SiC ceramics and the role of B4C in the sintering process were discussed.

Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows that 20 nm polystyrene nanoparticles with cationic surfaces adhere strongly to these lipid bilayer membranes. This adhesion is sensitive to the ionic strength of the surrounding medium and is independent of the lipid composition of the membrane, indicating that it is driven by nonspecific electrostatic interactions. Nanoparticles bound to the GUV membrane form extended protrusions that incorporate the membrane lipids. As the membrane material is pulled into these protrusions, the diameter of the GUV shrinks. This process is accompanied by the formation of transient pores in the membrane, as indicated by the leakage of high-molecular weight polymers from the GUV interior. There is an upper limit to the molecular weight of polymer that will leak through these pores; based on this size limit, the pore diameter can be estimated as 18-27 nm. These results suggest that nanoparticle adhesion imposes surface tension on biomembranes via a steric crowding mechanism, leading to poration. The phenomenon is potentially a physiologically relevant mode of interaction between nanoparticles and biomembranes, and may help explain observed plasma membrane permeabilization in the presence of broad classes of nanoparticles.

Stretchable Substrates for the Assembly of Polymeric Microstructures	SMALL			English	Article							CARBON NANOTUBES; COLLOIDAL NANOCRYSTALS; MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES; GOLD CONDUCTORS; THIN-FILMS; NANOSTRUCTURES; LITHOGRAPHY; PARTICLES; COMPLEX; MICROSPHERES	The directed assembly of micro-/nanoscale objects relies on physical or chemical processes to generate structures that are not possible via self-assembly alone. A relatively unexplored strategy in directed assembly is the "active" manipulation of building blocks through deformations of elastomeric substrates. This manuscript reports a method which uses macroscopic mechanical deformations of chemically modified silicone films to realize the rational assembly of microscopic polymer structures. Specifically, polystyrene microparticles are deposited onto polydimethylsiloxane substrates using microcontact-printing where, through a process that involved stretching/relaxing the substrates and bonding of the particles, they are elaborated into microstructures of various sizes, shapes, symmetries, periodicities, and functionalities. The resulting polymeric microstructures can be released and redeposited onto planar/nonplanar surfaces. When building blocks with different properties (e.g., those with fluorescent and catalytic properties) are used, it is possible to fabricate structures with heterogeneous functionality. This method can be extended to the assembly of numerous micro-/nanoscale building blocks (e.g., colloidal organic/inorganic materials) with rational control over the size, shape, and functionality of the product. As a strategy, the use of substrate deformations to enable the micromanipulation and fabrication of a potentially diverse set of assemblies represents a powerful tool useful to, for example, nanotechnology and micromanufacturing.

In this study, the anionic surfactant sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) was used as the CO2-soluble surfactant to stabilize CO2 foams in the presence of ethanol. The phase equilibrium relationships of the AOT/ethanol/CO2 system and the partition coefficient of AOT between supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) and water were measured through a fully visible pressure volume temperature (PVT) cell. In addition, the effects of the ethanol content on the partition coefficient and interfacial tension (IFT) were studied. Furthermore, a laboratory apparatus was developed to measure the viscosity and injection performance of AOT dissolved in an aqueous or SC-CO2 solution and SC-CO2 foams. The experimental data show that addition of ethanol can significantly improve the solubility of AOT in SC-CO2 and increase the partition coefficient of AOT. The IFT tests show that the ethanol content affects the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and IFT at cmc (gamma(cmc)) differently: with ethanol addition, gamma(cmc) decreases, while the cmc first decreases and then increases. The dissolution of AOT in SC-CO2 with ethanol could lead to a 3-fold increase for SC-CO2 viscosity, while the formation of SC-CO2 foam could result in an increase for viscosity of approximately 50-200 times. Finally, the core flooding results show that dissolved AOT in SC-CO2 could significantly improve the surfactant injectivity in tight rocks and interact with the formation water in situ to form SC-CO2 foams, controlling the mobility of the CO2. In addition, the performance of SC-CO2 foams could be governed by altering the ethanol content to adjust the surfactant partition coefficient.

J	Li, C; Shen, Q; Yao, LQ; Li, S				Li, Cheng; Shen, Quan; Yao, Linquan; Li, Shuang			Lateral Bending Vibration of Nanoscale Ultra-Thin Beams Using a Semi-Continuum Model	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL NANOSCIENCE			English	Article						Ultra-Thin Beams; Semi-Continuum; Nanoscale; Relaxation Coefficient; Atomic Layers; Size Dependence	NONLOCAL ELASTICITY THEORY; CARBON NANOTUBES; WAVE-PROPAGATION; DISPERSION; NANOBEAMS	A semi-continuum dynamical model involving the relaxation effects is constructed to investigate the mechanical properties of the lateral bending vibration of an ultra-thin beam with a nanoscale thickness. The governing equation of vibration is derived based on the Hamilton principle. Three different kinds of end supporting conditions including fully clamped, simply supported and cantilevered nanoscale ultra-thin beams are considered and various numerical results are analyzed and discussed in detail. Some comparisons between the semi-continuum and classical continuum models are presented. It is concluded that the variational tends of natural frequencies depend on the values of relaxation coefficient. For different relaxation coefficients, the natural frequencies may decrease or increase with an increase in the number of atomic layers. Hence an explanation is proposed for some contradictions that the bending stiffness of the nanoscale beams should be enhanced or weakened in current non-local elasticity theory. Moreover, the relations between the Young's modulus and the number of atomic layers are developed and it is clearly seen that the small scale has a significant effect on the Young's modulus. When the number of atomic layers, or the thickness of the beam is sufficiently large, the small scale effects disappear and the value of the Young's modulus is just recovered to the corresponding classical bulk material, which also proves the validity of the semi-continuum dynamical model proposed in this study.

While diamond thin films are typically clear or slightly gray in color, we demonstrate that diamond films of different optical properties and exhibiting different colors can be prepared by embedding Ag nanoparticles into the diamond film. Microwave plasma heating of Ag thin films deposited onto H-terminated diamond films grown on transparent fused quartz substrates leads to de-wetting and formation of a high density, two-dimensional array of size controlled Ag nanoparticles. Surprisingly, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show that starting with Ag films < 30 nm diameter, dewetting and subsequent growth of a second diamond layer encapsulates the Ag nanoparticles, forming dense 2-dimensional arrays of diamond-encapsulated Ag nano particles. Under conditions used here, initial Ag films > 30 Qm thickness lead to more polydisperse nanoparticles and the formation of Ag/diamond core/shell structures. By changing the thickness of the deposited Ag layer, the Ag nanoparticle size distribution can be changed, leading to changes in optical properties. Three-dimensional electromagnetic field modeling was performed for SiO2-diamond/Ag/diamond-air structures produced by de wetting of 20 nm thick Ag films show good qualitative agreement with experimental spectra.

Their production is hindered by difficulties in obtaining atomically sharp interface free from intermixture. Here we report the continuous construction of a lateral heterostructure using blue phosphorene and tetrafluoro-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F(4)TCNQ) as the building blocks. The lateral heterostructure is achieved by linking the semiconducting F(4)TCNQ-Au metal organic framework and the metallic blue phosphorene-Au network via Au adatoms. The structural and electronic properties of the heterostructure have been investigated by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S), complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, demonstrating a structurally and electrically abrupt interface. Our approach offers the possibility of high flexibility and control that can be extended to other metal-organic species and 2D materials, establishing a foundation for the development of atomically thin in-plane superlattice and devices.

For the high-precision inversion of the column length, we propose a set of methods on the basis of the actual conditions, including autocorrelation detection, adaptive filtering, Gaussian decomposition, and optimized Levenberg-Marquardt fitting based on the generalized Gaussian distribution. Then, based on the information of a pair of laser pulses, we use the direct adjustment method of unequal precision to eliminate the error in the distance measurement. Further, the effect of atmospheric delay on distance measurements is considered, leading to further correction of the inversion results. At last, an airborne experiment was carried out in a sea area near Qinhuangdao, China on 14 March 2019. The results showed that the ranging accuracy can reach 0.9066 m, which achieved an excellent ranging accuracy on 1.57-mu m IPDA Lidar and met the requirement for high-precision CO2 column length inversion.

It took less than two hours for 2.0 g of NiO particles to obtain 96.1% of reduction extent using 100% of theoretical charge, which gives 96.1% current efficiency.

Photoinduced Localized Phonons and Instantaneous Structure Contributing to Amplified Spontaneous Emission of Conjugated Polymers	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							CONDUCTING POLYMER; PHOTONIC CRYSTAL; LASING ACTION; LASER ACTION; DYE; MODE; MICROCAVITIES; PATHWAYS; GRAPHENE; DRIVEN	Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), as a microscopic dynamical process, significantly influences the quality of optically pumped conjugated polymeric lasers. Based on the continuous optical pumping that couples with the prominent self-trapping process of conjugated polymer, four localized phonon modes are distinguished in conjugated polymers, all of which greatly contribute to localization of the excited state as well as local distortion along alternating single and double bonds. Consequently, the ultrafast localized distortion of alternating bonds constructs instantaneous structures-an effective four-level electronic structure and population inversion-for ASE. It is shown that all the evolving localized vibrational modes possess even parity, which not only makes it highly possible to be probed through the infrared phonon spectrum, but also opens up an opportunity to improve the quantum efficiency of a polymer ASE/laser by modification of localized phonon modes.

The PGA concentration reached a maximum of 39.4 +/- 0.19 g L-1, and the highest molecular weight obtained was (19.0 +/- 0.02) x 10(5) Da with the addition of 0.3% n-heptane. However, n-dodecane decreased the PGA concentration and molecular weight to final values of 20.1 +/- 0.10 g L-1 and (8.4 +/- 0.02) x 10(5) Da, respectively. Analysis of the intracellular nucleotide levels of B. subtilis NX-2 with n-heptane and n-dodecane additives showed that the lowest NADH/NAD(+) ratio and ATP levels were obtained with the n-dodecane additives, which can explain the decreased PGA yield and molecular weight. The metabolic flux distribution of B. subtilis NX-2 with n-heptane and n-dodecane additives was also investigated. Flux distribution was primarily directed to the EMP and TCA cycles with n-heptane additives. The flux of 2-oxoglutarate to intracellular glutamate and the flux distribution from extracellular to intracellular glutamate both increased to improve PGA production. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The differential capacitance curve (Cd- U) of asymmetric camel-shaped. The higher C-d of EMIM+/TF- than the EMIM /FSI- at 0-0.5 V and 1.1-2.4 attributed to the formation of a thinner EDL of EMIM+/Tf- induced by the smaller size of Tf- Fsr. In addition, because of the fewer interaction sites between cations and Tf- with the more negative charge distribution, Tf- anions are expelled away from the charged electrode more easily, makes more effective screening of EMIM+/ESI- to the charged electrode than that of Accordingly, the C-d of EMIM+/Tf- within the potential of- 1.1 V to 0 V is higher than that of the FSI-. At highly negative potentials of 2.5 V to 1.1 V, FSI- with more interaction sites with cations gradually squeezed out from the EDL, and more cations of Emim+/Fsi- accumulate to replace leading to a higher Cd of EMIM-VESI- than EMIM+/Tr. Meanwhile, the Cd of EMIM+/Tr sharply due to the thicker EDL resulted from the overcrowded counterions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The competition betweenKondo correlations and superconductivity in Josephson quantum dot (QD) devices results in two different ground states and the occurrence of a 0-pi quantum phase transition. Here we report on transport measurements on hybrid superconductor-InSb nanowire QD devices with different device geometries. We demonstrate a realization of continuous gate-tunable ABSs with both 0-type levels and pi-type levels. This allow us to manipulate the transition between the 0 and pi junction and explore charge transport and spectrum in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition regime. Furthermore, we find a coexistence of 0-type ABS and pi-type ABS in the same charge state. By measuring temperature and magnetic field evolution of the ABSs, the different natures of the two sets of ABSs are verified, being consistent with the scenario of phase transition between the singlet and doublet ground state. Our study provides insight into Andreev transport properties of hybrid superconductor-QD devices and sheds light on the crossover behavior of the subgap spectrum in the vicinity of the 0-pi transition.

It is found that a positive perpendicular electric field F can act as a catalyst to reduce the energy barrier of H-2 dissociative adsorption on silicene, which facilitates the hydrogenation of silicene. In addition, it is found that the barrier decreases as F increases, and when F is above 0.05 a.u. (1 a.u. = 5.14 x 10(11) V m(-1)), the barrier is quite low and hydrogenation of silicene can take place efficiently at room temperature. The catalytic effect of the electric field on hydrogenation of silicene is induced by the redistribution of atomic charge under the electric field, which would change the chemical activity of silicene significantly.

A Persistent Oxygen Anomaly Reveals the Fate of Spilled Methane in the Deep Gulf of Mexico	SCIENCE			English	Article							OXIDATION; HYDRATE; CARBON; DISSOCIATION; INPUT	Methane was the most abundant hydrocarbon released during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Beyond relevancy to this anthropogenic event, this methane release simulates a rapid and relatively short-term natural release from hydrates into deep water. Based on methane and oxygen distributions measured at 207 stations throughout the affected region, we find that within similar to 120 days from the onset of release similar to 3.0 x 10(10) to 3.9 x 10(10) moles of oxygen were respired, primarily by methanotrophs, and left behind a residual microbial community containing methanotrophic bacteria. We suggest that a vigorous deepwater bacterial bloom respired nearly all the released methane within this time, and that by analogy, large-scale releases of methane from hydrate in the deep ocean are likely to be met by a similarly rapid methanotrophic response.

A new unsteady-state method of determining two-phase relative permeability illustrated by CO2-brine primary drainage in Berea sandstone	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						Relative permeability; Unsteady-state method; Local phase flux; Fractional flow theory; CO2-brine system; Primary drainage	CARBON-DIOXIDE; SUPERCRITICAL CO2; GEOLOGIC STORAGE; OIL-RECOVERY; GAS; DISPLACEMENT; BRINE; WATER; SOLUBILITY; INJECTION	This study presents a new unsteady-state method for measuring two-phase relative permeability by obtaining local values of the three key parameters (saturation, pressure drop, and phase flux) versus time during a displacement. These three parameters can be substituted to two-phase Darcy Buckingham equation to directly determine relative permeability. To obtain the first two, we use a medical X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scanner to monitor saturation in time and space, and six differential pressure transducers to measure the overall pressure drop and the pressure drops of five individual sections (divided by four pressure taps on the core) continuously. At each scanning time, the local phase flux is obtained by spatially integrating the saturation profile and converting this to the flux using a fractional flow framework. One advantage of this local method over most previous methods is that the capillary end effect is experimentally avoided; this improvement is crucial for experiments using low viscosity fluids such as supercritical and gas phases. To illustrate the new method, we conduct five CO2-brine primary drainage experiments in a 60.8 cm long and 116 mD Berea sandstone core at 20 degrees C and 1500 psi. In return, we obtain hundreds of unsteady-state CO2 and brine relative permeability data points that are consistent with steady-state relative permeability data from the same experiments. Due to the large amount of relative permeability data obtained by the new unsteady-state method, the uncertainties of the exponents in the Corey-type fits decrease by up to 90% compared with the steady-state method.

The prepared samples were characterized by scanning microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption (BET) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The photocatalytic activity of Zn-TiO2/pBC was further investigated through the photodegradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Compared with TiO2 and TiO2/pBC, Zn-TiO2/pBC had better photocatalytic activity under visible light due to zinc elements effectively inhibiting the agglomeration of TiO2 and hindering the combination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The removal rate of SMX could reach 81.21%, which was 1.37 times higher than that of TiO2/pBC(300). Three common anions (SO42-, Cl-, NO3-) existing in the Yellow River exhibited detrimental effects on the SMX photodegradation to a certain degree. It might mainly occurred hydroxylation, cleavage of S-N bond and opening of isoxazole ring reactions during the photodegradation process of SMX. Meanwhile, there might be four main degradation pathways proposed throw the LC/MS/MS analysis.

The p-type spiro film is spin-coated on the surface of the Ga2O3 film deposited on a Si wafer via a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system. Benefitting from the superior carrier-separation ability of the double built-in electric fields, the effective carrier transport of the novel vertical structure and the high solar-blind UV transmittance of the spiro film, the self-powered responsivity of the p-i-n-type photodetector based on spiro/Ga2O3/Si increases to 4.43 mA W-1 under UV light (lambda = 254 nm), which is similar to 54-fold that of the Ga2O3/Si photodetector (0.22 mA W-1). Meanwhile, the response speed (0.03/0.196 s) of the p-i-n device is also dramatically improved by introducing the spiro layer. The reported achievements of our work provide a new way to construct a high-sensitivity self-powered UV photodetector for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.

Construction of multijunction systems is an effective strategy to overcome the serious drawbacks of fast charge recombination and the limited visible-light absorption of semiconductor photocatalysts. Here, we report a novel quaternary heterogeneous photocatalyst fabricated by loading Ag nanoparticles onto ZnO nanowires and subsequent simultaneous formation of core/shell structured ZnO@ZnS and Ag@Ag2S heterojunctions via a one-step anion-exchange sulfuration reaction process. The resulting four-component ZnO@ZnS/Ag@Ag2S multijunction photocatalyst exhibits a high hydrogen evolution activity (140.3 mol g(-1)) under simulated solar light irradiation in 5 h, far exceeding those of bare ZnO (30.8 mol g(-1)), ZnO@ZnS (92.8 mol g(-1)) and ZnO/Ag (45.1 mol g(-1)) counterparts. The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the formation of both Z-scheme and type II core/shell heterojunctions, favoring light absorption and separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the composite. This work provides a facile, controlled method for the fabrication of multicomponent heterostructures used for efficient solar water splitting.

Patterns of water and tillage erosion on topographically complex landscapes in the North American Great Plains	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						landscape segmentation; soil erosion; tillage erosion; water erosion	SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; SOUTHWESTERN ONTARIO; REDISTRIBUTION; TRANSLOCATION; SEGMENTATION; NITROGEN; CS-137; FIELD	Two field sites located in the northern region of the North American Great Plains were examined to investigate the contributions of water and tillage erosion towards total soil erosion in topographically complex landscapes (hummocky and undulating landscapes). Results indicated that both water and tillage erosion contributed substantially to total erosion in the undulating landscape while tillage erosion dominated in the hummocky landscape. The patterns of water, tillage and total soil erosion can be predicted using landscape segmentation in such landscapes. Soil properties and crop yield are also related to soil erosion. Landscape segmentation can be used as a simple tool to more easily represent the spatial variability of soil erosion and affected biophysical processes such as crop production, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emission and pesticide fate, and to target soil conservation practices toward the most intensive erosion processes on given landform elements.

Development of a Li2O Sensor Based on a Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Membrane for Oxide Reduction in a Molten LiCl-Li2O Electrolyte at 650 degrees C	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Lithium oxide sensor; yttria stabilized zirconia; oxide reduction; potentiometry; reference electrode	ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; URANIUM OXIDE; ANODE; SALT; SOLUBILITY; GRAPHITE; CARBON; FUEL; UO2	LiCl-Li2O salt is a widely used electrolyte for the electrochemical reduction of spent oxide (mainly uranium oxide) fuels, and the Li2O concentration is usually controlled at about 1.41 mol % for optimum operation and corrosion mitigation of the platinum anode material. Due to the small difference in reduction potential between UO2 and Li2O, some Li2O will be reduced during the oxide reduction process, leading to a Li2O deviation from the desired 1.41 mol %. Monitoring of the Li2O concentration is desired for proper control of the electrochemical oxide reduction process. In this paper, a Li2O sensor based on a yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) membrane was developed and tested to evaluate the feasibility of using the Li2O sensor to monitor the Li2O concentrations in the range of 0.57 to 1.69 mol % Li2O in LiCl-Li2O salt systems-one without dissolved Li metal and another with 0.24 mol % dissolved Li metal. The experimental results show that the open circuit potential of the Li2O sensor logarithmically responded to the concentration of Li2O in LiCl-Li2O salts with or without the presence of Li metal, suggesting that YSZ appears promising for real-time monitoring of the Li2O concentration in LiCl-Li2O salt for an oxide reduction process. The Li2O sensor developed herein is based on a potentiometry measurement that requires a stable, reliable reference electrode (RE), particularly for long-term Li2O concentration monitoring. To this end, a novel Ag/AgCl RE that is contained in a high-density MgO tube with a closed end was developed and exhibited stable electrode potential, chemical compatibility with LiCl-Li2O, and good mechanical strength. The performance of the newly developed Ag/AgCl RE was demonstrated in Li2O monitoring by comparing it with a traditional Ni/NiO RE.

Evaluation of Exponential Fertilization Technique for Cultivation of Turfgrass during Early Growth Period	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						exponential fertilization; fescue; nitrogen; steady-state nutrition; turfgrass	NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; FIR SEEDLINGS; BIOMASS; PERFORMANCE; NUTRITION; RESPONSES; CARBON	The exponential fertilization method is based on the theory of supplying steady-state nutrition to young seedlings during the early, exponential growth stage. The objective of the research was to find the most effective method of fertilizing turfgrass during the early growth stage following seedling emergence. The field experiment was performed on turfgrass (tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) comparing a check (no fertilizer applied), two conventional fertilization techniques (equal additions and linearly increasing application rates over time) to the exponential additions fertilization method to test the relative effectiveness of this latter technique relative to conventional methods. Results show that the exponential growth period for fescue is the first 5 weeks following planting. Biomass accumulation, total nitrogen (N) concentration, and N content per seedling in turfgrass seedlings fertilized using the exponential addition fertilization technique were 32, 35, and 70% greater than those treated with traditional methods, respectively.

Unfortunately, almost all RTP sensors are operated on quenching-based mechanisms given the sensitive nature of the emissive triplet state. Here we report a type of thioether RTP molecules that shows RTP "turn-on" when volatile acid vapors such as HCl are in contact. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, model thioethers containing different donor/acceptor combinations are investigated via fluorescence spectroscopy and theoretical calculations aided by molecular coordinates obtained from single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It is revealed that a charge-transfer character in the phosphorescence state is crucial. The "turn-on" design concept may significantly broaden the sensing application scope for organic RTP molecules.

In the current study, the pristine graphyne (GY) without and with a single Mn atom is investigated to detect the gas molecules (CO, CH4, CO2, NH3, NO and O-2). The pristine GY is promising to detect O-2 molecules because of its chemical adsorption on GY with large electron transfer. The great stability of the Mn/GY is found, and the Mn atom prefers to anchor at the alkyne ring as a single atom. Upon single Mn atom anchoring, the sensitivity and selectivity of GY based gas sensors is significantly improved for various molecules, except CH4. The recovery time of the Mn/GY after detecting the gas molecules may help to appraise the detection efficiency for the Mn/GY. The current study will help to understand the mechanism of detecting the gas molecules, and extend the potentially fascinating applications of GY-based materials.

Silicone phenolic resin was first synthesized via esterification reaction between methyltrimethoxysilane and novolac phenolic resin; then the degree of self-polymerization of silane was controlled by the hydrolyzation reaction. The designed structure of the hybrids was confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-1-NMR and Si-29-NMR), and curing of the hybrids was performed to obtain samples for microstructure observation and anti-oxidation evaluation. In situ self-polymerization of the silane during both the hydrolyzation and the curing processes led to phase separation in the cured hybrids, and the size of the phase structure increased with the increase of self-polymerization degree of the silane. Thermogravimetric analysis and high-temperature oxidation test were performed, and silane introduction was found to be beneficial to the enhancement of both thermal stability and oxidation resistance. Anti-oxidation mechanisms for the phenolic resin modified with silanes at different polymerization degree were compared and discussed. (C)2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The GNPs SA exhibits a modulation depth of 5.4% and a nonsaturable loss of 21.3%. Due to the saturable absorption and the high nonlinearity, dual-wavelength and triple-wavelength Q-switched pulse operations are obtained at pump power levels of 200 and 500 mW. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever reported use of GNPs as SA in multiwavelength Q-switched lasing generation.

Reducing metal to ultrathin profile may improve absorption efficiency, but a maximal 50% absorption limit induced by the field continuity exists. Here, we experimentally show that broadband, perfect (100%) absorption of microwaves can be realized in a single layer of ultrathin conductive film when illuminated coherently by two oppositely directed incident beams. Our experiments keep the field continuity and simultaneously break the 50% limit. Inheriting the intrinsic broadband feature of metals, complete absorption is observed to be frequency independent in microwave experiments from 6 to 18 GHz. Remarkably, this occurs in films with thicknesses that are at the extreme subwavelength scales, similar to lambda/10000 or less. Our work proposes a way to achieve total electromagnetic wave absorption in an ultrawide spectrum of radio waves and microwaves with a simple conductive film.

J	Wang, L; Li, S; Gao, S				Wang, Lei; Li, Steven; Gao, Simon			Do Greenhouse Gas Emissions Affect Financial Performance? - an Empirical Examination of Australian Public Firms	BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Australian public firms; corporate social performance; environmental performance; financial performance; greenhouse gas emission; Tobin's q	CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; MARKET VALUE; BOTTOM-LINE; TOBIN-Q; RESPONSIBILITY; METAANALYSIS; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; CARBON	Previous studies that have attempted to relate corporate environmental performance to financial performance have generated conflicting results. This paper presents the findings of a study on the relationship between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the financial performance of Australian corporations. Using multiple regression models and data from a sample of 69 Australian public companies, this paper finds a positive correlation between GHG emissions and corporate financial performance. By testing the statistical significance of GHG emission factors in determining company Tobin's q, this study finds that a stronger Tobin's q often correlates with higher GHG emissions across all industry sectors. This finding is contrary to evidence found in previous studies conducted in other countries. The positive correlation found in this study could be explained with reference to the unique economic structure and development of Australia, particularly its dominant mining industry.

However, few field studies can be conducted to confirm the aerosol transport along these valleys due to the harsh environment and limited power supply. Individual particle collection instruments offer the unique advantage of collecting samples and tracing particle sources in remote areas due to their portability and efficiency. In this study, transmission electron microscopy was used to study individual particles collected in two trans-Himalayan valleys. We found that 49-70% of thousands of particles were light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols including soot-bearing and tarball-bearing particles in December of 2017. The dominant sizes of soot-bearing and tarball-bearing particles were 151-370 and 198-255 nm, respectively. The WRF-Chem model and wind field analyses show that the intense regional air pollution with high mass concentrations of light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosol occurred in the South Asia and southwest wind normally prevailed along the trans-Himalayan valleys in the afternoon of each day during wintertime. Backward trajectory and CALIPSO data further confirm that these light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols from the South Asia were transported to the southern HTP. These carbonaceous aerosols exhibited significantly internally mixing with secondary sulfates. Here individual particle analysis coupled with the WRF-Chem model, the meteorological observation data, and satellite data confirm the trans-Himalayan valleys as the direct channels for abundant carbonaceous aerosols lifting from the South Asia to the HTP.

However, the impact of adsorption of molecules on the magnetism of intrinsic 2D magnets is not yet sufficiently understood. Inspired by the recent discovery of intrinsic 2D ferromagnetism in atomically thin Cr2Ge2Te6 and CrI3 crystals, in this investigation, the adsorption of gas molecules including CO, CO2, H2O, N-2, NH3, NO, NO2, O-2 and SO2 on the basal plane of a Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) monolayer was systematically investigated by density functional theory. The structures, energy, charge transfer, work function, and electronic and magnetic properties of the gas molecule adsorbed Cr2Ge2Te6 monolayers were explored. It has been found that the adsorption of gas molecules significantly influences the electronic and magnetic properties of a CGT sheet. It was observed that the adsorption of molecules could effectively enhance the ferromagnetism and Curie temperature (T-C) of the CGT sheet. Notably, a remarkable enhancement of ferromagnetism and T-C by 38% and 32% was achieved by the adsorption of NO and NO2, respectively. Moreover, NO2 adsorbed CGT exhibits a semiconductor-to-metal transition. The enhanced ferromagnetism and tunable electronic structure could be ascribed to the considerable charge transfer as well as to the alignment of the frontier molecular orbital. The outcome of this study reveals not only exciting insights into the environmental effect on 2D magnets but also provides a new candidate as a NO2 gas sensor.

The composite presents a heterogeneous structure of MnO2 nanosheets anchoring on the surface of acetylene black tightly. The AMOA anode shows excellent stability during initial-stage cycles at different current densities for lithium-ion batteries. The discharge capacity can maintain at 968 mAh g-1 and 410 mAh g-1 at 1 and 5 A g-1 after 40 cycles, respectively. The excellent performance can be attributed to amorphous materials, which mitigate volume expansion and promote phase transition. Moreover, the amorphous material can remain amorphous structure after 40 cycles.

Weyl-loop half-metal in Li-3(FeO3)(2)	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							DISCOVERY; SEMIMETAL; FERMIONS; SCHEMES; CARBON	Nodal-line metals and semimetals, as interesting topological states of matter, have been mostly studied in nonmagnetic materials. Here, based on first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we predict that fully spin polarized Weyl loops can be realized in the half-metal state of the three-dimensional material Li-3(FeO3)(2). We show that this material has a ferromagnetic ground state, and it is a half-metal with only a single spin channel present near the Fermi level. The spin-up bands form two separate Weyl loops close to the Fermi level, which arise from band inversions and are protected by the glide mirror symmetry. One loop is type I, whereas the other loop is the hybrid type. Corresponding to these two loops in the bulk, on the (100) surface, there exist two fully spin polarized drumheads of surface states within the surface projections of the loops. The effects of the electron correlation and the spin-orbit coupling, as well as the possible hourglass Weyl chains in the nonmagnetic state, are discussed. The realization of fully spin polarized Weyl-loop fermions in the bulk and drumhead fermions on the surface for a half-metal may generate promising applications in spintronics.

In this article, a novel acid-etched coal fly ash/TiO2 nanocomposites photocatalyst was prepared by HCl etching followed by sol-gel method. The prepared nanocomposite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and UV-vis diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) techniques. The photocatalytic degradation efficiency were evaluated by using methyl orange as model. Compared with the CFA (no HCl etching)/TiO2 nanocomposites, the prepared CFA/TiO2 nanocomposites had much better photodegradation efficiency. The preparation and application of CFA/TiO2 nanocomposites will promote the high value-added application of CFA greatly. [GRAPHICS] .

Nevertheless, many proposed applications require efficient modulation of magnetism and spatial charge distribution within these 2D nanostructures. Here we, via density functional theory (DFT), demonstrated that both magnetism and spatial charge distribution of recently experimentally realized germanane can be effectively modulated via a simple dehydrogenating process. Both single-sided and double-sided H vacancy clusters due to the unpairing of Ge-4p electrons can make germanane obtain magnetism with designated magnitudes. Charges of valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) in germanane that contains single-sided H vacancy clusters can be effectively separated, and charges of VBM and CBM in germanane that contains double-sided H vacancy clusters can be effectively assembled. Thus, our results provide a new perspective on precisely modulating magnetism and spatial charge distribution of germanane, which are fundamentally important for application of germanane in quantum information and optoelectronic fields.

This nanoprobe showed the intrinsic emission of AuNCs at 650 nm and a weak emission at 490 nm from 8Q5S. Based on chelation-enhanced fluorescence of 8Q5S induced by its specific and high affinity for phosphate upon binding Mg2+ and the stable fluorescence of AuNCs as the reference, this nanoprobe was demonstrated to exhibit highly sensitive, selective, and reliable detection of phosphate in the linear range from 0 to 50 mu M with a low detection limit of 0.14 mu M. Furthermore, the presented ratiometric fluorescent sensor was successfully employed for accurate quantitation of phosphate in complex human serum samples with satisfactory results.

Valley-dependent properties of monolayer MoSi2N4, WSi2N4, and MoSi2As4	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							2-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS; TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; TRANSITION; GRAPHENE; POLARIZATION; PHASE; VALVE; MOS2	In a recent work, new two-dimensional materials, monolayer MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4, were successfully synthesized in experiment, and several other monolayer materials with a similar structure, such as MoSi2As4, were predicted [Hong et al., Science 369, 670 (2020)]. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we investigate the electronic and optical properties of monolayer MoSi2N4, WSi2N4, and MoSi2As4. We show that these materials are semiconductors, with a pair of Dirac-type valleys located at the corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. Due to the broken inversion symmetry and the effect of spin-orbit coupling, the valley fermions manifest spin-valley coupling, valley-contrasting Berry curvature, and valley-selective optical circular dichroism. We also construct the low-energy effective model for the valleys, calculate the spin Hall conductivity and the permittivity, and investigate the strain effect on the band structure. Our result reveals interesting valley physics in monolayer MoSi2N4, WSi2N4, and MoSi2As4, suggesting their great potential for valleytronics and spintronics applications.

Here, we developed an all-in-one nanomedicine strategy to systemically co-deliver photosensitive, chemotherapeutic, and immunomodulating agents for effective immunochemo-photothermal therapy (PTT) to inhibit both primary tumor and distal metastatic tumor. Two types of polydopamine (dp)-coated nanoparticles (NPs) (N/PGEM/dp-5 and N/PGEM/dp-16) co-loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and NLG919, a potent indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor, were prepared. N/PGEM/dp-16 NPs with a thicker dp coating layer showed higher photothermal conversion ability, more favorable biodistribution profile and better tumor inhibition effect compared to N/PGEM/dp-5 NPs with a thinner coating layer. Combination with laser irradiation further enhanced the tumor inhibition effect of N/PGEM/dp-16 NPs. In an "early metastatic" pancreatic cancer PANC02 model with small distal tumors, introduction of NLG and dp coating improved the inhibition effect on both primary and distal tumors. Compared to N/PGEM/dp-16, N/PGEM/dp-16 plus laser irradiation further enhanced the inhibition effect on primary tumor, but didn't improve the abscopal antitumor effect. When the initial volume of distal tumor was sufficiently large in a "late metastasis" model, a more dramatic abscopal antitumor effect was achieved, resulting in a significant growth inhibition of both primary tumor and the unirradiated distal tumor. Furthermore, laser irradiation can amplify the immunochemo-NPs-mediated innate and adaptive immune responses in both tumors. This work demonstrated a distal tumor-size dependent abscopal effect, and provided a perspective for future design of more effective immunochemo-PTT nano-formulations for earlyand late-stage metastatic tumors.

A Computational Study of Dicationic Ionic Liquids/CO2 Interfaces	LANGMUIR			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; CO2 CAPTURE; DYNAMICS; SOLUBILITY; SIMULATION; STABILITY; CATION; WATER	Recent studies on CO2 capture using dicationic ionic liquids (DILs) demonstrated that DILs are promising absorbents for CO2 uptake especially compared with monocationic ionic liquids (MILs) analogues, in which each cation carries single positive charge in contrast to two unit charges of a dication. However, DILs/CO2 interfacial properties at the molecular level are still unknown. This work investigated the CO2 absorption properties of representative DILs, 1-alkyl-3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [C-n(mim)(2)](Tf2N)(2) (n = 3, 6, 12), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The higher interfacial CO2 density at DIL than that at MIL interfaces suggests the increased CO2 interaction sites in DILs. The interfacial CO2 density also exhibits an alkyl chain length dependence which decreases with the elongation of alkyl chain and proportionally correlates with the content of fluorine atoms at interfaces. Different alkyl chain orientations in DILs were illustrated in contrast to those of MILs; both DILs and CO2 inside DILs exhibit lower diffusivity than MILs, in agreement with the stronger cation-anion binding energy of DILs. Moreover, DILs show a lower H2O and N-2 uptake from flue gas compared with MILs, implicating the higher CO2/H2O and CO2/N-2 selectivity.

The Ministry of Environmental Protection of China has approved the implementation of emissions trading pilot projects in 11 provinces since 2007, yet the effectiveness of the policy has not been comprehensively estimated. With panel data from 29 provinces and cities in China between 2003 and 2012, this study uses the data envelopment model-slack based measurement (DEA-SBM) method to measure environmental efficiency indicators and a difference in difference (DID) model to examine the impact of the emissions trading system on environmental efficiency. The results indicate that the policy has significantly improved environmental efficiency in the pilot provinces. However, the effects are heterogeneous with different efficiency levels across the diverse regions. Higher impacts were found in the central and western regions. Some suggestions for the optimization of the emissions trading system are suggested in this study.

Herein, an ultra-low-cost zeolite-based NFM was developed by a simple hydrothermal method using fly ash as the raw material and used for the high-efficiency filtration of organic pollutants from wastewater. The as-obtained zeolite membrane was composed of crystalline analcime (ANA) type zeolite and amorphous geopolymer (GP) composite. Benefiting from the defects introduced large cavities and microporous channels in ANA, the ANA/GP composite membrane with a thickness of similar to 60 mu m exhibited permeation rates as high as 340-440 L/(m(2).h.MPa), and the rejection rates are up to 97 % towards methylene blue. Moreover, the fabrication cost of the ANA/GP membrane is only $31.8/m(2), far lower than the reported efficient NFMs. The development of the ANA/GP-NFM paves the way for developing commercially applicable membranes for organics separation and water purification.

Effect of nano Ni-Fe alloy addition on flash pyrolysis of poly(ethylene glycol)	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS			English	Article						Poly(ethylene glycol); Nano Ni-Fe alloy; Flash pyrolysis; Radicals; End groups	CARBON-TETRACHLORIDE; THERMAL-DEGRADATION; NANOPARTICLES; PRODUCTS; TRICHLOROETHYLENE; DECHLORINATION; PROPELLANTS; PARTICLES; POWDERS; WATER	Flash pyrolysis of p-PEG (pure PEG) and PEG/NiFe (mixture of PEG and nano Ni-Fe alloy) was carried out in argon atmosphere, aiming to study the effect of nano Ni-Fe alloy on the behavior and mechanism of PEG pyrolysis. A special combinational system was designed to perform pyrolysis experiment and collect pyrolysis products, while GC/MS was employed to identify the products. The experimental results showed that nano Ni-Fe alloy changed not only the relative contents but also the series of PEG pyrolysis products. It was interesting that all of 15 possible series of PEG pyrolysis products in theory were detected from p-PEG and/or PEG/NiFe pyrolysis in the present work. Six product series disappeared and two new product series were detected after adding nano Ni-Fe alloy. Based on quantitative analysis of the end groups of products, the effect of nano Ni-Fe alloy on PEG pyrolysis process as well as the mechanism was discussed. Ni and Fe played quite different roles in the process of PEG pyrolysis. Fe made end group -O-CH2-CH3, -O-CH=CH2, -OH and -O-CH3 transfer to -O-CH2-CHO by inducing hydrogen transfer and O-C bond cleavage; Ni made -O-CH=CH2 transfer to -O-CH2-CH3 by inducing hydrogenation.

Aqueous enzymatic extraction (AEE) of oil from Myrica rubra kernels was performed. The four AEE parameters namely mixed enzyme (cellulose/neutral protease = 1/2, w/w) amount, liquid/solid ratio, extraction time, and temperature, were optimised by response surface methodology. The statistical analysis indicated that the enzyme amount, liquid/solid ratio, time, and the quadratics of liquid/solid ratio, and enzyme amount, as well as the interactions between time and temperature, showed significant effects on oil yield. The optimal extraction conditions for oil yield were mixed enzyme amount, liquid/solid ratio, time, temperature as 3.17% (w/w), 4.91 ml/g, 4 h and 51.6 degrees C. Under the optimum conditions, the experimental oil extraction yield was 31.15%. The GC-MS analysis showed that the oil was abundant in the unsaturated fatty acids (9-octadecenoic acid and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid accounting for more than 80%), and the AEE was more efficient method to extract polyunsaturated fatty acid than the organic solvent process.

To investigate the durability of metal BP stack, this paper performed a durability test of 2000 hours on a 10-cell metal BP fuel cell stack. The degradations of the average voltage and individual cell voltage in fuel cell stack were analyzed. To investigate the degradation mechanism, the stack was disassembled and the morphologies and compositions of no. 1, no. 5, and no. 10 cells after 2000 hours were characterized by SEM, TEM, and ASS. The results indicated that at 800 mA/cm(2), the voltage decay rate is 42.303 mu V/hour and the voltage decay percentage of the stack is 14.34% after 2000 hours according to the linearly fitting result. According to the US Department of Energy (DOE) definition of fuel cell stack life, only the voltage decay rate of OCV and the tenth cell is lower than the maximum voltage degradation rates of 10 000 hours. The decreases of homogeneity of stack were the main reason for its performance degradation. Especially for the tenth cell, its performance has almost no drop. The main failure reason of this metal BP stack is structural design rather than metal corrosion. The losses of Pt catalyst and C supporting are the main reason of performance degradation.

However, how to introduce VEGF to a fracture site safely and effectively is still a challenge. This study aimed to prepare a VEGF-loaded nanographene coated internal fixation screw and to evaluate its effects in the treatment of femoral neck fracture. Methods Nanographene coated screws were prepared by direct liquid-phase exfoliation of the graphite method, and the surface characteristics were observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). VEGF was loaded on nanographene coatings through physical adsorption, and the VEGF controlled release was examined by ELISA. Then a canine femoral neck fracture model was built to examine both the angiogenic and osteogenic properties of the VEGF-loaded coated screws. X-ray, micro-CT-based microangiography, and histopathologic evaluation were used to assess the fracture healing progress. Results The results demonstrated that nanographene could load VEGF effectively, and the accumulative release of VEGF clearly increased during the entire testing period (9 days) without burst release. In canine fracture models, the results of X-ray, microangiography, and histopathologic examination proved that the speed of fracture healing, new bone formation area, and revascularization of the fractured femoral heads in the VEGF-loaded coated screws groups were significantly higher than in the control groups. Conclusion Our study proved that VEGF-loaded nanographene coated screws were effective in the treatment of femoral neck fracture and prevention of avascular necrosis of femoral head.

During the four study years, the mean annual precipitation and air temperature were slightly lower than their long-term averages (1322 vs 1487 mm and 20.1 vs 21.7 degrees C, respectively). Mean annual ET in the four study years was estimated at 1029 mm, accounted for 78% of the corresponding annual precipitation. Mean daily ecosystem ET was 2.6 mm day(-1) during the dry season from November to April and was 3.1 mm day(-1) during the rainy season from May to October. The ET diurnal variations in the cool-dry season (from November to February), the hot-dry season (March and April) and the rainy season had similar maximum values, although the soil water content, leaf area index (LAI) and climate conditions differed greatly. ET was mainly controlled by soil water availability in the hot-dry season, by LAI in the early rainy season (May and June) and by atmospheric conditions in the mid-to-late rainy season (from July to October) and the cool-dry season. The total ET was substantially higher than the corresponding precipitation in the dry season. The extra amount of water evapotranspirated in the dry season was mainly due to the depletion of soil water stored in the previous rainy season. Fog deposition during the dry season also played a role in providing water for ET. Our results indicated the importance of interannual interactions of water balance in the seasonal distribution of ecosystem ET at this site. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The free energy diagrams for an associative mechanism are firstly given to identify the rate-determining step for the ORR on the (111) surface of monoclinic, tetragonal and cubic phase zirconia. The calculation results show that the first electron transfer is the rate-determining step for the ORR on monoclinic and cubic phase zirconia, whereas the last electron transfer is the rate-limiting step for the ORR on tetragonal phase zirconia. The d-electron partial density of states for the active zirconium atoms is calculated to explore the relationship between the ORR catalytic activity of zirconia with different phases and their electronic properties. The calculated results show that the catalytic activity of zirconia for ORR is strongly dependent on the d-orbital occupation of the active zirconium atoms.

It was found that the Pd surfaces not only supply chemisorbed hydrogen required for the hydrogenation of isophorone but also be involve in the enantio-differentiating step. Moreover, it was observed for the first time that the configuration of the chiral product could be tuned by varying the size of Pd particle such that (R)-TMCH rather than (S)-TMCH was obtained over the Pd/MgO catalysts with large Pd particles. Two competitive reaction pathways during the enantioselective hydrogenation of isophorone were proposed depending on the size of Pd particle. One involves the enantioselective hydrogenation of the reaction intermediates formed on large Pd particle with size exceeding 10 nm leading to the excess formation of (R)-TMCH enantiomer, whereas the other invokes the primary hydrogenation of isophorone to racemic TMCH over Pd particle with size smaller than 4 nm, followed by the kinetic resolution process leaving the (S)-TMCH enantiomer in excess.

Our results reveal that the nanoribbons' geometrical structure and chemical termination have significant impacts on their electronic and magnetic properties. Specifically, the unpassivated armchair nanoribbons (alpha-NRs) and reconstructed zigzag nanoribbons (zz-o-RNs) are nonmagnetic indirect and direct bandgap semiconductors, respectively. Considering the magnetic interaction between the edge states, the normal and one-atom terminated zigzag nanoribbons (z-NRs) are determined to be a weak antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor. H passivation at the edge sites results in nonmagnetic and semiconducting properties of alpha-NRs, z-NRs, and zz-o-NRs. External strain has significant effects on both the band gap and the orbital characteristics of the band edge of a-NRs, zz-o-NRs and H passivated z-NRs, owing to the competition between the As p(x), p(y), and p(z) bonding/anti-bonding states. For the bare z-NRs, the tensile strain stabilizes the AFM state with enhanced magnetic moments. These versatile electronic and magnetic properties suggest possible potential of the As NRs for application in nanoelectronic devices.

The leaf stoichiometry of the dominant plant species growing on south-facing (SFS), south-west-facing (SWS), north-west-facing (NWS), and north-facing (NFS) slopes situated in the central Qilian Mountains of northwest China, was documented at the individual species, taxonomic family, and community levels. Leaf stoichiometry was species-specific, and each varied significantly. However, leaf stoichiometry for species shared by all slope aspects, the variation in stoichiometry of some species was homeostatic. Both at the family and community levels, slope aspect had a complex effect on leaf stoichiometry. Some stoichiometric variables were stable within the same slope aspect, whereas others varied under different slope aspects, suggesting that leaf stoichiometry was determined by both local-scale differences between sites and species identity. The range of variation in leaf stoichiometry showed a decreasing trend from individual species, to family, to community, indicating that a community's leaf stoichiometry cannot be derived from that of individual species or families. This suggests that research on plant response to environmental changes should focus on both the community level and the exclusive stoichiometry patterns of plants in this region.	[LI, S.

These intriguing changes are attributed to the effect of atomic coordination imperfection. An analytical solution has been derived showing that the maximal strain of a metallic bond in a MC under tensile stress varies inapparently with the mechanical stress but apparently with temperature in the form of exp[A/(T-m - 4.2T)], where A is a constant and T-m is the bulk melting point. Matching calculations to all the insofar-measured breaking limits (at 4 K, it is around 0.23 nm, and in the vicinity of room temperature, it is 0.29-0.48 nm) indicates that the measured divergent values originate from thermal and mechanical fluctuation near the melting point of the MC.

Boric acid, acting as a curing agent, catalyzed the self polymerization of the silane in SN, and induced phase separation in the cured SNBA systems. Thermal stability was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In air, the maximum decomposition rate (Dmax) decreased about 2%/min and the residual weight at 900 degrees C (R-900) increased 16.7% after the introduction of boron and silicon. Oxyacetylene flame ablation also confirmed the improved ablative properties of the hybrids. The flame retardancy was studied by cone calorimeter. The total heat release (THR), the total smoke produce (TSP) and the rate of mass loss (RML) were decreased after the modification. The structure of the oxidized resin was characterized to study the mechanism of the improved thermal stability and flame retardancy. The oxide compounds of silicon and boron were formed during high temperature oxidation, which consumed some oxygen and hindered the permeation of heat and oxygen, protecting the matrix from thermal oxidation.

Studying its evapotranspiration (ET) and crop coefficient (K-c) is important for managing water-saving irrigation in the region. Eddy covariance (EC) was applied to measure spring maize ET in 2007 in northwest China, focusing on the characteristics of the maize ET and K-c processes under plastic mulch. An interesting result was that a higher K-c in this study relative to the value of FAO 56 was presented in the mid and late season, e.g. average K-c was 1.46, 1.39 and 1.22 during the heading, filling and maturity stage, respectively. This result was mainly due to that (1) the plastic mulch had an effect on anti-senescence of maize and great green leaf still existed before the harvest; (2) the FAO 56 PM model may underestimate the reference crop ET in the mid and late season of maize in the region; (3) the planting density was higher in the study, which was about 374,800 plants ha (1). Though K-c during the mid and late season was high, a high water use efficiency of 25.2 kg ha (1) mm (1) was still obtained in the study. our study confirmed that plastic mulch has beneficial effect on improving maize water use efficiency in this severe water shortage region of northwest China.

The model was described and constructed from a simply supported nanoscale subminiature belt with a pulsating speed. The modified nonlocal theory was developed and an effective nonlocal bending moment instead of the classical bending moment was introduced in the problem model. The weak visco-elasticity property was adopted to constitute the material of nanostructures and a partial differential equation was derived from the d'Alembert principle. Subsequently, the Galerkin method was employed to truncate the governing partial differential equation into a set of ordinary differential equations. The first mode subharmonic resonance was analyzed and discussed in detail. Effects of multiple variables including the weak visco-elastic damping, small scale parameter, initial axial traction and the steady component of axial velocity on the instable zones of the subharmonic resonance were presented, respectively. It is found that both the visco-elastic damping and small scale parameter cause the instable zones to decrease. Vibration frequency of such accelerating system based on the modified nonlocal continuum theory is higher than that predicted by the corresponding classical elasticity mechanics. Results summarized in the present study are consistent with some previous conclusions "the stiffness of nanostructures is enhanced" and "smaller is stiffer" derived in the effective nonlocal theory.

An analytical model was employed to predict the structural compressive response and failure types. A theoretical calculation was performed to obtain the most efficient material utilization of the 2-D lattice core. A flatwise compressive experiment was performed to verify the theoretical conclusions. A comparison of theoretical and experimental results showed good agreement for structural compressive response. Results from the analytical model and experiments showed that when the 2-D lattice core was designed so that R/r = 1.167 (R and r represent the core radius at the ends and in the middle), the material utilization of the 2-D lattice core improved by 13.227%, 19.068%, and 22.143% when n = 1, n = 2, and n = 3 (n represents the highest power of the core cross-section function).

CO2RR on the MoS2 supported single cobalt atom (Co/MoS2) monolayer is performed by using the first-principles simulation, and it is found that cobalt atom prefers to dispersedly anchor on MoS2 support as single atom. According to the transition state calculation for the various possible reaction pathways together with the reaction rate constants calculation, the preferable CO2RR pathway is the reverse water gas conversion (RWGS) and CO hydrogenation pathway with the rate-limiting step of CO hydrogenation into formyl (HCO). The entire reaction pathway can be summarized as *CO2 -> *CO -> *CHO -> *CH2O -> *CH2OH and *CH3O -> CH3OH. The electronic structures analysis indicates that Co adatom induced gap states play an important role for CO2 activation and reduction. Therefore, the single cobalt atom supported on MoS2 monolayer is an efficient single atom catalyst for CO2 activation and conversion, and the current work may shed light on the development of single atom catalysts to CO2 reduction.

Metallographic microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the microstructure, texture evolution and precipitates characteristics, respectively. It is found that hot rolled sheet had a distinct stratification appearance. Fine equiaxed grains occupy the surface while subsurface and center regions were dominated by deformed microstructure and equiaxed grains. After normalizing, the microstructure of hot rolled sheet completely recrystallized. A number of shear bands were observed attributed to cold rolling. With the increase of annealing temperature or time, the average grain size of final annealed sheet increases. Annealed at 1000 degrees C for 7 min, annealed sheet exhibits highest and lowest fraction of {001} cube texture and {112} copper texture, respectively. The average grain size of final sheet also reaches peak, and it is 117.65 mu m. In addition, the fine precipitates mainly include spherical MnS, CuS, regular hexahedral AlN, TiN and partly approximate spherical composite precipitates. The average size and distribution density are 132.10 nm and 1.62 x 10(12) cm(-3), respectively. Under the condition annealed at 1000 degrees C for 7 min, the core loss P-1.5/50 is 2.461 W center dot Kg(-1) and the magnetic induction B-50 is 1.699 T.

In this hierarchical nanocomposite, TiO2 nanowires served as an effective backbone for the nucleation and growth of few layered MoS2 nanosheets. Both glucose and the roughness of anatase-TiO2 (B) nanowires played important roles in the formation of the uniform TiO2 nanowire@MoS2 nanosheet (<= 6 layers) nanocomposite. A synergistic effect was demonstrated on the nanocomposite of the TiO2 nanowire@MoS2 nanosheet. The one-dimensional robust TiO2 nanowire backbone provided a shortened and efficient pathway for electron and lithium ion transport and minimized the strain of the volume changes, while ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets offered high electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact areas, promoted rapid charge transfer and contributed to a high specific capacity. The favourable synergistic effect led to enhanced specific capacity, good cycling stability and superior rate capability of the nanocomposite, compared with either individual component. Such a TiO2 nanowire@ MoS2 nanosheet nanocomposite is a promising anode material for high performance lithium ion batteries.

Commercial Scale Uniform Powder Coating for Metal Additive Manufacturing	JOM			English	Article							CARBON NANOTUBES; LASER; ALUMINUM; MICROSTRUCTURE; STRATEGY	Three-dimensional printing of high laser reflectivity metals and metal matrix composites continues to be a challenge because of loss of laser energy and lack of high-quality composite powders. Modifying powders to enhance the interaction between laser and powder and improve the uniformity of reinforcement is a possible solution. However, traditional powder mixing methods such as ball milling destroy the spherical nature of powders. We report here commercial-scale coating of powder by electroless plating for high laser-reflectivity metals and fluidized bed chemical vapor deposition (FBCVD) for composite powders without changing the sphericity. The results indicated that coating high-laser-absorptivity Co and Ni on Al powder enhances the printability leading to good physical and mechanical properties. Similarly, the composite powder made by FBCVD had a good combination of uniformity, sphericity and flowability, which also exhibited improved printability and excellent mechanical properties for the printed bulk composites.

Thus, a novel Si@ rGO/g-C3N4 hybrid with a 3D porous sandwiched architecture, where silicon nanoparticles are anchored uniformly onto a rGO/g-C3N4 hybrid matrix via interface chemical bonding, is synthesized by a facile combined method of template-free self-assembly and heat-treatment. This sandwiched Si@ rGO/g-C3N4 hybrid anode material exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1354.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and an ultra-long cycle life of 1000 cycles at 0.5C. A capacity loss of only 0.019% per cycle at 0.5C is achieved with a coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, even after 1000 cycles. The outstanding cycling performance could be attributed to the interface bonding between the surface Si NPs (silicon nanoparticles) and N-doped rGO/g-C3N4, which not only creates inert domains for controllable lithium ion intercalation, but also configures a relatively stable mechanical structure on cycling. The reported approach provides a viable strategy to synthesise ultra-long-life silicon anode materials.

Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were performed in this work to evaluate the separation performance of MOFs at low (vacuum swing adsorption) and high (pressure swing adsorption) pressures, respectively. Simulation results demonstrated that CO2 working capacity of the unfunctionalized MOFs generally exhibits pore-size dependence at 1 bar, which increases with the decrease in pore sizes. It was also found that-NH2 functionalized MOFs exhibit the highest CO2 uptake due to the enhanced Coulombic interactions between the polar-NH2 groups and the quadrupole moment of CO2 molecules, which is followed by -CH3 and -F functionalized ones. Moreover, positioning the functional groups -NH2 and -CH3 at sites far from the metal node (site b) exhibits more significant enhancement on CO2/CH4 separation performance compared to that adjacent to the metal node (site a).

The ablation properties of the ceramics in the parallel and the perpendicular directions were studied using an oxyacetylene torch. The mass ablation rates were 8.1 +/- 0.4 mg/s in the parallel direction and 0.2 +/- 0.1 mg/s in the perpendicular direction. The linear ablation rates were 3.1 +/- 0.2 mu m/s in the parallel direction and 1.2 +/- 0.1 Am/s in the perpendicular direction. Thus, the ablation resistance of the laminated Graphite/ZrB2-SiC ceramics in the perpendicular direction was higher than that in the parallel direction. This anisotropy was mainly attributed to the lower surface temperature in the perpendicular direction resulted from higher thermal conductivity, as well as the orientation of the weak graphite interface layer perpendicular to the ablation surface.

Seeking novel high-performing adsorbents of AHPs is the key to improve their cooling/heating performance. Very recently, the potential use of covalent-organic frameworks (C0Fs) adsorbents of AHPs has won increasing research interests. However, the adsorption cooling/heating performance of COFs under varying working conditions is still unexplored. In this study, COF-5 was synthesized and tested to obtain the adsorption isotherms of ethanol working fluid. For comparison, three commonly used metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), including Cu-BTC, MIL-101(Cr), and ZIF-8, were also investigated. The cooling/heating performance of COF-5/ethanol and MOF/ethanol working pairs was evaluated by mathematical modelling based on the basic thermodynamic cycle of AHPs. The results demonstrated that COF-5 with the high coefficient of performance for cooling/heating (COPC/COPH) under wide temperature lift (Delta T-lift) outperformed MOFs, especially for cooling.

Then the as-prepared Srp@Fe3O4/OA particles were firstly mixed with bismaleimide resin (BMI) to constructe a series of Srp@Fe3O4/OA/BMI composites, the mechanical properties, tribological properties and thermal stability of the Srp@Fe3O4/OA/BMI composites are subsequently investigated. The characterization results indicate that the 0.3 wt% Srp@Fe3O4/OA/BMI composite shows the maximum impact strength (19.0 kJ.m(-2)) and minimum friction coefficient (0.21), higher 52.7% and lower 55% than those of the neat BMI resin, respectively. The significantly enhanced toughness and tribological performance of the Srp@Fe3O4/OA/BMI composites are mainly due to the increase of the free volume and the uniformly distribution of Srp@Fe3O4/OA, as well as the good interfacial adhesion between BMI matrix and Srp@Fe3O4/OA particles.

Detection of promoter hypermethylation of cancer-related genes may be useful for cancer diagnosis or the detection of recurrence. p16, an inhibitor of the cyclin D-dependent protein kinases, is a classical tumor suppressor gene, and its inactivation is closely associated with carcinogenesis. p16 hypermethylation could be detected in each stage, which is consistent with the finding that aberrant methylation of p16 is a very early event in carcinogenesis. We have developed an electrochemical procedure for detecting DNA methylation of the human p16(Ink4a) gene. The procedure is based on the coupling of DNA electrochemical sensors with linker-PCR- amplified DNA from human gastric tumor tissue and whole blood cells of healthy human. The synthesized oligonucleotide was immobilized on the modified gold electrode to fabricate a DNA biosensor. The hybridization reaction on the electrode surface was monitored by cyclic voltammogram (CV) and square wave voltammogram (SWV), using [Co(phen)(3)](ClO4)(3) as a redox indicator. Methylation status of human p16(Ink4a) gene was detected and the results were validated by bisulfite DNA sequencing. A good reproducibility was observed in several parallel experiments. The coupling of DNA electrochemical sensors with PCR allowed quick detection and have the potential of the quantitative evaluation of the methylation status of the human p16(Ink4a) gene.

We present a systematic study on the geometry, embedded adsorption energy and electronic structure of four different adatoms adsorbed on the GDY. The strong interaction between the NM adatoms and the GDY substrate is found with the NM embedded in the 18C-hexagon of the GDY. We investigated the mobility of the NM adatoms on the GDY, and found that the mobility barrier energy increases along with the increasing of the embedded adsorption energy. We present the NM adatoms growth of high concentrations on the GDY. Upon the analysis of the electronic structure and the frontier molecular orbitals, Rh and Ir adatoms of low concentrations (about 1.37 at%) on the GDY have the potential to be applied as single metal catalysts or gas molecule sensors.

The hydrothermal process was optimized and the effects of hydrothermal condition, including reaction temperature, reaction time and the ratio of Mo source to S source (Mo:S) in precursor, on microwave absorption performances and dielectric properties were investigated. Our results showed that when the reaction temperature was 180 degrees C, the reaction time was 18 h, and the Mo:S was 1:3.5, the synthesized MoS2 had the best performance: Its minimum reflection loss could reach -55.78 dB, and the corresponding matching thickness was 2.30 mm with a wide effective bandwidth of 5.17 GHz. Further researches on the microwave absorption mechanism revealed that in addition to the destructive interference of electromagnetic waves, various polarization phenomena such as defect dipole polarization were the main reasons for microwave loss. We believe that MoS2 is a candidate for a practical microwave absorbent. (C) 2019 Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Hidden Confinement Induced by Charged Excitons: External Electric Field Adjustment to Achieve Highly Efficient Fluorescence in PLEDs	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; CONJUGATED POLYMERS; DELAYED FLUORESCENCE; TRANSPORT LAYER; GRAPHENE OXIDE; HOLE TRANSPORT; DEVICES; ELECTROLUMINESCENCE; DISSOCIATION; POLARON	Experiments have shown that intensive charge injections are able to greatly enhance the efficiency of polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs). Yet, under strong external electric filed/high voltages, there is a certain degree of efficiency roll-off. For this paradox, this article reveals the following underlying mechanism: Under a low electric field, a charged polaron is driven to the potential well created by an exciton, where they fuse together to form a "charged exciton". The carrier fusion induces the triplet state to fluoresce, which greatly enhances the performance of the device (ideally, the internal quantum efficiency can exceed 95%). As long as the external field continues to increase and surpasses 4.5 x 10(4)V/cm, the above confinement is broken, and the polaron also steps out of the potential well, which leads to a major setback of the overall device efficiency. Then, when the electric field reaches as high as 0.8 MV/cm, the original exciton is dissociated. For achieving highly efficient fluorescent PLEDs, it is seen that the appropriate electric field magnitude ranges from 5 x 10(2) to 2 x 10(4) V/cm.

Coexistence of induced superconductivity and quantum Hall states in InSb nanosheets	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							ENERGY-GAP STRUCTURE; ANDREEV REFLECTION; SEMICONDUCTOR; CONDUCTANCE; GRAPHENE; SUPERCURRENT; JUNCTION	Hybrid superconducting devices based on high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases with strong spin-orbit coupling are considered to offer a flexible and scalable platform for topological quantum computation. Here, we report the realization and electrical characterization of hybrid devices based on high-quality InSb nanosheets and superconducting niobium (Nb) electrodes. In these hybrid devices, we observe gate-tunable proximity-induced supercurrent and multiple Andreev reflections, indicating a transparent Nb-InSb nanosheet interface. The high critical magnetic field of Nb combined with high-mobility InSb nanosheets allows us to exploit the transport properties in the exotic regime where the superconducting proximity effect coexists with the quantum Hall effect. Transport spectroscopy measurements in such a regime reveal an enhancement of the conductance at the quantum Hall plateaus, accompanied by a pronounced zero-bias peak in the differential conductance. We discuss that these features originate from the formation of Andreev edge states at the superconductor-InSb nanosheet interface in the quantum Hall regime. In addition to shedding light on the interplay between superconductivity and quantum Hall effect, our work opens a new possibility to develop hybrid superconducting devices based on 2D semiconductor nanosheets with strong spin-orbit coupling.

Comparison of Two Methods for Determination of Soil Fixed Ammonium	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						Fixed NH4; hydrofluoric acid; Mogilevkina method; Silva-Bremner method	ISOTOPE-RATIO ANALYSIS; EXCHANGEABLE AMMONIUM; ORGANIC NITROGEN; DIFFERENT FORMS; FIXATION; CLAY; RELEASE; EXTRACTION; CARBON	Twenty-four soils were sampled from northwestern China to study the relations of fixed or nonexchangeable ammonium (NH4) determined by the widely used Silva-Bremner method and the simplest ignition Mogilevkina method with organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (N), and soil particle composition. Results showed that the averaged values of 24 soils determined by the Silva-Bremner method were 10.7% greater than those using the Mogilevkina method, and the standard deviations of the Mogilevkina method were larger than those of the Silva-Bremner method. There was a close correlation in the fixed NH4 between the two methods (R-2=0.7831, n=24). The low values obtained by the Mogilevkina method were not due to the heat treatment because there was almost no difference in results between heating for 44 and 72 h. Soil OM had no correlation with the fixed NH4 amounts determined by the two methods due to self-correlations, but total N had significantly weak correlations. The soils sampled from northwestern China were dominant in the 2:1 type of clay minerals, and significant correlations were found for the fixed NH4 amounts determined by the two methods with clay as well as with clay plus silt contents. Correlations (R-2) of the fixed NH4 by the Silva-Bremner method were 0.4545 and 0.3145 with clay and clay plus silt contents, respectively, for the initial soils and 0.4765 and 0.446, respectively, for soils after ryegrass planting, which were much greater than those of the Mogilevkina method. Based on the definition of fixed NH4 and the problem that occurred during its determination, two criteria were proposed for evaluation of the methods: (1) the relationship between clay content or clay plus silt contents and fixed NH4 and (2) the correlation of OM content with fixed NH4. By these criteria, the Silva-Bremner method was superior to the Mogilevkina method in terms of reliability and accuracy.	[Li, S. X.; Tian, X. H.; Wang, Z.

Characterization of the catalyst structure, composition, and morphology was performed by XRD, EDX, TEM, and SEM. In addition, the results showed that Ni-B presents as amorphous nanoparticles. The particle diameters ranged from 22 to 25 nm. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) tests proved that Ni-B has better electrocatalytic activity and higher stability towards KBH4 oxidation compared to a pure Ni catalyst. A single cell was assembled with a Ni-B anode and a LaNi0.9Ru0.1O3 cathode. A peak power density of 180 mW cm(-2) was achieved at room temperature. In addition, the fuel utilization rate was approximately 41% at a constant current density of 200 mA cm(-2), illustrating that some BH4 (-) hydrolysis occurs on the Ni-B surface. Finally, the cell had no attenuation after 180 h test, showing good stability.

The microfluidic origami device was fabricated by directly screen-printed electrodes on wax-patterned cellulose paper in bulk. The Ag-PWE was fabricated by a seed-mediated growth approach and served as an effective matrix for antibody attachment with good bioactivity, and stability. The ECL nanoprobe (Ab2RD5/NPS) was designed by covalent assembly of signal antibodies (Ab(2)) on QDs/NPS. After a sandwich immunoreaction, the functionalized NPS labels were captured onto the Ag-PWE surface. On the basis of the considerably amplified ECL signal and sandwich-type format, the proposed method successfully fulfilled the highly sensitive detection of CEA with a linear range of 0.5 pg mL(-1) to 20 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.12 pg mL(-1). This facile origami ECL immunodevice exhibited high sensitivity, specificity and excellent performance in real human serum assay, and could be applied in point-of-care testing of other tumor markers for remote regions and developing countries.

However, the potential effect of SOM content on soil resistome remains unclear. Here, a soil microcosm experiment was established to explore the temporal succession of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities in three black soils with distinct difference in SOM contents following application of poultry manure using high-throughput qPCR (HT-qPCR) and MiSeq sequencing. A total of 151 ARGs and 8 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected across all samples. Relative abundance of ARGs negatively correlated with SOM content. Manure-derived ARGs had much higher diversity and absolute abundance in the low SOM soils. The ARG composition and bacterial community structure were significantly different in three soils. A random forest model showed that SOM content was a better predictor of ARG pattern than bacterial diversity and abundance. Structural equation modeling indicated that the negative effects of SOM content on ARG patterns was accomplished by the shift of bacterial communities such as the bacterial diversity and abundance. Our study demonstrated that SOM content could play an important role in the dissemination of ARGs originated from animal manures, these findings provide a possible strategy for the suppression of the spread of ARGs in black soils by increasing SOM content.

The structure had been characterized by IR spectra and NMR spectra. Dicyclopentadiene bisphenol dicyanate ester (DCPDCE) composites were then prepared using P-POSS and E-POSS respectively. Their effect on the curing kinetics, dielectric, mechanical, flame-retardant and thermal properties and water absorption of the resulting composites were investigated. The results suggested that the addition of modified POSS could facilitate the curing reaction of DCPDCE. Besides, the DCPDCE composites containing modified FOSS exhibited excellent flame-retardant property over pure DCPDCE resin. Adding only a little amount as small as 1.5 wt% P-POSS or 2.5 wt% E-POSS could change the UL-94V of DCPDCE resin from V-2 to V-0. The composite with P-POSS exhibited better flame-retardant and thermal properties than the composite with E-POSS. However, composite filled with E-POSS presented better dielectric property and lower water absorption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Microstructure of room temperature ionic liquids at stepped graphite electrodes	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						electrical double layer; interfacial microstructure; room temperature ionic liquids; graphite electrode; energy storage	CARBON SUPERCAPACITORS; MOLECULAR INSIGHTS; DOUBLE-LAYER; CAPACITANCE; SIMULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; INTERFACE; DYNAMICS; EWALD	Molecular dynamics simulations of room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) [emim][TFSI] at stepped graphite electrodes were performed to investigate the influence of the thickness of the electrode surface step on the microstructure of interfacial RTILs. A strong correlation was observed between the interfacial RTIL structure and the step thickness in electrode surface as well as the ion size. Specifically, when the step thickness is commensurate with ion size, the interfacial layering of cation/anion is more evident; whereas, the layering tends to be less defined when the step thickness is close to the half of ion size. Furthermore, two-dimensional microstructure of ion layers exhibits different patterns and alignments of counterion/co-ion lattice at neutral and charged electrodes. As the cation/anion layering could impose considerable effects on ion diffusion, the detailed information of interfacial RTILs at stepped graphite presented here would help to understand the molecular mechanism of RTIL-electrode interfaces in supercapacitors.

Therefore, it is important to develop simple, fast and sensitive characterization methods to visualize grain boundaries. Conventional Raman and photoluminescence methods have been used for detecting grain boundaries; however, these techniques are better suited for detection of grain boundaries with a large crystal axis rotation between neighbouring grains. Here we show rapid visualization of grain boundaries in chemical vapour deposited monolayer MoS2 samples with multiphoton microscopy. In contrast to Raman and photoluminescence imaging, third-harmonic generation microscopy provides excellent sensitivity and high speed for grain boundary visualization regardless of the degree of crystal axis rotation. We find that the contrast associated with grain boundaries in the third-harmonic imaging is considerably enhanced by the solvents commonly used in the transfer process of two-dimensional materials. Our results demonstrate that multiphoton imaging can be used for fast and sensitive characterization of two-dimensional materials.

Changes in the ionic chemistry of the outlet solution, combined with core scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and bulk-rock X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the core pre- and post-experiment reveal new insights into CO2-brine-rock interactions. Minerals such as potassium (K) feldspar, albite, calcite, and ankerite are variably dissolved after the experiments. Calcite is the mineral most affected by dissolution, followed by ankerite, whereas dissolution of feldspar minerals is minimal. Small amounts of kaolinite and solid phases were generated as a result of the experiment The solid phases are mainly comprised of C, O, Na, Cl, Al, and Si, and are presumed to be the transitional products in the formation of carbonate minerals. The very low fluid penetration rate in the experiment resulted in significantly reduced Contact area between the acidic CO2 fluid and minerals in the cores, resulting in low rates of feldspar dissolution. Core permeability decreased substantially throughout the experiment, although core porosity remained unchanged. The permeability reduction is the result of precipitation of new mineral phases (e.g., kaolinite and solid phases), and potentially also the presence of clay particles released by the dissolution of carbonate cement, which have then been transported in the fluid flow path and accumulated at pore throats. The results provide new insights into CO2 trapping mechanisms in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and into the potential formation damage that may result from massive injections of CO2 into reservoirs during enhanced oil recovery programs.

Herein, we first conceptually demonstrate the rational design of unidirectional cascade charge transfer channels over transition metal chalcogenide nanosheets (TMC NSs: ZnIn2S4, CdS, CdIn2S4, and In2S3), which is synergistically enabled by a solid-state non-conjugated polymer, i.e., poly(diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA), and MXene quantum dots (MQDs). In such elaborately designed photosystems, an ultrathin PDDA layer functions as an intermediate charge transport mediator to relay the directional electron transfer from TMC NSs to MQDs that serve as the ultimate electron traps, resulting in a considerably boosted charge separation/migration efficiency. The suitable energy level alignment between TMC NSs and MQDs, concurrent electron-withdrawing capabilities of the ultrathin PDDA interim layer and MQDs, and the charge transport cascade endow the self-assembled TMC/PDDA/MQD heterostructured photosystems with conspicuously improved photoactivities toward anaerobic selective reduction of nitroaromatics to amino derivatives and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Furthermore, we ascertain that this concept of constructing a charge transfer cascade in such TMC-insulating polymer-MQD photosystems is universal. Our work would afford novel insights into smart design of spatial vectorial charge transport pathways by precise interface modulation via non-conjugated polymers for solar energy conversion.

However, experimental measurement of the thermal conductivity of MOF crystals is of great challenge due to its small size. Herein, we proposed a general method to obtain the thermal conductivity of MOF crystal using MOF powder sample. By measuring the thermal conductivity of compacted MOF powders at varying water contents using transient hot-wire method, the thermal conductivity of MOF crystal can be derived by a biporous effective medium approximation (BEMA) model. The eventually obtained thermal conductivities of three different MOF crystals: UiO-66, UiO-67 and Cu-BTC, are 0.11 W/(m.K), 0.19 W/(m.K), and 0.39 W/(m.K), respectively, consistent with previously reported results of MOF crystals.

In this study, highly hydrophilic three-demensional (3D) porous CS-grafted beta-CD (CS-g-beta-CD) was prepared through the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with epichlorohydrin (ECH) as the crosslinker and the consequent nucleophilic reaction between the epoxide ring of ECH and the primary amine of CS, which was then characterized by H-1 nuclear (H-1 NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermogravimetry (TG), and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. When etoposide (VP16), an anti-cancer drug, was encapsulated in the CS-g-beta-CD, the encapsulation ratio was up to 73.6%. Finally, the resultant CS-g-beta-CD was successfully used as the responsive drug carrier for pH- and thermo-sensitive release of VP16. This work opens a new avenue for the preparation of stimuli-responsive drug carriers with modified natural polysaccharides. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

And, the influence of nickel citrate on the flame retardance of TPU/APP composites was investigated by cone calorimeter test (CCT), thermogravimetric analysis/infrared spectrometry (TG-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-Ms), and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), respectively. It has been found the combination of NC and APP improved the flame retardancy and reduced the total heat release (THR) of TPU composites. The THR value of TPU/APP/NC0.5 was reduced by 20.7% at 750 s compared with that of TPU/APP. The flame retardancy of TPU composites and the graphitization degree of char residue from TPU composites were improved by the combination of both NC and APP. This work provided a new way to improve the flame retardancy of polymer composites.	[Chen, X. L.; Wang, K.; Gu, Y. X.; Jiao, C. M.; Li, S.

However, current studies on pressure-sensitive papers have not fully utilized the unique advantages of papers, such as printability, cuttability, and foldability. Moreover, the existing resistive, capacitive, and triboelectric sensing modalities have long-standing challenges in sensitivity, noise-proofing, response time, linearity, etc. Here, a novel flexible iontronic sensing mechanism, referred to as iontronic sensing paper (ISP), is introduced to the classic paper substrates by incorporating both ionic and conductive patterns into an all-in-one flexible sensing platform. The ISP can then be structured into 2D or 3D tactile-sensitive origamis only by the paper-specific manipulations of printing, cutting, folding, and gluing. Notably, the ISP device possesses a device sensitivity of 10 nF kPa(-1) cm(-2), which is thousands of times higher than that of the commercial counterpart, a resolution of 6.25 Pa, a single-millisecond response time, and a high linearity (R-2 > 0.996). Benefiting from the unique properties of the fibrous paper structures and its remarkable performances, the ISP devices hold enormous potential for the emerging human-machine interfaces, including smart packaging, health wearables, and pressure-sensitive paper matrix.

Herein, we fabricated C-doped ZnO ball-in-ball hollow microspheres (BHMs) by a facile solvothermal treatment of zinc acetate in ethylene glycol-ethanol mixture. The presence of ethylene glycol (EG) leads to the formation of initial single-layered hollow spheres and then a time-dependent evolution transforms them into uniform BHMs with tunable shell thickness and void space. XPS characterizations reveal that C-dopants are introduced into the lattice of ZnO BHMs, with its concentration increasing with solvothermal time and then becoming saturated in 12 h. ZEG-12 (ZnO BHMs with 12-h solvothermal treatment), with an optimal hollow structure and C-doping concentration, performs the best optical absorption capability, efficiency of charge separation and transfer, and mass transfer in reaction media, as proved by SEM, TEM, PL, BET and EIS characterizations. When applied as photocatalyst for organic-pollutant degradation and as photoanode material for PEC water splitting, ZEG-12 exhibits respectively ca. 8.9-fold and 10.5-fold higher activity than pristine ZnO nanoparticles.

Impact Behavior of Polyetheretherketone/Nickel Foam Co-continuous Composites	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						co-continuous phase composites; Impact behavior; Nickel foam; PEEK	LOW-VELOCITY IMPACT; FRACTURE-TOUGHNESS; CARBON; STRENGTH; ENERGY	In this study, we prepared eight types of polyetheretherketone/nickel (PEEK/Ni) foam co-continuous phase composites (named "PEEK-Nis") in which virgin PEEK was infiltrated into homologous hollow Ni structures by using hot pressing. Their Charpy impact behavior was investigated in accordance with ISO: 179-1, and the effect of the structure of the foam Ni on the impact properties of the PEEK-Nis was also studied. Compared with unfilled PEEK, the Ni prisms can effectively disperse, transfer, and absorb the energy of the pendulum, further improve the impact toughness of the PEEK-Nis and eventually lead to different fracture modes. The impact toughness of PEEK-Nis was mainly affected by Ni volume fraction, coating thickness, and pores per inch (PPI) value, which are mutually restricted. When the Ni content was less than 8.5%, the impact toughness of PEEK-Nis increased with an increase in PPI value. When the Ni content was between 8.5 and 18%, the impact toughness of PEEK-Nis increased with the coating thickness. When the Ni content exceeded 18%, the impact toughness decreased dramatically possibly because of the mechanical mismatch of the two-phase materials in PEEK-Nis. For further optimization, PEEK-NiB-2 was fabricated and had the most reasonable structure of the reinforcing phase. Among all PEEK-Nis, PEEK-NiB-2 exhibited the best impact toughness, with a value over two times that of unfilled PEEK.	[Yang, X. G.; Zhang, H.

The best preparation ratios with Bi2S3 mass were 4% and 1% for DCF and IBU removal respectively, which might be attributed to better crystallinities of (0 0 1) and (1 1 0) facets respectively. Besides, enhanced charge separation and better crystallinity with introduction of Fe3O4 and Bi2S3 promoted higher photocatalytic performance of Fe3O4/Bi2S3/BiOBr compared with pure BiOBr, Bi2S3 and Bi2S3/BiOBr. Influencing factors experiments (pH, common anions, DOM) results showed beneficial or detrimental effects to a certain extent. While removal efficiencies in matrices of Yellow River (DCF: 55.65%; IBU: 54.90%) and Wastewater treatment plant (DCF: 68.66%; IBU: 58.90%) exhibited lower than those in ultrapure water. Moreover, h+ and e-played the uppermost roles in the DCF and IBU photodegradation according to active species trapping experiment results. Furthermore, four and two main degradation pathways for DCF and IBU removal respectively through 3D EEMs and HRMS analyses were proposed. Lastly, easy separation from water and excellent reusability proved its better potential for emerging pollutants removal in environment remediation area.

Our results show that BPQDs exhibit significant nonlinear absorption in the visible range, but saturable absorption in the near-infrared range under femtosecond excitation. The calculated nonlinear absorption coefficients were found to be (7.49 +/- 0.23) x 10(-3), (1.68 +/- 0.078) x 10(-3) and (0.81 +/- 0.03) x 10(-3) cm/GW for 500, 700 and 900 nm, respectively. Femtosecond pump-probe measurements performed on BPQDs revealed that two-photon absorption is responsible for the observed nonlinear absorption. The saturable absorption behaviors observed at 1050, 1350 and 1550 nm are due to ground-state bleaching induced by photo-excitation. Our results suggest that BPQDs have great potential in applications as broadband optical limiters in the visible range or saturable absorbers in the near-infrared range for ultrafast laser pulses. These ultrasmall BPQDs are potentially useful as broadband optical elements in ultrafast photonics devices.

The results showed that the iridium coating had a much higher thermal response than the Ir-Al coating in non-equilibrium conditions. The iridium coating melted at a heat flux of 2.03 MW/m(2) with the surface temperature up to 2494 degrees C, while the surface temperature of the Ir-Al coating was only 1330 degrees C at this condition. When the heat flux rose to 3 MW/m(2), the surface temperature of the Ir-Al coating stayed at similar to 1520 degrees C. After continuous ablation at this condition for 500 s, the Ir-Al coating remained intact. It can be concluded that the Al alloying modification could largely improve the ablation resistance of an iridium coating. The present research proposed a novel idea for ultra-high temperature coating for hypersonic applications.

The sensors are assembled from hybrid core-shell nanofibers with electrospun poly (acrylonitrile) nanofibers as the mechanical core and thin polyaniline shells as the moisture sensing material, respectively. The polyaniline shells are coated on the electrospun nanofibers via in situ polymerization. The sensors are sensitive to moisture breathed out from both mouth and nose; and their response is determined by the loading and morphology of polyaniline as well as the amount of moisture. In combination with high porosity and mechanical flexibility, the sensors can be readily integrated with textiles to fabricate wearable electronics.

Remote sensing provides broad, precise, impartial, and easily available information for quantifying the location, extent, and variability of change; the causes and processes of change; and the responses to and consequences of change. This chapter describes how remote sensing data products are used to map the extent of three major land use types (with focus on urban, forest, and agricultural land), detect changes in these land-use types, and evaluate the environmental impacts resulting from these land use changes.

Highly Efficient CdS/WO3 Photocatalysts: Z-Scheme Photocatalytic Mechanism for Their Enhanced Photocatalytic H-2 Evolution under Visible Light	ACS CATALYSIS			English	Article						CdS; photocatalytic H-2 evolution; Z-scheme; surface photovoltage; photogenerated charge transfer; WO3	CHARGE-TRANSFER PROPERTIES; REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; SOLID-STATE; WATER; GENERATION; CDS; PERFORMANCE; IRRADIATION; SYSTEM	Natural photosynthesis is usually recognized as an efficient mechanism to achieve solar energy conversion. We construct a CdS/WO3 nanojunction achieving a Z-scheme for clean hydrogen fuel evolution by 6 mimicking the natural photosynthesis. Although WO3 alone cannot be used for H2 evolution from water splitting, it can significantly increase the H-2 evolution & activity of CdS through a Z-scheme mechanism with lactate as electron donor. I The CdS/WO3 photocatalyst has a high H-2 evolution rate of 369 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) at a CdS concentration of 20 wt %, which is 5 times as high as that of CdS with it lactic acid as electron donor. For further improving the hydrogen production rate, we introduce the noble metal Pt to ameliorate the charge transport between CdS and WO3. Good H-2 evolution rates up to 2900 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) were obtained with WPC3, which is about 7.9 times the rate of WC20 with visible radiation. The interesting thing is that the photocatalytic mechanism of CdS/WO3 is different from the previously reported mechanism. The results of TPV (transient photovoltage) and SPV (surface photovoltage) indicate that the Z-scheme system of CdS/WO3 can effectively promote charge separation and depress the charges recombining of photogenerated charge in CdS, based on the Z-scheme mechanism, resulting in efficient H-2 production activity under visible light.

In our work, we initially prepared WTe(2)QDs and combined them with NiSe/C nanowires (WTe2 QDs-doped NiSe/C) by electrospinning method and high temperature selenization process. The WTe(2)QDs-doped NiSe/C composite structures were flexible and free-standing, which can be used as electrode directly assembled into Li-ion battery. It displays a great reversible lithium storage ability (with similar to 620 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 1 A/g over 500 cycles) and good rate capability.

The prepared Fe-Hdap complexes were heat-treated at 600, 700, 800 and 900 degrees C to optimize their activity for ORR. It was found that the 800 degrees C heat-treatment yielded the most active Fe-N-x/C catalyst. Fe-N-x/C catalyst with several Fe loadings(3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, mass fraction) were also synthesized and a 5% Fe loading yielded the best catalytic ORR activity. XRD, TG, TEM, XPS and line-scan voltammograms techniques were used to characterize the structural changes in these catalyst after heat-treatment, including the catalyst composition, structure, morphologe and the electrochemical activity. As observed by XRD, when the heat-treatment temperature or Fe content was too high, Fe3O4 could be produced. This would lead to a decrease in ORR activity. XPS analysis revealed that the catalyst surface consisted of 0.61% (mass fraction) N(largely pyrrolic-like). The ORR activities of catalysts synthesized using ligands with different structures were studied. The result indicated that the catalyst prepared using the compound containing more pyridinic N as ligand had enhanced activity, and the S element in ligand can improve the activity of Fe-N-x/C catalyst. The stability of the Fe-N-x/C catalyst in the voltage region having ORR kinetic limiting was tested by fixing a electrode potential to record the change in current density with time. The obtained degradation rates for this catalyst is 0.0048 mA/(cm(2) . h).

The HOOH from the hydrogenation of the OOH species could be further hydrogenated into OH and H2O, and the OH would be finally hydrogenated into the (second) H2O. The reaction barrier of rate-determining step is 1.02 eV. Moreover, the presented kinetic processes are confirmed by the thermodynamic simulation from Gibbs free energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. These results indicate that phosphorene as one of new 2D materials could be a promising metal free cathode material for PEMFC.

In these components Schottky diodes provide a low forward voltage and a very fast switching rate but suffer the drawback of a high reverse leakage current. Improvement of the reverse bias characteristics without degrading performance of the diode at positive voltages is deemed physically impossible for conventional silicon-based Schottky diodes. However, in this work we propose that this design challenge can be overcome in the organic-based diodes by utilizing reversible transitions between distinct adsorption states of organic molecules on metal surfaces. Motivated by previous experimental observations of controllable adsorption conformations of anthradithiophene on Cu(111), herein we use density functional theory simulations to demonstrate the distinct Schottky barrier heights of the two adsorption states. The higher Schottky barrier of the reverse bias induced by a chemisorbed state results in low leakage current, while the lower barrier of the forward bias induced by a physisorbed state yields a larger output current. The rectifying behaviors are further supported by nonequilibrium Green's function transport calculations.

Fe3O4/HKUST-1 was thoroughly characterized, and the major influence factors including solution pH, adsorbent amount and salt concentration were investigated. Compared to the reported adsorbents, Fe3O4/HKUST-1 has a very high adsorption rate, and it is found that CIP and NOR could be removed within 30 min. Moreover, the maximum adsorption capacities of the magnetic composites toward CIP and NOR reached as high as 538 mg g(-1) and 513 mg g(-1), respectively, much higher than those of most of the reported adsorbents for these two FQAs. The saturation magnetization value of Fe3O4/HKUST-1 was 44 emu g(-1), which was sufficient for the separation of the Fe304/HKUST-1adsorbent from the aqueous solution by the application of an external magnetic field. Additionally, this magnetic material showed a good reusability with the adsorption capability decreasing only slightly after reuse for ten cycles. These results indicated that the magnetic composites Fe3O4/HKUST-1 may be a promising adsorbent in the decontamination of FQAs from wastewater due to its high adsorption capability, fast kinetics, easy separation from water, and excellent recyclability. The adsorption mechanism was proposed based on the effects of pH on adsorption and on the zeta potential of the adsorbent. For the adsorption of CIP and NOR by Fe3O4/HKUST-1, both electrostatic and pi-pi interactions may be important. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

High-Performance Bi2Te3-Based Topological Insulator Film Magnetic Field Detector	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						topological insulator; magnetic-field detector	SURFACE-STATES; MAGNETORESISTANCE; NANORIBBONS; SB2TE3	Topological insulators with the nanoscaled metallic surface state (3-5 nm) are actually of typical functional nanostnictures. Significant efforts have been devoted to study new families of topological insulators and identifications of topological surface state, as well as fundamental physics issues relating to spin-polarized surface electronic states in the past few years. However, transport investigations that can provide direct experimental evidence for potentially practical applications of topological insulators are limited, and realization of functional devices based on topological insulators is still under exploration. Here, using the Sn-doping Bi2Te3 polycrystalline topological insulator films, we fabricated high-performance current-controlled magnetic field detectors. When a parallel magnetic field is applied, the as-fabricated device exhibits a stable and reproducible magnetoresistance (MR) switching behavior, and the corresponding MR ratio can be modulated by the applied current. Even under such a low magnetic field (0.5 kG), the device still shows a distinguishable MR switching performance, suggesting that topological insulator devices are very sensitive to external stimulation and potentially applicable to weak magnetic field detection.

However, there is limited information on the economic, energy and environmental consequences of converting conventional crop systems with intensive forage production systems. Based on 4-year field experiments, this work proposed a comprehensive assessment of the shift from maize-wheat (M-W) to forage production systems [silage maize-ryegrass (SM-R), sweet sorghum-ryegrass (SS-R), and sorghumsudangrass hybrids-ryegrass (SH-R)] from economic, energy, and environmental perspectives in the northern part of the North China Plain (NCP). The results revealed that SH-R had the highest yields of dry shoot biomass and crude protein, followed by SS-R, SM-R, and M-W. Similar trends were also found for the net return, ratio of income to costs, net energy output, energy use efficiency, and energy productivity. Furthermore, the environmental assessment through a life cycle assessment suggested that compared with the M-W, the total potential environmental impacts for the product-based indicators were reduced by 50%, 55%, and 72% in SM-R, SS-R, and SH-R, respectively, even if crop protection was based on a prophylactic approach. Thus, shifting from maizewheat to forage rotation systems, especially the sorghum-sudangrass hybrids-ryegrass system, may be promising for forage production in the northern part of the NCP. This work provides valuable insight into forage production system design and environmental change adaptation for improving food security and achieving green/circular economy.

Here, a highly sensitive flexible sensor array based on piezoelectricity-enhanced vertically aligned P(VDF-TrFE) micropillars is developed for dynamic tactile sensing. The core piezoelectric sensing micropillars are fabricated using a straightforward and scalable nanoimprinting technology and then sandwiched between a pair of cross electrode arrays to construct multiplexed sensor arrays. Due to the proposed structural design and nanoimprinting methodology, the sensor pixels exhibit uniform output generation, robust output stability, and scalable fabrication ability. In addition, taking advantage of the high compressibility and enhanced strain of the piezoelectric micropillars compared to planar films, the microstructured sensors show an enhanced sensitivity of 228.2 mV N-1 and a highly linear response to loads. By integrating the flexible sensor with a portable signal processing circuit, a complete tactile sensing system is successfully developed to provide clear intuitive user interfaces. The good flexibility and robust stability of the sensor arrays enable them to be attached onto curved surface for real-time tracking of dynamic force and imaging the force distribution.

Synthesis of Surface Grown Pt Nanoparticles on Edge-Enriched MoS2 Porous Thin Films for Enhancing Electrochemical Performance	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							HYDROGEN EVOLUTION REACTION; GRAPHENE-LIKE MOS2; PLATINUM NANOPARTICLES; COMPOSITE COATINGS; ATOMIC-SCALE; LAYERED MOS2; CATALYST; NANOSHEETS; MONOLAYER; EFFICIENT	A hybrid catalyst, Pt nanocrystals deposited on the surface of MoS2 vertically standing nanoplatelets, is synthesized via chemical vapor deposition and subsequent thermal annealing (TA) of Pt precursor. The hybrid material shows promising results as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By varying Pt synthesis conditions-precursor loading and TA temperature-the deposition sites, size, and morphology of the Pt nanostructure can be controlled. The size effect of a Pt nanoparticle on catalytic activity and sintering resistance is discussed. Results show that higher Pt loading yields better HER performance despite smaller specific surface area; higher TA temperature delivers larger average particle size of Pt crystals and lower HER activity. Larger average size leads to fast sintering and thus poor durability of the catalyst. On the basis of the correlation between HER performance and growth behaviors of Pt on MoS2 surfaces, an optimization route for a highly active and stable cocatalyst can be established. The optimized Pt-MoS2 catalyst (400 degrees C, 11 wt %) reported in this study possesses superior overpotential of 9 mV (close to zero), Tafel slope of 44 mV/dec, and moderate exchange current density of 373 mu A/cm(2); it exhibits activity degradation of 140 mV @ 20 mA/cm(2) after 10 000 cycles. The Tafel slope indicates the combination of Volmer-Heyrovsky steps as HER mechanism in this particular hybrid catalyst system. The outstanding HER activity attributes to highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles grown on MoS2 basal surfaces, large MoS2 edge density, and Pt-S bonding effect induced activity improvement of MoS2 as well as 3D porous network assisted superaerophobic surface.

J	Li, S; Jiang, F; Wei, B; Hou, J; Liu, HH				Li, Sheng; Jiang, Fei; Wei, Bei; Hou, Jian; Liu, Haihu			Prediction of three-phase relative permeabilities of Berea sandstone using lattice Boltzmann method	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS			English	Article							IMMISCIBLE 2-PHASE FLOW; POROUS-MEDIA; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; FLUIDS; CONTACT; OIL; DYNAMICS; MODELS	Three-phase flows through a pore network of Berea sandstone are studied numerically under critical interfacial tension conditions. Results show that the relative permeability of each fluid increases as its own saturation increases. The specific interfacial length between wetting and nonwetting fluids monotonously decreases with increasing the saturation of intermediate-wetting fluid, while the other two specific interfacial lengths exhibit a nonmonotonous variation. As the wetting (nonwetting) fluid becomes less wetting (nonwetting), the relative permeability of wetting fluid monotonously increases, while the other two relative permeabilities show a nonmonotonous trend. Due to the presence of a spreading layer, the specific interfacial length between wetting and nonwetting fluids always stabilizes at a low level. As the viscosity ratio of wetting (nonwetting) to intermediate-wetting fluids increases, the relative permeability of wetting (nonwetting) fluid increases. With the viscosity ratio deviating from unity, the phase interfaces become increasingly unstable, leading to an increased specific interfacial length.

Because total dissolved salts and soluble ion content are the primary indicators of the degree of soil salinization, their accurate estimation is essential to the determination of appropriate soil salinization remediation techniques, irrigation regimes, and the agricultural distribution layout. A total of 261 soil samples were collected from agricultural fields in the province of Xinjiang, China. A portable Fourier transform (FT) mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometer (4000-600 cm(-1)) and a visible near-infrared (VNIR) field spectrometer (350-2500 nm) were used to obtain soil spectra. We subsequently used partial least-square regression (PLSR) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to establish models in VNIR, MIR, and VNIR-MIR regions. The main objectives of this study are (i) to investigate the possibility of using spectroscopic techniques to predict total dissolved salts and soluble ion content; (ii) to compare the prediction accuracy of these soil properties in the VNIR, MIR, and VNIR MIR spectral regions; (3) to compare the prediction accuracy with linear and nonlinear algorithms. Our findings demonstrated that spectroscopic techniques are a promising way to predict total dissolved salts and soluble ion content. Good predictions were obtained for total dissolved salts content, HCO3-, SO42- and Ca2+, satisfactory for Mg2+, Cl-, and Na+, but poor for K. This work demonstrates the potential of portable VNIR and MIR spectrometers as proximal soil sensors for more efficient soil analysis and acquisition of soil salinity information. (C) 2016 IAgrE.

However, the poor dispersibility and stability of MoS2 in aqueous solutions limit its applications in cancer therapy. To overcome the shortcomings, MoS2 was modified mainly by surface adsorption of linear polymers, such as chitosan and poly(ethylene glycol). As reported, the linear polymers could be more rapidly cleared from blood circulation than their branched counterparts. Herein, we developed hyperbranched polyglycidyl (HPG)-modified MoS2 (MoS2-HPG) by absorbing HPG on the MoS2 surface. The MoS2-HPG as a novel photoabsorbing agent was also used as a nanoscaled carrier to load antitumor drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) (MoS2-HPG-DOX) for combined chemo-photothermal therapy. The physicochemical and photothermal properties of MoS2-HPG were measured, and the results indicate that MoS2-HPG had good dispersion and stability in aqueous solutions and also high photothermal conversion efficiency. MoS2-HPG displayed good biocompatibility in hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity evaluations in vitro. Furthermore, the combined chemo-photothermal therapy using MoS2-HPG-DOX demonstrated better anticancer effect than the individual chemotherapy or photothermal therapy alone. From the results, MoS2-HPG with combined chemo-photothermal therapy could be developed as a promising therapeutic formulation for clinical cancer treatment.

In this study, we developed endothelial monolayer model by using cell culture inserts, and systemically investigated the toxicity of TiNFs and TiNTs by RNA-seq, with a focus on Kruppel-like factor (KLF)-mediated effects, since KLF are transcription factors (TF) involved in the regulation of vascular biology. It was shown that NMs did not significantly induce cytotoxicity despite substantial internalization. However, the expression of many KLF was altered, and Western blot further confirmed that NMs down-regulated KLF2 proteins. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed that NMs altered the expression of KLF2-targed genes, typically the genes involved in inflammatory responses. KLF2-related Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were also altered, and it should be noticed that NMs altered GO terms and KEGG pathways related with endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). This study further verified that NMs decreased intracellular NO and eNOS proteins. All the observed effects were more obvious for TiNFs compared with TiNTs. Combined, this study showed that TiNFs or TiNTs were non-cytotoxic to endothelial monolayer model, but TiNFs and more modestly TiNTs decreased KLF2 leading to decreased eNOS proteins and NO production. Our data may provide novel understanding about the toxicity of TiNFs as well as other Ti-based NMs to endothelium.

However, simulation study gives rise to the opposite tendency. To understand such a phenomenon, both experiment and simulation were performed in this work. Two amino acid ionic liquids (AAILs) (i.e., [Emim] [Gly] and [Emim][Phe]) and two Zr-based MOFs (i.e., UiO-66 and NU-1000) were used to prepare a variety of IL/MOF composites. The reduced CO2 uptake observed in all IL/MOF composites upon ILs loading regardless of the amount of ILs is consistent with previous experimental reports. According to pore size distribution, similar pore sizes of the composites to those of pristine MOFs revealed that the blocking of channels by loaded AAILs into MOFs occurred, leading to decreased uptakes. Moreover, molecular simulation demonstrated that the blockage in channels significantly decreased CO2 uptake compared with the model consisting of randomly distributed ILs, which approximates experimental observations. This study provides experimental and theoretical evidence for the existing blockage in MOF channels upon ILs introduction, which contributed to the reduced CO2 uptakes of IL/MOF composites.

In this study, novel Fe-palladium (Pd)-bredigite biocomposites were developed by selective laser melting aiming to improve both the degradation behavior and bioactivity of Fe. The results showed that most Pd formed Pd-rich intermetallic phases (IMPs) with a nearly continuous network while the bredigite phase was distributed at the grain boundaries. In addition, a large amount of much nobler IMPs formed micro-galvanic pairs with the Fe matrix, inducing tremendous micro-galvanic corrosion. The IMPs contained a high amount of Pd2+ with a high reduction potential, which further promoted the efficiency of micro-galvanic corrosion. Moreover, the rapid degradation of bredigite also facilitated the penetration of the corrosion medium. As a result, the Fe-4Pd-5bredigite biocomposite showed a uniform degradation with a rate that is 6 times that of Fe. Furthermore, the developed Fe-Pd-bredigite biocomposites also featured excellent bioactivity, cytocompatibility, and suitable mechanical properties as characterized by the rapid apatite deposition, normal proliferation of human osteoblast-like cells (MG-63), and comparable strength and microhardness with the native bone.

In this paper, the effect of fine particles on the urban heat island intensity in Nanjing was investigated via the analysis of observational data and numerical modelling. The observations showed that higher PM2.5 concentrations over the urban area corresponded to lower urban heat island (UHI) intensities, especially during the day. Under heavily polluted conditions, the UHI intensity was reduced by up to 1 K. The numerical simulation results confirmed the weakening of the UHI intensity due to PM2.5 via the higher PM2.5 concentrations present in the urban region than those in the suburban areas. The effects of the fine particles on the UHI reduction were limited to the lowest 500-1000 m. The daily range of the surface air temperature was also reduced by up to 1.1 K due to the particles' radiative effects. In summary, PM2.5 noticeably impacts UHI intensity, which should be considered in future studies on air pollution and urban climates.

Multi-sensor fusion for the determination of several soil properties in the Yangtze River Delta, China	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Pedometrics Conference	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2017	Wageningen, NETHERLANDS				INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; IN-SITU; DIFFUSE-REFLECTANCE; NIR SPECTROSCOPY; ORGANIC-MATTER; SPECTROMETER; CARBON; PREDICTION; CHEMISTRY	Soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK) and pH are key chemical properties for evaluating soil fertility and quality. This study involved the integration of four soil sensors, visible near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectrometer, mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrometer, portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) analyser and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), to achieve rapid measurement of these soil properties. A genetic algorithm and partial least-squares regression (GA-PLSR) were used to select characteristic bands to reduce data redundancy. We then calibrated models from three aspects: models using partial least-squares regression (PLSR) based on single sensor data, models using PLSR based on fused sensor data, involving data combined from the four sensors into a new dataset to create a data fusion (DF) model, and models with Bayesian model averaging (BMA) based on prediction results of fused sensor data, involving prediction results combined from the four sensors into a new dataset to form the BMA model. The results showed the following. (i) For the single sensor, the predictive performance decreased as follows: mid-IR> vis-NIR > LIBS > PXRF. (ii) Compared with the single sensor approach, the DF approach slightly improved or even reduced prediction accuracy and caused a large amount of redundancy. We suggest that this approach is not able to improve predictive ability. (iii) The BMA approach achieved the best prediction for the six soil properties. Our findings suggest that model averaging of vis-NIR, mid-IR and LIBS could be a reliable and stable approach for the fast measurement of soil properties.

The initial Kr8+ ions beam energy was 2.1 GeV, after passing through the Al foil the beam energy came to 30 MeV. The implantation fluence was 2 x 10(12) ions/cm(2). A well region with the refractive index increment in near the surface was obtained after ion irradiation. This index increment was attributed to the ion-induced electronic damage. The characterization of the optical planar waveguide in Nd:YGG crystal was tested by prism coupling and end face coupling method. The micro-luminescence and Raman properties of our ion-irradiation Nd:YGG crystal were investigated. This work has reference value for integrated optical devices on Nd:YGG crystal.

Enhanced Photocatalytic H-2 Generation on Cadmium Sulfide Nanorods with Cobalt Hydroxide as Cocatalyst and Insights into Their Photogenerated Charge Transfer Properties	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						Co(OH)(2); photocatalytic H-2 evolution; surface photovoltage; photogenerated charge transfer; CdS; surface photocurrent	VISIBLE-LIGHT; HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; GRAPHENE OXIDE; WATER; CDS; PHOTOVOLTAGE; NANOCOMPOSITE; NANOSHEETS; CHEMISTRY; DIFFUSION	Cobalt hydroxide/cadmium sulfide composite was prepared using an easy coprecipitation strategy. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that Co(OH)(2) nanometer particles were modified on CdS. Even without noble-metal cocatalyst, the photocatalytic H-2 evolution over CdS after Co(OH)(2) loaded was evidently increased. The most excellent Co(OH)(2) of 6.8 mol %, resulted in a H-2 generation rate of 61 pmol h g, which exceeded that of pure CdS by a factor of 41 times. Surface photovoltage (SPV) and surface photocurrent (SPC) investigations revealed that the photogenerated electrons could be captured by the loaded Co(OH)(2) nanoparticles. The interface formed between Co(OH)(2) and CdS is vital to the enhancement of photocatalytic H-2 generation. Electrochemical measurement results indicated that another reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of Co(OH)(2)/CdS catalyst is that Co(OH)(2) has outstanding H-2 generation activity.

Impact of meteorological anomalies in the 2003 summer on Gross Primary Productivity in East Asia	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FAR-EAST; ARCTIC OSCILLATION; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; COMBINING MODIS; AMERIFLUX DATA; MONSOON ASIA; LARCH FOREST; TEMPERATE; EXCHANGE	Northern Eurasia experienced anomalous weather conditions in the 2003 summer. We examined how forest ecosystems responded to the meteorological anomalies during the period using the dataset collected at flux monitoring sites in Asia, including a boreal forest in Mongolia, temperate forests in China and Japan, and a sub-tropical forest in China, as well as the dataset from satellite remote sensing. From July to August 2003, an active rain band stayed in the mid-latitude in East Asia for an unusually long period. Under the influence of the rain band, the Gross Primary Production (GPP), of temperate forests was 20-30% lower in the 2003 summer than in other years due to significant reduction in the Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD). The GPP of a cool-temperate forest in the north of the rain band was slightly enhanced by the higher PPFD; however, the GPP of a sub-tropical forest located in the south of the rain band was reduced by drought stress due to extremely hot and dry conditions. The correlation coefficients for the year-to-year changes in the PPFD and GPP during mid-summer were calculated, and the spatial distribution was examined. The spatial pattern of the PPFD was calculated by satellite data, and that of the GPP was estimated by a regression-type model, which was trained and tested by ground observation data. The correlation was positive in the mid- and high-latitudes since light was an essential factor of the summer GPP. On the other hand, a negative correlation appeared in the lower latitudes, suggesting that the water limitation was much more important than the PPFD in the region. Our study illustrated that the integration of flux data from wide areas by combining satellite remote sensing data can help us gain an understanding of the ecosystem responses to large-scale meteorological phenomena.

Fabrication of steel matrix composite locally reinforced with in situ TiC particulate via SHS reaction of (Ti, Fe)-C system during casting	ISIJ INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						metal-matrix composites (MMCs); particulate; locally reinforced composites; TiC	HIGH-TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS; SLIDING WEAR BEHAVIOR; CARBON	The low-alloy steel matrix composites locally reinforced with in situ TiC particulates have been successfully produced utilizing the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reaction of (Ti, Fe)-C systems during casting. Two types of TiC particulates synthesized by different mechanisms exhibit a relatively uniform distribution in the local reinforcing region. The large rectangular TiC particulates with an average size of similar to 2 mu m or more, which are formed by the nucleation-growth mechanism through the contact reaction process, are mainly present in the local reinforcing region of the composites fabricated by (28Ti, Fe)-C system and the matrix region nearby the interface between the steel matrix and reinforcing region. The fine spherical/near-spherical TiC particulates, which are synthesized by reaction, solution and precipitation mechanism during the SHS reaction, are mainly existent in the reinforcing region. Moreover, the average size of spherical/near-spherical TiC particulates increases from similar to 0.1 to similar to 0.5, and then to similar to 1 mu m with the increase in Ti content from 28 to 48, and then to 68wt% in (Ti, Fe) powders. The interfaces of the composites are clean, which results in a good metallurgical bonding between steel matrix and reinforcing region in the composites. Moreover, the micro-hardness and wear resistance of the local reinforcing region of the composites are significantly higher than those of the unreinforced steel matrix.	[Li, S.

In this study, the zirconia particles were densified by an oscillatory pressure ranging from 27.5 to 32.5 MPa at 1450 degrees C, and then were carburized in the vacuum at 1300 degrees C. The result showed that the oscillatory pressure achieved several densification mechanisms, such as rearrangement of particles, plastic deformation of grains and sliding of grain boundaries. Consequently, the OPS specimen exhibited an increase in flexural strength from 998 MPa to 1556 MPa, and grain size reduction from 460 nm to 283 nm. The subsequent carburization of OPS zirconia induced high concentration of oxygen ion vacancies, and then high content and stability of the tetragonal phase. Thus, the carburized zirconia exhibited excellent comprehensive behaviors, demonstrating a flexural strength of 1646 MPa, fracture toughness of 8.8 MPa m(1/2 )and Weibull modulus of 25.8. The combination of OPS and consequent carburization in the vacuum is considered as an effective technique for preparing high-quality zirconia ceramics.

The multiarm copolymer had reactive hydroxyl pendant groups in the inner block of the arms, which were used to incorporate antitumor agent paclitaxel (PTX). The outer block of the arms was zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine) and had high hydrophilicity and zero net electric charge in a neutral environment. This feature endowed the PTX-loaded multiarm copolymer with high water solubility and prolonged blood circulation. The blood circulation half-life of the PTX-loaded multiarm copolymer was determined to be about 7.7 h versus 18.8 +/- 1.5 min of the reported blood circulation half-life of the PTX injected as commercial Taxol. The PTX-loaded multiarm copolymer was proved to be efficient in tumor accumulation and suppression.

Double-network (DN) hydrogels and homogeneous hydrogels are two typical samples. In this study, a novel ultra-strong and resilient double macromolecular network (DMMN) hydrogel system has been developed via a two-step sequential cross-linking process using hyaluronan (HA) and high molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) for the first and second network, respectively. A lower concentration of the HA precursor solution and a higher concentration of the PEG precursor solution as well as a higher molecular weight of the PEG precursor are beneficial to produce high-strength DMMN gels. Dynamic light scattering measurements demonstrate that DMMN gels possess the more evenly distributed polymer networks; the distinctive double and relatively evenly distributed networks of the DMMN gel make it combine the current DN and homogeneous network strategies for preparing robust hydrogels. The optimized DMMN gel is capable of sustaining up to 50 MPa of compressive stress. Besides, DMMN gels exhibit excellent cytocompatibility. This study expands the DN principle in designing and fabricating high-strength hydrogels with biocompatible macromolecules that show a promising prospect for biomedical applications.

Construction of highly dispersed and electroconductive silver nanoparticles modified mesoporous Co3O4 hollow nanoboxes from Prussian blue analogues for boosting lithium storage performances	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Ag-decorated Co3O4; Hollow nanoboxes; In-situ chemical reduction; Lithium-ion batteries	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; ANODE MATERIALS; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; ENERGY-STORAGE; ION; GRAPHENE; NITROGEN; BATTERY; ARRAYS; OXIDE	A facile strategy for the synthesis of well-conductive Ag nanoparticles decorated mesoporous Co3O4 nanoboxes is reported. The fabrication processes involve a thermal annealing of Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) Prussian blue analogue (PBA) template and subsequent in-situ chemical reductive deposition of Ag coating. The obtained electrically conductive Ag-coated Co3O4 hollow nanoboxes (Ag@Co3O4 HNBs) electrodes possess remarkable lithium storage performances as anodes including high reversible capacity, improved rate capability and long-life cyclability than bare Co3O4 HNBs. The optimized Ag@Co3O4 HNB anodes demonstrate high lithium storage capacity of 1015 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), distinguished reactivated capacity (1115 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and decent rate capability (339 mA h g(-1) at 5A g(-1)). The key points of improved electrochemical behaviors for Ag@Co3O4 composites are due to the formation of Co3O4 hierarchical nanostructure with high porosity as well as the enhancement of electrical conductivity introduced by Ag nanoparticles films.

Migrations of Pentagon-Heptagon Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayer: The First-Principles Study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; MINIMUM ENERGY PATHS; ELASTIC BAND METHOD; CARBON NANOTUBES; GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; ELECTRONIC STATES; SADDLE-POINTS; LINE DEFECTS; BN NANOTUBES	The first-principles calculations are employed to study the migrations of pentagon-heptagon (57) defects in hexagonal boron nitride monolayer (h-BN). A type of grain boundaries, consisted of 5-7 defects, is constructed on the basis of experimental observations. With the absorption of a pair of atoms, one 5-7 defect in the grain boundary migrates apart by one unit cell and afterward migrates again through the bond rotation. It is also found that the two migrations could be replaced by one single step when the pair of absorbed atoms is located at another specific site in the same heptagon. Energy barriers and reaction paths for the migrations of 5-7 defects in h-BN by the bond rotation are theoretically investigated by the standard nudged elastic band method and the generalized solid-state nudged elastic band method. To elucidate the difference between the bond rotation process of the 5-7 defects with N-N bonds and those with B-B bonds, a couple of typical 21.7 degrees grain boundaries with either N-N or B-B bonds are investigated. It is shown that the energy barrier of the migration of defects with N-N bonds is lower than that with B-B bonds in this type of grain boundaries.	[Wang, J.; Li, S. N.; Liu, J.

The dissociation process and the products are characterized by complementary analytical methods to establish the relationship between operational conditions and product properties. The innovation is to show proof-of-principle of a new synthesis route which offers access to less costly and less poisonous reactant, a higher quality product, and a simple, continuous and pre/post treatment-free manner with chance for fine-tuning "in-flight." Results show that Ni nanoparticles with controllable magnetic properties are obtained, in which flexible adjustment of product properties can be achieved by tuning operational parameters. At the optimized condition only fcc Ni nanoparticles are formed, with saturation magnetization value of 44.4 mAm(2)/g. The upper limit of production rate for Ni nanoparticles is calculated as 4.65 x 10(-3) g/h using a single plasma jet, but the process can be scaled-up through a microplasma array design. In addition, possible mechanisms for plasma-assisted nickelocene dissociation process are discussed.

In comparison to conventional polytetraflfluoroethylene (PTFE) friction material, the novel PI friction material enhanced efficiency from 29% to 44%, an improvement of 51.7%. The results indicated high friction coefficient and high elastic modulus were essential for improving efficiency. Inspired by the unique topography, the micro-dimples were introduced into PI friction material which improved the efficiency from 44% to 53%, an increment of 20.5%. The optimum parameter was diameter of 200 mu m and area density of 7%. The effect of surface texture on tribological behavior and output characteristic of the USM was comprehensively explored.

In this study, the process of gas flooding with actual components of Jilin oilfield is investigated by using molecular dynamics simulation method. We have chosen several alkane molecules based specifically on the actual components of crucial oil as the model oil phase for our study. The pressure of the gas phase is adjusted by changing the number of gas molecules while keeping the oil phase constant in the simulation. After the simulation, we analyze the variations of density in the gas-oil phase and interfacial characteristics to obtain the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) for different displacement gases. The results show that the density of the gas phase increases while the density of the oil phase decreases with an increase in the displacement gas pressure, resulting in efficient mixing between the gas phase and the oil phase. At higher gas pressures, the thickness of the interface between the gas and oil phases is higher while the interfacial tension is lower. At the same time, we observed that the higher the CO2 content in the displacement phase, the thicker the oil-gas interface becomes and the better the oil-gas mixing is under the same gas pressure. In this work, the gas-oil miscibility is studied with pure CO2, pure N-2, and the mixture of these two gases, and it is found that the minimum miscibility pressure for pure CO2 flooding (22.3 MPa) is much lower than that for pure N-2 flooding (119.0 MPa). When these two gases are mixed in 1 : 1 ratio, the MMP (50.7 MPa) is between the MMPs of the two pure gases. Moreover, the pressure required with CO2 is lower than that required with N-2 to achieve the same displacement effect. Finally, we explain the mechanisms of the different miscibility processes for different gas pressure and different displacement gases from the perspective of the total energy of the system and the potential of the mean force between the gas and the oil. The total energy of the system increases with the pressure of the gas phase, implying that the number of collisions between the oil and gas molecules increases and the gas-oil miscibility is enhanced. In addition, by analyzing the potential of mean force profiles, it can be concluded that the force of attraction between the oil-phase molecules and CO2 molecules is greater than that between the oil-phase molecules and N-2 molecules; thus, the CO2 molecules easily mix with oil, and the effect of displacement is more obvious. These results are of great significance for understanding the interfacial mass transfer characteristics of the gas-oil miscibility process and for guiding the optimization and design of enhanced oil recovery technology by gas flooding.

In the past decade, considerable studies have been done, with new patents being developed, on these 1-D building blocks for for their mechanical properties, especially elastic properties, which provide a solid foundation for the design of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and predictions of reliability and longevity for their devices. This paper reviews some of the recent investigations on techniques as well as patents available for the quantitative characterization of the elastic behaviors of various 1-D nanomaterials, with particular focus on on-chip testing system. The review begins with an overview of major testing methods for 1-D nanostructures' elastic properties, including nanoindentation testing, AFM (atomic force microscopy) testing, in situ SEM (scanning electron microscopy) testing, in situ TEM (transmission electron microscopy) testing and the testing system on the basis of MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) technology, followed by advantages and challenges of each testing approach. This review also focuses on the MEMS-based testing apparatus, which can be actuated and measured inside SEM and TEM with ease, allowing users to highly magnify the continuous images of the specimen while measuring load electronically and independently. The combination of on-chip technologies and the in situ electron microscopy is expected to be a potential testing technique for nanomechanics. Finally, details are presented on the key challenges and possible solutions in the implementation of the testing techniques referred above.

However, little is known about the flavor formation mechanism under osmotic conditions (low-temperature and high-salt) in A. oryzae. This work investigated the flavors and the relative protein expression patterns by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and proteomic analysis. Low-temperature and a high-salt content are unfavorable to the secretion of hydrolases and the formation of fragrant aldehydes. The aldehyde contents under osmotic conditions were reduced to 1.4-3.7 times lower than that of the control. Besides, copper amine oxidases which decreased under low-temperature stress and salt stress were shown to be important in catalyzing the oxidative deamination of several amine substrates to fragrant aldehydes. Furthermore, alcohol dehydrogenase and polyketide synthase are beneficial to the formation of alcohols and aromatic flavors under low-temperature stress and salt stress. Particularly, the ethanol content under 16 degrees C stress was 3.5 times higher than that under 28 degrees C.

Polydopamine (PDA) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been used to modify ITO electrodes for selective sensing of DA in the present of ascorbic acid (AA). The impedance of PDA membranes and the catalysis of AuNPs on the interfacial properties of the modified electrodes were studied tentatively. Experiments show that a three-layer AuNP-PDA hybrid membrane-modified ITO electrode has an excellent property in DA detection without being interfered by the existence of AA. The sensitivity of DA detection was obtained to be 0.300 mu A/mu M with a detection limit of 0.06 mu M (S/N = 3) in chronoamperometry measurement. The application of the electrode was verified in real sample analysis with both differential pulse voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements.

Future CO2 electrolysis devices promise to offer a convenient route to store large quantities of excess electricity in the form of synthetic fuels, such as methane, ethylene, or oxygenates. In this work, we explored the strategies to support long-term stability in electrocatalytic CO2 conversion to CO, hydrocarbons, and alcohols. We show how electrochemical preoxidation of copper electrodes used as catalyst may ensure longer-lasting activity and selectivity in CO2 reduction. We demonstrate that EDTA as an electrolyte additive can be a realiable impurity scavenger, especially combined with a catalyst pretreatment at anodic potentials. An unprecedented rate retention after 20 h electrolysis on a model polycrystalline copper was 91% for ethylene in the case when both anodic surface preoxidation and sufficient additive are applied. Additionally, we established that EDTA exhibits an additional role to being exclusively a chelating agent. We propose that local pH stabilization and increased CO2 concentration near the electrode surface also contribute to long-term stability and improved CO2 reduction selectivities.

Large Low Bias Negative Differential Resistance in an Endohedral Li@C-60 Dimer Junction	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; CARBON NANOTUBE; ATOMS; CONDUCTANCE; CLUSTER; C-60; C60	By applying the nonequilibrium Green function formalism combined with density functional theory, we have investigated the electronic transport properties of the C-60 dimer and its endohedral complex Li@C-60 dimer. Our results show that the doping of Li atoms significantly changes the transport properties of the C-60 dimer. Negative differential resistance is found in such systems. Especially, the doping of Li atoms can lead to a much larger negative differential resistance at much lower bias, and it is quite evident from the plot of differential conductance versus bias. The negative differential resistance behavior is understood in terms of the evolution of the transmission spectrum and projected density of states spectrum with applied bias combined with molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian states analyses.

The objective of this study was to investigate the contents, types, and physical properties of bound water and provide insights for understanding the thermal behavior and hydration process of the marine mucky silty clay under the control of bound water. Materials and methods: An integrated approach incorporating isothermal adsorption, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and specific gravity testing were developed to determine the contents and the boundaries of different types of bound water in Qingdao clay and investigate their physical characteristics. Results and discussion: Adsorption isotherm can be divided into two phases, which are the formation of strongly bound water and some capillary water under condition of p/p(s)< 0.9 and the formation of weakly bound water in the coverage for p/p(s)>0.9. The initial dehydration temperatures of strongly bound water range between 87 and 92 degrees C in the hydrated clays under condition of p/p(s) < 0.98. Weakly bound water starts to be released at temperatures near 60 degrees C and is completely removed at temperatures between 90 and 108 degrees C. Capillary water and free water are evaporated before 60 degrees C. The specific gravity of hydrated clay decreases linearly with adsorbed water contents. The volume of hydrated clay, volume of adsorbed water, and thickness of water film approximately linearly increase with adsorbed water contents. Conclusions: Quantitative determination and classification for bound water can be implemented through thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves. The physical properties of hydrated clay and bound water film are directly affected by the adsorbed water contents. The results may contribute to environmental and engineering risk assessment.

Their catalytic activity in the Li/SOCl2 battery was evaluated by adding right amount catalysts into the electrolyte. The results indicated that the capacity of the catalyzed battery increased by 6.74-67.26% and 13.41-84.36%, and the energy increased by 9.29-65.72% and 14.77-88.15% respectively, compared with the battery without phthalocyanines.

One-stage enzymatic hydrolysis utilizing alpha-amylase and glucoamylase simultaneously was established to efficiently harvest a maximum concentration of reducing sugar content of 7.26 g/L from CSW in 50 min. Lutein yield of 10.96 mg/L was obtained under 24 h continuous illumination with 2200 Lux light intensity. Furthermore, a cyclic feeding cultivation strategy was developed to improve lutein accumulation and COD removal up to 25.9 mg/L and 50.7%, respectively, after three cultivation cycles. Lutein yield of 14.86 mg/L and COD removal efficiency of 73.2% was achieved with further implementation in actual wastewater. This work provided a new perspective in developing the potential of cultivating microalgae with corn starch wastewater to produce high value lutein.

This study successfully fabricated an anisotropic ultrastrong, light-transmitting, and biodegradable film from wheat straw using the top-down strategy. The resulting wheat straw film (WSF) exhibited superb tensile strength (up to 754.34 MPa), specific strength (up to 580.26 MPa cm(3) g(-1)), and toughness (up to 18.72 MJ m(-3)) due to the well-aligned cellulose nanofibers after the chemical treatment and densification. Moreover, the WSF exhibited remarkable transmittance (approximate to 74%), haze (approximate to 79%), and anisotropic optical properties. Considering its degradability and excellent performance, the full wheat straw-based film could be applied to sustainable biomass-based products (such as optoelectronic devices and flexible electronics).

In this paper, MoS2 and CF are used to reinforce NBR based IPNs composites. Results reveal that the damping factor of fillers/IPNs composites reaches to 0.75 and their effective damping temperature range accomplishes to 50.3 celcius. The minimum friction coefficient and wear rate are 0.033 and 3.09 x 10-5 mm3/ Nm respectively, which is decreased by 51 % and 68 % compared with original IPNs. This indicates that MoS2 and CF have a brilliant synergistic effect on improving damping and tribological properties of IPNs, which is attributed to the prominent dispersion of CF and its synergistic effect with MoS2. The knowledge obtained in this work will be promising for preparing water-lubricated bearings materials with excellent damping and tribological performances.

A field experiment was conducted, using irrigation of RW plus urea fertilization under equal nitrogen (N) rate, namely, black water (BW), domestic wastewater (DW), gray water (GW), SW, and SW without any N application as a control (CK), to elucidate N removal by the paddy wetland system during the rice growing season of 2007. Materials and methods SW, GW, DW, and BW were collected from the village of Liangzhu in subtropical China. Water samples were stored in darkness at 4 degrees C in an icebox prior to analysis. Total nitrogen (TN) was analyzed by the spectrophotometric method with a continuous-flow automated analyzer. For the soil analyses, pH was measured using a pH meter with soil/distilled water - 1: 5; cation exchange capacity was determined with an unbuffered salt extraction method. Redox potential (Eh) was obtained using a pH meter with a platinum electrode, whereas organic carbon (C) was determined using the Walkley and Black method. TN was calculated by acid-alkali neutralization, after the soil samples were digested with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), distilled and then absorbed by diluted boric acid (H3BO3), and available N was determined by alkaline-proliferation law, after the samples were hydrolyzed, reduced, and absorbed by H3BO3. Available P was determined with the colorimetric method at the wave length of 660 nm, after the samples were extracted with NaHCO3, and available K was extracted by unbuffered NH4Cl and then determined by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The rice plant samples were digested with H2SO4-H2O2, and N contents were analyzed by the atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results Yield for the CK was significantly less (P <= 0.05) than those of SW, GW, DW, and BW, with the yield of BW significantly greater (P <= 0.05) than all the other treatments. The TN concentration of the floodwater in the paddy wetland system decreased rapidly after transplanting, rose significantly (P <= 0.05) after two N topdressings, and then decreased gradually as the following sequences: SW>GW>DW>BW>CK, but tended to be stable until 15 October. Meanwhile, TN removal rates from the wastewater were significantly higher (P <= 0.05) than those from the urea fertilizer. Total N load (TNL) increased significantly after two topdressings and reached the maximum value just after the first topdressing on 22 July: SW, 21.0 kg ha(-1); GW, 19.1 kg ha(-1); BW, 15.3 kg ha(-1); DW, 14.3 kg ha(-1); and CK, 0.57 kg ha(-1). Subsequently, TNL declined gradually and reached stability on 15 October. Just after the rice seedlings were transplanted, the soil released a large amount of inorganic N (26.3%-40.4%); however, after the topdressing, the soil adsorbed a lot of N and TNL originating from the RW, which had decreased, ranging from 34.5% to 47.8%. Discussion A reasonable N rate would be necessary for normal rice production in the Tai Lake region, which is different from those studies of other systems. Irrigation with RW for the paddy field could not only reduce the amount of commercial N fertilizer usage and irrigation water but also increase rice grain yield. Meanwhile, N use efficiency was improved by the combination of both N fertilizer and RW. The more N fertilizer was used, the higher the TN concentration in the flooded water would be, and the more potential risk of N to the surface water body. However, the N in RW could be removed more easily than that of the fertilizer by the paddy wetland system, which may be related to the existing form and concentration of N in the RW and urea fertilizer. The TNL in the floodwater had a positive correlation with the urea application rate, implying that appreciable amounts of N input might be lost, either by a heavy rainfall event or floodwater drainage using improper water management methods closely subsequent to the urea application. This revealed that using GW, DW, or BW instead of SW as irrigation water could decrease the loss of N applied and reduce the environmental pollution risk for the surface water. Conclusions Supplemental N was necessary in this area for normal rice production, and the rice grain yield of CK (without any N fertilizer applied) was significantly lower than the other treatments; however, the yield of SW (with N fertilizer applied) was not significantly different from those of GW and DW. However, irrigation with RW in the paddy rice field could reduce costs of fertilizer and irrigation water. In addition, using BW would significantly increase rice yield revenues. The paddy wetland system also removed large quantities of N due to the irrigation with RW and applied N fertilizer, with the TN removal rates for RW significantly higher than that for the N fertilizer. Thus, application of RW instead of N fertilizer alone could greatly decrease the discharge of N into water bodies; thus, paddy wetland system can be considered as a new method for the RW treatment, especially in the Tai Lake region of China. Recommendations and perspectives Based on this study, it would be strongly recommended to use RW irrigation after had been disinfected for reducing part of commercial N fertilizer rate and saving some irrigation water in rice production with the paddy wetland system as a cost-effective way to remove the N from the RW and mitigate the non-point pollution.. Future work should pay attention to the largest removal capacity of the paddy wetland system per unit and effect on the rice grain quality irrigated with the RW.

Moreover, the doping gap can be effectively modulated in each case by applying an external perpendicular electric field.

Compared to the previous C-H aminations of amides via C-H activation, this reaction presents a catalyst and oxidant controlled C-C bond cleavage strategy that enables amidation through a radical process. CuBr/Ag2CO3/O-2 shows the best catalytic result at 150 degrees C. A series of aryl and alkyl amides were compatible with this transformation. Notably, this method provided access to cyclohexanone, one of the most important industrial materials. The pathway of this reaction was investigated.

BChE can catalyze the reaction of acetylthiocholine (ATCh) to produce thiocholine (TCH), which has a thio-ligand to combine with mercury ions (Hg2+) in T-Hg2+-T. The released single-stranded DNA can associate with N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) and K+ to form a G-quadruplex, producing a strong fluorescence signal. Therefore, the concentration of the released probe DNA was proportional to the amount of BChE, enabling the conversion of the target reaction events into a detectable signal from the G-quadruplex-NMM. Parathion, as an inhibitor of BChE activity, can be used to prevent the generation of thiocholine and therefore leads to less or no release of free probe DNA. As a result, most of the probe DNA maintains its T-Hg2+-T hairpin structure in the reaction solution, which leads to a significant fluorescence signal decrease. Therefore, by using the "signal-off" mode, the simple and homogeneous fluorescence detection of OPs is readily achieved. Under optimal conditions, the detection limits of BChE and OPs are 0.15 ng mL(-1) and 0.025 ng mL(-1) respectively. Besides, BChE in serum samples has been detected with satisfactory results. The proposed method retains several unique advantages, including being simple, cost-effective, highly sensitive and selective for label-free analysis.

ZnO has been widely studied as an n-type MOS in H-2 sensing due to the excellent stability, mobile conductive carriers, and wide bandgap. However, the poor selectivity and high working temperature limit its practical applications. Herein, we designed a heterostructure based on ZIF-8-derived ZnO by rGO functionalization to boost the selective H-2 sensing. This composite demonstrated dramatic H-2 selectivity against other flammable gases, particularly ethanol, which was improved by deoxygenation to reduce the surface oxygen functional groups. This sample showed excellent H-2 sensing with a high response of similar to 18 to 200 ppm H-2, and a response/recovery time of 50/7 s at 400 degrees C. Even at a certain low temperature of 200 degrees C, the composite showed evident response to H-2. The excellent gas sensing behavior could be attributed to the heterojunctions and enhanced electron mobility. Regulation of the surface oxygen-containing functional groups opens up a promising approach to adjust the gas sensing selectivity of MOS-based materials.

The device was used to monitor slight change from specific binding of 2,4,6-TNT to the peptide. With high refractive index sensing of similar to 10(4) nm/RIU, the nanocup device can detect the binding of TNT at concentration as low as 3.12 x 10(-7) mg mL(-1) by optical transmission spectrum modulated by LSPR. The nanosensor is also able to distinguish TNT from analogs of 2,4-dinitrotoluene and 3-nitrotoluene in the mixture with great selectivity. The peptide-based nanosensor provides novel approaches to design versatile biosensor assays by LSPR for chemical molecules.

The aerodynamic characteristics, flue gas temperature, and gas concentrations were measured for various vane angles of outer secondary air in the burner nozzle region. The results show that a stable, symmetric central reverse-flow zone forms close to the exit of the burner nozzle region under deep air staging. With decreasing vane angle, i) the maximum axial, radial, and tangential velocities and swirl intensity of the airstream increase; ii) the decaying rate of velocity increases between X/D = 0 and X/D = 0.8; iii) the maximum diameter, length, and the jet divergence angle of the central reverse-flow zone increase; and iv) the relative reverse-flow rate increases. While the primary air concentration decreases slightly, the maximum primary air concentration decreases rapidly with decreasing vane angle. In contrast, the maximum axial relative mixing rate increases in the initial stage along the airstream direction. A decrease in vane angle increases the flue gas temperature, the rate of increase indicating a closer ignition position of the anthracite and lean coal along the airstream direction of the burner. The O-2 consumption rate and NOx formation rate increase in the initial stage of combustion, whereas in the later stage the CO concentration increases notably and the O-2 concentration remains almost constant below 1%. The CO concentration can exceed 20,000 ppm, which restrains the NOx formation and reduces the NOx concentration notably, but beyond X' = 0.8 m, the NOx concentration remains almost constant. The flue gas temperature varies slightly for different vane angles in the side-wall region. The O-2 concentration exceeds 4% near the location of the water-cooled wall. The O-2 concentrations are below 2% and the CO concentrations are above 5000 ppm along the radial direction 1.8375 m <= R' <= 2.3375 m from the centerline of the burner in the side-wall region. With decreasing vane angle, the CO concentration increases while the NOx concentration decreases. (C) 2016 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The redox behaviors and the electrochemical kinetics parameters of HPU-Fcs were explored by cyclic voltammetry (CV) according to electrochemical principle. The topological structure polymer was applied for the design and engineering of non-enzymatic glucose sensor. The designed sensor showed good response to glucose concentration with good stability, favorable accuracy and high selectivity. The electrode was also used to detect glucose in blood samples, and the glucose contents detected by the electrode were in good agreement with those from the hospital where a common automatic biochemical analyzer (HF240-300) was used.

We found that the most significant difference was observed in the adsorption energy for H2O molecules, which showed large contribution from electrostatic interactions in H2O adsorption energy, and for CO2 and N-2 adsorption energies, van der Waals interaction energies played a major role.

Herein, an amperometric aqueous FA sensor was fabricated by applying Pt-Ag core-shell nanoparticles as electrocatalyst. The well-characterized core-shell nanostructure exhibits high electro-catalytical activity for the detection of FA molecules in solution due to the synergistic effect of bimetallic Pt-Ag nanostructure. The proposed sensor exhibits high FA sensing performance, with a linear detection range from 1 to 100 mu M and a limit of detection (LOD) down to 1.0 mu M on the optimized conditions. Interferents coexisting in food samples were efficiently minimized by good selectivity. The Pt-Ag nanostructure-based FA sensor keeps catalytical activity for at least 30 d and shows good batch reproducibility. The proposed sensor was applied for the detection of FA in the food samples and satisfactory results were obtained, showing potential for the fast, simple, disposable, and cost-effective FA detecting method for food safety.

J	Xi, JF; Liang, J; Sheng, XC; Shi, LX; Li, S				Xi, Jianfen; Liang, Jie; Sheng, Xunchao; Shi, Longxi; Li, Shuang			Characteristics of lump lignite pyrolysis and the influence of temperature on lignite swelling in underground coal gasification	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS			English	Article						Underground coal gasification; Fissure; Swell; Lump coal; Pyrolysis; Lignite	EXPERIMENTAL SIMULATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; GAS EVOLUTION; PERMEABILITY; METHANE; DEVOLATILIZATION; PARTICLES; BEHAVIOR; CONTEXT; CAVITY	Underground coal gasification (UCG) allows in situ conversion of unmineable coal deposits into a combustible gas. UCG involves a number of steps, including combustion, oxidation-reduction (REDOX) reactions, pyrolysis, and drying, within the gasification channel at high temperatures. Pyrolysis, in particular, plays a vital role in UCG. We herein investigated the pyrolysis behavior of lump lignite from Inner Mongolia, China, and investigated the influence of pyrolysis on the swelling behavior of the lump lignite. The samples (50 x 40 x 40 mm(3)) were studied at a heating rate of 3 degrees C/min. The resulting chars were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In addition, the composition of the pyrolysis gas released from lump lignite was compared with that released from particle lignite (particle diameter =1 mm). The results showed that obvious swelling between 100 and 600 degrees C, followed by subtle swelling events between 600 and 900 degrees C. The concentrations of H-2 and CO gases in lump lignite were higher than those in particle lignite when exposed to elevated temperatures, and the main functional groups disappeared at high temperatures due to thermal cracking. Consequently, pyrolysis occurring in the gasification channel converted the coal around the channel into a highly porous char whose permeability aided the transport of gasification agents and product gases in coal seam.

Firstly, a single-source precursor (SSP) was synthesized by the reaction of allylhydridopolycarbosilane (AHPCS) with Fe-acetylacetonate [Fe(acac)(3)] at 140 degrees C. The SSP was heat-treated at 170 degrees C to generate Fe3O4 nanocrystals in the cross-linked polymeric matrix. Subsequently, the SSP was pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C-700 degrees C in argon atmosphere to yield porous Fe3O4/SiOC(H) nanocomposites with the high BET surface area up to 390 m(2)/g, a high micropore surface area of 301 m(2)/g, and a high micropore volume of 0.142 cm(3)/g. The Fe-free SiOC(H) ceramic matrix derived from original AHPCS is nonporous. The in situ formation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded homogeneously within a nanoporous SiOC(H) matrix shows significantly enhanced catalytic degradation of xylene orange in aqueous solution with H2O2 as oxidant as compared with pure commercial Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

The nanocomposite was characterized by using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of the nanocomposite were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge/discharge tests. The reversible capacity of the PANI/m-WO3 in the first cycle was 1064 mAhg(-1) at 60 mAg(-1) and remained at 803 mAhg(-1) at 180 mAg(-1) after 100 cycles, while the initial charge capacity of m-WO3 was 556 mAhg(-1) and remained only at 303 mAhg(-1) after 50 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite can be ascribed to the electronical conductivity of PANI and the chemical interaction between PANI and m-WO3. More importantly, the unique PANI coating layer on the m-WO3 is believed to play an important role in the capacity contribution of the composite.

The evolution of the fibrous phased RP nanorods on the surface of anatase TiO2 spheres was rationally adjusted by controlling the composition of precursors. The optimal RP/TiO2 composite exhibited a significantly enhanced visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 generation rate of 681 mu mol h-1 g-1. The tightly interior surface bonding between RP and TiO2 greatly promoted the efficient charge transfer and redistribution by suppressing the charge recombination and self-trapping processes within TiO2, resulting in prolonged lifetimes of the active charges during the photocatalytic process as investigated in detailed using femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy.

Herein, Pd concave nanocubes with high-index facets (Pd-CNs) was synthesized by a simple water-based route without seeds using L-ascorbic acid (AA) as the reduction agent in the presence of CTAB. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were employed to demonstrate the formation of concave structures with high-index facets of the Pd-CNs with an average size of 17.5 nm. The as-prepared Pd-CNs presented significantly higher catalytic activity than commercial Pd/C (an average particle size of 4.7 nm) in the electro-oxidation of methanol, but exhibited weaker property in Suzuki coupling reaction, which provided an evidence for the effect of shape and size on different reactions.

However, there is limited information regarding the effect of substituting mineral-N with manure on eco-efficiency (economic and environmental trade-offs) from a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) perspective. This study investigated the eco-efficiency of maize-wheat rotation production under three fertilization strategies: mineral fertilizer NPK (CK), substituting 50% of mineral-N with solid manure (SM + NK), and substituting 50% of mineral-N with liquid manure (LM + NP) in the North China Plain. The economic profits were evaluated based on the prevailing market prices of inputs, outputs, and services. The potential environmental impacts were assessed by the LCA approach. The eco-efficiency was evaluated as the ratio of economic profit to individual environmental impact categories. The results from the economic analysis and the LCA showed that, compared with CK, the economic profit increased by 17.2% and 19.1%, while the environmental impacts at the endpoint level decreased by 24.6% and 37.9% under SM + NK and LM + NP, respectively. Additionally, the eco-efficiencies under SM + NK and LM + NP at the endpoint level were calculated to be 55.4% and 91.7%, respectively, higher than CK.

The effects of anthropogenic compaction on urban soil denitrification are largely unknown. We conducted a study on an urban park soil to investigate how compaction impacts denitrification. By using N-15 labeling method and acetylene inhibition technique, we performed three coherent incubation experiments to quantify denitrification in compacted soil under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Uncompacted soil was set as the control treatment. When monitoring soil incubation without extra substrate, higher nitrous oxide (N2O) flux and denitrification enzyme activity were observed in the compacted soil than in the uncompacted soil. In aerobic incubation with the addition of (KNO3)-N-15, N2O production in the compacted soil reached 10.11 ng N h(-1) g(-1) as compared to 0.02 ng N h(-1) g(-1) in the uncompacted soil. Denitrification contributed 96 % of the emitted N2O in the compacted soil and 36 % of the emitted N2O in the uncompacted soil; total denitrification rate was higher in the compacted soil (up to 79.35 ng N h(-1) g(-1)) than in the uncompacted soil (0.11 ng N h(-1) g(-1)). Under anaerobic incubation with the addition of (KNO3)-N-15, no statistical difference in total N losses and N-15-(N2O+N-2) flux between the uncompacted soil and the compacted soil was detected. Compaction promoted soil denitrification and may impact urban N biogeochemical cycling.

However, the pore size distribution obtained with N-2 adsorption is only reliable at pore sizes >2 nm omitting the important contribution of micropore (<2 nm). Here, 13 coal samples from three series were measured by both the N-2 at 77 K and CO2 at 273 K, respectively, to compared the adsorption pore structure characteristics of different coal ranks, seams, and macrolithotypes, which further revealed the influences of mesopore (2-50 nm) and micropore on CH4 adsorption capacity at different pore sizes. The larger micropore total pore volume (TPV) contributes to the larger micropore SSA. As micropores are common and contribute extensively to most of the SSA (>99%) in these coals, a much better relationship exists between the Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) SSA and CH4 adsorption capacity (Langmuir volume). With the increase of the coal rank, the CH4 adsorption capacity increases continuously and the DR SSA shows a tendency of first decreasing then increasing; at the same coal rank, from the bright to dull coal, the vitrinite content as well as the DR SSA and CH4 adsorption capacity decreases; for the three main coal seams in the Hancheng mine area, the No. 11 coal has the largest DR SSA and CH4 adsorption capacity followed by the No. 3 coal and No. 5 coal. With CO2 adsorption, it is more significant than N-2 adsorption to accurately characterize the microscopic structure of coal and understand the gas adsorption mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of additives on electrolyte are studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge technique, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Raman spectroscopy. The results indicate that the vanadium redox cell using the electrolyte with the additive of D-sorbitol exhibits the best electrochemical performance (the energy efficiency 81.8%). The EIS results indicate that the electrochemical activity of the electrolyte is improved by adding D-sorbitol, which can be interpreted as the increase of available (-OH) groups providing active sites for electron transfer. The Raman spectra show that VO2+ ions take part in forming a complex with the D-sorbitol, which not only improve solubility of V(V) electrolyte, but also provide more activity sites for the V(IV)/V(V) redox reaction.

The prepared fiber was explored for the headspace solid-phase microextraction of five nitrobenzene compounds from water samples before gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The effects of the extraction temperature, extraction time, sample solution volume, salt addition, and desorption conditions on the extraction efficiency were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the linearity was observed in the range of 0.015-12.0 mu g/L for the compounds in water samples, with the correlation coefficients (r) of 0.9945-0.9987. The limits of detection of the method were 5.0-10.0 ng/L, and the recoveries of the analytes from spiked water samples for the method were in the range of 74.0-102.0%.

The HAuCl4 and PdCl2 mixture as catalyst precursor was directly decomposed on MgO support by plasma to form AuPd nanoalloy. Results demonstrated that the final particles states of nanoalloys prepared by this technique including size, morphology, and chemical valence are highly dependent on temperature of plasma treatment. The catalytic performance of AuPd/MgO in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols can be tailored by optimizing the synthesis parameter. A relative low temperature in plasma process prevents particles migration and helps to maintain the small size that favors high activity. The AuPd nanoparticles with diameter about 3.5 nm by optimizing the plasma treatment condition exhibit superior conversion and TOF compared to catalyst prepared by the traditional high temperature H2 reduction method. It is believed that the low temperature plasma technology has a unique advantage for the preparation of high-quality alloy nanocatalyst and could be extended for fabricating the other alloy nanocatalysts.

Electromigrative separations were performed in uncoated fused silica capillaries using streptomycin-modified gold nanoparticles (ST-AuNPs) as an additive to the background electrolyte. The ST-AuNPs are shown to serve as an effective chiral selector. The modified AuNPs were characterized in terms of size and zeta potential, and by IR and UV-vis spectra. The effects of ST-AuNP concentration, pH value, temperature, and separation voltage on the separations were systematically studied.

A novel CO/CO2 purification process, called the elevated-temperature pressure swing adsorption (ET-PSA), is coupled into an integrated gasification fuel cell (IGFC) power plant system in this work. A quantitative evaluation standard for the purification energy consumption is developed by considering both the net power efficiency loss of the IGFC after introducing the purification unit, and the total CO/CO2 removal rate. The sensible heat loss of syngas and the thermal regeneration of the saturated adsorbents are avoided; consequently, the calculated energy consumption of the ET-PSA (1.11 MJ/kg) process using the ideal purification unit as the base case is 36.2% lower than of the conventional solvent absorption method. Alternatively, high-temperature steam is consumed in the ET-PSA process during the rinse and purge steps, which leads to a decrease in the output power of the steam turbine. The purification energy consumption of the ET-PSA process can be further reduced either by increasing the hydrogen recovery ratio or by reducing the total steam consumption.

Based on the two-dimensional differential constitutive relations of nonlocal elasticity in the plane-stress state, this work derived the governing equation of nanobeams by introducing certain simplifying assumptions. The equation was then applied to the nano-cantilever beam subjected to several typical external forces, and the nonlocal effect on the bending behavior was thus revealed. Moreover, a different solution methodology was proposed in Appendix A to further verify the two-dimensional analyses in the text. It is shown that while nonlocal effect does not show up in the nano-cantilever beam subjected to a concentrated force only, the bending of the beam subjected to general transverse distributed loads is significantly influenced by the nonlocal scale effect factor. It is also demonstrated that the equivalent stiffness of a nanostructure predicted by the nonlocal theory may be larger or smaller than that by the classical theory, depending on the category of applied loads. Results reported in this study could be useful for designing or optimizing nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) where the nano-cantilever beam acts as a basic component. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the phenomenon of grassland reclamation has significantly increased since 2010. Here, the latest trend of conversion from grassland to cropland was evaluated using a Landsat dataset from 2010 and 2015 in the Mu Us Desert (MUD) of northern China. An object-based approach was chosen to classify grassland and farmland information, and the classification accuracy was 98.33% based on 120 cropland verification points, which were obtained through available Google Earth and field survey data. The area of grassland reclamation increased by 411.29km(2) from 2010 to 2015 and was mainly distributed in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the MUD, accounting for 9.78% of the total cropland area in 2015. There were two ways to reclaim grassland, including herdsmen cultivating grasslands on their own pastures and grassland reclamation projects implemented by enterprises under the direction of local governments. Exposed cultivated land is more susceptible to wind erosion and eventually leads to decreasing agricultural productivity and desertification. Therefore, strategies to reduce wind erosion on reclaimed grassland in the study area should be implemented as soon as possible, including several alternative cultivation systems and ridge tillage. If conditions permit, conservation tillage should be changed in the MUD.

Hollow hierarchical microstructure composed of nanoscaled subunits holds great potential in developing novel electrode materials with superior electrochemical performance. Herein, we demonstrate a bubble-templated method to synthesize Fe-2(MoO4)(3) hollow microspheres, and the formation mechanism is carefully investigated. When evaluated as the lithium-ion battery anode, they exhibit a high reversible capacity of 1205 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) after 200 cycles, good rate performance of 565 mA h g(-1) at 10 A g(-1), excellent low temperature capability of 281 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) at -20 degrees C, and high reversible areal discharge capacity of 5.2 mA h cm(-2) with a high active material mass loading of 5 mg cm(-2). Additionally, the full cell assembled with activated Fe-2(MoO4)(3) hollow microspheres negative electrode and LiFePO4 positive electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1115 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1). Furthermore, in situ X-ray diffraction analysis is applied to clarify the electrochemical reaction mechanism during the discharge/charge process. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Instead of using the counter-propagating coherent dual beams, we introduce a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) surface as a mirror boundary to the CPA configuration. Such a PMC surface can practically be embodied, utilizing high impedance surfaces, i.e., mushroom structures. By covering them with an ultrathin conductive film of sheet resistance 377 Omega, the perfect (100%) microwave absorption is achieved when the film is illuminated by a single beam from one side. Employing the PMC boundary reduces the coherence requirement in the original CPA setup, though the present implementation is limited to the single frequency or narrow band operation. Our work proposes an equivalent way to realize the CPA under the single beam illumination, and might have applications in engineering absorbent materials.

J	Li, S; Gaschnig, RM; Rudnick, RL				Li, Su; Gaschnig, Richard M.; Rudnick, Roberta L.			Insights into chemical weathering of the upper continental crust from the geochemistry of ancient glacial diamictites	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article							LITHIUM ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; CARBON-DIOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS; BUHWA GREENSTONE-BELT; U-PB GEOCHRONOLOGY; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; BLACK SHALES; SOUTH-AFRICA; LI ISOTOPES; ND ISOTOPES; CLIMATE	Glacial diamictites, with ages ranging from 2900 to 0.01 Ma, record the changing composition of the upper continental crust through time (Gaschnig et al., 2014). Li concentrations and isotopic compositions, combined with Pb isotopic compositions, chemical index of alteration (CIA) values and relative Sr concentrations are used here to assess the degree of chemical weathering recorded in these deposits and the origin of this signature. The delta Li-7 values of most of the diamictites (ranging from -3.9 to +3.5) are lower than those of mantle-derived basalts (+3.7 +/- 2, 2 sigma), and the low delta Li-7 values are generally accompanied by high CIA and low Sr/Sr* values (or Sr depletion factor, Sr/Sr* = Sr/(Ce*Nd)(0.5)), reflecting a weathering signature that may have derived from pre-depositional, syn-depositional, and/or post-depositional weathering processes. Profiles through three glacial diamictites with relatively high CIA (a fresh road cut of the Neoproterozoic Nantuo Formation (CIA = 62-69), and drill cores through the Paleoproterozoic Timeball Hill (CIA = 66-75) and Duitschland Formations (CIA = 84-91)) do not show evidence of significant post-depositional weathering. High Th/U, reflecting loss of uranium during oxidative weathering, is seen in all Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic diamictites and a few Paleoproterozoic deposits. Pb isotopic systematics suggest that this signature was largely inherited from preexisting crust, although a subset of samples (the Neoproterozoic Konnarock, Paleozoic Dwyka, and several of the Paleoproterozoic Duitschland samples) appears to have experienced post depositional U loss. Modern glaciomarine sediments record little weathering (CIA = 47, Sr/Sr* = 0.7, delta Li-7 = +1.8), consistent with the cold temperatures accompanying glacial periods, and suggesting that limited syn-depositional weathering has occurred. Thus, the chemical weathering signature observed in ancient glacial diamictites appears to be largely inherited from the upper continental crust (UCC) over which the glaciers traversed. The strength of this weathering signature, based on the CIA, is greatest in the Mesoarchean and some of the Paleoproterozoic diamictites and is weaker in the Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic glacial diamictites. Combining these data with data for Archean shales and other types of post-Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks (i.e., shales, mudstones, etc.), it appears that post-Paleoproterozoic upper continental crust experienced less intense chemical weathering, on average, than Archean and Paleoproterozoic upper continental crust.

However, various high-performance and low-cost solid electrolytes are incompatible with Li, which is indispensable for enhancing energy density. Here, we utilize a chemically inert and mechanically robust boron nitride (BN) film as the interfacial protection to preclude the reduction of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)(3) (LATP) solid electrolyte by Li, which is validated by in situ transmission electron microscopy. When combined with similar to 1-2 mu m PEO polymer electrolyte at the Li/BN interface, Li/Li symmetric cells show a cycle life of over 500 h at 0.3 mA.cm(-2). In contrast, the same configuration with bare LATP dies after 81 h. The LiFePO4/LATP/BN/PEO/Li solid-state batteries show high capacity retention of 96.6% after 500 cycles. This study offers a general strategy to protect solid electrolytes that are unstable against Li and opens possibilities for adopting them in solid-state Li-metal batteries.

The overgrowth of Au nanoparticles was driven by laser-induced photoexcitation of h-BN, which was monitored by absorption spectra. The h-BN/Au NCs with controllable Au compositions (0-1.85%) were characterized using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scan Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The microstructural analyses indicated that mono-dispersed Au nanoparticles with size of similar to 10 nm can be accreted on h-BN via 30 min synthetic reaction. The comparative SERS results reveal that the h-BN/Au NCs with 1.68% Au composition provide enhanced SERS activity in comparison with other nanosubstrates in this paper. The corresponding enhancement mechanism of h-BN/Au NCs has been illustrated in detail, which can be composed of four contributions in our research. Then, the SERS analyses demonstrated that the detection limit of CV molecules was achieved at femtomole level of similar to 10(-15 )M, leading to ultrasensitive monitoring of dye pollution. More importantly, well-defined linear relationships were established between SERS signal intensities and logarithmical scale of creatinine concentration (10(-2)-10(-6)M), providing a precise assessment of creatinine in pathological diagnostics.

In the present study, Ag-Mo hybrids as lubricant fillers were incorporated into thermosetting polyimide to prepare a new type of tribo-materials (TPI-1) at high temperature. Comprehensive investigations at different temperatures reveal that the newly developed TPI-1 exhibits a better reduction in friction and wear rate below 100 degrees C, but all of them increase significantly when the bulk temperature exceeds 250 degrees C. The wear mechanisms demonstrated that sandwich-like tribofilms with different layers were established at different temperatures, which was further verified by characterization of scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Considering the high-performance TPI coupled with Ag-Mo hybrids, we anticipate that further exploration would provide guidance for designing TPI tribo-materials that would be used at high temperatures.

Inspired by the hydrophobic surface structure of biomaterials, the hydrophobic charring agent N-methyl triazine-piperazine copolymer (MTPC) and modified magnesium oxide (MgO) were assembled on ammonium polyphosphate (APP) surface to prepare the hydrophobic intumescent flame retardant (HIFR) system. The constructed HIFR system presented excellent hydrophobic performance with the water contact angle of 139 degrees. The HIFR was incorporated into TPU matrix. The tensile strength and elongation at break of TPU/10 wt% HIFR composites increased by 48 and 106% compared with that of TPU/10 wt% APP. Meanwhile, the specimens of TPU/10 wt% HIFR composites before and after water resistance tests achieved UL-94 V-0 rating without drippings and the limiting oxygen index value was 27.5 and 27.3%. TPU/HIFR composites still maintained excellent flame retardancy and mechanical properties after water treatment. Cone calorimeter tests revealed that the peak of heat release and smoke production, and CO yield of TPU/10 wt% HIFR composites were significantly decreased with the reduction of 87.0, 63.2 and 28.6% compared with that of neat TPU. The incorporation of HIFR effectively enhanced the fire safety for TPU composites. The investigation of flame retardant mechanism for TPU/HIFR demonstrated that HIFR catalyzed the TPU matrix charring in advance and the generated compact, homogeneous and partial graphitized char layer exerted barrier effect in condensed phase, and the released inert gases evoked dilution effect in gas phase. This presented work provided a novel promising approach for preparing TPU materials with excellent comprehensive performance as well as water resistance and highly flame retardant efficiency.

The variations of temperature, pH, O2 consumption, organic mass and ammonia release were monitored. The results showed that addition of all these three types of agents could prolong the thermophilic stage during composting. The amendments of KH2PO4/MgSO4 and NaAc could increase and decrease the final pH levels, respectively. Application of K2HPO4/MgSO4 and NaAc would lead to a peak daily oxygen uptake rate of 10.0 and 12.4mg/(g center dot h) respectively, which were all higher than that with KH2PO4/MgSO4 amendment. Similarly, the reactors with K2HPO4/MgSO4 and NaAc were also associated with a higher cumulative oxygen uptake and total organic degradation rate. The amendment of NaAc resulted in a higher ammonia loss than the other two agents. More inorganic nitrogen contents were observed in the series with K2HPO4/MgSO4 and NaAc. It can be concluded that K2HPO4/MgSO4 additive showed the most favorable influence on composting performance. The results of this study will have important implications for developing appropriate treatment approach for food waste composting.

The interaction between the DND and SA matrix was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra verified DND can absorb solar energy in the UV, visible and even near-infrared regions. DND dispersed in the hydrogel matrix can absorb sunlight and generate heat, increasing the temperature of the matrix and resulting in slow release of water from the elastic beads. In addition, the effects of DND content and pH were systematically studied to evaluate their water adsorption properties. The swelling kinetics of DND@SA hydrogel beads in distilled water could be fitted well with a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Six consecutive cycles of water release-reswelling indicated that their easy regeneration and reusability. The novel and eco-friendly hydrogel beads should be applicable to on-demand, sequential, and long-term release of water via light exposure.

Results indicated that the as-prepared adsorbent exhibited fast adsorption rates in the first hour, at the optimum pH 6. The adsorption process was fitted well to the Langmuir isothermal and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the Langmuir model was 395.05 mg/g for NH2-M-SBA-15 sample. The kinetics of the uranium adsorption process over NH2-M-SBA-15 was described by pseudo-second-order kinetics. In comparison with the pristine large-pore SBA-15, the adsorption performance of NH2-M-SBA-15 was improved significantly. The thermodynamic parameters revealed that the adsorption of uranium on the material was spontaneous and endothermic. Furthermore, excellent recyclability could be achieved even after four consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles.

The composites were melt-blended with a novel vane mixer dominated by extensional deformation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy well demonstrated that ammonium molecules were successfully interacted with halloysite groups. Compared with unmodified HNTs, the modified HNTs had a better dispersion in the PP matrix. The degree of crystallinity increased with the introduction of HNTs into the PP matrix. Thermal analyses revealed that CTAB-HNTs can improve the composites' thermal stability compared with unmodified HNTs. As for dynamic shear rheology, the PP/CTAB-HNT composites showed higher viscoelaticity than neat PP in most frequency regimes, and that the raw HNT/PP composites presented the opposite phenomenon. The relaxation time of PP melt and the availability of heterogeneous PP domains increased with the presence of CTAB-HNTs.

The results revealed that the tropospheric ozone column concentration was high in East China, Central China, North China, and the Sichuan basin during summer. The increase in tropospheric ozone levels since the industrialization era produced clear-sky shortwave and clear-sky longwave radiative forcing of 0.18 and 0.71 W m(-2), respectively, which increased the average surface air temperature by 0.06 K and the average precipitation by 0.22 mm day(-1) over eastern China during summer. In addition, tropospheric ozone increased the land-sea thermal contrast, leading to an enhancement of East Asian summer monsoon circulation over southern China and a weakening over northern China. The notable increase in surface air temperature in northwestern China, East China, and North China could be attributed to the absorption of longwave radiation by ozone, negative cloud amount anomaly, and corresponding positive shortwave radiation anomaly. There was a substantial increase in precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It was related to the enhanced upward motion and the increased water vapor brought by strengthened southerly winds in the lower troposphere.

For these conditions, i.e., high mass velocities (above 1200 kg m(-2) s(-1)) and low heat flux (below 300 kW m(-2)), the convection heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) of supercritical pure fluids usually increase with temperature, peak near the pseudo-critical point, i.e., heat transfer enhancement, and then decrease for higher temperatures. Here, we experimentally demonstrated a new heat transfer enhancement phenomenon for supercritical H2O/CO2 mixtures. A high-temperature and high-pressure apparatus was setup to measure the convection HTCs of the supercritical H2O/CO2 mixtures. Experimental results show that surprisingly two distinct peaks of convection HTCs appear, with one corresponding temperature being the pseudo-critical point of the H2O/CO2 mixture, i.e., the thermophysical property variation induced mechanism, and the other one being the critical miscible point of the mixture, i.e., the dissolution-induced mechanism. These results pave the way to efficient heat transfer devices that use supercritical mixtures as heat transfer fluids.

However, the impact of tourism activities on glaciers at glacial tourism sites remains unexplored. Using two typical glacial tourism sites in China as examples, this paper uses the tourism heat footprint (THF) method to examine the impact of large-scale tourism activities on glaciers via local average temperatures. The THF method measures anthropogenic heat release (AHR) from energy consumption and human metabolism per unit area and time divided into seven components of tourism activities: transportation, accommodation, sightseeing, catering, entertainment, shopping and waste disposal. The main results show that the THF values of the Yulong and Hailuogou tourism zones are exhibiting a rapid growth trend, increasing from 8.7 x 10(-3) and 4.0 x 10(-4) Wm(-2) in 1990 to 3.6 and 3.0 x 10(-1) Wm(-2) in 2017, respectively. These THFs are exerting a significant cumulative effect on the retreat of glaciers by increasing local average temperatures in conjunction with global climate change. These results show that the sustainability of glacial tourism and destinations is threatened by large-scale tourism activities. This study fills a current research gap, enriches the understanding of the impact of tourism activities on glacial resources and expands the analytical perspective of sustainable tourism research. Moreover, this study provides decision support for managing glacial scenic destinations and for the sustainable development of glacial tourism. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we experimentally investigated the heat transfer to these important mixtures. First, a stable and accurate apparatus was designed and established to measure the forced convection heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) of supercritical H2O/CO2 mixtures. The measurement uncertainty of this apparatus is lower than those reported in literature attributed to the well controls of the pressure and the component mass fraction throughout the apparatus. Then HTCs were measured for the H2O/CO2 mixtures that flow in a vertically upward smooth tube with the fluid pressure of 24 MPa, temperatures from 400 to 460 degrees C, CO2 mass fractions up to 20.1% and mass velocities up to 1270 kg m(-2) s(-1). Results show that the supercritical mixtures have similar convection heat transfer behavior to supercritical pure fluids, and that the forced convection heat transfer coefficients of these mixtures can be well predicted using the correlation developed for supercritical pure fluids. These results lay the foundation for designing heat transfer devices with supercritical mixtures as heat transfer fluids.

Its multiple disciplinary nature appears as a hot research spot. Among those resources, offshore wind has been experiencing a rapid growth with strong industrial and governmental support. Among the research topics related to offshore wind turbine, those related to efficiency and safety issue receive most attentions, and they cover hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, structural dynamics, elasticity and so on. Hydrodynamics is considered as the key of these research for offshore wind turbine. This is not only because it is the fundamental of ocean engineering, but also it is similar to low speed aerodynamics which is the key of wind turbine rotor. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the important problems of offshore wind turbine hydrodynamics, we briefly review the evolution of offshore wind turbine and discuss the hydrodynamics problem associated with the research and development activities.

Here, a series of experiments were performed for 10 coal samples collected from eastern Junggar Basin, to compare the material composition, pore structure and adsorption capacity of lignite and candle coal. Contrast with the candle coal, the lignite has a higher inertinite content, larger pore volume, better connectivity, and greater specific surface area (SSA). During the process of FCJ, the polycondensation of coal molecules and the compaction of coal matrix occur, leading to a rapid decline of moisture, porosity and permeability, and the cell wall in the candle coal is badly crushed with clay minerals filled from optical microscopy. In general, the larger total pore volume (1.7-300 nm, measured by N-2 adsorption) contributes to the larger SSA. The SSA of candle coal mainly comes from the contribution of micropore (< 10 nm), especially the 2-3 nm pores, while the micropore and transition pore (10-100 nm) contribute to most of SSA of lignite. However, though the SSA of the candle coal is largely lower than that of the lignite, the CH4 adsorption capacity tends to decrease from the lignite to the candle coal due to material composition difference. Low-field NMR was used to determine the pore and fracture system by analyzing the transverse relaxation time, which showed that only two obvious peaks could be identified in lignite and three peaks at about 0.25 ms, 30 ms and 200 ms are present in the candle coal. The fractal results indicate that the pore surface and complexity inside the coal increase gradually from lignite to candle coal. These observations could deepen awareness and understanding of low-rank coal reservoir heterogeneity and the influence of FCJ on reservoir property.

J	Hu, L; Wang, YF; Li, S; Zhang, CH; Deng, DA				Hu Long; Wang Yifeng; Li Suo; Zhang Chaohua; Deng Dean			Study on Computational Prediction About Microstructure and Hardness of Q345 SteelWelded Joint Based on SH-CCT Diagram	ACTA METALLURGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Q345 steel; simulation of microstructure and hardness; SH-CCT diagram; numerical simulation	WELDING RESIDUAL-STRESS; PLAIN-CARBON-STEEL; PHASE-TRANSFORMATION; QUENCHING PROCESS; SIMULATION; EVOLUTION; TEMPERATURE; ACCURACY; MODEL	Q345 steel is a low-alloy high-strength steel that is widely used in production. As the solid-state phase transition of Q345 steel is very sensitive to temperature, the microstructure and hardness of joints fabricated with this steel are difficult to predict. Therefore, studying the welding metallurgy, residual welding stress, and welding deformation of Q345 steel joints is essential for improving the safety and service life of Q345 welding structures. In this study, the microstructure and distribution of hardness of a Q345-steel tungsten-inert-gas welded and re-melted joint were calculated using four models encoded in the general finite element software, ABAQUS, and FORTRAN language. Three models were based on only one of three welding continuous-cooling transformation curves of the simulated heat-affected zone (SH-CCT) of Q345 steel, with peak temperatures of 1300, 1100, and 900 degrees C (hereafter denoted as SHCCT (1300), SH-CCT1100, and SH-CCT900, respectively). The final model was based on the associated diagram consisting of these curves SH-CCT diagram above. Comparing the simulation and experimental results, the capabilities and accuracies of the prediction methods based on the different models were investigated. The microstructural calculations of the single SH-CCT diagram agreed with the experimental results only in the local heat-affected zone (HAZ) and largely deviated in the other areas. In the model based on SH-CCT900, the relative error of the ferrite volume fraction in the inter-critically HAZ (ICHAZ) was 7.7%. In the model based on SH-CCT1100, the relative errors of the ferrite, bainite, and martensite volume fractions in the fine-grained HAZ (FGHAZ) were 11.3%, 17.3%, and 15.5%, respectively. In the model based on SH-CCT1300, the relative error of the martensite volume fraction in the coarse-grained HAZ (CGHAZ) was 29.6%. In contrast, the microstructural calculations of the associated SH-CCT diagram agreed with the experimental results over the whole HAZ. The results showed that models based on the single SH-CCT diagrams met the tested hardness only in several narrow areas of the HAZ, but the hardness computed by the model, based on the associated diagram, was consistent with the tested hardness, with absolute differences ranging from 0 to 14 HV. The calculated microstructure and hardness in the fusion zone (FZ) greatly deviated from the test results in all the four models, indicating that predictions in the FZ require an accurate SH-CCT diagram of the FZ. In practical welding processes, the corresponding single SH-CCT diagram can adequately predict the microstructure and hardness during the phase transition of one HAZ area (such as the CGHAZ).

In this paper, hierarchical porous manganese dioxide (MnO2) self-assembled by particle-size controlled porous nanoflowers with specific surface areas of > 300 m(2) g(-1) are prepared at room temperature by a simple template-free approach. The formation of porous nanoflowers as well as their particle sizes are found to be determined by the nucleation concentration in initial reaction. And investigation on the electrochemical performance and microstructures demonstrates that the specific capacitance of mesoporous MnO2 with similar crystallizations and morphologies is mainly determined by their specific surface areas (SSAs). And sample with average particle size of 60 similar to 80 nm as well as SSA of 380 m(2) g(-1) and a pore volume of 1.97cc g(-1) exhibits the best electrochemical performance, a high specific capacitance of 245 F g(-1) with excellent cycling stability of 99.1% after 5000 cycles at 5 A g(-1) in 1 M aqueous Na2SO4, due to its well-defined morphology with proper particle size, larger specific surface areas (SSA) and higher pore volume.

The halloysite (Hal) exhibits liquid-like behavior in the absence of solvent above 80 degrees C while it is a gel-like stickum at room temperature. Moreover, the morphology, rheological behavior, thermal and dispersion properties of the resultant Hal nanofluids were systematically characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-Vis transmission spectra and rheological test. Rheological test results show that viscoelasticity (solid-like to liquid-like transition) of Hal nanofluids were regulated by temperature variation. The unique properties of the Hal nanofluids have made this material promising in the applications as rheological additives in industrial paints and polymer processing aids fields.

The composition, microstructure, thermal shock, and oxidation resistance of these coatings were characterized and assessed. High silicon/graphite ratio (in this case, 2) did not guarantee higher coating density, instead could be harmful to coating formation and led to the lump of pack powders, especially at temperatures of 2100 and 2200 degrees C. But residual silicon in the coating is beneficial for high density and oxidation protection ability. The SiC/ZrB2-SiC (ZS50-2) coating prepared at 2000 degrees C showed excellent oxidation protective ability, owing to the residual silicon in the coating and dense coating structure. The weight loss of ZS50-2 after 15 thermal shocks between 1500 degrees C and room temperature, and oxidation for 19 h at 1500 degrees C are 6.5% and 2.9%, respectively.

Here, multifunctional hybrid foam with pomegranate-like microstructure are fabricated, which based on paraffin wax (PW)-in-water Pickering emulsion stabilized by cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). The in-situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer induced the creation of CNF/Fe3O4/ PW/polypyrrole (PPy) hybrid foam, wherein PW microspheres were covered with CNF/Fe3O4/PPy nanocomposite shells. The obtained foam exhibited excellent microwave absorption performance with a reflection value (RL) of -55.6 dB and broadband bandwidth of 10.0 GHz (8.0-18.0 GHz). Owing to the specificity in the structure of hybrid foams with embedded PW microspheres, the maicrowave performance can be adjusted by regulating the amount of PW microspheres in composite foam. Moreover, pomegranate-like microwaveabsorbing foams also show excellent photo-thermal conversion and energy storage, meaning this multifunctional composite foam has potential applications in microwave absorption, thermal energy storage systems, and smart buildings.

A high-performance anode for LIBs based on alpha-Fe2O3 nanoplates have been selectively prepared. The alpha-Fe2O3 nanoplates can be synthesized with iron ion-based ionic liquid as iron source and template. The alpha-Fe2O3 nanoplates as the anode of LIBs can display high capacity of around 1950 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) which have exceeded the theoretical capacity of alpha-Fe2O3. On account of unique nanoplate structures and gum arabic as binder, the alpha-Fe2O3 nanoplates also exhibit high rate capability and excellent cycling performance.

In particular, the catalysts can transform 2(5H)-furanone (HFO) to g-butyrolactone (GBL) efficiently under mild conditions, which effectively upgrades the biomass-derivatives. The superior catalytic activity can be attributed to the synergism of the geometric construction and electronic regulation. Specifically, ultrathin NiO nanosheets contain plenty of surface defects and relatively large mesopores. Those defects can be helpful in the activation and dissociation of hydrogen, the adsorption of HFO molecules, as well as the enhancement of the local hydrogen concentration on the catalyst, while the pores can be considered as nano-reactors for hydrogenation. The strong interaction at the interface caused by the in situ synthesis can further tune its electronic structure and improve the hydrogen adsorption. In addition, the catalyst also displays great catalytic properties for p-nitrophenol (PNP) hydrogenation and non-enzymatic glucose sensing, which further supports the promising application potential of such catalysts with the unique mesostructures of Ni/NiO heterojunctions with defect-rich ultrathin nanosheets.

There is a conflict between sustaining post-silking photosynthesis and the remobilization and recycling of N, P and K from leaves to grain. To study the accumulation and partitioning patterns of DM, N, P and K after silking in maize with different leaf longevity, two field experiments with six maize varieties including early-senescing (old varieties) and stay-green leaves (new varieties) were conducted in successive years. The results demonstrated that new varieties had larger total leaf area and longer green leaf duration, and took up more N, P and K after silking than old varieties. Post-silking leaf appeared to provide sufficient assimilates for grain formation, while large amounts of N, P and K accumulated pre-silking were remobilized and exported from vegetative tissues, especially from leaves, in all varieties during grain filling. Post-silking leaf N export caused a large decrease in leaf N concentration in all maize varieties. Post-silking uptake of N and P account for 11-43% and 16-55% to total content of whole plants at maturity, but a post-silking loss of K from maize plants was observed, especially in old varieties. The export of N, P and K from leaves was similar in all varieties and an un-synchronized accumulation and partitioning of N, P and K during plant development was observed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have focused on the characteristics of macrolithotypes. Here, the macrolithotype samples from the three continuous seams (No. 3, 5 and 11) in the Hancheng Block, Ordos Basin, China were quantitatively characterized by multiple length scales. The results indicate that the bright coal has the best development of micro-fracture than those of the other macrolithotypes, which with good openness and connectivity under the optical microscopy; N-2 adsorption/desorption results reflect that the adsorption pores of the semi-dull and dull coal are more developed than the bright coal and semi-bright coal, and are dominated by plate-like and ink-bottle pores. The characteristics of the mercury intrusion/extrusion curves were determined by the mercury injection (MIP). From bright to dull coal the pore connectivity being worse, and the uniformity of pore and throats distribution becomes lower. The pore type that divided by NMR are recovered to be seepage type (the bright), comprehensive type (the semi-bright and semi-dull), and the type of adsorption (the dull). The behavioral differences would impact the porosity and permeability in coal. Thus, by the well logging evaluation approach, the relationship between coal macrolithotypes and select logging parameters were determined for coal macrolithotype identification, and with the petrel software included, the porosity-permeability models were built to investigate the permeability evolution with the coal macrolithotypes. Macrolithotypes are closely related to the permeability of coal reservoirs in this area. The greater contribution of permeability is typically from of the bright and semi-bright coal, and followed by semi-dull and dull coal, the better development of bright coal, the better permeability of the reservoir and vice versa.

The responses of marine ecosystems to these climate events are relatively well known worldwide; however, lacustrine responses are poorly known due to the less frequent and discontinuous terrestrial fossil records. The relative changes in charophyte diversity in continuous lacustrine sedimentary sequences from two basins in East Asia, i.e., Songliao and Jiaolai, are considered here for the first time to establish their correlation with global climate changes during the Late Cretaceous and K/Pg boundary, compared with the well-studied south European Ibero-Armorican Island. Lacustrine deposits correlated with the Campanian-Maastrichtian Boundary Event (CMBE), related to a long cooling period provided a relatively low diversity in East Asia. In contrast, we detected a diverse charophyte flora in lacustrine deposits correlated with the Mid-Maastrichtian Event (MME) in East Asia in a global warming trend. A higher charophyte diversity was further found in the end-Cretaceous global warming event due to speciation under the background of latest Maastrichtian warming event (LMWE). During the LMWE, Characeae species such as Microchara cristata reduced its size significantly due to environmental stress probably related to the Deccan volcanism. On the other hand, a general tendency of increasing the gyrogonite size in new Characeae taxa has been detected in populations extracted from lower Danian deposits, probably related to stable palaeoenvironmental conditions in a global cooling context. This study represents the first attempt to correlate the response of the charophyte flora to global climate changes in permanent lacustrine systems during the three main Late Cretaceous-early Danian climatic turnovers.

When applied as electrode materials, they all exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. The asprepared MnO2 samples were characterized by means of XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS. Additionally, the relationship of the crystalline nature with the electrochemical performance was investigated. Among the three samples, the product with the poorest crystallinity had the highest capacitance of 220 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g. It is thought that the ultrathin MnO2 nanostructures can serve as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.

Its electrochemical properties are studied by cyclic voltammetry. The results demonstrate that LaNi0.8Co0.2O3 exhibits excellent electrochemical activity with respect to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and good tolerance of BH4- ions. Maximum power densities of 114.5 mW cm(-2) at 30 C and 151.3 mW cm(-2) at 62 degrees C are obtained, and good stability (300-h stable performance at 20 mA cm(-2)) is also exhibited, which shows that such perovskite-type oxides as LaNi0.8Co0.2O3 can be excellent catalysts for DBFCs.

Prospectively, employing 2D semiconductors with reduced density of states leads to a long excited-state lifetime that allows us to directly image the dynamics of the adsorbate. We show that epitaxial blue phosphorene (blueP) on Au(111) provides such a platform to trap water molecules in the periodic nanopores without formation of strong bonds. The trapped water aggregate is tentatively assigned to a hexamer based on our scanning tunneling microscopy studies and first-principles calculations. Real-space observation of conformational switching of the hexamer induced by inelastic electrons is achieved by using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy with molecular resolution. We found a localized interfacial charge rearrangement between the water hexamer and P atoms underneath that is responsible for the reversible desorption and adsorption of water molecules by changing the sample bias polarity from positive to negative, offering a promising strategy for engineering the electronic properties of blueP.

However, inefficient removal of natural organic matter (NOM) and membrane fouling problems, especially those initiated by the adhesion of biopolymers, greatly restrict the practical application of the UF process. Here, we investigated a biologically enhanced coagulation-ultrafiltration (CUF) process treating samples of a natural surface water, which demonstrated a superior NOM removal and antifouling performance. The membrane flux (under 1.0 bar constant pressure) of the biologically enhanced CUF [using polyaluminum chloride (PACl)] process scheme was approximately 4.4 and 8.4 times higher than that of a conventional CUF and direct UF process, respectively, and PACl was found to perform better than AlCl3. Characterization of the NOM showed that the biological pretreatment combined with the coagulation process significantly contributed to the reduction of hydrophobicity, aromaticity, and molecular weight of the dissolved organics. Analyses of biopolymers showed that the combined process can remove over 99% of the biopolymers (represented by proteins and polysaccharides), which are considered to be the main cause of membrane fouling. Results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and FTIR analyses further elucidated the transformation and reduction of biopolymers during the combined process. With respect to the disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBP-FP), the results showed that the conventional CUF process had a limited impact on the DBP-FP, while the biologically enhanced CUF process had a substantial impact consistent with meeting the current EPA DBP standards. Overall, this study has highlighted the potential advantages of using a biologically enhanced CUF process for producing higher quality drinking water with a simultaneous low membrane fouling propensity.

In this paper, oat bran oil (OBO) was firstly extracted by subcritical butane extraction (SBE) and the extraction process was optimized using response surface methodology. Three variables involving liquid-to-solid ratio, extraction time and extraction temperature were studied. The optimum conditions for extraction of OBO were obtained as follows: liquid-to-solid ratio 4.30, extraction time 48.15 min, and extraction temperature 46.52 degrees C. Based on this, an alternative method (SBE-e) for cosolvent (ethanol) was proposed to improve SBE method. Compared to conventional hexane extraction (CHE), the SBE-e had significant effect on yield, bioactive compounds (phytosterols and phenols) and antioxidant capacity (AC) in the extracted OBO. The results indicated that the proposed methods were appropriate for OBO extraction. Additionally, OBO had the potential to be an acceptable substitute for edible oil, owing to its desirable physicochemical characteristics, a balanced fatty acids composition and high antioxidant capacity.

Water molecules may compete for adsorption sites, reducing the capacity of the material, and dehumidification prior to separating CO2 from N2 increases process complexity and cost. The development of adsorbent materials that can selectively adsorb CO2 in the presence of water would be a major step forward in the deployment of CO2 capture materials in practice. In this study, large-scale computational screening was carried out to search for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high selectivity toward CO2 over H2O. Calculating framework charges for thousands of MOFs is a significant challenge, so initial screening used a fast, but approximate, charge calculation method. On the basis of the initial screening, 15 MOFs were selected, and Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to compute the adsorption isotherms for these MOFs using more accurate framework charges calculated by density functional theory. A detailed investigation was performed on the effect of using different methods for calculating partial charges, and it was found that electrostatic interactions contribute the majority of the adsorption energy of H2O in the selected MOFs.

Recently, metal oxides derived from metal nitrides, sulfides, chalcogenides, and phosphides have been demonstrated to exhibit superior catalytic activity as electrocatalysts for the OER but otherwise are difficult to gain access to by conventional metal oxidation methods. In this work, we demonstrate a novelin situchemical etching process of Ni(OH)(2)nanosheets followed by a thermal ammonolysis process to fabricate iron-nickel nitride Ni3FeN supported by pure Ni metal. Ni3FeN is not stable and would be converted partially into NiFeOOH under oxygen-evolution conditions, forming a NiFeOOH/Ni3FeN/Ni heterojunction showing extraordinarily high activity for the OER in alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1). We demonstrated that NiFeOOH is the major active material while Ni3FeN/Ni could help increase the charge transfer dramatically.

By changing the ZIF-8 ratio in the aerogel, the pore size, pore surface roughness, and specific surface area of the aerogel can be controlled and adjusted successfully. Compared with pure PLA aerogels, the prepared ZIF-8@PLA aerogels have higher oil wettability and significantly improved mechanical properties. The morphology, wettability, adsorption capacity, circulating oil-water separation capacity, and oil adsorption capacity of the composite aerogels were thoroughly investigated. The results show that ZIF-8@PLA aerogel with 1 wt% ZIF-8 exhibits the highest oil wettability, the largest specific surface area, the highest oil-water separation performance, and good reusability in oil-water separation. The tensile strength and breaking elongation of ZIF-8@PLA aerogel with 1 wt% ZIF-8 are raised to 0.257 MPa and 23%, while those of pure PLA membranes are 0.135 MPa and 13%, respectively. The ZIF-8@PLA aerogel has been proved to be an ideal material for efficient oil-water separation due to the rapid oil wetting capacity, pore roughness, and synergistic adsorption of ZIF-8 porous nanoparticles.

Tillage effects on soil nitrification and the dynamic changes in nitrifying microorganisms in a subtropical rice-based ecosystem: A long-term field study	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Conservation tillage; Conventional tillage; Paddy soil; Ammonia oxidizer	CONVENTIONALLY TILLED CORN; AGGREGATE-SIZE FRACTIONS; NO-TILLAGE; NITROGEN-MINERALIZATION; AMMONIA OXIDATION; NORTHERN FRANCE; ORGANIC-CARBON; CROP-ROTATION; ARCHAEA; SYSTEMS	The dynamics of N mineralization and nitrification may be altered by tillage, which ultimately affects crop growth and yield. This study investigated effects of tillage on soil nitrogen dynamics in a subtropical rice (Oryza sativa L.) soil (Hydragric Anthrosols, WRB classification) under combination ridge with no-tillage (RNT) and conventional tillage (CT) for 22 years in Chongqing, China. Soil mineralization, nitrification and changes in abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) were investigated to test the hypothesis that RNT decreases nitrification in the rice-based ecosystem. Soil mineralization and nitrification rates decreased after 22 years of RNT compared with CT. Soil pH decreased about 0.5 units after 22 years of RNT, and this difference may be responsible for the decrease of N mineralization and nitrification rates observed under RNT. The nitrification process was best fitted by a first-order kinetic model for both CT and RNT. While the nitrification rate was significantly lower for RNT (2.96 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)) than CT (3.40 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)), AOB and AOA amoA gene copies were significantly higher for RNT than CT. This suggested that the functional expression (i.e., nitrification) may not be closely related to numbers of microorganisms that have the ability to nitrify. The AOA dominated in abundance over the AOB for both CT and RNT paddy soils, with AOA to AOB ratios ranging from 13 to 52, and the AOA abundance showed similar changes with AOB, suggesting that AOA may also play an important role in soil nitrification. Results implied that RNT may increase soil N retention by keeping N longer in the NH4+ state, thus decreasing the potential for N loss from leaching. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it remains unclear understanding the role of TGF-beta 1 in collagen excessive formation. Here, we found nano NiO could directly promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the TGF-beta 1/Smads pathway in A549 cells. First, cytotoxicity induced by nano NiO has a dose- and time-dependent manner according to methylthiaozol tetrazolium assay. Second, nano NiO led to the increased contents of type I collagen (Col-I), TGF-beta 1, p-Smad2, p-Smad3, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), vimentin, and fibronectin, indicating Smads pathway activation and EMT occurence. Third, to verify whether TGF-beta 1 activated Smads signaling pathway and EMT occurence, A549 cells were exposed to nano NiO and TGF-beta 1 inhibitors (10 mu M SB431542). The results showed that TGF-beta 1 inhibitors alleviated the nano NiO-induced cytotoxicity and Col-I excessive formation. Meanwhile, TGF-beta 1 inhibitors reversed the proteins expression trends of Col-I, p-Smad2, p-Smad3, alpha-SMA, vimentin, fibronectin, and E-cadherin. These observations suggested that EMT occurrence via TGF-beta 1/Smads pathway might play an important role in the collagen excessive formation induced by nano NiO in A549 cells.

The experimental results reveal the 2-(quinolin-2-yl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one has a good inhibiting effect on corrosion of Q235 steel in 1 mol/L HCl solution. Polarization studies show that the 2-(quinolin-2-yl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one is a mixed type inhibitor. The adsorption of the inhibitor on steel surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm and contains both physisorption and chemisorption. On the basis of surface analysis and characterization, the formation and characteristic of an adsorption-related protective inhibitor film on the steel surface have been verified. Finally, the mechanisms of corrosion and protection of the Q235 steel by the quinoline derivative inhibitor have been proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The structure of the resulting composites was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and FT-IR spectra. The PANI/ATP was coated on a piece of stiff paperboard to construct a paper electrode, and the electrosorption of Pb(II) was carried out by polarizing the PANI/ATP paper electrode at the potential of -0.3 V. The removal of Pb(II) was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of physisorption, chemsorption (chelation) and electrostatic interaction, and the effect of electrostatic interaction and chelation is more significant than that of physisorption. Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of applied potential, mass ratio of aniline to ATP, initial concentration, and contact time on the removal of Pb(II). The Freundlich isotherm model fitted the experimental data significantly, and the adsorption kinetics was well described by the pseudo-second-order model. Moreover, electrodesorption experiments were performed to reveal the feasibility for the regeneration of the PANI/ATP paper electrode. All the results indicated that the PANI/ATP could be a promising material for Pb(II) removal. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The heterogeneous co-crystallization of the analyte and the matrix creates a sweet spot effect and reduces point-to-point reproducibility. In this study, an amorphous poly-N-vinylcarbazole polymer (PVK) was studied as a novel matrix for MALDI-TOF MS to detect various low molecular weight compounds (LMWCs) in the negative ion mode. The PVK achieved excellent matrix action and showed high sensitivity, good salt tolerance, and reproducibility.

Here, these issues are solved with a sodium phosphate (Na3PO4)-modified tin(IV) dioxide (SnO2) layer that simultaneously boosts the device performance and captures most of dissolved lead in water. Phosphate incorporation improves charge transfers and passivates the buried perovskite interface, leading to highly improved device efficiency up to 23% with negligible hysteresis. More importantly, the phosphatized SnO2 layer shows high lead-adsorption capacity with a sequestration efficiency of 79.6% due to the numerous anchor sites of oxygen lone pairs, converting dissolved lead into insoluble compounds in water. This study presents a facile protocol of efficient and sustainable perovskite photovoltaics upon future commercialization.

Evaluation of Force Field Performance for High-Throughput Screening of Gas Uptake in Metal-Organic Frameworks	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							DISTRIBUTED MULTIPOLE ANALYSIS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CHARGE EQUILIBRATION; CO2; ADSORPTION; STORAGE; ROBUST; POTENTIALS; SEPARATION; MOLECULES	High-throughput computational screening is an increasingly useful approach to identify promising nanoporous materials for gas separation and adsorption applications. The reliability of the screening hinges on the accuracy of the underlying force fields, which is often difficult to access systematically. To probe the accuracy of common force fields and to assess the sensitivity of the screening results to this accuracy, we have computed CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption isotherms in 424 metalorganic frameworks using ab initio force fields and evaluated the contribution of electrostatic, van der Waals, and polarization interactions on the predicted gas uptake and the adsorption site probability distributions. While there are significant quantitative differences between gas uptake predicted by standard (generic) force fields (such as UFF) and ab initio force fields, the force fields predict similar ranking of the MOFs, supporting the further use of generic force fields in high-throughput screening studies. However, we also find that isotherm predictions of standard force fields may benefit from significant error cancellation resulting from overestimation of dispersion and neglect of polarization; as such, caution is warranted, as this error cancellation may vary among different classes of materials.

Then the fabricated membranes were modified with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solution. The prepared nanofiber membranes were characterized by ATR-FTIR, SEM and XRD. The diameters of the nanofibers were determined to be around 600-910 nm and beta-CD was successfully attached to the nanofiber membrane, which was confirmed by ATR-FTIR and XRD analysis. Cu(II) was selected as the model ion to investigate the heavy metal adsorption properties of the membranes. Adsorption capacities of the membranes increased with a higher initial pH, adsorption temperature and a longer adsorption time before reaching the saturation point. The adsorption isotherm results were described with the Langmuir model. It was found that additions of MBA and beta-CD at proper concentrations could significantly improve the adsorption capacities and the maximum adsorption of hordein, hordein/MBA, and hordein/MBA/beta-CD nanofiber membranes were 64.94, 81.97, and 88.50 mg/g, respectively. Furthermore, regeneration study showed that these hordein nanofiber membranes possessed reasonably good reusability. The novel functionalized hordein/MBA/beta-CD nanofiber membranes have great potential in the application of water treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Particle size of Cr powder has a significant effect oil the phase compositions and microstructures of SHS reaction products. The SI-IS reaction in Cr-Ti-B4C system with nano-size Cr goes more complete and occurs more easily than that in the system with micron-size Cr. Increase in particle size of B4C powder has a little effect on the phase compositions of SHS reaction products, which consist TiB2, TiC and Cr phases as well as transient phase Cr5B3 and a trace of C, but results in the increase of the amount of Cr5B3. Furthermore, the average sizes of TiB2 and TiC increase from similar to 0.5 and similar to 1 mu m to similar to 2 and similar to 3 mu m, respectively, as the B4C particle size increases from similar to 3.5 to 40 mu m. Increase in particle size of Ti powder (similar to 39, similar to 49 and similar to 74 mu m) has little influence oil the phase compositions of the products, as well as average sizes and morphologies of TiB2 and TiC.

In this study, biochar was derived from the pyrolysis (similar to 600 degrees C) of 11 plants that are widely distributed across the mid-west forest land of China. The three kinds of biochar with the highest cadmium (Cd) adsorption capacities were further investigated to establish their adsorption kinetics and isotherms. The results showed that biochar derived from walnut trees (W-Biochar), wild cherry trees (C-Biochar), and bamboo (B-Biochar) had the greatest adsorption capacity. Their order was B-Biochar (19.12 mg/g) > C-Biochar (18.8 mg g) > W-Biochar (18.06 mg/g). The optimal biochar dosage was 2 g/L at pH = 5. A pseudo-second-order model explained the adsorption kinetics with rate constants of 0.043 g center dot mg(-1)center dot min(-1) (B-Biochar), 0.321 g center dot mg(-1)center dot min(-1) (C-Biochar), and 0.157 g center dot mg(-1)center dot min(-1) (W-Biochar). It took 40 min to reach adsorption equilibrium, which was responsible for the Langmuir isotherm. The Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) results showed that the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the biochar surface improved Cd2+ adsorption. The scanning electron microscope results showed that the three biochars had different microstructures, which were probably responsible for their different adsorption capacities.

The conventional synthesis methods for MNPs/MMOs are complex and lack high-degree control over different compositional/structural parameters. Herein, we reported a general synthesis of MNP/MMO composites via a one-step, versatile sol-gel process under strongly acidic conditions. The successful introduction of stable, PVP-capped MNPs into the AcHE sol-gel system (Ac, H, and E represent acetic acid, HCl, and EtOH, respectively) allows us to synthesize a large variety of MNPs/MMOs (M = Pt, Au, Pd, and MMOs = TiO2, SiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3). In addition to the compositional variation, the preformed PVP-capped MNPs in the AcHE sol-gel system decouple the particle nucleation and inorganic-organic co-assembly processes, permitting a stabilization of the MNPs in the nano-scale range over a wide particle concentration. Meanwhile, structural regulation can also be achieved by variation of the block copolymer concentration. The high-degree control over different compositional/structural parameters of MNPs/MMOs provides a useful material candidate platform to further study their structure-property relationship for the design of a better catalyst for a specific reaction. The best Pt/Si-TiO2 catalyst for n-hexane combustion obtained in this study serves as an example to show that the control of the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products may be achieved by the optimization of composition and structure of the MNP/MMO catalysts, which may provide valuable insights for a detailed understanding of the structure-or composition-dependent chemical reactivity of the catalysts.

In this work, an intrinsically flexible palm-power TE generator based on the p-type PEDOT:PSS-based composite films has been designed and fabricated. The combination of inorganic nano-filler and chemical treatment have been proved to be an effective strategy for improving the TE performance of PEDOT:PSS. The maximum power factor of PEDOT:PSS composite with 5% content of (Ca0.85Ag0.15)(3)Co4O9 was evaluated to be 75.2 mu W m(-1) K-2 after H2SO4 post-treatment, which was three times higher than that of pure PEDOT:PSS. The resulting film with a good mechanical flexibility still sustained its good TE performance about 96% even after being flexed for 1000 bending cycles. Based on the parallel circuit design, the palm-power TE generator was assembled by the flexible composite films and realized a low internal resistance of 1.1 Omega and an acceptable output power of 36 nW in the palm of hand. This work may open new avenues on the design and fabrication of flexible wearable electronics for energy harvesting.

Excellent kinetic performance, high adsorption capacity, and selectivity are all critical for the utilization of adsorbents. This work presents a 4-bed PSA model for H-2/CO2 separation to evaluate the real-time H-2 purification capability of adsorbents with different kinetic performance, adsorption capacity, and selectivity. The experimental data on a test-scale PSA apparatus were used for model validation. The purity of H-2 at the outlet was exactly 99% and the H-2 recovery rate ranged from 70% to over 95%; hence, the extent of gas recovery was representative of the working performance. Theoretical analysis of the PSA process indicates that H-2 is discharged at the blow-down and purge steps, and that the amount of H-2 wasted in these steps is inversely proportional to the adsorption capacity and selectivity. This inverse relation was demonstrated by simulation, in which the correlation coefficient reached 0.99. When the kinetic performance was poor, the kinetic parameter k(a-CO2) was less than 0.1, and separation was highly dependent on the adsorption and desorption rate. When k(a-CO2) > 0.3, the dependency was not evident. The simulation results were used to analyze the limitations of the kinds of CO2 adsorbents, identify areas of improvement, and thus achieve better working performance.

In this work, based on density functional theory, O-2 adsorption and dissociation on SiC nanotubes and nanosheet are studied systematically. The results show that O-2 adsorption and dissociation are highly sensitive to the surface curvature of SiC nanomaterials. Both the O-2 adsorption energy and dissociation activation barrier energy increase as the curvature varying from negative to positive. These results may open a new avenue for modulating reaction dynamics via surface curvature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we evaluated the spatial variability of soil bulk density in the 0-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-100 cm layers as well as its affecting factors in Southwest China's agricultural intensive area. Results indicated the mean value of surface soil bulk density (0-20 cm) was 1.26 g cm(-3), significantly lower than that of subsoil (20-100 cm). No statistical difference existed among the subsoil with a mean soil bulk density of 1.54 g cm(-3). Spatially, soil bulk density played a similar spatial pattern in soil profile, whereas obvious differences were found in details. The nugget effects for soil bulk density in the 0-20 and 20-40 cm layers were 27.22 and 27.02% while 12.06 and 3.46% in the 40-60 and 60-100 cm layers, respectively, gradually decreasing in the soil profile, indicating that the spatial variability of soil bulk density above 40 cm was affected by structural and random factors while dominated by structural factors under 40 cm. Soil organic matter was the controlling factor on the spatial variability of soil bulk density in each layer. Land use and elevation were another two dominated factor controlling the spatial variability of soil bulk density in the 0-20 and 40-60 cm layers, respectively. Soil genus was one of the dominated factors controlling the spatial variability of soil bulk below 40 cm.

We investigate for the first time bismaleimide (BMI) toughening effect using the fabricated polymer, and a series of SHBEp/BMI thermosets are then constructed, and then their mechanical properties like impact strength, flexural strength, and thermal stability are studied; meanwhile the toughening effect of SHBEp and conventional epoxy resin E51 is also compared. The results indicate that a proper addition of SHBEp (8 wt%) can significantly improve the toughness and thermal performance of thermosets compared to E51 with the same content. It is, therefore, revealed that the polymer is promising to act as an effective BMI toughener. Unexpectedly, a bright blue photoluminescence is observed when the SHBEp is excited under 365 nm UV light, and its average fluorescence lifetime and absolute fluorescence quantum yield are 4.30 ns and 4.61% respectively. It is demonstrated by our primary investigation that the epoxide and hydroxyl groups simultaneously help the light emission. Thus, the SHBEp bearing unconventional chromophores is also particularly expected to be a new light-emitting material.

Both a-type and b-type transitions were observed for these two complexes. All transitions are doubled, due to the heavy water tunneling within the complexes. Assuming the tunneling splittings are the same in K-a = 0 and K-a = 1, the band origins, all three rotational and several distortion constants of each tunneling state were determined for N-2-D2O in the ground and excited vibrational states, and for OC-D2O in the excited vibrational state, respectively. The averaged band origin of OC-D2O is blueshifted by 2.241 cm(-1) from that of the v(2) band of the D2O monomer, compared with 1.247 cm(-1) for N-2-D2O. The tunneling splitting of N-2-D2O in the ground state is 0.16359(28) cm(-1), which is about five times that of OC-D2O. The tunneling splittings decrease by about 26% for N-2-D2O and 23% for OC-D2O, respectively, upon excitation of the D2O bending vibration, indicating an increase of the tunneling barrier in the excited vibrational state. The tunneling splittings are found to have a strong dependence on intramolecular vibrational excitation as well as a weak dependence on quantum number Ka. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

A comprehensive reaction network was developed on both the (111) and (100) facets of Pd, at CO coverages of 0 and 5/9 monolayer (ML). Pd(100) was determined to be more reactive than Pd(111) at both CO coverages. The introduction of 5/9 ML CO decreased the activity of both facets significantly, due to destabilization of the surface intermediates and transition states on the CO-decorated surfaces. Three reaction pathways were explored on the clean surfaces: the formate (HCOO) pathway, the carboxyl (COOH) pathway leading to the formation of CO2, and the COOH pathway leading to the formation of CO (COOH -> CO). Based on the DFT-derived energetics alone, it appears that all three pathways contribute to the reaction on clean Pd, whereas the presence of 5/9 ML of CO inhibits the HCOO pathway on both facets and favors the COOH -> CO pathway on the (111) facet, but the COOH -> CO2 one on the (100) facet. Moreover, at high CO coverages, alternative spectator CO-assisted adsorbate decomposition pathways were discovered, which could potentially play a role in formic acid decomposition on Pd catalysts under realistic reaction conditions.

Herein, hierarchical hollow MoS2 microspheres with enhanced performance for NO2 gas sensing were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The introduction of micro-nano hierarchical structure improved the exposure of active edge sites of MoS2 , and the efficiency of gas and carriers exchange and transportation during the reaction, which synthetically contribute the sensing performance enhancement. With additional optimization of reaction conditions, the hierarchical hollow MoS2 microspheres show excellent sensing performance with 3.1 times enhancement compared with the contrast sample of smooth solid structure. The rapid and sensitive response, decreased working temperature, as well as the prominent selectivity, enable the material with attractive sensing performance for NO2 detection. This study provides new opportunities on the surface morphology control at both the micro- and nanoscale for enhancing the sensing performance of MoS2.

The purpose of the present study is to explore the different reaction mechanisms induced by cations on the humic acid (HA) and montmorillonite (Mt) heteroaggregation and to analyze the binding mechanism of HA-Mt. Materials and methods HA is extracted from soil and colloidal Mt are prepared as K+-saturated. The aggregation kinetics of HA-Mt composite nanoparticles in Ca(NO3)(2), Mg(NO3)(2), and Cu(NO3)(2) solutions were detected by dynamic light scattering. Furthermore, FT-IR spectroscopy was used to characterize the reactive sites involved in interaction with the metal ions. Results and discussion The results revealed that the order of reaction of these three metal cations with the HA-Mt composite was Cu2+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+, as evident from the total average aggregation rate, critical coagulation concentration, and activation energy. The heteroaggregation process was sensitive to the 1% mass percentage of HA; however, more HA (4% mass percentage) did not significantly affect this process compared with 1% HA. Higher cation concentration and higher HA content (10% mass percentage) were two necessary conditions for promoting HA-Mt heteroaggregation. The vibration peak intensities of the carboxyl group C-O bonds and hydroxyl group O-H bonds of HA were affected by the formation of coordinate bonds with different metal ions. Conclusions Metal cations were preferentially complexed by the carboxyl groups of HA, and due to its polarization-induced and electric field-enhanced oxidizing properties, Cu2+ has the strongest aggregation ability for HA-Mt, followed by Ca2+ and Mg2+. The HA-Mt heteroaggregation is partially reversible by adjusting electrostatic repulsion. The results of this study improve our understanding of the roles of cations and HA in clay-humic substance interactions.

In this study, we conducted a drought-rehydration experiment to examine the physiological responses of ginkgo saplings. We aimed to integrate stomatal behavior, photosynthesis, abscisic acid (ABA), hydraulics, turgor loss, and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) content into a comprehensive sequence of physiological responses to drought and rehydration. Leaf ABA concentrations increased continuously under drought and were high even at the early stage of rehydration. The ABA concentration was negatively correlated with stomatal conductance and the net photosynthetic rate during drought and rehydration. In the late stage of rehydration, leaf gas exchange rapidly recovered with decreasing ABA during rehydration, suggesting that high concentrations of ABA inhibited gas exchange. The reduction in photosynthesis during drought and rehydration was attributed not only to stomatal limitation but also nonstomatal limitation. There was a negative correlation between ABA and NSC concentrations in leaves, regardless of drought or rehydration conditions. During drought, physiological thresholds, such as the turgor loss point, stomatal limitation and nonstomatal limitation transition and stomatal closure point, occurred sequentially, and the water potentials of these thresholds were all higher than P-50 (the water potential corresponding to 50% loss of xylem conductivity). In particular, ginkgo closed stomata well before the saplings significantly lost xylem hydraulic conductivity, indicating that ginkgo trees have a high safety margin and resistance to drought.

The results showed that the addition of poly(diallyl dimethylammonium chloride) significantly affected the textural and acid-base properties of hierarchical zeolite, which subsequently influenced the catalytic performance of hierarchical zeolite. In the aqueous phase, potassium-modified, hierarchical MFI zeolite (K/H-MFI-n) was more active for aldol condensation between furfural and levulinic acid than the potassium-modified, conventional MFI zeolite (K/MFI). This was ascribed to higher basic sites density and improved diffusion limitation of K/H-MFI-n. A 70.6% yield of aldol condensation product was achieved with a complete conversion of furfural at 100 degrees C for 9 h by K/H-MFI-0.6. However, only 27.4% yield of aldol condensation product with 55.1% furfural conversion was obtained by K/MFI at the same condition. Two major isomeric aldol products, beta-furfurylidenelevulinic acid and delta-furfurylidenelevulinic acid (beta-FDLA and delta-FDLA), were obtained after acidification. K/H-MFI-n displayed an enhanced selectivity (54.9%) to delta-FDLA, owing to the stronger basicity of K/H-MFI-n. However, K/MFI showed a preferred selectivity to beta-FDLA (42.7%), owing to the dominant Lewis acidity. Recyclability research showed that the catalytic performance of potassium-modified, hierarchical MFI zeolite was acceptable after five runs.

Herein, we report a novel solvent-mediated synthetic strategy for preparing oxygen-doped bundlelike porous boron nitride (OBPBN) through a simple two-step template-free reaction that involves thermal evaporation of the solvent and high-temperature pyrolysis processes. The resulting OBPBN with an interconnected mesoporous microstructure exhibits excellent adsorption performance for various heavy metal ions including Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, and Cr3+. In particular, the exceptional selectivity for the extraction of Cu2+ (427.12 mg/g) and Pb2+ (316.32 mg/g) places the as-obtained OBPBN among the top boron nitride-based adsorbent materials. The high adsorption performance for heavy metals is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of oxidizing groups and lattice defects induced by oxygen doping as well as the high specific surface area (474.3 m(2)/g) and porosity (0.332 cm(3)/g) originating from the OBPBN. In addition, the excellent reusability of the OBPBN has been also confirmed. The current synthetic approach would lead to a facile and high throughput fabrication of porous boron nitride materials for future applications in environment remediation, such as the extraction of heavy metals from waste and polluted water.

In this study, a series of Fe-doped LaNiO3 perovskites with various Ni/Fe ratios (LaNixFe1-xO3 (0 <= x <= 1)) were investigated for chemical looping steam reforming of acetic acid as a model compounds of bio-oil. Results illustrated that although LaNiO3 showed higher activity for gas production, the Ni-Fe bimetallic perovskites were more stable during the steam reforming reactions. It was found that Fe doping can promote the content of lattice oxygen in the perovskite which could be released during the steam reforming reaction, thus coking resistant of the perovskite was effectively improved. Among the LaNixFe1-xO3 (0 <= x <= 1) perovskites, LaNi0.8Fe0.2O3 exhibited the best synergistic effect between Ni and Fe to achieve the highest H-2/CO for H-2-rich gas production. Operational variables of the steam reforming reactions catalyzed by LaNi0.8Fe0.2O3 for H-2 production were further optimized. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we evaluated the use of visible near-infrared shortwave-infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR: 400-2500 nm) spectroscopy for the assessment of NFR to provide necessary information for fast, cost-effective and precise fertilization rating. Over 2000 samples were collected from paddy-rice fields in 10 Chinese provinces; samples were added to the Chinese Soil Spectral Library (CSSL). Two kinds of modeling strategies for NFR, quantitative estimation of soil N prior to classification and qualitative by classification, were employed using partial least squares regression (PLSR), locally weighted regression (LWR), and support vector machine discriminant analogy (SVMDA). Overall, both LWR and SVMDA had moderate accuracies with Cohen's kappa coefficients of 0.47 and 0.48, respectively, while PLSR had fair accuracy (0.37). We conclude that VIS-NIR-SWIR spectroscopy coupled with the CSSL appears to be a viable, rapid means for the assessment of NFR in paddy-rice soil. Based on qualitative classification of soil spectral data only, it is recommended that the SVMDA be adopted for rapid implementation.

With the accelerated pace of life, non-invasive cortisol detection at the point of care (POC) is in high demand for personal health monitoring. In this paper, an ultrasensitive immunosensor using gold nanoparticles/molybdenum disulfide/gold nanoparticles (AuNPs/MoS2/AuNPs) as transducer was explored for non-invasive salivary cortisol monitoring at POC with the miniaturized differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) system based on a smartphone. Covalent binding of cortisol antibody (CORT-Ab) onto the AuNPs/MoS2/AuNPs transducer was achieved through the self-assembled monolayer of specially designed polyethylene glycol (PEG, SH-PEG-COOH). Non-specific binding was avoided by passivating the surface with ethanolamine. The miniaturized portable DPV system was utilized for human salivary cortisol detection. A series current response of different cortisol concentrations decreased and exhibited a linear range of 0.5-200 nM, the detection limit of 0.11 nM, and high sensitivity of 30 mu A M-1 with a regression coefficient of 0.9947. Cortisol was also distinguished successfully from the other substances in saliva. The recovery ratio of spiked human salivary cortisol and the variation of salivary cortisol level during one day indicated the practicability of the immunosensor based on the portable system. The results demonstrated the excellent performance of the smartphone-based immunosensor system and its great potential application for non-invasive human salivary cortisol detection at POC.

The factors that influence the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) with BFO/NFs as catalysts are optimized to improve the catalytic activity in a microwave-enhanced Fenton-like process. BFO/NF exhibit a superior catalytic activity with a high BPA removal ratio (98.4%) and TOC removal ratio (69.5%) within 5 min. Results indicate that NF significantly affect the improvement of the catalytic activity of BFO because it served as a source of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) during degradation. The amount of center dot OH generated by BFO/NF is approximately 1.65-fold higher than that by pure BFO. After six reaction cycles, the stability and reusability of center dot OH remain high. These findings provide new insights into the synthesis of composites on heterogeneous catalysts with high efficiency and easy recyclability for water treatment applications.

A photo-tunable membrane based on inter-particle crosslinking for decreasing diffusion rates	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B			English	Article							DYNAMIC-MECHANICAL ANALYSIS; CONTROLLED-RELEASE; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; CARBON NANOTUBES; DRUG-RELEASE; DELIVERY; HYDROGELS; POLYMERS; COATINGS; ACID	Functional polymeric membranes are widely used to adjust and control the diffusion of molecules. Herein, photosensitive poly(hydroxycinnamic acid) (PHCA) microspheres, which were fabricated by an emulsification solvent-evaporation method, were embedded into an ethyl cellulose matrix to fabricate composite membranes with a photo-tunable property. The photoreaction of PHCA is based on the [2 + 2] cycloaddition of cinnamic moieties upon irradiation with 365 nm light. Intra-particle crosslinking in PHCA microspheres was confirmed in the solution phase, while inter-particle crosslinking between adjacent PHCA microspheres dominated the solid membrane phase. The inter-particle crosslinking turned down the permeability of the composite membranes by 74%. To prove the applicability of the designed system, the composite membrane was coated on a model drug reservoir tablet. Upon irradiating the tablet with UV light, the original permeability decreased by 57%, and consequently the diffusion rate of the cargo (Rhodamine B) from the tablet slowed down. Most importantly, the tablet showed sustained release for over 10 days. This controllability can be further tuned by adjusting the membrane thickness. Composite membranes showed excellent processing reproducibility together with consistent mechanical properties. These results demonstrate that the incorporation of photosensitive PHCA microspheres in polymeric membranes provides a promising photo-tunable material for different applications including coating and separation.

In this study, nanocomposites of two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles were synthesized by a one-step green process. Under irradiation, 2D MoS2 in the nanocomposites absorbed photons and generated carriers in a wide spectrum. Then MoS2 coupled to gold nanoparticles and produced the enhanced electromagnetic field in the nanosturctures, leading to outstanding optical properties. In virtue of bio-compatibilities of the particles, the nanocomposites were chemically modified with specific peptides to construct an optical biosensor for explosive detection. When exposed to 2,4,6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), the biosensor showed significant absorption peak changes in visible spectra with a concentration-dependent behavior. The biosensor could detect TNT at the concentration as low as 2 x 10(-7) M. For selectivity, the biosensor could differentiate TNT from other nitroaromatic explosives that have extremely similar structures to TNT, such as 4-nitrotoluene (4-NT) and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (DNT). All the results suggested that the biosensor based on the nanocomposites of 2D MoS2 coupling to plasmonic nanoparticles exhibited remarkable optical performance, which provided a promising approach to design versatile biosensors to detect biochemical molecules.

The discovery of drug candidates that act on new targets of PD is required to address the varied pathological aspects and modify the disease process. In this study, a small compound, 2-(5-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-N-(5-propylsulfanyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) acetamide (MBPTA) was identified as a novel Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor with significant protective effects against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP)-induced damage in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Further investigation showed that pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MBPTA significantly suppressed MPP -induced cell death by restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential, and numerous apoptotic regulators. MBPTA was able to inhibit MPP+ induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)/NO generation, overexpression of inducible NO synthase, and activation of NF-kappa B, indicating the critical role of MBPTA in regulating ROS/NO-mediated cell death. Furthermore, MBPTA was shown to activate PI3K/Akt survival signaling, and its cytoprotective effect was abolished by PI3K and Akt inhibitors. The structural comparison of a series of MBPTA analogs revealed that the benzofuran moiety probably plays a crucial role in the anti-oxidative stress action. Taken together, these results suggest that MBPTA protects against MPP -induced apoptosis in a neuronal cell line through inhibition of ROS/NO generation and activation of PI3K/Akt signaling.

This novel precursor is synthesized from commercial hydrotalcite, one kind of LDH, undergoing acid-aid anionic exchange and wet impregnation processes. The pillared stearate expands the gallery height from 0.28 nm for carbonate-intercalated LDH (almost the diameter of the K ion, 0.276 nm) to a much spatial 3.4 nm for stearate-intercalated LDH, proven by characteristic diffraction peaks in powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) provide a vivid layout of K and its on-spot composition, respectively, deducing that a well-dispersed K ion promotion exists inside brucite-like layers.

This paper describes the combined chemo- and photothermal therapy of cancer based on PDA@(PDDA-ADA) 3-Dox nanocomposites. Polydopamine (PDA) serves not only as photothermal agent with strong near infrared absorbance and high energy conversion efficiency, but also as a core material to carry multilayer films formed by alternatively deposition of positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and negatively charged alginate dialdehyde (ADA) through layer-by-layer (LBL) method. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox) was loaded to the PDA@(PDDA-ADA) 3 nanoplatform via Schiff base bond and electrostatic interaction. The fabricated PDA@(PDDA-ADA)(3)-Dox nanocomposites exhibit outstanding pH-sensitive drug release, good biocompatibility and high photothermal conversion efficiency. These features make them achieve excellent anticancer therapeutic efficacy by combined chemo- and photothermal therapy. This work points that the PDA-based nanoplatform can be a universal scaffold for cancer treatment.

Herein, we present a ratiometric fluorescent sensing strategy based on an aptamer labeled with a fluorescent dye and a highly stable zirconium-porphyrin MOF (PCN-222) as a fluorescence quencher for the high-efficiency detection of chloramphenicol (CAP). PIN-222 exhibits a strong adsorption ability toward the dye-labeled aptamer through pi-pi stacking, electrostatic, hydrogen bond, and coordination interactions. Experimental and simulation studies confirm that PCN-222 demonstrates a high quenching efficiency via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and photoinduced electron transfer (PET) processes. In the presence of CAP, dye-labeled aptamers are released from the PCN-222 surface, resulting in the recovery of fluorescence. This proposed biosensor allows the complete detection of CAP within 26 min. For ratiometric measurement, its detection limit is as low as 0.08 pg mL(-1) with a wide detection range from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1). It is successfully applied to analyze CAP in milk and shrimp samples, and its results are consistent with those of the commercial ELISA kit. This biosensor not only enables the rapid, ultrasensitive, and highly specific detection of CAP but also reveals excellent universality and multiplexed analysis performance.

In recent years, there have been more and more research papers on tracing Chinese medicinal materials by stable isotope and mineral element analysis combined with chemometrics. Using stable isotope and mineral element analysis to trace traditional Chinese medicinal materials has the advantages of high accuracy and strong reliability. Through chemometrics methods, medicinal materials from different origins can be classified, distinguished, and modeled, and finally the purpose of origin traceability can be achieved. Based on the introduction of the basic principles of stable isotopes and mineral elements, this article systematically analyzes the research and application of relevant stable isotope and mineral element analysis techniques in the origin traceability of Chinese medicinal materials in the past 10 years, and proposes the existing problems in origin traceability of Chinese medicinal materials. This article aims at providing reference for the origin traceability, confirmation and supervision of Chinese herbal medicines, and promoting the establishment and improvement of the traceability technical system of Chinese herbal medicines.

The particle emission intensity was recorded by a high-speed camera in different flame conditions. Particle temperature was derived through two-color pyrometry method employing an ICCD camera equipped with a stereoscope. Based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, the microstructure change of iron particles was investigated. Results showed that the temperature of burning particle rose rapidly and was much higher than the ambient temperature. The fresh iron particles mainly went through several stages in hot gas flow: heating, melting, rapid combustion and cooling. Some of them became bright again after cooling. According to the above combustion process, combustion parameters including ignition delay time, accelerated burning time, total burning time and second stage of combustion time were defined. All the above defined parameters were almost linearly increasing with the increase of particle size under the same oxygen concentration. For iron particles with roughly the same size, the ignition delay time, accelerated burning time and total burning time decreased as the effective oxygen concentration increased especially for particle size larger than 40 mu m. The second stage of combustion time for particles with similar size were almost the same under different oxygen concentrations. After combustion, most of the particles change from irregular shape to spherical or ellipsoidal shape, and some of them showed hollow shell structure. A phenomenon of nano-sized particles releasing during the iron particles combustion had been identified. The frequently observed luminous tail was attributed to coming from the thermal radiation of the formed nanoparticles, which was supported by the SEM sampling analysis of the combustion products.(c) 2022 The Combustion Institute.

However, these 2D sheets tend to stack and therefore lose their active surface area and functions. Herein, an amorphous cobalt nickel boride (Co-Ni-B) nanocomposite is prepared with a combination of 2D sheets and nano particles in the center to avoid agglomeration. This unique structure holds the 2D nano sheets with massive surface area which contains numerous catalytic active sites. This nanocomposite is prepared as an electrocatalyst for borohydride electrooxidation reaction (BOR). It shows outstanding catalytic activity through improving the kinetic parameters of BH4- oxidation, owing to abundant ultrathin 2D structure on the surface, which provide free interspace and electroactive sites for charge/mass transport. The anode catalyst led to a 209 mW/cm(2) maximum power density with high open circuit potential of 1.06 Vat room temperature in a miniature direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC). It also showed a great longevity of up to 45 h at an output power density of 64 mW/cm(2), which is higher than the Co-B, Ni-B and PtRu/C. The cost reduction and prospective scale-up production of the Co-Ni-B catalyst are also addressed. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, we report a green and facile strategy to prepare amorphous and hierarchically structured CSH-based nanocomposites from steel slag for heavy metal removal. The obtained flowerlike CSH-based materials showed fast adsorption rates and superior adsorption capacities for all employed heavy metal ions (Cu(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II)), with maximum adsorption capacities of approximately 244, 273, and 508 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption kinetics were all well fitted to the pseudo-second order model, and the adsorption equilibrium fitted the Langmuir model. The excellent adsorption performance could be attributed to the release of Ca2+ and OH- from the CSH nanosheets. Moreover, as a case study, the obtained CSH-Cu(II) after absorption can be converted and reused as an photocatalyst by simply heating at 300 degrees C, which shows an excellent degradation efficiency of similar to 90% for methylene blue within 150 min under simulated sunlight irradiation. This work lays the foundation for the development of an environmentally friendly route of "solid waste -> adsorbent -> catalyst", which will be of great significance for solid waste utilization as well as water purification.

Due to the highly inert character of CH4, the selective cleavage of its first C-H bond without over-oxidation is essential for transforming CH4 into value-added products. In this work, we developed an efficient and selective CH4 conversion approach at room temperature using intermediate chlorine species (*Cl), which were electrochemically generated and stabilized on mixed cobalt-nickel spinels with different Co/Ni ratios. The lower overpotentials for *Cl formation enabled an effective activation and conversion of CH4 to CH3Cl without over-oxidation to CO2, and Ni3+ at the octahedral sites in the mixed cobalt-nickel spinels allowed to stabilize surface-bound *Cl species. The CoNi2Ox electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding yield of CH3Cl (364 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) and a high CH3Cl/CO2 selectivity of over 400 at room temperature, with demonstrated capability of direct CH4 conversion under seawater working conditions.

An in-depth understanding of this phenomenon will deepen the knowledge of electrode material design and optimize rechargeable Li batteries. In this context, the phase transition from dense stage II (LiC12) to stage I (LiC6) was comprehensively elucidated in a graphite anode via both experimental characterizations and first-principles calculations. The results indicate that, although the transition from stage II to stage I is thermodynamically allowed, the process is kinetically prohibited because Li ions tend to cluster into stage compounds rather than form a solid solution. Additionally, the phase transitions involve at least three intermediate structures (1T, 2H, and 3R) before reaching the LiC6 (stage I) phase. These findings provide new insights into the electrochemical behavior of graphite and the electrode process kinetics for rechargeable Li batteries.

The structure and composition of PHM were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The potential of PHM as flame retardant was verified by thermogravimetric analysis (TG). Then, the flame retardancy and toxicity reduction of PHM in TPU/PHM composites were verified by cone calorimeter test (CCT) and Thermogravimetric Analysis-infrared Spectrometry (TG-IR). It has been found that comparing TPU/PHM-4 sample containing 4.0 wt% PHM with pure TPU, the peak heat release rate (pHRR) was reduced by 61.6%, the total smoke release (TSR) by 23.2%, and the CO production by 86.2%, respectively. The SEM, Laser Raman Spectroscopy Test (LRS), and other tests were carried out to test the char residues after CCT, and the mechanism of PHM in the process of flame retardant TPU was reasonably deduced. In a word, PHM is very effective as a flame retardant of TPU.	[Jiao, C. M.; Zhang, Y. L.; Dong, H. X.; Chen, W. J.; Liu, W.; Li, S. X.; Chen, X.

Herein, we obtained a delignified SCG (D-SCG) by using an aqueous solution of 3 wt% NaOH for 1 h at 90 degrees C and then an aqueous solution of 3 wt% NaClO2 buffered with acetic acid at pH 4.3 for 2 h at 90 degrees C, respectively. Next, we used the D-SCG to fabricate holocellulose nanofibers (HCNF) suspension by TEMPO-Mediated oxidation. Finally, HCNF suspension was manufactured into superhydrophobic foams for oil-water separation through freeze-drying and hydrophobic modification. The superhydrophobic foams showed good properties of oil absorption capacity (16 g/g), separation efficiency (98.5%) and continuous separation. This work presents a novel idea for the further application of SCG and provides an eco-friendly and sustainable oil absorbent material to solve oil spill. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The green revolution varieties (GRVs) accumulate more growth-repressing DELLA proteins (DELLAs) owing to mutant alleles at the Rht (wheat) and SD1 (rice) loci, which results in semi-dwarfism and GRV resistance to "lodging" under high levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization. However, GRV DELLAs accumulation confers reduced N-use efficiency (NUE). Achievement of high GRV yield requires excessive use of N fertilizer inputs that unsustainably damage the environment. Therefore, developing new breeding strategies to cut fertilizer use in high-yield cereal crops is an urgent global sustainable agriculture goal. Recently, we showed that the rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4) is a positive regulator of N-responsive plant growth and N assimilation, and GRF4 could counteract SLR1-mediated inhibition of N-metabolism. The further experiments demonstrated that homeostatic co-regulation of plant C-N ratio is conferred by balanced activities and physical interaction of GRF4 and the DELLAs. GRF4 promotes and integrates N assimilation, C fixation and plant growth, whilst DELLA inhibits them. Importantly, we showed that increased GRV GRF4 abundance alters the GRF4-DELLA balance to favour increased C and N assimilation without loss of yield-enhancing dwarfism, thus sustainably boosting dwarfism-conferred GRV yield-gains. Therefore, modulating coordination of plant growth and metabolism thus elevates NUE and yield, enabling strategic breeding for sustainably increased global food security, yet reducing environmentally degrading agricultural nitrogen use. This minireview discusses the latest advances in the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the improvement of NUE. In addition, N sensing, signaling and responses are complicatedly regulated by various positive and negative components. Thus, identification of new components in the regulation of N metabolism and signaling using systems-wide approaches and the understanding of the cross-talk with other nutrient and phytohormone signaling will provide new strategies for future sustainable food security and a new green revolution.

Synthesis, Pelleting, and Performance Evaluation of a Novel K-Promoted gamma-Alumina/MgAl-Layered Double Oxide Composite Adsorbent for Warm Gas H-2/CO2 Separation	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							CO2 CAPTURE; ACTIVATED HYDROTALCITES; CARBON-DIOXIDE; SORPTION; ADSORPTION; TEMPERATURE; HYDROGEN; WATER; ETHANOL; SHIFT	Development of stable solid adsorbent in pellet form is of importance for CO2/H-2 separation at elevated temperature (250-450 degrees C). This study provides a novel synthesis method by adding K2CO3 solution into alumina sol soaked MgAl-layered double hydroxide paste. The delay time of K2CO3 addition is studied to demonstrate that the formation of K-promoted gamma-alumina is facilitated by an immediate addition. Extruded adsorbent of higher CO2 capacity (0.65 mmol/g) and radial crushing strength (75.6 N per pellet) is obtained. The existing crystalline phase of obtained adsorbent is screened by X-ray diffraction. The adsorption capacity and adsorption kinetics of the developed adsorbent is characterized by a thermogravimetric analyzer in terms of calcination temperature of both dominant constituent materials, MG63 hydrotacite, and K-promoted pseudo boehmite. Crystal transit temperatures of the constituents are considered in selecting the optimal calcinations temperature. The adsorbent pellets, pretreated with the optimal parameters studied, are packed in a fixed-bed to test breakthrough curves of CO2, consistent dynamic capacity compared to that of thermogravimetric testing data were obtained. Results of multicycle CO2 adsorption and desorption, steam sweeping, pressure change, and wear tests prove the stability of the adsorbent both in CO2 capacity and mechanical strength.

By doping Al and Ti, the as-cast (Ni3.5Co3Cr1.5)(90)Al5Ti5 high-entropy alloy (AT5) exhibits enhanced strength-ductility synergy. Compared to AT0 alloy, the yield strength of AT5 alloy increases more than fivefold to 792 MPa, ultimate tensile strength doubles to 1004 MPa, and still remaining a high elongation of 38.2%. The apparent increase in strength can be attributed to uniformly distributed, high-content, conherent (Ni,Co)(3)(Al,Ti)-type nanoprecipitates formed in FCC matrix. The formation of various dislocation substructures and crossed stacking faults (SFs) with Lomer-Cottrell locks during tensile deformation is responsible for strain hardening of AT5 alloy.

Stable isotope and component analyses of gas and water samples from the No. 2 coal seam of 17 CBM wells were performed to determine the correlations between stable isotopes of gases and co-produced water, and to understand the controls of structure and hydrology on isotope distribution. The results show that the co-produced water continuously ranges from brackish, isotopically lighter Na-HCO3/Na-HCO3-Cl water to hypersaline, isotopically heavier Na-Cl/Na-Ca-Cl brine. Based on the hydrochemical features, fault development, and burial depth of coal seam, four structure-controlled hydrodynamic zones are distinguished, including strong through-flow, medium through-flow, weak through-flow, and stagnant zones. The gas isotope analysis shows that thermogenic methane is the dominant source of CBM, and secondary biogenic gases only exist in the strong through-flow zone. delta H-2-CH4 is ultimately inherited from formation water, and more H-2 can be transferred during the formation of thermogenic gases. delta C-13-CH4 and delta C-13-CO2 are mainly controlled by thermal maturity and gas genesis respectively, and there is a negative correlation between them. The stable isotopes of coalbed gases and water show strong spatial heterogeneity with the changing hydrodynamic strength. Owing to the influence of water recharge, gas leakage, and secondary biogas formation, the strong through-flow zone is characterized by the most negative delta(1)3C-CH4, delta H-2-CH4, delta O-18-H2O, delta H-2-H2O and the most positive delta C-13-CO2, Delta H-2-(H2O-CH4) and Delta C-13-(CO2-CH4). However, the stagnant zone has maintained stable in a long geological period, which leads to the high concentration of original connate water and mass preservation of coalbed gases, and hence its isotopic feature is completely opposite to the strong through-flow zone. This study confirms the significant controls of hydrogeological conditions on the migration of water and gas and the application of isotopic indicators in the exploration of deep CBM.

A Physically Based Constitutive Model and Continuous Dynamic Recrystallization Behavior Analysis of 2219 Aluminum Alloy during Hot Deformation Process	MATERIALS			English	Article						2219 aluminum alloy; constitutive model; microstructural evolution; continuous dynamic recrystallization; hot deformation	HIGH-TEMPERATURE DEFORMATION; FLOW BEHAVIOR; MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION; 42CRMO STEEL; TENSILE DEFORMATION; MAGNESIUM ALLOY; MEDIUM-CARBON; PREDICTION; STRESS; MECHANISM	The isothermal compression tests of the 2219 Al alloy were conducted at the temperature and the strain rate ranges of 623-773 K and 0.01-10 s(-1), respectively, and the deformed microstructures were observed. The flow curves of the 2219 Al alloy obtained show that flow stress decreases with the increase in temperature and/or the decrease in strain rate. The physically based constitutive model is applied to describe the flow behavior during hot deformation. In this model, Young's modulus and lattice diffusion coefficient are temperature-dependent, and the creep exponent is regarded as a variable. The predicted values calculated by the constitutive model are in good agreement with the experimental results. In addition, it is confirmed that the main softening mechanism of the 2219 Al alloy during hot deformation is dynamic recovery and incomplete continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) by the analysis of electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) micrographs. Moreover, CDRX can readily occur under the condition of high temperatures, low strain rates, and large strains. Meanwhile, the recrystallization grain size will also be larger.

Although Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3) (LAGP) has satisfied ionic conductivity at room temperature (similar to 10(-4) S cm(-1)), high stability in air, and can be easily sintered, it still suffers from instability of the lithium metal. Moreover, the large interfacial resistance between solid electrolytes and solid electrodes and the stress generated by the volumetric change of lithium metal anodes during cycling would deteriorate the performance of LMBs. Here, we report an effective solution to overcome the abovementioned problems by introducing a three-dimensional gel polymer electrolyte at the interface between LAGP pellets and lithium metal anodes, achieving stable cycling of LiFePO4//Li cells at room temperature for 300 cycles. Besides, the degeneration mechanisms of the interfaces of LAGP pellets under different conditions are compared, and peculiar properties different from their counterparts were found.

Although many efforts have been focused on composites, complicated methods are real hindrance to the development of TE materials. Here, we demonstrate a potential TE thin film comprising highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and chemically exfoliated MoS2 (ce-MoS2) nanosheets by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly method. This work achieves the effective integration of composite, treatment, and electron transfer based on the advantages of PEDOT:PSS and ce-MoS2. On the one hand, the negative charged ce-MoS2 nanosheets facilitate the formation of heterostructure TE films with positive charged PEDOT and reduce the oxidation level of PEDOT, which would favor an enhanced thermopower (21.9 mu V K-1). On the other hand, the simultaneous enhancement in the electrical conductivity (867 S cm(-1)) of PEDOT:PSS/ce-MoS2 composite film is caused by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) worked as the dispersion of ce-MoS2, which corresponds to the removal of the excess nonconductive PSS and the molecular conformation arrangement of PEDOT:PSS. This LbL assembly method incorporating electron-rich ce-MoS2 and DMSO has been confirmed to be an effective strategy to yield a simultaneous enhancement of electrical conductivity and thermopower. The optimized power factor is achieved to be 41.6 mu W m(-1) K-2 at the layer number of 4, which surpass that of the single-layer PEDOT:PSS film by a factor of 5. This work may provide a fundamental understanding of and design principles on how to build PEDOT:PSS-based composite films with highly enhanced TE performance, which can be potentially used in TE energy harvesting systems.

Furthermore, the chemical and physical properties, hemostatic ability, biocompatibility and cytotoxicity were investigated in vitro. In this work, the in vivo hemostatic performance, wound healing, hemocompatibility, histocompatibility, and biodegradability were evaluated by a series of experiments. The results showed that CSCM could both stop bleeding and enhance healing efficiency by accelerating the clotting and the wound closure rate, suggesting that CSCM acts as a hemostat, and enhances wound healing. In addition, the CSCM material had negligible intracutaneous stimulation reactions and no obvious hemolytic reactions. More importantly, CSCM can be degraded in vivo without significant impacts on physiology, biochemistry, and organization. Thus, CSCM may be a useful tool to stop bleeding in emergency conditions in both military and civilian settings.

This paper presents an integrated observation of a significant ABB episode in Nanjing, China, during early June 2011, using combined ground-based and satellite sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), and Ozone Monitoring Instrument products). The time-height distribution, optical properties, sources and transport of smoke, and its impacts on air quality are investigated. Lidar profiles indicate that the smoke aerosols are confined to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and have a depolarization ratio of less than 0.08. The aerosol optical depths increase from 0.5 to 3.0 at 500 nm, while the extinction-related Angstrom exponent increases from 1.1 to 1.6 at the wavelength pair of 440-870 nm. The single-scattering albedo becomes lower at 670-1020nm following the ABB intrusion and particularly shows a decreasing tendency between wavelengths of 440 to 1020 nm. The absorption Angstrom exponent (0.7) is smaller than 1.0, which may indicate the aged smoke particles mixed or coated with the urban aerosols. Surface particular matter PM10 and PM2.5 show a dramatic increase, reaching hourly mean of 800 mu g/m(3) and 485 mu g/m(3), respectively, which results in a heavy air pollution event. The stagnant and high-moisture weather provides favorable conditions for the aerosols to accumulate near the surface. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) also illustrate that the large-scale aerosols are primarily present in the PBL and transported to the ocean, but some dense smoke plumes are misclassified as cloud or polluted dust. By comparing with the observations, we found that the Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry model captured the accumulation and downwind transport of surface PM2.5 from 20: 00 on 2 June to 10: 00 on 3 June (phase 1) but showed a dramatic underestimate from 20: 00 on 3-4 June (phase 2) when dense aerosols are present. Such a discrepancy in the model is associated with the improper vertical apportion of transported smoke and atmospheric diffusion conditions when comparing with the observed aerosol and wind profiles. In addition, the model simulations indicate that the transported smoke can contribute to 50-70% of the ground-level PM2.5 in Nanjing.

The effects of pore size, volume density and metal arris thickness on the tensile properties of nickel foam/polyurethane co-continuous composites were investigated. The relationship between the tensile strength and elongation at break of the composite and the structural parameters of the nickel foam was established, which can be used to estimate the tensile strength and elongation at break of the composite. The nickel foam reinforced composite with moderate metal arris wall thickness had high elongation at break, and the metal phase and the resin phase had good synergistic deformation ability, which can effectively improve the tensile properties of the composite. While increasing the strength, the metal skeleton also had a good toughening effect on the polyurethane.	[Wang, J. X.; Duan, D. L.; Yang, X. G.; Li, M.

Enhancement of mechanical properties of poly(vinyl chloride) with polymethyl methacrylate-grafted halloysite nanotube	EXPRESS POLYMER LETTERS			English	Article						nanocomposites; halloysite nanotubes; poly(vinyl chloride); surface modification; polymethyl methacrylate	IN-SITU POLYMERIZATION; MATRIX COMPOSITES; CARBON NANOTUBES; NANOCOMPOSITES; PERFORMANCE; POLYPROPYLENE; CLAY	Halloysite nanotubes(HNTs) grafted with Polymethyl methacrylate(PMMA) were synthesized via radical polymerization. The properties of PMMA-grafted HNTs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that PMMA grafted to the surfaces of HNTs successfully. Then, PVC/PMMA-grafted HNTs nanocomposites were prepared by melt compounding. The morphology, mechanical properties and thermal properties of the nanocomposites were investigated. PMMA-grafted HNTs can effectively improve the toughness, strength and modulus of PVC. The glass transition and thermal decomposition temperatures of PVC phase in PVC/PMMA-grafted HNTs nanocomposites are shifted toward slightly higher temperatures. The grafted HNTs were uniformly dispersed in PVC matrix as revealed by TEM photos. The fracture surfaces of the nanocomposites exhibited plastic deformation feature indicating ductile fracture behaviors. The improvement of toughness of PVC by PMMA-grafted HNTs was attributed to the improved interfacial bonding by grafting and the toughening mechanism was explained according to the cavitation mechanism.

In this study, in-situ-fabricated magnetic MIL-53(Al) metal organic frameworks (MOFs), with good magnetic responsiveness, were synthesized and applied for the magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) of chloramphenicol, bisphenol A, estradiol, and diethylstilbestrol. Terephthalic acid (H2BDC) organic ligands were pre-coupled on the surface of amino-Fe3O4 composites (H2BDC@Fe3O4). Fe3O4@MIL-53(Al) MOF was fabricated by in-situ hydrothermal polymerization of H2BDC, Al (NO3)(3), and H2BDC@Fe3O4. This approach highly increased the stability of the material. The magnetic Fe3O4@MIL-53(Al) MOF-based MSPE was combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-photo diode array detection, to establish a novel sensitive method for analyzing multi-pollutant residues in milk. This method showed good linear correlations, in the range of 0.05-5.00 mu g/mL, with good reproducibility. The limit of detection was 0.004-0.108 mu g/mL. The presented method was verified using a milk sample, spiked with four pollutants, which enabled high-throughput detection and the accuracies of 88.17-107.58% confirmed its applicability, in real sample analysis.

We found that the ethanol molecules form several solvation shells around the central fullerene molecule. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) and hydrogen-bond analyses were employed to detect the structure of the ethanol molecules in the solvation shells. The ethanol molecules in the first solvation shell tend to have their nonpolar alkyl groups exposed to the C-60 surface while the polar hydroxyl groups point outward to maintain a hydrogen-bond network with a clathrate-like structure. Such orientation of the ethanol molecules in the first solvation shell modulates the orientation of the ethanol molecules in the second solvation shell to have the hydroxyl groups pointing inward. The potential of mean force (PMF) between two C-60 molecules in ethanol solution showed that C-60 molecules tend to aggregate in the ethanol solution. There is no ethanol molecule in the intersolute area if the distance between the centers of mass of two C-60 molecules is shorter than 10.2 angstrom. The ethanol molecules near the intersolute area tend to have their methyl groups penetrating into the intersolute region if the distance between two C-60 molecules is short, although the hydroxyl,groups have smaller volume. We analyzed the dynamic properties of the ethanol molecules in different solvation shells and found that the relaxation is much slower than that of water solution of C-60 molecules. In addition, the relaxation of the first solvation shell is slower than that in other solvation shells. The lifetime of the hydrogen-bond in the first solvation shell is also longer than that in other solvation shells while the reorientation of the hydrogen-bonded ethanol pair contributes little to break the hydrogen-bonds.

First-principles study of bulk and two-dimensional structures of the AMnBi family of materials (A = K, Rb, Cs)	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; MONOLAYER; METAL; FERROMAGNETISM; DISCOVERY; MOBILITY; SCHEMES; CARBON	Magnetic materials with high mobilities are intriguing subjects of research from both fundamental and application perspectives. Based on first-principle calculations, we investigate the physical properties of the already synthesized AMnBi (A = K, Rb, Cs) family materials. We show that these materials are antiferromagnetic (AFM), with Ned temperatures above 300 K. They contain AFM ordered Mn layers, while the interlayer coupling changes from ferromagnetic (FM) for KMnBi to AFM for RbMnBi and CsMnBi. We find that these materials are narrow gap semiconductors. Owing to the small effective mass, the electron carrier mobility can be very high, reaching up to 10(5) cm(2)/(V s) for KMnBi. In contrast, the hole mobility is much suppressed, typically lower by two orders of magnitude. We further study their two-dimensional (2D) single layer structures, which are found to be AFM with fairly high mobility similar to 10(3) cm(2)/(V s). Their Ned temperatures can still reach room temperature. Interesting, we find that the magnetic phase transition is also accompanied by a metal-insulator phase transition, with the paramagnetic metal phase possessing a pair of nonsymmorphic-symmetry-protected 2D spin-orbit Dirac points. Furthermore, the magnetism can be effectively controlled by the applied strain. When the magnetic ordering is turned into FM, the system can become a quantum anomalous Hall insulator with gapless chiral edge states.

Shorter aeration time and sludge retention time (10 days) were implemented to simultaneously eliminate AOB and NOB, the bio-activities drastically decreased to 13 and 0%, respectively. Subsequently, a gradually prolonged aeration time selectively enriched AOB and resulted in PN. The amoA abundances increased to 1.9 x 10(10) copies gVSS(-1), whereas Nitrospira and Nitrobacter abundances remained stable (3.2 x 10(9) and 3.1 x 10(9) copies gVSS(-1)). A nitrite accumulation rate above 96% was achieved and maintained for 205 days over the entire temperature range (28.5-17.9 degrees C).

Catalytic Hem was cross-linked onto MA scaffold for the mineralization of Au-Ag bimetals yielding the rod-like nanocomposite of MA-Hem/Au-Ag. It was discovered that the resulting nanocomposite could present high aqueous stability and especially improved catalysis, which was more than four-fold higher than that of native Hem. Catalytic kinetics studies indicate that the prepared nanocomposite nanozyme could present much higher affinities to the substrates than those of native Hem or even horseradish peroxidase. Herein, the so mineralized Au-Ag bimetals with the "silver effect" would act as "nanowires" for promoting the electron transferring of nanocomposite nanozyme. Moreover, the Hem-coupled MA polymer matrix with high specific surface area could ensure the high adsorption capacity for the reactant substrates and targeting analytes. The application feasibility of the developed nanocomposite nanozyme was demonstrated subsequently by the colorimetric assays for H2O2 and glucose separately in milk and blood samples, with the linear ranges of 0.010-2.50 mM and 0.0050-2.0 mM, respectively. Such a bimetal mineralization-based fabrication route may open a new door toward the design of diverse nanocomposites nanozymes with improved catalysis and adsorption performances.

Because of the unique architecture with ultrathin and porous nanosheets of the Co1.2Ni1.8O4 shell, this composite exhibits better electrochemical performance than the pristine Mn2O3. Remarkably, it shows excellent methanol tolerance, even in a high concentration solution. The DMFC was assembled with Mn2O3@Co1.2Ni1.8O4, polymer fiber membranes, and PtRu/C as the cathode, membrane, and anode, respectively. The power densities of 57.5 and 70.5 mW cm(-2) were recorded at 18 and 28 degrees C, respectively, especially the former is the best result reported in the literature at such a low temperature. The stability of the Mn2O3@Co1.2Ni1.8O4 catalyzed cathode was evaluated, and the results show that this compound possesses excellent stability in a high methanol concentration. The improved electrochemical activity could be attributed to the narrow band gap of the hybrid, which accelerates the electrons jumping from the valence band to the conduction band. Therefore, Mn-III could be oxidized into Mn-IV more easily, simultaneously providing an electron to the absorbed oxygen.

By analyzing the energy band structures, the total density of states and the partial densities of states, it is found that the band gaps for the perfect BiOF and BiO7/8F are 3.12 and 2.65 eV, respectively, which are smaller than the experiment value of 3.64 eV. There is a new electronic state within the forbidden band in the BiO7/8F, which could serve as a capture center for excited electrons, consequently improves the effective separation of electron-hole pairs, and makes the optical absorption band edge red shift. The calculated results demonstrate that the BiOF crystal and its oxygen vacancy BiO7/8F could be the potential application as photocatalytic semiconductor materials.

Initially monodispersed Au@SiO2-MPS (MPS: 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate) core-shell nanospheres were prepared by coating of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) via the modified Stober method. Narrowly dispersed Au@SiO2@ PVAn nanospheres were prepared by distillation-precipitation polymerization of 4-vinylaniline (VAn) and divinylbenzene (DVB) from the Au@SiO2-MPS-1 template nanospheres. Surface-initiated oxidative graft copolymerization of aniline from the Au@SiO2@ PVAn nanospheres, using the aniline moieties of PVAn as the anchoring site, produced the Au@SiO2@ PVAn-g-PANI nanospheres. HF etching of the hairy Au@SiO2@PVAn-g-PANI core-double shell nanospheres removes the inorganic silica inner-shell and gives rise to hairy Au@air@ PVAn-g-PANI hybrid nanorattles. The hybrid nanorattles can be integrated into an electrically insulating poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix. The Al/Au@air@PVAn-g-PANI + PVA/ITO-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flexible device, with a turn-on voltage of -2.0 V and an ON/OFF state current ratio of more than 104, was fabricated. This device can be switched to the ON state under a negative electrical sweep and also can be reset to the initial OFF state by a reverse (positive) electrical sweep. The memory behaviors of the flexible device were almost unchanged under the bending test.

Mass spectrometric characterization and thermostability of turkey myoglobin	LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Pink color defect; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; Myoglobin; Mass spectrometry; Thermostability	PINK COLOR DEFECT; AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; COVALENT STRUCTURE; HEART MYOGLOBIN; REDOX INSTABILITY; INDUCED OXIDATION; LIPID OXIDATION; SCOMBRIDAE FISH; CARBON-MONOXIDE; TUNA MYOGLOBIN	Pink color defect (PCD) is a major quality problem in the turkey industry leading to pink appearance of pre-cooked, uncured turkey. The present study determined the molecular mass of turkey myoglobin (Mb) using mass spectrometry and characterized the thermostability, of turkey Mb, in comparison with beef Mb, to elucidate the molecular basis of PCD. Purified turkey and beef myoglobins were analyzed using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. The thermostability of turkey and beef oxymyoglobins was examined at pH and Mb concentrations (pH 6.2 and 0.04 mmol/L for turkey; pH 5.6 and 0.15 mmol/L for beef) reflecting inherent conditions in these meats. Turkey and beef oxymyoglobins were incubated at 71, 75, and 80 degrees C and percentage myoglobin denaturation (PMD) was determined. Molecular mass of turkey Mb (17,295 Da) was 346 Da greater than beef Mb (16,949 Da) and was approximately 300-350 Da greater than those of other red meat myoglobins, suggesting its unique primary structure. PMD was lower (P < 0.05) in turkey Mb than in beef Mb during incubation at 71, 75 and 80 degrees C, indicating that in-situ turkey Mb is less susceptible to heat-induced denaturation than beef Mb at typical meat cooking conditions. The observed greater thermostability of turkey Mb compared to beef Mb could be, partially, due to inherent greater pH in turkey than in beef. Possible unique primary structure of turkey Mb could have contributed to its greater thermostability, which is one of the reasons for PCD. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, functional electrolytes that are compatible with both high-voltage cathodes and Li anodes are required for their developments. In this study, the use of a moderate-concentration LiPF6 and LiNO3 dual-salt electrolyte composed of ester and ether co-solvents (fluoroethylene carbonate/dimethoxyethane, FEC/DME), which forms a unique Li+ solvation with aggregated dual anions, that is, PF6- and NO3-, is proposed to stabilize high-voltage LMBs. Mechanistic studies reveal that such a solvation sheath improves the Li plating/stripping kinetics and induces the generation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer with gradient heterostructure and high Young's modulus on the anode, and a thin and robust cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film. Therefore, this novel electrolyte enables colossal Li deposits with a high Coulombic efficiency (approximate to 98.9%) for 450 cycles at 0.5 mA cm(-2).

This study investigated the influence of UA on the composting of food waste in an in-vessel system. RESULTS: Results showed that the performance of food waste composting was significantly different in systems with UA amendment and without UA amendment. Treatment with UA addition was the first to reach the thermophilic phase. More intensive mass reduction took place in the UA-amended treatments at an early stage. The variations of pH and O2 uptake were also correlated with the added UA. A decreasing trend in C/N ratio and a general increasing trend for NH4+-N concentration were observed when UA was added. CONCLUSIONS: The overall effect of UA can be assumed to be the sum of a large number of individual events with different mechanisms. Appropriate strategies could be applied to adjust the composting process, mediating both positive and negative effects of the coexistence of food waste and UA as well as manure. The results from this study may have important implications for composting technologies used to treat food waste.

A series of characterization analyses demonstrated the successful preparation of photocatalyst Bi2S3/BiOBr/BC. Furthermore, diclofenac (DCF) as the target contaminant was applied to elucidate the enhanced photocatalytic performance (93.65%, 40 min) under energy-saving visible LED light irradiation. Comparison experiments among different photocatalysts and photoelectrochemical tests results illustrated that excellent photocatalytic performance of Bi2S3/BiOBr/BC 10% might be attributed to the electrons transfer of biochar and higher charge separation efficiency of heterojunction structure. Besides, lower electrical energy per order value indicated photocatalyst/visible LED light system was more energy-saving. Proper photocatalyst dosage (0.6 g/L) and relatively acidic water environment (pH = 5.0) would be beneficial to DCF photodegrdation by Bi2S3/BiOBr/BC. Good reusability and stability of Bi2S3/BiOBr/BC were verified via five consecutive recycle experiments. Furthermore, the role of active species was determined through trapping experiments and O-center dot(2)- and h(+) dominated the photodegradation reaction to mineralize DCF molecules. Eleven main intermediates and four possible photodegradation pathways were proposed by HRMS analysis. Accordingly, photocatalyst Bi2S3/BiOBr/BC would provide potential technical support for emerging pollutant removal in water matrix.

Noble metal alloy nanoparticles (NPs) are of great interest due to their unique tunable structures and high activity. In this study, Au-Pd alloy NPs supported on hydrophilic mesoporous poly(ionic liquid) (MPIL) exhibited encouragingly high performance in the aerobic oxidation of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in water under mild conditions. Nearly complete conversion of HMF is attained at a low temperature of 90 degrees C under atmospheric O-2, resulting in 99% FDCA yield and high turnover number (TON) of up to 350. After reaction, the catalyst can be facilely recovered and reused with stable activity. Surface wettability plays a dominant role in the oxidation of HMF to FDCA, and synergistic alloy effect accounts for high activity. The results also show that MPILs are a promising support platform to achieve stable and efficient metal NPs through task-specific design of functional monomers.

We evaluated possible changes by comparing cultivated and uncultivated lands in 2019 with paired reference lands from the Second National Soil Survey of China. The results showed that the clay content and the silt content in cultivated land increased with cultivation years (p < 0.05), while the sand content decreased. A comparison of the clay plus silt content between 2019 and the late 1970s revealed the accumulation of fine particles in the center of oases and the removal of fine particles at their edges. Our results also demonstrate that sand content increased in the newly reclaimed land, the uncultivated land at the edge of the oases, and the sandy land. A comparison of 15 paired reference samples indicated that in most plots, clay content and silt content in croplands are higher than in adjacent uncultivated lands, although some plots showed a decreasing trend, implying that agricultural cultivation dose not always increase fine particles. We conclude that the initial difference in soil texture before reclamation and reclamation history jointly result in differences in soil texture between cultivated and adjacent uncultivated lands. During oasis expansion, the reclamation of the sandy land can reduce wind erosion, suggesting that appropriate agricultural reclamation and conservation measures can mitigate the adverse effects of changes in soil texture.

This feature is highly attractive for nonlinear photonics applications. Ultrafast pulse generation is successfully demonstrated in this article for both Ytterbiumand Erbium-doped fibre lasers using micro-fibre deposited nickel disulfide (NiS2) as a saturable absorber (SA). The fabricated SA device has a modulation depth of 23% at 1.06 mu m and 30.8% at 1.55 mu m. Stable dissipative soliton operation was achieved at 1064.5 nm with a pulse duration of 11.7 ps and another stable conventional soliton pulse train was also obtained at 1560.2 nm with a pulse duration of 524 fs. These results demonstrate that the microfibre-based NiS2 has a broadband nonlinear response and can function as an efficient SA, therefore it has significant potential for use in ultrafast laser pulse generation.

The yielded PEI-DHB nanoparticles could display the peroxidase-like catalysis activity, so as to act as the metal-free nanozyme in catalyzing the chromogenic reactions of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine and H2O2. More interestingly, the catalysis activity of the polymer nanozymes could be specifically inhibited by heparin oppositely charged. A facile visualized colorimetric method was thereby developed for sensing heparin through combining the specific catalysis and electrostatic attraction of PEI-DHB nanozyme. It was found that the developed colorimetric method can enable the detection of heparin in serum over the linear concentration range of 0.050-1.0 mu M, promising the wide applications for the detection of heparin in the clinical laboratory for the disease diagnostics and pharmacological monitoring. More importantly, such a green synthesis method may be tailored for fabricating various metal-free polymer nanozymes for the wide catalysis applications.

The asymmetrical LCFNb/SDC|YSZ|LSM/YSZ cells are prepared and evaluated electrochemically by using DC (cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic) and AC impedance techniques in 50% CO: 50% CO2 at the fuel electrode compartment. XRD results indicate LCFNb in the composite fuel electrode is stable in CO and CO2 at high temperature and the LCFNb/SDC membane fuel electrode prepared by infiltration method presents high performance towards CO2 reduction and CO oxidation. The polarization resistance under open circuit in a 50% CO: 50% CO2 gas composition at 800 degrees C is 0.97 Omega cm(2). However, both the CV and polarized impedance data show that the cell performance is higher for the electrolysis of CO2 than for the oxidation of CO. The polarization resistance in 50% CO: 50% CO2 at 1.4 V at 800 degrees C is 0.39 Omega cm(2). Notably, the cell shows a highly stable activity towards CO2 electrolysis at different applied voltages at the temperature of 800 degrees C. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This method could simultaneously degrade the H-acid adsorbed in the BCs-based BiFeO3 (BFO) nanocomposites (BFO/BCs), in which BFO was used as dopant intercalated into BC, and activate the used BCs. Because H-acid could be decomposed by OH, which was generated in a coexistent system, including MW irradiation, H2O2, and BCs. It's worth noticing the adsorption capacity was (236.8 mg g(-1)) 1.1-fold higher than that of unused BFO/BC (211.7 mg g(-1)). It indicated that the surplus % OH exhibited a cooperative effect with MW irradiation to restore H-acid-saturated BCs via the cleavage of C=C bond, thereby forming carboxylic groups and the pyrolysis effect. Findings indicated that the one-step degradation-regeneration method could effectively promote the adsorption capacity of H-acid-saturated BCs in a few minutes and could thus be considered a potential technology in water treatment.

This study investigated the toxicity of TiO2 nanosheets (NSs) to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), one of the pivotal cells involved in all stages of atherosclerosis. Only a high concentration of TiO2 NSs (128 mu g/mL) modestly induced cytotoxicity by decreasing thiols. RNA-sequencing data revealed that 64 mu g/mL TiO2 NSs significantly down-regulated 94 genes and up-regulated 174 genes, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways related to SMC function and lipid metabolism were altered. TiO2 NSs increased nuclear factor kappa B subunit 2 (NFKB2), which led to a decrease in VSMC marker actin alpha 2, smooth muscle (ACTA2). On the other hand, macrophage marker CD36 and fatty acid synthase (FASN) proteins were increased. Additionally, TiO2 NSs induced inflammatory cytokines and lipid accumulation, and these effects were curtailed by NFKB inhibitor - triptolide. Furthermore, repeated TiO2 NS injection (5 mg/kg BW, once a day for 5 continuous days) into ICR mice led to increased NFKB2, CD36 and FASN, with a decreased ACTA2. Our results suggested that TiO2 NSs promoted the transformation of VSMCs into foam cells through the up-regulation of NFKB2.

Traditional assembly approaches of 3D MXene aerogels normally involve external binders/templates and/or additional functionalization, which sacrifice the electrical conductivities and electrochemical activities of MXene aerogels. Herein, inspired by the hierarchal scale textures of Phrynosoma cornutum, a crumple-textured Ti3C2Tx MXene platform is engineered to facilitate Mg2+-induced assembly, enabling conformal formation of large-area Mg2+-MXene aerogels without polymeric binders. Through a doctor blading technique and freeze drying, the Mg2+-MXene aerogels are produced with customized shapes/dimensions, featuring high surface area (140.5 m(2) g(-1)), superior electrical conductivity (758.4 S m(-1)), and high robustness in water. The highly conductive MXene aerogels show their versatile applications from macroscale technologies (e.g., electromagnetic interference shielding and capacitive deionization (CDI)) to on-chip electronics (e.g., quasi-solid-state microsupercapacitors (QMSCs)). As CDI electrodes, the Mg2+-MXene aerogels exhibit high salt adsorption capacity (33.3 mg g(-1)) and long-term operation reliability (over 30 cycles), showing a superb comparison with the literature. Also, the QMSCs with interdigitated Mg2+-MXene aerogel electrodes demonstrate high areal capacitances (409.3 mF cm(-2)) with superior power density and energy density compared with other state-of-art QMSCs.

Here, we report a photoelectrochemical determination of mercury(II) ions with nickel oxyhydroxide-functionalized n-silicon photoanodes at zero working voltage. Based on the catalysis effect of Hg(II) ions on the photocurrent of the catechol probe, a simple and sensitive photoelectrochemical sensor was constructed for Hg(II) ions detection in purified drinking waters (PW1, PW2 and PW3). The photocurrents show good response after the solution containing Hg(II) ions was added to the photoelectrochemically active catechol solution. Under the optimized conditions, the increase of photocurrent is proportional to the Hg(II) ions concentration, the linear dynamic range is observed from 10 nM to 450 nM with the detection limits of 5.4, 7.2 and 5.2 nM in PW1, PW2 and PW3, respectively. Our work suggests that the two electrodes structures are promising for low-cost, portable, real-time, heavy metal ion detectors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, Au nanoneedles are inserted into the metalloporphyrin framework to activate C-C coupling and stabilize the structure for much enhanced ethylene production. Direct implementation of metal-organic frameworks as the catalyst for CO2 electroreduction has been challenging due to issues such as poor conductivity, stability, and limited > 2e(-) products. In this study, Au nanoneedles are impregnated into a cupric porphyrin-based metal-organic framework by exploiting ligand carboxylates as the Au3+ -reducing agent, simultaneously cleaving the ligand-node linkage. Surprisingly, despite the lack of a coherent structure, the Au-inserted framework affords a superb ethylene selectivity up to 52.5% in Faradaic efficiency, ranking among the best for metal-organic frameworks reported in the literature. Through operando X-ray, infrared spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations, the enhanced ethylene selectivity is attributed to Au-activated nitrogen motifs in coordination with the Cu centers for C-C coupling at the metalloporphyrin sites. Furthermore, the Au-inserted catalyst demonstrates both improved structural and catalytic stability, ascribed to the altered charge conduction path that bypasses the incoherent framework. This study underlines the modulation of reticular metalloporphyrin structure by metal impregnation for steering the CO2 reduction reaction pathway.

The objective of this study is to find a method for mitigating the biofouling of poly(ether sulfone) (PES) ultrafiltration membranes via blending of thermoexfoliated vermiculite (VMT). Flow cytometry analysis shows that the behaviors of Bacillus subtilis 168 as a Gram-positive bacterium and Escherichia coli DH5 alpha as a Gram-negative bacterium were different. Hence, cell property is a suspected contributory factor in biofilm. formation. Accordingly, considering the local predominant bacterial strains, a regionally customized membrane could scientifically be an expert solution for biofouling mitigation. Fabricated composite membranes have shown a higher flux compared to control PES membrane. Among all composite membranes, the PES-VMT0.10 had the highest flux of 476.4 L/(m(2) h) (LMH) before fouling, and the highest flux of 210.7' LMH after three cycles of usage. In addition, the rejection rate of the PES-VMT0.15 The bovine serum albumin (BSA) sample was >77%, while that of the PES-VMT0.10 was >84%. The results of the static BSA adsorption test and the bacterial attachment test indicated that the membranes with macro-roughness on "their surface showed 'better antibiofonling resistance. The antifouling properties of the modified membranes were also improved, because of their optimal wettability. On one hand, the hydrophilicity of membranes caused damaging both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and bacteriocidal effect. On the other hand, BSA adsorption and bacterial attachment on the membrane surface were affected by pore diameter.

Herein, we reported a facile method to construct a series of germanate-based anionic COFs (Ge-COFs) by reticulating dianionic hexa-coordinated GeO6 nodes with anthracene building blocks adopting a hcb topology in an extended 2D framework. A systematic change of pore properties in Ge-COFs was observed through the incorporation of three different alkali metal cations: Li+, Na+, and K+. The intrinsically negatively charged backbone provides a host matrix with a homogeneous distribution of counter cations and poses variable and exciting features for gas adsorption and ionic conduction. Among the series, K+-based Ge-COF-K with a surface area of 1252 m(2)/g and pore volume of 0.84 cm(3)/g shows a maximum CO2 uptake of 126 cm(3)/g (247.4 mg/g) at 273 K and 1 bar, an IAST selectivity of 140 over N-2. Ge-COF-K also exhibits a high SO2 kinetic breakthrough capacity of 154 mg/g at low ppm of SO2 concentration under ambient conditions among recently reported porous materials. Moreover, reasonably high lithium, sodium, and potassium ionic conductivities were observed with the values of 1.2 x 10(-4), 3.4 x 10(-5), and 2.2 x 10(-5) S/cm for propylene carbonate infiltrated Ge-COF-Li, Ge-COF-Na, and Ge-COF-K at 100 degrees C, respectively.

Surface conductance (G(s)), a key variable reflecting crop physiological and soil physical responses to changing environment, often is a significant impediment to the practical application of the P-M equation. Here, we derived a dynamic biophysical model of G(s) after incorporating the combined contributions of crop canopy and soil based on: (a) dynamic fraction of canopy cover; (b) response of stomata to radiation intercepted by crop canopy, vapor pressure deficit, and soil water availability in the root zone; and (c) soil evaporation coefficient affected by radiation reaching soil surface and soil moisture. The dynamic G(s) model with the P-M equation can predict the variation of G(s) and ET from partial to full canopy cover as crop growing. The model was parameterized by measurements using the eddy covariance technique over an irrigated maize field in 2009, and validated using independent data in 2010. We found good data-model agreements between ET predicted by the dynamic G(s) model with P-M equation and measurements for both half-hourly and daily time-scales from partial to full canopy cover. The model also produced satisfactory estimation for soil evaporation. Therefore, the model is an alternative approach to predict ET using P-M equation for partial to full crop canopy cover.

We used CEA as template, dopamine (DA) as imprinted monomers. Through controlling electropolymerization, a "PDA-CEA" complex was achieved. After elution, the specific cavities adsorbed the target molecules. In addition, polythionine (PTh) and AuNPs were applied as the electrode modifying materials to enhance electron transfer rate and improve detection signal. Using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) detection, the peak current decreased with the increase in concentration of CEA, and the linear response range of the MIP sensor was from 0.001 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL with the detection limit as low as 0.2589 pg/mL. The MIP sensor had a low sample consumption, good stability, and high sensitivity, and could become a new promising method for the detection of CEA. Furthermore, this MIP sensor was demonstrated in testing CEA in human serum sample with satisfactory results.

After optimizing the addition concentration and time of H2O2, a maximum concentration of 33.9g/L -PGA was obtained by adding 100 mu M H2O2 to the medium after 24H. This concentration was 20.6% higher than that of the control. The addition of diphenyleneiodonium chloride (ROS inhibitor) can interdict the effect of H2O2-induced ROS. Transcriptional levels of the cofactors and relevant genes were also determined under ROS stress to illustrate the possible metabolic mechanism contributing to the improve -PGA production. The transcriptional levels of genes belonging to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transfer chain system were significantly increased by ROS, which decreased the NADH/NAD(+) ratio and increased the ATP levels, thereby providing more reducing power and energy for -PGA biosynthesis. The enhanced -PGA synthetic genes also directly promoted the formation of -PGA. This study was the first to use the ROS control strategy for -PGA fermentation and provided valuable information on the possible mechanism by which ROS regulated -PGA biosynthesis in B. subtilis NX-2.

Herein, oil-in-water Pickering emulsion gel technology was combined with the hot pressing process to prepare cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) reinforced PMMA/PS binary blend composite film materials (CNFs/PMMA/PS). The CNFs/PMMA/PS composites with a pebble-shaped structure had a unique three-dimensional crosslinked network structure and endowed the composite film with better thermal stability, and excellent transparency and mechanical properties. Particularly, the derivative thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry results revealed that the compatibility between the PMMA and the PS phases in the composite film is remarkably improved. The optimal tensile strength (58 MPa) and maximum strain (4.2%) were obtained when the content of CNFs was 52%, which represented approximately 3-fold and 2-fold improvements, respectively, than those of the PMMA/PS blend films. Moreover, the C-CNFs/PMMA/PS composite films maintained an excellent light transmittance of approximately 80% in the wavelength range of 600 to 800 nm. The facile preparation method is proposed to achieve an excellent dispersion of unmodified CNFs in hydrophobic and binary polymer mixture, which constitutes a new approach for using CNFs to enhance the high performance of polymer materials.

To this end, high-efficiency separation membranes have been developed to mitigate emerging challenges. Bisphenol A ethoxylate diacrylate (BPA) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) were UV-cross-linked in the presence of low molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME) to prepare high-performance CO2 capture membranes in a green way. During the entire membrane fabrication process, no additional solvent was involved and no waste of membrane materials occurred, resulting in a green process. The such-prepared membrane presents an outstanding CO2 permeability of 4883 Barrer, a new record for poly(ethylene oxide) membranes, with a high CO2/N-2 ideal selectivity of 43 due to the cooperative contribution of BPA and PEGDME. The unprecedented separation performance of our manufactured membrane is even higher than that of the 2019 CO2/N-2 upper bound. Considering the rapid, cost-effective, and green fabrication process, our membrane potentially offers a dramatic advantage in alleviating the current greenhouse gas issue and shows great promise for practical applications.

Response surface methodology was applied to find out the major parameters influencing 2,4-D removal efficiency. Moreover, the optimal values of these parameters and the interactions between them were investigated (pH, MIEX dose and reaction time). The experimental data of variables showed a high correlation with the second-order polynomial model, with a coefficient of determination value (R-2) of 0.9945 in terms of 2,4-D. Multiple response optimization was also employed to the experimental data to discover the optimal conditions for a set of response, simultaneously, by using a desirability function. The optimum pH, adsorbent dose and reaction time were found to be 6.06, 1.0 mL/L and 52.33 min, respectively. The highest removal of 2,4-D (97.02%) was reached under these conditions. After the process optimization, the MIEX treatment was proven to be a good option for the removal of 2,4-D. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, MXenes have only been used as negative electrodes as they are easily oxidized at positive (anodic) potential. To construct a high-performance MXene-based asymmetric device, a positive electrode with a compatible performance is highly desired. Herein, an ultrafast polyaniline@MXene cathode prepared by casting a homogenous polyaniline layer onto a 3D porous Ti3C2Tx MXene is reported, which enables the stable operation of MXene at positive potentials because of the enlarged work function after compositing with polyaniline, according to the first-principle calculations. The resulting flexible polyaniline@MXene positive electrode demonstrates a high volumetric capacitance of 1632 F cm(-3) and an ultrahigh rate capability with 827 F cm(-3) at 5000 mV s(-1), surpassing all reported positive electrodes. An asymmetric device is further fabricated with MXene as the anode and polyaniline@MXene as the cathode, which delivers a high energy density of 50.6 Wh L-1 and an ultrahigh power density of 127 kW L-1.

The structure, crystallinity and surface functionality of as-prepared nanocomplexes were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The effects of various parameters such as pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, ionic strength, and temperature on MB adsorption were investigated. Results showed that the adsorption of MB on iron-TA was found to be dependent on pH and temperature, while increasing ionic strength decreased the adsorption of MB on iron-TA. Adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 4 h and the adsorption kinetics of MB was found to follow a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Equilibrium data for MB adsorption were fitted well by Sips isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity for MB was estimated to be 67.41 mg/g at 313 K. Furthermore, thermodynamic parameters exhibited the feasibility, spontaneity and endothermic nature of the adsorption process. FTIR study revealed that the hydroxyl groups of iron-TA might be involved into electrostatic interaction with MB. The results suggested that the iron-TA would be an excellent alternative for the removal of MB by adsorption process.	[Li, Y. M.; Miao, X.; Wei, Z. G.; Cui, J.; Li, S. Y.; Han, R.

We presented a general protocol to improve the hydrodynamic permeability and blood compatibility of PES UF membranes by a simple biomimetic strategy. The chemical structure and surface morphology of the PDA coated membranes were studied in detail; meanwhile, the influence of the coated PDA nano-layer on water contact angle and water flux of the modified membranes was investigated. It was found that the water flux of the pure PES membrane decreased dramatically, approach to 0 ml/(m(2) h mmHg), after a few hours of PDA coating. To avoid the dramatic decline of water flux, the method of pre-adding pore-forming reagent was taken to fabricate the PDA coated PES membranes with tunable water flux. Moreover, the anti-fouling property, platelet adhesion, and blood coagulation time of the PDA modified PES membranes were studied, and the results indicated that the PDA modified PES UF membranes showed enhanced blood compatibility.

X-ray diffractometry (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectrometer, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carefully used to investigate the morphologies, structures and chemical compositions of these samples. Their sensing properties toward ethanol gas were studied. Compared with pure In2O3 NTs (response value is 17), pure In2O3 PNTs (response value is 20) demonstrated enhanced sensing characteristics. What's more, the response of Ho-doped In2O3 PNTs sensors to 100 ppm ethanol was up to 60 at 240 A degrees C, which increased three times more than that of the pure In2O3 PNTs. Additionally, the minimum concentration for ethanol was 200 ppb (response value is 2). The increased gas-sensing ability was attributed not only to the hollow and porous structure, but to the Ho dopant. Furthermore, Ho-doped In2O3 PNTs enable sensor to discriminate between ethanol and the other gas distinctly, particularly acetone that is usually indistinguishable from ethanol. Also, by analyzing XRD, TGA and Raman spectrometer, a possible formation mechanism of porous nanotubes and sensing mechanism were put forward.

However, it is unclear if BC is able to directly stimulate the microbial reduction of N2O to N-2. We hypothesized that the ability of BC to lower N2O emissions could be related not only to its ability to store electrons, but to donate them to bacteria that enzymatically reduce N2O. Therefore, we carried out anoxic incubations with Paracoccus denitrificans, known amounts of N2O, and nine contrasting BCs, in the absence of any other electron donor or acceptor. We found a strong and direct correlation between the extent and rates of N2O reduction with BC's EDC/EEC (electron donating capacity/electron exchange capacity). Apart from the redox capacity, other BC properties were found to regulate the BC's ability to increase N2O reduction by P. denitrificans. For this specific BC series, we found that a high H/C and ash content, low surface area and poor lignin feedstocks favored N2O reduction. This provides valuable information for producing tailored BCs with the potential to assist and promote the reduction of N2O in the pursuit of reducing this greenhouse gas emissions.

A better appreciation of their ecological preferences and the controls on the composition and distribution of fungal communities at macroecological scales is needed. Here, we used one of the most extensive continental-scale datasets on soil fungi and modelled the relative abundance of dominant fungal phyla and community diversity in Australian soils from forests, grasslands, shrublands, woodlands, and croplands. Across these diverse ecosystems, the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota dominate Australian soils, and fungal diversity declines as climates become more arid. Climate and the water balance exert dominant control on soil fungal abundance and diversity, mediated by interactions between ecosystem type, the ensuing vegetation and edaphic factors, such as organic matter, clay and iron-oxide mineralogy, pH and nutrients. Soil organic matter and mineralogy, represented by absorptions of visible-near-infrared (vis-NIR) radiation, helped to improve characterisation of the abiotic controls on soil fungi. This better representation of edaphic factors improved the predictability of the models by up to 40%. Our findings contribute to the understanding of fungal ecology at a macroecological scale. They help to appreciate better the links between fungi, soil and the environment, which underpin ecosystem stability and resilience and have implications for developing strategies for preservation, adaptation and mitigation of global change.

In order to enhance the material properties, nano-SiO2, sodium silicate and styrene-acrylic emulsion are selected to optimize the pore structure and strength of the material. The results show that pores in the unmodified cement-based sealing material are mostly mesoporous, accounting for 95.44%, microporous is 4.56%. Synergistic effect of sodium silicate and SiO2 increased the proportion of microporous to 10.62%, but the total porosity is higher than that of ordinary sealing materials. SiO2 and styrene-acrylic emulsion greatly reduce the pore volume of the material. The pore volume decreases from 0.09418 cc/g to 0.05621 cc/g, and the microporous increases to 16.67%. The fractal dimensions D-1 and D-2 decreased by 2.73% and 3.84%, indicating that the pore surface roughness increased and the pore structure became more complicated. This paper is of great significance for improving the efficiency of gas mining. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, density functional theory (DFT) is applied to study the reduction mechanism of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH3OH) on the Cu(1 1 1), Sn@Cu(1 1 1) and Sn(2 1 1) catalysts. The adsorption structures of all possible intermediates are determined. It is found that for the HCOOH pathway, the rate-limiting step form the reduction of CO2 to form HCOO on the Cu(1 1 1) and Sn@Cu(1 1 1) surface is transformed to the reduction of HCOO forming HCOOH on the Sn(2 1 1) surface. The activity of three catalyst models towards HCOOH production follows: Sn@Cu(1 1 1) > Sn(2 1 1) > Cu(1 1 1). For the CH3OH pathway, the potential rate-limiting step on the Cu(1 1 1), Sn@Cu(1 1 1) and Sn(2 1 1) surfaces is the formation of COOH via CO2. The activity of three catalyst models towards CH3OH production follows: Sn@Cu(1 1 1) > Cu(1 1 1) > Sn(2 1 1). The results demonstrate that the doping of Sn onto Cu surface may be a potential strategy for the development of efficient CO2 electrocatalyst.

The probe has a fluorescence (with excitation/ emission peaks at 267/380 nm) that is quenched by DA with high selectivity over various interferences. This is attributed to a reaction that occurs between DA and the molybdate ions in pH 9 solutions of MoS2 QDs. The formation of organic molybdate complexes and of dopamine-quinone results in strong quenching of the fluorescence of the QDs which is due to both electron transfer and an inner filter effect. Under the optimum conditions, the assay works in the 0.1-100 mu M DA concentration range, with two linear ranges and a 10 nM detection limit. The method was applied to the determination of DA in spiked artificial urine samples, where it gave recoveries ranging from 97.6 to 102.2%, demonstrating that the method a promising tool for rapid and selective detection of DA.

Eupatorium adenophorum, which is a malignant invasive plant, was used to synthesise biochar and a novel lanthanum-based biochar composite (LaC). The biochar and LaC were used as cheap and environmentally benign PRB filling materials to remediate simulated and real Cd-contaminated soils. The pH and residual Cd concentration in the simulated contaminated soil during remediation gradually increased from the anode to the cathode used to apply an electric field to the EK-PRB system. However, the soil conductivity changed in the opposite way, and the current density first increased and then decreased. For simulated contaminated soils with initial Cd concentrations of 34.9 and 100.6 mg kg(-1), the mean Cd removal rates achieved using LaC were 90.6% and 89.3%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of biochar (P < 0.05). Similar results were achieved using natural soils from mining area and polluted farmland, and the Cd removal rates were 66.9% and 72.0%, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that there were many functional groups on the LaC surfaces. The removal mechanism of EK-PRB for Cd in contaminated soil includes electromigration, electroosmotic flow, surface adsorption, and ion exchange. The results indicated that the LaC could be used in the EK-PRB technique as a cheap and 'green' material to efficiently decontaminate soil polluted with heavy metals.

In order to enhance the HER activity, tremendous effort has been made to engineer MoS2 catalysts with either more active sites or higher conductivity. However, at present, synergistically structural and electronic modulations for HER still remain challenging. In this work, we demonstrate the successfully synergistic regulations of both structural and electronic benefits by controllable disorder engineering and simultaneous oxygen incorporation in MoS2 catalysts, leading to the dramatically enhanced HER activity. The disordered structure can offer abundant unsaturated sulfur atoms as active sites for HER, while the oxygen incorporation can effectively regulate the electronic structure and further improve the intrinsic conductivity. By means of controllable disorder engineering and oxygen incorporation, an optimized catalyst with a moderate degree of disorder was developed, exhibiting superior activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In general, the optimized catalyst exhibits onset overpotential as low as 120 mV, accompanied by extremely large cathodic current density and excellent stability. This work will pave a new pathway for improving the electrocatalytic activity by synergistically structural and electronic modulations.

However, the low photoinduced electron transfer efficiency and insufficient separation of electron-hole pairs would severely preclude their widespread practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate an interesting plasmonic photocatalyst based on the construction of icosahedral (Ih) Au@C-60 core-shell NMs, taking advantage of specific delocalized Tr electrons structure of a tight C-60 shell and enhanced LSPR property of Ih Au core. Then, the pronounced interfacial interaction at junction region endows the obtained Au@C-60 NMs with an outstanding photoinduced hot carrier-transmission during photocatalytic reaction, facilitating a remarkably higher (1.89 times) photocatalytic activity toward visible-light driven degradation of crystal violet (CV) dyes, as compared to bare Au NMs. Impressively, the photocatalytic activity of Ih Au@C-60 NMs can be effectively optimized by changing the pH value of reaction solution, with the kinetic rate constant reaching the maximum value of 0.179 min(-1) in pH(0) 11.4 solution, while 0.005 min(-1) at pH(0) 3.0. Moreover, due to the protection of a tight C-60 shell, the Ih Au@C-60 NMs also possess excellent photocatalytic stability/reusability in recycling runs, holding great potential for the design of robust and high-performance plasmonic photocatalysts in repeated practical applications.

In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of melatonin on the autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammatory reaction of macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) stimulated by nanosilica. SiO2 (100 mg/mL, 10-20 nm) was used to stimulate RAW264.7 cells at different time points (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hr). Melatonin (200 mu M) was added to SiO2-stimulated macrophages at 12 hr. Beclin-1, LC3, Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3 were examined with western blotting. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis. The levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 were detected by ELISA. The level of TNF-alpha in the supernatant of SiO2-stimulated cells gradually increased with time but decreased following melatonin administration. In contrast, the expression of IL-1 beta and IL-18 increased after melatonin treatment. LC3 and Bax signaling pathways were activated in SiO2-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, showing elevated expression of LC3 and reduced expression of Bax in the melatonin-treated cells. GFP-LC3 puncta were significantly increased in SiO2-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and decreased in melatonin-treated cells. The apoptotic rate in SiO2-stimulated RAW264.7 cells increased with time and decreased after melatonin treatment, and the number of phagosomes increased with the stimulation of nanosilica and the treatment of melatonin. Melatonin might promote autophagy and inhibit apoptosis as well as inflammatory responses of RAW264.7 cells stimulated by nanosilica.

The effects of GFs content on the mechanical properties of composites were investigated, discussing the results from flexural, tensile, and impact tests. The composites revealed noticeable improvement in flexural strength, tensile strength as well as impact strength but slow decrease in elongation at break, compared to the epoxy/ATHBP thermoset. FESEM morphology results indicated the good compatibility between epoxy matrix and GF in the appearance of ATHBP and showed that the toughening mechanism was mainly attributed to the stress transfer mechanism.

Although the concept of the photocathodic protection of steels has been proposed for about two decades, this technique is still far away from practical applications due to the limited protection capability. In this work, we reported that the BiVO4 photoanode significantly decreases the self-corrosion potential of 316 steel by 166 mV, and the decoration of NiFeOx films onto BiVO4 further shifts the self-corrosion potential by similar to 90 mV negatively, which exhibits an excellent protection capability. The protection capability of the photoelectrode to steel is limited by the relative position of the Fermi level of the semiconducting material, and confined by the thermodynamics of the surface reactions on the semiconductor-electrolyte interface.

The mechanistic studies, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and environmental diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis, revealed that the incorporation of Ag in AgPd NPs can effectively weaken CO adsorption on all possible Pd surface sites (the ligand effects), and more importantly, disrupt the strongest multi-centered CO-binding sites (the ensemble effects). With properly tuned CO adsorption, which is ordinarily too strong over pure Pd, Ag(15)Pd(85)NPs were found to be the best composition for the efficient production of CO. They deliver a unity conversion of CO(2)to CO with a high mass activity of 15.2 mA mg(metal)(-1)at -0.8 Vvs.the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and high stability with minimal change in the CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) after 12 hours of operation.

We then take LaCoO3 (100 and 110), LaCoO3 (111), and La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 (111) as comparison models, and we characterize their crystal structure, morphology, composition, electronic state, and catalytic properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the prepared samples with high-energy (111) crystal facets contain more surface oxygen species and active Co ions than La enrichment perovskite LaCoO3 (110 and 100) on the surface. Furthermore, combining with ambient-pressure XAS, valence band spectroscopy, and density functional calculations, we find that exposed high-energy (111) crystal facets and doping Sr ions can enhance the hybridization between Co cations and O anions and their O p-band center is closer to the Fermi level, compared with that of LaCoO3 (100 and 110). As expected, the samples with high-energy (111) crystal facets show better CO oxidation activity than LaCoO3 (100 and 110), and La0.2Sr0.3CoO3 (111) exhibits the highest catalytic activity. Our findings provide a new avenue to prepare high-energy facet perovskite catalysts and we also clearly reveal the relationship between surface electronic structure and intrinsic CO oxidation activity of perovskite cobaltite.

Electromagnetic wave absorption and dielectric-modulation of metallic perovskite lanthanum nickel oxide	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							MICROWAVE-ABSORPTION; COMPLEX PERMITTIVITY; CARBON NANOTUBES; OXYGEN-VACANCY; THIN-FILMS; LANIO3-DELTA; BEHAVIOR; CONDUCTIVITY; TRANSPORT; MICROSTRUCTURE	Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption properties of metallic perovskite lanthanum nickel oxide (LNO) powder and dielectric-modulated LNO-FeCo/C composites were investigated. Reflection loss (RL) of the LNO-paraffin composites depends on the mass ratio of LNO powder dispersion in the paraffin matrix, in which the optimal RL of -24.7 dB at 17.6 GHz with the absorbent layer thickness of 1.6 mm is obtained at the 10 wt% LNO-paraffin composite, just below the percolation threshold (PC) of the LNO dispersion in the paraffin matrix. Three absorption peaks in the frequency dependence of RL of the 10 wt% LNO-paraffin composite are ascribed to the dielectric relaxations which occurred at frequencies of about 3.3, 9.2 and 15.1 GHz. Dielectric-modulation by metal-conductive LNO powder significantly increases the relative complex permittivity of the (x) LNO-(y) FeCo/C-paraffin composites and a good impedance match coming from the dielectric-modulation by the LNO powder would be obtained just below the PC of the LNO powder dispersion in the paraffin matrix. The (8 wt%) LNO-(32 wt%) FeCo/C-paraffin composite exhibited an enhanced EM wave absorption performance, in which RL values less than -20 dB can be obtained in the 2-18 GHz range by choosing an appropriate thickness from 1.3 mm to 8 mm and the minimum RL is 50.6 dB at 9 GHz with the absorbent layer thickness of 2.4 mm.

For realizing the continuously pre-harvesting cultivation mode, a Spirulina platensis culture column PBR with overflowing device was designed, which could adjust pre-harvesting rate through the overflowing device. By adjusting the preharvesting rate, the biomass concentration could be kept when biomass accumulation and pre-harvesting biomass were equal. Hence, the meridional light attenuation could be reduced by controlling biomass concentration in PBR. The maximum microalgae production were 44.6%, 10.98% higher in total production than that cultivated in batch cultivation without pre-harvesting and periodically pre-harvesting cultivation mode respectively, which was realized in pre-harvesting rate 0.228 mL min(-1) and biomass concentration 1.8 g L-1. Besides, a model was built by mass balance and polynomial fitting for evaluating the continuously pre-harvesting cultivation mode.

In this study, we demonstrate a rapid microwave-assisted hydrothermal route for the assembly of 2D copper-porphyrin Metal-Organic Frameworks (Cu-TCPP MOFs) within 1 h. The resulting 2D Cu-TCPP nanosheets with excellent crystallinity and a large surface area (342.72 m(2)/g) exhibited outstanding adsorption performance for typical dyes with adsorption capacities of about 185 mg/g for rhodamine B, 625 mg/g for methylene blue, and 290 mg/g for Congo red, respectively, as well as for representative antibiotics with adsorption capacities of about 130 mg/g for oxytocin, 150 mg/g for tetracycline, and 50 mg/g for norfloxacin, respectively. Meanwhile, the as-prepared 2D Cu-TCPP showed good photocatalytic degradation activity of pollutants after adsorption under irradiation by visible light, reaching removal efficiencies of 81.2 and 86.3% toward rhodamine B and norfloxacin, respectively. These results demonstrate the promising potential of 2D Cu-TCPP for use in the removal of contaminants from wastewater.

It was discovered that Fe3O4 NPs could present the dramatically enhanced catalysis once anchored with ATP-specific aptamers (Apts), which is about 6-fold larger than that of bare Fe3O4 NPs. In the presence of ATP, however, the Apts would be desorbed from Fe3O4 NPs due to the Apts-target binding event, leading to the decrease of catalysis rationally depending on ATP concentrations. A colorimetric strategy was thereby developed to facilitate the highly selective detection of ATP, showing the linear concentrations ranging from 0.50 to 100 mu M. Subsequently, the developed ATP sensor was employed for the evaluation of ATP in blood with the analysis performances comparably better than those of the documented detection methods, showing the potential applications in the clinical laboratory for the detective diagnosis of some ATP-indicative diseases. Importantly, such a catalysis-based detection strategy should be extended to other kinds of nanozymes with intrinsic catalysis properties (i.e., peroxidase and oxidase-like activities), promising as a universal candidate for monitoring various biological species simply by using target-specific recognition elements like Apts and antibodies.

The composite film was fabricated by alternately depositing PdNPs and P2W17Fe on quartz and ITO substrates using the layer-by-layer method (LBL). The composite film was characterized by UV-visible spectrum. X-ray photoelectron spectrum and atomic force microscope. Cyclic voltammetry and amperometry were employed to explore the composite film's electrochemical properties and performance in sensing and detection. The results indicated that the composite film has good electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and oxidation of hydrazine sulfate, and is capable of sensing H2O2 and N2H4SO4 at suitable potential. The detection limit, sensitivity and linear concentration range are 1 mu M (S/N = 3), 66.7 mu A mM(-1), 1.5 mu M to 3.9 mM for hydrogen peroxide and 1.5 mu M (S/N = 3), 0.24 mu A mM(-1), 2 mu M to 3.4 mM for hydrazine sulfate, respectively. The small Michaelis-Menten constant K-M of PdNPs-containing film compared to PdNPs-free film indicated that introduction of PdNPs enhanced effectively the electrocatalytic ability of the composite film.

Low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) are important factors that regulate the degradation of PAHs by plant rhizosphere microorganisms, which affect the absorption of PAHs by plant roots. However, the comprehensive mechanisms by which LMWOAs influence the biodegradation of PAHs at cellular and omics levels are still unknown. Here, we systematically analyzed the roles of citric, glutaric and oxalic acid in the PAH-degradation process, and investigated the mechanisms through which these three LMWOAs enhance phenanthrene (PHE) biodegradation by B. subtilis ZL09-26. The results showed that LMWOAs can improve the solubility and biodegradation of PHE, enhance cell growth and activity, and relieve membrane and oxidative stress. Citric acid enhanced PHE biodegradation mainly by improving the strain's cell proliferation and activity, while glutaric and oxalic acid accelerated PHE biodegradation mainly by improving the expression of enzymes and providing energy for the cells of B. subtilis ZL09-26. This study provides new insights into rhizospheric bioremediation mechanisms, which may enable the development of new biostimulation techniques to improve the bioremediation of PAHs.

Simplification of heat treatment process in a tool steel by aluminium addition	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Steel; Phase transformation; Pearlite; Microstructure control; Mechanical properties; Aluminium	MEDIUM-CARBON STEEL; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; IMPACT TOUGHNESS; MICROSTRUCTURE; PEARLITE; TRANSFORMATION; AL; SPHEROIDIZATION; ACCELERATION; VANADIUM	A novel concept for simplification of heat treatment process in a tool steel by the addition of aluminium has been proposed in this research. The addition of 1.08 wt-% aluminium leads to an approximately fully pearlitic state, of which the cementite lamellae are largely spheroidised. Excessive addition of 1.58 wt-% aluminium would result in the formation of a large amount of delta-ferrite. These results are mainly attributed to the synthetic effect of aluminium on the driving force of pearlite transformation and the inter-spacing distance between the proeutectoid carbides. The mechanical properties' analyses show that aluminium has promising potential to substantially simplify the processing method for developing a relative low-cost mould steel without the concomitant mechanical properties' reductions.

Effects of phase transition temperature and preheating on residual stress in multi-pass & multi-layer laser metal deposition	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Residual stress; Phase transition temperature; Preheating; Laser metal deposition; Finite element analysis	TRANSFORMATION-INDUCED PLASTICITY; MATERIALS LTT; CARBON-STEEL; WELD; MICROSTRUCTURE; PREDICTION; FILLER; CONFIRMATION; DISTORTION; REDUCTION	To investigate the influences of phase transition temperature and preheating on the residual stress of multi-layer and multi-pass laser metal deposition (LMD), the multi-layer and multi-pass LMD, with and without preheating, were performed using five kinds of alloy with different phase transition features, and their residual stresses were measured using the hole drilling method. A finite-element (FE) model incorporating the phase transition was developed based on experimentally obtained physical property data. The results demonstrated that the low-temperature solid phase transition has a tensile stress relaxation effect, which leads to the formation of a compressive stress area. This relaxation effect was observed to decrease with the increase of the phase transition temperature. The high-temperature solid phase transition has no significant tensile stress relaxation effect during the multi-layer and multi-pass LMD process, which is different from the single track LMD. when the solid phase transition temperature is low, the preheating can improve the uniformity of the stress field only to a certain extent. However, when the preheating increases the lowest temperature of the thermal cycle and makes it higher than the starting point temperature of the solid phase transition, the tensile stress relaxation effect of the solid phase transition can be brought into full play.

However, studies on dust emission have mainly concentrated on arid and semiarid regions with few studies focused on dust emission in alpine areas, where having lower air temperatures and lower air pressure environments. The lower air temperature and lower air pressure could significantly impact the air density and make the entrainment and transport of dust different from those at lower altitudes. The lack of accurate studies on dust emission in alpine regions has resulted in large uncertainties in the global dust budget and brought large challenges in controlling aeolian hazards in alpine regions. To bridge this gap, we took the air density as an important parameter to simulate dust emission in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), where has typical low air-temperature and low air-pressure environments. The measured data showed that the lower air temperature and low air pressure affect the particle size distributions (PSDs) of aeolian sediment, the threshold velocity (TFV) as well as the dust emission rate. Herein, we introduced air density as an important factor to improve a dust emission model, and the validated results showed that the deviations of the simulated horizontal sand flux and vertical dust flux were less than 30% and 35%, respectively. Using the improved model, we could exactly depict the spatial and temporal distribution of dust emission in the QTP. The results shown, our model could exactly depict the spatial and temporal distribution of dust emission in the QTP. We believe that the improvement of the model could offer a new perspective on dust emission in environments with lower air temperature and lower air pressure, and the simulated results could provide valuable data for global dust budget estimation.

Test results showed that the Cu-Fe nanocomposites/modified diatomite adsorbent (Cu-Fe/MKL) was determined to be the most promising adsorbent for simultaneous removal of H2S and PH3. The removal efficiency of H2S and PH3 may have a strong connection to the variety and amounts of functional groups and active components available as well as calcination temperatures. When the copper and iron loading amounts were 10 wt% and 6 wt% at 450 degrees C, the Cu-Fe/MKL adsorbent achieved the best removal efficiency and had the largest breakthrough adsorption capacity. It kept an impressive efficiency (100%) for 150 min and 60 min for H2S and PH3, respectively, at a relatively low reaction temperature of 80 degrees C and a GHSV of 10,000 h(-1). The adsorbents were also characterized by different methods, such as FT-IR, BET, TGA, XRD, SEM, XPS and in-situ IR. FT-IR results showed that the adsorbents modification by hydrochloric acid can provide more O-H, C-O and C=C groups, which may generate more unsaturated sites to promote the removal performance for H2S and PH3. BET results indicated that the addition of Cu-Fe composites did not change the structure of diatomite and it was optimized for simultaneous adsorption/oxidation of H2S and PH3 when the pore size distribution was approximately 7-10 nm. Moreover, XRD and TGA results revealed that metal oxides were detected after calcination, and the main active components available should be Cu-Fe nanocomposites. Furthermore, SEM images showed that iron species may play an important role to promote the dispersion of active components. In addition, in-situ IR and XPS analysis indicated that the exhaustion of sample may be determined by the loss of active components and the accumulations of products. It was considered that the excellent performance of adsorbents may be determined by the synergism of function groups, active components and dispersion capacity of them. However, because the components of diatomite were complex, the mechanism was difficult to investigate in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Subsequently, the electromagnetic wave absorption properties of hierarchical MoS2 nanospheres compounded with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were investigated in a broad frequency range of 2-40 GHz. The results indicated that the MoS2/PVDF nanocomposites possess adjustable and enhanced wave absorption performance. Furthermore, the MA performance can be effectively, tuned by, he absorber's thickness and filler content. In addition, the peculiar hierarchical nanostructure of MoS2 is beneficial :to microwave absorption property compared with the bulk MoS2 and micrometer-sized MoS2. Moreover, the main microwave absorption mechanism including various polarization, destructive interference theory, and multiple reflection has been described in detail.

Due to its high specific surface area, abundant pores, interconnected structure, as well as a great length/diameter ratio, the as-prepared beta-MnO2, in 0.5 M Na2SO4, exhibits a good electrochemical performance at a wide temperature range of 5-80 degrees C. The ion conductivity of the electrolytes proved to be the main factor for the enhancement of the surface controlled capacitance of beta-MnO2 as the temperature increased. Therefore, when assembled with an AC to form an asymmetrical supercapacitor, beta-MnO2//AC can derive 12.9 W h kg(-1) at 9.5 kW kg(-1) with a superior cycling stability (91.8%, after 5000 cycles at 5 A g(-1)) at 5-50 degrees C, even after suffering from a sudden temperature change. This proves that the as-formed MnO2 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications requiring a high-performance over a broad temperature range.

We conducted an experiment on the effects of the grazing regimes rotational grazing (RG), continuous grazing (CG), and grazing exclusion (GE) on an alpine meadow in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The differences of plant community composition, soil microbial community assembly mechanism, and taxonomic and functional composition between grazing regimes were examined, and the relationship between plant species and the soil microbes was assessed by constructing a co-occurrence network. The results showed that the plant community composition varied with the grazing regimes, while the soil microbial community composition did not vary with the grazing regimes. The soil bacterial functional composition was similar under RG and CG, while the soil fungal functional composition was similar under GE and RG. The soil microbial community under all grazing regimes was assembled mainly according to stochastic rather than deterministic mechanisms, and RG and CG reduced the relative importance of the stochastic ratio. At the microbial phylum level, CG and GE increased the relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Armatimonadetes and CG and RG increased the relative abundance of Elusimicrobia. In the network of plant species and soil microbial classes, plants and bacteria themselves were mainly positively linked (symbiosis and promotion), while plants and soil microbes were mainly negatively linked (competition). There were five microbial generalists in the network, which connected with many microbes, and four showed no difference in their abundance among the grazing regimes. Overall, the stable key microbes in the network and the fact that many of the plants are unconnected with microbes weakened the impact of grazing-induced changes in the plant community on soil microbes, probably resulting in the stable soil microbial community composition. Moreover, there was still a dominant and tolerant plant species, Kobresia pygmaea, that connected the plant and microbial communities, implying that the dominant plant species not only played a crucial role in the plant community but also acted as a bridge between the plants and soil microbes; thus, its tolerance and dominance might stabilize the soil microbial community.

The nano-fillers were incorporated into the resin to prepare anti-corrosion coatings with the thickness of ca. 50 +/- 5 mu m The electrochemical and self-repairing properties of the LDH-doped coatings were studied by EIS and LEIS. Results indicated that the addition of LDH loaded with nitrite induced obvious increased in the impedance of coating (from 4.64 x 10(8) Omega cm(2) to 2.14 x 10(10) Omega cm(2)) and improved the anticorrosion performance of the coating. In addition, the localized corrosion of coatings could be largely inhibited, and the released nitrite ions from LDH interlayers exhibited active anticorrosion functions. When LDH nanosheets were added to the coatings, the lamella structures improved the barrier performances of the coatings. At the same time, the excellent ion exchanges ability of LDH could be used as storage stations for chloride ions, and the release of nitrite ions could play an active anti-corrosion role. Both of them cooperated to synergistically improve the anti-corrosion performance of the coating.

The properties of as-prepared catalyst were tested by diverse of characterization techniques. Importantly, the Co(OH)F@MXenes activates PMS to degrade BPA more efficiently (96.3% within 40 min) and stably than traditionally Co3O4 and CoO nanomaterials. Different influence factors of BPA degradation were also examined, including different catalyst, pH, temperature, BPA concentrations, PMS dosage, catalyst dosage and co-existing ions. The existence of Cl- and H2PO4- exhibit distinct positive synergistic effects on the catalytic process. The XPS and ICP techniques were applied to illustrate that the leach amount of cobalt ion was very litter. Thus, the reusable ability of Co(OH)F@MXenes without significant efficiency loss after multiple cycles. These results demonstrate that Co(OH)F@MXenes is an promisingly effective catalyst to activating PMS for BPA remove.

Crystal structure and morphology of samples were investigated by XRD, FTIR, SEM, HR-TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The characterization results indicate that citric acid accelerates the formation of leaf-like LiFePO4/C composite. The as-prepared leaf-like LiFePO4/C composite with an enlarged (010) plane has high dispersibility. By comparing the electrochemical properties of the LiFePO4/C particles in our study, the LiFePO4/C micro-leaves exhibit larger discharge capacity and better rate performance, which deliver a discharge capacity of 158 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1C and 126 mAh.g(-1) at 5C. The enhanced performance perhaps is attributed to the reduced Li-ion diffusion paths along the [010] direction and larger Li-ion diffusion coefficient.

The characterizations of samples indicated that substantial MMT mineral particles and Fe3O4 nanoparticle were dispersed on the surface of MMBC. Due to the introduction of Fe3O4, MMBC performed excellent magnetization property. The adsorption experiments of oxytetracycline (OTC) indicated that the maximum adsorption ability of MMBC was 58.85 mg.g(-1), which was 2.63 times as large as CLB, also, larger than that of MBC. Meanwhile, pH, ionic strength, and humic acid (HA) performed slight effects for adsorption of OTC on MMBC. In addition, MMBC still removed 92%, OTC after five regeneration cycles. Finally, primary mechanisms of OTC adsorption onto MMBC were attributed to hydrogen bonding and pi-pi reaction, and ion exchange reaction was considered to exist. Meanwhile, functional groups including Si-O-AL Si-O-Si, Si-O, and Fe3O4 nanoparticles would provide extra binding sites for OTC adsorption. Therefore, MMBC had an obvious potential to apply into water purification as a reliable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly adsorbent. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The role of crystallographic defects on structure evolution and performance degradation during electrochemical cycling is not yet fully understood. Here, we investigated the structural evolution of a Ni-rich NMC cathode in a solid-state cell by in situ transmission electron microscopy. Antiphase boundary (APB) and twin boundary (TB) separating layered phases played an important role on phase change. Upon Li depletion, the APB extended across the layered structure, while Li/transition metal (TM) ion mixing in the layered phases was detected to induce the rock-salt phase formation along the coherent TB. According to DFT calculations, Li/TM mixing and phase transition were aided by the low diffusion barriers of TM ions at planar defects. This work reveals the dynamical scenario of secondary phase evolution, helping unveil the origin of performance fading in Ni-rich NMC.

An experimental realisation of ballistic, phase-coherent superconductor-nanowire hybrid devices is a necessary step towards engineering topological superconducting electronics. Here, we report on a low-temperature transport study of Josephson junction devices fabricated from InSb nanowires grown by molecular-beam epitaxy and provide a clear evidence for phase-coherent, ballistic charge transport through the nanowires in the junctions. We demonstrate that our devices show gate-tunable proximity-induced supercurrent and clear signatures of multiple Andreev reflections in the differential conductance, indicating phase-coherent transport within the junctions. We also observe periodic modulations of the critical current that can be associated with the Fabry-Perot interference in the nanowires in the ballistic transport regime. Our work shows that the InSb nanowires grown by molecular-beam epitaxy are of excellent material quality and hybrid superconducting devices made from these nanowires are highly desirable for investigation of the novel physics in topological states of matter and for applications in topological quantum electronics.

The composite film was characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical behavior of the composite film was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, amperometry and electrochemical impedance spectra. The results show that the composite film exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic performance for the oxidation of dopamine, which is related to the V-V/V-IV and Co-II/Co-III couples. The proposed electrochemical sensor shows rather high sensitivity of 0.82 mu A/mu M, low detection limit of 1.3 x 10(-8) M (S/N = 3) and a linear response range from 8.3 x 10(-8) to 5.0 x 10(-4) M for detecting dopamine. Furthermore, compared to the single component polyoxometalate or cobalt(II) tetrasulfonate phthalocyanine film, the composite film shows superior catalytic efficiency, repeatability and long-term stability due to coexist of PMo11V and CoTsPc in the composite film. Therefore, this work demonstrates a successful paradigm for the fabrication of electroactive species in an organic/inorganic composite film, which can be potentially used for practical applications in electrochemical sensors.

The THMC model is developed, validated then applied to simulate CO2 enhanced recovery. Parametric studies are completed, systematically switching-off components of the thermal (T) and hydraulic (H) coupling, to provide insights into key processes controlling ECBM recovery and key factors. The evolution of permeability is strongly dependent on coal matrix swelling/shrinkage induced by gas adsorption/desorption, expansion by thermal effects, and compaction by effective stress. Reservoir permeability first decreases, then rebounds before continuously decreasing to low magnitude. Ignoring the impact of water migration overestimates CH4 production, and ignoring heat transfer underestimates. The high injection pressure and initial permeability will promote fluid mixture transport, resulting in an increase in production and sequestration; conversely, high injection temperature and water saturation will result in a decrease. Delaying injection start time is shown to counter the low average production rate and early CO2 breakthrough resulting from early injection (beginning at similar to 2500 days for this case).

Therefore, Rho kinases have become attractive targets for the treatments of many diseases, such as cancer, renal disease, hypertension, ischemia, and stroke. In order to develop small-molecule inhibitors of ROCK1, molecular docking was utilized to virtually screen two chemical databases and identify molecules that interact with ROCK1. A small set of virtual hits was purchased and submitted to a series of experimental assays. The in vitro enzyme-based and cell-based assays reveal that 12 compounds have good inhibitory activity against ROCK1 in the micro molar regime (IC50 values between about 7 and 28 mu M) and antitumor activity against lung cancer, breast cancer or/and myeloma cell lines. The structural analysis shows that two active compounds present novel scaffolds and are potential leads for the development of novel anticancer drugs. We then characterized the interaction patterns between ROCK1 and two inhibitors with novel scaffolds by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy decomposition analysis. In addition, the pharmacological effect of the two ROCK1 inhibitors with novel scaffolds on atorvastatin-induced cerebral hemorrhage was evaluated by using zebrafish model, and one compound candidate is able to prevent atorvastatin-induced cerebral hemorrhage effectively.

With PPh3, [3 + 2] annulations proceeded smoothly to afford dihydropyrrole derivatives in excellent yields. Under the catalysis of DABCO, [2 + 2] annulations occurred, producing azetidine derivatives in good to high yields. However, in the presence of pyridine, alpha,alpha'-disubstituted allenoates were obtained in very high yields via aza-Morita-Baylis-Hillman reactions. These studies provide an opportunity for diverse synthesis of a variety of N-heterocyclic compounds from the same starting materials.

At 125 degrees C for 2.5 h, furfural was completely converted to furan-2-ylmethanol (FM) over Co17Zn/NC600, while FM selectivity over Co/NC600 is only 70.6%. According to multiple characterizations, Co17Zn/NC600 (Co loading 17%, calcined at 600 degrees C) consists of flower-like spherical Co3ZnC nanoparticles (NPsCo(3)ZnC) uniformly distributed on its surface. The NPsCo(3)ZnC are the main active ingredients for highly selective furfural hydrogenation to FM, which is confirmed by furfural hydrogenation over Co-Zn/NC prepared with different Co loadings and different calcination temperatures. The excellent activity and stability of Co17Zn/NC600 were confirmed by recycling experiment and furfural conversion is still above 90% after repeated use of Co17Zn/NC600 for 8 cycles.

To avoid the limitations of traditional solid-state thermoelectric materials, such as frangibility and complex fabrication processes, we fabricated two types of thermogalvanic gel electrolytes with positive and negative thermo-electrochemical Seebeck coefficients, respectively, which correspond to the n-type and p-type elements of a conventional thermoelectric generator. Such gel electrolytes exhibit not only moderate thermoelectric performance but also good mechanical properties. Based on these electrolytes, a flexible and wearable thermocell was designed with an output voltage approaching 1 V by utilizing body heat. This work may offer a new train of thought for the development of self-powered wearable systems by harvesting low-grade body heat.

The results of the inverse models are very sensitive even to small biases in the data (Rayner and O'Brien 2001). In this work, we have evaluated ground-based high resolution Fourier Transform Spectrometer (g-b FTS) and the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) column-averaged dry air mole fraction of methane (XCH4) through aircraft in-situ observations over Anmyeondo station (36.538(o) N, 126.331(o) E, 30m above sea level). The impact of the spatial coincidence criteria was assessed by comparing GOSAT data against g-b FTS. We noticed there was no any systematic difference based on the given coincidence criteria. GOSAT exhibited a bias ranging from 0.10 to 3.37ppb, with the standard deviation from 4.92 to 12.54ppb, against g-b FTS with the spatial coincidence criteria of +/- 1, +/- 3, +/- 5 degrees of latitude and longitude and +/- 1h time window. Data observed during ascent and descent of the aircraft is considered as vertical profiles within an altitude range of 0.2 to a maximum of 9.0km so that some assumptions were applied for the construction of the profiles below 0.2 and above 9.0km. In addition, the suitability of aircraft data for evaluation of remote sensing instruments was confirmed based on the assessment of uncertainties. The spatial coincidence criteria is +/- 1(o) latitude and +/- 2(o) longitude and for temporal difference is +/- 1h of the satellite observation overpass time were applied, whereas g-b FTS data are the mean values measured within +/- 30min of the aircraft observation time. Furthermore, the sensitivity differences of the instruments were taken into account. With respect to aircraft, the g-b FTS data were biased by -0.19 +/- 0.69%, while GOSAT data were biased by -0.42 +/- 0.84%. These results confirm that both g-b FTS and GOSAT are consistent aircraft observations and assure the reliability of the datasets for inverse estimate of CH4.

Herein, three-dimensional fluffy PtPd nanocorals (NCs) loaded on two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) supports were successfully achieved by a simple one-step strategy based on ultraviolet (UV) laser-excited photochemical reaction. As for alcohol oxidation reaction, the h-BN/PtPd NCs with unique nanoporous surface provide more enhanced electrocatalytic performances than many previous nanocatalysts, owing to abundant active sites and plentiful charge-transfer channels formed on high electrode-electrolyte contact area. Especially, the mass activity of h-BN/PtPd NCs is about 962.8 mA mg(PtPd)(-1) in methanol oxidation reaction in alkaline solution, which can be maintained at similar to 274.9 mA mg(PtPd)(-1) (28.6% of the initial one) even after a 5 x 10(4) s durability test. The present work not only offers an advanced electrocatalyst for long-term fuel cells but also provides a versatile route for construction of complex metallic nanocomposites on 2D supports, holding great potential for diverse energy-related applications.

Cationic polymer dots (PDs) have been widely used for biomedical imaging and drug delivery due to their excellent photoluminescence, small size and abundant positive charge. In this study, polyethyleneimine (600 Da) (PEI600)-modified redox-responsive hyperbranched poly(amido amine) (PAA-PEI600) and partially carbonized PAA-PEI600 PDs were designed and prepared as vaccine carriers to deliver the model antigen protein ovalbumin (OVA). Then, OVA-specific immune responses induced by PAA-PEI600/OVA and PDs/OVA nanoparticles were evaluated in vivo. The results suggest that the PAA-PEI600/OVA and PDs/OVA nanoparticles enhanced OVA-specific immune responses when compared to OVA alone. Further, PDs/OVA nanoparticles induced more potent OVA-specific cellular immune responses, including higher levels of the OVA-specific IgG2a/IgG1 antibody ratio, splenocyte proliferation, IL-12 and IFN-gamma cytokines, maturation of dendritic cells, effector memory CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells as well as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) than PAA-PEI600/OVA nanoparticles did. Moreover, subcutaneously injected PDs/OVA nanoparticles significantly inhibited tumor growth of the mice bearing E.G7-OVA tumor and extended mice survival. All the results show that immunization with PDs/OVA nanoparticles elicited more effective OVA-specific cellular immune responses. PDs could serve as promising vaccine delivery systems for cancer immunotherapy.

Effect of zirconium addition on the impact toughness of the heat affected zone in a high strength low alloy pipeline steel	MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION			English	Article						high strength low alloy; pipeline steel; impact toughness; heat affected zone; zirconium	LOW-CARBON STEEL; ACICULAR FERRITE; 3-DIMENSIONAL MORPHOLOGY; INTRAGRANULAR FERRITE; NUCLEATION; INCLUSIONS; MICROSTRUCTURE; IMPROVEMENT; BORON	The effect of zirconium additions on the impact toughness of the heat affected zone in a high strength low alloy pipeline steel was studied, and the corresponding toughening mechanism examined when the welding was conducted with large heat input. The welding of steels was simulated on a Gleeble 2000. Microstructural observations, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction analyses were conducted using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The impact toughness of the heat affected zone was improved by addition of zirconium into steel, especially when a large welding heat input was used. This improvement is attributable to MnS precipitation on the pre-formed ZrO2 as well as the formation of intragranular ferrite. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Guo, A. M.; Wu, K.

However, the challenges in regulating electronic configuration and unveiling the mechanism on the atomic scale are hindering their practical implementation. Herein, we modulate the Co d-orbital electron configuration by constructing the Ir-Co atomic pair toward boosted bifunctional activity. The as-developed dual-atom IrCo-N-C catalyst displays unprecedented activity with a half-wave potential of 0.911 V for oxygen reduction reaction and only 330 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction, outperforming the single-atom counterparts as well as the commercial Pt/C and Ir/C benchmarks. The impressive bifunctionality is also verified in a Zn-air battery prototype with an ultra-high cyclability over 450 cycles. Theoretical calculations are performed to shed light on the synergetic effects of the atomic pair site, where the incorporation of Ir atom alters the d-orbital energy level of Co and thus induces the re-arrangement of d-electron toward intensified spin polarization. As a result, the lower occupancy of d(z)(2) orbital facilitates the electron acceptation from oxygen to form a stronger Co-O sigma bond, thereby propelling faster reaction kinetics.

Magnetic metal-organic frameworks (MOF5) of type MOF-5 were prepared and used as adsorbents of MSPE. Several main parameters influencing MSPE efficiency were investigated, including amount of magnetic MOF-5, sample solution pH, extraction time, salt concentration, type and volume of desorption solvents and desorption time. Under optimal conditions, the MSPE-HPLC method presented fast simple separation and analysis, and excellent linearity in the range of 0.3-500.0 mu g/L for carbendazim and triadimefon, and 0.1 -500.0 mu g/L for chlorfenapyr and fenpyroximate, with correlation coefficients (r) higher than 0.9992. High sensitivity with limits of detection and quantification ranging from 0.04-0.11 mu g/L and 0.13-0.35 mu g/L, respectively, were achieved, as well as good precision with relative standard deviations of 2.98-7.11% (intra-day) and 3.31-7.12% (inter-day). Furthermore, the method was successfully applied to reservoir and Yellow River water samples, and satisfactory recoveries at three spiked concentration levels were between 80.20% and 108.33%.The magnetic MOF-5 composites based MSPE followed by HPLC proved promising for convenient and efficient determination of heterocyclic pesticides in environmental water samples.

Here, a novel SnS2/TiO2 2D-2D ultrathin nanosheet heterostructure was fabricated via a hydrothermal route in two steps. The obtained 2D-2D SnS2/TiO2 nanojunction has not only provided large contact areas but also shortened the charge transport distance, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution property. The H-2 generation rate obtained for the optimized sample reaches 652.4 mu mol h(-1)g(1), far exceeding (similar to 8 times) that of pristine TiO2 and SnS2 ultrathin nanosheets under simulated solar irradiation. Moreover, further analysis reveals a photoinduced carrier transfer from TiO2 to SnS2 at the interface junction, which causes a partial reduction of the SnS2 cocatalyst to SnS in the nanocomposite during the photocatalytic reactions. These results not only demonstrate that the construction of 2D-2D heterojunction is a promising approach to improve the photocatalytic H-2 production activity of nanostructured semiconductor photocatalysts but also provide new understanding into the role and evolution of SnS2 nanosheets during the photocatalytic reaction process in heterogeneous photocatalyst systems.

Two maize inbred lines, DAN3130 and JI63, with different patterns of folate accumulation and different total folate contents in mature kernels were used to investigate the transcriptional regulation of folate metabolism during late stages of kernel formation by comparative transcriptome analysis. The folate accumulation during DAP 24 to mature kernels could be controlled by circumjacent pathways of folate biosynthesis, such as pyruvate metabolism, glutamate metabolism, and serine/glycine metabolism. In addition, the folate variation between these two inbred lines was related to those genes among folate metabolism, such as genes in the pteridine branch, para-aminobenzoate branch, serine/tetrahydrofolate (THF)/5-methyltetrahydrofolate cycle, and the conversion of THF monoglutamate to THF polyglutamate. The findings provided insight into folate accumulation mechanisms during maize kernel formation to promote folate biofortification.

Here, cationic vacancies on nickel phosphide, as a proof-of-concept to regulate the catalyst's physicochemical properties, are introduced for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis. The as-fabricated Ni cationic vacancies (V-Ni)-enriched Ni2-xP-V-Ni electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable 2e ORR performance with H2O2 molar fraction of >95% and Faradaic efficiencies of >90% in all pH conditions under a wide range of applied potentials. Impressively, the as-created V-Ni possesses superb long-term durability for over 50 h, suppassing all the recently reported catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis. Operando X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) combining theoretical calculations reveal that the excellent catalytic performance originates from the V-Ni-induced geometric and electronic structural optimization, thus promoting oxygen adsorption to the 2e ORR favored "end-on" configuration. It is believed that the demonstrated cation vacancy engineering is an effective strategy toward creating active heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision.

Inclusion of the sulfoxide, amine, and sulfide functionalities can enhance S-CO2/CH4 (selectivity of CO2 over CH4), while the pyrrole and pyridine functionalities could not. The higher mole fraction of CO2 could reduce the pressure required to reach the stable equilibrium state as well as S-CO2/CH4. Microporous calculation results suggest that the microporous size distribution (MSD) of amine-CVMM (median pore size, D-M, 8.24 angstrom; free volume probed by He, V(F)d, 7105.55 angstrom(3)/cell) and sulfoxide CVMM (D-M, 7.92 angstrom; V-d(F), 7812.96 angstrom(3)/cell) are most suitable for CH4 adsorption, followed by pyrrole-CVMM (D-M, 7.18 angstrom; V-d(F), 6812.96 angstrom(3)/cell). The inclusion of N and S functionalities can distinctly increase the adsorption affinity of the linear molecular configurations of adsorbates by changing the adsorption orientations. The target N and S functionalities in functionalized CVMMs contribute primarily to the adsorption process of these three gaseous adsorbates. The adjacent functionalities have critical influences on adsorption affinity for these three adsorbate species depending upon the relative adsorption affinity strength of the adjacent functionalities and the target functionalities.

However, a major challenge of FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O is its low conductivity. In this work, Fe1-2x/3MnxF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07) are prepared via the solvent thermal method. Systematic investigations have studied the effect of Mn-doping on the physical and electrochemical properties. The results indicate that Mn-doping not only does not destroy the lattice structure of FeF3 center dot 0.33H(2)O, but also reduces the resistance and improves the diffusion coefficient of lithium ion, which provide it with better electrochemical properties. Fe0.98Mn0.03F3 center dot 0.33H(2)O delivers much excellent cycling performance and rate capacity than other materials. It has a 284.2 mAh g(-1) initial discharge capacity that remains at 258.9 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1 C, giving the high capacity retention rate of 91.1%.

This work provided a probe for Pb(II) ion detection in purified drinking water. Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) films were prepared by vacuum evaporating nickel fine wire and transforming in a potassium ferricyanide solution on the front surface of platinum coated n-silicon. The transformed NiHCF film shows a reversible insertion electrochemistry and possesses electrocatalytic activity under illumination. The NiHCF-modified electrode was used as photoelectrode and dihydroxybenzene as photocurrent mediators to make up photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for Pb(II) ion detection in purified drinking water based on a two-electrode cell in absence of reference electrode and operated at zero working voltage. We have investigated the effects of Pb(II) ions on the photocurrent of hydroquinone or catechol in the purified water. The assay demonstrated good photocurrent responses by adding different concentrations of Pb(II) ion into purified drinking water with a linear range of 20-1560nM and the limit of determination (based on S/N=3) is 4.8nM and 5.3nM for the presence of hydroquinone and catechol, respectively.

Approaches to investigate crop responses to ozone pollution: from O-3-FACE to satellite-enabled modeling	PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article						air pollution; free air concentration enrichment; oxidative stress response; genetic variation	ELEVATED TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; AMBIENT AIR-POLLUTION; ENRICHMENT FACE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; AGRICULTURAL CROPS; SOYBEAN CULTIVARS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; GLOBAL BURDEN; UNITED-STATES; STOMATAL FLUX	Ozone (O-3) is a damaging air pollutant to crops. As one of the most reactive oxidants known, O-3 rapidly forms other reactive oxygen species (ROS) once it enters leaves through stomata. Those ROS in turn can cause oxidative stress, reduce photosynthesis, accelerate senescence, and decrease crop yield. To improve and adapt our feed, fuel, and food supply to rising O-3 pollution, a number of Free Air Concentration Enrichment (O-3-FACE) facilities have been developed around the world and have studied key staple crops. In this review, we provide an overview of the FACE facilities and highlight some of the lessons learned from the last two decades of research. We discuss the differences between C-3 and C-4 crop responses to elevated O-3, the possible trade-off between productivity and protection, genetic variation in O-3 response within and across species, and how we might leverage this observed variation for crop improvement. We also highlight the need to improve understanding of the interaction between rising O-3 pollution and other aspects of climate change, notably drought. Finally, we propose the use of globally modeled O-3 data that are available at increasing spatial and temporal resolutions to expand upon the research conducted at the limited number of global O-3-FACE facilities.

There is no effective biological pesticide to prevent the take-all disease of wheat. 2-Hydroxyphenazine (2-OH-PHZ) was reported to possess a better inhibitory effect on the take-all disease of wheat than phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, which was registered as "Shenqinmycin" in China in 2011. The aim of this study was to construct a 2-OH-PHZ high-producing strain by strain screening, genome sequencing, genetic engineering, and fermentation optimization. First, the metabolites of the previously screened new phenazine-producing Pseudomonas sp. strain were identified, and the taxonomic status of the new Pseudomonas sp. strain was confirmed through 16S rRNA and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Then, the new Pseudomonas sp. strain was named Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aurantiaca LX24, which is a new subspecies of P. chlororaphis that can synthesize 2-OH-PHZ. Next, the draft genome of strain LX24 was determined, and clusters of orthologous group (COG) analysis, KEGG analysis, and gene ontology (GO) analysis of strain LX24 were performed. Furthermore, the production of 2-OH-PHZ increased to 351.7 from 158.6 mg/L by deletion of the phenazine synthesis negative regulatory genes rpeA and rsmE in strain LX24. Finally, the 2-OH-PHZ production of strain LX24 reached 677.1 mg/L after fermentation optimization, which is the highest production through microbial fermentation reported to date. This work provides a reference for the efficient production of other pesticides and antibiotics.

The magnetic clays have ordered structure, rich functional groups and strong magnetism as verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning and transmission electron microscope (SEM, TEM), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Subsequently, the magnetic diatomite (MDC) and illite clay (MIC) were used as adsorbents for fast and efficient removal of phosphate from aqueous solution by batch equilibrium experiments. The adsorption kinetic, isothermal and mechanistic properties were studied. The results demonstrated that the phosphate adsorption onto MDC and MIC was pH-dependent, completed within 30 min and possessed higher capacities than the raw clays. The adsorption kinetic and isotherm data followed the pseudo-second-order equation and the Langmuir model, respectively. The adsorption mechanisms of phosphate were ascribed to the electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange. Furthermore, the MDC and MIC endowed a superior selectivity, regeneration, reusability and can be quickly and easily separated using a magnet before and after the adsorption process.

Absorption coefficient of urban aerosol in Nanjing, west Yangtze River Delta, China	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							BLACK CARBON AEROSOLS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; LIGHT-ABSORPTION; RURAL SITE; AETHALOMETER; INSTRUMENT; EMISSIONS	Absorbing aerosols can significantly modulate short-wave solar radiation in the atmosphere, affecting regional and global climate. The aerosol absorption coefficient (AAC) is an indicator that assesses the impact of absorbing aerosols on radiative forcing. In this study, the near-surface AAC and absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent (AAE) in the urban area of Nanjing, China, are characterized on the basis of measurements in 2012 and 2013 using the seven-channel Aethalometer (model AE-31, Magee Scientific, USA). The AAC is estimated with direct and indirect corrections, which result in consistent temporal variations and magnitudes of AAC at 532 nm. The mean AAC at 532 nm is about 43.23 +/- 28.13 M m(-1) in the urban area of Nanjing, which is much lower than that in Pearl River Delta and the same as in rural areas (Lin'an) in Yangtze River Delta. The AAC in the urban area of Nanjing shows strong seasonality (diurnal variations); it is high in cold seasons (at rush hour) and low in summer (in the afternoon). It also shows synoptic and quasi-2-week cycles in response to weather systems. Its frequency distribution follows a typical log-normal pattern. The 532 nm AAC ranging from 15 to 65 M m(-1) dominates, accounting for more than 72% of the total data samples in the entire study period. Frequent high pollution episodes, such as those observed in June 2012 and in winter 2013, greatly enhanced AAC and altered its temporal variations and frequency distributions. These episodes are mostly due to local emissions and regional pollution. Air masses flowing from northern China to Nanjing can sometimes be highly polluted and lead to high AAC at the site. AAE at 660/470 nm from the Schmid correction (Schmid et al., 2006) is about 1.56, which might be more reasonable than from the Wein-gartner correction (Weingartner et al., 2003). Low AAEs mainly occur in summer, likely due to high relative humidity (RH) in the season. AAC increases with increasing AAE at a fixed aerosol loading. The RH-AAC relationship is more complex. Overall, AAC peaks at RH values of around 40% (1.3 < AAE < 1.6), 65% (AAE < 1.3 and AAE > 1.6), and 80% (1.3 < AAE < 1.6).	[Zhuang, B. L.; Wang, T. J.; Liu, J.; Yin, C.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the size of the MNPs gradually increased with increasing the initial temperature at which reaction components were mixed while the reaction component's mixing time was kept constant. The smallest sized MNPs were achieved among the five treatments (25, 50, 75, 100, and 125 ???C) when reactionIP: components14.98.160.66 wereOn: mixWed, at22 5 ???JunC, 2022while the06:31:08larger sized MNPs were synthesized among the five treatments when reaction components were mixed at 125 ???C. Then, Stober method was followed for coating Copyright: American Sc entific Publishers silica layer onto the MNPs. However, ammonium hydroxidwas replaced with potassium hydroxide as a catalyst, which Delivered by ngenta significantly increased the speed of silica coating onto MNPs. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer revealed that the MNPs were successfully covered with silica in five minutes. FTIR spectra exhibited a peak about 1088.8 cm-1, which belonged to the asymmetry stretching vibration of Si-O-Si. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) analysis was conducted to confirm the presence of silica layer onto MNPs. Thus, potassium hydroxide was successfully employed as a catalyst for quick silica layer coating onto MNPs. Furthermore, these silica coated MNPs were used to extract high quality nucleic acids from blood sample.

Zinc nitrate and urea are used as activator, porogen and nitrogen source, which generate gases moderately and avoid the risk of explosion in calcination. This method endows the biochar products with abundant micropores and extraordinary large N and O doping content (>20% in atomic ratio). Such large doping content leads to super-hydrophilicity, which in turn makes the micropores available for charge storage. In addition, under a moderate calcination condition (700 celcius, 2 h), the biochar material gains large conductivity, without diminishing the super-hydrophilicity. Theoretical analysis on characterizations demonstrates that, the higher ratio of sp2 C and larger proportion of quaternary N (N-Q) in this material (CNO700) account for its much higher conductivity. The synergetic effect of large pore volume (0.69 cm3 center dot g- 1), high N and O doping content, proper ratio of N species and large conductivity (0.713 S center dot m- 1) makes the material (CNO700) exhibit high and durable specific capacitance, i.e., 391.0 F center dot g- 1 at 0.5 A center dot g- 1, and cycling stably for >25,000 times at 10.0 A center dot g- 1 with good capacitance retention.

Two high speed cameras in stereo configuration allowed 3D position and 3D velocity measurements of burning iron particles as well as 3D evaluation of particle microexplosions. Microexplosive processes are important since it can affect both combustion stability and formation of product components. The observed microexplosions happened bet ire particle extinction resulting in change of trajectories, velocities, radiation intensities and fragmentation into smaller particles. It was observed for the first time that fragments of these microexplosions tend to produce planar structures. A frequent release phenomenon was observed during the iron particle combustion using magnified thermal radiation imaging and high-speed shadowgraphy. This release phenomenon was indirectly confirmed with scanning electron microscopy of combust products, revealing multiple cracked particle shells and hollow structures. Black body radiation characteristics was observed indicating the release being in condensed phase and emission spectroscopy identified FeO as intermediate species during combustion. The observed release is believed to mainly consist of iron-oxide nanoparticles formed in the homogenous reaction between vapor iron and oxidizers.

In this work, an agricultural waste of citrus peel (CP) was used to detoxify COPR by the pyrolysis process, and the resulted residue (DT-COPR) was used as the adsorbent to treat simulated nickel ion (Ni2+) wastewater. The effects of pyrolysis parameters on the COPR detoxification efficiency and adsorption performance of Ni2+ were investigated simultaneously. Besides, operating parameters on the adsorption efficiency and capacity of Ni2+ were also studied and the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherms were summarized correspondingly. The results show not only water-soluble but also insoluble (Cr(VI)) in the COPR can be effectively reduced by the pyrolysis process, and the total Cr(VI) decreased from 1641.98 mg/kg to 8.04 mg/kg that can be used safely as an adsorbent. The characterization results of DTCOPR also show that the new adsorbent exhibits good thermal stability and full of chemical functional groups, and adsorption equilibrium of nearly up to 100% of Ni2+ removal efficiency with DT-COPR was achieved within 10-60 min. The adsorption process of Ni2+ can be accurately described by the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherm, and the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) for Ni2+ could reach as high as 18.18 mg/g. This study provided an alternative treatment of bio-safety disposal and resource-oriented utilization of the COPR.

However, the response of soil bacteria in an alpine steppe to these changes is largely unknown. In this study, a field experiment was performed on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to determine the changes in soil bacterial communities of alpine steppes in response to nitrogen application and warming. The experiment consisted of four treatments, namely no-N application with no-warming (CK), N application (8 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) with no-warming (N), warming with no-N application (W), and N application (8 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) with warming (W&N). This study aimed to investigate (1) the changes in soil bacterial diversity and community structure under simulated nitrogen deposition and warming conditions, and (2) the key environmental factors responsible for these changes. Based on the results, soil bacterial diversity and community composition did not change significantly in the short term. Warming had a significant effect on overall bacterial composition, rare species composition, and individual bacterial taxa. Besides, the interaction between nitrogen application and warming had a significant effect on community beta-diversity. Above-ground plant variables were highly correlated with bacterial community characteristics. Nitrogen application and warming did not significantly alter the distribution range of the bacterial community. Overall, this study suggests that soil bacterial communities can remain relatively stable at the level of simulated nitrogen application and warming and that short-term climatic changes may have no significant impacts on soil bacterial communities.

Nonetheless, amelioration on the configuration and electronic microstructure of CTFs for enhanced photocatalytic performance is still challenging and anticipated. Herein, we developed a new strategy to synthesize visible-light-driven Cl-intercalated CTF-1 photocatalysts (labeled as Cl-ECF) via a ball-milling exfoliation-assisted acidification method. Many characterizations confirm the formation of Cl-C and Cl-N bonds in the Cl-ECF. The effects of the Cl-intercalation on the crystal structure, microstructure and charge transfer behaviors of CTF-1 were systematically studied by various characterizations and DFT calculation. The results revealed that Cl-ECF exhibited significantly promoted charge transfer, narrowed bandgap and enhanced photocatalytic activity of H-2 production because Cl-C and Cl-N covalent bonds can form covalently interlayer channels in the Cl-ECF. The as-prepared Cl-ECF shows a hydrogen production rate of 1.296 mmol.g(-1) h(-1) under visible light irradiation, which is 2.2 times higher than that of CTF-1. This work could provide new insights into the new approach of intercalation modification to improve photocatalytic performance of 2D layered photocatalysts.

A field manipulative experiment was conducted in a coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest of the subtropical-temperate transition zone in Central China to evaluate the responses of soil respiration to fire and N addition from July 2014 to December 2018. The results showed that fire significantly stimulated soil respiration by 17.5% whereas N addition had no effects across the whole experimental period. The enhancement of soil respiration intensified with year after fire, being neutral during the first two years but statistically significant in the later three years, which could be attributable to interannual variations of the changes in soil temperature and the cover of woody species. By contrast, a global meta-analysis on soil respiration responses to fire in forests revealed no overall changes in soil respiration and the negative effects were observed between one and three years after the fire and in subtropical forests (-36.6%) only. The contrast findings highlight that general patterns revealed by meta-analyses may not be able to predict ecosystem responses to environment change at a specific site.

To analyze rejection and antiapoptotic effects of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in kidney transplantations, to investigate the protective effects of endogenous HO-1 induced by hemin on acute rat kidney allograft rejection. Methods. We selected 27 Brown-Norway rats and 27 male Lewis rats as donors and recipients, respectively, randomly dividing them into three groups: kidney transplantation alone, hemin treatment group, and cyclosporine (CsA) group (n = 18). Six recipient rats were harvested on the first, fifth, or seventh days after operation among each group to examine histopathologic changes in renal tissuse, HO-1 protein expression, and acute rejection as well as to measure serum creatinine values. Results. HO-1 expression in both the kidney transplantation model group and the hemin-induced groups were higher compared with the CsA group (P < .05.01). The expression increased with the aggravation of rejection; the expression in the CsA group also increased after transplantation but was obviously lower than that of the hemin-induced group (P < .01). The rejection process was relatively mild as indenset by histopathologic examination. The serum creatinine levels among the hemin-induced group were lower compared to the kidney transplantation control group (P < .05), but higher compared to the CsA group (P < .05). Conclusion. HO-1 provided protection of allografts against rejection in rats, but such effects were poorer than those achieved using potent immunosuppressive agents like CsA.

Five groups of hydrate samples were formed to investigate the effect of hydrate reservoir properties on CH4-CO2 replacement reaction. The results showed that CH4 in the hydrate gradually moves to the liquid CO2 phase while CO2 in the liquid phase penetrates into the hydrate under pressure-temperature conditions not only within the phase zone surrounded by (L-CO2-V-CO2), (water-H-CO2-L-CO2), and (water-H-CH4-V-CH4) curves but also that above (L-CO2-V-CO2) and (water-H-CH4-V-CH4) curves. The replacement rate and amount of CH4 increase with the increase of hydrate saturation in the sediments. Compared with injecting gaseous CO2 method, liquid CO2 injection is also benefit for the recovery of CH4 from hydrate reservoir with much free water or that without underlying gas room to the extent that the injection of liquid CO2 is kept by high gas saturation. The replacement percent of CH4 hydrate decreases with the increase of hydrate saturation, but increases with the increase of water saturation. A higher replacement percent is obtained in the zone surrounded by three phase curves of (L-CO2-V-CO2), (water-H-CO2-L-CO2) and (water-H-CH4-V-CH4). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M-Z18 from glycerol was investigated in a 5-L jar-fermenter. Batch fermentations by Streptomyces sp. M-Z18 at various pH values ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 were studied. Based on the analysis of the time course of specific cell growth rate and specific epsilon-PL formation rate, a novel two-stage pH control strategy was developed to improve epsilon-PL production by shifting the culture pH from 3.5 to 3.8 after 36 h of cultivation. By applying the strategy, the maximal epsilon-PL concentration and productivity had a significant improvement and reached 9.13 g L(-1) and 4.76 g L(-1) day(-1), respectively, compared with those in one-stage pH control process where the pH value is controlled at 3.5 (7.83 g L(-1) and 3.13 g L(-1) day(-1)). Fed-batch fermentation with two-stage pH control strategy was also applied to produce epsilon-PL; final epsilon-PL concentration of 30.11 g L(-1) was obtained, being 3.3-fold greater than that of batch fermentation. To our knowledge, it is the first report on production of epsilon-PL from glycerol in fermenter scale and achievement of high epsilon-PL production with two-stage pH control strategy.

Forest burning leads to the discharge of large amounts of particles and trace gases that play an important role in air quality degradation and have impact on human health. To date, most studies on China's forest fire emissions have concentrated in certain regions, also with a relatively coarse temporal resolution. In this study, we used the INteractive Fire and Emission algoRithm for Natural envirOnments (INFERNO), as well as high-resolution land cover data to compile a forest fire emission inventory for China in 2020. The variations of forest combustion emissions were then analyzed at the provincial and seasonal level. The results show that forest fires were concentrated in southern China and northeastern China, which are in agreement with MODIS observations. Total CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, SO2, PM2.5, OC, and BC emissions were estimated to be 3.06 x 10(4), 1.87 x 10(3), 96.92, 34.95, 13.84, 208, 116.03, and 9.95 Gg, respectively. Provinces with higher emissions were found in Yunnan, Guangdong, Hunan, and Sichuan. Peak emission from forest fire occurred in spring and winter, mainly from January to April, during which contributed 70% of the total forest fire contaminants emissions. The algorithm used in this study can be easily coupled in the meteorological model and air quality model to estimate the occurrence of fire and calculate pollutant emission online. This study updated emissions information that may support future research and policy development on greenhouse gas reduction and air pollution control.

However, few studies have investigated the characteristics of macrolithotypes across multiple length scales. Here, the macrolithotype description was performed for the No. 3, 5, and 11 coal seams in the Hancheng Block of Ordos Basin. The cleats were characterized by optical microscopy and X-ray computed tomography (CT) while pores and their connectivity were determined from mercury intrusion porosimetry, N-2 and CO2 adsorption, and low field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of water saturated cores evaluated both cleats and pores. The CH4 adsorption capacity of coal samples scraped from the surface of the macrolithotype layers was also determined. Dull lithotypes (semi -dull and dull) were dominant, followed by bright lithotypes (bright and semi-bright) in these seams. The bright lithotype coal has a higher microfracture density (averaging 339 microcleats per 9 cm(2), ism -mm), better connectivity, and a larger fractal dimension (averaging 1.7) from optical microscopy. The dull lithotype has a lower average microfracture density (272 microcleats per 9 cm(2)) and a smaller fractal dimension (-1.6). This higher connectivity observation was consistent with X-ray CT observations and low field NMR of the water saturated cores (and the transition upon water removal from the fractures and larger pores). Also the ease of mercury injection from cores also supported higher connectivity in the bright lithotypes. Both the semi-bright and semi-dull lithotypes have equivalent pore proportions micro-to macropores and good apparent connectivity at the nm-prn scale; despite mineral occlusions. Based on the CH4 adsorption capacities of the macrolithotypes, the bright coal has the greatest gas adsorption capacity, due to the largest smaller micropores (<2 nm) and a higher specific surface area. These observations aid in understanding the complex behavior observed in CBM extraction and evaluating the impacts of heterogeneity and scale on the degassing behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Performances of three methods of coordinate rotation: double rotation (DR), triple rotation (TR), and classic planar-fit rotation (PF) were examined in terms of correction of eddy covariance flux. Using the commonly used DR and TR methods, unreasonable rotation angles are encountered at low wind speeds and cause significant run-to-run errors of some turbulence characteristics. The PF method rotates the coordinate system to an ensemble-averaged plane, and shows large tilt error due to an inaccurate fit plane over variable terrain slopes. In this paper, we propose another coordinate rotation scheme. The observational data were separated into two groups according to wind direction. The PF method was adapted to find an ensemble-averaged streamline plane for each group of hourly runs with wind speed exceeding 1.0 m s(-1). Then, the coordinate systems were rotated to their respective best-fit planes for all available hourly observations. We call this the PF10 method. The implications of tilt corrections for the turbulence characteristics are discussed with a focus on integral turbulence characteristics, the spectra of wind-velocity components, and sensible heat and momentum fluxes under various atmospheric stabilities. Our results show that the adapted application of PF provides greatly improved estimates of integral turbulence characteristics in complex terrain and maintains data quality. The comparisons of the sensible heat fluxes for four coordinate rotation methods to fluxes before correction indicate that the PF10 scheme is the best to preserve consistency between fluxes.

Due to low charge-transfer resistance and fast electron migration, Co-Bi25FeO40 showed superior catalytic efficiencies for activation PDS to degrade over 92.0% of bisphenol A (BPA) with the initial concentrations ranging from 40 mg/L to 120 mg/L in 5.0 min. The non-radical oxidation pathway via electron transfer regime on the surface of Co-Bi25FeO40 was the dominant reactive species in the reaction system. Benefit from the energy transfer and cross-coupling reactions of microwave, the Co-Bi25FeO40/MW/PDS system can generate abundant reactive sites to facilitate the formation of more surface-bonding complexes. Microwave energy can be absorbed by Co-Bi25FeO40 catalysts to promote activation of PDS and production of nanobubbles. The generated nanobubbles increase the temperature of the local solution to promote the reaction. The Co-Bi25FeO40/MW/PDS system also exhibited excellent bactericidal capability for Escherichia coli (E.coli). The catalysts, oxidants and microwaves acted on E. coli to form physical, and oxidative pressure simultaneously, causing cell damaged and made bacterial death. This work provides prospects toward high-efficiency integration of contaminant purification and pathogenic microorganisms inactivation.

The Mesosilica/Pal composite is consisted of mesosilica coated Pal nanorods and prepared through a dual template approach using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and Pal as soft and hard templates, respectively. The composition and structure of the resultant material was characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmissionelectron microscopy (TEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis, small-angle X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD), and zeta potential measurement. Adsorption experiments were carried out with different absorbents at different contact times and pH levels. Compared with Pal and MCM-41, the mesosilica/Pal composite exhibited the best efficiency for MO adsorption. Its adsorption ratio is as high as 70.4%. Its adsorption equilibrium time is as short as 30 min. Results testify that the MO retention is promoted for the micro-mesoporous hierarchical structure and positive surface charge electrostatic interactions of the mesosilica/Pal composite. The regenerability of the mesosilica/Pal composite absorbent was also assessed. 1D morphology makes it facile to separate from aqueous solutions. It can be effortlessly recovered and reused for up to nine cycles.

Soil microbes play an important role in the decomposition of green manure. However, few studies focused on the relationship between the release of nutrients and bacterial community diversity when different rates of green manure are applied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamic changes in soil bacterial communities and nutrient release during the decomposition of the green manure Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) residues in a new type Italian ryegrass-rice (Oryza saliva L.) rotation (IRR) system in South China. Six different rates (P0-P5) of Italian ryegrass were added to rice-growing red soil (Ferralic Cambisol) and allowed to decompose for 40 d (sampled every 10 d). Nutrient release and soil properties were determined during the decomposition and Illumina reads of the 16S rRNA gene amplicons were used to analyse changes in the bacterial communities. The addition of residues increased both nutrient concentrations (e.g., total nitrogen, available nitrogen and available potassium) and the relative abundance of microbes involved in nutrient cycling (e.g., Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Gerrunatinumadetes). Italian ryegrass residues had much faster rates of decomposition at 1-10 d, 11-20 d, and 21-30 d (from 183.2 to 238.1 g kg(-1), on average) than that (45.6 g kg(-1)) at 31-40 d. Overall, the high green manure decomposition rates were accompanied by high similarities in bacterial community structures during decomposition. The nutrient cycle efficiency and bacterial community diversity were higher when the soils were treated with 40,170-44,895 kg ha(-1) (P3-4) of green manure than other treatments. The average Shannon index values following the 44,895 kg ha(-1) (P4) treatment were the highest among the different rates of residue application, and they were 6.42 at 10 d, 6.37 at 20 d, 6.29 at 30 d, and 6.53 at 40 d. The highest soil total nitrogen concentrations of 1.4-2.0 g kg(-1), were obtained following the 40,170 kg ha(-1) (P3) treatment, and seedling biomass increased the most under P3 treatment. In addition, soil total nitrogen and available potassium concentrations were significantly correlated with rice seedling biomass. This study demonstrates that the management of green manure application based on the IRR system facilitates rice growth by improving bacterial communities (composition and diversity) and soil fertility, and it provides a new perspective on the links between potential microbial community functions and organic agro-ecosystems.

Catalytic hemin (Hem) was extracted from the active centers of Hb for the gold biomineralization and then reconstituted into apoHb to yield the Hem-Au@apoHb nanocomposites showing dramatically improved intrinsic catalysis and electrocatalysis over natural Hb and Hem. The biomineralized gold, on the one hand, would act as "nanowires" to promote the electron transferring of the nanocomposites. On the other hand, it would create a reactivity pathway to pre-organize and accumulate more substrates towards the active sites of the peroxidase mimics. Steady-state kinetics studies indicate that Hem-Au@apoHb could present much higher substrate affinity (lower Michaelis constants) and intrinsic catalysis even than some natural peroxidases. Moreover, the application feasibility of the prepared artificial enzymes was demonstrated by colorimetric assays and direct electrocatalysis for H2O2 sensing, showing a detection limitation low as 0.45 mu M. Importantly, such a catalysis active-center reconstitution protocol may circumvent the substantial improvement of the intrinsic catalysis and electrocatalysis of diverse heme-containing proteins or enyzmes toward the extensive applications in the chemical, enviromental, and biomedical catalysis fields.

However, there is a lack of in situ research on the characteristics of soil N2O concentration and flux in response to variations in soil properties caused by FTCs. Here, we report the effect of FTC-induced changes in soil properties on the soil N2O concentration and flux in the permafrost region of the higher reaches of the Shule River Basin on the northeastern margin of the QTP. We measured chemical properties of the topsoil, activities of soil microorganisms, and air temperature (AT), as well as soil N2O concentration and flux, over an annual cycle from July 31, 2011, to July 30, 2012. The results showed that soil N2O concentration was significantly affected by soil temperature (ST), soil moisture (SM), soil salinity (SS), soil polyphenol oxidase (SPO), soil alkaline phosphatase (SAP), and soil culturable actinomycetes (SCA), ranked as SM>SS>ST>SPO>SAP>SCA, whereas ST significantly increased soil N2O flux, compared with SS. Overall, our study indicated that the soil N2O concentration and flux in permafrost zone FTCs were strongly affected by soil properties, especially soil moisture, soil salinity, and soil temperature.

Methods: The current study population was derived from the Hangzhou Birth Cohort Study. Whole blood and urine samples were collected from mothers during 20-28 gestational week. The concentrations of 11 metals in blood and 11 metals in urine were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The data on placental characteristics and birth weight were retrieved from medical records. The elastic net (ENET) model combined with unpenalized regression model was employed to estimate the relationship between levels of metals and placental characteristics (placental weight, chorionic disc area, chorionic disc eccentricity, placental thickness, placental-fetal birth weight ratio) and birth weight. Mediation analysis was performed to explore the mediated effect of placenta on the association of prenatal metals exposure with birth weight. Results: Among 512 participants with urine metal levels, the ENET model retained Cadmium (Cd) and Selenium (Se) for placental weight. Further unpenalized regression model including Cd and Se simultaneously showed that one-unite increased natural-logarithm (hi)-transformed urine creatinine corrected (CC) Cd levels was associated with reductions in placental weight of -72 g (95% confidence interval (CI): -14.0, -0.4). Among 483 participants with blood metal levels, similarly, blood Cd levels were negatively associated with placental weight (beta =-7.5, 95% CI: -17.0, 1.9). Furthermore, mediation analysis demonstrated that urine CC-Cd level was associated with a 21.3 g decrease (95% CI: -42.0, -25, p - 0.024) in birth weight through a reduction in placental weight, while blood Cd levels presented a negative association at borderline significance. Conclusion: Our findings suggest a mediation effect of the placenta in the relationship between prenatal Cd exposure and lower birth weight. Additional studies with repeated assessment of exposure and more placental parameters are warranted to confirm this relationship. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Extracellular enzymes play critical roles on the degradation of soil organic matter, and measurements of their activities are potentially useful indicators of SR. The links between soil extracellular enzymatic activities (EEAs) and SR under N addition, however, have not been established. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis from 62 publications to synthesize the responses of soil EEAs and SR to elevated N. Nitrogen addition significantly increased glycosidase activity (GA) by 13.0%, alpha-1,4-glucosidase (AG) by 19.6%, beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG) by 11.1%, beta-1,4-xylosidase (BX) by 21.9% and beta-D-cellobiosidase (CBH) by 12.6%. Increases in GA were more evident for long duration, high rate, organic and mixed N addition (combination of organic and inorganic N addition), as well as for studies from farmland. The response ratios (RRs) of GA were positively correlated with the SR-RRs, even when evaluated individually for AG, BG, BX and CBH. This positive correlation between GA-RR and SR-RR was maintained for most types of vegetation and soil as well as for different methods of N addition. Our results provide the first evidence that GA is linked to SR under N addition over a range of ecosystems and highlight the need for further studies on the response of other soil EEAs to various global change factors and their implications for ecosystem functions.

Among all the food safety problems, antibiotic residues in animal derived foods are one of the most serious food contaminations that threaten human health seriously. However, the conventional techniques for monitoring and detection of antibiotics have shortcomings such as complicated sample pretreatment procedures, complex and time-consuming operations, dependence on expensive and bulky instruments, need for skilled professional personnel as well as poor selectivity and sensitivity, thus limiting their applications. Scope and approach: The emergence of aptamers provides a new novel probe for the establishment of aptasensors to circumvent those drawbacks because of their outstanding superiorities. Thus, the application of aptamers for monitoring and detection of antibiotic residues has attracted increasing attention and has become one of the research hotspots in the past years, showing a great potential for practical transformation and commercialization. Key findings and conclusions: In this review, the recent progresses of aptamer selection against various antibiotics were first presented. Then, the design and fabrication of various nanomaterials based aptasensors for monitoring and detection of antibiotic residues in animal derived foods were systematically summarized, with anticipation to avoid repeated work on aptamer selection and provide new insight and point out the future direction into the development of aptasensors for antibiotic detection.

SEM-EDS, XPS, BET.etc. characterizations indicated that the sphere NZVI particles were loaded on the zeolite successfully and the aggregation was restrained. The adsorption performance of PZ-NZVI for norfloxacin (NOR) or ofloxacin (OFL), two typical fluoroquinolones (FQs), from water was conducted. The equilibrium studies were demonstrated using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Elovich isotherms and better agreement was attained with the Temkin model. Compared with NZVI and zeolite, PZ-NZVI had higher FQs removal efficiency, and the Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity was 54.67 mg g(-1) (NOR) and 48.88 mg g(-1) (OFL). The kinetic parameters displayed that two FQs adsorption onto PZ-NZVI followed pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The thermodynamic analysis suggested the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic. In addition, the adsorption tests were executed at different influence factors and the adsorbent PZ-NZVI was suitable for a wide pH range (4-10) with the FQs (10 mg L-1) removal efficiency above 90% in 1 h. Furthermore, it was found that PZ-NZVI can be effortlessly separated from mixed solutions using external magnetic field.

Effects of fullerenes on thermal behaviors of polyethylene glycol	JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY			English	Article						fullerenes; polyethylene glycol; Py-GC/MS; thermal pyrolysis	CARBON-BLACK; POLY(ETHYLENE OXIDE); FLASH PYROLYSIS; C-60; DEGRADATION; DERIVATIVES; HYDROXYL; PRODUCTS	Effects of fullerenes including FS, EFS and pure C-60 on thermal behaviors of polyethylene glycol (PEG) have been studied by employing thermograivmetry-differential thermogravimetry (TG-DTG), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and off-line furnace-type pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The products were collected by Cambridge filter pad which was widely used in analyzing the combustion products of cigarette. The results showed that the addition of fullerenes obviously restrained the thermal decomposition of PEG. The initial decomposition temperatures (IDT) and maximum decomposition peak temperatures (MDT) were evidently postponed by the addition of fullerenes. Pyrolysis products with one or two hydroxyl end groups obviously increased with the addition of 10% C-60. The reasons of the changes were discussed from the aspects of reaction mechanisms.

For keeping soil fertility, the application of animal manure is commonly practiced in black soils. However, the impact of this application on abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in black soils of China remains unclear. Here, we surveyed the profiles of ARGs in 72 soil samples collected from four long-term experimental stations with different fertilization regimes and from open farmlands in two sites across northeast China using high-throughput quantitative PCR. Results showed that a total of 178 ARGs including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected, and the diversity and abundance of ARGs were significantly increased with manure application. Additionally, the finding of a significant positive correlation between relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs (P < 0.0001), suggesting that horizontal gene transfer may potentially impact the transmission of ARGs. Furthermore, two genes aadA-1-01 and mexF, encoding resistance to aminoglycoside and multi-drug, respectively, were recognized as indicators to estimate the abundance of other co-occurring ARGs. These findings provided insights into the soil resistome in black soils of northeast China and also highlighted the environmental risks caused by manure application should not be ignored.

Quantifying changes in water use and groundwater availability in a megacity using novel integrated systems modeling	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Systems approach; Groundwater; Sustainability; Crop model; Recharge; Land use	NORTH CHINA PLAIN; NITROGEN; SOIL; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; EFFICIENCY; CHALLENGE; RECHARGE; CARBON	Water sustainability in megacities is a growing challenge with far-reaching effects. Addressing sustainability requires an integrated, multidisciplinary approach able to capture interactions among hydrology, population growth, and socioeconomic factors and to reflect changes due to climate variability and land use. We developed a new systems modeling framework to quantify the influence of changes in land use, crop growth, and urbanization on groundwater storage for Beijing, China. This framework was then used to understand and quantify causes of observed decreases in groundwater storage from 1993 to 2006, revealing that the expansion of Beijing's urban areas at the expense of croplands has enhanced recharge while reducing water lost to evapotranspiration, partially ameliorating groundwater declines. The results demonstrate the efficacy of such a systems approach to quantify the impacts of changes in climate and land use on water sustainability for megacities, while providing a quantitative framework to improve mitigation and adaptation strategies that can help address future water challenges.

New generation geostationary satellite observations support seasonality in greenness of the Amazon evergreen forests	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DRY-SEASON; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEAF-AREA; VEGETATION; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; MODIS; REFLECTANCE; PHENOLOGY	Assessing the seasonal patterns of the Amazon rainforests has been difficult because of the paucity of ground observations and persistent cloud cover over these forests obscuring optical remote sensing observations. Here, we use data from a new generation of geostationary satellites that carry the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) to study the Amazon canopy. ABI is similar to the widely used polar orbiting sensor, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), but provides observations every 10-15min. Our analysis of NDVI data collected over the Amazon during 2018-19 shows that ABI provides 21-35 times more cloud-free observations in a month than MODIS. The analyses show statistically significant changes in seasonality over 85% of Amazon forest pixels, an area about three times greater than previously reported using MODIS data. Though additional work is needed in converting the observed changes in seasonality into meaningful changes in canopy dynamics, our results highlight the potential of the new generation geostationary satellites to help us better understand tropical ecosystems, which has been a challenge with only polar orbiting satellites. Cloud cover and scarcity of ground-based validation hinder remote sensing of forest dynamics in the Amazon basin. Here, the authors analyse imagery from a high-frequency geostationary satellite sensor to study monthly NDVI patterns in the Amazon forest, finding support for spatially extensive seasonality.

We developed state-factor models with machine learning to understand better and to predict the abundance of 10 dominant phyla and bacterial diversities in Australian soils, the latter expressed by the Chao and Shannon indices. In the models, we used proxies for the edaphic, climatic, biotic and topographic factors, which included soil properties, environmental variables, and the absorbance at visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) wavelengths. From a cross-validation with all observations (n = 681), we found that our models explained 43-73% of the variance in bacterial phyla abundance and diversity. The vis-NIR spectra, which represent the organic and mineral composition of soil, were prominent drivers of abundance and diversity in the models, as were changes in the soil-water balance, potential evapotranspiration, and soil nutrients. From independent validations, we found that spectr-otransfer functions could predict well the phyla Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria (R-2 > 0.7) as well as other dominant phyla and the Chao and Shannon diversities (R-2 > 0.5). Predictions of the phyla Firmicutes were the poorest (R-2 = 0.42). The vis-NIR spectra markedly improved the explanatory power and predictability of the models.	[Yang, Yuanyuan; Rossel, Raphael A.

The rates of litter decomposition and nutrient release of five epiphytes (macrolichens Everniastrum nepalense, Nephromopsis ornata and Usnea florida, moss Homaliodendron flabellatum, and fern Phymatopteris connexa) and two tree species (Castanopsis wattii and Lithocarpus xylocarpus) were quantified over a two-year period using litterbags in the canopy and on the forest floor in an evergreen broad-leaved forest in the subtropical Ailao Mountains in southwest China. After two years, all litter in the canopy decayed 15-30% slower than on the forest floor, with 17-69% and 2-51% of initial masses remaining respectively. Nutrient concentration varied regularly as decay proceeded in the canopy while nutrient amount underwent regular variation on the forest floor. Decay rate and nutrient release differed significantly among functional groups and the order of decay rate was lichen > tree > fern > bryophyte. Lichens had the fastest decay rates, and the fruticose U florida decayed faster than the other two foliose species. The rate of lichen decomposition was significantly correlated with morphology and initial N and P concentrations. The bryophyte species had the lowest decay rate, but with relatively rapid release of N and P, while the fern had high net N and P immobilization. K was rapidly released from litter. Ca and Mg eventually decreased with variable concentrations during decomposition. Our results highlight the potential importance of nonvascular epiphytes in increasing nutrient availability, especially N and P, in the canopy soil environment, and the probable role of epiphytic bryophytes and ferns in accumulating organic matter.

Impressively, when investigated as binder-free supercapacitor electrodes, such unique NiCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays on Ni foam exhibit a superior specific capacitance of 2193 F g(-1) and 1490 F g(-1) at current densities of 1 and 10 A g(-1) calculated based on the active mass of NiCo2O4, respectively. Furthermore, the areal capacitance is 3.71 F cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) and 1.39 F cm(-2) at 40 mA cm(-2). The remarkable electrochemical performance is due to the hierarchical nanoneedle array structure with bottom crosslinked nanosheets, which has a large surface area, thus providing more sites to facilitate electrochemical reactions, rapid ion/electron transport, and enhanced strain accommodation. Our results demonstrate that the hierarchical NiCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays are a promising material as a binder-free electrode for high performance supercapacitors.

Multiple characterization results revealed that natural hematite and natural pyrite were successfully loaded on the surface of biochars respectively. After introducing Fe and S, the removal performance of FSC was better than that of FOC and primitive biochar (BC). This was not only due to the increase of the average pore width and abundant surface functional groups, but also since that (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot - played the key role in the removal of NOR, which was confirmed by Election Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) experiments. High Resolution Mass Spectrometer (HRMS) was used to determine the transformation intermediates of NOR and the possible degradation pathways were proposed. Excellent adsorption performance and free radicals ((OH)-O-center dot and SO4(center dot -)) action made FSC had the best removal performance on NOR in this study.

Pyrosequencing Reveals Bacterial Communities in Unchlorinated Drinking Water Distribution System: An Integral Study of Bulk Water, Suspended Solids, Loose Deposits, and Pipe Wall Biofilm	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ASSIMILABLE ORGANIC-CARBON; MICROBIAL-GROWTH; FLOW VELOCITY; SOFT DEPOSITS; DIVERSITY; QUALITY; IDENTIFICATION; ACCUMULATION; RESISTANCE; PARTICLES	The current understanding of drinking water distribution system (DWDS) microbiology is limited to pipe wall biofilm and bulk water; the contributions of particle-associated bacteria (from suspended solids and loose deposits) have long been neglected. Analyzing the composition and correlation of bacterial communities from different phases helped us to locate where most of the bacteria are and understand the interactions among these phases. In the present study, the bacteria from four critical phases of an unchlorinated DWDS, including bulk water, pipe wall biofilm, suspended solids, and loose deposits, were quantified and identified by adenosine triphosphate analysis and pyrosequencing, respectively. The results showed that the bulk water bacteria (including the contribution of suspended solids) contributed less than 2% of the total bacteria. The bacteria associated with loose deposits and pipe wall biofilm that accumulated in the DWDS accounted for over 98% of the total bacteria, and the contributions of bacteria in loose deposits and pipe wall biofilm were comparable. Depending on the amount of loose deposits, its contribution can be 7-fold higher than the pipe wall biofilm. Pyrosequencing revealed relatively stable bacterial communities in bulk water, pipe wall biofilm, and suspended solids throughout the distribution system; however, the communities present in loose deposits were dependent on the amount of loose deposits locally. Bacteria within the phases of suspended solids, loose deposits, and pipe wall biofilm were similar in phylogenetic composition. The bulk water bacteria (dominated by Polaromonas spp.) were clearly different from the bacteria from the other three phases (dominated by Sphingomonas spp.). This study highlighted that the integral DWDS ecology should include contributions from all of the four phases, especially the bacteria harbored by loose deposits. The accumulation of loose deposits and the aging process create variable microenvironments inside loose deposits structures for bacteria to grow. Moreover, loose deposits protect the associated bacteria from disinfectants, and due to their mobility, the associated bacteria reach taps easily.	[Liu, G.; Li, S.; Vreeburg, J. H. G.; Verberk, J. Q.

However, the selectivity toward alcohol products has remained relatively low, due to the lack of catalysts favoring the adsorption of key intermediates in the alcohol pathways. Herein, a Cu(3)Ag(1)electrocatalyst is developed using galvanic replacement of an electrodeposited Cu matrix. The Cu(3)Ag(1)electrocatalyst enables a 63% Faradaic efficiency for CO2-to-alcohol production and an alcohol partial current density of -25 mA cm(-2)at -0.95 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding to a 126-fold enhancement in selectivity and 25-fold increase in activity compared to the bare electrodeposited Cu matrix. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the interphase electron transfer from Cu to Ag generates electron-deficient Cu sites and favors the adsorption of CO(2)reduction intermediates in the alcohol pathway, such as CH3CHO* and CH3CH2O*. Thus, for this electron-deficient catalyst, the C2H5OH pathway is more preferable than the ethylene (C2H4) pathway, endowing the catalyst with an alcohol/ethylene ratio of 38:1. These findings suggest both experimental approaches and theoretical insights for exploring highly selective CO2-to-alcohol conversion.

The diurnal variation of seawater pCO(2) ranges from 264 to 579 mu atm in summer, which is much larger than that in autumn (152-335 mu atm), in winter (84-260 mu atm), and in spring (114-228 mu atm). The sea-air CO2 flux in summer (similar to 9.6 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) is also larger than that in other seasons (i.e.,similar to 3 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in spring, similar to 3.5 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in autumn, and similar to 2.7 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) in winter). The atmospheric pCO(2) in this reef shows small diurnal and seasonal variations. The integration of the time-series pCO(2) data shows that the reef area is a weak source of atmospheric CO2 at similar to 0.54 mol CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). Further analyses indicate that the seasonal variations of the surface seawater pCO(2) in Luhuitou fringing reef are mainly affected by seasonally-dependent biological metabolic processes (organic processe and inorganic process), and that the organic process play a more important role than the inorganic process. Seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) variations and hydrodynamic processes may also have some influence on seawater pCO(2) variation.

However, the socio-economic effects are not considered due to the lack of detailed information about this. Here we used a well-validated remote sensing model and multiple socio-economic factors to investigate the driving factors of ET changes over the Loess Plateau during 1982-2012. Results showed that the modeled annual ET significantly increased by similar to 2 mm yr(-2) during this period (p < 0.001), caused by increased transpiration (2.16 mm yr(-2)) and interception (0.27 mm yr(-2)), which was partly offset by decreased soil evaporation (-0.47 mm yr(-2)). Meanwhile, although the average ET of the forest was larger (480.4 +/- 14.8 mm yr(-1)), it was found that the change in total ET of the region was dominated by that in grassland and cropland (1.1 km(3) yr(-2), 90% altogether). Factorial simulations indicated that the intensifying ET over 79.4% and 9.1% of the study area can be explained by vegetation greening and climate change, respectively. Further analysis suggested that the vegetation greening and the increased ET were primarily associated with the rapid urbanization and agricultural intensification.

The central sensing device was a hybrid structure of nanohole array and gold nanoparticles, which demonstrated good conductivity and high localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensitivity. By utilizing such specially-designed nanoplasmonic sensor as working electrode, both electrical and spectral responses on the surface of the sensor could be simultaneously detected during the electrochemical process. Cyclic voltammetry was implemented to activate the oxidation and recovery of dopamine and serotonin, while transmission spectrum measurement was carried out to synchronously record to LSPR responses of the nanoplasmonic sensor. Coupling with electrochemistry, LSPR results indicated good integrity and linearity, along with promising accuracy in qualitative and quantitative detection even for mixed solution and in brain tissue homogenates. Also, the detection results of other negatively-charged neurotransmitters like acetylcholine demonstrated the selectivity of our detection method for transmitters with positive charge. When compared with traditional electrochemical signals, LSPR signals provided better signal-to-noise ratio and lower detection limits, along with immunity against interference factors like ascorbic acid. Taking the advantages of such robustness, the coupled detection method was proved to be a promising platform for point-of-care testing for neurotransmitters.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the advancements, it still suffers from sluggish interfacial charge transport kinetics and scarcity of strategies to finely modulate charge transport pathways. Herein, this article demonstrates the unexpected charge modulation property of non-conjugated insulating polymer assisted by a universal layer-by-layer self-assembly tactic. Oppositely charged poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA) and Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots (MQDs) are periodically attached to the wide bandgap metal oxides (WMOs) to design multilayered heterostructured photoanodes. The intermediate PDDA layer acts as an efficacious charge relay medium to access directional electron flow from WMOs to Ti3C2 MQDs, while Ti3C2 MQDs serve as the electron extractor. Charge transfer cascade is thus stimulated on account of the simultaneous electron-trapping capabilities of interim PDDA layer and Ti3C2 MQDs, which synergistically favors the conspicuously boosted charge separation over WMOs, affording the WMOs/(PDDA/MQDs)(n) photoanodes with considerably enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performances. Moreover, PEC performances of such photoanodes can be tuned by interface configuration via assembly number and sequence. This work will provide an insightful perspective to craft a directional charge transfer pathway through insulating polymer for solar energy conversion.

These assays may allow better clinical decision and more efficient use of health systems. It is reported that aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) are observed in gastric cancer blood plasma and these miRNAs might serve as early detection biomarkers for this malignancy. Current methodological approaches for miRNAs analysis are not satisfactory and suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor sensitivity and laborious handling procedures. In this study, an integrated protocol based on magnetic beads (MBs) and chemiluminescence (CL) technique was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of miRNAs from gastric cancer plasma. Factors that may influence the chemiluminescent signal were also systematically investigated and optimized. This technique revealed an ultralow limit of detection of 0.1 pM, at extraordinarily wide range of six orders of magnitudes. Moreover, the avoidance of potential bias in the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that may influence the accuracy makes this method suitable and effective for biomarkers detection.

Evaluation of Simulated CO2 Concentrations from the CarbonTracker-Asia Model Using In-situ Observations over East Asia for 2009-2013	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						model evaluation; in-situ observations; CarbonTracker; East Asia	4 WMO/GAW STATIONS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ERROR CHARACTERIZATION; TRANSPORT MODELS; TALL TOWERS; FLUXES	The CarbonTracker (CT) model has been used in previous studies for understanding and predicting the sources, sinks, and dynamics that govern the distribution of atmospheric CO2 at varying ranges of spatial and temporal scales. However, there are still challenges for reproducing accurate model-simulated CO2 concentrations close to the surface, typically associated with high spatial heterogeneity and land cover. In the present study, we evaluated the performance of nested-grid CT model simulations of CO2 based on the CT2016 version through comparison with in-situ observations over East Asia covering the period 2009-13. We selected sites located in coastal, remote, inland, and mountain areas. The results are presented at diurnal and seasonal time periods. At target stations, model agreement with in-situ observations was varied in capturing the diurnal cycle. Overall, biases were less than 6.3 ppm on an all-hourly mean basis, and this was further reduced to a maximum of 4.6 ppm when considering only the daytime. For instance, at Anmyeondo, a small bias was obtained in winter, on the order of 0.2 ppm. The model revealed a diurnal amplitude of CO2 that was nearly flat in winter at Gosan and Anmyeondo stations, while slightly overestimated in the summertime. The model's performance in reproducing the diurnal cycle remains a challenge and requires improvement. The model showed better agreement with the observations in capturing the seasonal variations of CO2 during daytime at most sites, with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.70 to 0.99. Also, model biases were within -0.3 and 1.3 ppm, except for inland stations (7.7 ppm).

Though having the merits of high earth abundance, easy availability, and tunable composition, transition-metal oxides are usually deemed as poor electrocatalysts for HER. Herein, we demonstrate that doping beta-CoMoO4 nanoplates with phosphorus can turn them into active electrocatalysts for HER Theoretical calculation and experimental studies unravel that enhanced electrical conductivity and optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy are major causes for the improvement of intrinsic activity. As a result, only an overpotential of 138 mV is required to drive hydrogen evolving at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH for P-doped beta-CoMoO4, which outstrips many recently reported transition-metal oxides and is just slightly inferior to commercial Pt/C. This work opens a new route to tune the HER performance of transition-metal oxides.

Herein, a phosphorus (P) vapor assisted synthetic strategy was employed to fabricate the P-doped hollow g-C3N4 photocatalysts with ultrathin shell structure (< 25 nm in thickness). The doping of P and the compression of shell thickness of the hollow g-C3N4 were induced simultaneously by the P vapor during the heating process. The as-prepared P-doped ultrathin hollow g-C3N4 sphere (P/UH-CNS) photocatalysts exhibited enlarged surface area and light responsive range, and improved charge transportation efficiency by suppressing the charge recombination and self-trapping within g-C3N4.

These (salen)(TiCl2)-Cl-IV complexes are structurally different from the typical (salen)(MCl)-Cl-III complexes (M = Al, Co and Cr), in which two Cl- groups and no vacant coordination site exist in the axial positions. In the presence of bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride (PPNCl), these (salen)(TiCl2)-Cl-IV complexes could effectively catalyze the ROAC of phthalate anhydrides (PA) and cyclohexene oxide (CHO), affording perfectly alternating polyester. The Lewis acidity of Ti-IV complexes and structures of cocatalyst affected significantly the catalytic activities. Chain initiation investigation indicated that the copolymerization was initiated by the axial Cl- group in (salen)(TiCl2)-Cl-IV complex rather than the nucleophile in the cocatalyst, which is very different from the mechanism proposed for ROAC catalyzed by (salen)(AlCl)-Cl-III/PPNCl binary system. Meanwhile, (salen)(TiCl2)-Cl-IV /PPNCl system exhibited broad monomer adaptability, allowing for the preparation of polyesters with structural diversity via copolymerization of some common cyclic anhydrides and epoxides. Our present work demonstrated a rare example of cyclic anhydride/epoxide copolymerization catalyzed by (salen)(TiCl2)-Cl-IV complex.

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The precise mechanism responsible for the sex difference needs to be determined. Female and male mice were given ethanol by intragastric infusion every day for 4 weeks. The pathological changes were detected by hematoxylin-eosin, Sirius red, oil red O, periodic acid-Schiff, and Hochest33258 staining in the liver of female and male mice. The related gene and protein expression of hepatocytes stress, proliferation and apoptosis, glycogen synthesis, lipid metabolism, and hepatic fibrosis were also systematically analyzed in the female and male mice. Livers from ethanol-treated female mice had more serious hepatocyte necrosis, liver fibrosis (P < 0.01), substantial micro/macrovesicular steatosis (p < 0.01), glycogen consumption (p < 0.05), and hepatocytes apoptosis (p < 0.05) than ethanol-treated male mice. The expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), HSP70, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), and phosphorylated signal transducer and activators of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) was higher in ethanol-treated male mice than ethanol-treated female mice (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). But, the expression of Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein), Caspase 3, CYP2E1 (cytochrome P4502E1), and transforming growth factor beta l had the contrary results. Our study suggested that ethanol treatment induced more expression of HSP27 and HSP70, faster hepatocyte proliferation, higher level of glycogen, and interleukin-6 signaling pathway activation, but less hepatocyte apoptosis and CYP2E1 expression in male mice than female mice, which could be helpful to understand the molecular mechanism for the influence of sex difference on alcoholic liver injury.

Herein, effective CO2 photoconversion to CH4 with high selectivity up to 96.7% is achieved over oxygen-deficient Bi-2 MoO6 under visible-light. Various characterizations and DFT calculations indicated that well-designed oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the {001} surface of Bi2MoO6 can not only enhance light harvesting and e(-)/h(+) separation, but favor CO2 adsorption in a special bidentate carbonate mode, which thermodynamically supports the further hydrogenation of intermediate *CO to generate CH4. Based on the in-situ infrared spectroscopy analysis, the CO2 adsorption modes and reaction intermediates of two pathways over Bi2MoO6 with or without OVs were figured out. The reasonable photocatalytic mechanism for highly selective conversion to CH4 was also proposed. This work provides new insights to the role of OVs in selective CO2 photoconversion, and paves ways to design efficient CH4 evolution systems.

Fiber reinforcement polymer (FRP) bars are being considered as a replacement for steel rebars to prevent corrosion. However, the effects of saline environments and alkaline cementitious conditions on the impact performance of FRP bars are not well known. Therefore, this study aims at examining the low-velocity impact performance of basalt FRP (BFRP) bars after exposure to the saline-alkaline environment for 24, 48, and 72 days and elevated temperatures (25, 40, and 55 degrees C). The maximum load-bearing capacity, deformation capacity, and energy absorption capacity of the deteriorated BFRP bars are measured. Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to study the deterioration mechanism further. It was revealed that both the fracture threshold and the bending stiffness of BFRP bars generally decrease with the elevated exposure temperature and duration. The findings also suggest that deterioration of BFRP bars in a natural saline-alkaline environment is less severe than the simulated saline-alkaline solution. This study provides some insights to promote the application of FRP composites in coastal and marine structures in a saline-alkaline environment with low-velocity impact loads.

As an ideal model system, novel nano composite superalloy/graphite FeNi3@C nanocapsules were synthesized that showed two significant advantages including extremely stable magnetic behavior from 5 K to 300 K and strong anti-oxidation ability up to 719 K, simultaneously. The tuning regularity of enhanced EMW absorption, including magnetic core, filling ratio, dielectric shell, was systemically investigated. A reflection loss (RL) -47.26 dB at 13 GHz and an absorption bandwidth 7.04 GHz (RL <-10 dB) with absorber thicknesses 3 mm were obtained while the effective absorbing bandwidth remained at top level in magnetic nanocapsules system. This work not only extends EMW absorption application of magnetic nanocapsules in wide temperature range, but also provides a clear optimal sequence to support the material design strategy to achieve best EMW absorption in nanocomposite systems.

Flow enhancements of water-based nanoparticle dispersions through microscale porous media are investigated through twelve hydrophilic sedimentary rocks with pore-throat radius between 1.2 and 10 mm, which are quantitatively explained with a simple model with slip length correction for Darcy flow. Both as wetting phase, water exhibited no-slip Darcy flow in all cores; however, flow enhancement of nanoparticle dispersions can be up to 5.7 times larger than that of water, and it increases with the decreasing of pore-throat radius. The experimental data reveals characteristic slip lengths are of order 500 and 1000 nm for 3M (R) and HNPs-1 nanoparticles, respectively, independent of the lithology or nanoparticle concentration or shear rate. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of flow degradation is observed for HNPs-2 nanoparticles. These results explore the feasible application of using nanoparticle dispersions to control flow at the microscale.

Results from the bench-scale experiments showed that the commercial hydroponic nutrient solution (i.e. solution containing water and essential nutrients) exhibited similar performance (i.e., water flux and reverse salt flux) to other inorganic draw solutions when treating synthetic wastewater. The use of hydroponic solution is highly advantageous since it provides all the required macro- (i.e., N, P and K) and micronutrients (i.e., Ca, Mg, S, Mn, B, Zn and Mo) in a single balanced solution and can therefore be used directly after dilution without the need to add any elements. After long-term operation (i.e. up to 75% water recovery), different physical cleaning methods were tested and results showed that hydraulic flushing can effectively restore up to 75% of the initial water flux while osmotic backwashing was able to restore the initial water flux by more than 95%; illustrating the low-fouling potential of the FDFO process. Pilot-scale studies demonstrated that the FDFO process is able to produce the required nutrient concentration and final water quality (i.e., pH and conductivity) suitable for hydroponic applications. Coupling FDFO with pressure assisted osmosis (PAO) in the later stages could help in saving operational costs (i.e., energy and membrane replacement costs). Finally, the test application of nutrient solution produced by the pilot FDFO process to hydroponic lettuce showed similar growth pattern as the control without any signs of nutrient deficiency.

Transformation-induced strain of a low transformation temperature alloy with high hardness during laser metal deposition	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES			English	Article						Laser metal deposition; Residual stress; Phase transformation; Phase transition temperature; High hardness	WELDING RESIDUAL-STRESS; CHARACTERIZING PHASE-TRANSFORMATIONS; INDUCED PLASTICITY; TOOL STEEL; MARTENSITIC-TRANSFORMATION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MATERIALS LTT; CARBON-STEEL; PART 2; MICROSTRUCTURE	Bulk crack-free Fe-Cr-Ni-Mo-Si-B alloy (with high hardness of 54.5 HRC) was fabricated via laser metal deposition (LMD). The solid-state phase transformation (PT) volume effect, transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), and the influences of PT strain on the tensile properties of Fe-Cr-Ni-Mo-Si-B alloy were investigated, and the problem of how to release thermal contraction through PT strain in the LMD process was discussed. The results show that the volume strain of the martensite PT of Fe-Cr-Ni-Mo-Si-B alloy was equivalent to the thermal contraction strain caused by a temperature decrease of about 370 degrees C for the austenite of this alloy, and the PT volume expansion effect increased with a decrease in transformation temperature. In the LMD process, the Magee effect had an obvious contribution on the TRIP, but the decrease of tensile stress during the actual PT process must be considered. Under constant load conditions close to the yield strength, the strain of TRIP should be an order of magnitude higher than that of the transition volume effect. In situ neutron diffraction demonstrated that the martensite starting point (M-s) of PT can be significantly increased by stress and plastic. The highest martensite starting temperature of strain induced PT (M-d) is about 360 degrees C higher than that of PT without external stress. PT strain can endow the materials, which are completely brittle at room temperature, with an elongation up to 34% in the tensile process. Thermal contraction strain the LMD process can be counteracted by PT strain, thus achieving the crack-free formation of high-hardness materials.	[Fang, J.

However, unsatisfactory uptake capacities over heavy metal ions limit their practical applications. Herein, we have synthesized a novel hierarchical meso/macroporous BN fibers (MBNFs) via a simple carbothermal reduction method using luffa sponge as a template. The as-obtained MBNFs comprise densely arranged parallel macrochannels on a micrometer scale, with mesopores on the surface of the channel. The resulting MBNFs exhibited remarkable adsorption performance for different heavy metal ions including Cd2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, and Pb2+ with maximum uptake capacities as high as 2989, 1885, 723, and 453 mg/g, respectively. In particular, the adsorption capacity for Cd2+ and Zn2+ exceed the highest values reported for BN materials. In addition, the MBNFs showed excellent stability to re-use for a few times. The present MBNFs materials prepared using cheap and earth abundant luffa sponge may find broad applications such as adsorbent for environmental remediation applications.

This study examines the effects of a typical agricultural fire event (8-13 June 2012) on ozone photochemistry over the Yangtze River Delta region, East China. The online coupled Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry model is used, with the inclusion of a detailed agricultural fire emission inventory and seven heterogeneous reactions on soot surfaces. Comparisons with satellite and ground observational data indicate that the model is capable of reproducing the transport and evolution of this crop fire event. The precursor emissions from agricultural fires play a major role in modifying ozone photochemistry, with a maximal increase in ozone mixing ratio reaching 20ppb (40%) near the fire zones in northern Anhui. The radiation feedback generates a small increase of surface NO2 levels by 2% and a decrease in surface O-3 levels by 1% in the smoke plume. The effects due to heterogeneous uptake on soot are rather small, on average, changing the average O-3, NO2, OH, and HO2 concentrations by +0.8%, -0.5%, -0.7%, and +0.8%, respectively. This study highlights the complicated interactions between agricultural fire emissions and photochemistry.

Effect of application of iron (Fe) and alpha-ketoglutaric acid on growth photosynthesis, and Fe content in fragrant rice seedlings	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						net photosynthetic rate; plant mass; root morphological characteristics; seedling height	SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; FOLIAR APPLICATION; MINERAL NUTRIENTS; ACCUMULATION; CADMIUM; NITROGEN; YIELD; 2-ACETYL-1-PYRROLINE; HOMEOSTASIS; TOLERANCE	At a three-leaf stage, two Fe treatments [0 mg kg(-1) (Fe-) and 20 mg.kg(-1) (Fe+) in the form of FeCl3] were used in the soil of the pot and then two concentrations of alpha-lcetoglutaric acid [0 mg L-1 (A-) and 50 mg L-1 (A+)] were sprayed to the rice plants of Meixiangzhan and Yuxiangyouzhan cultivars. We showed that seedlings exhibited an increased length and fresh and thy mass of shoots and roots with treatments Fe+A- and Fe-A+, as well as the Fe content increased greatly. Both treatments increased the morphological characteristic values of roots and promoted photosynthesis. Interestingly, Fe+A+ notably affected the photosynthesis of fragrant rice seedlings; however, it exerted no significant differences on other parameters. Overall, Fe and alpha-ketoglutaric acid had the potential for improving the growth of fragrant rice seedlings. The interaction between Fe and alpha-ketoglutaric acid regulated photosynthesis in seedling leaves, which provided evidence for further improvement of rice cultivation.	[Cheng, S. R.; LI, S.

In this study, the electrospinning method is employed to synthesize one-dimensional (1D) Fe2TiO5 nanochains. The as-prepared Fe2TiO5 nanochains exhibited superior specific capacity (500 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.10 A center dot g(-1)), excellent rate performance (180 mAh center dot g(-1) at 5.00 A center dot g(-1)), and good cycling stability (retaining 100% of the initial specific capacity at a current density of 1.00 A center dot g(-1) after 1000 cycles). The as-assembled Fe2TiO5/SCCB lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) also delivered a competitive energy density (137.8 Wh center dot kg(-1)) and power density (11,250 W center dot kg(-1)). This study proves that the as-fabricated 1D Fe2TiO5 nanochains are promising anode materials for high-performance LICs.

Two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors, with an atomic thickness that allows superior gate-field penetration, are of interest as channel materials for future transistors(2,3). However, the integration of high-dielectric-constant (kappa) materials with 2D materials, while scaling their capacitance equivalent thickness (CET), has proved challenging. Here we explore transferrable ultrahigh-kappa single-crystalline perovskite strontium-titanium-oxide membranes as a gate dielectric for 2D field-effect transistors. Our perovskite membranes exhibit a desirable sub-one-nanometre CET with a low leakage current (lessthan10(-2) amperes per square centimetre at 2.5 megavolts per centimetre). We find that the van der Waalsgap between strontium-titanium-oxide dielectrics and 2D semiconductors mitigates the unfavourable fringing-induced barrier-lowering effect resulting from the use of ultrahigh-kappa dielectrics(4). Typical short-channel transistors made of scalable molybdenum-disulfide films by chemical vapour deposition and strontium-titanium-oxide dielectrics exhibit steep subthreshold swings down to about 70 millivolts per decade and on/off current ratios up to 10(7), which matchesthe low-power specifications suggested by the latest International Roadmap for Devices and Systems(5).

In general, pure organic or inorganic materials are applied into the interlayers, but organic-inorganic hybrid materials have been rarely reported for this application. In this work, we report using the first titanium-oxo cluster-based organic-inorganic hybrid as the interlayer material by introducing large it-conjugated benzo[ghi]perylenetriimides as an organic part via a simple ligand-exchange reaction. This new hybrid material showed excellent solubility, well-aligned energy levels, and excellent electron mobilities, enabling its great potential application as an interlayer in solar cells such as perovskite and organic solar cells, providing high power conversion efficiencies of >20% and 16%, respectively. Therefore, we claim that our present work introduces a new class of cluster-based organic-inorganic hybrid interlayer materials that exhibit promising application in organic electronics. [GRAPHICS] .

The MIL-53-PVDF MMM was well characterized and major factors influencing DME performances were systematically investigated including membrane type, MOF dosage, eluent type, solution pH, extraction/elution time and salinity, etc. Under optimal conditions, the MIL-53-PVDF MMM based DME coupled with HPLC exhibited excellent linearity within 0.03-10 mu g L-1 for chlorimuronethyl and 0.01-10 mu g L-1 for other six SUs individual. High enrichment factor of 250 was obtained, as well as low detection limits and quantification limits ranged from 3.75 to 10.30 ng L-1 and 12.49-34.30 ng L-1, respectively. Furthermore, the method attained high recoveries of 77.20-111.00% at three spiking levels of SUs, with relative standard deviations of 1.28-14.67% in tap water, seawater and surface water samples. Additionally, the MMM was readily separated from water and well regenerated, and could keep about 80% recovery after 25 cycles. Compared to that reported extraction materials, the MIL-53-PVDF MMM possessed the advantages of high enrichment ability, excellent reusability, good practicality and easy separation, indicating it was a promising alternative for the enrichment of SUs from aqueous environments.

Herein, binary LaCoO3/g-C3N4 hybrids consisting of LaCoO3 co-catalysts in-situ growth on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets were constructed via a facile mixed-calcination process and utilized for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution at room temperature under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). As expected, all the LaCoO3/g-C3N4 hybrids illustrated dramatically ameliorated photocatalytic efficiencies compared to the pristine g-C3N4. More importantly, the optimal photodegradation rate constant of LaCoO3(3.0 wt%)/g-C3N4 reached about 0.00346 min(-1), which was almost 3.2 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 for MO degradation, which could be originate from the function of LaCoO3 co-catalysts acted as excellent electron collectors for capturing the electrons generated by g-C3N4, effectively suppressed the photogenerated charge carriers recombination and prolonged the lifetime of the separated electron-hole pairs. Additionally, radical trapping experiments confirmed that the photogenerated holes and superoxide radicals were responsible for the MO decomposition. Ultimately, a plausible photodegradation mechanism was also proposed. This work could bring new opportunity for the rational construction of highly efficient noble metal-free co-catalysts with enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 for applying in environmental remediation and energy conversion.

Here, we report on a bifunctional catalyst based on Ir-doped NiV layered double hydroxide with Ir-O-V catalytic groups on which water dissociation, HER, and OER occur on Ir, bridge O, and V atoms, respectively. Interestingly, the dopant Ir ions were found to play a triple role: (i) serve as catalytic sites for water dissociation, (ii) reduce charge density on adjacent bridge oxygen, thus facilitating HER there, and (iii) increase charge density on V ions, which in turn boosts OER. As a result, the catalyst achieves an ultralow applied voltage for overall water splitting (1.49 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and beats the noble metallic couple Pt/C and Ir/C with its value of 1.60 V @ 10 mA cm(-2).

Particles, which are dominated by fine aerosols, are relatively scattering. And most of their optical properties have similar variations to the aerosol concentrations. Results also show that the west YRD could still suffer severe air pollution, although the seasonal mean aerosol concentrations have decreased in recent years. Even in cold seasons, O-3 could exceed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for about 40 days during the sampling period. Most of polluted episodes are caused by local and subregional emissions. A case study for a typical O-3 and PM2.5 episode in December 2016 demonstrates that the episode was generally associated with regional transport and a stable weather system. Air pollutants were mostly transported from the western areas with high emissions, as well as with an anticyclone and high-pressure system in this region. Correlation analysis reveals that the interactions between O-3 and PM are complex, with a combination of inhibition and promotion under different conditions. The inhibition effect might result from the reduction of photolysis frequency near the surface due to aerosols in addition to their positive correlations with precursors, while the promotion effect is from the formation of secondary aerosols under high concentrations of oxidants and solar radiation. However, the interaction between O-3 and BC shows an inhibiting effect due to its chemical stability. This also indicated a VOC-sensitive regime for photochemical production of O-3 in this region. This study further improves insight into the characteristics and interactions of main pollutants and may contribute to the improvement of the simulation and prediction of aerosols and gases in the urban area of the YRD.

This highlights the need for rapid, sensitive, and selective methods to detect pathogens in food products. In this study, a magnetic nanoparticles enhanced oligonucleotide microarray assay was developed for rapid and sensitive identification of Escherichia coli O157: H7, Salmonella enterica, Vibrio cholerae and Campylobacter jejuni in food. Biotin labeled forward primer and Cy3 labeled reverse primer were used for exponential PCR amplification. Magnetic nanoparticles with covalently attached streptavidin were then used to capture the PCR products. After denaturation at 95 degrees C and magnetic separation, the Cy3-labeled target strand was collected and concentrated in the supernatant for hybridization. By using streptavidin-modified magnetic nanoparticles (SA-MNPs) for rapid generation of purified single stranded DNA target, we successfully increased hybridization signal and improved sensitivity for pathogen detection on DNA microarray. In comparison with the conventional single stranded target preparation methods, this magnetic nanoparticles based method yielded up to 15-fold increase in the hybridization signal and achieved 1 similar to 2 orders of magnitude enhancement on limit of detection. The assay sensitivity for identification of Salmonella enterica in ground chicken sample was 200 cells/g of food without a pre-enrichment, and the sensitivity was increased 100-fold (similar to 2 cells/g) following 5 hr pre-enrichment at 37 degrees C. The results indicate that the magnetic nanoparticles enhanced microarray method has great potential for detection of food-borne pathogens in food samples with both high specificity and high sensitivity.

In this study, the association between weekly average concentration of air pollutants and preterm birth (PTB) was conducted in Xuzhou, a heavy industry city, in China. We constructed a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM), an ecological study, to access the associations between ambient air pollutants and PTB in this study. Totally, 5408 premature babies were included, and the weekly average levels of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O-3, and CO were 61.24, 110.21, 22.55, 40.55, 104.45, and 1.04 mg/m(3), respectively. We found that PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 significantly increased the risk of PTB, and the susceptibility windows of these contaminants were the second trimester and third trimester (from 12 to 29 weeks). Every 10 mu g/m(3) increase of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2, the greatest relative risk (RR) values and 95% confidence interval (CI) on PTB were 1.0075 [95% CI, 1.0019-1.0131], 1.0053 [95% CI, 1.0014-1.0092], 1.0203 [95% CI, 1.0030-1.0379], and 1.0170 [95% CI, 1.0052-1.0289] in lag 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th gestational weeks, respectively. No significant influence of O-3 and CO were found on preterm birth. Subgroup analysis showed that the risk of premature delivery was higher for younger pregnant women and in warm season. This finding shows that prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants is associated with preterm birth, and there existed an exposure window period.

Herein, magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (M-MSNs) were designed and synthesized, then the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and antitumor drug doxorubicin (Dox) were adsorbed onto the M-MSNs. Biocompatible alginate/chitosan polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) were assembled on the M-MSNs to achieve a pH-responsive drug delivery system and adsorb P-gp shRNA for reversing the multidrug resistance. The obtained M-MSN(Dox/Ce6)/PEM/ P-gp shRNA nanocomposites were characterized using TEM, SEM, X-ray diffraction, BET, FTIR and electrophoresis. The nanocomposites with average diameter of 280 nm exhibited a pH-responsive drug release profile, and more singlet oxygen generation in cancer cells after laser illumination. CCK-8 assay and calcein-AM/PI co-staining showed that the multifunctional nanocomplexes significantly increased cell apoptosis in vitro. With tumor-bearing Balb/c mice employed as the animal model, combined photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy was carried out, also achieving synergistic anti-tumor effects in vivo. The cores of bifunctional Fe3O4-Au nanoparticles in the multifunctional nanocomposites enabled dual-modal MR and CT imaging, which illustrated strong tumor uptake of these nanocomposites after intravenous injection into tumor-bearing mice. This work highlights the great potential of magnetic mesoporous silica nanocomposites as a multifunctional delivery platform, which is promising for imaging-guided cancer combination therapy with high efficacy.

In agricultural watershed, artificial ponds play an essential role in reducing nitrogen pollution. However, until now artificial ponds remain the least investigated part of water environments. The importance of microbial activities has seldom been discussed, which makes the microbial pathways and processes rates in nitrogen removal poorly understood. To illustrate the role of artificial ponds in microbial nitrogen removal in agricultural watersheds, 21 pond sediments and 11 soils are collected in an agricultural watershed of China. Results show that surface sediments in ponds carry significantly higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen (9.1-21.9 mg/kg) and total organic matter (64.8-113.0 g/kg) compared to the surrounding agricultural soils. High rates of microbial nitrogen removal in ponds (12.4-25.5 nmol N g(-1) h(-1)) are observed, which are 2-9 times higher than those in dryland soils. In pond sediments, denitrification dominates (> 90% N-loss) the microbial nitrogen removal process with only a minor contribution of anaerobic ammonium oxidation. A high potential of N2O production (up to 9.4 nmol N g(-1) h(-1)) occurs in ponds along with the rapid nitrogen removal. For denitrifier genes, nir gene are always more abundant than nosZ gene. Additionally, the nirS gene is more abundant under flooded conditions, while nirK gene prefers higher dissolved oxygen and NO3- in drylands. These findings highlight the ecosystem function of ponds in agricultural watersheds, and provide new ideas on pollution control and global nitrogen cycling.

The unique morphology can provide an increased electrode-electrolyte contact area and better strain accommodation; also the topotactic intercalation method can improve structure integrity and robustness. The assynthesized material delivers a capacity of 172.5 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), shows excellent cyclability with a capacity fading of only 0.0138% per cycle at 1 A g(-1) for 1000 cycles, and high rate capability as a sodiumion battery cathode. We propose that the novel morphology as well as intrinsically advantageous structural features can synergistically facilitate the kinetics and stability, resulting in superior electrochemical performance.

Biogenic oxidized organic functional groups in aerosol particles from a mountain forest site and their similarities to laboratory chamber products	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							POSITIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; PHASE OXIDATION-PRODUCTS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; HIGH-RESOLUTION; BLACK CARBON; ASIAN DUST; SECONDARY; MASS; PHOTOOXIDATION; IDENTIFICATION	Submicron particles collected at Whistler, British Columbia, at 1020 m a.s.l. during May and June 2008 on Teflon filters were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques for organic functional groups (OFG) and elemental composition. Organic mass (OM) concentrations ranged from less than 0.5 to 3.1 mu g m(-3), with a project mean and standard deviation of 1.3 +/- 1.0 mu g m(-3) and 0.21 +/- 0.16 mu g m(-3) for OM and sulfate, respectively. On average, organic hydroxyl, alkane, and carboxylic acid groups represented 34%, 33%, and 23% of OM, respectively. Ketone, amine and organosulfate groups constituted 6%, 5%, and <1% of the average organic aerosol composition, respectively. Measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC), including isoprene and monoterpenes from biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions and their oxidation products (methyl-vinylketone/methacrolein, MVK/MACR), were made using co-located proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). We present chemically-specific evidence of OFG associated with BVOC emissions. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis attributed 65% of the campaign OM to biogenic sources, based on the correlations of one factor to monoterpenes and MVK/MACR. The remaining fraction was attributed to anthropogenic sources based on a correlation to sulfate. The functional group composition of the biogenic factor (consisting of 32% alkane, 25% carboxylic acid, 21% organic hydroxyl, 16% ketone, and 6% amine groups) was similar to that of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) reported from the oxidation of BVOCs in laboratory chamber studies, providing evidence that the magnitude and chemical composition of biogenic SOA simulated in the laboratory is similar to that found in actual atmospheric conditions. The biogenic factor OM is also correlated to dust elements, indicating that dust may act as a non-acidic SOA sink. This role is supported by the organic functional group composition and morphology of single particles, which were analyzed by scanning transmission X-ray microscopy near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (STXM-NEXAFS).

Grand challenges remain in the characterization of structure, composition, and chemical state, both microscopically and spectroscopically, and complete theoretical calculations are limited when it comes to describing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst over the diverse range of structures that emerge under realistic conditions. Here a series of inverse model catalysts of ZnO on copper hydroxide were prepared where the size of ZnO was precisely tuned from atomically dispersed species to nanoparticles using atomic layer deposition. ZnO decoration boosted methanol formation to a rate of 877 g(MeOH) kg(cat)(-1) h(-1) with approximate to 80 % selectivity at 493 K. High pressure in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the atomically dispersed ZnO species are prone to aggregate at oxygen-deficient ZnO ensembles instead of forming CuZn metal alloys. By modeling various potential active structures, density functional theory calculations and microkinetic simulations revealed that ZnO/Cu interfaces with oxygen vacancies, rather than stoichiometric interfaces, Cu and CuZn alloys were essential to catalytic activation.

Previous researches have indicated that introducing a TiSi2 buffer with high conductivity to form Si/TiSi2 composites can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of Si anode. However, the facile and low-cost synthesis of Si/TiSi2 composites remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel approach to preparing Si/TiSi2 composites as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries by coupling photovoltaic (PV) silicon waste (simulated using inexpensive low-purity Si (98.8%) in experiments) and metallurgical waste (Ti-bearing blast furnace slag, TBBFS) via a new method combining induction melting and mechanical ball milling. A series of Si/TiSi2 materials were obtained using different ratios of raw materials and investigated using SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and electrochemical performance tests. The results show that TiSi2 not only acts as a buffer for the bulk expansion of Si, but also improves the electrical conductivity; therefore, the Si/TiSi2 materials exhibit enhanced cycling stability when more TiSi2 is introduced. The sample prepared using a low-purity Si and TBBFS with a mass ratio of 1:3 delivered a reversible capacity of 530 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at a charge-discharge current density of 800 mA g(-1). This work not only provides a new strategy and technology for introducing TiSi2 into Si-based anode materials, but also provides a green and sustainable technical route for the high value-added recycling of Ti-bearing blast furnace slag.

In this study, the observed near-surface aerosol optical properties in urban Nanjing are analysed from March 2014 to February 2016. Results show that near-surface urban aerosols in Nanjing are mainly from local emissions and the surrounding regions. They have lower loadings but are more scattering than aerosols in most cities in China. The annual mean aerosol extinction coefficient (EC), single-scattering albedo (SSA) and asymmetry parameter (ASP) at 550 nm are 381.96 Mm(-1), 0.9 and 0.57, respectively. The aerosol absorption coefficient (AAC) is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than its scattering coefficient (SC). However, the absorbing aerosol has a larger Angstrom exponent (AAE) value, 1.58 at 470/660 nm, about 0.2 larger than the scattering aerosols (SAE). All the aerosol optical properties follow a near-unimodal pattern, and their values are mostly concentrated around their averages, accounting for more than 60% of the total samplings. Additionally, they have substantial seasonality and diurnal variations. High levels of SC and AAC all appear in winter due to higher aerosol and trace gas emissions. AAE (ASP) is the smallest (largest) in summer, possibly because of high relative humidity (RH) which also causes considerably larger SC and smaller SAE, although intensive gas-to-particle transformation could produce a large number of finer scattering aerosols in this season. Seasonality of EC is different from the columnar aerosol optical depth. Larger AACs appear during the rush hours of the day while SC and back-scattering coefficient (Bsp) only peak in the early morning. Aerosols are fresher in the daytime than at night-time, leading to their larger Angstrom exponent and smaller ASP. Different temporal variations between AAC and SC cause the aerosols to be more absorbing (smaller SSA) in autumn, winter and around rush hours. ASP has a good quasi-log-normal growth trend with increasing SC when RH is below 60 %. The correlation between AAC and SC at the site is close but a little smaller than that in suburban Nanjing in spring. Atmospheric visibility decreases exponentially with increasing EC or SC, more sharply in spring and summer, and it could be further deteriorated with increasing SSA and ASP.

Ecogeomorphology of coastal deltaic floodplains and estuaries in an active delta: Insights from the Atchafalaya Coastal Basin	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						Coastal delta geomorphology; Ecogeomorphology; Coastal deltaic floodplain; Deltaic wetlands; Large river delta estuaries	MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA; GULF-OF-MEXICO; SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; FRESH-WATER; HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY; PLANT PRODUCTIVITY; HURRICANE-KATRINA; FOURLEAGUE BAY; CARBON STORAGE	We present here an integrated analysis of coastal deltaic floodplains in the active Atchafalaya Coastal Basin coupled to downstream deltaic estuaries to review how ecosystem properties self-organize around fluvial processes during river re-occupation as part of the delta cycle. The flood pulse of the river is critical to providing autogenic feedbacks between flow patterns, sediment delivery, vegetation productivity, and organic/inorganic accretion that produce spatial patterns of land elevation, habitat diversity, and estuary dynamics. Coastal deltaic floodplains form in the proximal region of an active delta as bar-shaped islands with interdistributary bays shape hydrogeomorphic zones influenced by both geophysical and ecological processes. Hydrogeomorphic zones in coastal deltaic floodplains of the proximal sedimentation zone can also be defined by time since subaerial emergence accounts for variability in vegetation community composition and soil successional development. The reduction in sedimentation and increase in both above- and belowground biomass associated with formation of hydrogeomorphic zones results in significant increase in organic matter density in soils, with higher N:P ratios reflecting the biotic feedback of ecological succession on delta floodplain development. In both the proximal and distal sedimentation regions, episodic events, such as river floods and cold fronts, control seasonal water levels, marsh platform inundation, and increase in elevation capital. In coastal deltaic floodplains, an increase in vegetation height and density has a twofold effect: it favors trapping of sediment on the islands; whereas an increase in roughness deflects water flow and sediment into the channels thus bypassing the marsh surface. There is evidence that this is in contrast to more constant positive feedback of vegetation on sedimentation in distal estuarine marsh platforms. Delta estuaries go through a transformation from a near-riverine estuary in the winter-spring season to a near-marine lagoon in the summer-fall season. Geomorphological displacement of vegetation types occurs as platform elevation increases in the proximal sedimentation zone as delta landform emerges, with specific vegetation dominating the respective subtidal, intertidal and supratidal hydrogeomorphic zones. This does not occur in the distal sedimentation zone that lack sediment input as marsh platform elevation decreases. This is due to presence of salinity and H2S that limit the capacity of biotic feedbacks to contribute to marsh stability. The growth of a coastal deltaic floodplain in the proximal sedimentation region of Atchafalaya Coastal Basin along with stable estuarine marshes in distal sedimentation region demonstrate the value of longterm riverine influence by preventing loss of wetland platform elevation.

Results show that the total direct CO2 emissions amount to 9.45E + 07 t, within which 56.81% are released from coal combustion, 11.50% from coke combustion, 9.03% from kerosene combustion, 8.70% from natural gas and 6.40% from diesel, respectively. The average intensity of secondary industries (3.12 t/1E + 4 Yuan) is 0.65 times larger than that of primary industries (1.89 t/1E + 4 Yuan) and 1.58 times larger than that of tertiary industries (1.21 t/1E + 4 Yuan). The sector of Construction Industry contributes the largest share (21.98%) of CO2 emissions embodied in final demand for Beijing due to its considerable capital investment. Beijing is a net importer of embodied CO2 emissions with total import and export of 3.06E + 08 and 2.00E + 08 t, respectively. Results of this study provide a sound scientific database for effective policy making in Beijing to reduce CO2 emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pancreatitis is caused by various etiologies, but the mechanism of fibrosis is not completely understood. Existing clinical approaches mainly focus on mitigating the symptoms and therefore do not cure the phenomena. In recent years, there has been a heightened interest in the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHMs) in the prevention and cure of CP as expressed by increasing numbers of clinical and experimental research. Despite early cell culture and animal models, CHMs are able to interact with plenty of molecular targets involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic fibrosis mostly via the TGF-beta/Smads pathway; however, integrated and up-to-date communication in this domain is unavailable. This review focuses on the research progress of CHMs against pancreatic fibrosis due to CP in vitro and in vivo and summarizes the potential mechanisms. We also outlined the toxicology of some CHMs for fibrosis treatment in order to provide a fuller understanding of drug safety. This review may provide reference for further innovative drug research and the future development of treatments for CP with pancreatic fibrosis.

Clarifying the variation regularity of the resilience can provide a theory foundation for the restoration and management of degraded ecosystems. Grassland cultivation has been largely used to restore extensively distributed "Black Beach", the severely degraded alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). However, few researchers have documented the resilience of the revegetated grasslands along the succession gradients. In this study, we surveyed the revegetated grasslands on the QTP at different restoration times: 4-year, 6-year, 9-year, 12-year, 13-year, 14-year, 16-year, 18-year by using chronosequence approach to identify the resilience of the revegetated grasslands from the perspectives of plant and soil quality. We treated "Black Beach" as the baseline for restoration, and non-degraded healthy alpine meadow as the target for the restoration. We used the MDS method to identify the appropriate indicators and created an integrated assessment system that quantified the resilience of plant, soil, plant-soil system of the revegetated grasslands at different recovery years. The results showed that the non-linear resilience of revegetated grasslands were identified for the plant, soil and plant-soil systems along the temporal gradients. The plant resilience of the revegetated grasslands peaked at the 12th recovery year. The soil of the revegetated grasslands was superior to severely degraded grasslands after 13 years of revegetation. Asynchrony existed between the resilience of soil and that of the plant along the temporal gradients. The plant-soil system resilience of the revegetated grasslands peaked at the 16th recovery year. From the perspectives of plant, soil, plant-soil system, the recovery time of severely degraded grassland should be at least 16-18 years to reach a relative stable state. Revegetated grassland can be used as an effective restoration approach to improve the quality and resilience of plant and soil in the severely degraded alpine meadow on the QTP.

Effects of Warming and N Deposition on the Physiological Performances of Leymus secalinus in Alpine Meadow of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; stomatal conductance; antioxidant enzymes; photosynthesis; Leymus secalinus	PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; XANTHOPHYLL CYCLE; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; ELEVATED CO2; GROWTH; CARBON; DROUGHT	Warming and Nitrogen (N) deposition are key global changes that may affect eco-physiological process of territorial plants. In this paper, we examined the effects of warming, N deposition, and their combination effect on the physiological performances of Leymus secalinus. Four treatments were established in an alpine meadow of Qinghai-Tibetan plateau: control (CK), warming (W), N deposition (N), and warming plus N deposition (NW). Warming significantly decreased the photosynthetic rate (A(net) ), stomatal conductance (g(s) ), intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i ), and transpiration rate (T-r ), while N deposition and warming plus N deposition significantly increased those parameters of L. secalinus. Warming significantly increased the VPD and L-s , while N deposition and warming plus N deposition had a significant positive effect. Warming negatively reduced the leaf N content, Chla, Chlb, and total Chl content, while N deposition significantly promoted these traits. Warming, N deposition, and their combination significantly increased the activity of SOD, POD, and CAT. Besides, warming and warming plus N deposition significantly increased the MDA content, while N deposition significantly decreased the MDA content. N deposition and warming plus N deposition significantly increased the Rubisco activity, while warming showed no significant effect on Rubisco activity. N deposition and warming plus N deposition significantly increased the Fv/Fm, phi PSII, qP, and decreased NPQ, while warming significantly decreased the Fv/Fm, phi PSII, qP, and increased NPQ. N deposition strengthened the relations between g(s) , Chl, Chla, Chlb, Rubisco activity, and A(net) . Under warming, only g(s) showed a significantly positive relation with A(net) . Our findings suggested that warming could impair the photosynthetic potential of L. secalinus enhanced by N deposition. Additionally, the combination of warming and N deposition still tend to lead positive effects on L. secalinus.

Jefferson Lab Hall A Collaboration	First measurement of the Ti(e, e ')X cross section at Jefferson Lab	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article							ELECTRON-NUCLEUS SCATTERING; MOMENTUM-TRANSFER; NEUTRINO	To probe CP violation in the leptonic sector using GeV energy neutrino beams in current and future experiments using argon detectors, precise models of the complex underlying neutrino and antineutrino interactions are needed. The E12-14-012 experiment at Jefferson Lab Hall A was designed to perform a combined analysis of inclusive and exclusive electron scatterings on both argon (N = 22) and titanium (Z = 22) nuclei using GeV-energy electron beams. The measurement on titanium nucleus provides essential information to understand the neutrino scattering on argon, large contribution to which comes from scattering off neutrons. Here we report the first experimental study of electron-titanium scattering as double-differential cross section at beam energy E = 2.222 GeV and electron-scattering angle theta = 15.541 degrees, measured over a broad range of energy transfer, spanning the kinematical regions in which quasielastic scattering and delta production are the dominant reaction mechanisms. The data provide valuable new information needed to develop accurate theoretical models of the electromagnetic and weak cross sections of these complex nuclei in the kinematic regime of interest to neutrino experiments.

Three N treatment levels (+0, +50, +150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) were monthly added to soil surface in this forest beginning in April 2013. Soil biochemistry and root biomass of the 0-10 cm soil horizon were measured from May 2014 to April 2015. Soil respiration was measured for two years (September 2013 to August 2015). It was showed that N additions were correlated to significantly lower soil pH, microbial biomass C (MBC) concentration, MBC/microbial biomass N (MBN) ratio, root biomass, and soil respiration rate, and significantly higher concentrations of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-). These results indicate that N additions had a significant effect on the size of soil microbial community. In addition, soil C storage may potentially increase due to the dropped soil C release under N addition.

Global emissions of these perfluorocarbons (PFCs) calculated from atmospheric measurements are significantly greater than expected from reported national and industry-based emission inventories. In this study, in situ measurements of the two PFCs in the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment network are used to show that their emission ratio varies according to the relative regional presence of these two industries, providing an industry-specific emission "signature" to apportion the observed emissions. Our results suggest that underestimated emissions from the global semiconductor industry during 1990-2010, as well as from China's aluminum industry after 2002, account for the observed differences between emissions based on atmospheric measurements and on inventories. These differences are significant despite the large uncertainties in emissions based on the methodologies used by these industries.

Here we initiated a field campaign to collect IVOCs with sorption tubes at both the inlet and the outlet in a busy urban tunnel ( > 30000 vehicles per day) in south China for characterizing emissions of IVOCs from on-road vehicles. The average emission factor of IVOCs EFIVOCs) was measured to be 16.77 +/- 0.89 mg km(-1) (average +/- 95% CI, confidence interval) for diesel and gasoline vehicles in the fleets, and based on linear regression, the average EFIVOCs was derived to be 62.79 +/- 18.37 mg km(-1) for diesel vehicles and 13.95 +/- 1.13 mg km(-1) for gasoline vehicles. The EFIVOCs for diesel vehicles from this study was comparable to that reported previously for non-road engines without after-treatment facilities, while the EFIVOCs for gasoline vehicles from this study was much higher than that recently tested for a China V gasoline vehicle. IVOCs from the on-road fleets did not show significant correlation with the primary organic aerosol (POA) or total non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) as results from previous chassis dynamometer tests. Estimated SOA production from the vehicular IVOCs and VOCs surpassed the POA by a factor of similar to 2.4, and IVOCs dominated over VOCs in estimated SOA production by a factor of similar to 7, suggesting that controlling IVOCs is of greater importance to modulate traffic-related organic aerosol (OA) in urban areas. The results demonstrated that although on-road gasoline vehicles have much lower EFIVOCs, they contribute more IVOCs than on-road diesel vehicles due to its dominance in the on-road fleets. However, due to greater diesel than gasoline fuel consumption in China, emission of IVOCs from diesel engines would be much larger than that from gasoline engines, signaling the overwhelming contribution of IVOC emissions by non-road diesel engines in China.

Many epidemiological studies have been conducted to explore the association between the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and breast cancer risk. However, the results remain inconclusive. In order to derive a more precise estimation of this relationship, a large meta-analysis was performed in this study. Methods: Systematic searches of the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were performed. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the strength of the association. Results: A total of 56 studies including 34,358 breast cancer cases and 45,429 controls were included. Overall, no significant associations between the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and breast cancer risk were found for LL versus HH, HL versus HH, LL versus HL, recessive model LL versus HL+HH, and dominant model LL+HL versus HH. In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, source of controls, and menopausal status, there was still no significant association detected in any of the genetic models. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis results suggest that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism may not contribute to breast cancer susceptibility.

The seasonal variations of the trace elements were primarily controlled by hydrological processes, which determined different sources of the SPM. Moreover, As, Co, Cr, and Ni primarily originated from lithogenic sources, whereas Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn were influenced by anthropogenic activities. The Yellow River has suffered moderate to considerable ecological risk during the late stage of Water and Sediment Regulation (WSR). Using the discharge-weighted contents method, the annual trace element fluxes were estimated, with ca. 30% of the annual fluxes occurring within the short WSR period (6% of one year). More specifically, 75% of the Cd flux was from an anthropogenic source, which likely posed a significant threat to the estuary and the adjacent coastal ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Plant biomass allocation and driving factors of grassland revegetation in a Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau chronosequence	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						biomass allocation; isometric allocation; optimal partitioning; revegetated grassland; structural equation model; trade&#8208; offs	BELOW-GROUND BIOMASS; DEGRADED ALPINE MEADOWS; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SOIL QUALITY; TRADE-OFFS; CARBON; ROOT; DEGRADATION	Biomass allocation is a key factor in understanding how ecosystems respond to changing environmental conditions. The role of soil chemistry in the above- and belowground plant biomass allocation in restoring grassland is still incompletely characterized. Consequently, it has led to two competing hypotheses for biomass allocation: optimal partitioning, where the plants allocate biomass preferentially to optimize resource use; and the isometric hypothesis, which postulates that biomass allocation between roots and shoots is fixed. Here we tested these hypotheses over a chronosequence of alpine grasslandsion undergoing restoration in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, these range from severely degraded to those with 18 years of revegetation with an intact grassland (as a reference). A high proportion of biomass was allocated to the roots in the revegetated grasslands, and more biomass to shoots in the degraded and intact grasslands. The grasslands gradually decreased their root to shoot ratio as revegetation continued, with the lowest value in year 18 of revegetation. Our results showed that aboveground biomass (AGB) was increased by available phosphorus (P), soil moisture, and negatively related to bulk density, while belowground biomass (BGB) was positively impacted by total P and negatively by nitrate nitrogen (N). The trade-off between them was positively associated with available P and nitrate-N, and soil nutrient availability is more linked to increased AGB relative to BGB. Our study indicates that biomass allocation is highly variable during the revegetation period from degraded grassland, and is linked with soil properties, thus supporting the optimal partitioning hypothesis.

DNA vaccination has been proven to be a very effective method in conferring protection against fish viruses. However, DNA vaccines for GCRV II have not yet been conducted on grass carp. In the current work, we vaccinated grass carp with a DNA vaccine consisting of the segment 6 (pC-S6; encoding VP4) or 10 (pC-S10; encoding NS38) of GCRV II and comparatively analyzed the immune responses induced by these two vaccines. The protective efficacy of pC-S6 and pC-S10, in terms of relative percentage survival (RPS), was 59.9% and 23.1% respectively. This suggests that pC-S6 and pC-S10 DNA vaccines could increase the survival rate of grass carp against GCRV, albeit with variations in immunoprotective effect. Immunological analyses indicated the following. First, post-vaccination (pv), both pC-S6 and pC-S10 up-regulated the expression of interferon (IFN-1), Mx1, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. However, CD4 and CD8 alpha were up-regulated in the case of pC-S6 but not pC-S10. Second, comparing non-vaccinated and pC-S10-vaccinated fish, the T cell response related genes, such as CD4, CD8 alpha, and GATA3, were elevated in pC-S6-vaccinated fish at 48 h post-challenge (pc). Third, pC-S6 and pC-S10 induced similar patterns of specific antibody response pv. However, only anti-VP4 IgM in the sera of surviving fish infected with GCRV was significantly increased pc compared with that pre-challenge. Taken together, these results indicate that pC-S6 promotes both innate (IFN-1 and Mx1 induction) and adaptive CT cell and specific antibody response) immunity pv and that the induction of a memory state promptly primes the immune response upon later encounters with the virus, whereas pC-S10 only induces the type I IFN-related response pv and a lower inflammatory response pc.

However, most of the papers focus on single MOF derivatives; reports on multicomponent MOF derivatives and their catalytic studies are relatively few. Here, we report an easy-to-operate strategy to obtain multicomponent MOF derivatives by treating multicomponent MOFs under a suitable gas atmosphere and at high temperature. We used ZIF-67 as a template to introduce Zn and successfully obtained multicomponent MOFs. After carbonization, the multicomponent MOF derivatives with Co and CoO nanoparticles exhibit higher conversion of styrene (approximate to 99%), higher selectivity (approximate to 70%) and better stability compared to MOFs and single component MOF derivatives.

Nickel oxide nanoparticles induced pulmonary fibrosis via TGF-1 activation in rats	HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Nanoparticle; nickel oxide; pulmonary fibrosis; collagen; TGF-1	TISSUE GROWTH-FACTOR; EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION; BETA/SMAD SIGNALING PATHWAY; WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; ACUTE OXIDATIVE STRESS; INTRATRACHEAL INSTILLATION; NIO NANOPARTICLES; LUNG FIBROSIS; CERIUM OXIDE; IN-VITRO	Nano nickel oxide (NiO), widely used in industry, has recently been discovered to have pulmonary toxicity. However, no subchronic exposure studies about nano NiO-induced pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. The objective of this study was to investigate pulmonary fibrosis induced by nano NiO and its potential mechanism in rats. Male Wistar rats (n = 40, 200-240 g) were randomized into control group, nano NiO groups (0.015, 0.06, and 0.24 mg/kg), and micro NiO group (0.024 mg/kg). All rats were killed to collect lung tissue after intratracheal instillation of NiO particles twice a week for 6 weeks. To identify pulmonary fibrosis, Masson trichrome staining, hydroxyproline content, and collagen protein expression were performed. The results showed widespread lung fibrotic injury in histological examination and increased content of hydroxyproline, collagen types I and III in rat lung tissue exposed to nano NiO. To explore the potential pulmonary fibrosis mechanism, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-1) content was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the messenger RNA expression of key indicators was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The TGF-1 content was increased in nano NiO exposure groups, as well as the upregulated gene expression of TGF-1, Smad2, Smad4, matrix metalloproteinase, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase. The findings indicated that nano NiO could induce pulmonary fibrosis, which may be related to TGF-1 activation.	[Chang, X. H.; Zhu, A.; Liu, F. F.; Zou, L. Y.; Su, L.; Liu, S. K.; Zhou, H.

The -70 species of woody plants that anchor the coastal ecosystems of the tropics, collectively referred to as mangroves, are particularly suited to this exploration. In this study, we de novo sequenced the whole genomes of 32 mangroves, which we combined with other sequences of 30 additional species, comprising almost all mangroves globally. These community-wide genomic data will be valuable for ecology, evolution and biodiversity research. While the data revealed 27 independent origins of mangroves, the total phylogeny shows only modest increases in species number, even in coastal areas of active speciation, suggesting that mangrove extinction is common. A possible explanation for common extinction is the frequent sea-level rises and falls (SLRs and SLFs) documented in the geological record. Indeed, near-extinctions of species with extremely small population size (N) often happened during periods of rapid SLR, as revealed by the genome-wide heterozygosity of almost all mangroves. Reduction in N has possibly been further compounded by population fragmentation and the subsequent accumulation of deleterious mutations, thus pushing mangroves even closer to extinction. Crucially, the impact of the next SLR will be exacerbated by human encroachment into these mangrove habitats, potentially altering the ecosystems of tropical coasts irreversibly.

Magnetometry is a powerful tool for fathoming electrons in solids, by which a clear method for discerning relativistic quasiparticles has not yet been established. Adopting the probes of magnetic torque and parallel magnetization for the archetype Weyl semimetal TaAs in strong magnetic field, we observed a quasi-linear field dependent effective transverse magnetization and a non-saturating parallel magnetization when the system enters the quantum limit. Distinct from the saturating magnetic responses for non-relativistic quasiparticles, the non-saturating signals of TaAs in strong field is consistent with our newly developed magnetization calculation for a Weyl fermion system in an arbitrary angle. Our results establish a high-field thermodynamic method for detecting the magnetic response of relativistic quasiparticles in topological materials.

The similar to 70 species of woody plants that anchor the coastal ecosystems of the tropics, collectively referred to as mangroves, are particularly suited to this exploration. In this study, we de novo sequenced the whole genomes of 32 mangroves, which we combined with other sequences of 30 additional species, comprising almost all mangroves globally. These community-wide genomic data will be valuable for ecology, evolution and biodiversity research. While the data revealed 27 independent origins of mangroves, the total phylogeny shows only modest increases in species number, even in coastal areas of active speciation, suggesting that mangrove extinction is common. A possible explanation for common extinction is the frequent sea-level rises and falls (SLRs and SLFs) documented in the geological record. Indeed, near-extinctions of species with extremely small population size (N) often happened during periods of rapid SLR, as revealed by the genome-wide heterozygosity of almost all mangroves. Reduction in N has possibly been further compounded by population fragmentation and the subsequent accumulation of deleterious mutations, thus pushing mangroves even closer to extinction. Crucially, the impact of the next SLR will be exacerbated by human encroachment into these mangrove habitats, potentially altering the ecosystems of tropical coasts irreversibly.

Atmospheric Humic-Like Substances (HULIS) Act as Ice Active Entities	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-WEIGHT COMPOUNDS; ORGANIC AEROSOL FORMATION; PEARL RIVER DELTA; SEA SPRAY AEROSOL; NUCLEATING PARTICLES; LIGHT-SCATTERING; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; AMBIENT AEROSOLS; BROWN CARBON; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS	We investigated the ice nucleation activities of humic-like substances (HULIS), an important component of organic aerosol (OA), derived from atmospheric and biomass burning aerosols, and produced from aqueous-phase chemical reactions. Respective HULIS can effectively trigger heterogeneous IN under mixed-phase cloud conditions. HULIS ice active entities (IAE) were aggregates in size between 0.02 and 0.10 mu m. At -20 degrees C, the IAE numbers per unit HULIS mass varied from 213 to 8.7 x 10(4) mg(-1). Such results were different than those detected in aquatic humic substances (HS) from previous studies, implying using HS as surrogates may not robustly estimate the IAE concentrations in the real atmosphere. Combining the abundance of atmospheric HULIS with the present results suggests that HULIS could be an important IAE contributor in the atmosphere where other ice nucleating particle species, such as dust and biological particles, are either low in concentration or absent.

Global and regional emission estimates for HCFC-22	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							EAST-ASIA; TROPOSPHERIC OH; GASES; TRANSPORT; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; INVERSION; HISTORY; GROWTH; TREND	HCFC-22 (CHClF2, chlorodifluoromethane) is an ozone-depleting substance (ODS) as well as a significant greenhouse gas (GHG). HCFC-22 has been used widely as a refrigerant fluid in cooling and air-conditioning equipment since the 1960s, and it has also served as a traditional substitute for some chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) controlled under the Montreal Protocol. A low frequency record on tropospheric HCFC-22 since the late 1970s is available from measurements of the Southern Hemisphere Cape Grim Air Archive (CGAA) and a few Northern Hemisphere air samples (mostly from Trinidad Head) using the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) instrumentation and calibrations. Since the 1990s high-frequency, high-precision, in situ HCFC-22 measurements have been collected at these AGAGE stations. Since 1992, the Global Monitoring Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL) has also collected flasks on a weekly basis from remote sites across the globe and analyzed them for a suite of halocarbons including HCFC-22. Additionally, since 2006 flasks have been collected approximately daily at a number of tower sites across the US and analyzed for halocarbons and other gases at NOAA. All results show an increase in the atmospheric mole fractions of HCFC-22, and recent data show a growth rate of approximately 4% per year, resulting in an increase in the background atmospheric mole fraction by a factor of 1.7 from 1995 to 2009. Using data on HCFC-22 consumption submitted to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), as well as existing bottom-up emission estimates, we first create globally-gridded a priori HCFC-22 emissions over the 15 yr since 1995. We then use the three-dimensional chemical transport model, Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers version 4 (MOZART v4), and a Bayesian inverse method to estimate global as well as regional annual emissions. Our inversion indicates that the global HCFC-22 emissions have an increasing trend between 1995 and 2009. We further find a surge in HCFC-22 emissions between 2005 and 2009 from developing countries in Asia - the largest emitting region including China and India. Globally, substantial emissions continue despite production and consumption being phased out in developed countries currently.	[Saikawa, E.; Rigby, M.; Prinn, R.

ATLAS Collaboration	Prompt and non-prompt J/psi and psi(2S) suppression at high transverse momentum in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS experiment	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article							PB-PB COLLISIONS; QUARKONIUM PRODUCTION; MONTE-CARLO; NUCLEAR; CHARMONIA; RAPIDITY	A measurement of J/psi and psi(2S) production is presented. It is based on a data sample from Pb+Pb collisions at root s(NN) = 5.02 TeV and pp collisions at root s = 5.02 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2015, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.42 nb(-1) and 25 pb(-1) in Pb+Pb and pp, respectively. The measurements of per-event yields, nuclear modification factors, and non-prompt fractions are performed in the dimuon decay channel for 9 < p(T)(mu mu) < 40 GeV in dimuon transverse momentum, and -2 < y(mu mu) < 2 in rapidity. Strong suppression is found in Pb+Pb collisions for both prompt and non-prompt J/psi, increasing with event centrality. The suppression of prompt psi(2S) is observed to be stronger than that of J/psi, while the suppression of non-prompt psi(2S) is equal to that of the non-prompt J/psi within uncertainties, consistent with the expectation that both arise from b-quarks propagating through the medium. Despite prompt and non-prompt J/psi arising from different mechanisms, the dependence of their nuclear modification factors on centrality is found to be quite similar.
