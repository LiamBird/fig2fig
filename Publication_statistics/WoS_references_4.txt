With the widespread use of traditional Chinese medicines in the treatment of diseases and health care, a great deal of herb residues are thrown away after the unique decoction process. Here, through hydrothermal carbonization combined with KOH activation, a micropore-rich and nitrogen-doped porous carbon framework (MRNCF) is prepared from the waste roots of a kind of well-known and widely used traditional Chinese medicine, Acanthopanax senticosus. Compared with ordinary carbon-based sulfur host materials, the MRNCFs can effectively hinder the shuttling effect and dissolution of polysulfides through the synergistic action of physical confinement in micropores and chemical anchoring for nitrogen doping, and the lithium-sulfur batteries using MRNCF as the host present superior electrochemical performance. In a high sulfur content of over 75%, the as-prepared electrodes exhibit a highly reversible specific capacity of 540.4 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.5C after 150 cycles and an excellent rate capability at different current densities.

The sulfur loading in these two POFs reached 61%, benefitting from their large pore volumes. Owing to the highly dense docking sites of TEMPO, sulfur could be covalently immobilized within the porous networks and efficiently inhibit the shuttle effect, thereby significantly improving the cycling performance. The composites TPE-TEMPO-POF-S (TPE = tetraphenylethene) deliver a capacity in excess of 470 mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of around 100% at a current rate of 0.1 C. Furthermore, TEMPO-POFs with sulfur embedded showed excellent rate capability with limited capacity loss at rates of 0.1-1 C.

Results indicated the amorphous carbon-modified electrode is more effective to improve initial Coulombic efficiency than the graphitized carbon-modified electrode. With high porosity (81%) and amorphous crystal structure, the low cost micro-hollow carbon fiber foam electrode provides high and stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% for more than 100 cycles when the areal capacity of electrode approaches 6 mAh cm (2).

The spontaneously damage repair ability of such a binder can be applied to overcome the short cycle-life issue of lithium-sulfur batteries under low current density with deep galvanostatic cycling. Diamines and polybasic acids are used to synthesize the supramolecular self-healing material. 10wt% amine groups in this designed material provide a large amount of chemical adsorption sites for polysulfides which can effectively inhibit the shuttling of polysulfides and maintain the content of sulfur species in cathode. This N-rich binder is mixed with the sulfur during preparation, which can improve the effective contacting surface of N function groups and sulfur locally. The cells with pure self-healing material binder achieve an initial capacity of 918mAhg(-1), and maintain a reversible capacity of 469mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1C, twice higher than the retention capacity of cells with polyvinylidene fluoride binder. After optimization, the cells with a hybrid binder of self-healing material and polyvinylidene fluoride (weight ratio of 1:1) with a sulfur loading of 2.65mgcm(-2) achieve an initial capacity of 993mAhg(-1), and remain a reversible capacity of 571mAhg(-1) with a capacity fade of 0.2% per cycle after 200 cycles at 0.1C.

To this context, we developed porous carbon/MnO2 (PCMO) composites as sulfur host materials to increase the adsorption ability between the PCMO host and polysulfide. The MnO2 particles embedded on the porous carbon severe as active sites to effectively adsorb and catalyze the polysulfide, therefore improving the redox kinetics and reducing shuttle effect. More importantly, the porous structure of the carbon can provide pathways for the lithium-ion diffusion, which accelerates the ion transport through the electrode. Owing to these merits, the as-prepared PCMO/S cathode exhibits high capacity, stable cycle performance and excellent rate capability.

Highly conductive and environmentally friendly porous carbon exhibited unique advantages in these aspects. Here, we present a facile and yet efficient strategy for a highly polar surface and ultrahigh surface area in porous carbon frameworks by one-step carbonization of the single-precursor metal organic framework that was built by mixed N- and P-containing ligands (NPMOF) in which N and P heteroatoms that provide a large number of exposed polar groups are in situ incorporated in the surface of the carbon framework. The highly polar surface and the interconnected pore with a considerably specific area maximizes the affinity for polar CO, and polysulfide molecules, engendering this material excellent CO, capture with exceptional cycling stability and renewability and the outstanding performance for the lithium-sulfur battery with high specific capacity and excellent stability. This work demonstrates the great advantages in making porous materials from MOFs for multifunctionality.

Herein, a hierarchical interlayer constructed by boroxine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high Li+ conductivity is fabricated via an in situ polymerization method on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (C@COF). The as-prepared interlayer delivers a high Li+ ionic conductivity (1.85 mS cm(-1)) and Li+ transference number (0.78), which not only acts as a physical barrier, but also a bidirectional catalyst for LiPSs redox process owing to the abundant heterointerfaces between the inner conductive CNTs and the outer COFs. After coupling such a catalytic interlayer with sulfur cathode, the LSBs exhibit a low decay rate of 0.07% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C, and long cycle life at 3 C (over 1000 cycles). More importantly, a remarkable areal capacity of around 4.69 mAh cm(-2) can still be maintained after 50 cycles even under a high sulfur loading condition (6.8 mg cm(-2)). This work paves a new way for the design of the interlayer with bidirectional catalytic behavior in LSBs.

To suppress LiPS dissolution, we propose a facile method to fabricate a Li-ion-conductive polymer layer by photopolymerization. The electrochemical performance of LSBs was investigated by preparing small pouch cells containing a three-dimensional (3D) structured sulfur-based cathode that either was or was not layered with the new polymer. Analysis of the electrolyte in the LSB pouch cell by UV-Vis spectroscopy revealed that a 3D S cathode with polymer layer shows a good discharge capacity of 535 mA h g(-1) and a coulombic efficiency (CE) of over 96% after 40 cycles. In comparison, the 3D S cathode without a polymer layer has a poor discharge capacity of 389 mA h g(-1) and a CE of over 22% after 40 cycles. The dissolution suppressing ability of our new polymer layer demonstrates promise for the practical application of LSBs. (C) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

In response to this issue, a method for rapid microwave sulfonation, nitrification and oxidation of DMMs was proposed to convert DMMs with low carbonization efficiency into aromatic carbon with good thermal stability, which not only maintained 51 wt% of initial mass at 1000 ??C, but also achieved in situ co-doping of S, N and O. Subsequently, porous carbons derived from DMMs were synthesized by self-activation pyrolysis, which avoided consumption of alkali and metal salts in the traditional activation process. It was further found that low pyrolysis temperature was not enough to produce enough active material H2 and H2O to obtain high specific surface area, while increasing pyrolysis temperature could adjust the specific surface area of as-prepared carbon, ranging from 52 m2???g???1 to as high as 890 m2 g-1. Thanks to synergistic effect of S, N, and O co-doping and hierarchical porous structure, the first discharge specific capacity of sample synthesized by self-activated pyrolysis at 900 ??C was 1459.8 mAh???g???1 at 0.1 C, and the discharge specific capacity retention at 0.5 C after 400 cycles was 52.3%.

Therefore, a functional separator suitable for LSBs has aroused great interest. In this work, we report a novel functional separator using LiVPO4F together with carbon nanotube (LVPF/CNT) as functional coating. The LVPF/CNT modified separator not only acts as a conductive layer to facilitate electron and lithium ion (Li+) transport, but also provides chemisorption for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and improves the electrochemical kinetics of LSBs. Thus, the cell with LVPF/CNT modified separator delivers an excellent cycle life with the capacity of 578.5 mAh g (-1) after 1000 cycles at 1.5C. An ultra-long cycle life (551 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles at 0.5C) and a high areal capacity of 5.58 mAh cm(-2) are obtained at a high sulfur loading of 7 mg cm(-2). Moreover, the visualized transformation of the LiPSs in the tailor-made cell is also revealed by in situ XRD, while the density functional theory (DFT) simulated the principle of the interaction between the LVPF and LiPSs. This work provides a promising and insightful research to develop the progressive LSBs with functional separator.

A sulfur-functionalized COF with high sulfur content (60 wt %) was obtained through physisorption of elemental sulfur and subsequent SNAr reaction of sulfur with aromatic fluorides on the COF backbone. After such physical and chemical confinement of sulfur through a postfunctionalization approach, the COF material still shows some structural order, allowing us to investigate the structure-property relationship of such COF materials in LSB application. We compared the electro-chemical performances of the two cathode materials prepared from a crystalline COF and its amorphous counterpart and studied the important factors that affect battery capacity, reaction kinetics, and cycling stability.

However, the shuttling effect and volumetric expansion of sulfur electrodes often lead to low Coulombic efficiency and C-rate capacity for the lithium-sulfur battery. In this work, we develop a novel sulfur-rich triazine-trithiophene-triacetylenicbenzene conjugated porous polymer cathode material (TBP-S) by a covalent linkage between a conjugated porous polymer and sulfur. The as-prepared material shows combinative features of the functions of supports, conductors, and adsorbents, resulting in the effective suppression of the shuttling effect. Specifically, the cell based on the TBP-80S cathode material shows outstanding C-rate capacity at the current of 5C (discharge capacity of 756 mAh g(-1)). Furthermore, the Coulombic efficiency of the cell retains up to 99.6% after 400 cycles at 0.5C. These results demonstrate that this type of sulfur-rich conjugated porous polymer has a great potential as excellent cathode material for a lithium-sulfur battery with high Coulombic efficiency and superior C-rate capacity.

Hole Polaron Diffusion in the Final Discharge Product of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; CHARGE-TRANSPORT MECHANISMS; INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; ELASTIC BAND METHOD; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; CARBON; LI-O-2; LI2S; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY	Poor electronic conductivity of bulk lithium sulfide (Li2S) is a critical challenge for the debilitating performance of the lithium-sulfur battery. This study focuses on investigating the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of native defects in Li2S based on a first-principles approach. It is found that the hole polaron p(+) can form in Li2S by removing a 3p electron from an S2- anion. The p(+) diffusion barrier is only 90 meV, which is much lower than the Li vacancy (V-Li(-)) diffusion barrier. Hence p(+) has the potential to serve as a charge carrier in the discharge product. Once the vacancy-polaron complex (V-Li(-)-2p(+)) forms, the charge transport will be hindered due to the relatively higher diffusion barrier of the complex. Heteroatom dopants, which can decrease the p(+) formation energy and increase V-Li(-) formation energy, are expected to be introduced to the discharge product to improve the electronic conductivity.

However, they exhibit poor discharge capacity and capacity retention during long-term cycling because of their inherent drawbacks including the poor conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and the large volume expansion of sulfur to lithium sulfide. An effective approach that can solve these problems is to use an interlayer inserted between the separator and the cathode. Nevertheless, the underlying adsorption mechanism of LiPSs on the interlayer has not yet been widely investigated. Herein, the effect of lithium bond chemistry on the adsorption of LiPSs on the functionalized carbon fiber paper (CFP) interlayer containing hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amide functional groups is investigated by a density functional theory approach. It is found that the functionalized CFP exhibits a strong lithium bond interaction between the Li electron acceptor of LiPSs and the N or O electron donor of the functionalized CFP interlayer. In addition, the correlation between the adsorption energy of LiPSs on the interlayer and the electrochemical performance of LSBs is investigated. The results provide the fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship for the adsorption of LiPSs on the functional groups of the interlayer, which will be beneficial for the further development of advanced LSBs.

J	Fahad, S; Wei, Z; Kushima, A				Fahad, Saisaban; Wei, Zhen; Kushima, Akihiro			In-situ TEM observation of fast and stable reaction of lithium polysulfide infiltrated carbon composite and its application as a lithium sulfur battery electrode for improved cycle lifetime	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL LITHIATION; NANOTUBES; PAPER; CYCLABILITY; SEPARATOR; CATHODE; BINDER; CLOTH	Lithium sulfur batteries (LSB) are attracting attention as a next generation energy storage device because of their high energy density, low cost, and environmental friendliness surpassing that of lithium ion batteries (LIBs). An in-situ transmission electron microscopy experiment performed in this work revealed a fast electrochemical reaction and minimum volume changes during lithiation and delithiation for lithium polysulfide infiltrated vat black particles. Based on this observation, we developed a simple and cost-effective method for the lithium polysulfide battery to achieve high performance by employing a nanostructured vat black/carbon cloth electrode that exhibits high electrical conductivity, good mechanical properties, and a high surface area. These benefits enabled a high sulfur loading mass, captured the lithium polysulfide intermediate reaction products, and avoided structural changes. As a result, high specific discharge capacity of 1300 mAhg(-1) at 0.2 C, an outstanding rate performance (846 mAhg 1 at 2 C) and an areal capacity of up to 3.352 mAhcm(-2) with a sulfur loading mass of 3.8 mg were achieved. Increasing the sulfur loading mass to 7 mg (areal capacity of up to 4.24 mAhcm(-2)) still resulted in a desirable discharge capacity of 928 mAhg(-1). This work provides a promising path towards practical lithium sulfur batteries.

Replacing lithium-ion battery is the maximum problem to be overcome. In order to solve this problem, we use a cage like microporous MOF(CPM-5) as a carbon source, which is carbonized at high temperature to get a micro-mesoporous carbon composite material. In addition, indium oxide particles formed during carbonization are deposited on CPM-5 structure, forming a simple core-shell structure CPM-5-C-600. When it is used as the cathode of Li-S battery, the small molecule sulfide can be confined in the micropores, while the existence of large pore size mesopores can provide a channel for the transmission of lithium ions, so as to improve the conductivity of the material and the rate performance of the battery. After 100 cycles, the specific capacity of the battery can be still maintained at 650 mA hg(-1) and the Coulombic efficiency is close to 100%. When the rate goes up to 2 C, the first discharge capacity not only can reach 1400 mA hg(-1), but also still provides 500 mA hg(-1) after 200 cycles, showing excellent rate performance.

However, the sluggish redox kinetics and shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), especially at high sulfur loading, result in low sulfur utilization, low Coulombic efficiency, and short cycle life. Herein, an entangled N-doped carbon nanotube array with encapsulated Co nanoparticles has been constructed and used as an efficient host for sulfur cathode featuring both physical and chemical trapping ability for soluble LiPSs. Besides, the encapsulated Co nanoparticles combined with N species can accelerate polysulfides redox, which has been proved by electrochemical analysis, in situ spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. The effective confinement and fast conversion of polysulfides ensure the Li-S battery with a high capacity of 1045 mAh g(-1) at 1 C rate and 77.89% capacity retention even after 1000 cycles, and these advantages can even be extended to sulfur loading as high as 15 mg cm(-2). More significantly, a pouch cell assembled with the composite sulfur cathode can deliver a stable cycling for more than 150 cycles, further demonstrating the great potential of Li-S batteries for practical applications.

Utilizing sulfur as the cathode material is advantageous due to its low price, non-toxicity, and abundant resources. The main bottleneck hindering the practical application of LSBs is their poor cycling performance due to the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), poor conductivity, and sluggish redox reaction. Herein, we prepared a new type of p-n heterostructure embedded into carbon hollow nanosheet arrays grown on carbon cloth by subsequent sulfidation and nitridation. The hollow heterostructures can sufficiently restrict the dissolution of LiPSs due to the polar chemisorption and physical confinement, and facilitate polysulfide redox kinetics (Li2Sx Li2S, 2 x 8). The abundant active sites and boundary defects constructed by the Co9S8-Co4N heterostructures improve the nucleation/conversion redox kinetics of Li2S. Also, the hollow structure can increase the sulfur loading and supply enough space for relieving the volume expansion during the whole cycling process. After melting the diffused sulfur of the nanocomposites, the resulting free-standing S/CC@Co9S8-Co4N electrode exhibits a highly stable cycling rate with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle at 5.0C over 1000 cycles. Our work provides a potential avenue for constructing heterostructured materials for LSBs with high performance.

This work reports a Mott-Schottky RGO-PANI/MoS2 (RPM) heterogeneous layer modified separator for commercial-sulfur-based LSBs through the vertical growth of molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) arrays on the polyaniline (PANI) in situ reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Due to the synergistic effects of the "reservoir" constructed by MoS2 and RGO-PANI, strong absorbability, high conductivity, and electrocatalytic activity, RPM exhibits a successive "trapping-interception-conversion" behavior toward lithium polysulfides. As a result, the LSBs assembled using a commercial-sulfur as the cathode and RPM as modified layer exhibit high sulfur utilization (3.8 times higher than that of the unmodified separator at 5 C), excellent rate performance (553 mAh g(-1) at 10 C), and outstanding high-rate cycle stability (524 mAh g(-1) after 700 cycles at 5 C). Moreover, even at a high sulfur loading of 5.4 mg cm(-2), a favorable areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm(-2) is still maintained after 80 cycles. Theoretical calculations elucidate that such a systematic strategy can effectively suppress the shuttling effect and boost the catalytic conversion of intercepted polysulfides. This work may provide a feasible strategy to promote the practical application of commercial-sulfur-based LSBs.

However, the migration of high-order lithium polysulfides (LiPs) to the lithium surface and the sluggish electrochemical kinetics pose challenges to their commercialization. The interactions between the cathode and LiPs can be enhanced by the doping of the carbon host with heteroatoms, however with relatively low doping content (<10%) in the bulk of the carbon, which can hardly interact with LiPs at the host surface. In this study, the grafting of versatile functional groups with designable properties (e.g., catalytic effects) directly on the surface of the carbon host is proposed to enhance interactions with LiPs. As model systems, benzene groups containing N/O and S/O atoms are vertically grafted and uniformly distributed on the surface of expanded reduced graphene oxide, fostering a stable interface between the cathode and LiPs. The combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate improvements in chemical interactions between graphene and LiPs, with an enhancement in the electrochemical kinetics, power, and energy densities.

However, it has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate the controlled synthesis of MCNs with tunable closed pore structures via a silica-assisted coassembly strategy, which employs polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymers as soft template, phenolic resol and tetraethyl orthosilicate as carbon and silica precursors, respectively. Through simply varying the sequential cross-linking of the silica and carbon precursors or the copolymer composition, novel MCNs with alluring spherical, hollow-hoop-structured, or yolk-shell-like closed mesopores are tunably prepared. In particular, serving as cathode materials of lithium-sulfur batteries, the resultant silica-hybridized MCNs with the exceptional hollow-hoop mesopores and a moderate sulfur-loading content of 46 wt % exhibit top-level electrochemical performance.

J	Gupta, A; Manthiram, A				Gupta, Abhay; Manthiram, Arumugam			Unifying the clustering kinetics of lithium polysulfides with the nucleation behavior of Li2S in lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							CONVERSION; DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; BARRIERS; CARBON; LIFE; CELL	Within the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, a wide variety of soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates form during operation. Under lean-electrolyte or low-temperature conditions, the solution coordination of polysulfides dynamically shifts to highly clustered states, which is subsequently accompanied by inhibited electrochemical kinetics. In fact, it has been shown that the tendency for polysulfides to strongly aggregate is one of the dominant kinetically limiting obstacles towards achieving adequate utilization of active material under such conditions. While this association has been noted before, it is not explicitly understood what mechanism intrinsic to polysulfide clustering curtails the electrochemical utilization of active material, particularly during the conversion to insoluble Li2S. Here, we perform a series of investigations to unify and link the kinetic constraints that arise from polysulfide clustering to the nucleation and growth behavior of Li2S. We find that there is a drastic decrease in polysulfide diffusion coefficient arising from the advent of clustering, and that this decline functionally matches that seen for the nucleation and growth rate constants for Li2S deposition. Additionally, it is found that there is a less favorable minimization of energy during Li2S nucleation, arising from the altered solvation stability of polysulfide clusters. This knowledge expands our understanding of the Li-S materials chemistry and the primary factors dictating the electrochemical behavior.

During the solution vulcanization procedure, the double bonds (C=C) in butadiene rubber are chemically cross-linked with sulfur. Moreover, the sulfur canalso self-polymerize into polymeric sulfur with long molecular chain. The polymeric sulfur chains penetrate into the crosslinked BR network to form a unique semi-internal penetration network (semi-IPN) confinement structure, which can effectively alleviate the dissolution and diffusion of intermediate polysulfide into electrolytes. Meanwhile, the obtained sulfur-rich polymeric composites have high sulfur contents even over 90%. As a result, the as-prepared sulfur-rich polymeric composites (BR-SPC) with network confine caged structure exhibit excellent cycling stability and high coulombic efficiency. An initial discharge specific capacity of 811 mA h g(-1) is reached, and retains 671 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. The capacity retention rate and coulombic efficiency are 83%, 100%, respectively. Additionally, Super P (carbon black) was added in situ before vulcanization to increase the conductivity of BR-SPC composites. The BR-SPC composite containing Super P (BR-SPC-SP) reveals higher capacity retention of 85% over 50 cycles at 0.5 C than the BR-SPC composite without Super P.

However, the slow redox kinetics caused by the low conductivity of sulfur and the shuttle effect result from lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) limit its practical utility. In this work, a highly efficient strategy of freestanding carbon cloth supported molybdenum oxide (CC/MoO3) with in situ deposition of Li2S8 as an active matrix is designed. This chemistry enables strong affinity of Li2S8 on CC/MoO3 electrode, meanwhile, the strong polarity of MoO3 catalyzes the mutual transformation of LiPSs and inhibits the shuttle of liquid LiPSs. With the above superiorities, the CC/MoO3@Li2S8 electrode shows impressive electrochemical performance, with a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1274 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.1 C with the sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2), and a capacity retention rate of 93.1% compared to the initial stable specific capacity. Even with a high sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2), it still maintains high electrochemical activity with a high reversible specific capacity of 916 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Those results show that coupling polar metal oxide material with flexible conductive carbon cloth provides a highly efficient catalytic/conductive network to accelerate sulfur utilization and stability.

However, poor capacity retention, polysulfide shuttle effect, and low electronic conductivity have hindered practical uses of the LSB. The introduction of interlayer has been proven to be a promising strategy to improve the overall performance of the LSB. Herein, the influence of various amine-based functional groups of carbon interlayer on lithium polysulfide (LPS) chemisorption was compared via electrochemical methods and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The functionalized carbon interlayers with 4-aminobenzoic acid, 1,6-diaminohexane, p-phenylenediamine, 4-nitroaniline, and 4-aminothiophenol prepared by an amide coupling reaction show a strong contribution to reduce the polysulfide migration, resulting in the enhancement of overall LSB performances such as a superior capacity and high Coulombic efficiency along with long cyclability of the cells. The LSB with 4-aminobenzoic acid could achieve an initial specific capacity of 1694 mAh g(-1) (0.1 C) with an extremely low capacity decay of 0.055% per cycle due to the cooperative interaction of H- and Li-bonds between 4-aminobenzoic acid-functionalized interlayer and polysulfides.

The design involves integrating carbon nanotubes with titanium dioxide by a facile room-temperature hydrolytic method to form a titanium dioxide coated carbon nanotube composite (CNT@TiO2) with customizable TiO2 content. The CNT@TiO2 composite was then coated on a separator to form an interlayer much thinner than other standalone interlayers. The TiO2 coating on the CNT surface provides the facility for lithium polysulfides (LiPS) interception by chemisorption, and the underlying CNT core renders the intercepted LiPS electrochemically viable in charging and discharging. A good balance between the chemisorption properties of TiO2 and the charge transport properties of the CNTs is required to deliver a good interlayer performance because of the complementarity of these functions. Consequently, a battery with an optimized CNT@TiO2 interlayer composition could deliver a high initial capacity of 1351 mA h g(-1) and a discharge capacity of 803 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1C, for less than half of the thickness of a typical standalone interlayer (12 mu m).

The well-designed cathode region presented two special characteristics: one was the intertwined nanofibers interlayer based on ultrafine TiO2 nanocrystal uniformly embedded within N-doping porous carbon; the other was the lightweight and three-dimensional current collector of fibrous cellulose paper coated by reduced graphene oxide. In consequence, the decent reversible capacity of 874.8 mA h g(-1) was acquired at 0.1 C with a capacity retention of 91.83% after 100 cycles. Besides, the satisfactory capacity of 670 mA h g(-1) was delivered after 300 cycles at 1 C with the small decay rate of only 0.08%. Because of higher capacity and lower loading of inactive component in cathode region, the energy density of cell increased more than five times compared with unmodified cell. Moreover, to further enhance the energy density, the high-sulfur-loading electrode was fabricated. A good areal capacity of 4.27 mA h cm(-2) was retained for the cell with the active material of 4 mg cm(-2) and the cycle stability was also well-maintained. In addition, due to the flexibility of interlayer and current collector, Li-S full cell (in pouch cell format) was easily curved. Therefore, the synergistic design for cathode region, which combines the flexible and mass-produced interlayer and current collector together, provides an effective access to Li-S batteries with high energy density and flexibility for practical application.

At high loadings of the active material (50-60 wt %), microscale phase segregation was observed with a conventional cathode support material during the charging/discharging processes but this was suppressed by the confinement of insulating sulfur into the mesopores of the elastic and flexible nanoporous graphene with a large pore volume of 5.3 mL g(-1). As such, durable three-phase contact was achieved among the solid electrolyte, insulating sulfur, and the electrically conductive carbon. Consequently, the electrochemical performances of the assembled all-solid-state batteries were significantly improved and feasible under the harsh conditions of operation at 353 K, and improved cycling stability as well as the highest specific capacity of 716 mA h per gram of cathode (4.6 mA h cm(-2), 0.2 C) was achieved with high sulfur loading (50 wt %).

However, the electric insulation of elemental sulfur and the high solubility of lithium polysulfides are two intractable obstacles to hinder the success of Li-S batteries. In order to overcome aforementioned issues, a novel strategy combined supercritical CO2 fluid technology and biotemplating method is developed to fabricate Ni(OH)(2) modified porous carbon microspheres as sulfur hosts to ameliorate the electronic conductive of sulfur and enhance simultaneously the physical and chemical absorptions of polysulfides. This elaborately designed Ni(OH)(2)@PYC/S composite cathode exhibits high reversible discharge capacity (1335 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), remarkable cyclic stability (602 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C) and superior rate capability, which is much better than its PYC/S counterpart. These results clearly demonstrate that the advanced porous carbon with good conductivity and the polar Ni(OH)(2) coating layer with strong trapping ability of polysulfides are responsible for the enhanced electrochemical performance.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are attractive in this regard due to their high energy density and the abundance of sulfur, but several hurdles such as poor cycle life and inferior sulfur utilization need to be overcome for them to be commercially viable. Li-S cells with high capacity and long cycle life with a dual-confined flexible cathode configuration by encapsulating sulfur in nitrogen-doped double-shelled hollow carbon spheres followed by graphene wrapping are presented here. Sulfur/polysulfides are effectively immobilized in the cathode through physical confinement by the hollow spheres with porous shells and graphene wrapping as well as chemical binding between heteronitrogen atoms and polysulfides. This rationally designed free-standing nanostructured sulfur cathode provides a well-built 3D carbon conductive network without requiring binders, enabling a high initial discharge capacity of 1360 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of C/5, excellent rate capability of 600 mA h g(-1) at 2 C rate, and sustainable cycling stability for 200 cycles with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency, suggesting its great promise for advanced Li-S batteries.

However, the soluble polysulfides Li2Sx (4 <= x <= 8) produced during the discharge process can cause the so-called "shuttle effect" and lead to low coulombic efficiency and rapid capacity fading of the batteries, which seriously restrict their practical application. Using porous materials as hosts to immobilize the polysulfides is proved to be an effective strategy. In this article, a dual functional cage-like metal-organic framework (Cu-MOF), Cu-TDPAT, combining the Lewis basic sites from the nitrogen atoms of the ligand H(6)TDPAT with the Lewis acidic sites from Cu(II) open metal sites (OMSs), was employed as the sulfur host in a Li-S battery for lithium ions and polysulfide anions (S-x(2-)). In addition, the size of nano-Cu-TDPAT was also optimized by microwave synthesis to reduce the internal resistance of the batteries. The electrochemical test results showed that the optimized Cu-TDPAT material can efficiently confine the polysulfides within the MOF, and the resultant porous S@Cu-TDPAT composite cathode material with the size of 100 nm shows good cycling performance with a reversible capacity of about 745 mA h g(-1) at 1C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)) after 500 cycles, to the best of our knowledge, which is higher than those of all reported S@MOF cathode materials. The DFT calculation and XPS data indicate that the good cycling performance mainly results from the dual functional binding sites (that is, Lewis acid and base sites) in nanoporous Cu-TDPAT, providing the comprehensive and robust interaction with the polysulfides to overcome their dissolution and diffusion into the electrolyte. Clearly, our work provides a good example of designing MOFs with suitable interaction sites for the polysulfides to achieve S@MOF cathode materials with excellent cycling performance by multiple synergistic effects between nanoporous host MOFs and the polysulfides.

In this paper, considering anhydrous N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) has good wetting ability with graphene and its function groups has high binding energies with Li2S, NMP was used as solvent to prepare Li2S/graphene composite. The structure morphology and electrochemical performance of as-prepared Li2S/graphene composite were investigated. Results show that numerous of nano-Li2S affiliate on graphene surface homogeneously. The existence of these nano-Li2S alleviate p-p interaction between graphene sheets, and Li2S/graphene composite exhibits honeycomb-like structure with abundant micropores. Due to this special structure, without extra treatment, the as-prepared Li2S/graphene composite exhibits improved electrochemical performance, such as high columbic efficiency, high energy capacity, a high rate capability, and a low potential barrier.

Tuning the band structure of the metal sulfide provides an opportunity to enhance its catalytic activity, which plays an important role in suppressing the "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in LSBs. Here were present a Co9S8@MoS2 core-shell heterostructure anchored to a carbon nanofiber (Co9S8@MoS2/CNF), developed as an interlayer for suppressing the shuttle effect of LiPSs. The fabricated composite heterostructure is determined to be an effective alternative material that combines the synergistic relationship between chemisorption and electrochemical catalysis. We find that the band structure of the MoS2 shell can be effectively tuned by the Co9S8 core and that the Co9S8@MoS2/CNF can capture the LiPSs, providing excellent catalytic ability to convert LiPSs into Li2S2, with subsequent transformation from Li2S2 to Li2S. Importantly, high capacities of 1002 and 986 mAh g(-1) can be retained after 50 cycles with high-sulfur loadings of 6 and 10 mg cm(-2). Our results highlight the design of an atomic-scale heterostructure as a multifunctional interlayer providing a synergistic relationship between adsorption and catalysis. The net result is an effective retardation of the shuttling of LiPSs and an enhancement of the electrochemical redox reactions of LiPSs. This work shows great promise toward the development of practical applications of LSBs.

Even so, polysulfide shuttles, insulation, and volume expansion of sulfur impede its commercial progress. To suppress these problems, we used electrospinning and self-templating to construct C/Co9S8 hybrid polyhedra-modified carbon nanofibers (denoted as C/Co9S8-C@S fibers) as sulfur hosts. The quasi-metallic polar Co9S8 strongly bonds and locks polysulfides, and the hollow polyhedra provide sulfur storage space. Moreover, the overall nanofiber forms an interconnected conductive network to assist the transmission of Li+/e- and restrain the escape of the sulfur phase to a certain extent. Compared with C/Co9S8 polyhedra and carbon nanofibers, the C/Co9S8-C@S fiber delivers excellent adsorption characteristics for polysulfides. As a Li-S battery cathode, the C/Co9S8-C@S fiber (sulfur content: 87.20 wt%) exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1013.7 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, displaying a stable capacity of 694.9 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles. Additionally, it shows a high specific capacity of 894.7 mAh g-1 at 1C with a capacity decay of -0.116% per cycle over 500 cycles.

The as-developed PVDF//C-MoS(2)interlayer exhibits the polysulfide adsorption and trapping capabilities, which reduces the shuttling effects and also slows down the self-discharge in Li-S batteries. The first composite layer (C-MoS2) on the cathode maximizes the level of lithium polysulfide adsorption owing to the strong dipolar interaction of Mo-S on the polarized surface of polysulfide species. Moreover, the PVDF layer physically traps/capture the remaining polysulfide species with its interconnected microstructure for the reutilization as active material in the cathode. The Li-S batteries based on interlayers deliver the discharge capacity of1086 mAh g(-1)at1 Cwith3.0 mg cm(-2)sulfur loading and show capacity decay of0.04 %per cycle after1500 cycles. In contrast, the Li-S batteries without interlayer merely maintain the discharge capacities of423 mAh g(-1)at1 Cwith3.0 mg cm(-2)sulfur loading and show severe capacity decay (0.12 %) after505cycles. The Li-S batteries also depict the remarkable cyclic performances with as-developed interlayer for high sulfur loading cathodes and efficiently slowdowns the self-discharge even after resting for a long time.

But the low utilization of active materials and serious shuttle phenomenon inhibit its commercialization process. In this work, for the first time, water reducers are reported as multifunctional binders to address the above problems to enhance the performance of LSB. Due to the synthetic actions of the water reducer binder, such as highly dispersing effect and good chemical trapping function, commercial sulfur powders are directly used as cathodes, and much better electrochemical performance compared to using the conventional binder polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was obtained, among which the sulfur cathode with sulfonated melamine formaldehyde (SMF) water reducer binder exhibits a high reversible capacity of 625.5 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C and the cathode with polycarboxylic acid (PC) water reducer binder even demonstrates a high area specific capacity of 5 mA center dot h center dot cm(-2) at high sulfur loading of 5 mg center dot cm(-2). These low-cost water reducers are a promising binder for LSB in the future.

Here a rigorous numerical model is developed to predict the capacity retention of Li/S batteries discharged at different rates by taking into account the polysulfide (PS) shuttling effect for various nanostructured cathodes. In a numerical model, capacity fading of the cell is considered to be affected by the concentration of sulfur dissolved into the electrolyte and deposited on the anode as a Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer. Our approach considers SEI layer formation as the main factor that dominates capacity fading over initial cycles (50 cycles). Equivalent Porosity (EP) is determined for various nanostructures and the model asset structures with smaller EP result in smoother capacity fading over cycling performance. The mean value of percentage error between simulation results and experimental capacity in all analyzed structures is less than 5%, except for mesoporous carbon at high discharge rates (1C). Using simulation results we propose Porous Hollow Carbon cap Nanofiber-Graphene (PHCN-G) as a highly efficient nanostructured cathode with a minimum shuttling effect and >99% capacity retention for long-cycling lifetime batteries.

However, several challenges remain to make Li-S batteries viable, including the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates and pulverization of Li metal anode. Engineering stable electrode-separator interfaces without causing large mass/volume increase of inactive materials and electrolyte uptake is an effective approach to improve the cycling stability of Li-S batteries while maintaining high available energy density. Herein, we report the engineering of a stable electrode-separator interface with an ultrathin conductive polymer nanolayer on the pore walls of both surfaces of the separator via a simple and scalable approach using in-situ vapor-phase polymerization of polypyrrole (PPy) on commercial Celgard separator with only a small increase in overall mass and volume. The inherent hydrophilicity of PPy enables the separator to have enhanced electrolyte uptake, which facilitates homogenous Li+ flux and thus uniform plating and stripping of metallic lithium at the anode side during the charge/discharge processes. Meanwhile, the chemical immobilization effect of PPy suppresses the migration of the soluble polysulfides and improves the stability of the sulfur cathode. We showed that a Li parallel to Li symmetrical cell with the PPy modified separator gave a low and stable overpotential of less than 30 mV for over 250 h' stripping and plating test at 1 mA cm(-2) with a fixed areal capacity of 3 mAh cm(-2), which was significantly better than that using a regular Celgard separator. Using the PPy modified separator, Li-S cell with sulfur/carbon black composite cathode and lithium anode delivered stable cycling for 250 cycles at 0.5 C with a low capacity decay rate of 0.083% per cycle. Even for a Li-S cell with a high-areal-capacity sulfur cathode (4.8 mAh cm(-2)), good cycling stability was achieved. It gave a reversible areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm(-2) after 150 charge/discharge cycles at 0.2 C with 75.6% capacity retention. Besides, the as-achieved separator showed better thermal stability than the bare counterpart. This work offers an alternative approach for achieving a practical Li-S battery toward high energy density and long cycle life through simple and scalable separator-electrode interface engineering without significant increase in volume and mass.

In this work, by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we systematically investigated the potential of a series of doped and defective boron nitride (BN) nanosheets as chemical immobilizers for the soluble Li2Sn species. Our results revealed that the introduction of dopants and defects can enhance the binding strength of Li2Sn species with BN nanosheets due to the strong Li center dot center dot center dot N or S center dot center dot center dot B interaction. In particular, the doped BN nanosheets that can moderately interact with Li2Sn species are shown to exhibit outstanding anchoring effects for Li-S batteries because they can keep a balance between the binding strength and integrity of Li2Sn species. Therefore, by carefully controlling the type of dopants, the inert BN nanosheet can be converted to quite a promising electrode material with high efficiency for Li-S batteries.

Thus, the development of cost-effective and high performing electrodes is considered to be an important technology for the practical aspect. It is quite logical that the porous electrode systems can improve the electrochemical performance of a given battery system. Here, this study benchmarks a new class of electrodes based on double (micro and meso)porous carbon spheres (MMPCs) prepared by a facile soft template method followed by wet chemical etching. The particle size analysis, performed by scanning electron microscopy, shows that the templating agents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide(CTAB), have a distinct effect on the size distribution of carbon particles. Different electrochemical characterizations have been carried out to understand the effect of SDS and CTAB on the electrochemical performance of carbon-sulfur nanocomposite electrode. BET analysis shows that the pore size distribution of the carbon spheres prepared by only the soft template method (MPCs) is mainly in the micropore range, which limits the storage and the dispersive capacity. However, the etched samples (MMPCs) showed better electrochemical performance, such as high initial discharge capacity of 921 mAh g(-1)(sulfur loading similar to 77.2%) with 82.7% capacity retention at the end of 150 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) and an impressive rate capability of 1086 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1).This improved performance could be attributed to the double porous structure of MMPCs. Such a feasible and facile architecture provides a good strategy to prepare other different materials that require better material dispersion and electrode/electrolyte interactions.

In this study, sulfur and CoxS electrocatalyst are deposited on carbon nanotube buckypaper (S/CoxS/BP) by a facile electrodeposition method and are used as a binder-free high-performance cathode for LSBs. Elemental sulfur is deposited on buckypaper by electrooxidation of a polysulfide solution (similar to S-6(2)-). This approach substantially increased the current and time efficiency of sulfur electrochemical deposition on conductive material for LSBs. S/CoxS/BP cathode could deliver an initial discharge capacity as high as 1650 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, which is close to the theoretical capacity of sulfur. At current rate of 0.5 C, the S/CoxS/BP has a capacity of 1420 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle and 715 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with a fading rate of 0.099% per cycle. The high capacity of S/CoxS/BP is attributed to both the homogeneous dispersion of nanosized sulfur within BP and the presence of CoxS catalyst. The sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) pretreatment of BP renders it polarity to bind polysulfides and thus facilitates the good dispersibility of nanosized sulfur within BP. CoxS catalyst accelerates the kinetics of polysulfide conversion and reduces the presence of polysulfide in the cathode, which suppresses the polysulfide diffusion to anode, i.e., the shuttle effect. The mitigation of the active material loss improves not only the capacity but also the cyclability of S/CoxS/BP.

Recently, due to their superior mechanical strength with biodegradability, hemp-fibers are resurfacing as an environmentally friendly engineering material. Meanwhile, lithium-sulfur batteries are receiving substantial attention for the next-generation rechargeable batteries, owing to their high energy density combined with the natural abundance of sulfur. Despite these advantages, sulfur active materials still encompass a number of challenges for practical applications, such as intrinsically low electrical conductivity, dissolution in the electrolyte and limited areal loading. By utilizing hemp-fibers as a scaffold for the sulfur active material, herein we report the fabrication of a hybrid porous carbon architecture that mimics the resource acquisition and transport system of vascular plants. The hemp fiber-derived hybrid electrodes show an exceptionally high sulfur loading of 15.36 mg cm(-2) and display a high areal capacity of 14.8 mA h cm(-2) at 0.1C current rate. We also demonstrate the feasibility of the practical application by fabricating large-area pouch-cells. Furthermore, our operando Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies have revealed the chemisorption mechanism of the hemp hybrid electrode with lithium polysulfide, which enables long cycle life.

To overcome these issues, tremendous effort has been made for exploring efficient host materials and new battery construction. Herein, we propose to prepare high conductivity Ti2O by a molten salt electrochemical synthesis method; the synthesized Ti2O is developed to serve as an advanced host and used as a functional separator modification material for the first time. XPS analysis and DFT calculations verified that Ti2O can chemically anchor polysulfides through the abundant surface vacancies, and its high electronic conductivity can further enhance the redox kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. The cells based on the Ti2O-Super P/S cathode exhibit a high sulfur utilization and superb rate capability (553 mA h g(-1)at 4C). Moreover, the cells assembled with a host-interlayer integrated electrode (2.5 mg cm(-2)) could achieve a low decay rate of 0.04% over 500 cycles at 0.5C. A high areal capacity of 6.8 mA h cm(-2)can be also achieved even under 7.5 mg cm(-2)sulfur loading. Overall, the controllable synthesis and application strategies of Ti2O present a way of regulation and optimization of the electrochemical performance of a Ti-based sulfur host through surface vacancy engineering for advanced Li-S batteries.

Ketjen black particle, which serves as conductive carbon core, was firstly coated by sulfur layer, and then sulfur/carbon particle was wrapped by polythiophene layer through in situ polymerization procedure. The structure, conductive properties, and electrochemical performance of composites with different polymerization times were investigated. Results show that the 10-h composite presents both the highest electronic conductivity of 4.51 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) and the highest ionic conductivity of 8.72 x 10(-12) cm(2) s(-1). Moreover, it also exhibits the best electrochemical performance as the cathode material in Li-S battery. The conducting polythiophene with lithium storage ability contributes to improve the electrochemical activity of sulfur. Besides, due to its coating function, the dissolution loss and the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides are suppressed to a certain extent.

J	Zhang, C; Lin, Y; Liu, J				Zhang, Cheng; Lin, Yue; Liu, Jin			Sulfur double locked by a macro-structural cathode and a solid polymer electrolyte for lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							CARBON COMPOSITE CATHODES; GRAPHENE; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; NANOFIBER; HYBRID; LI2S	Both macro-structural cathode materials and a metal-organic framework (MIL-53(Al)) modified solid polymer electrolyte are used to inhibit polysulfide dissolution and shuttling in all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries. At 80 degrees C, the discharge capacities of 1520 mA h g(-1) in the first cycle at 0.2 C and 325 mA h g(-1) in the 1000th cycle at 4 C are obtained, demonstrating exceptional high rate capability and long-term cycling performance of the batteries. Mechanisms for such an enhancement are investigated by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and thermo-gravimetric analysis techniques. In the EIS spectra there is no semicircle caused by the polysulfide shuttling and reaction at the electrolyte/Li interface, proving that polysulfide dissolution is adequately inhibited. The XPS spectra on the Li anode surface after 10 discharge/charge cycles show that sulfur and polysulfide do not transfer from the cathode to the anode. The -C-S-bond in the original cathode is observed by XPS, indicating that sulfur is linked to macro-structural cathode materials by the thermal treatment. In addition, an intermediate forms during cycling and displays steady electrochemical reversibility. These data indicate that the macro-structural cathode and solid polymer electrolyte play crucial roles in blocking polysulfide dissolution and shuttling, and lead to the outstanding cycling performance of all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, polymer carbonized materials usually suffer from limited electrical conductivity that will finally restrain the battery's electrochemical performance. Herein, in this paper, polyaniline (PANI) hydrogels are firstly synthesized on a template of conductive N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs)viaa solution process. After carbonization and activation treatments, the composite materials reveal a highly porous carbon (HPC) structure interwound by NCNT wires, demonstrating a high specific surface area of 1861 m(2)g(-1)and a high electrical conductivity. After further incorporation of elemental sulfur, the resultant NCNTs@HPC/S cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with a superior initial capacity of 1506 mA h g(-1)at 0.2C, a stable capacity of 613 mA h g(-1)after 250 cycles, and an obviously improved rate performance. This work suggests a feasible and efficient approach to fabricate carbon-based high-performance Li-S battery cathodes.

The fresh Li metal reacts with polysulfide continuously, which aggravates irregular Li plating/stripping behavior and decomposition of organic electrolyte resulting in short cycle life and low Coulombic efficiency. Nature has provided a lot of inspiration for human to realize structural construction and functional integration, as it does to battery design. In this report, learning from the hydrophobic property of natural species, a scaly polysulfiphobic artificial interphase layer are constructed on lithium metal anodes that can repel LiPS through the functional decylphosphonate groups that are proved by in operando XPS with Ar ion sputtering. Moreover, the obtained artificial interphase layer keeps dendrite-free morphology and restrains side reactions during cycling effectively. In situ XRD measurements are employed to demonstrate the inhibiting effect for decomposition of organic electrolyte. The as-obtained LDP-Li anodes exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance with the specific capacity of similar to 1000 mAh g(-1) corresponding to Coulombic efficiency of nearly 99%, which shows great promise for the application of Li-S batteries.

The main obstructions plaguing Li-S batteries associated with the electrical resistivity of sulfur/lithium sulfides, the dissolution of polysulfides in ether-based electrolyte and the large volume variation, result in poor cycling performance and rate capability. Here, we develop a polymer optimized cathode that is polydopamine layer coated on the surface of sulfur loaded hierarchical porous graphitic carbon composites (HPGC-S-PD) by a simple in-situ polymerization method toward the highly suppressed shuttle effect, thus the significantly improved cell performance. Attributed to the superiorities of the structure engineering including the strengthened polysulfide trapping, accelerated ionic conductivity and stable electrode construction, this cathode can deliver an excellent cycling performance over 700 cycles at 1 C, a high areal capacity of 7.25 mAh/cm(2) with raised sulfur loading as high as 5.15 mg/cm(2). Meanwhile, the obtained cathode can work well with a lower E/S ratio compared with the non-coated cell, which suggests the immense possibility for yielding a practically Li-S battery with high energy density based on this electrode architecture. Strikingly, the pouch cell with optimized cathode material can realize an energy density of 272 Wh/kg after 40 cycles at 0.1 C. This rational design of sulfur cathode combining HPGC with polymer coating by a scalable strategy provides a comprehensive understanding of the structural engineering for sulfur cathodes in pursuit of practically high performance Li-S batteries.

Current strategy to migrate these three issues is to physically and/or chemically encapsulate the sulfur into porous carbon host (PCH), which is only suitable for a low S loading cathode. The large volume change during charge-discharge process especially in a thicker electrode with high areal S loading will detach the carbon/Li2S particles apart from each other, resulting in fast capacity decay. Although incorporation of large amount of S into 3D carbon paper (CP) can maintain the electrode integration, it cannot effectively immobilize soluble PS. In this work, we chemically bond the PS to both doped PCH and 3D doped CP current collector to suppress the shuttle reaction of PS, and also maintain the electronic/ionic connection during prolonged cycles. The S, N doped CP/doped PCH/S cathode with high areal sulfur loading of 9.0 mg cm(-2) provide a high capacity of 1013 mA h g(-1) with a slow capacity fading rate of 0.074% per cycle for 300 cycles, presenting one of the best cycling stability at the similar S loading reported to date. Moreover, systematic investigations demonstrated that chemical bonding of PS to CP current collector can more effectively enhance the cycling stability of high sulfur loading cathode, compared to the current method by chemical bonding of PS to PCH. This sulfur cathode by filling a large amount of S/C composites into functionalized CP matrix bring a new and promising direction to realization of high energy lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, a major challenge for this type of battery is their relatively low energy density. Here, we present a freestanding, flexible CNT fiber with high electrical conductivity and applied oxygen plasma-functionalization, which was successfully employed to serve as an effective cathode for Li-S batteries. The electrochemical results obtained from the conducted battery tests showed a decent rate capability and cyclic stability. The cathode delivered a capacity of 1019 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. It accommodated a high sulfur loading of 73% and maintained 47% of the initial capacity after 300 cycles. The demonstrated performance of the fiber cathode provides new insights for the designing and fabrication of high energy density fiber-shaped batteries.

Herein, a CoFe alloy is locked in situ in nitrogen-doped carbon nanocube (denoted as CoFe@NC) as a bifunctional separator modification material for Li-S batteries. The obtained CoFe@NC nanocubes exhibit strong chemisorption and catalytic conversion activity of double polysulfides, leading to the enhanced redox kinetics and the reduced polysulfide shuttle effect for Li-S batteries. As expected, the batteries assembled with CoFe@NC modified separator (CoFe@NC//PP batteries) show high specific capacity and long cycle stability. Specifically, the CoFe@NC//PP batteries exhibit a high initial specific capacity of 1473 mA h g-1 at 0.1C, excellent rate capacity of 604 mA h g-1 at 4C, as well as superior cycle stability with the capacity decay rate of only 0.059% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 1C. Additionally, the satisfactory electrochemical performance can be achieved even in the case of high sulfur loading (6.60 mg cm-2) and low electrolyte (E/S is about 7 mu L mg -1). Therefore, this work provides a reliable reference to develop effective intermetallic compounds with chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Currently, the exploitation of POPs with well-constructed porous frameworks and adequate polar substances is reviewed as an efficient approach. Herein, we provide crosslinked porous polyimides (CR-PPIs) on the basis of traditional polymerization and crosslinking reaction. These materials give adequate space for accommodating LiPSs and relieve shuttle behaviors through the coordinated function of physical confinement (hierarchical micropores) and intense chemisorption anchoring (high-content polar heteroatom N). CR-PPIs composited with carbon nanotubes expedite charge/ ion migration through the valid storage method and transport pathway. Moreover, benefiting from the high-content pyrrolic and pyrrolic N species, S/CR-PPI-PE has superior electrochemical properties between these composites.

However, their development and applications are limited by their low practical energy density and rapid capacity fading. Herein, self-supporting Ti3C2Tx foam, as a novel sulfur host, was synthesized via direct stacking of Ti3C2Tx flakes into film followed by hydrazine-induced foaming. This Ti3C2Tx foam exhibits a well-defined porous structure, increased surface area, enlarged pore volume, and enhanced exposure of Lewis acidic sites, thus effectively strengthening the capability of physical and chemical co-adsorption for polysulfides under a high sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2). Combined with a favorable electrolyte wettability and extraordinary structural stability, the resultant self-supporting Ti3C2Tx foam/S cathodes demonstrated excellent performances: a high initial discharge capacity (1226.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C), exceptional rate performance (711.0 mA h g(-1) at 5C), and extraordinary long-term cycling stability (689.7 mA h g(-1) at 1C after 1000 cycles with ultralow capacity decay of approximate to 0.025% per cycle). Remarkably, the self-supporting structure confers a significantly elevated gravimetric energy density (1297.8 W h kg(-1)). Therefore, this elaborately designed Ti3C2Tx foam/S cathode opens new delightful opportunities for constructing practical high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

Because the infused sulfur is distributed and confined in the three-dimensional, connected carbon network of the porous microsphere, an electrode made of this material shows very high conductivity. In addition, as the synthesized carbon microsphere is polar and a good adsorbent for polar polysulfides, it improves battery performance by reducing loss of sulfur and suppressing the shuttle effect. The battery constructed using this material shows high cell performance with a highly stable capacity at similar to 1000 mAh g(-1) under a charge/discharge current of 0.2C for 200 cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of 100%. After 200 charge/discharge cycles the electrode retains good structural integrity, which is an important cause for the insignificant increase in the ionic and electronic impedances of the battery. Moreover, a simple increase in the sulfur loading of the electrode to 6 mg cm(-2) with the addition of electrolyte in a moderate electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 mu L mg(-1) can effectively achieve a practical areal capacity > 3-4 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1-0.3C.

In Li-S batteries, it delivered a high initial specific capacity of 1473.1 mAh/g at a current density of 200 mA/g, and the capacity retention was even tip to 95.7% over 100 cycles 4 3200 mA/g, i.e., a capacity fade rate of only 0.043% per cycle. These good electrochemical performances should be attributed to, the SnO2@C hollow nanospheres. They can enhance the electronic conductivity by the outside carbon shell, and confine the lithium polysulfides by S-Sn-O and S-C chemical bonds to suppress the shuttle effect. Besides, the hollow nanospheres can readily accommodate the sulfur/sulfides to prevent the electrical/mechanical failure of the cathode, instead of their agglomeration oh the external surface of SnO2@C.

Under its synergistic effect on the polysulfide physical entrapment and its strong chemical adsorption of manganese dioxide on polysulfides, the "shuttle effect" produced by polysulfides is reduced effectively and greatly. In addition, this structure could facilitate the infiltration of the electrolyte, shorten the ion transport path, improve the utilization of the active material, and thereby, exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance. The specific capacity of HPCM/S is still maintained at 665 mA h g(-1) at a high rate of 1.0 C after 1000 cycles and the capacity decay is only 0.033% per cycle. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

When carbonaceous materials being used as cathode for Li-S batteries, the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides coupled with large volume expansion and low electronic and ionic conductivity of solid S-related species has resulted in poor cycle performance and low capacity. In this work, novel sandwich-type carbon/titanium dioxide/carbon (C@TiO2@C) hollow microspheres as a new kind of molecularly designed physical and chemical trap for lithium polysulfides (Li(2)Sx (x = 4-8)) are reported. In such a unique architecture, an interlay TiO2 layer as the carrier for sulfur could effectively confine polysulfides by chemical binding between TiO2 and polysulfides, while the sandwich-type hollow carbon structure could buffer the volume change during the charge-discharge process by means of physical force. Moreover, the inner and outmost carbon layers provide an effective conductive network to improve the electronic conductivity of sulfur cathodes, and at the same time further suppress the dissolution of polysulfides, leading to structural and interfacial stabilization of the TiO2 interlay. Benefiting from the synergistic encapsulation, the developed C@TiO2@C-S hybrid hollow microspheres with 76.4 wt% sulfur content deliver a high specific capacity of 1247.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C with higher coulombic efficiency (approximate to 96%), and retain a discharge capacity of 741.3 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5C and 511 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 2C, which are much better than those of the contrast TiO2-S and C@C-S electrodes.

However, their practical application is still hindered by the shuttle effect and the sluggish conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, monodisperse molybdenum (Mo) nanoparticles embedded onto nitrogen-doped graphene (Mo@N-G) were developed and used as a highly efficient electrocatalyst to enhance LiPS conversion. The weight ratio of the electrocatalyst in the catalyst/sulfur cathode is only 9%. The unfilled d orbitals of oxidized Mo can attract the electrons of LiPS anions and form Mo-S bonds during the electrochemical process, thus facilitating fast conversion of LiPSs. Li-S batteries based on the Mo@N-G/S cathode can exhibit excellent rate performance, large capacity, and superior cycling stability. Moreover, Mo@N-G also plays an important role in room-temperature quasi-solid-state Li-S batteries. These interesting findings suggest the great potential of Mo nanoparticles in building high-performance Li-S batteries.

A quantity of composite examples (e.g., carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal nitrides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, carbon/carbons) are prepared and demonstrated with required properties. These well-designed composites show advantages of large porosity, hierarchical porous structure, high conductivity, tunable components, and proportion. The formation mechanism of versatile carbon composites is attributed to the puffing-carbonization of maltose plus in situ carbothermal reaction between maltose and precursors. As a representative example, Li2S is in situ implanted into a hierarchical porous cross-linked puffed carbon (CPC) matrix to verify its application in lithium-sulfur batteries. The designed S-doped CPC/Li2S cathode shows superior electrochemical performance with higher rate capacity (621 mAh g(-1) at 2 C), smaller polarization and enhanced long-term cycles as compared to other counterparts. The research provides a general way for the construction of multifunctional component-adjustable carbon composites for advanced energy storage and conversion.

However, the shuttling of soluble Li polysulfides (LiPSs) results in self-discharge and rapid capacity degradation. Herein, nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon with embedded highly dispersed vanadium (v)-N-x sites (V-N-C) is developed as a high-performance Li-S battery cathode for the first time. The metal-organic polymer supramolecule structure formed by the electrostatic/hydrogen bond interaction of chitosan-VO3- strongly stabilizes V to generate a high density of V-N-x/C sites. During the discharge/charge process, the unique V-N-x/C active sites can serve as efficient catalysts to accelerate the redox kinetics of LiPSs, while the hierarchical porous carbon structure of V-N-C benefits the diffusion/transfer of Li+/e(-) and suppresses the shuttling of LiPSs. As a result, the S/V-N-C composite delivers a high specific capacity of 1111.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C and maintains 573.6 mA h g(-1) at 5C with a low capacity decay rate of 0.087% per cycle (over 500 cycles at 1C). The rate performance of the developed V-N-C cathode in Li-S batteries is superior to that of most of the reported M-N-C and carbon material/metal compound composite electrodes.

The LBSIP binder exhibits a maximum peeling strength of over 600 mN mm(-1) between the sulfur cathode and aluminum foil, together showing a high lithium ion diffusion coefficient of 2.1 x 10(-12) cm(2) s(-1).Owing to the unique electron-donating groups, the binder can provide a good ionic conductive network and a dramatically enhanced polysulfide-trapping feature. The strong interaction between electron-donating groups of LBSIP with Li2S6 was confirmed by the Li-7-NMR analysis and density-functional theory calculation. The cathode using the LBSIP binder exhibited a high Coulombic efficiency of similar to 100% and an initial specific capacity of 712 mAh g(-1) with a capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. Even at a high current rate of 2 C, a reversible capacity of over 500 mAh g(-1) was still obtained. However, the capacity of the cathode using the PVDF binder decreased to 331 mAh g(-1) after 180 cycles at 0.5 C. This work is very attractive for the rational design of functional binders for Li-S batteries with both ion-transporting and polysulfide-trapping features.

However, it suffers from serious degradation of its reversible capacity because of the dissolution of reaction intermediates, lithium polysulfides, into the electrolyte. To solve this limitation, there are many studies using graphene-based materials due to their excellent mechanical strength and high conductivity. Compared with graphene, graphene oxide (GO) contains various oxygen functional groups, which enhance the reaction with lithium polysulfides. Here, we investigated the positive effect of using GO mixed with carbon black on the performance of cathode in LSB. We have observed a smaller drop of capacity in GO mixed sulfur cathode. We further demonstrate that the mechanistic origin of reversibility improvement, as confirmed through CV and Raman spectra, can be explained by the stabilization of sulfur in lithium polysulfide intermediates by oxygen functional groups of GO to prevent dissolution. Our findings suggest that the use of graphene oxide-based cathode is a promising route to significantly improve the reversibility of current LSB.

Fabrication of Mn/Co-N-C is enabled by using cobalt doped, oxygen vacancy enriched MnO2 (Co-MnO2|O-v) as an initiator for aniline polymerization. The Co-MnO2|O-v initiator can release Co/Mn ions during the polymerization reaction and be used as a metal ion source for the catalyst; the oxygen vacancies can create abundant defects in the carbon structure resulting from pyrolysis of the synthesized polyaniline, which is conducive to increasing Mn/Co loading. The Li-S battery equipped with a Mn/Co-N-C modified separator exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1662 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and 625 mA h g(-1) at 6C. The capacity of 816 mA h g(-1) achieved at 2C decays only 0.036% per cycle after 1000 cycles. At a high sulfur loading of 14.1 mg cm(-2), the battery yields capacities of 798.6 mA h g(-1) and 7.566 mA h cm(-2) at 0.1C, which are retained by 63.9% and 64.7%, respectively, after 110 cycles. DFT calculations reveal that the Mn/Co-N-C catalyst enhances the adsorption capacity and favors electron transfer. This work provides an effective, novel strategy to prepare a highly active Mn/Co-N-C dual-atom catalyst, which shows a good prospect for application in energy storage devices.

These low surface area N-doped biochars were morphologically and physicochemically characterized, and tested as hosting material in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Sulfur/biochars cathodes thus obtained showed good capacity retention and improved Coulombic efficiency compared to a standard N-rich high surface area carbon and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) reference substrates. Such enhanced electrochemical properties are attributable to the better retention of Li polysulfides by means of the residual functionalities still present in the biochars, thus making the valorization of chitosan potentially appealing even in the industrial sector related to the development of energy storage devices.

In this work, metastable marcasite NiSe2 nanodendrites grown on carbon fiber clothes (m-NiSe2/CFC) were synthesized to improve chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic activity towards lithium polysulfides. The multifunctional m-NiSe2/CFC film was utilized as both the interlayer and the three-dimensional (3D) current collector in LSBs. In comparison with the stable pyrite NiSe2 nanodendrite-covered CFC (p-NiSe2/CFC) counterpart, the m-NiSe2/CFC film exhibits even stronger chemisorption, higher catalytic activity and faster reaction kinetics, thereby resulting in significantly improved lithium storage performance. The Al@S/rGO@m-NiSe2/CFC cell has a high reversible capacity of 1646 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, a high Q(L)/Q(H) ratio of 3.00 at 0.2C, a high rate capability of 900 mA h g(-1) at 4C, and an outstanding cyclic stability exhibiting a low capacity decay of 0.028% per cycle for 600 cycles at 4C. Moreover, a symmetrically sandwiched cathode of m-NiSe2/CFC@S/rGO@m-NiSe2/CFC was designed for high sulfur loading LSBs (4.5 mg cm(-2)) with superior electrochemical performance of 3.73 mA h cm(-2) after 100 cycles at 1C rate. Our work opens up a new opportunity to enhance the electrochemical performance of LSBs by phase engineering of NiSe2 catalysts in sandwiched structural cathodes.

However, their practical application is greatly hindered by the notorious shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfide (LPS) intermediates with sluggish redox reactions and uncontrolled precipitation behavior. Herein, we report a semiliquid cathode composed of an active LPS solution/carbon nanofiber (CNF) composite layer, capped with a carbon nanotube (CNT) thin film decorated with metallic Mo nanoclusters that regulate the electrochemical redox reactions of LPS. The trace amount (0.05 mg cm(-2)) of metallic Mo on the CNT film provides sufficient capturing centers for the chemical immobilization of LPS. Together with physical blocking of LPS by the compact CNT film, free diffusion of LPS is significantly restrained and the self-discharge behavior of the Li-S cell is thus effectively suppressed. Importantly, the metallic Mo nanoclusters enable fast catalytic conversion of LPS and regular deposition of lithium sulfide. As a result, the engineered cathode exhibits a high active sulfur utilization (1401 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), stable cycling (500 cycles at 1 C with 0.06% decay per cycle), high rate performance (694 mAh g(-1) at 5 C), and low self-discharge rate (3% after 72 h of rest). Moreover, a high reversible areal capacity of 4.75 mAh cm(-2) is maintained after 100 cycles at 0.2 C for a cathode with a high sulfur loading of 7.64 mg cm(-2). This work provides significant insight into the structural and materials design of an advanced sulfur-based cathode that effectively regulates the electrochemical reactions of sulfur species in high-energy Li-S batteries.

Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with a Block Copolymer Electrolyte Analyzed by X-ray Microtomography	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SALT CONCENTRATION; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; CONDUCTIVITY; CELL	Most of the work on Lithium-sulfur (LiS) batteries use liquid electrolytes that have limited stability when coupled with Li metal anodes. We have studied LiS batteries with a solid block copolymer electrolyte which exhibits improved stability against Li anodes. The electrolyte comprises a polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (SEO) copolymer doped with a Li salt. Hollow carbon nanospheres impregnated with sulfur were used to build a composite cathode. Two types of sulfur-impregnated functionalized carbon nanospheres were used: one with carboxylic acid groups and the other with short lithium poly(4-styrenesulfonyl (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (PSTFSI-Li) chains. Cells with Li2S8 dissolved in the SEO based electrolyte served as the baseline. After cycling, the reason for capacity fade was determined by imaging the batteries using synchrotron hard X-ray microtomography. It is generally assumed that LiS cells fail due to dissolution of polysulfide into the liquid electrolyte, i.e., the main problems related to the cathode. In our all-solid cells, failure was primarily due to delamination of the Li foil from the polymer electrolyte layer. Delamination is also observed at the sulfur cathode. It is likely that the large changes in volume of the active materials during cycling induce delamination in all-solid LiS cells. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

Herein a bilayer cathode consisting of nitrogen sulfur codoped porous carbon network and titanium carbide has been introduced and investigated methodically. The porous sulfur host promotes uninterrupted diffusion of electrolyte and ions whereas titanium carbide acts as polysulfide trapping material. The superiority of this bilayer cathode over the conventional interlayer approach has been highlighted in terms of the diffusivity of lithium ions and the overall ohmic resistance. Variation in interfacial charge transfer resistance during charging and discharging has been investigated using dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Discharge capacity reaches as high as 1300 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C with a Coulombic efficiency of 99%. Theoretical studies reveal that the polar nature and improved interfacial charge transfer between the TiC and polysulfides result in excellent binding strength and faster redox kinetics during operation, respectively. This work provides an experimental as well as theoretical evidence of the bifunctional mechanism of TiC toward polysulfide confinement and conversion.

Sulfiphilic cathode materials with strong affinity for lithium (poly) sulfides are a promising new group of candidates to control dissolution/precipitation reactions in the cell, where the improvement of conductivity and the areal sulfur loading is an important objective. Here we report a metallic Co9S8 material with an interconnected graphene-like nano-architecture that realizes this aim. First-principles calculations coupled with spectroscopic evidence demonstrate the synergistic strong dual-interactions of polysulfides with the host. The three dimensional interconnected structure with hierarchical porosity not only manifests up to a factor of 10 increase of cycling stability (fade < 0.045% per cycle over 1500 cycles at C/2) compared to standard porous carbons but also, more importantly, enables a high-loading sulfur electrode with up to 75 wt% sulfur, and up to 4.5 mg cm(-2) areal sulfur loading.

The proposed superposition design not only affords a large electrode surface area with evenly distributed mesopores for smooth electrolyte accessibility and rapid Li ion diffusion, but also renders interconnected metallic building blocks for efficient electronic transport, while the additional edges function as active sites to stabilize the redox cycling and promote the conversion process. The obtained hybrid sulfur cathodes demonstrate excellent cyclability and high coulombic efficiency due to the enhanced polysulfide intermediate anchoring-conversion capability. Specifically, the Li-S battery based on the optimized PCN/NG hybrid delivered a high reversible capacity of 1236.4 mA h g(-1) and good long-term cycling stability (i.e., 70.4% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.2C). Due to the facile and scalable in situ fabrication strategy, the PCN/NG hybrid can be envisioned as a promising heterostructured sulfur host for Li-S batteries with superior performance.

However, this areal capacity is difficult to achieve due to a major technical issue-the shuttle effect. Nonpolar carbon materials limit the shuttle effect through physical confinement. However, the polar polysulfides (PSs) only provide weak intermolecular interactions (0.1-0.7 eV) with these nonpolar carbon materials. The physically encapsulated PSs inside the nonpolar carbon scaffold eventually diffuses out and starts shuttling. Chemically interactive hosts are more effective at interacting with the PSs due to high binding energies. Herein, a multifunctional separator coating of nitrogen-doped multilayer graphene (NGN) and -SO3- containing Nafion (N-NGN) is used to mitigate PS shuttling and to produce a high areal capacity LSB. The Nafion is used as a binder instead of PVDF to provide an additional advantage of -SO3- to chemically bind the PS. The motive of this research is to investigate the effect of highly electronegative N and -SO3- (N-NGN) in comparison with the -OH, -COOH, and -SO3- groups from a hydroxyl graphene and Nafion composite (N-OHGN) to mitigate PS shuttling in LSBs. The highly conductive doped graphene architecture (N-NGN) provides efficient pathways for both electrons and ions, which accelerates the electrochemical conversion at high sulfur loading. Moreover, the electron-rich pyridine N and -SO3- show strong chemical affinity with the PS through polar-polar interactions, which is proven by the superior electrochemical performance and density functional theory calculations. Further, the N-NGN (5 h) produces a maximum areal capacity of 12.0 and 11.0 mAh cm(-2) , respectively, at 15 and 12 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading. This areal capacity limit is significantly higher than the required areal capacity of LSBs for commercial application, which shows the significant strength of N-NGN as an excellent separator coating for LSBs.

Unfortunately, the high loading of insulating sulfur often leads to low specific capacities, poor rate properties, and rapid capacity loss. To address this challenge, a facile templating route to fabricate a novel host material, hierarchical porous carbon rods constructed by vertically oriented porous graphene-like nanosheets (HPCR) is presented. With a high specific surface area, ultralarge pore volume, hierarchical porous structures, and ideal ion transfer pathways, HPCR is a promising candidate for high sulfur loading. When used as the active material for a sulfur cathode, the HPCR-S composite with 78.9 wt% sulfur exhibits excellent rate performance (646 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) at 5 C) and cycling stability (700 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 C). Even with a sulfur content of 88.8 wt%, the HPCR-S composite, without any additional protective polymer coating, still delivers a good rate performance (545 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) at 3 C) and cycling stability (632 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C). More importantly, the high sulfur loading (88.8 wt%) ensures that the HPCR-S composite has a high energy density (880 mAh cm(cathode)(-3) after 200 cycles at 1 C).

Despite this, the poor electron and lithium ion transportation for Li2S impedes its further development. Herein, a great electron and lithium ion pathway is constructed for Li2S by a facile spray-dried technology. In this composite, the nano-sized Li2S is well imbedded in framework composed by the nitrogen/oxygen dual doped carbon nanotube/carbon (Li2S/CNT/C-N/O). The electrochemical tests show that the prepared Li2S/CNT/C-N/O cathode exhibits great cycling stability and rate capacity. A high initial discharge capacity of 1014 mAh g(-1) is achieved with 671 mAh g(-1) capacity remained at 200 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles. Impressively, a stable capability is still exhibited from 200 to 3000 mA g(-1) during rate testing. In-situ electrochemical impedance spectra test is further used to get insightful understanding about the improvements. The result reveals that decreased resistance and increased lithium-ion diffusion can be achieved for the Li2S/CNT/CN/O, especially at the initial charging stage of polysulfides nucleation, which shed light on the improved reactive kinetics and active material utilization.

Rationally designing S/Ti3C2Tx as a cathode material with an interlayer for high-rate and long-cycle lithium-sulfur batteries	NANOSCALE			English	Article							CARBON NANOSPHERES; PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDES; HOST; LIFE; NANOSHEETS; SEPARATOR; ELECTRODE; ORIGIN; MXENES	Lithium-sulfur batteries suffer from poor cycling stability and inferior rate capability, mainly caused by low conductivity and lithium polysulfide dissolution. To tackle these problems, this work demonstrates that Ti3C2Tx "clay", synthesized by selectively extracting the Al layers from the Ti3AlC2 phases with a mixture of HCl and LiF, is an effective host material for sulfur cathodes. To further enhance the rate performance and cycling stability of S/Ti3C2Tx composites, a single-walled carbon nanotube thin film was prepared by a simple vacuum filtration method and inserted between the cathode and the separator as an interlayer for Li-S batteries. The S/Ti3C2Tx composite with an interlayer could deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1458 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1) and an ultralow capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle at 0.8 A g(-1) for over 1500 cycles was achieved. More importantly, a reversible capacity of 608 mA h g(-1) was obtained at a high current density of 8.2 A g(-1) (approximate to 5C), demonstrating superior rate capability. These results suggest that the S/Ti3C2Tx composite is a promising sulfur cathode material and the introduction of the interlayer will pave the way for the future development and design of high-rate with long-cycle Li-S batteries.

Amine- and Amide-Functionalized Mesoporous Carbons: A Strategy for Improving Sulfur/Host Interactions in Li-S Batteries	BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS			English	Article						Li-S batteries; bromomethylation; high gravimetric energy density; density functional theory; polysulfides	LITHIUM BATTERIES; ELECTROLYTE; CHALLENGES; CATHODE	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are of great interest due to their potentially high energy density, but the low electronic conductivity of both the sulfur (S-8) cathode active material and the final discharge product lithium sulfide (Li2S) require the use of a conductive host. Usually made of relatively hydrophobic carbon, such hosts are typically ill-suited to retain polar discharge products such as the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPs) and the final Li2S. Herein, we propose a route to increase the sulfur utilization by functionalizing the surface of ordered mesoporous carbon CMK3 with polar groups. These derivatized CMK3 materials are made using a simple two-step procedure of bromomethylation and subsequent nucleophilic substitution with amine or amide nucleophiles. We demonstrate that, compared to the unfunctionalized control, these modified CMK3 surfaces have considerably larger binding energies with LiPs and Li2S, which are proposed to aid the electrochemical conversion between S-8 and Li2S by keeping the LiPs species in close proximity to the carbon surface during Li-S battery cycling. As a result, the functionalized cathodes exhibit significantly improved specific capacities relative to their unmodified precursor.	[Fretz, Samuel J.; Palmqvist, Anders E.

However, seldom researches have been done on the relationship between cathode thickness and electrochemical performance. Our work investigates the relation between electrochemical performance and cathode thickness with typical porous carbon materials. We explain the phenomenon that only a modest cathode thickness can have the most adequate electrochemical reaction trend through the aspect of thermodynamics (chemical potential) so that the best electrochemical performance can be obtained. Besides, interlayer can remit the shuttle effect but hinder the lithium ion diffusion process simultaneously. And we verify the effect of interlayer thickness on the shuttle effect and lithium ion diffusion process. (C) 2018 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

J	Yang, JB; Xu, LY; Li, SZ; Peng, C				Yang, Jingbo; Xu, Lingyun; Li, Shizhen; Peng, Chuang			The role of titanium-deficient anatase TiO2 interlayers in boosting lithium-sulfur battery performance: polysulfide trapping, catalysis and enhanced lithium ion transport	NANOSCALE			English	Article							POROUS CARBON; CONVERSION; ELECTRODE; REDOX; HOST	Despite the high theoretical energy density, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are currently facing two major problems, i.e., the shuttle of polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics. Recent research has shown that electrocatalysts such as Pt and CoS2 can catalyze the polysulfide redox reaction and hence improve the kinetics and cycle performance of Li-S batteries. The current work demonstrates that a cheaper, lightweight and green alternative, i.e., titanium-deficient anatase TiO2 (TDAT) not only possesses a strong lithium polysulfide (LiPS) trapping ability via chemical interactions but also catalyzes the sulfur-sulfide redox reaction. Moreover, the TDAT-PE separator also shows high lithium conductivity, fast lithium diffusion, and facile lithium transference. As a result, the Li-S batteries with the TDAT modified PE interlayer show markedly higher sulfur utilization and capacity, rate and cycle performances.

The sulfur-rich copolymer exhibited a reduction in the active material dissolution into the electrolyte and a low self-discharge rate behavior during the rest time compared to an elemental sulfur cathode, indicating the chemical confinement of sulfur units. The presence of organosulfur moieties in copolymer suppress the irreversible deposition of end-discharge products on electrode surfaces and thus improve the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries. This sulfur copolymer offered a reversible capacity of 892 mA h g(-1) at 2nd cycle and maintained the capacity of 528 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) prepared via a sustainable route was used as a conductive filler to extract the better electrochemical performances from this sulfur copolymer. Such sustainable origin batteries prepared via economically viable showed an improved specific capacity of similar to 975 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) current rate with capacity fading of 0.15% per cycle and maintained a stable performance over 500 cycles at 2000 mA g(-1).

As one of the important ingredients in Li-S battery, the binder greatly affects the battery performance. However, the conventional binder has some drawbacks such as poor capability of absorbing hydrophilic lithium polysulfides, resulting in severe capacity decay. In this work, we reported a multi-functional polar binder (AHP) by polymerization of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) with ethylenediamine (EDA) bearing a large amount of amino groups, which were successfully used in electrode preparation with commercial sulfur powder cathodes. The abundant amide groups of the binder endow the cathode with multidimensional chemical bonding interaction with sulfur species within the cathode to inhibit the shuttling effect of polysulfides, while the suitable ductility to buffer volume change. Utilizing these advantageous features, composite C/S cathodes based the binder displayed excellent capacity retention at 0.5 C, 1 C, 1.5 C, and 3 C over 200 cycles. Accompany with commercial binder, AHP may act as an alternative feedstock to open a promising approach for sulfur cathodes in rechargeable lithium battery to achieve commercial application.

In this work, we investigate the electrochemistry of lithium sulfide films ranging in thickness from 30 to 3500 nm. We show that films thicker than approximately 40 nm cannot be charged at local charge densities above 1 mu A cm(-2), and by implication, the maximum useful pore diameter is near 60 nm in a practical cathode. "Activation" overpotentials for Li2S are identified in thicker films, resulting from polysulfide generation, but are shown not to improve the fundamental areal charge limitations. We develop a model for filling of conductive pores with active material to rationally design composites based on local charge density. For low-electrolyte applications, the importance of matching micropore volume to sulfide loading and cycling rate is emphasized.

The [HOOCEMIM][Cl]((IL)) used in the experiment played a crucial role in triggering self-assembly of primary TiO2 nanoparticles. The obtained MS TiO2 material has an excellent porous structure with a large pore volume of 0.792 cm(3) g(-1) and a large specific surface area of 291.08 m(2) g(-1). This unique structure can realize effective contact between host material and lithium polysulfide intermediates, thus promote the adsorption performance chemically. In addition, the 3D mesoporous structure can physically confine the intermediate products to the electrode and also accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur upon cycling. The MS TiO2 and sulfur (MS TiO2-S) composite cathode exhibited superior rate capacity and long term cycling stability than that of the commercial TiO2 and sulfur (C TiO2-S) composite cathode, displaying a very low capacity decay rate of 0.07% per cycle over 300 cycles. Even when the sulfur content of the MS TiO2-S composite is up to 84 wt.%, the capacity decay rate still remains at a relatively low level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the practical application of LSBs is hindered by rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life due to the shuttle effect of dissolved polysulfides. In this study, 3D-hierarchical porous carbon impregnated with sulfur (S@3DC), followed by coating with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), is used as a cathode for LSB. The 3D-hierarchical carbon possesses high porosity with micro/mesopores and an open framework that enables the electrolyte penetration for fast ion/mass transfer. The Li-S cells employing PVP-coated S@3DC cathode depicts excellent cycling stability with a high initial capacity of similar to 1527 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, capacity retention of 80.66% after 800 cycles at 1.5 C, and a remarkable rate capability up to a high rate of 2 C. The thin PVP layer coating, used as a buffer layer on the S@3DC surface, contributes appropriate functional groups at the sulfur-carbon interface. These functional groups enhance sulfur immobilization and suppress the shuttle effect; they also provide additional electrochemically active sites on S@3DC surface for accelerating the charge transfer kinetics between electrode and electrolytes.

However, both the low Coulombic efficiency and severe capacity degradation limits the full utilization of active sulfur, which hinders the practical applications of Li-S battery system. The present study reports a ternary-layered separator with a macroporous polypropylene (PP) matrix layer, graphene oxide (GO) barrier layer, and Nafion retarding layer as the separator for Li-S batteries with high Coulombic efficiency and superior cyclic stability. In the ternary-layered separator, ultrathin layer of GO (0.0032 mg cm(-2), estimated to be around 40 layers) blocks the macropores of PP matrix, and a dense ion selective Nafion layer with a very low loading amount of 0.05 mg cm(-2) is attached as a retarding layer to suppress the crossover of sulfur-containing species. The ternary-layered separators are effective in improving the initial capacity and the Coulombic efficiency of Li-S cells from 969 to 1057 mAh g(-1), and from 80% to over 95% with an LiNO3-free electrolyte, respectively. The capacity degradation is reduced from 0.34% to 0.18% per cycle within 200 cycles when the PP separator is replaced by the ternary-layered separators. This work provides the rational design strategy for multifunctional separators at cell scale to effective utilizing of active sulfur and retarding of polysulfides, which offers the possibility of high energy density Li-S cells with long cycling life.

However, the polysulfide shuttle reaction and low conductivity sulfur cathode limit their engineering applications. Herein, this study presents a facile method to prepare self-assembled composites of porous TiO2 with exposed (001) facets wrapped in graphene sheets for overcoming both obstacles at once. The highly oriented graphene encapsulates the TiO2 microspheres completely, and this composited structure not only reveals that the TiO2 with (001) facets can provide strong adsorption to accelerate polysulfide redox reactions via interfacial activation of Ti sites, but also generates sufficient electrical contact for promoting cell performance under high sulfur loading conditions. As a result, the electrodes (area: 2 cm(2)) with 3.2 and 2.3 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading possess high initial cell capacities of 1100 and 1200 mA h g(-1), and retain 700 and 870 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles under 5.2 mA, respectively. During long term cycling, the cell retains 583 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles at 5.2 mA with 1.8 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading.

However, how to uniformly coat a dense layer of carbon on nano sized Li2S is still challenge so far. Here, we utilized a novel (Towable ionic liquid (1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyana-mide) as a carbon precursor to uniformly coat a dense carbon on Li2S nano-clusters. The carbon coated nano-Li2S cathode displays not only much high active material utilization (826 mAh/g at 0.1 C) due to short lithium ion diffusion distance and low charge transfer resistance, but also long cycling stability (82% of capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C) with near 100% Coulombic efficiency due to encapsulation of the lithium polysulfide within the carbon cage.

The three-layered configuration was fabricated by directly dropping pure sulfur composite slurry into multifunctional dual-barrier layers consisting of a self-standing TiO2/C interlayer and a very thin acetylene black layer (0.35 mg cm(2)). In consequence, a decent discharge capacity of 963 mA h g(-1) was acquired after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. With cycling at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 C, the cells displayed excellent reversible capacities of 1203, 1145, 1035, 934, and 820 mA h g(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the cells still delivered a satisfactory discharge capacity of 799 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. The light mass of the three-layered configuration guarantees that the energy density is effectively improved, considering the overall mass of the cathode. The energy density (603 W h kg(-1) after 100 cycles) was at a high level compared with those of the reported ones. Therefore, it is believed that the synergistic design for the three-layered cathode structure, which combines the mass-produced layer-by-layer structure, provides a novel protocol to the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Solutions to this issue have mostly focused on the design of cathode hosts with a polar, sulfurphilic, conductive network, or the introduction of an extra layer to suppress LIPS shuttling, which either results in complex fabrication procedures or compromises the mechanical flexibility of the device. A robust Ti3C2Tx/S conductive paper combining the excellent conductivity, mechanical strength, and unique chemisorption of LiPSs from MXene nanosheets is reported. Importantly, repeated cycling initiates the in situ formation of a thick sulfate complex layer on the MXene surface, which acts as a protective membrane, effectively suppressing the shuttling of LiPSs and improving the utilization of sulfur. Consequently, the Ti3C2Tx/S paper exhibits a high capacity and an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.014% after 1500 cycles, the lowest value reported for Li-S batteries to date. A robust prototype pouch cell and full cell of Ti3C2Tx/S paper//lithium foil and prelithiated germanium are also demonstrated. The preliminary results show that Ti3C2Tx/S paper holds great promise for future flexible and wearable electronics.

However, their commercialization is still greatly restricted by their poor cycle stability, resulting from the severe shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) during cycling. Herein, we designed a CNT@cationic polymer/rGO (CNT@CP/rGO) blocking layer on a commercial PP separator. Such a blocking layer can strongly fix LiPSs by the electrostatic attraction effect between the cationic polymer backbones and the polysulfide anions. As a result, a Li-S battery equipped with a CNTs@CP/rGO-functionalized separator showed much improved cycling stability with a capacity fading rate as low as 0.06% per cycle during 700 cycles at 1 C. Especially, high areal capacity of 6.3 mAh cm(-2) was also achieved with a high sulfur loading of 8.5 mg cm(-2) after 50 cycles. This work highly emphasizes that the electrostatic attraction mechanism between cationic polymers and polysulfides can effectively restrain the polysulfide shuttling and thus significantly improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

Three solid materials are used: sawdust as a carbon source, urea and/or melamine as a nitrogen source, and potassium carbonate as an activation agent. The resulting nitrogen-doped porous carbons offer a very high specific surface area of up to 3000 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume up to 2 cm(3) g(-1). Also, a high nitrogen content of 4 wt % (urea only) up to 12 wt % (melamine only) is generated, depending on the nitrogen and carbon sources. The mechanochemical reaction and the impact of different wood components on the porosity and surface functionalities are investigated by nitrogen physisorption and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These N-doped carbons are highly suitable as cathode materials for Li-S batteries, showing high initial discharge capacities of up to 1300 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) (95 % coulombic efficiency) and >75 % capacity retention within the first 50 cycles at low electrolyte volume.

Myriad strategies have been adopted to surmount these challenges such as encapsulation of elemental sulfur in carbonaceous materials to enhance conductivity, introduction of modified separators to mitigate the shuttling of polysulfide etc. In the present work, hybrid nanoparticles, barium titanate-grafted-graphene oxide (BaTiO3-g-GO) was prepared by chemically coupling BaTiO3 to graphene oxide (GO) sheets by a solvothermal method. Additionally, biomass-derived activated carbon (AC) obtained from sisal fibres was also prepared. Trilayer membranes (TLM) were prepared by coating BaTiO3-g-GO and AC on either side of the commercially available Celgard 2320 separator. The Li-S cells with AC/BaTiO3-g-GO-coated trilayer permselective membranes delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1450 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and also appreciably suppressed the self-discharge of Li-S cells even after 40 h which opens up the venue for Li-S batteries to achieve long cycle life without self-discharge for multifarious applications.

However, the shuttle effect seriously limits the practical use of Li-S batteries. In this work, we demonstrate cobalt sulfide quantum dot embedded nitrogen/sulfur-doped carbon nanosheets composite material (CoSx QD-NSC) as coating material for commercial polypropylene (PP) separator (celgard 2400) in Li-S batteries. It is able to act as an efficient barrier for the blocking of polysulfides in Li-S batteries. The cell with modified separator, at the sulfur loading of 1.6 mg cm(-2), can exhibit a high initial specific capacity of 1250 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1), with a capacity retention of 73.6% after 100 cycles. When cycled at 1 C (1675 mA g(-1)), the cell can deliver a high initial specific capacity of 874 mAh g(-1) and a reversible specific capacity of nearly 500 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles, exhibiting an average capacity fading of only 0.05% per cycle. The excellent performance is ascribed to the efficient adsorption of the CoSx QD-NSC to polysulfides, which inhibits the shuttle effect in Li-S batteries. The CoSx QD-NSC modified separator in this work provides new insights and opportunities for the development of advanced Li-S batteries. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Hierarchically structured Ti3C2Tx MXene paper for Li-S batteries with high volumetric capacity	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						MXene (Ti3C2Tx); Hierarchical structure; Li-S batteries; High volumetric capacity; Reaction mechanism	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; REDOX KINETICS; IN-SITU; CATHODE; CONVERSION; INTERCALATION; POLYDOPAMINE; MECHANISM; HYBRID	Due to the low density of sulfur and the large portion of carbon-based materials used as conducting network and lithium polysulfide (LiPS) host, the practical volumetric energy density of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries barely rivals the Li-ion batteries. Here, MXene (Ti3C2Tx)-based membrane with unique 3D hierarchical structure, high electronic conductivity, abundent active binding sites, fast ion transport, and high affinity for lithium polysulfides has been developed as a new host material to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. With a density of 2.2 g cm(-3), a MXene-based cathode containing 4.0 mg cm(-2) sulfur delivers a high volumetric capacity of 2.7 Ah cm(-3) after 200 cycles. Based on operando XRD and ex-situ XPS results, we find that the Ti-OH bonds present on the surface of MXene membrane can effectively trigger the LiPS transformation. Furthermore, alpha-S-8, as the stable charge product, is first reported in MXene-based host along with its possible important role in curtailing active mass loss and enhancing cycling capability. Our results reveal that 2D MXene with rationally-designed architecture enable high volumetric capacity Li-S batteries for practical applications.

The optimized rGO/PC possesses micropores with size distribution concentrated around 1.1 nm and plenty of meso/macropores. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area is 480.8 m(2) g(-1), and it possesses impressively large pore volume of 2.14 cm(3) g(-1). On the basis of the synergistic effects of the following main factors: (i) the confined space effect in the hierarchical porous binary carbonaceous matrix; (ii) the anchor effects by strong chemical bonds with codoped N and O atoms; and (iii) the good flexibility and conductivity of rGO, the rGO/PC/S holding 75 wt % S exhibits high performance as Li-S battery cathode. Specific capacity of 1625 mA h g(-1) can be delivered at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g-1), whereas 848 mA h g(-1) can be maintained after 300 cycles at 1 C. Even at high rate of 5 C, 412 mA h g(-1) can be restrained after 1000 cycles.

The positive bending deformation during charge and discharge was monitored at real time. It was found that the positive curvature increased during discharge and reduced during open circuit. The curvature would recover the original state during charge period. As electrochemical reaction proceeds, the electrolyte near positive electrode gradually become yellow and deepened due to polysulfide dissolution of discharge products. Results of surface and section morphology observation on sulfur electrode before and after cycle using scanning electron microscope (SEM) were consistent with curvature changes during cycling and verified the volumetric expansion of sulfur electrode.

Herein, mesoporous Co3S4 hexagonal nanosheets with sulfur-atom vacancy defects (Co3S4-DHS) are synthesized via hydrothermally treating the Co-3(VO4)(2) hexagonal nanosheet parent in the presense of Na2S. The sulfur-atom vacancy defects endow Co3S4-DHS with a significantly enhanced electronic conductivity and superior LiPSs adsorbability. Moreover, the abundant mesoporous textures of Co3S4-DHS help to maximize the exposure of catalytically active sites toward LiPSs conversion and buffer the negative effects of large volume fluctuation of loaded sulfur during cycling. Benefiting from these aspects, the Li-S batteries employing Co3S4-DHS/S-based cathodes exhibit a reversible specific capacity of 1090 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and 750 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, as well as a high capacity of 699 mA h g(-1) after 400 charge-discharge cycles at 0.1 C, corresponding to a low capacity fade rate of 0.17% per cycle. This work enriches the way to fabricate defect-rich transition metal sulfides as efficient sulfur host materials for high-rate, long-lifespan rechargeable Li-S batteries.

However, the cycle life of coarse Li2S particles suffers from poor electronic conductivity and polysulfide shuttling. Here, we develop a flexible slurryless nano-Li2S/reduced graphene oxide cathode paper (nano-Li2S/rGO paper) by simple drop-coating. The Li2S/rGO paper can be directly used as a free-standing and binder-free cathode without metal substrate, which leads to significant weight savings. It shows excellent rate capability (up to 7 degrees C) and cycle life in coin cell tests due to the high electron conductivity, flexibility, and strong solvent absorbency of rGO paper. The Li2S particles that precipitate out of the solvent on rGO have diameters 2550 nm, which is in contrast to the 35 mu m coarse Li2S particles without rGO.

While conventional wisdom emphasizes on the search for better catalysts, very few studies have considered the effect of S/Li2S2/Li2S solid deposition on the catalyst surface during battery operation. The accumulation of S/Li2S2/Li2S solid deposits on the catalyst surface can lead to progressive catalyst deactivation. This study shows how solid deposition can be minimized by tuning the electrolyte with electrolyte additives for a more sustained catalysis of the polysulfide conversion reactions. Specifically, a toluene and phosphorus pentasulfide-modified electrolyte is used to sweep the solid deposits from catalyst surface, so that the catalyst surface can be refreshed throughout the battery charge-discharge process. The surface rejuvenation effect was applied to further improve a newly developed high performance bimetallic Fe-N and Co-N co-doped carbon polysulfide catalyst; enabling sulfur cathodes with very high initial sulfur utilization (94%) and long cycle stability (2000 cycles with 67% capacity retention at 2C).

A high specific BET surface area (2741m(2)g(-1)), large specific pore volume (1.23cm(3)g(-1)), and well-controlled pore size distribution (0.6-5.0nm) were obtained and up to 65wt% sulfur content could be loaded into the pores of the BPC-700 sample. When the resultant C/S composite, BPC-700-S65, was used as the cathode of a Li-S battery, a large initial discharge capacity (ca.1200mAhg(-1)) was obtained, indicating a good sulfur utilization rate. An excellent discharge capacity (590mAhg(-1)) was also achieved for BPC-700-S65 at the high current rate of 4C (12.72mAcm(-2)), showing its extremely high rate capability. A reversible capacity of about 570mAhg(-1) was achieved for BPC-700-S65 after 500 cycles at 1C (3.18mAcm(-2)), indicating an outstanding cycling stability.

All the conductive materials for the separator surface decoration can inhibit the migration of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte and decrease the polarization of the sulfur cathode. Thus, the shuttle effect and redistribution of the active material can be suppressed during the charge/discharge process, resulting in enhanced performance. Moreover, the adsorption effect of PPy to lithium polysulfides is stronger compared to that of rGO, and the wettability of the PPy modified separators towards the electrolyte is much better, resulting in further enhanced electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. Particularly, with approximately 2.5-3 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading, the Li-S battery using the PPy nanotube modified separator displays an initial discharge capacity of 1110.4 mA h g(-1), and a retained capacity of 801.6 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5C, demonstrating an average coulombic efficiency up to 90.6% in the LiNO3-free electrolyte.

Nevertheless, issues such as uncontrollable growth of Li dendrites, large volume changes, high chemical reactivity, and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) hinder its rapid development and practical application. Herein a stable and dendrite-free Li-metal anode is obtained by designing a flexible and freestanding MXene/COF framework for metallic Li. COF-LZU1 microspheres are distributed among the MXene film framework. Lithiophilic COF-LZU1 microspheres as nucleation seeds can promote uniform Li nucleation by homogenizing the Li+ flux and lowering the nucleation barrier, finally resulting in dense and dendrite-free U deposition. Under the regulation of the COF-LZU1 seeds, the Coulombic efficiency of the MXene/COF-LZU1 framework and electrochemical stability of corresponding symmetric cells are obviously enhanced. Li-S full cells with the modified Li-metal anode and sulfurizecl polyacrylonitrile (S@PAN) cathode also exhibited a superior electrochemical performance.

Dual-Functional Multichannel Carbon Framework Embedded with CoS2 Nanoparticles: Promoting the Phase Transformation for High-Loading Li-S Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; electrochemical catalyst; cobalt sulfides; high-loading electrode; X-ray adsorption near-edge structure	ELEMENTAL SULFUR; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; SUPPRESSION; LINO3	Lithium-sulfur batteries have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity and low cost. They go through complicated multistep electrochemical reactions from solid (sulfur)-liquid (soluble polysulfide) to liquid (soluble polysulfide)-solid (Li2S) during the discharge process. Actually, during this process, the transition from liquid phase (Li2S4) to solid phase (Li2S) at 2.1 V plateau is a difficult step with sluggish kinetics, thus leading to low sulfur utilization and discharge capacity. To promote the transition processes and enhance the sulfur utilization, CoS2@multichannel carbon nanofiber composites (CoS(2)gMCNFs) serving as sulfur host were successfully synthesized. Herein, CoS2 catalysts are proven to be beneficial not only for enhancing the phase-transition kinetics but also for adsorbing soluble polysulfide. Besides, unlike other carbon materials, MCNFs have plenty of hollow channels and thus enhance sulfur loading and conductivity. Accordingly, the discharge capacity increases 32% more than that of electrode without CoS2. And a very low capacity fade rate of 0.03% per cycle (over 450 cycles) is obtained at a 0.5C rate. This work has opened up new ideas for enhancing sulfur utilization for high sulfur-loading electrode.

Herein, nickel cobalt alloy (NiCo) and nickel cobalt sulfides (NiCoS) have been simultaneously constructed on the nitrogen-doped carbon substrate (NiCo-NiCoS/NC) via facile calcination-sulfurization of NiCo Prussian blue analogue (NiCo-PBA). The abundantly exposed NiCo alloy and NiCoS domains act as adsorption and catalytic sites that enable effective capture and catalytic conversion of polysulfides, and the highly conductive NiCoNiCoS integrated with N-doped carbon provides a facile Li+ transfer channel. As a result, S@NiCo-NiCoS/NC electrode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1345.1 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 C, superior rate capability of 692.1 mA h g(-1) up to 5 C, and ultralong lifespan over 1500 cycles with a small capacity decay of 0.055% per cycle at the current density of 1.0 C.

However, the shuttle effect and the irreversible deposition of Li2S result in severe capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, we discovered that the transition metal phosphides cannot only trap the soluble polysulfides but also effectively catalyze the decomposition of Li2S to improve the utilization of active materials. Compared with the cathodes without transition metal phosphides, the cathodes based on Ni2P, Co2P, and Fe2P all exhibit higher reversible capacity and improved cycling performance. The Ni2P-added electrode delivers capacities of 1165, 1024, 912, 870, and 812 mAh g(-1) at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 C, respectively, and high capacity retention of 96% after 300 cycles at 0.2 C. Even with a high sulfur mass loading of 3.4 mg cm(-2), the capacity retention remains 90.3% after 400 cycles at 0.5 C. Both density functional theory calculations and electrochemical tests reveal that the transition metal phosphides show higher adsorption energies and lower dissociation energies of Li2S than those of carbon materials.

Sway of MnO(2)with poly(acrylonitrile) in the sulfur-based electrode for lithium-sulfur batteries	POLYMER BULLETIN			English	Article						Poly(acrylonitrile); Metal oxide; Cathode; Sulfur battery	CATHODE MATERIAL; POLYACRYLONITRILE/GRAPHENE COMPOSITE; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; MESOPOROUS CARBON; PERFORMANCE; NANOCOMPOSITES; DISCHARGE; HYBRID	Lithium-sulfur batteries have achieved a vast development in electric vehicles, laptops and portable devices. Sulfur has theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh g(-1)and high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg(-1). The sulfur-based cathode material has been prepared by solid-state reaction method. The composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, RAMAN and electrochemical measurements. The as-prepared cathode material exhibits an initial capacity of 1285 mAh g(-1)at a scan rate of 0.1 C. The metal oxide MnO(2)suppresses the polysulfide shuttle and maintains the capacity of the electrode. The porous nature of polymer matrix could confine the sulfur in the pores to prevent the active material loss.

Herein, we present a novel spring-shaped composite in which the sulfur is coated on helix-structured SiO2@hydrogel nanowires. The helix composite provides a buffer space for the volume-change of sulfur during charge and discharge; and the hydrogel polyaniline (PANI) coating improves the conductivity of the electrode and enables interaction with sulfides which is demonstrated by first-principle modelling. The prepared SiO2@C@PANI/S nanowires exhibit a stable capacity of 940 mAh g(-1) after 120 cycles at a rate of 0.1C, along with a good Coulombic efficiency of 99.8%. The nanowires-based cathode also shows a high rate-performance even after three rounds of repeated measurements. The high performance and the general preparation method would enable the composite to be able to find significant applications for electrochemical energy-storage.

At the molecular level, suppressing the shuttle effect has been greatly required for high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, we propose a new strategy by utilizing a protonated organic absorbent (N-1,N-4-bis(pyridine-3-ylmethyl)butane-1,4-diammonium nitrate ([H2PBD](2+)center dot(NO3)(2)(2-)) for ultrafast absorption of polysulfides through electrostatic attractions and for fixing the polysulfides in the cathode by hydrogen-bond interactions. A lithium-sulfur battery cathode based on a commercial carbon black (CB) and an absorbent (10%) with high sulfur content (70%) exhibits a low capacity decay of 0.099% per cycle over 400 cycles at a rate of 0.5C along with 91% Coulombic efficiency. This strategy and the finding of an electrostatic absorbent offer a new alternative insight into designing cheaper lithium-sulfur batteries for their practical application in the future.

While the large volumetric change of sulfur and shuttle effect restrict its development.

The Fe3O4 @S cathode shows a capacity 457 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles, and a 99% Coulombic efficiency. In addi-tion, rate-performance after three rounds delivers stable capacities after repeated measurements. The electro-chemical performance is ascribed to the one-dimensional nano-chain structure provides fast pathways for electron transportation, and accommodates volumetric change of sulfur in charge-discharge.

Carbon Wrapping Effect on Sulfur/Polyacrylonitrile Composite Cathode Materials for Lithium Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Li-Sulfur Battery; Cathode; PAN; Acetylene Black	POROUS CARBON; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; ACTIVATED CARBON; PERFORMANCE; NANOTUBES; GRAPHENE; POLYACRYLONITRILE; ELECTRODES; HYBRID	A sulfur-Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-acetylene black (AB) composite was synthesized via thermal treatment processes. The as-prepared ternary composite was characterized by expending transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and electrochemical investigations. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the formation of PAN layer, which can keep a tight contact between carbon and sulfur which leads to improve the conductivity. Moreover, the PAN can also act as a flexible cushion to accommodate volume changes of sulfur cathode as well as a barrier to trap soluble polysulfide intermediates during the charge-discharge process. The PAN-S-AB composite exhibits discharge capacity of 620 mAh/g even after 50 cycles with appreciable sustainability. Therefore, the resulting PAN/S/AB composite exhibited as a desirable cathode material for Li-S battery with great performance.

However, the insulating nature and undesirable shuttle effect of sulfur species dramatically impede their practical applications. Herein, a unique 3D porous Ti3C2Tx MXene/rGO (MX/G) hybrid aerogel is rationally designed and applied for the first time as a free-standing polysulfide reservoir to improve the overall performance of Li-S batteries. In this strategy, highly conductive MXene and rGO are integrated into a 3D interconnected porous aerogel structure with efficient 2D polar adsorption interfaces, enabling fast Li+/electron transport and strong chemical anchoring of lithium polysulfides as well as enhanced redox reaction kinetics. The robust MX/G aerogel electrodes deliver excellent electrochemical performances including a high capacity of 1270 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, an extended cycling life up to 500 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.07% per cycle, and a high areal capacity of 5.27 mA h cm(-2).

However, it causes multiple problems, including a strong "shuttle effect" during both the cycle and storage process, and limited sulfur utilization. Herein, we develop a Na2Ti6O13 (NTO) nanowire array as a multifunctional sulfur host to simultaneously tackle both the above problems. The synergistic coordination between Na and Ti cations in NTO can accelerate the conversion of soluble polysulfides (PSs) to insoluble sulfides and significantly enhance their adsorption. Therefore, accumulation of PSs, which is the primary cause of the "shuttle effect", can be avoided in two ways. One is fast conversion kinetics during cycles; another is strong PS adsorption, which can suppress the disproportionation of PSs during storage. The as-prepared array represents an easy-to-infiltrate structure with efficient electron transport that allows good wetting ability of the conductive surface toward the electrolyte. Therefore, it helps improve sulfur utilization that is mainly limited by the presence of unwetted conductive surface. Consequently, NTO/sulfur array cathodes exhibit high sulfur utilization and extended cycleand shelf-lives at a low E/S (5:1). Our work suggests that array materials featuring cooperative multi-ion adsorption sites are promising hosts for LSBs.

However, the shuttle effect from lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the sluggish redox kinetics are the main obstacles hindering LSBs' commercialization. In this study, an efficient host material to adsorb LiPSs and regulate their redox conversion was designed. Nano-rod iron hydroxide/electrochemical exfoliated graphene (FeOOH/EG) composites were synthesized by a traditional hydrothermal method. After ball-milling and annealing with modified sulfur, the FeOOH/EG-S composite presents that the sulfur particle is surrounded by FeOOH/EG sheets. As evidenced by XPS results, the FeOOH/EG composite provides strong chemical bonding towards LiPSs with Fe-S, Li-O and S-C bonds. Potentiostatic discharging tests demonstrated that FeOOH/EG promotes the precipitation of solid-state Li2S. First-principle (DFT) calculations revealed that LiPSs are adsorbed by FeOOH within a range of adsorption energies from -1.07 eV to -5.7 eV, indicating that FeOOH has favourable affinity towards polysulfides. Meanwhile, the low diffusion energy barrier (0.07 eV and 0.11 eV) enables the fast diffusion of LiPSs across FeOOH, enhancing the redox reaction kinetics during the charge/discharge process. As a result, the prepared FeOOH/EG-S electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 1323 mA h g(-1)at a current density of 0.1C. After charging/discharging for 500 cycles at a current density of 2C, the FeOOH/EG-S electrode displays a capacity of 733 mA h g(-1), which shows a low capacity decay rate of similar to 0.027% per cycle. This work will be quite inspiring to promote the commercialization of LSBs.

Quite interestingly, when Li and S are caged in a heavily nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NDRGO) matrix derived from Tassar silk cocoon, the composite (NDRGO-Li-S) electrode behaves like a supercapacitor. In this work, we first optimized the concentrations of sulfur and then introduced molybdenum in the NDRGO matrix to develop a stable NDRGO-Mo-Li-2S (where 2 stands for 2M) composite electrode. The electrode design process utilized the concepts of "embedded redox couples" and "induced electron transfer"; a putative strategy to alter internal electron-shuttling kinetics for applications in various charge storage devices; where a time of electron-shuttling is the key. In NDRGO-Mo-Li-2S composite the charge transport occurs via "induced electron transfer," where Li+, is an external oxidant, provoking the inter atom electron transfer between Mo(VI), the internal oxidant, and S(-II), the internal reductant in Mo-S redox couple. This redox reaction is reversed using NDRGO, an external reductant inducing inter atom electron flow across [Mo(V)-(S2)] to complete the starting to product and back cycle. Such a redox cycle is competent for the flow of electrons in a lasting charge storage material through this unique bio-inorganic hybrid approach.

Herein, we demonstrate the strong potential of a commercially available, environmentally friendly, water-soluble linear polyethylenimine (PEI) as a superior bifunctional binder for high-sulfur loading cathodes in Li-S batteries. Our investigation shows the significantly improved cathode performance with enhanced sulfur utilization (i.e., higher capacity), reduced capacity decay, and longer cycling life upon the use of PEI as the binder, relative to the traditional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. This arises from the significantly stronger binding strength and valuable polysulfide trapping ability of the linear PEI binder. In particular, its superior polysulfide adsorption capability has been evidenced experimentally with both ex situ and in situ studies, as well as through theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At a sulfur loading of 2.4 mg cm(-2), the capacity decay rate of the cathode with the linear PEI binder is reduced to as low as 0.042% per cycle over 500 cycles at 2 C. In addition, it also enables the fabrication of high sulfur-loading cathodes (as high as 6.5 mg cm(-2)) with high areal capacity (ca. 4.5 mAh cm(-2)) and high cycling stability. With its superior performance, linear PEI is promising for fabricating high-sulfur-loading cathodes of significantly lowered capacity decay for practical applications.

Here, an integrated sulfurcontaining cathode (S cathode) with modified gamma-MnO2 as the sulfur host is fabricated to address the capacity decline during cycling. When coupled with pre-lithiation and molybdenum doping, the electronic and ionic conductivity of the modified gamma-MnO2 host is enhanced, which reduces the cycling voltage hysteresis of the S cathode. The modified gamma-MnO2 shows strong chemisorption with the intermediate polysulfides that are generated unavoidably during lithium ions intercalation/deintercalation of a S cathode, and presents role of electrochemical catalysis for discharge/charge process to accelerate the redox kinetics of the polysulfides. Consequently, the prepared S cathode demonstrates highly enhanced performance, with an initial specific capacity of 1441 mAh g-1 at a rate of 0.1C, and a maximum areal capacity of 5.37 mAh cm-2 with sulfur loading of 5.8 mg cm-2. The cycling stability is superior with a capacity retention of 617.2 mAh g-1 at 2C after 500 cycles, and good rate capability is also achieved. This S cathode offers a potential alternative for high-performance lithiumsulfur batteries.

These composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetry (TG). The results show that sulfur was thoroughly enveloped by functionalized water-soluble phenyl sulfonated graphene, providing a conductive coating for electron transport and functional groups that interact strongly with polysulfides or sulfur to improve trapping. In our study, we found that large amounts of conductive carbon additives and binders were not required when the electrodes were prepared on carbon-coated aluminum foil substrates because phenyl sulfonated graphene has excellent electrical conductivity, and contains functional groups that interact strongly with carbon and sulfur. The electrochemical tests show that the binder-free PhSO3-RG/S electrodes have high reversible capacity, good cycling stability at the current density of 0.2 C, and excellent rate capability.

As a desirable sulfur host, it should possess high surface area, good electronic conductivity, and superior physisorption and chemisorption to polysulfides. Here, by taking advantage of the magnesiothermic denitriding technology, the graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) with a tunable nitrogen content, surface area, and pore volume has been designed as a sulfur host for high-performance Li-S batteries. With a nitrogen content of similar to 6%, a surface area of 594 m(2) g(-1), and a pore volume of about 2 cm(3) g(-1), the GCN-based host can retain sulfur and allow its reversible convention within cathodic region, thereby delivering a high capacity of 852.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C with a low capacity decay of 0.12% per cycle within 300 cycles. This work provides a feasible way to design nitrogen-doped carbon materials with tunable nitrogen content and enlightens the host material design for practical Li-S batteries.

The 3D carbonized BC (CBC) with highly interconnected nanofibrous structure exhibits good electrical conductivity and mechanical stability. The intrinsic macroporous structure of CBC contributes to a high sulfur loading of 81 wt%. Microstructure and morphology characterization results demonstrate that the sulfur species wrapped around CBC nanofibers are well dispersed. Even at such a high loading, the S/CBC composite still contains sufficient free space to accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur during lithiation. Furthermore, with an ultralight CBC interlayer inserted between the sulfur cathode and separator, significant improvement is achieved in active material utilization, cycling stability, and coulombic efficiency. The CBC interlayer can provide an extra conductive framework and adsorb migrating polysulfides to a certain degree. The CBC interlayer can also act as an additional collector for sulfur and thus could prevent the over-aggregation of insulated sulfur on the cathode surface. The good electrochemical performance reported in this work can be ascribed to the flexible 3D-interconnected nanostructure of the carbon framework and the rational design of battery configuration.

The top and bottom highly conductive MWCNT interfaces are able to physically inhibit polysulfide diffusion and effectively reutilize the trapped active material during cycling. The inserted ultrathin GO layer with negatively charged carboxyl groups, on the other hand, electrostatically repels the migrating polysulfide anions. The stacked GO sheets also extensively prolong the migration routes of the polysulfides. Additionally, the "buffer zones" interspersed within the triple-interface accommodate the migrating polysulfides. Thus, the sandwiched separators enable Li-S cells with a high-sulfur-loading (10 mg cm(-2)), high areal capacity (10.9 mA h cm(-2)), and stable cycling ability even though the coating layer is ultra-thin (similar to 17 mu m) and light-weight (similar to 0.23 mg cm(-2)).

Low Temperature Sulfur Deposition for High-Performance Lithium/Sulfur Cells	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							GRAPHENE OXIDE; PARTICLES; BROMIDE	Sulfur deposition is an effective method for creating composites of sulfur with various conductive materials. In this study we investigated the details of the deposition process of sulfur onto graphene oxide (GO). It was revealed that just mixing a polysulfide solution and a GO suspension resulted in the deposition of sulfur onto the GO under alkaline conditions. The combination of the alkaline deposition and subsequent acidic deposition at different temperatures yielded materials with various morphologies. The sulfur deposition rate influenced the morphology of the S deposit and the resulting Li/S cell performance. By controlling the process with a moderate time for the alkaline deposition and subsequent acidic deposition at a decreased temperature, a preferred morphology of the sulfur/GO composite with a high sulfur utilization was successfully synthesized. This preferred morphology of SGO provides for a high-performance Li/S cell. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

However, realizing the stable cycling of a sulfur cathode with good discharging/charging rate capability under high sulfur content and high sulfur loading conditions remains a major challenge. Confining the dissolvable lithium polysulfide intermediates while addressing the intrinsic low electrical conductivity of sulfur is a key approach toward solving the problem. This work presents the design of a pomegranate-structured sulfur cathode material with high electrochemical performance. To synthesize the material, mesoporous carbon particles with ferrocene decoration are infiltrated with sulfur and then wrapped into secondary particles by dendrimer-linked graphene oxide. In the designed structure, the mesoporous carbon serves as a conductive matrix and porous host for sulfur species; ferrocene provides polar sites to bind lithium polysulfides chemically; the dendrimer-linked graphene oxide encapsulation layers further confine leaching of polysulfides and ferrocene into the electrolyte. With the three components providing triple confinement of the polysulfides, the material with a high sulfur content of 75.7 wt% exhibits excellent cycling stability and good rate capability. A capacity of 826 mA h g(-1) can be delivered at 1.0C with an average decay of only 0.010% per cycle over 1200 cycles. With a high S mass loading of 4 mg cm(-2), the cathode can still be cycled at 0.5C for 300 cycles with a capacity decay as low as 0.038% per cycle.

To overcome these limitations and enable the fabrication of robust LSBs, here the use of a Mott-Schottky catalyst based on bimetallic phosphide CoFeP nanocrystals supported on carbon nitride tubular nanostructures as sulfur hosts is proposed. Theoretical calculations and experimental data confirm that CoFeP@CN composites are characterized by a suitable electronic structure and charge rearrangement that allows them to act as a Mott-Schottky catalyst to accelerate LiPS conversion. In addition, the tubular geometry of CoFeP@CN composites facilitates the diffusion of Li ions, accommodates volume change during the reaction, and offers abundant lithiophilic/sulfiphilic sites to effectively trap soluble LiPS. Therefore, S@CoFeP@CN electrodes deliver a superior rate performance of 630 mAh g(-1) at 5 C, and remarkable cycling stability with 90.44% capacity retention over 700 cycles. Coin cells with high sulfur loading, 4.1 mg cm(-2), and pouch cells with 0.1 Ah capacities are further produced to validate their superior cycling stability. In addition, it is demonstrated here that CoFeP@CN hosts greatly alleviate the often overlooked issues of low energy efficiency and serious self-discharging in LSBs.

Nevertheless, limited by its intrinsic drawbacks of highly insulating character, serious shuttle effect and lithium dendrites growth, there is still a long way from large-scale application of LSBs. Here, a polyacrylonitrile@metal organic frameworks (PAN@MOFs) composite-derived heteroatoms doped carbon@encapsulated CoS2 nanoparticles (NSPCFS@CoS2) modified separator is designed to surmount these issues. Notably, the modified separator shows improved flame retardancy. By using this separator, the effective suppression on shuttle behavior as well as boost in polysulfides conversion kinetics are realized, which can be assigned to the integrative superiorities of conductive carbon fiber network, electrocatalytic activity, polar-polar interaction and Lewis acid-base interaction. The cell with modified separator shows an initial discharge capacity of 1140.7 mAh g-1. After running for 100 cycles, a high capacity of 631.6 mAh g-1 is retained. Notably, the inhibited growth of lithium dendrites is also obtained, indicating the promoted battery safety. Overall, this work may provide useful inspirations for the utilization of MOFs-derived hierarchical composite in implementing safer high-performance LSBs.

However, such notions are based solely on demonstrations of improved cyclic performances, and specific evidence to prove the utilization of the pores is yet to be found. Herein, we report, for the first time, the evidence for gradual activation of micropore-confined sulfur within porous carbon structures. By systematic comparison of rnicroporous and hierarchical porous structures, we show that at sufficiently low current, sulfur infused hierarchical porous structures display a slowly activated and reversible reaction at 1.75 V vs Li/Li+ during discharge. This is in addition to the conventionally reported two voltage plateau at 2.3 and 2.1 V. Furthermore, the effects of LiNO3 decomposition on the system and the electrochemical mechanism behind the activation process is elucidated. Overall, the findings supplement the currently known electrochemical mechanisms occurring within porous structures and pave the way for more efficient utilization of hierarchical porous structures for applications in Li-S batteries.

Adsorbents for sulfide species are favorably applied to the cathode, but this substrate often results in a surface-passivating lithium sulfide(Li2S) film with a strong adsorption of Li2S. Here, an amorphous titanium suboxide (a-TiOx) is presented that strongly adsorbs lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx, x < 6) but relatively weakly adsorbs to Li2S. With these characteristics, the a-TiOx achieves high conversion of Li2Sx and high sulfur utilization accompanying the growth of particulate Li2S. The DFT calculations present a mechanism for particulate growth driven by the promoted diffusion and favorable clustering of Li2S. The a-TiOx-coated carbon nanotube-assembled film (CNTF) cathode substrate cell achieves a high discharge capacity equivalent to 90% sulfur utilization at 0.2 C. The cell also delivers a high capacity of 850 mAh g(-1) even at the ultra-high-speed of 10 C and also exhibits high stability of capacity loss of 0.0226% per cycle up to 500 cycles. The a-TiOx/CNTF is stacked to achieve a high loading of 7.5 mg S cm(-2), achieving a practical areal capacity of 10.1 mAh cm(-2).

We report herein a systematic study of the influence of S-loading process on C-S interactions in MWCNT/S composites prepared by three commonly used industry-friendly methods, namely, mechanical solid-state mixing, infiltration method from a solution of S in CS, and chemical deposition by disproportionation reaction of sodium sulfide and sodium thiosulfate. FESEM and TEM studies reveal strikingly different morphologies of the resulting MWCNT/S composites. XPS and Raman studies indicate different extents of recovery of bonds in MWCNT due to varying degrees of C-S interfacial interactions in the composites. Furthermore, it is found that the C/O atomic ratio in the composites plays a crucial role: the higher the C/O value the better is the S-confinement. These subtle physical changes induced by C-S interactions in the composites can be related to electrochemical performance when tested in Li-S coin cells. It is found that the best results (high initial capacity of 1143 mAh g and better capacity retention) could be achieved when the solution infiltration method was used for S-loading. This conclusion is further validated by using activated carbon as S-host. SYNOPSIS MWCNT/sulfur composites with different S-loading methods have been investigated by XPS and Raman studies. The electrochemical performance in Li-S battery is correlated with different degrees of recovery of bonds in MWCNT and the C/O atomic ratio in the composites due to a varying extent of C-S interactions.

Ceramic conversion followed by silica removal and high-temperature chlorine treatment yields CDCs with a hierarchical micro-mesopore arrangement. This new type of polymer-based CDC is characterized by specific surface areas as high as 2700 m(2) g(-1), coupled withultrahigh micro- and mesopore volumes up to 2.6 cm(3) g(-1). The relationship between synthesis conditions and the properties of the resulting carbon materials is described in detail, allowing precise control of the properties of DUT-70. Since the hierarchical pore system ensures both efficient mass transfer and high capacities, the novel CDC shows outstanding performance as an electrode material in electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) with specific capacities above 240 F g(-1) when measured in a symmetrical two-electrode configuration. Remarkable capacities of 175 F g(-1) can be retained even at high current densities of 20 A g(-1) as a result of the enhanced ion-transport pathways provided by the cellular mesostructure. Moreover, DUT-70 can be infiltrated with sulfur and host the active material in lithium-sulfur battery cathodes. Reversible capacities of 790 mAh g(-1) are achieved at a current rate of C/10 after 100 cycles, which renders DUT-70 an ideal support material for electrochemical energy-storage applications.

In this regard, their controllable synthesis in a large scale at low cost has readily become a focus of research. Herein we report diatomite-template generic and scalable production of VS2 and other transition metal sulfides targeting emerging energy conversion and storage applications. The conformal growth of VS2 over diatomite template would endow them with defect-abundant features. Throughout detailed experimental investigation in combination with theoretical simulation, we reveal that the enriched active sites/sulfur vacancies of thus-derived VS2 architectures would pose positive impacts on the catalytic performance such in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. We further show that the favorable electrical conductivity and highly exposed sites of VS2 hold promise for serving as sulfur host in the realm of Li-S batteries. Our work offers new insights into the templated and customized synthesis of defect-rich sulfides in a scalable fashion to benefit multifunctional energy applications.

Herein, we propose a "boxes in fibers" strategy and build a hierarchical three-dimensional conductive network, which is based on necklace-like N-doped carbon nanofibers with threaded hollow carbon nanoboxes and TiC nanoparticles (CNB-TiC@CNF),viaa facile electrospinning process. Ideally, a large amount of sulfur could be loaded in the hollow cavities of CNBs and the pores of CNFs, with physically/chemically active sites, while the interconnected conductive network is beneficial for fast Li(+)diffusion and electron transfer. Depending on the hierarchical and porous framework, the volume variation of the lithium polysulfides can be further alleviated. The as-constructed CNB-TiC@CNF with enhanced adsorption and conversion ability to polysulfides achieves a high discharge capacity of 1611 mA h g(-1)at 0.1C, high-rate performance up to 10C for 400 cycles with a decay rate of 0.15% and high sulfur areal loading performance with a stable areal capacity of 7.90 mA h cm(-2)at 9.2 mg cm(-2). Our work provides a novel and efficient strategy for the construction of a three-dimensional hierarchical host as a high-performance cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, little is known about MOFs synthesized using main group metals. Herein, we derived a three-dimensional (3D) pomegranate-like structure of porous carbon microspheres (PCMSs) formed by self-assembly of hollow highly-graphitized thin-walled nanoballs by directly carbonizing indium-MOFs (CPM-5). The formation of this unique 3D porous hierarchical structure is closely related to the presence of indium with a low melting point and its effect of catalyzing carbon graphitization, which is demonstrated to be a robust sulfur host for high performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The S/PCMSs electrodes with the areal sulfur loadings of 2.0 and 4.3 mg cm(-2) deliver the capacities of 1239 mAh g(-1) (742 mAh g(-1)) at 0.2 C (4 C), and 941 mAh g(-1) (480 mAh g(-1)) at 0.2 C (4 C), respectively, with the low capacity decay rates of 0.014%/cycle over 500 cycles at 4 C, and 0.060%/cycle over 900 cycles at 2C, respectively. The superior performance is attributed to the effective physical confinement of polysulfides as a result of highly dispersed sulfur nanoclusters separated by thin carbon walls, the superior conduction arising from the porous highly graphitized conductive networks and the stable 3D structure due to the compact self-assembly of hollow nanoballs compared to dispersed hollow carbon microspheres or nanoparticles. The unique 3D Pomegranate-like structure as a new morphology and structure enriches the carbon material family which is expected to have other potential applications such as electrode materials for lithium ion batteries, catalysis and chemical adsorption.

The adsorption mechanism is elucidated by UV/Vis spectroscopy and surface analysis through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Li2S6 is converted into thiosulfate and polythionate by a catenation reaction on the interfacial boundary of CoC2O4 contacted with carbon. Following this, the active polythionate and short-chained liquid lithium polysulfides (LiPS) bound to the cobalt surface are further reduced as CoC2O4 reduces the overpotential to facilitate the LiPS redox reaction, leading to high specific capacity, lower self-discharge rate, and stable long-term cycling performance.

However, the low conductivity and shuttle efficiency hinder commercial application. Acetylene black (AB) and multi-wall carbon nanotube (CNT) interlayer coating on polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated sulfur composite cathode (S/AB/CNT@PEG) can improve the electrochemical performance of the composite cathode.

However, the severe polysulfide shuttle effect hinders their commercialization process. Although using polar materials to modify the electrode for the adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) can improve the cycle stability to a certain extent, it also causes the decline of the overall energy density due to the extra mass. Herein, we decorate three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene (3DNG) with ultra-thin V(2)O(5)coatings (ALDVO@3DNG) on interior surfacesviacontrollable atomic layer deposition (ALD). The large number of chemisorption sites can firmly anchor LIPSs and inhibit the shuttle effect, while its ultrathin thickness allows the smooth transfer of electrons and promotes the conversion of polysulfides. As a consequence, by controlling the cycles of the ALD process, the optimized ALDVO@3DNG composite delivers an exceptionally great first-cycle discharge capacity of 1555 mA h g(-1)at 0.2C, despite the poor conductivity of V2O5. And it exhibits a good cycling stability with an average decay rate of 0.052% at 2C. Even with a high sulfur loading up to 11.5 mg cm(-2), the ALDVO@3DNG composite still reaches a great capacity of 1296 mA h g(-1)(corresponding to an areal capacity of 14.9 mA h cm(-2)). This work provides an idea and experimental exploration of applying ALD for the ultrathin modification layer to enhance the electrochemical properties with a low extra weight burden, which may extend to other materials that may be applied in Li-S batteries.

Chemical immobilization of LIPS and encapsulation structure of the sulfur cathode are effective strategies to suppress the shuttle effect. Herein, high entropy metal nitride (HEMN) was prepared by mechanochemical-assisted synthesis as an innovative anchor to restrain LIPS via the chemical bonding interaction between HEMN and LIPS. Furthermore, the composite of HEMN and S was encased by graphene (GR) through electrostatic attraction caused by opposite zeta potential, thus as the effective cathode (HEMN/S@GR) of Li-S batteries. HEMN has plentiful active metal sites which can chemically adsorb LIPS, enhancing the cycle life of Li-S batteries. Graphene can accelerate surface charge transfer of sulfur cathode to reduce the interface resistance because of its high conductivity. The initial specific capacity of HEMN/S@GR cathode is 1193 mAh g(-1) and still maintains 695 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. When increased to 1.0 C, the initial specific capacity is 556 mAh g(-1) and exhibits remarkable stability in long cycles. This study presents the synergetic effect of HEMN and graphene on LIPS in Li-S batteries, which introduces a new application way of high entropy materials in the field of energy storage devices.

Inspired by traditional Chinese steamed buns, herein a unique porous microcellular carbon composed of cross-linked nanopores has been synthesized by an eco-friendly biological fermentation using banana peel as a carbon precursor. The specially hierarchical carbon framework obtained under the aerobic respiration and anaerobic breathing of biological yeast during fermenting, and simultaneously the inherent doping of N (3.28 at. %), produce a promising carbon host material to stabilize the structure of electrodes and restrict the dissolution of polysulfides during charging and discharging. The amount of biological yeast has an important influence on the microstructure of the biomass carbons and the correlated electrochemical properties of carbon/sulfur electrodes. The optimal amount of biological yeast is 3.0 wt %, where the carbon/sulfur composite electrode possesses a sulfur loading of 74.34 wt % and achieves a large initial reversible capacity of 1174 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and a high capacity hold of 58.35% after 100 cycles. Our study provides a novel eco-friendly strategy to fabricate the interconnected hierarchical porous carbon framework from living wastes for various energy storage and conversion applications, including lithium-ion battery, supercapacitor, etc.	[Xia, Li; Zhou, Yibei; Ren, Juan; Wu, Huali; Lin, Dunmin; Xie, Fengyu; Jie, Wenjing; Xu, Chenggang; Zheng, Qiaoji] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Chengdu 610066, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Lam, Kwok Ho] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China		Lin, DM; Zheng, QJ (corresponding author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Chengdu 610066, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	ddmd222@sicnu.edu.cn; joyce@sicnu.edu.cn	Lam, K.H./B-7765-2014; Lin, Dunmin/D-6765-2012	Lam, K.H./0000-0003-1456-9049; Lin, Dunmin/0000-0002-2245-6717	Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2018JY0447]; Sichuan Normal University Excellent Cultivation Foundation [2018030]	Sichuan Science and Technology Program; Sichuan Normal University Excellent Cultivation Foundation	This work was supported by Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2018JY0447) and Sichuan Normal University Excellent Cultivation Foundation (No. 2018030).		51	34	34	4	83	AMER CHEMICAL SOC	WASHINGTON	1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA	0887-0624	1520-5029		ENERG FUEL	Energy Fuels	SEP	2018	32	9					9997	10007		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b01453	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b01453			11	Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Energy & Fuels; Engineering	GU9XX					2022-07-15	WOS:000445711700105

Herein, a novel N,P-codoped trichoderma spore carbon (TSC) with a bowl structure, prepared by a "trichoderma bioreactor" and annealing process is reported. Moreover, TSC shows excellent compatibility with conductive niobium carbide (NbC), which is in situ implanted into the TSC matrix in the form of nanoparticles forming a highly porous TSC/NbC host. Importantly, NbC plays a dual role in TSC for not only pore formation but also enhancement of conductivity. Excitingly, the sulfur can be well accommodated in the TSC/NbC host forming a high-performance TSC/NbC-S cathode, which exhibits greatly enhanced rate performance (810 mAh g(-1) at 5 C) and long cycling life (937.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C after 500 cycles), superior to TSC-S and other carbon/S counterparts due to the larger porosity, higher conductivity, and better synergetic trapping effect for the soluble polysulfide intermediate. The synergetic work of porous the conductive architecture, heterodoped N&P polar sites in TSC and polar conductive NbC provides new opportunities for enhancing physisorption and chemisorption of polysulfides leading to higher capacity and better rate capability.

Characterization of Sulfur and Nanostructured Sulfur Battery Cathodes in Electron Microscopy Without Sublimation Artifacts	MICROSCOPY AND MICROANALYSIS			English	Article						Cryo-TEM; airSEM; lithium sulfur; battery; energy	CARBON NANOTUBES; CYCLE LIFE; LITHIUM; SURFACE; VACUUM; TEM	Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries have the potential to provide higher energy storage density at lower cost than conventional lithium ion batteries. A key challenge for Li-S batteries is the loss of sulfur to the electrolyte during cycling. This loss can be mitigated by sequestering the sulfur in nanostructured carbon-sulfur composites. The nanoscale characterization of the sulfur distribution within these complex nanostructured electrodes is normally performed by electron microscopy, but sulfur sublimates and redistributes in the high-vacuum conditions of conventional electron microscopes. The resulting sublimation artifacts render characterization of sulfur in conventional electron microscopes problematic and unreliable. Here, we demonstrate two techniques, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and scanning electron microscopy in air (airSEM), that enable the reliable characterization of sulfur across multiple length scales by suppressing sulfur sublimation. We use cryo-TEM and airSEM to examine carbon-sulfur composites synthesized for use as Li-S battery cathodes, noting several cases where the commonly employed sulfur melt infusion method is highly inefficient at infiltrating sulfur into porous carbon hosts.

The effective solution is to replace the liquid electrolyte with a solid one with high ionic conductivity and excellent electrochemical stability. Herein we report a lithium superionic conductor of Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 as a solid electrolyte via high-energy milling. The Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 glass-ceramic possessed a high ionic conductivity of 5.6 mS cm(-1) at room temperature and a wide voltage stability up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+. Sulfur-based composites were prepared by mixing sulfur powder, carbon black and the solid electrolyte and utilized as the cathode for all-solid-state LSBs. Noticeably, the sulfur composite cathode showed a large capacity of 796 mA h g(-1) at 0.05C and much better cycling stability than the counterpart with organic liquid electrolyte. Our newly designed solid electrolyte shows promising industrial prospects for application in all-solid-state LSBs.

Here, Mo2C nanorods that were surface-decorated with metallic-organic framework-derived nitrogen-doped carbon and ultrasmall cobalt nanoparticles (NC-Co@Mo2C) were used as the materials for lithium-sulfur battery cathodes. The prepared NC-Co@Mo2C@S composites had the specific capacity of 1073 mAh.g(-1) (0.2 C) and the retained 806 mAh.g(-1) after 200 cycles, thus showing excellent discharge specific capacity and cycling stability. The Mo2C nanorods can adsorb lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through the formation of MoAS bonds. Cobalt nanoparticles electrocatalytically accelerated the redox kinetic conversion of LiPSs. Nitrogen doping can effectively reduce the energy potential barrier. The interconnected multidimensional backbone of NC-Co@(MoC)-C-2 composites contributed to electrolyte permeation, fast electron/Li+ transport, and sufficient volume change buffering. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the adsorption ability of Mo2C nanorods and the catalytic ability of cobalt nanoparticles can effectively improve the sulfur fixation ability of the composites and greatly suppress the shuttle effect.

The cathode is based on monodisperse highly porous carbon nanospheres derived from a facile template-and surfactant-free method. At the mesoscale, the nanospheres structure into interconnected close-packed clusters of a few microns in extent, thus facilitating the fabrication of dense crack-free high areal sulfur loading (5 mg cm(-2)) cathodes with high electrical conductivity and low cathode impedance. A combination of the nitrogen doping (5 wt%), high porosity (2.3 cm(3) g(-1)), and surface area (2900 m(2) g(-1)) at the microscale enables high sulfur immobilization and utilization. The cathode delivers among the best reported volumetric capacity to date, above typical Li-ion areal capacity at 0.2 C over 200 cycles and low capacity fading of 0.1% per cycle at 0.5 C over 500 cycles. The compact cathode structure also ensures a low electrolyte requirement (6 mu L mg(-1)), which aids a low overall cell weight, and further, among the best gravimetric capacities published to date as well.

Here we report design of efficient polysulfide trap by preparing graphene like nitrogen doped carbon (NBC) sheets from bagasse (sugarcane waste). Further, we prepared S@NBC composites by chemical absorption of S onto NBC matrix and studied their beneficial aspects as cathode for Li-S battery. The S@NBC displays extraordinarily good performance with a reversible capacity of 1169 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with 77% capacity retention after 200 cycles which also exhibits remarkable 85% retention of higher order polysulfide even after 200 cycles. Moreover, by placing a second cathode layer the cyclability will be increased beyond 500 cycles. The remarkable cycling performance is attributed to the effective chemisorption of sulfur and polysulfides by the nitrogen doped carbon. Further, sulfur loading is increased to 12 mg cm(-2) by stacking four cathode layers and we could achieve high areal capacity of 12 mAh cm(-2) which is three times higher than the present day lithium ion battery.

The perfect 3D interconnected nanostructure as a sulfur host displayed excellent electrochemical performance compared to the MnO(2)tubes. Benefiting from the well-interconnected 3D spherical architecture, the MnO2/S cathode can reach a high specific capacity of 1582.9 mA h g(-1)at 0.1C and a preferable cycling stability with excellent Coulombic efficiency. The porous 3D architecture and the interaction of the Mn-S chemical bond can not only facilitate electron transport, lithium diffusion, and relieve the volume expansion of S but can also effectively restrict the shuttling effect of soluble polysulfides generated during the charge-discharge process.

But achieving long term cyclability with moderate capacity loss, and scalability pose formidable challenges. A solution phase approach for the preparation of a composite of sulfur with hydroxyl groups functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTols) and coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole) (PEDOP) is presented for the first time. Comparison of the Li S performances at 0.1 C current-rate show that the S based cell with a S-loading of 80% retains a low capacity of 122 mAh g(suifur)(-1) after 100 cycles, whereas cells with S/MWCNTols and S/MWCNTols/PEDOP composites with sulfur loadings of 73 and 70% respectively, retain capacities of 384 and 624 mAh g(suifur)(-1) after 200 charge-discharge cycles, with Coulombic efficiencies of 96 and 98.7% respectively. This performance differential illustrates the role of PEDOP in inhibiting sulfur loss and in maximizing cell response. The polymer provides electrical interconnects between the insulating sulfur clusters and facilitates Li+ transfer at the interface. The ease of the synthesis, coupled with the remarkable cycling performance delivered by this composite at a high sulfur-loading, demonstrate the promise that this S/CNT/conducting polymer composite has for practical Li-S batteries.

The uniform micro/mesoporous structure is ascribed to metal sublimation in the Zn-based MOF during the pyrolysis process. The cathode exhibits an excellent cycling performance due to the homogeneous distribution of micro/mesopores and the 2D nanosheet structure, which does not only lead to the loading of evenly distributed, ultrafine sulfur, but also favors the depressing shuttle effect and a rapid electron transfer. Meanwhile, reduced oxide graphene (rGO) - as the conductive agent - is beneficial for the continuity of the electron-transport path and for increasing the utilization of active materials. The optimized MMPC cathode exhibits a superior cycling stability at a rate of 1 C, with 1500 cycles, and an outstanding rate-cycle performance with an initial discharge capacity of 670.1 mAh g(-1) and a good cycling stability after 400 cycles at a rate of 5 C.

Although many strategies have been proposed to restrain the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through physical trapping and chemical binding, the sluggish kinetics of PS conversion still degrade the capacity, rate, and cycling performance of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel kind of few-layer BN with engineered nitrogen vacancies (v-BN) has been developed as a cathode matrix for Li-S batteries. The positive vacancies in the BN nanosheets not only promote the immobilization and conversion of LiPSs, but also accelerate the lithium ion diffusion in cathode electrodes. Compared with pristine BN, the v-BN cathodes exhibit higher initial capacities from 775 mA h g(-1) to 1262 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and a high average coulombic efficiency of over 98 % during 150 cycles. Upon increasing the current density to 1 C, the cell still preserves a capacity of 406 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles, exhibiting a capacity decay of only 0.084 % per cycle. The new vacancy-engineered material provides a promising method for achieving excellent performance in Li-S batteries.

The carbon onion mixing was assisted by shear in a two-roll mill to capitalize on the softened state of the copolymer. The sulfur copolymer and the hybrids were thoroughly characterized in structure and chemical composition, and finally tested by electrochemical benchmarking. An enhancement of specific capacity was observed over 140 cycles at higher content of carbon onions in the hybrid electrodes. The copolymer hybrids demonstrate a maximum initial specific capacity of 1150 mA h g(sulfur)(-1) (850 mA h g(electrode)(-1)) and a low decay of capacity to reach 790 mA h g(sulfur)(-1) (585 mA h g(electrode)(-1)) after 140 charge/discharge cycles. All carbon onion/sulfur copolymer hybrid electrodes yielded high chemical stability, stable electrochemical performance superior to conventional melt-infiltrated reference samples having similar sulfur and carbon onion content. The amount of carbon onions embedded in the sulfur copolymer has a strong influence on the specific capacity, as they effectively stabilize the sulfur copolymer and sterically hinder the recombination of sulfur species to the S-8 configuration.

Here, 3D SCNT@MXene cages are synthesized by a simple approach that solve these problems. The 3D cages with interconnected conductive networks can improve sulfur utilization, decrease inherent resistance and enhance reaction kinetics. The ultrathin MXene shell with high surface area and plenty of terminal functional groups can prevent the aggregation of MXene, increase chemical interactions and catalytic effect with sulfur species to promote the adsorption of lithium polysulfides and the nucleation of Li2S. Moreover, the porous S-CNT sphere with sulfur nanoparticles on the surface of CNTs can facilitate electron transport, electrolyte infiltration and accommodation sulfur swelling. As a result, the 3D S-CNT@MXene cage cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 1375.1 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, high rate capacity (910.3 and 557.3 mAh g-1 at 1.0 and 8.0 C), and excellent cycling stability. Remarkably, the composite cathode shows almost no capacity decay (656.3 mAh g-1) at a high current density of 4.0C after 150cycles, which shows the best cycling stability reported to date among all other cathodes of Li-S batteries.

Here, a flexible and conductive TiN-Ti4O7 core-shell nanofiber (TiNOC) membrane reactor is designed to electrocatalytically mediate Li/S conversion chemistry. The Ti, N, and O atoms in the nanofiber function as electrocatalysts and chemical confinement active sites to initiate long-chain LiPS conversion and phase change, as well as to suppress soluble LiPS shuttling. With a sulfur cathode-membrane reactor module configuration, Li/S cells possess a high sulfur utilization of 91.20%, good rate capability of 869.10 mA h g(-1), and high capacity retention of 92.49%, with a coulomb efficiency of 99.57% after 200 cycles at 5 C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the optimized chemisorption configurations facilitate the elongation of Li-S and S-S bonds, as well as charge transfer along Ti-S and Li-N bonds, which favors bond breakage, bond formation, and the activation of solid-state S-8, Li2S2, and Li2S. Layer-by-layer module stacking provides Li/S batteries with a high areal sulfur loading of 12.00 mg cm(-2) to deliver a high areal capacity of 14.40 mA h cm(-2) at 2.26 mA. Two batteries in series can power real-world applications such as light emitting diode (LED) bulbs with a high energy output of 69.00 mW h.

Through simply posttreating the ordinary sulfur cathode in atmospheric environment just for several minutes, the Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) were well-decorated on/in the surface and pores of the electrode composed of commercial acetylene black (CB) and sulfur powder. The Au NPs can covalently stabilize the sulfur/LiPSs, which is advantageous for restricting the shuttle effect. Moreover, the LiPSs reservoirs of Au NPs with high conductivity can significantly control the deposition of the trapped LiPSs, contributing to the uniform distribution of sulfur species upon charging/discharging. The slight modification of the cathode with <3 wt % Au NPs has favorably prospered the cycle capacity and stability of Li-S batteries. Moreover, this cathode exhibited an excellent anti-self-discharge ability. The slight decoration for the ordinary electrode, which can be easily accessed in the industrial process, provides a facile strategy for improving the performance of commercial carbon-based Li-S batteries toward practical application.

In this work, graphitic N-doped multi-wall carbon nanotube (GN/PNCNTs) composites are synthesized by in situ chemical polymerization and carbonization processes. The nitrogen doping in the GN/PNCNTs composite can effectively enhance chemisorption between sulfur and carbon, which can enable the uniform deposition of discharge products and lead to a high utilization and reversibility of active materials. Because of these technological superiorities, the as-prepared S-GN/PNCNTs cathode with a sulfur content of 60 wt% exhibits high initial specific capacity and excellent cycling stability at up to 600 cycles at 1C. Meanwhile, the rate capacities of the cathode are demonstrated from 0.5C to 6C with a specific capacity of 1178 mA h g(-1) (the initial specific capacity) to 586 mA h g(-1) (the 60th cycle).

However, the dissolution of polysulfides and the "shuttle effect" lead to serious capacity degradation, which greatly hinders the industrial application of Li-S batteries. Herein, we propose a bifunctional quinone-type salt to anchor polysulfides and suppress their dissolution for use in high-performance Li-S batteries. We find that the tetrahydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone disodium salt dimer (TBS-dimer) does not dissolve in organic electrolytes and can be generated at 400 degrees C. The abundant reactive keto groups and double bonds result in the TBS-dimers having numerous "hot spots" for capturing sulfur (TBS/S-400) in the three-dimensional space of the molecule. The insolubility and abundant active sites of the organic salt remarkably suppress the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. As a result, the TBS/S-400 composite delivers a capacity decay rate of only 0.023% per cycle over 600 cycles at 2 C. The use of organic salts to effectively suppress the dissolution of lithium polysulfides opens a new avenue for the practical applications of high-performance Li-S batteries.

J	Jeon, T; Jung, SC				Jeon, Taegon; Jung, Sung Chul			The molecular sieving mechanism of a polysulfide-blocking metal-organic framework separator for lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							CYCLE PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE OXIDE; INTERLAYER; FILM; SOLVENT; STABILITY; PROGRESS; HKUST-1; INSIGHT	Development of functional separators that block the migration of lithium polysulfides (LPSs) is an efficient way to suppress the shuttle effect, a critical issue restricting the practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. A metal-organic framework (MOF) has been used as a separator for sieving out the LPSs while allowing the Li+ ions to pass through. This study is the first to elucidate the sieving process of the MOF at the atomic level by examining the penetration of Li+ ions and LPSs solvated by 1,2-dimethylethane (DME) molecules into the Cu-3(BTC)(2) (BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate) MOF nanosheet. The solvated LPSs, i.e., Li2Sx(DME)(4) (x = 8, 6, and 4), are too large to enter the pores of the MOF. The partially desolvated LPSs, i.e., Li2Sx(DME)(2), can enter the pores but get trapped in the pore walls due to the high penetration barriers of 1.73-1.99 eV. However, the partially desolvated Li+ ions, i.e., Li+(DME)(2), can pass through the MOF layer by overcoming a much lower penetration barrier of 0.66 eV without getting trapped in the pore walls. Moreover, Li+(DME)(2) can move rapidly within the MOF layer with a very low diffusion barrier of 0.32 eV. The LPS-blocking ability of the MOF results from (1) the steric repulsion between the LPSs and the pore wall due to the pore size not being larger than the size of the LPSs and (2) the formation of chemical bonds between the LPSs and the pore wall due to the solvation structure of the LPSs incompletely surrounded by solvents. The sieving mechanism of the MOF presented in this study will be helpful not only for designing efficient microporous separators for Li-S batteries but also for understanding the transport across general microporous materials.

Herein, a new strategy is proposed based on the electrostatic attraction and catalytic effect of polysulfides for the modification of the polypropylene (PP) separator. Guanidinium-based ionic-covalent organic nanosheets (iCON) on the surface of Ti3C2 is presented as a coating layer for the PP separator. The synergetic effects of Ti3C2 and iCON provide new platforms to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides, expedite the redox kinetics of sulfur species, and promote efficient conversion of the intercepted polysulfides. The functional separator endows carbon nanotube/sulfur cathodes with excellent electrochemical performance. The average capacity decay per cycle within 2000 cycles at 2 C is as low as 0.006%. The separator is even effective in the case of sulfur content of 90 wt% and sulfur loading of 7.6 mg cm(-2); the reversible capacity, areal capacity, and volumetric capacity at 0.1 C are as high as 1186 mA h g(-1), 9.01 mA h cm(-2), and 1201 mA h cm(-3), respectively. This work provides a promising approach toward separator modification for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

Suffering from the sluggish redox kinetics together with the accumulated intermediate Li2Sx (x = 4-8) polysulfides in the liquid electrolytes during charging/discharging, the high-performance Li-S batteries are stagnant by the issues such as high level of electrochemical irreversibility and poor cyclability. Herein, a bifunctional interlayer composed of metallic conductive NiCo2S4 nanosheets with large area and mesopores supported on carbon textile (NiCo2S4@CT) is fabricated for high-performance Li-S batteries. The mesoporous and metallic conductive NiCo2S4 nanosheets with large area not only provide strong chemical bonding for polysulfides, but also show efficient catalytic effect towards accelerating the polysulfide redox reactions. When served as an interlayer, NiCo2S4@CT endows the Li-S batteries with a high initial capacity of approximate to 1600 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and ultra-stable cycling performance with a slow capacity decay rate of 0.018% per cycle over 500 cycles. The results proffer a facile and promising approach to design Li-S batteries with high rate performance and high reversible capacities.

High sulfur loaded carbon aerogel cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES; POLYMER ELECTROLYTES; CYCLING STABILITY; GRAPHENE; COMPOSITE; CELLS; FORMALDEHYDE; PERFORMANCE; RESORCINOL	An attempt made to improve sulfur loading in a template-free porous carbon to the extent of 70 wt% has led to two interesting observations being inferred, viz., 60 wt% sulfur loading exhibits superior electrochemical properties in the S@C composite form and an enhanced 73 wt% sulfur loading leads to the formation-cum-stabilisation of sulfur in its monoclinic phase. Carbon aerogel with tunable properties, derived from the catalyst-aided cross linking of resorcinol and formaldehyde, possessing a specific surface area of 1395 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 1.423 cm(3) g(-1) has been exploited for sulfur loading to form a series of S@C composites. Interestingly, carbon aerogel prepared in the present study offers multifarious advantages such as conducting additive, potential host to accommodate higher concentrations of sulfur and better polysulfide confining matrix. The 60 wt% sulfur loaded carbon aerogel composite exhibits an appreciable specific capacity of 600 mA h g(-1) at a C/10 rate up to 100 cycles, 480 mA h g(-1) at a 1C and 422 mA h g(-1) at a 2C rate. Hence, the capability of carbon aerogel, synthesized through the present study in accommodating higher concentrations of sulfur, effective management of polysulfide shuttle, and provision of favorable electrode-electrolyte interface to facilitate extended cycling possibilities at different current densities has been demonstrated.

Functional materials with a strong affinity and catalytic effect toward polysulfides play a key role in addressing these issues. Herein, we report a defect-rich amorphous a-Fe3O4-x/GO material with a nanocube-interlocked structure as an adsorber as well as an electrocatalyst for the Li-S battery. The composition and defect structure of the material are determined by X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The distinctive open framework architecture of the as-engineered composite inherited from the metal-organic framework precursor ensures the stability and activity of the catalyst during extended cycles. The oxygen defects in the amorphous structure are capable of absorbing polysulfides and similarly work as catalytic centers to boost polysulfide conversion. Taking advantage of a-Fe3O4-x/GO on the separator surface, the Li-S battery shows a capacity over 610 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and a low decay rate of 0.12% per cycle over 500 cycles and superior rate capability. The functional material made via the low-cost synthesis process provides a potential solution for advanced Li-S batteries.

Different ratios of the PANi@S-C composite are characterized by SEM, TEM, FTIR, XRD and electrochemical methods. The conductive polyaniline plays multiple roles in the composite, acting as a conducting additive and a porous adsorbing agent. It is uniformly coated onto the surface of a S-C composite powder to form a core/shell structure, which significantly enhances the electrochemical performance and cycle life of the sulfur cells. The PANi@S-C composite with 12.5 wt% PANi presents optimum electrochemical performance, where the initial discharge specific capacity is 1257 mAhg(-1) and remains similar to 600 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.16 mAcm(-2). After a rate test from 0.1 to 1 mAcm(-2), the cell remained at similar to 600 mAhg(-1) sulfur after 50 cycles when the current density returned to 0.1 mAcm(-2). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is based on a semi-liquid cathode composed of a Li2S8 polysulphide catholyte and a binder-free carbon nanofiber membrane with tailored morphology. The polysulphides in the catholyte have the dual role of active material and providing Li+-conduction, i.e. no traditional Li-salt is used in this cell. The cell is able to deliver an areal capacity as high as 7 mAh cm(-2), twice than that of commercial Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) and 2-4 times higher than that of state-of-the-art LiS cells. In addition, the battery concept has an improved sustainability from a material point of view by being mainly based on sulfur and carbon and being completely fluorine-free, no fluorinated salt or binders are used, and has potential for upscaling and competitive price. The combination of these properties makes the semi-liquid LiS cell here reported a very promising new concept for practical large-scale energy storage applications.

In this work, we describe a hierarchically porous N-doped zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)-derived carbon nanosphere (N-ZDC) with an outer shell and an inner honeycomb-like interconnected nanosheet network as sulfur host material for high-performance and long-term lithium-sulfur batteries. The N-ZDC serves as multilayered barrier against the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. The porously inner interconnected carbon network of the N-ZDC facilitates the electron and ion transportation, ensures a high sulfur loading, and accommodates a volume expansion of the sulfur species. As a result, the optimized N-ZDC(4)/S electrodes displayed high initial specific capacities of 1343, 1182, and 698 mAhg(-1) at 0.5, 1, and 2 C, respectively, and an ultraslow capacity decay of only 0.048% per cycle at 2 C over 800 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading of 3.1 mgcm(-2), N-ZDC(4)/S still delivered a reversible capacity of 956 mAhg(-1) and stabilizes at 544 mAhg(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 C, revealing the great potential of the novel carbon nanospheres for energy storage application.

However, their commercial viability is challenged by uncontrollable dendritic Li growth and severe polysulfide shuttling during cycling. Here, a 3D framework coupling lithiophilic and catalytic CoSe nanoparticles with conductive carbon nanowires (CoSe@C) as an efficient host both for lithium and sulfur is reported. As a cathode host, CoSe@C offers highly efficient catalytic activity for polysulfide redox. As a rationally designed matrix with a high affinity for Li, CoSe@C guides a homogenous growth of Li within the 3D framework, which effectively suppresses dendritic Li growth. As a result, the CoSe@C/Li anode exhibits an ultralong lifespan of > 3000 h with a low overpotential of <23 mV. Remarkably, a full cell with a S/CoSe@C cathode and a CoSe@C/Li anode with a low negative to positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio of approximate to 4 exhibits long cycle life of over 600 cycles with a high areal capacity of 5.8 mA h cm(-2). It also remains stable after 50 cycles even with lean electrolyte (E/S: 4.5 mu L mg(-1)) and a low N/P ratio of approximate to 4. This work offers new insights and opportunities for developing dendrite-free, high-performance Li-S battery technology.

Herein, laser-induced micro-explosive techniques were firstly demonstrated as high-efficient polysulfide mediator for Li-S batteries, in which unique hierarchical structure (nitrogen-doped porous carbon (LNPCs) skeletons uniformly decorated with metal oxide nanoparticles) were designed and constructed. The as-assembled nitrogen-doped porous carbons decorated with ZnO nanoparticles (LNPCs-ZnO) hybrids cathode perform exceptionally high discharge capacity of 1184.9 mAh g-1 at 0.5C and excellent rate discharge capacity of 716.1 mA h g-1 at 3C, as well as a remarkable cycling performance (a lowcapacity decay rate of 0.31% per cycle at 0.5C upon 1000 cycles). Moreover, impressive areal sulfur loading up to 6.7 mg cm-2 leads to a high initial areal capacity of 6.36 mAh cm-2 and excellent cycling stability at 0.2C. The DFT calculations propose that the intrinsic interaction and the rapid catalytical effects play the key role in suppressing the shuttling effect of LiPSs. This work provides new insights for novel structure design and opens up a potential route to construct Li-S batteries with high areal sulfur loadings for their practical applications.

Bio-carbon contains micro-pores and bestowed with high specific surface area of 2029 m(2)/g and pore volume of 1.2 ccm/g. Specifically, 60 wt.% S@bio-carbon cathode with biocarbon interlayer exhibits 642 mAh/g at C/2 rate up to 75 cycles, which is two times higher than the capacity obtained without bio-carbon interlayer. Notably, bio-carbon interlayer leads to a 2-3 fold decrease in shuttle current and improves the performance of Li-S cell. Besides, effect of combination of bio-carbon and Super-P carbon as scaffold and/or as interlayer is studied, wherein bio-carbon as scaffold and as interlayer outperforms in terms of capacity retention, better Coulombic efficiency and higher active material holding capability in Li-S batteries. Furthermore, even at a high rate of 3C, bio-carbon/S-60 cathode with bio-carbon interlayer exhibits a capacity of 256 mAh/g, mainly due to the facile lithium kinetics of sulfur in the jamun seed derived bio-carbon interlayer containing Li-S batteries.

However, commercialization of Li-S batteries has been impeded because of low loading amount of active materials and poor cycle performance. Herein, a freestanding bilayer carbon-sulfur (FBCS) cathode is reported with superior electrochemical performance at a high sulfur loading level (3 mg cm(-2)). The top component of the FBCS cathode is composed of interlacing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and the bottom component is made up of a mixed layer of sulfur imbedded in MWCNT and N-doped porous carbon (NPC). The MWCNT layer (top part of FBCS cathode) blocks polysulfide migration from the cathode to the anode, and NPC in the bottom part of the FBCS cathode not only provides spacious active sites but also absorbs polysulfide by the nitrogen functional group. The designed novel FBCS cathode delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 964 and 900 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 and 1 C, respectively. It also displayed an excellent capacity retention of 83.1% at 0.5 C and 83.4% at 1 C after 300 cycles.

However, the poor electrical conductivity and structural stability of elemental sulfur and the dissolution of the polysulfides have confined the utilization of elemental sulfur and the cyclic retention of capacity.

However, suitable inks and 3D print favorable architectures with high electrochemical performances for energy storage are still being explored. Here, sulfur copolymer-graphene architectures with well-designed periodic microlattices are 3D printed as a cathode for Li-S batteries using a suitable ink composed of sulfur particles, 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene (DIB), and condensed graphene oxide dispersion. Using thermal treatment, elemental sulfur can be reacted with DIB to produce sulfur copolymer, which can partially suppress the dissolution of polysulfides. Moreover, graphene in the architecture can provide high electrical conductivity for whole electrode. Hence, 3D printed sulfur copolymer-graphene architecture exhibits a high reversible capacity of 812.8 mA h g(-1) and good cycle performance. Such a simple 3D printing approach can be further extended to construct many complex architectures for various energy storage devices.

Consequently, this cell system has become an active subject of academic and industrial research. Therefore, new records for gravimetric, as well as volumetric energy densities have been reported in recent years. To further increase the volumetric energy density of the cells, the electrodes are often densified. Hence, the influence of the cathode density on the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries is still not fully understood. Herein, dry-processed (DRYtraec) sulfur carbon cathodes with varying electrode densities are tested with ether-based electrolytes under lean electrolyte (5 mu L mg(s)(-1)) conditions. The electrochemical evaluation reveals that the density does not influence the performance of the cathodes at coin-cell level as their density is altered upon electrolyte contact due to swelling. To monitor this, dynamic swelling experiments via confocal microscopy are conducted. Subsequently, the findings are transferred to investigate the influence of cathode swelling on the volumetric energy density. The influence of cathode swelling on the volumetric energy density of pouch cells is calculated based on the cathodes investigated at coin-cell level.

Despite progress, the energy density of current Li-S technologies is still below that of conventional intercalation-type cathode materials due to limited stability and utilization efficiency at high sulfur loading. Here, we present a conducting polymer hydrogel integrated highly performing free-standing three-dimensional (3D) monolithic electrode architecture for Li-S batteries with superior electrochemical stability and energy density. The electrode layout consists of a highly conductive three-dimensional network of N,P codoped carbon with well-dispersed metal-organic framework nanodomains of ZIF-67 and HKUST-1. The hierarchical monolithic 3D carbon networks provide an excellent environment for charge and electrolyte transport as well as mechanical and chemical stability. The electrically integrated MOF nanodomains significantly enhance the sulfur loading and retention capabilities by inhibiting the release of lithium polysulfide specificities as well as improving the charge transfer efficiency at the electrolyte interface. Our optimal 3D carbon-HKUST-1 electrode architecture achieves a very high areal capacity of >16 mAh cm-2 and volumetric capacity (CV) of 1230.8 mAh cm(-3) with capacity retention of 82% at 0.2C for over 300 cycles, providing an attractive candidate material for future high-energy density Li-S batteries.

The influence of N and B co-doping on the morphology, structure, composition and related electrochemical performance of the NBCGNs was systematically investigated, and the results show that urea and boric acid coexisting in the hydrothermal system not only act as the N and B doping sources but also act as the catalysts to boost the synergistical doping of N and B. It is the synergistical effect of N and B co-doping that endows the NBCGNs with enlarged specific surface area as well as pore volume, improved conductivity, promoted sulfur dispersibility and strengthened adsorbability for polysulfides caused by the notably increased doped N and B contents and higher percentage of the N-B structure when compared with the counterparts. As a result, the as-prepared NBCGN/S cathode presented synergistically enhanced cyclability and rate capability. Therefore, our results not only provide a superior carbon host for Li-S batteries but also offer a common approach to the preparation of heteroatom doped carbon nanomaterials with an optimized structure and composition.

Compared with x = 0, the ionic conductivity for the sample with x = 0.1334 improved by similar to 3 orders of magnitude. The lithium movement activation energy and pre-exponential factor A were found to be dependent on the x value.

Additionally, the all-solid-state Li-S battery cell performance also displayed an enhancement in both the initial capacity and stability for sample x = 0.1667 compared with x = 0.

'Be water' strategy of liquid lithium sulfide enables 0.2 V potential barrier for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Cosolvent strategy; p-orbital of boron; Vanadium diboride; Electrical conductivity; Interface catalysis	TIO2 NANOWIRE ARRAYS; EFFICIENT ELECTROCATALYST; POLYSULFIDE REDOX; SHUTTLE; BOROPHENE; CATHODE; CONVERSION; COMPOSITE; SUBUNITS; GRAPHENE	The Li2S-based lithium-sulfur battery is an attractive option for next-generation energy storage, which can couple with Li-free anodes to reveal a feasible approach to circumvent the safety issue of the highly reactive lithium metal. However, bulk Li2S needs a high activation potential with the electrolyte decomposition in the initial oxidation and shows uncontrollable polysulfides migration in the cycling. To address these challenges, a facile solvation strategy to fully dissolve bulk Li2S is developed to achieve the only 0.2 V potential barrier without any hyperthermal treatments and/or additives. Meanwhile, the novel VB2 materials offer abundant active sites to confine polysulfide migration with the low self-lithiation property. With those ingenious tailoring of cell designs, the VB2-based liquid Li2S cell achieves a stable capacity (530 mAh/g with 2 mg/cm(2)) at 1.0 C with an extremely low fading capacity (78% capacity retention) after 500 cycles. More importantly, this strategy provides a novel insight into the liquid Li2S-based lithium-sulfur battery with a better performance for the commercial applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their practical implementation is still subjected to the insulation of sulfur and discharge products, serious shuttle effect, and large volume expansion of sulfur during the discharge/charge processes. Herein, polyimide nanoarrays functionalized carbon nanotubes (PI@CNT) were proposed as a sulfur host with the incorporation of additional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) conductive networks. The as-preformed polyimide nanoarrays on the surface of CNTs expose sufficient adsorption sites for sulfur loading. PI@CNT chemically bind lithium polysulfides (LiPS) via the polar Li-N bonding interaction and physically confine LiPS in the network. Meanwhile, the intertwined frameworks can bear the volume expansion of sulfur and maintain the electrode integrity. The PI@CNT/CNT/S cathode exhibits the sulfur loading as high as 70 wt% and shows the cycling stability with a capacity retention of 67% after 300 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, the additional incorporation of CNTs can form continuous electron transfer paths, thereby promoting the rate capability. This work integrated the polar polymer host and conductive networks with robust LiPS trapping and fast conversion, and would propose a new paradigm for designing high-performance sulfur cathodes.

There are obvious limitations of using single polar or nonpolar binding, and it is needed to effectively combine the polar materials to the nonpolar matrix/sulfur. Here, we mechanically mixed 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (Emim-dca)-based pore-making polar carbon (P-ILC) with nonpolar cotton carbon activated by KOH/sulfur (C-KOH/S) to study the influence of the polar mixture on specific capacity and cycle stability of the battery. Comparing with the nonpolar cathode, the nonpolar-polar cathode has better electrochemical performance. The C-KOH/S cathode with polar mixture of P-ILC shows a higher specific capacity (500 mAh g(-1) at 100th 1C) and cyclic stability (average attenuation 0.34%). It is because the P-ILC+C-KOH/S effectively combines the nonpolar physical binding and polar chemical anchoring by using the method of zonal binding of active materials.

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) multi-cavity carbon nanofiber film decorated with Co-N-x doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNTs@CNF) has been designed and endowed with dual functions as the sulfur host and an interlayer simultaneously. The multi-cavity structure of Co-NCNTs@CNF provides enough space for high-loading sulfur and relieves the volume expansion of sulfur. In situ protruded CNTs and CNF form a conductive framework conducive to accelerating the electrons/ions transfer. The macroporous structure caused by the introduction of Co-containing hydrotalcite is beneficial for electrolyte penetration, thereby reducing the E/S. Co-N-x sites can act as high-efficiency adsorbents and catalysts to adsorb polysulfides and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides rapidly. Owing to the synergistic effect, the Co-NCNTs@CNF-0.42-S cathode with an interlayer delivers a high areal capacity of 4.77 mA h cm(-2) at 0.2C after 100 cycles under the sulfur loading of 6.7 mg cm(-2) and E/S = 10 mu L mg(-1). This strategy provides a new insight for preparing sulfur cathode materials that can work at low E/S under high sulfur loading.

Sulfur was sublimed and entered the EG pores when the mixtures were heated and was condensed to form particles within the pores during cooling. The pores of the EG acted as microcontainers to host the sulfur, and the material, with its interconnected and conductive pore walls, acted as a current collector for the cathode of the Li-S battery. The size of sulfur particles in the EG pores could be controlled by the S/EG mass ratio. When the ratio is 10:1, relatively uniform size sulfur particles could be obtained. Both the S/EG ratio and the sulfur particle size have an important effect on the capacity increase of the Li-S battery. Using a composite with a S/EG ratio of 10 :1 as the cathode gives the highest capacity of 1 020 mAhg(-1) at a rate of 0. 1 C.

Effects of Liquid Electrolytes on the Charge-Discharge Performance of Rechargeable Lithium/Sulfur Batteries: Electrochemical and in-Situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopic Studies	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							COMPOSITE CATHODE MATERIALS; SULFUR CATHODE; CELL; CARBONATE	A sulfur/carbon composite has been prepared to serve as a cathode for lithium/sulfur batteries. The effects of seven different liquid electrolytes on the electrochemical performance were investigated using galvanostatic discharge-charge tests on coin cells. The electrolytes included ether, sulfone, and carbonate solvents with common lithium salts. It was found that the solvent plays a key role on the electrochemical performance of the lithium/sulfur battery cathode while the lithium salt has no significant effects. Additional characterization, using in situ sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), provided insights into the soluble sulfur species in the discharged and charged batteries. We find that the use of low-viscosity ethereal solvents results in a more complete reduction of soluble polysulfides, while soluble polysulfides remained more oxidized in viscous ethereal solvents. Moreover, XAS revealed that reduced sulfur species chemically react with carbonate-based solvents, making this class of solvents inappropriate for elemental sulfur cathodes of lithium batteries.

Despite the advantage, the utility of LiS batteries is limited by the low electrical conductivities of sulfur and its discharge products (i.e., Li2S2 and Li2S) as well as the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides. Herein, a strategy of covalently grafting sulfur-containing polymers to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is proposed as a solution to the problems associated with sulfur cathodes. The sulfur-containing polymers are grafted to the CNTs using an "inverse vulcanization" method, wherein elemental sulfur is reacted with CNTs that are previously functionalized with isopropenyl groups. A morphological study of the resulting composite indicates that the material maintains the one-dimensional characteristic of CNTs and effectively establishes a porous network via overlap. Such structural features are found to facilitate electron transport in the composite and also suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. When compared to cells that are prepared from elemental sulfur, devices that contain the composite show improved specific capacity (i.e., 1368 mA h g(-1 )at 0.05 C) and a suppressed capacity fading rate (i.e., 0.074% per cycle at 1 C over 500 cycles). In a broader context, covalently attaching sulfur-containing polymers to CNTs provides design criteria for realizing cathode materials that may be employed in high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, Ag-decorated N-doped carbon (Ag-CNx) is prepared through magnesiothermic reduction followed by a "silver mirror" reaction. Attributed to the high conductivity, porous architecture, strong absorbability, and catalytic effect, the as-developed Ag-CNx, as an interlayer material in Li-S configuration, well confines active species within the cathodic side and simultaneously promotes the sulfur conversions bidirectionally to the final S/Li2S product. As a result, fast and durable Li-S electrochemistry can be realized, exhibiting excellent cyclability over 550 cycles, superb rate capability up to 5C, and decent areal capacity of 4.8 mAh cm-2 under raised sulfur loading of 4.1 mg cm-2. This work provides a facile and effective pathway toward multifunctional that combines chemical binding and electrocatalysis, holding great promise in future development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

The primary doped species (pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, thiophenic-S and sulfonic-S) enable this carbon matrix to suppress the diffusion of polysulfides, while the interconnected mesoporous carbon network is favourable for rapid transport of both electrons and lithium ions. Based on the synergistic effect of N, S co-doping and the mesoporous conductive pathway, the as-fabricated C/S cathodes yield excellent cycling stability at a current rate of 4 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) with only 0.085% capacity decay per cycle for over 250 cycles and ultra-high rate capability (693 mAh g(-1) at 10 C rate).

However, the inevitably shuttling of dissolved polysulfides in ether electrolyte and the sluggish redox kinetics still become the obstacles on the way of the commercialization of LSBs. Placing a multifunctional interlayer has been proven a valid method to alleviate the shuttling and boost the conversion of polysulfides. Herein, a germanium (Ge)-doped nitrogen (N)-rich carbon skeleton (GNCS) independent interlayer was proposed through a facile electrospinning technique for LSBs. In this work, Ge nanoparticles, which are embedded in carbon skeleton homogeneously and massively, simultaneously act as catalysts and absorbents for their inherent electronic conductivity and reliable affinity to polysulfides. Meanwhile, the polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-derived nitrogen-rich carbon nanofibers build a threedimensional conductive network for expediting electron transportation of the entire system. The experimental results demonstrate that the LSBs using GNCS interlayers exhibit superior rate performance with the ultrahigh initial capacity of 1680.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, as well as a decent long-cycling performance with high capacity of 755.6 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycling at 1C. This design could not only widen horizons on the usage of metalloids nanoparticles to mediate the activity of polysulfides, but also introduce a facile and practical electrospinning strategy to produce the novel interlayers for realizing the industrialization of LSBs.

However, the strong tendency to self-restack owing to the van der Waals interactions between the MXene layers incurs a massive decrease in surface area and blocking of ions transfer and electrolytes penetration. Here, in situ generated Ti3C2Tx MXene-carbon nanotubes (Ti3C2Tx-CNTs) hybrids are reported via low-temperature self-catalyzing growth of CNTs on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets without the addition of any catalyst precursors. With combined spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculation results, it is certified that the intralayered Ostwald ripening-induced Ti3C2Tx nanomesh structure contributes to the uniform precipitation of ultrafine metal Ti catalysts on Ti3C2Tx, thus giving rise to the in situ CNTs formation on the surface of Ti3C2Tx with high integrity. Taking advantages of intimate electrolyte penetration, unobstructed 3D Li+/e transport, and rich electroactive sites, the Ti3C2Tx-CNTs hybrids are confirmed to be ideal 3D scaffolds for accommodating sulfur and regulating the polysulfides conversion for high-loaded lithium-sulfur batteries.

Despite progress, the poor electrical conductivity and cycling stability of sulfur cathodes still hinder their practical implementation. Here, we developed a facile approach for the engineering of Janus double-sided conductive/insulating microporous ion-sieving membranes that significantly enhance recharge efficiency and long-term stability of Li-S batteries. Our membrane consists of an insulating Li-anode side and an electrically conductive S-cathode side. The insulating side consists of a standard polypropylene separator, while the conductive side is made of closely packed multilayers of high-aspect-ratio MOF/graphene nanosheets having a thickness of few nanometers and a specific surface area of 996 m(2) g(-1) (MOF, metal-organic framework). Our models and experiments reveal that this electrically conductive microporous nanosheet architecture enables the reuse of polysulfide trapped in the membrane and decreases the polysulfide flux and concentration on the anode side by a factor of 250x over recent microporous membranes made of granular MOFs and standard battery separators. Notably, Li-S batteries using our Janus microporous membranes achieve an outstanding rate capability and long-term stability with 75.3% capacity retention over 1700 cycles. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our high-aspect-ratio MOF/graphene nanosheet preparation strategy by the synthesis of a diverse range of MOFs, including ZIF-67, ZIF-8, HKUST-1, NiFe-BTC, and Ni-NDC, providing a flexible approach for the design of Janus microporous membranes and electrically conductive microporous building blocks for energy storage and various other electrochemical applications.

Functionalized bacterial cellulose as a separator to address polysulfides shuttling in lithium-sulfur batteries	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Carboxylate groups; Functionalized separator; Polysulfide shuttling; Lithium transportation	TEMPO-MEDIATED OXIDATION; GRAPHENE OXIDE MEMBRANE; MICROFIBRILS; INTERLAYER; CATHODE; AEROGEL; BARRIER	In lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), soluble long-chain polysulfide intermediates can easily shuttle between the cathode and the anode, causing rapid performance degradation. Although significant progress, through rational cathode structure and composition design, has been made to solve the polysulfide shuttling problem, this challenging issue still exists. Considering the function of a separator in a cell is to isolate the cathode and anode materials, the transport properties of species across the separator should be investigated. Using bacterial cellulose (BC) as an example of a functional separator, we hypothesize that grafting anionic function groups on the cellulose chains could create an energy barrier that will block the diffusion of polysulfides across the separator. In our study, BC is functionalized by oxidizing hydroxyl groups on cellulose chains into carboxylate groups. Physicochemical and electrochemical studies confirm polysulfide shuttling is effectively suppressed. As a result, functionalized BC separator equipped LSB cells with a sulfur load of 4 mg/cm(2) delivers similar to 1,300 mAh/g of specific capacity at 0.1 degrees C, which can be maintained after 100 cycles above 1,000 mAh/g at 0.3 degrees C, demonstrating its superior performance over commercial polyolefin-based separators.

Wet-spinning is introduced to design and fabricate sulfur cathodes based on graphene/MXene hybrid fibers, in which sulfur is uniformly distributed and intimately enveloped between graphene and MXene nanosheets. The high chemical affinity towards polysulfides enabled by MXene is demonstrated by experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The assembled cells show high sulfur utilization (the discharge capacity of 1483.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), high rate performance (733.3 mAh g(-1) at 2 C) and excellent long cycle stability (0.043% per cycle decay at 1 C over 10 0 0 cycles). Moreover, a reversible areal capacity of 5 mAh cm(-2) is achieved under a high sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm(-2), revealing its great potential for practical applications. This study gives a valuable guidance to design advanced sulfur cathodes for high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is critical for achieving high energy density. Here, we developed a soft PEO10LiTFSI polymer swellable gel as a nanoscale reservoir to trap the polysulfides under lean electrolyte conditions. The PEO10LiTFSI gel immobilizes the electrolyte and confines polysulfides within the ion conducting phase. The Li-S cell with a much lower electrolyte to sulfur ratio (E/S) of 4 g(E)/g(S) (3.3 mL(E)/g(S)) could deliver a capacity of 1200 mA h/g, 4.6 mA h/cm(2), and good cycle life. The accumulation of polysulfide reduction products, such as Li2S, on the cathode, is identified as the potential mechanism for capacity fading under lean electrolyte conditions.

To this end, we have designed a 'donut-shaped' cell to enable direct optical observation of phase transformations of a liquid polysulfide catholyte to solid lithium sulfide during electrochemical cycling. We use this technique to image the spatio-temporal distribution of the solid lithium sulfide as it deposits on a carbon matrix at different charging rates. These experiments indicate that the reduction and oxidation of polysulfide catholyte occurs as a thin film deposition and growth process during both lithiation and delithiation. We then investigate the ramifications of these morpological changes in terms of mechanical stability by measuring the evolution of stress during discharge of the polysulfide catholyte. The stress measurements indicate that the average stress during discharging decreases with increasing the charging rate, which we attribute to less dense deposition of lithium sulfide at high discharge rates.

In this work, we design a novel soft template synthesis of acetylene black and MnO2 nanosheets (AB/MnO2) composites by simple and cost-effective methodology. The AB/MnO2 was used as a highly efficient sulfur host for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries. The cheap and highly conductive AB facilitates fast electron transport. The polar host, MnO2 nanosheets, provides chemical interactions and efficiently impedes the dissolution of polysulfide. Accordingly, the cathodes AB/MnO2-S (4:1) and AB/MnO2-S (1:1) with 67 and 70 wt% sulfur content deliver the initial discharge specific capacity of 1326 and 1113 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 837.5 mA g(-1) (0.5 C), respectively. Particularly, the AB/MnO2-S (1:1) cathode shows the most stable coulombic efficiency and cyclability compared with AB/S cathode after 200 cycles. In addition, the AB/MnO2-S (4:1) cathode exhibits a capacity of 1071 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 1675 mA g(-1) (1 C). Along with this green and cost-effective protocol of synthesis, we expect that the AB/MnO2 composites have potential application in advanced Li-S batteries.

In this work, nanosized Li2S particles coated carbon nanofibers are prepared via a solution-based chemical method. Benefiting from this synthetic method, a uniform Li2S layer can be obtained without any agglomeration. Due to the small size of Li2S particles, a smaller energy barrier is observed in the first charging process, which means it is easier to activate the Li2S with a smaller cut-off voltage. In addition, the carbon nanofibers as matrixes could enhance the conductivity of cathode. Moreover, to verify the potential practical application of prepared materials, Li2S cathodes with high loading amount of active materials (similar to 3 mg cm(-2)) are prepared, which show excellent cycling and rate performance, delivering an initial specific capacity of 916.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, and 321 mA h g(-1) capacity still can be reached at 2 C. This good performance can be attributed to the unique solution-based synthesis method, resulting in small and uniform Li2S particles coated on carbon nanofibers. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Instead of synthesizing and dispersing the silica hard templates in advance, we produce the templates in-situ to form the interconnected hollow-sphere structure. This interconnected structure provides a fast and efficient pathway for electron transfer. Meanwhile, decreasing the wall-thickness effectively shortens the distance of ion diffusion, which further promotes the high-rate performances of the interconnected hollow carbon spheres. For supercapacitor applications, at 1 A g(-1), the MF-1.1-20 (with 9-nm wall-thickness) electrode demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 208 F g(-1) and retains 93% of its initial capacity after 10000 cycles. Under a large current density of 20 A g(-1), MF-1.1-20's specific capacity remains 153 F g(-1), demonstrating excellent high-rate performances. In another aspect, as the electrode for lithium-sulfur battery, MF-1.1-20/S composite electrode demonstrates high specific capacity of 996 mAh g(-1) and 465 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and 10C, respectively. The excellent electrochemical behavior of the interconnected hollow carbon spheres demonstrates their potential for applications in high-rate energy storage devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The uniformly TiO2 nanoparticles dispersed in PEDOT matrix improving the electrochemical performance of the ternary PEDOT/TiO2/sulfur composite, which exhibits higher reversible capacity and better rate capability compared with the PEDOT/S and TiO2/S composites. The reversible capacity of PEDOT/TiO2 NCs can be up to 1110 mAh g (1) and was retained 532.1 mAh g (1) after 500 charge-discharge cycles at the rate of 1C, which confirms the good cycling behavior. The superior electrochemical performance of the PEDOT/TiO2 NCs could be attributed to the uniform conducting polymer layer and improving the electrical conductivity of TiO2, the lower charge-transfer resistance and larger lithium ion diffusion coefficient.

Here, yolk-shell zinc oxide (YS-ZnO) spheres are synthesized and for the first time, applied as a host for Li-S batteries to tackle this challenge. The polar ZnO exhibits high chemical anchoring ability toward LiPSs while the unique yolk-shell structure not only provides an additional physical barrier to LiPSs but also enables much more uniform sulfur distribution, thus significantly suppressing LiPSs shuttling effect meanwhile promoting sulfur conversion reactions. As a result, the YS-ZnO enables the Li-S battery to display an initial specific capacity of 1355 mAh g(-1) and an outstanding capacity retention capability (similar to 89.44% retention rate) even after 500 cycles with the average CE of similar to 99.46% at the current of 0.5 C. By contrast, the capacity of conventional-ZnO-nanoparticles based battery severely decays to 472 mAh g(-1) after cycling for 500 times. More impressively, the S/YS-ZnO based Li-S battery can maintain a low decay rate of 0.040% every cycle and high average CE of 98.82% over 1000 cycles at 3 C.

To address these issues, a carbide-derived carbon (DUT-107) featuring a high surface area (2088 m(2) g(-1)), high total pore volume (3.17 cm(3) g (-1)) and hierarchical micro-, meso- and macropore structure is applied as a rigid scaffold for sulfur infiltration. The DUT-107/S cathodes combine excellent mechanical stability and high initial capacities (1098-1208 mA h g(S)(-1)) with high sulfur content (69.7 wt% per total electrode) and loading (2.3- 2.9 mg(S) cm(-2)). Derived from the effect of the electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio on capacity retention and cyclability, conducting salt is substituted by polysulfide additive for reduced polysulfide leakage and capacity stabilization. Moreover, in a full cell model system using a prelithiated hard carbon anode, the performance of DUT-107/S cathodes is demonstrated over 4100 cycles (final capacity of 422 mA h g(S)(-1)) with a very low capacity decay of 0.0118% per cycle. Application of PS additive further boosts the performance (final capacity of 554 mA h g(S)(-1)), although a slightly higher decay of 0.0125% per cycle is observed.

By combining theoretical calculations and experiments, herein we reveal the relationship between intrinsic electronic structure and metal-S bonding strength, which links to energy density and durability of Li-S batteries. Through first-principles calculations, we simulate sulfur clusters (S-1, S-2, S-4, and S-8) immobilization on metal (Cu, Ni, and Sn) slab surfaces with and without graphene substrate. For sulfur clusters, the metal-S-x (x = 1, 2, 4, and 8) bonding strength is in the sequence of Ni > Cu > Sn without graphene substrate. Nevertheless, the sequence changes (Ni > Sn > Cu) in the presence of graphene substrate due to different amounts of charge transfer between these metal clusters and graphene. Guided by these theoretical results, metal (Cu, Ni, Sn)/graphene (G) composites are synthesized and subsequently integrated into the cathode of Li-S batteries. Among these metal/G systems, the sulfur cathode with Ni/G composites demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance, i.e., a discharge capacity of >830 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency close to 100%. These findings shed light on theoretical calculations providing insights into the electrode design of Li-S batteries.

We here synthesized a Co4N mesoporous sphere, which was made up of nanosheets, via an easy and convenient method. This material presents high affinity, speedy trapping, and absorbing capacity for polysulfides and acts as a bifunctional catalysis for sulfur redox processes; therefore it is an ideal matrix for S active material. With such a mesoporous sphere used as a sulfur host in Li-S batteries, extraordinary electrochemistry performance has been achieved. With a sulfur content of 72.3 wt % in the composite, the Co4N@S delivered a high specific discharge capacity of 1659 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, almost reaching its theoretic capacity. Also, the battery exhibited a large reversible capacity of about 1100 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and 1000 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 100 cycles. At a high rate of 2 C and 5 C, after 300 cycles, the discharge capacity finally stabilized at 805 and 585 mAh g(-1). Even at a 94.88% sulfur content, the cathode can still deliver an extremely high specific discharge capacity of 1259 mAh g(-1) with good cycle performance.

In this work, nano-hydroxyapatite (Ca-5(PO4)(3)(OH)) was used as an additive in the sulfur cathode and carbon-coated separator to prevent the polysulfide shuttle effect and thus to achieve the high performance. The sulfur cathode with nano-hydroxyapatite exhibited a higher reversible capacity and a more stable cycling performance than that of the pristine sulfur cathode. The improved capacity retention from 58% (100th) to 73% (200th) after introducing nano-hydroxyapatite into the sulfur cathode confirmed its strong polysulfide absorption ability. Furthermore, a nano-hydroxyapatite modified separator was developed to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect and to facilitate the reutilization of sulfur species. The nano-hydroxyapatite particles served as polysulfide absorbents to bind polysulfides and suppress their diffusion to the anode. The batteries assembled with this separator exhibited a high reversible capacity of 886 mAhg(-1) at 0.1C and 718 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C after 200 cycles, with a low capacity fading of similar to 0.10-0.11% per-cycle. At the highest sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2) used for practical applications, the reversible areal capacity was much higher than the areal capacity (4 mAh cm(-2)) of commercial lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, the strategy using nano-hydroxyapatite as polysulfide absorbent shows great potential for solving the polysulfide shuttle problem and developing high performance Li-S batteries.

Whereas, the inherent issues, including highly insulating character, undesired shuttle behavior and lithium dendrites growth, are seriously impeding its practical usage. Here, a metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) derived N, S co-doped carbon nanotube hollow architecture confining with CoS2 nanoparticles (CoS2/NSCNHF) modified separator is designed to surmount these obstacles. Compared with Celgard separator, this designed separator shows obviously enhanced flame retardancy, giving 73.1% and 53.0% reductions in peak heat release rate and total heat release, separately. Concretely, its hollow structure, conductive feature, electrocatalytic activity and Lewis acid-base interaction enable the efficient inhibition on shuttle behavior as well as boost in polysulfides conversion kinetics. The cell with modified separator delivers a high discharge capacity of 1,284.5 mAh.g(-1). After running for 100 cycles, a discharge capacity of 661.3 mAh.g(-1) is remained. Markedly, the suppression on lithium dendrites growth is also observed, manifesting the enhanced battery safety. Overall, this work may shed light on the effective usage of MOFs-derived hierarchical composite in achieving LSBs with high electrochemical performance as well as safety.

Compared with the CMC/SBR binder, the LA133 binder is found to possess not only higher charge densities (-49.6 versus -38.9 mV) but also better chain flexibility, which promises the homogeneous dispersion of the sulfur-carbon composite cathode materials and ensures an effective conducting framework, resulting in the high utilization of active sulfur. The electrode performance of the batteries further demonstrates that the LA133 cathode with higher dispersion degree delivers lower internal resistance, faster Li-ion diffusion rate, more efficient conversion of sulfur redox, higher reversible capacity (1176.2 versus 867.3 mAh g(-1)), and better rate capability and electrode stability.

Lithium-ion batteries are appealing in this regard, but low-cost, abundant, safe, high energy-density electrode materials need to be developed to adopt them. Here we present a sulfur-multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite cathode with high-rate cyclability by a facile binder/current collector-free fabrication process. The composite cathode exhibits high capacities of 1352 mAh g(-1) at 1C rate and 1012 mAh g(-1) at 4C rate. Due to the self-weaving behavior of MWCNTs, extra cell components such as binders and current collectors are rendered unnecessary, thereby streamlining the electrode manufacturing process and decreasing the cell weight. While the highly conductive MWCNTs improve the active material utilization at high rates, the absorption ability of the cathode framework localizes the electrolyte and suppresses the migration of soluble polysulfides. The cathode design and facile synthesis enhance the feasibility of practical high rate Li-S batteries.

The LiX zeolite membrane was obtained via the in situ hydrothermal synthesis of NaX zeolite over the X-type zeolite-seeded Celgard membrane and the subsequent Li+ ion-exchange. The characterizations of LiX/Celgard separator by means of XRD, SEM, EDS and XPS showed that a continuous and compact layer of LiX zeolite crystals, with a thickness of ca. 6 mu m, has been tightly grafted over the surface of Celgard support. The LiX@Celgard separator was proved to possess an improved electrolyte wettability and high efficiency for inhibiting the penetration of polysulfide (PSs). The electrochemical performance determination indicated that the Li-ion conductivity, diffusion coefficient and transference number were all larger for the battery basing on the LiX/Celgard separator than for that basing on the pristine Celgard separator. The above superior properties of LiX/Celgard separator restrained significantly the shuttle of PSs and improved obviously the efficiency in the utilization of sulfur. At a C-rate of 0.2 C, a specific capacity of ca. 1083 mAh/g, with a capacity retention of 70% after 400 cycles, had been achieved for the Li-S battery employing the LiX/Celgard separator. The strategy adopted in this work can be an enlightenment for the development of ion-selective membranes used in rechargeable battery and other energy storage field.

The separator plays a key role in molecule diffusion and ion transport kinetics; thus, endowing the separator with functions to address the two abovementioned issues is an urgent need. Herein, a protein-based, low-resistance Janus nanofabric is designed and fabricated for simultaneously trapping polysulfides and stabilizing lithium metal. The Janus nanofabric is achieved via combining two functional nanofabric layers, a gelatin-coated conductive nanofabric (G@CNF) as a polysulfide-blocking layer and a gelatin nanofabric (G-nanofabric) as an ion-regulating layer, into a heterostructure. The gelatin coating of G@CNF effectively enhances the polysulfide-trapping ability owing to strong gelatin-polysulfide interactions. The G-nanofabric with exceptional wettability, high ionic conductivity (4.9 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)) and a high lithium-ion transference number (0.73) helps stabilize ion deposition and thus suppresses the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, a Li/Li symmetric cell with the G-nanofabric delivers ultra-long cycle life over 1000 h with very stable performance. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the two functional layers of the Janus nanofabric, the resulting Li-S batteries demonstrate excellent capacity, rate performance and cycling stability (e.g. initial discharge capacity of 890 mA h g(-1) with a decay rate of 0.117% up to 300 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1)).

To facilitate the comparison, a C/S composite based on activated carbon (AC) without nitrogen doping was also fabricated under the same conditions. Compared with the AC/S composite, the NC/S composite showed enhanced activity toward sulfur reduction, as evidenced by the lower onset sulfur reduction potential, higher redox current density in the CV test, and faster charge-transfer kinetics, as indicated by EIS measurements. At room temperature under a current density of 84 mA?g-1 (C/20), the battery based on the NC/S composite exhibited a higher discharge potential and an initial capacity of 1420 mAh?g-1, whereas the battery based on the AC/S composite showed a lower discharge potential and an initial capacity of 1120 mAh?g-1. Both batteries showed similar capacity fading with cycling due to the intrinsic polysulfide solubility and the polysulfide shuttle mechanism; capacity fading can be improved by further cathode modification.

Herein, active transition-metal phthalocyanine compounds are firstly adopted as the electrocatalysts for sulfur cathodes and proved to enhance the cycling stability. Systematic investigations specifically for cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) suggest that the inclusion of CoPc can inhibit the self-discharge behavior and improve the exchange current density of sulfur cathodes effectively. Benefiting from the strong adsorption capability toward soluble polysulfide species, favorable guidance for the formation of Li2S2/Li2S and efficient catalytic transformation of the deposits in the subsequent charging process, the sulfur electrodes containing 3.8 wt% CoPc deliver a specific capacity of 719.6 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 0.2C, 80% higher than those of the pristine ones. A comparative study on CoPc, CoS, cobalt- and Pc-containing compounds confirms that the effectiveness of the electrocatalyst is closely related to the integrated Co-N-4 unit and a probable catalytic mechanism is proposed accordingly.

Enormous efforts have been put on Li-S battery to achieve its commercialization. The function of electrolyte is a key issue in achieving the high performance of Li-S system, and several additives have been tried. But very few works have been working on the electrolyte optimization method with the consideration of over-all performance, including cycling stability, rate capability, especially self-discharge prevention ability, and the consideration of loading condition. In this work, we focus on the incorporation of room temperature ionic liquid (IL) as co-solvent, and the effect of IL in mitigating the polysulfide dissolution via systematical mechanism study of self-discharge phenomena. Moreover, the optimization of IL incorporation ratio is discussed for the sake of the better over-all electrochemical performance of Li-S cell by considering cycling stability, rate performance and self-discharge prevention ability, which is found to vary with loading condition. The improved understanding of the effect of IL on battery performance will help the development of electrolyte for Li-S batteries. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, unsolved challenges and difficulties still remain in suppressing the shuttle effect, improving the conductivity and structural stability of sulfur cathodes. Here, we report a three-dimensional (3D) grid heterostructure VO2(p) (paramontroseite-VO2) nanorod cluster growing on the surface of two-dimensional V2C (MXene) nanosheets as a high-performance catalytic host for sulfur cathodes. The results of first-principles calculation demonstrate that VO2(p) nanorods can synergize with V2C to enhance the adsorption capacity of host for lithium polysulfides in this host structure and reduce the redox reaction barrier in the conversion of polysulfides to short-chain sulfides. In addition, the high specific surface area and structural stability of the host material can increase the redox reaction kinetics and cyclic reversibility of the electrode. The VO2(p)-V2C/S cathode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance and excellent reversible discharge capacity (1250 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2C), long-term cycling stability (69.1% retention at 2C after 500 cycles), and high sulfur loading cycling capacity (initial areal capacity of 9.3 mAh.cm(-2) at 0.2C for 200 cycles). Our research provides a valuable reference for the design of high-performance cathode structures with high sulfur loading.

A steam-impregnation process is applied to fabricate a S@SMGMs composite with homogeneous distribution of sublimed S in the graphene matrix. The S@SMGMs cathode prepared by the steam-impregnation process exhibits higher capacity (830 mAh g(-1) at 8 C) and better rate capability as compared to the cathode obtained from the conventional melt-diffusion process. Good structural integrity of the S@SMGMs composite is well kept after cycling. The outstanding electrochemical properties of the S@SMGMs composite cathode are mainly benefited from the perfect compounding-state between graphene and S, the unique microarchitecture decorated with highly stable porous structure and S doping. Additionally, the contribution of S doping to constraining Li-polysulfides is further confirmed by density functional theory calculations, which indicates that the binding energies between Li-polysulfides and oxided S are higher than that of thiophene-S.

It is found that SiO2 plays an essential role in keeping intact polyhedrons and suppressing particle growth. Benefiting from structural and compositional advantages, the Ni(OH)(2)@S electrode exhibits high specific capacity, excellent rate performance, and stable cycle life at 1C with a small capacity decay of 0.067% per cycle. The Ni(OH)(2) hollow polyhedrons can accommodate the volume expansion to maintain the integrity of the electrode and suppress the shuttling effect of polysulfides via abundant hydroxyl groups. Hence, this strategy is beneficial to anticipate the material for largescale applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The selection of TiN arises from its strong binding ability with polysulfide and its exceptionally high conductivity of 5 x 10(6) S/m. As for N-doped porous carbon, it provides necessary physical adsorption and extra chemical adsorption sites from the N-doping. Besides the above advantages, the most substantial merit endowed to this structure is the pore-loaded TiN design. The carbon pore size confines the TiN precursors to the nanoscale and prevents otherwise subsequent agglomeration of TiN nanoparticles. Moreover, the pore-loaded TiN design, with fully exposed adsorptive surface and highly dispersed adsorptive sites, guards against the blocking of future sulfur infiltration and Li+ diffusion. The advantages of the TiN loaded N-doped carbon are finally confirmed by electrochemical evaluations. The capacity is found up to be 1338 mAh/g at a current density of 0.2 C and 690 mAh/g at a current density of 5 C (where 1 C= 1672 mAh/g). For durability evaluations, the capacity is maintained at 700 mAh/g after 800 cycles with a mere decay of 0.04% per cycle. Lastly, the feasibility of a high mass loading with 7 mg/cm(2) is demonstrated.

The changing of viscosity and conductivity of the electrolyte with different content of PYR14TFSI addition is tested. And the electrochemical impedance, the cycle performance and the columbic efficiency of the Li-S battery with different content of PYR14TFSI additive in the electrolyte are also tested. The results show that the addition of PYR14TFSI can not only inhibit the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx), but also decrease the migration rate of polysulfides ions in the electrolyte. Therefore, shuttle phenomenon in the lithium-sulfur battery is suppressed effectively with the addition of PYR14TFSI. Consequently, a coulombic efficiency nearing 100% and long cycling stability are achieved. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, a conductive and porous nitrogen and phosphorus dual doped graphene (p-NP-G) blocking layer is prepared via a thermal annealing and subsequent hydrothermal reaction route. The doping levels of N and P in p-NP-G as measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are ca. 4.38% and ca. 1.93%, respectively. The dual doped blocking layer exhibits higher conductivity than N or P single doped blocking layers. More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that P atoms and -P-O groups in the p-NP-G layer offer stronger adsorption of polysulfides than the N species. The electrochemical evaluation results illustrate that the p-NP-G blocking layer can deliver superior initial capacity (1158.3 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 1C), excellent rate capability (633.7 mA h g-1 at 2C), and satisfactory cycling stability (ca. 0.09% capacity decay per cycle), which are better than those of the N or P single doped graphene. This work suggests that this synergetic combination of conductive and adsorptive confinement strategies induced by the multi-heteroatom doping scheme is a promising approach for developing high performance Li-S batteries.

Such a dual-functional polysulfides (LiPSs) barrier separator greatly inhibits the shuttle effect from the perspective of physical and chemical interaction. Physically, the inherently electronegative amorphous Al2O3 first achieves the repulsion of LiPSs to the sulfur cathode through the electrostatic repulsive effect, effectively preventing a large amount of soluble LiPSs from accumulating at the separator. At the same time, the Al2O3 film seals the shuttle channel of LiPSs to a certain extent. Chemically, N2 plasma-doped N heteroatoms form a lithium bond with Li+ in LiPSs to achieve the first step chemical adsorption and anchoring of LiPSs. When the LiPSs reaches the amorphous Al2O3 film, more stable chemical bonds are formed between Al3+ and S2-, Li+ and O2-to achieve more effective adsorption and anchoring of LiPSs. At 1C with a high sulfur loading up to 3- 5 mg cm-2 the LSB contributes a specific charge capacity of 717.4 mAh g-1, with high retention rate up to 75.49 % after 450 cycles. The U-shaped electrolytic cell experiment and ultraviolet-visible spectrum experiment confirmed the LiPSs barrier function of the functional separator. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we study the spray processes of viscoelastic jets using simulations and experiments. In discretized modeling, the jet is perturbed with axisymmetric instability and the growth of this instability causes the jet to break into droplets. For the experiments, a solution of polyvinyl alcohol in water is sprayed and is visualized using a high-speed camera. The droplet size distribution is studied from simulations with experiments for three spray cases: electrospray, air spray, and air-controlled electrospray. Our simulations and experiments reveal that the electric field is effective in reducing the droplet size, while air flow offers more jet break-ups and thus a larger number of droplets. As a result, air-controlled electrospray where these two driving forces are synergistically combined leads to a larger number of smaller droplets than electrospray or air spray. Finally, we applied three spray processes to obtain a deposition of sulfur/mesoporous carbon/graphene/polymer binder composites as a lithium sulfur battery cathode and demonstrated that air-controlled electrospray leads to a higher capacity and rate capability than other processes, exhibiting 800 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C and 600 mA h g(-1) at 2C.

Strategies must be adopted to suppress the diffusion of polysulfides into the electrolyte in Li-S battery. In this work, for the first time, we adopt hydrophilic carbon paper anchored by hierarchically porous cobalt disulfides as the interlayer for capturing polysulfides through physical absorption and chemical bonding. Hierarchical pores can physically adsorb polysulfides, and moreover cobalt disulfide can trap the polysulfides by forming strong chemical interaction. The sulfur-graphene composite with a sulfur content of 70.5% delivers a high initial capacity of 1239.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and retains a reversible capacity of 818 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. In spite of a little capacity contribution by the insertion of lithium ions into cobalt disulfide for the initial cycles, it disappears in the subsequent cycling. Therefore, the as-developed porous transition metal disulfides on carbon paper as the interlayer could significantly enhance the cycling performance of Li-S batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The application of lithium-sulfur batteries however has mainly been hampered by the severe shuttle effect of polysulfides during the charging/discharging process. Here, we report the in situ self-assembling of ultra-thin flexible polyaniline layer decorated manganese dioxide nanoparticles (PANI-MnO2) to form a three-dimensional hierarchically porous network as a sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries. The hierarchically porous PANI-MnO2 network not only provides a porous structure to alleviate the volume expansion, but also offers fast channels to accelerate the transfer of active species, electrons and ions to improve the redox reaction kinetics. The as-fabricated PANI-MnO2-S electrode thus demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance, with a stable capacity up to 1195 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C after 100 cycles. In particular, the hierarchically porous PANI-MnO2 network employs an extraordinary chemical process for polysulfides to form active thiosulfates, which are further converted into Li2S. This significantly suppresses the shuttle effect, thus providing the possibility for fast charging. As a result, the PANI-MnO2-S electrode exhibits a discharge capacity of 640 mA h g(-1) at 2C after 500 cycles. Even at a high sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm(-2), a stable areal capacity of similar to 3.12 mA h cm(-2) is achieved at 1C after 200 cycles.

The exposed MnO2 nanosheets vertically aligned on carbon nanofibers provide a large amount of active sites for polysulfide adsorption and conversion. Unlike physical barriers or simple surface interactions, the MnO2 nanosheets generate an anchor and transfer mediator for polysulfides to dissolve into the electrolyte, and then control the deposition of Li2S2 or Li2S on the designed interlayer. This structure induces an arranged relocation of sulfur species during cycling, resulting in a shortened electron passage and an improved utilization of the active material. With a sulfur loading of 1.65 mg cm(-2) and a sulfur content of 60% at the whole electrode level, the cell with the MnO2/carbon nanofiber interlayer delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1102 mA h g(-1), 965 mA h g(-1), and 712 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, 1C and 5C, respectively. It could maintain a reversible capacity of 646 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 1C and a specific capacity of 414 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 5C with a fade rate of 0.04% per cycle.

Effectively anchor the PS should combine the physical and chemical adsorption. However, most of the current studies are focused on confining the PS mobility by physical adsorption alone. Herein, chemical adsorption of the PS is emphasized in a special cell with functionalized graphene adsorbers. Both the experimental and calculated results show that functional groups containing C, N, O and P atoms are beneficial for immobilizing the PSs via chemical bonding, such as C-S, O-S, P-S. Such cells deliver a reversible capacity as high as 1218 mA h g(-1) and cycle stably by solely applying the chemical adsorption, comparable to the current reports mostly based on physical adsorption. Our findings enrich the fundamental understanding of the chemical adsorption of the PS and shed light on the design of sulfur electrodes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, KOH activation treatments were systematically conducted on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to explore the role of each OFG on the performance enhancements of Li-S batteries (LSBs). Results showed that the capacity of activated-CNT-sulfur (a-CNT-S) cathodes is 33% higher than that of the pristine CNT-S cathodes, and their rate capability and cycling stability are also enhanced. And the electrochemical analysis combining with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that the formed C-O bonds are the real factor for the enhanced electrochemical performances of a-CNT-S cathodes. Furthermore, the optimal activation conditions on CNTbased cathodes for LSBs were optimized to be 10 min at 700 degrees C.

Herein, we report an etch-evaporation enabled defect engineering strategy to fabricate atomically dispersed, manganese-nitrogen doped porous carbon (Mn-N-C) for separator modification. With Zinc atoms evaporation and NH3 etch, abundant spatial confinement sites and N dopants are created in Mn-N-C, and the final Mn loading can reach as high as 2.31 wt%. Density function theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mn atoms in Mn-N-C play a crucial role in polysulfides adsorption and electrical conductivity enhancement. Therefore, the Mn-N-C modified separator can exhibit high conductivity, strong immobilization and excellent catalytic activity, thus favoring polysulfides conversion and Li2S nucleation/dissolution. The Li-S battery equipped with the modified separator exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1596 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C (S loading mass was 1.2 mg cm-2), which decays 0.045 % per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1C. Our work demonstrates that the etch-evaporation enabled defect engineering strategy is effective for fabrication of high-performance Li-S battery catalyst; it also shows an attractive prospect to synthesize other high loading metal ion dispersed, nitrogen doped carbon materials for electrochemical applications.

In this work, a 2D sandwich-like alpha-ZrP/polypyrrole (alpha-ZrP/PPy) material with a nanosheet structure was designed as a sulfur host. The material can provide unique ion transfer channels for the rapid transfer of Li+ ions and catalytically promote the conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Moreover, the alpha-ZrP nanosheets provides a true covalent anchor for sulfur species, whereas the PPy builds a physical barrier and forms a conductive network for accelerating the electron transport and promoting the electrochemical performance. In addition, the moderate catalytic activity and true sulfur confinement effect of alpha-ZrP were confirmed by experiments and theoretical calculations. The alpha-ZrP/PPy@S cathode exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 727.2 mAh g(-1) even at a high current density of 5 C, offering a novel cathode material for high performance Li-S batteries.

The obtained pores are three-dimensional and interconnected, and evenly distributed in the carbon matrix. By adjusting the ratio of the raw materials, the high specific surface area and large pore volume is afforded. The obtained HPC-3 samples possess graphite flakes and locally graphited-carbon walls, which provide good electrical conductivity. These unique characteristics make these materials suitable cathode scaffolds for Li-S batteries. After encapsulating 61% sulfur into HPC-3 host, the S/HPC-3 composite exhibits excellent cycling stability, high columbic efficiency, and superior rate cycling as a cathode material. The S/HPC-3 composite cathode displays an initial discharge capacity of 1059 mA h g(-1), and a reversible capacity of 797 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C. The discharge capacities of the S/HPC-3 composite cathode after every 10 cycles at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2C are 1119, 1056, 982, 921, and 829 mA h g(-1), respectively.

The physical and electrochemical properties of the resulting gel polymer electrolyte were investigated. AC impedance spectroscopy revealed that the ionic conductivity of gel polymer electrolyte containing 5 wt% MMT attains a maximum value of 3.06 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature. Li/S cells assembled with the GPE-delivered reversible discharge capacities of 1,418 and 1,071 mAh g(-1) in the first and 100th cycles at 0.1 C, respectively, along with high coulombic efficiency (about 100 %) over 100 cycles. The excellent cycle performance was attributed to the suppression of shuttle effect by the gel polymer electrolyte leading to the higher sulfur utilization in the cell. Even at a high C rate (1 C), the system still delivered 492 mAh g(-1) specific discharge capacity, demonstrating the good ionic conductivity of the GPE.

J	Wang, YW; Huang, PF; Li, CF				Wang, Yinwei; Huang, Pengfei; Li, Chunfeng			Hierarchical porous carbons as sulfur host to restrain polysulfide migration for high-electrochemical performance Li-S batteries	IONICS			English	Article						Hierarchical porous carbon; Capacity; Energy; Cycle performance	LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; ANODE MATERIAL; STABILITY	Due to the high specific capacity and energy density, lithium-sulfur batteries have been recognized as the most promising energy storage devices for electric vehicles. However, they are also faced with some problems, such as poor electronic conductivity and severe polysulfide migration. In this work, hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) are prepared and developed as sulfur host materials in the lithium-sulfur batteries. Due to the hierarchical porous structure, the element sulfur can be uniformly dispersed into the HPCs. Besides, the unique structure also can promote the electron transport and inhibit the polysulfide migration.

Here, a hollow CoS2 nanosphere as a novel electrocatalyst for the cathode host material of high-performance Li-S batteries was obtained by a two-step strategy of solvothermal and sulfuration. Different from the traditional light carbon materials, the tap density of CoS2@S composite material has reached 1.17 g cm(-3). The high tap density of CoS2@S nanospheres composite guarantees the high volume energy density. Specifically, a hollow nanosphere has a large internal space which provides the possibility for a large load of the active material (80.66 wt%). Besides, electrochemical kinetics evaluation indicated CoS2 nanospheres are beneficial for promoting Li-S electrochemical heterogeneous conversion and accelerating the diffusion of lithium ions in the cathode, both of which can help to keep the battery cycle stable and long life. Moreover, the chemical interaction between Co ions and polysulfides can effectively anchor the adsorbed polysulfides, which can help immobilize sulfur species and restrain the shuttle effect. Such a rationally prepared CoS2 nanosphere is significant for promoting the electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode due to high-volume energy density and rapid kinetic transformation promoting action. As a result, the CoS2@S composite exhibits high volume energy density and excellent performance under high sulfur load (4.8 mg cm(-2)) and low E/S ratio (electrolyte/sulfur = 10 mu L mg(-1)) based on of the composite as cathode host materials. This work provides a new idea for the exploration of cathode host materials with high volume energy density and high electrochemical performance for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Since metal cations usually serve as the active sites to interact with polysulfides, optimizing their electronic and valence states is vital to enhance catalytic activity, especially for electrochemical reactions involving multiple electrons. Herein, the electronic and valence states of metal active sites in hollow carbon-encapsulated Ni3ZnC0.7(denoted as C/Ni3ZnC0.7) nanospheres are modulated by introducing either donor defects (P dopants) or acceptor defects (Ni vacancies)viaP-doping or NaBH4-etching, respectively. Such P dopants and Ni vacancies not only endow P-doped C/Ni3ZnC0.7(denoted as C/Ni3ZnC0.7-Pm) and NaBH4-etched C/Ni3ZnC0.7(denoted as C/Ni3ZnC0.7-Bn) nanospheres with abundant defects and distortions, but also modulate the valence states of metal active sites in different ways. P dopants and accompanied Zn vacancies remarkably decrease the electron density of Zn active sites in C/Ni3ZnC0.7-P5 while the Ni vacancies contribute to the dramatic increase of Ni(2+)species in C/Ni3ZnC0.7-B1 nanospheres. The modulated Zn sites could anchor polysulfides and serve as reservoirs to regulate the valence of Ni sites. However, the modulated Ni active sites with more Ni(2+)species enable fast electron transfer between the Ni2+/Ni(0) pair and polysulfides, playing a more significant role in catalyzing the conversion of polysulfides. As a result, compared with C/Ni(3)ZnC(0.7)and C/Ni3ZnC0.7-P5, C/Ni3ZnC0.7-B1 with more Ni(2+)species exhibits stronger chemical adsorption ability toward polysulfides and catalytic ability to accelerate the conversion kinetics of polysulfides. When C/Ni3ZnC0.7-B1 nanospheres are used to modify commonly used PP separators for Li-S batteries, remarkable rate performance up to 4.0C (525.6 mA h g(-1)) and excellent cycling stability (a decay of 0.0179% over 1400 cycles at 1.0C) are achieved.

Herein, we report the design and fabricate of a fishbone based porous carbon (FBPC) for ultralong cycle life Li-S batteries. Prepared by carbonizing the tuna bone with activation process, FBPC is a heteroatoms-doped hierarchical porous carbon material which owns following merits: i) micropores of FBPC confine the dissolved polysulfides and offer adequate electrochemical reaction interface; ii) mesopores of FBPC not only facilitate infiltration of the electrolyte but also accommodates the volume expansion/contraction during the discharge/charge process; iii) the doped N/S/O heteroatoms increase the reactive sites, present strong polysulfides binding and improve the electroconductivity of carbon matrix. Li-S batteries with FBPC separator exhibit excellent cycling stability (0.064% capacity fading per cycle at 1C) and deliver a high discharge capacity of 1397.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C. Even after 700 cycles the capacity still retain as high as 599.9 mAh g(-1) at 1C. These superior performances as well as abundant precursor and facile preparation process represent the promising prospect of the designed FBPC being applied to the high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, graphene itself cannot effectively confine sulfur and suppress polysulfide diffusion, leading to severely fast capacity decay. Herein, nitrogen-doped tubular/porous carbon channels were implanted on graphene sheets (NTPC-G) via a double-template method, with graphene sheets as the shape-directed agents and NiCo-carbonate hydroxide nanowires as the guides of tubular channels. The resultant one-dimensional hollow tubular carbon and two-dimensional graphene nanosheets were wrapped by nitrogen-doped porous carbon layers to construct the unique three-dimensional sandwich-type architectures. The adopted graphene sheets functioned as conductive networks and robust frameworks; moreover, the nitrogen-doped tubular/porous carbon channels comprising hollow tubular carbon and porous carbon coating layers implanted on graphene frameworks served as the sulfur-confined space and polysulfide reservoirs. On integrating these fascinating benefits into one electrode material, sulfur and NTPC-G composites (S@NTPC-G) delivered high rate capability (563 mA h g(-1) at 6 C) and good cycle stability up to 600 cycles. This rational construction of tubular/porous carbon channels on nanosheet materials with comprehensive advantages could be promising and applicable in rechargeable Li-S batteries and other advanced energy storage devices.

In this study, vanadium dioxide (VO2) nanosheets were successfully grown onto CNTs to form CNTs@VO2 through hydrothermal and calcining processes. The hollow structure of the high conductive CNTs offers internal space and mesopores to accommodate the electrolyte combined with the polar metal oxide VO2 nanosheets providing the chemical anchoring. The hollow binary core-shell host acting as the nanoreactor that serves as the modifier of the separator results in the intensive physical and chemical dual adsorption of lithium polysulfide species (LiPSs), promoting the conversion of long-chain LiPSs to alleviate the shuttle effect significantly and boosting the performance. In addition, the CNTs enhance the electronic conductivity and the electrolyte infiltration of the separator. Notably, the modified separator demonstrates a high initial discharge capacity of 1397 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and retains a stable cycling ability with a reversible capacity of 965 mA h g(-1) over 200 cycles at 1C. Even for the high sulfur loading of 7.4 mg cm(-2), it can deliver a high areal capacity of 5.4 mA h cm(-2) at 0.5C.

However, the complicated porous structure and the lithiophobic framework always lead to nonuniform Li deposition and low host utilization. Herein, Au nanoparticle (NP)-modified vertical graphenes, which are grown on flexible graphite paper, are prepared as the 3D host (denoted Au-VG-GP) to guide Li nucleation and deposition. It is shown that the vertical graphene structure with the low tortuosity effectively decreases the ion diffusion resistance and avoids the formation of a concentration gradient, ensuring uniform ion distribution in the 3D host. At the same time, the uniformly distributed Au NPs act as heterogeneous seeds guiding fast and uniform Li nucleation and growth. As a result, the Au-VG-GP host effectively stabilizes the LMA and achieves a high Coulombic efficiency in the half-cells. A small overpotential and long cycling stability are also achieved for the LMA in the symmetrical cells and full batteries with such a host. In addition, such a host can also guide uniform and high-capacity deposition of Li2S in the cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries, showing its potential uses in energy storage devices based on a dissolution-deposition mechanism.

Herein, metal organic framework-derived in situ-developed ZnIn2S4@C is innovatively synthesized to mediate lithium polysulfide (LPS) conversion based on high electron conductivity and strong chemical interactions for advanced LSBs. Polar ZnIn2S4 possesses strong chemisorption in keeping with the DFT calculation results and catalytic for LPSs, ensuring a high sulfur utilization. Meanwhile, the hollow non-polar carbon frame possessing hierarchical pores not only provides internal space to contain active species but also accommodates efficient electronic transferring and diffusion of lithium ions in the process of cycling. The above advantages make the electrode possess promising stability and good rate performances, achieving long-term and high-rate cycling. Thus, under a sulfur loading of 1.5 mg cm(-2), after 500 cycles, at 2 and 5 C, the as-prepared ZnIn2S4@C@ S delivers reversible capacities of 734 mA h g(-1) (75.7% of the initial capacity with a dropping rate of 0.015% per cycle) and 504 mA h g(-1) (68.5% of the primal capacity with a dropping rate of 0.029% per cycle), respectively. Even at a high sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm(-2), at 5 C, 65.6% of the initial capacity can be maintained with a low fading rate of 0.430% per cycle after 500 loops with a high Coulombic efficiency of around 99.8%.

As a conductive matrix for sulfur electrode, it not only increases the sulfur load, but also adsorbs the polysulfide in the hollow structure of the sphere and the mesoporous pores of the shell. And with the beta-Cyclodextrin as the sticking agent, the polysulfide ions are bound to the interior of hollow carbon by surface enveloping, which inhibits the dissolution of active materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption and desorption characterization indicated that porous carbon has a hollow spherical structure with mesoporous pores(pore diameter of 2 similar to 4nm on the surface. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern indicates that the elemental sulfur is uniformly dispersed in the hollow carbon pore structure. The thermogravimetric analysis showed that the sulfur content of PS-hollow carbon/S composite is 74.8 wt.%. The electrochemical test showed that the as-prepared carbon/sulfur composite can deliver a reversible capacity of 1445 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle, and remained above 750 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, indicating that the PS-carbonized carbon/S composite has good electrochemical activity and cycle stability.

In order to fundamentally solve the problem, a well-designed host to simultaneously meet the requirements for both sufficient surface reaction and efficient conversion of polysulfides is urgently demanded. Herein, a 3D heterogeneous sulfur host, termed Ni-ZIF-8@ CC, is fabricated by in situ deposition of nickel-doped zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (NiZIF- 8) on carbon cloth (CC). Spectroscopic investigations show that polysulfides can be strongly adsorbed by the Ni-ZIF-8@ CC host through the synergy between Ni-S and Li-N interactions, which is also verified by DFT simulations. The doped electrocatalytically active nickel species could furthermore significantly facilitate the kinetics of polysulfide redox reaction, attributed to fast lithium ion diffusion and reduced polarization potential. By combining these advantages, the electrodes exhibit a high areal capacity of up to 6.04 mA h cm(-2) together with excellent cycling stabilities.

Li2S encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon for lithium sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							CATHODE MATERIAL; ION BATTERIES; HIGH-CAPACITY; S BATTERIES; CYCLE LIFE; PERFORMANCE; PARTICLES; COMPOSITE; SILICON; CELLS	Using high-energy ball milling of the Li2S plus carbon black mixture followed by carbonization of pyrrole, we have established a facile approach to synthesize Li2S-plus-C composite particles of average size similar to 400 nm, encapsulated by a nitrogen-doped carbon shell. Such an engineered core-shell structure exhibits an ultrahigh initial discharge specific capacity (1029 mA h g(-1)), reaching 88% of the theoretical capacity (1165 mA h g(-1) of Li2S) and thus offering the highest utilization of Li2S in the cathode among all of the reported works for the encapsulated Li2S cathodes. This Li2S/C composite core with a nitrogen-doped carbon shell can still retain 652 mA h g(-1) after prolonged 100 cycles. These superior properties are attributed to the nitrogen-doped carbon shell that can improve the conductivity to enhance the utilization of Li2S in the cathode. Fine particle sizes and the presence of carbon black within the Li2S core may also play a role in high utilization of Li2S in the cathode.

Compared to other approaches via templates, the way we reported is simpler and more economical. Meanwhile, the surface porous structure could form simultaneously. The TiN microspheres with an average diameter of about 1 mu m are composed of tens of nanoscale spherical particles (40-60 nm), which are first applied in cathode as a host material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Due to the hollow and porous architecture and the N-Ti-N bonding unit, the TiN spheres resist the volume changes during charge/discharge, effectively reduce the "shuttle effect", and catalyze the sulfur conversion reaction as well. The cell with TiN microsphere cathode exhibits a large discharge capacity of 692 mAh g(-1)at 1st cycle under a high rate of 5 C, releases the reversible capacity of 740 mAh g(-1)under a rate of 1 C after 400 cycles with a capacity decay of 0.006 % per cycle. These results demonstrate the enormous potential of the TiN microspheres as the host material for high-performance Li-S batteries.

In this work, we prepared the S@PC composites via a facile dissolution-crystallization method and vacuum was used to assist the sulfur crystallization process. Comparing the composites prepared under vacuum and atmosphere, the results show that crystallized sulfur obtains a finer particle size under vacuum condition, which leads to an obviously increase in the initial discharge capacity, rate performance and cycle stability of the battery. The improvement of electrochemical performance is attributed to the fact that the finer sulfur provides quantities interface contact with conductor matrix and sufficient reaction sites between the electrode and electrolyte, accelerating charge transfer and the electrolyte diffusion. This research provides a technical support for the simplified and controllable preparation of cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, ultrafine zirconium boride (ZrB2) nanoparticles of high conductivity is conveniently fabiricated via a solid-state synthesis at relatively low temperature and applied as sulfur host material. The obtained ZrB2/Nitrogen-doped graphene/S (defined as "ZrB2/NG/S ") cathode stably works for 135 cycles at ultrahigh rate of 20 C with capacity of & SIM;400 mAh g(-1). It is worth to note that a long-term cycling performance has been achieved with low decay rate of 0.02% per cycle within 4000 cycles at 5 C. Moreover, the designed cathode delivers an areal capacity of 6.43 mAh cm(-2) upon a high sulfur loading (7.77 mg cm(-2)) with a lean electrolyte at 1C. Investigations including kinetics analysis, deposition/dissolution of Li(2)2S, in-situ XRD, and density functional theory have been further conducted, and the successfully assembled pouch cell shows a high capacity. The high conductivity, strong chemical adsorption, and bi-functional catalytic ability of ZrB2 based composite endow its high potential for practical application.

Its practical application is hindered by the known challenges, including inferior cycle stability and low charging efficiency etc. despite extensive studies in last decades. Most researchers have focused on developing novel host materials for sulfur cathode, protecting lithium metal anode by artificial SEI layers, and structure optimization of Li-S battery. The primary issue is the high solubility of lithium sulfide intermediates (Li2Sn , 3 < n < 8) in liquid organic electrolytes, which results in a "poly sulfide shuttle effect " and rapid capacity fading. Compared with solid-state electrolytes, up to now, traditional liquid state electrolytes are still the most favorable choice for the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Each component of liquid electrolyte, such as solvents, lithium salts and additives, is related to dissolution of polysulfide intermediates and formation of SEI film on lithium metal anode. Motivated by strong demand of the state-of-art electrolyte systems for high performance Li-S batteries, researchers have tried to explore more novel electrolyte systems.

The sulfur composite electrode that was composed of sulfur (29.9 wt%), vapor-grown carbon fiber (VGCF, 9.9 wt%), solid electrolyte (amorphous Li3PS4, 60.0 wt%), and [EMI][TFSI] (0.2 wt%) showed high initial specific capacity of 1270 mAh g(-1) at 25 degrees C, which was calculated on the base of the weight of sulfur. To construct a laboratory-scale all-solid-state battery, amorphous Li3PS4 and meta-stable Li4.4Si alloy were used as solid electrolyte and as negative electrode materials, respectively. The laboratory-scale all-solid-state battery showed good discharge charge cycle performance under a constant current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2) (24 mA g(-1)) at room temperature and retained the large specific capacity more than 1230 mAh g(-1) even after 50 cycles at 25 degrees C.

Exceptional lithium diffusion through porous aromatic framework (PAF) interlayers delivers high capacity and long-life lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							HIGH-PERFORMANCE; CARBON NANOFIBER; POLYSULFIDES; SEPARATORS; POLYMER; ADSORPTION; MEMBRANES; METAL	Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer potential for significant energy density storage gains in concert with the use of sustainable electrode materials. Their cycling stability and slow charging kinetics need significant improvement for deployment in practical settings. Consequently, facilitated transport within the cell is critical for promoting lithium transport whilst simultaneously retarding the movement of polysulfides, which limit the capacity and stability. We have developed a nanoporous interlayer with an ideal pore architecture and surface chemistry that overcomes these challenges. Porous Aromatic Frameworks (PAFs) have uniform 13 angstrom pores and exceptional internal surface areas that can be readily chemically functionalized. Appropriate sulfonation levels (SPAF) within these pores can deliver exceptional lithium ion transport rates, concomitant with the repulsion of unwanted polysulfide moieties. This combination of properties leads to outstanding capacity retention, above 1000 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at practical charge rates. Our high capacity and cyclable battery design is also supported by high coulombic efficiency (av. >99.5%) and sulfur utilization (similar to 96%) as well as excellent lithium anode protection. These remarkable properties have been methodically explored with a suite of analytical techniques that link the battery performance to the fundamental physicochemical properties of the SPAF hybrid interlayer.

Design Principles for Optimum Performance of Porous Carbons in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article							C-RATE; CATHODE; COMPOSITE	A series of experiments is presented that establishes for the first time the role of some of the key design parameters of porous carbons including surface area, pore volume, and pore size on battery performance. A series of hierarchical porous carbons is used as a model system with an open, 3D, interconnected porous framework and highly controlled porosity. Specifically, carbons with surface areas ranging from approximate to 500-2800 m(2) g(-1), pore volume from approximate to 0.6- 5 cm(3) g(-1), and pore size from micropores (approximate to 1 nm) to large mesopores (approximate to 30 nm) are synthesized and tested. At high sulfur loadings (approximate to 80 wt% S), pore volume is more important than surface area with respect to sulfur utilization. Mesopore size, in the range tested, does not affect the sulfur utilization. No relationship between porosity and long-term cycle life is observed. All systems fail after 200-300 cycles, which is likely due to the consumption of the LiNO3 additive over cycling. Moreover, cryo-scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging of these carbon-sulfur composites combined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) provides further insights into the effect of initial sulfur distribution on sulfur utilization while also revealing the inadequacy of the indirect characterization techniques alone in reliably predicting distribution of sulfur within porous carbon matrices.

Herein, bioinspired by the excellent catalytic effect of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) on slicing disulfide bond, we confined commercialized organophosphorus TCEP in the pores of porous carbon nanosheets (PCN) and further modified PP separators by the PCN/TCEP composites. PCN/TCEP decreases the electrodeposition energy barrier, contributing to a uniform corrugated 2D Li2S film other than uncontrollable large Li2S2/Li2S islands. Benefitting from not only the catalytic effect of TCEP on long-chain polysulfide conversion to Li2S2/Li2S but also the promotion of disulfide bond breaking by thiosulfates, which is a by-product of TCEP catalysis, the polysulfide redox kinetics are propelled. The uniform distribution of S species and boosted polysulfides redox kinetics together account for low reaction resistance and stable dendrite-free lithium anode in the Li-S electrochemistry. As a result, by using PCN/TCEP@PP, a high rate performance up to 7.5 C (12.75 mA cm(-2), 503 mA h g(-1) in capacity) and long-term cycling stability (700 cycles at 1.0 C with a decay of 0.0356% per cycle) were achieved. This work provides an insight into interfacial chemistry to control electrodeposition process of S species and inspires more commercial functional interlayer materials for lithium-sulfur batteries.

The well-defined structure is composed of <= 5 layers with 0.62 nm interlayer spacing corresponding to the (002) facial plane of WS2. The composite depicted very strong affinity toward lithium polysulfides. Rapid transport of lithium ions was also revealed. The cathode demonstrated excellent cycling stability and rate capability by delivering a reversible specific capacity of 419mAh g(-1) at 8C after 500 cycles with low capacity fading at 0.04% per cycle. At high sulfur loading of 4.7mg cm(-2) the batteries delivered 3.4mAh cm(-2) areal capacity after 100 cycles at 0.5C. The synergistic effect of strong chemical interaction between lithium polysulfides and WS2, and the superior electronic conductivity of carbon nanosheets are responsible for the enhanced performance. It also suppressed the self-discharge phenomenon by maintaining 94.5% of its initial capacity after 10 days resting. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis demonstrated that even after 400 cycles, the interfacial and charge transfer resistances only increased by 1.2 and 1.7 Omega, respectively, describing faster electrochemical kinetics by inhibiting the formation of insulating layer of lithium sulfide (Li2S) on the surface of the electrodes.

The uniformly decorated ZIF-67 can isolate MXene nanosheets from restacking and leave sufficient Lewis acidic adsorption surface of MXenes exposed. Moreover, it can also provide nitrogen source to dope nitrogen into MXenes, endowing them with improved surface properties. DFT calculation results demonstrate that such nitrogen-doped MXenes have a stronger chemical adsorption capability for polysulfides than pure MXenes. With further assistance of ZIF-67 derived porous carbon, the N-Ti3C2/C coated PP separator (N-Ti3C2/C@PP) could not only efficiently prevent the shuttling of polysulfides, but also successfully suppress the dendrite growth of lithium anodes. Therefore, the Li-S batteries with N-Ti3C2/C@ PP separator exhibit a high specific capacity of 1332 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and an extended cycling stability of 0.07% per cycle capacity decay for 500 cycles at 0.5 C at sulfur loading of 3.4 mg cm(-2). Even at a higher sulfur loading over 10 mg cm(-2), these Li-S batteries still deliver a high and stable areal capacity of 6.3 mAh cm(-2).

When used as sulfur cathode, the S@GHCS composite delivers a high discharge capacity of similar to 800 mA h g(-1) at 4C rate and high capacity retention of 93.7% after 240 cycles at 1C rate, demonstrating much better rate capability and cycling performance compared to those of S@HCS composite.

In this work, we developed a scale-up method to synthesize an efficient cathode material (Co-N-C@KB) with abundant. Co-N-C active sites on the Ketjen Black (KB), through a ligand-mediated-synthesis and a low-temperature-pyrolysis strategy. The uniformly distributed Co-N-C active sites were proved to be favorable for the conversion of polysulfide at the cathode, hence improving the capacity and cyclic life of Li-S battery. As a result, the Co-N-C@KB cathode for the Li-S battery could deliver an initial discharge specific capacity as high as 1 442 mAh.g(-1) and have the excellent capability for capacity retention during the long-term stability lest.

However, the "shuttle" effect in lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is an unresolved issue that can hinder their practical commercial application. Research on LSBs has focused on finding appropriate materials that suppress this effect by efficiently anchoring the LiPSs intermediates. Quantum chemical computations are a useful tool for understanding the mechanistic details of chemical interaction involving LiPSs, and they can also offer strategies for the rational design of LiPSs anchoring materials. In this perspective, we highlight computational and theoretical work performed on this topic. This includes elucidating and characterizing the adsorption mechanisms, and the dominant types of interactions, and summarizing the binding energies of LiPSs on anchoring materials. We also give examples and discuss the potential of descriptors and machine learning approaches to predict the adsorption strength and reactivity of materials. We believe that both approaches will become indispensable in modelling future LSBs.

However, non-conductive nature of sulfur and shuttling effect of soluble lithium polysulfides are intractable remaining problems. Herein, we develop a highly conductive nickel-rich Ni12P5/CNTs hybrid with high specific surface area as sulfur host to address these issues. The polar nature of Ni12P5/CNTs can significantly relieve the shuttle effect by means of a strong affinity towards lithium polysulfides and enhance kinetics of polysulfides redox reactions. In addition, the Ni12P5/CNTs with a superior conductivity (500 Sm-1) and high surface area of 395 m(2)g(-1) enables the effective electron transfer and expedited interfacial reaction. As a result, Ni12P5/CNTs hosted sulfur cathode exhibits high rate capability (784 mAhg(-1) at 4 C) and stable cycling performance with a negligible capacity fading of 0.057 % per cycle over 1,000 cycles at 0.5 C. This work paves an alternative way for designing high performance sulfur cathodes involved metal-rich phosphides.

Nevertheless, the severe shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS) has been one of the major technical challenges causing the rapid capacity fading of Li-S batteries. Herein, we prepare a uniquely designed polyacrylonitrile/poly(acrylic acid) composite nanofiber separator with controllable pore structures and abundant electronegative groups, which is denoted as E-PAN/PAA, to effectively suppress the shuttling effect of LiPS. By a facile electrospinning strategy combined with ethanol steaming treatment, poly(acrylic acid) can be in situ extracted out from the inside of PAN/PAA composite nanofibers to precisely tune the pore structure of the nanofiber separator. As a result, the optimized E-PAN/PAA separator can act as an ionic sieve to allow fast Li+ transport while effectively inhibiting LiPS migration as well, leading to a high initial capacity of 1232 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and a remarkable cycling stability with an ultra-low fading rate of 0.03% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1C. Moreover, the E-PAN/PAA separator presents a remarkable combination of excellent electrolyte wettability, thermal stability and mechanical properties, providing a valuable strategy for the design and manufacture of advanced Li-S battery separators.

However, they suffer from capacity decay and poor coulombic efficiency arising from the dissolution of long-chain polysulfides and their shuttling. A facile and scalable method was developed to directly coat a thin (approximate to 57.3 nm) and porous polyamide (PA) interlayer onto a S cathode by interfacial polymerization. This PA interlayer prevented the shuttling of polysulfides by creating a physical barrier and, through chemical interactions between the amide functionalities of PA and the polysulfides, allowing access to the S electrode by the Li ions. The resulting PA-coated cathode exhibited approximately 64.2 % capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1 C with only 0.0358 % decay per cycle and a moderate capacity of 1008 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C.

A comparison of their nanoscale electrical, electrochemical, and morphological properties was performed with samples prepared by either suspension-spraying or doctor-blade coating with different binders. Morphological studies of the cathodes before and after the electrochemical tests were performed by using AFM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cathodes that contained polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and were prepared by spray-coating exhibited a superior stability of the morphology and the electric network associated with the capacity and cycling stability of these batteries. A reduction of the conductive area determined by conductive AFM was found to correlate to the battery capacity loss for all cathodes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of Li2S exposed to ambient air showed that insulating Li2S hydrolyses to insulating LiOH. This validates the significance of electrical ex-situ AFM analysis after cycling. Conductive tapping mode AFM indicated the existence of large carbon-coated sulfur particles. Based on the analytical findings, the first results of an optimized cathode showed a much improved discharge capacity of 800 mA.g(sulfur)(-1) after 43 cycles.

The sulfur utilization decreased gradually from 74 to 40% with increasing sulfur concentration in this concentration range. Surprisingly, the Li-S cells successfully operated with a considerable capacity (675 mAh/g) even under an extremely high sulfur concentration of 14.2 m. At a high rate of 5.0 C, the cells with 9.8 and 11.5 m sulfur showed much poorer rate capabilities than those with 2.3 and 5.6 m sulfur. This feature was attributed mainly to the significant ohmic drop and large reaction overpotential due to chemical reactions coupled with the electrode reactions of sulfur and polysulfides. In addition, there was a notable variation in the cycle performance with a change in the sulfur concentration. Interestingly, higher capacity retention was observed in 5.6 and 9.8 m sulfur than in low (2.3 m) and high (11.5 m) sulfur concentrations.

The sulfenamide compound is shown to be an effective carbon source to obtain carbon-coated Li2S via post-processing. Both the pristine and carbon-coated materials are characterized by a series of physicochemical methods and preliminarily investigated for application in batteries.

However, the dissolution of polysulfide intermediates and low level of sulfur loading still retard the practical application of Li-S batteries. Here, a self-sacrifice templating strategy is reported to synthesize N/O dual-doped hollow carbon microspheres (HCMs) by carbonization of polydopamine coating carbon nitride hollow spheres. The HCM host is constructed by holey nanosheets in shell with a large surface area (873 m(2)/g) and pore volume (4.84 cm(3)/g), high N/O doping contents (5.36 and 6.99 atom%). Benefiting from the confinement effect, wetting capability, lithiophilic adsorption and catalytic conversion, HCMs-S cathode enables a reversible capacity around 900 mAh/g at 1-2 C and a retention capacity of 530 mAh/g after 900 cycles. HCMs-S also enables an endurance of high mass and areal S loadings (90% and 4.84 mg/cm(2)) with a reversible capacity around 700 mAh/g. Long-term and high-rate cycling does not degrade the homogeneous deposition of nanostructured Li2S at cathode side and dendrite-free Li plating at anode side. This work demonstrates a facile approach to micro-sized C-S grains with desirable three-dimensional architecture composed of two-dimensional building blocks and interconnected mass/charge transport channels for high loading Li-S batteries.

To achieve high performance and safety in Li-S batteries, a flexible and multifunctional integrated interlayer consisting of dual-functional alumina/carbon (Al2O3/C) nanofiber skeleton and organosilicon (OSi) filler is fabricated. Electrically and thermally conductive nanofibers are continuous and interlaced, enhancing the reutilization of LiPSs and the homogenization of temperature gradient through constructed dual-conductive networks. The interval filled OSi helps in the diffusion of LiPSs and the absorption and retention of electrolytes, providing significant support to stabilize the Li-S batteries for long-term cycling. As a result, considerable enhancements in cycle stability and rate performance either under a high sulfur loading of ~5.5 mg cm(-2), low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) rate of 4 ILL mg(-1), or artificial temperature gradients are achieved for a typical sulfur/carbon black cathode simply by incorporating multifunctional Al2O3/C@OSi interlayer. The new design and configuration of the interlayer may practically be used in high-energy applications since it can effectively address severe limitations of the current Li-S batteries.

However, poor conductivity and shuttle effect have become the major obstacles for their development. In the present investigation, we prepared porous biochar-coated metal nanoparticles CoFe@NC/PPC by loading the Prussian blue analogues onto the biomass pomelo peel (PP), followed by calcination. Both rich nitrogen-doped pore structure and CoFe nanoparticles can reduce the shuttle effect in the cycle, and biochar can enhance the conductivity of the sulfur cathode, promoting the complete reaction of sulfur.

However, due to certain limitations, the technology is not ready to be deployed. To overcome some of these, scientists have been extensively employing graphene oxide (GO) or graphene material to improve the electrochemical performance. In this work, we present a unique, novel, and facile method to deposit the active materials onto an aluminum current collector by utilizing the van der Waals interaction between graphene oxide and aluminum via an air-controlled electrospray (ACES) process. The role of conventional polymer binder was replaced by graphene, resulting in a binder-free substrate. We demonstrated that the elimination of conventional polymer binder and graphene layers assembled via the ACES method resulted in higher capacity and retention, and offer almost 4 times higher capacity at 2C than the conventional slurry-cast system with polymer binder. This ACES technique offers potential for improving the overall energy density of sulfur and being adapted for commercialization in the energy storage industry.

This issue is aggravated with increase in sulfur loading, causing low-coulombic efficiency and cycle life. Herein, we present a facile strategy to combine hydrophobic sulfur and hydrophilic, conductive Ti3C2Tz-MXene via one-step surface functionalization using di(hydrogenated tallow)benzylmethyl ammonium chloride (DHT). The latter renders the Ti3C2Tz surface hydrophobic, making it readily dispersible in sulfur dissolved in a carbon disulfide (CS2) solvent. By evaporating the solvent, we conformally coat the DHTTi3C2Tz (DMX) with sulfur. The developed composite, with higher available active area, enables effective trapping of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on the electroactive sites within the cathode, leading to improvement in electrochemical performance at higher sulfur loadings. The DMX/S cathodes function with high sulfur loading of similar to 10.7 mg.cm(-2) and deliver a stable areal capacity of similar to 7 mAh.cm(-2) for 150 cycles. Moreover, a DMX/S cathode in a pouch-cell configuration retains similar to 770 mAh.g(-1) after similar to 200 cycles at 0.2C (85.5% retention). Ex situ studies elucidate the nature of the LiPs-MXene interaction and the effect of surface functionalization towards improved performance.

Herein, such a dense sulfur monolith cathode with a high volumetric energy density of 2067 Wh L-1 and a large volumetric capacity of 980 mAh cm(-3) (of the total volume of cathode) is demonstrated, where sulfur/TiO2 quantum dots (QDs,-3.6 nm) are anchored on nitrogen-rich graphene (S/TiO2-QDs/N-G) and sulfur cathode is densified to a volumetric density of 1.6 g cm(-3) with a conductivity of similar to 270 S m(-1) by drying the graphene hybrid hydrogel. Such high volumetric capacity is one of the best value in all reported sulfur/carbon cathodes. Besides, the monolith cathode gives a superior long-term cycling stability with only 0.06% capacity decay per cycle for 500 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). More importantly, under a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 4.2 mu L mg(-1), the thick and dense monolith cathode with sulfur loading of 5.5 mg cm(-2) displays an areal capacity of 4.92 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 A g(-1). Furthermore, the size effect of TiO2-QDs (anchored on N-G) on electrochemical performances of LSBs and its adsorption mechanism for polysulfides demonstrate the significantly enhancement in discharge capacity and cycling stability of dense monolith cathode derives from the strong capture ability of ultra-small-sized TiO2-QDs for polysulfides. The highly dense sulfur cathode with ultra-small sized sulfur immobilizers (e.g. metal oxides, sulfides, or phosphides) provides a new strategy for designing high-volumetric-energy-density LSBs with superior long-term cycling stability even in lean electrolyte condition.

Herein, to facilitate the conversion of lithium polysulfides, nickel-boron (Ni-B) alloy nanoparticles, dispersed uniformly on carbon nanotube microspheres (CNTMs), are used as sulfur hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries. It is demonstrated that Ni-B alloy nanoparticles can not only anchor polysulfides through Ni-S and B-S interactions but also exhibit high electrocatalytic capability toward the conversion of intermediate polysulfide species. In addition, the intertwined CNT microspheres provide an additional conductive scaffold in response to the fast electrochemical redox. The enhanced redox kinetics is beneficial to improve the specific capacity and cycling stability of the sulfur cathode, based on the fast conversion of lithium polysulfides and effective deposition of the final sulfide products. Conclusively, the S/Ni-B/CNTM composite delivers a high specific capacity (1112.7 mAh g(s)(-1)) along with good cycle performance under both high sulfur loading (8.3 mg cm(-2)) and a lean electrolyte (3 mu L mg(s)(-1)). Consequently, this study opens up a path to design new sulfur hosts toward lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this work, we designed a bimetallic alloyed multifunctional interlayer with multiple adsorption/catalysis sites. The interwoven carbon fibers derived from bacterial cellulose (BC) not only contribute to reducing metal ions to metals but also confine the growth of Co-Fe alloys formed in situ. The metal supported on carbon is very effective for the conversion of LIPSs due to its high adsorption and catalytic sites. In addition, the synergistic effect between Fe and Co species leads to excellent bifunctional catalytic activity. Through detailed electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations, we revealed that CoFe@CNFs has superior electrocatalytic activity, and the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with a catalytic interlayer can deliver satisfactory rate and cycle performance. At a high current density of 2C, the discharge capacity can still reach 627 mAh g(-1). At a current density of 1C, the Coulombic efficiency is maintained at a level close to 100% during the whole cycle process and a satisfying low capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle. More importantly, even if the ambient temperature drops to 0 degrees C, the Li-S battery using the interlayer can still be charged and discharged normally and shows acceptable discharge capacity, which shows that it has good rate kinetics.

High-Performance High-Loading Lithium-Sulfur Batteries by Low Temperature Atomic Layer Deposition of Aluminum Oxide on Nanophase S Cathodes	ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES			English	Article						atomic layer deposition; Li-sulfur batteries; surface coating; sulfur shuttling	GRAPHENE OXIDE; CARBON-BLACK; ION BATTERY; COMPOSITES; AL2O3; ELECTRODE; GROWTH; COATINGS; SULFIDE; FILM	This study examines the effects of nanophase S and surface coatings via atomic layer deposition (ALD) on high-loading sulfur cathodes for developing high-performance and high-energy lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. It is first verified that ball milling is an effective and facile route for nanoengineering microsized S powders and the resultant nanoscale S particles exhibit better performance. Using these ball milled nanoscale S cathodes, it is found that ALD Al2O3 performed at 50 degrees C yields deposits that evolve with ALD cycles from dispersed nanoparticles, to porous, connected films, and finally to dense and continuous films. Moreover, this low temperature ALD process suppresses S loss by sublimation. The ALD Al2O3 greatly improves sulfur cathode sustainable capacity and Coulombic efficiency. This study postulates two different mechanisms underlying the effects of ALD Al2O3 surface coatings depending on their morphology. ALD Al2O3 nanoparticles dispersed on the sulfur surface mainly function to adsorb polysulfides, thereby inhibiting S shuttling and improving sustainable capacity and Coulombic efficiency. By contrast, ALD Al2O3 films behave as a physical barrier to prevent polysulfides from contacting the liquid electrolyte and dissolving. The dispersed Al2O3 nanoparticles improve both sustainable capacity and Coulombic efficiency while the closed Al2O3 films improve Coulombic efficiency while decreasing the capacity.

To circumvent the dissolution of lithium polysulfides and to improve the interfacial properties of the electrolyte with the lithium metal anode, numerous tactics have been employed. Therefore, in this work, hybrid electrolytes composed of room-temperature ionic liquids of different cations with the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI) anion and a nonaqueous liquid electrolyte [1 M LiTFSI in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether/1,3-dioxolane 1: 1 (v/v)] have been prepared, and their physicoelectrochemical properties were thoroughly investigated. The lithium surface upon cycling was characterized by Raman, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The dendrite and shuttle current measurements also indicated the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase and lower polysulfide shuttling between the electrodes. Among the systems examined, the hybrid electrolyte composed of 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium TFSI exhibited appreciable charge-discharge characteristics, better interfacial properties with the lithium metal anode, and increased ionic conductivity which were attributed to the enhanced ion-pair interaction that is present between the 1-methyl-1propylpyrrolidinium cation and the TFSI anion in the electrolyte which was substantiated by Raman analysis.

Our unique chemical solution-based coating technique for an Al thin film on catalytically treated fibrous tissue paper offers a cost-effective sulfur electrode with high electrical conductivity, which is well suited to a scaling up of the sulfur electrode. The cathode with the GNFs/Al-coated Kimwipes not only showed excellent rate capability (497.3 mA h g(-1) at 2C), but also delivered a high capacity of 715.9 mA h g(-1) up to 100 cycles. It also maintained 669.3 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C with negligible capacity degradation, indicating a good capacity retention of 93.5%. Such superior electrochemical performances should be attributed to the finely designed cell configuration: (i) GNFs on the sulfur electrode as a pseudo-upper current collector that directly suppresses the sulfur dissolution; (ii) porous Al-coated Kimwipes with a high electrical conductivity (similar to 0.7 Omega, square(-1)) as a main reservoir which reversibly captures and reutilizes the sulfur species. The proposed concept of the sulfur electrode can give an applicable solution for advanced Li/S batteries.

J	Zhen, MM; Jiang, KL; Guo, SQ; Shen, BX; Liu, HL				Zhen, Mengmeng; Jiang, Keliang; Guo, Sheng-Qi; Shen, Boxiong; Liu, Huiling			Suitable lithium polysulfides diffusion and adsorption on CNTs@TiO2-bronze nanosheets surface for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	NANO RESEARCH			English	Article						lithium polysulfides; Li ion diffusion; adsorption; TiO2-bronze surface; long-term cycling performances	TIO2; CATHODE; HOST; INTERLAYER; SEPARATOR; NANOTUBES; STRATEGY; SHUTTLE	The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) has been hampered their commercialization. Metal oxides as separator modifications can suppress the shuttle effect. Since there is no direct electron transport between metal oxides and LiPSs, absorbed LiPSs should be diffused from the surface of metal oxides to the carbon matrix to go through redox reactions. If diffusivity of LiPSs from metal oxides surface to carbon substrate is poor, it would hinder the redox reactions of LiPSs. Nevertheless, researchers tend to focus on the adsorption and overlook the diffusion of LiPSs. Herein, same morphology and different crystal phase of TiO2 nanosheets grown on carbon nanotubes (CNTs@TiO2-bronze and CNTs@TiO2-anatase) have been designed via a simple approach. Compared with CNTs and CNTs@TiO2-anatase composites, the battery with CNTs@TiO2-bronze modified separator delivers higher specific capacities and stronger cycling stability, especially at high current rates (similar to 472 mAh center dot g(-1) at 2.0 C after 1,000 cycles). Adsorption tests, density functional theory calculations and electrochemical performance evaluations indicate that suitable diffusion and adsorption for LiPSs on the CNTs@TiO2-B surface can effectively capture LiPSs and promote the redox reaction, leading to the superior cycling performances.

As a result, these electrodes require a large amount of electrolyte, normally three times more than the volume used in commercial Li-ion batteries. Herein, a high-energy and high-performance lithium-sulfur battery concept, designed to achieve high practical capacity with minimum volume of electrolyte is proposed. It is based on deposition of polysulfide species on a self-standing and highly conductive carbon nanofiber network, thus eliminating the need for a binder and current collector, resulting in high active material loading. The fiber network has a functionalized surface with the presence of polar oxygen groups, with the aim to prevent polysulfide migration to the lithium anode during the electrochemical process, by the formation of S-O species. Owing to the high sulfur loading (6 mg cm(-2)) and a reduced free volume of the sulfide/fiber electrode, the Li-S cell is designed to work with as little as 10 mu L cm(-2) of electrolyte. With this design the cell has a high energy density of 450 Wh kg(-1), a lifetime of more than 400 cycles, and the possibility of low cost, by use of abundant and eco-friendly materials.

Instrumental analysis shows that the obtained SMPC possesses a unique microporous carbon framework, large specific surface area (3211.2 m(2) g(-1)), high pore volume (1.72 cm(3) g(-1)), good electrical conductivity (1.89 S cm(-1)) and in situ S-doping (2.72 at%). Due to the special physical properties and chemical ingredients of SMPC, the as-fabricated SMPC interlayer for Li-S batteries can not only facilitate rapid electron and Li ion transfer, but can also effectively sequester dissolved polysulfides through combining strong chemical and physical absorption. Consequently, Li-S batteries containing the SMPC interlayer deliver a high initial reversible capacity (1544.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C), superior rate capability (781.2 mA h g(-1) at 5C), and excellent cycling stability (over 500 cycles at 2C with 0.057% capacity fading per cycle). This eco-friendly, low cost SMPC interlayer can offer an appealing alternative for the commercialized production of Li-S cells.

In this work, the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with a compact morphology to block polysulfide penetration is prepared using a simple solution-casting method, and the strategy of incorporating poly(ethylene oxide) and nano zirconium dioxide is applied to guarantee electrolyte uptake and Li+ mobility. Superior to the commercial separator with liquid electrolyte, the LSB assembled with additive-free GPE exhibits a high initial capacity of 1429 mA h g(-1), coulombic efficiency of 96% at 0.2C and improved rate performance. After 500 cycles at 1C, the LSB could still deliver a capacity of 847.2 mA h g(-1), with a low fading rate of 0.05%. The LSB with high sulfur loading (5.2 mg cm(-2)) could attain a high areal capacity of 4.6 mA h cm(-2). Results of scanning electron microscopy suggest that such a hybrid GPE could effectively protect the lithium anode from polysulfide corrosion. Therefore, this novel membrane of hybrid PVDF-based GPE provides a simple and effective method to establish high-performance LSBs.

The preparation consisted of a pyrolysis process, followed by an activation with KOH and a further high-temperature thermal process. TG and DTA were used to discriminate the steps of the activation process, while SEM, XRD, and Raman characterization were employed to evaluate the effects of activation. The activated carbons were tested as electrodes in lithium-sulfur and lithium-ion batteries. The carbonaceous materials coming from cherry stones and walnut shells have proved to be particularly suitable as electrode components. When used as anodes in lithium-ion batteries, both carbons exhibited a high first cycle discharge capacity, which was not restored during the next charge. After the first two cycles, in which there was a marked loss of capacity, both electrodes showed good reversibility. When used as cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries, both carbons exhibited good catalytic activity against the redox reaction involving sulfur species with good cycle stability and satisfactory Coulombic efficiency.

The DBP (dibutyl phthalate) absorption number of the used carbon black has a strong effect on the utilization while the specific surface area is not so critical to it. It was also found that the sulfur particle size is a factor having an effect on the utilization. We have improved the cathode component and achieved the utilization of about 50%.

J	Bertolini, S; Jacob, T				Bertolini, Samuel; Jacob, Timo			Density Functional Theory Studies on Sulfur-Polyacrylonitrile as a Cathode Host Material for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; COMPOSITE CATHODE; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; ENERGY-STORAGE; ANODE SURFACE; PERFORMANCE; METAL; STABILITY; NANOTUBES; MECHANISM	Cyclized polyacrylonitrile, which can be obtained by vulcanization of polyacrylonitrile with sulfur, is an electron-conductive polymer that can be used as a host material in lithium-sulfur batteries. Using density functional theory, we investigated the interaction between a surrounding electrolyte and the polymeric sulfur-polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) electrode. In particular, we focused on different configurations, where the system contains 1,3-dioxane as a solvent and can have (i) polysulfide (PS) solvated in the electrolyte, (ii) a PS attached to the polymer backbone, (iii) lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTF-SI) as a salt dissolved in the electrolyte, and (iv) both PS and LiTFSI dissolved in the electrolyte. We found that the polymer, when having a hydrogen vacancy at a carbon atom (undercoordinated carbon) of the polymer backbone, is able to not only capture a PS from the electrolyte but also decompose and bind to the solvent and/or remove lithium from the PS. During this capturing process, the polysulfide might undergo S-S bond cleavage and recombination, accompanied by a charge transfer between the polysulfide and polymer. Thus, cyclized polyacrylonitrile not only is an interesting host material but also acts as an active material, together with sulfur, by capturing Li from the polysulfide.

Thereby, sulfur particles (d(50) = 24 mu m) are functionalized with polythiophene (layer thickness 100-200 nm) and brought to the surface of the nickel foam by means of composite electroplating while using nickel as a mechanically stable and electrically well conducting binding matrix for sulfur (Ni layer thickness around the sulfur particles < 1 mu m). Therefore, organic nonconducting binders such as PVDF and conducting additives such as carbon are redundant. The method of composite electroplating ensures high sulfur loading with additional surface structuring, while keeping all pores accessible to the battery electrolyte. The naturally high surface of the metal foam is thereby further increased, which helps to decrease local current densities in the battery application. Cross-section SEM micrographs and CT images show that the functionalized sulfur particles are uniformly and densely distributed throughout the nickel foam. A battery capacity of about 300 mA h g(-1) sulfur over 100 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) (0.167 C) for a cathode containing 3.57 mg cm(-2) sulfur is achieved. With an additional 50 nm thin NiSx alloy coating, the utilization of sulfur is improved by 250-300% (a battery capacity of about 800 mA h g(-1) sulfur over 100 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) (0.162 C) for a cathode containing 3.68 mg cm(-2) sulfur is achieved). Furthermore, a high reversibility and rate capability is found when cycled between 0.1 and 1 C, respectively. A stable coulombic efficiency of about 100% is achieved.

However, LSBs practical application is hindered by the severe shuttling of soluble intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and the uncontrollable deposition of insulating Li2S, which limits the active species utilization and decelerates the redox kinetics. In this study, MoO2/alpha-MoC nanocomposite was investigated as a multifunctional electrocatalyst to address above problems. Not only does such electrocatalyst immobilizes LiPSs on its surface but also facilitate the subsequent conversion reaction, further enable the heterogeneous Li2S nucleation and induce three-dimensional precipitation of Li2S. MoO2/alpha-MoC-containing LSBs exhibit excellent rate performance, promising cycling stability, and a high specific capacity of 1177 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and 695 mAh g(-1) at 3 C with a low-capacity deterioration. Good cyclic stability was achieved at 0.5 C even with a high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2) and a low E/S ratio of 6-7 mu L mg(-1) by employing a MoO2/alpha-MoC interlayer.

Herein, a 3D nitrogen-doped graphene composite framework was prepared with spatial dendritic triamines as crosslinking interconnectors, and subsequently employed for Li-S batteries with high efficiency and stability. The nanoscale spatial network of triamine-bonded graphene as molecular spacers can enlarge the interlayer spacing and change surface topography, which allows the nanocomposites to inhibit phase separation and thus capture and homogeneously store well-dispersed sulfur nanocrystals at a high capacity exceeding 70%, even by a solution process. In our work, the composite of S@GO-TAPA as the cathode material delivers the highest initial discharge capacity of 965 mAh g(-1). Besides that, an average coulombic efficiency of 91% is achieved after more than 100 cycles and 66.5% of the capacity remains, even after 100 cycles at 0.2 degrees C. The results suggest that the shuttle effect is remarkably suppressed. Therefore, the design strategy for cathode media is promising for fully solution-processing energy storage devices with printing, coating and spraying techniques.

However, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) upon cycling can result in severe capacity degradation. Achieving high rate capabilities with good cycling stability remains a huge obstacle for the practical implementation of Li-S batteries. Here we developed a novel, multifunctional, hierarchical structure by self-assembling core-shell MnO2 nanorods @ hollow porous carbon with 2D Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, labelled as MCT, as an efficient polysulfide mediator for Li-S cathodes. The integration of the polar MnO2 core and hollow porous carbon shell captures LiPSs two ways: physical confinement and chemisorption. The conductive Ti3C2Tx nanosheets construct a continuous and conductive network, which not only promotes charge transfer and ion diffusion but also boosts LiPS adsorption and conversion. Based on these merits, the MCT/S cathode delivers good rate capability (688 mA h g(-1) at 2.0C) and outstanding long-term cyclability (0.044% capacity decay per cycle over 600 cycles at 2.0C).

Three composites with different S loadings were prepared, subject to two different solvent evaporation rates from acetylene black (AB)/sulfur in carbon disulfide solutions. X-ray diffraction, environmental scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements all show that the porous AB structure is well-filled with S. Composites prepared at a lower solvent evaporation rate with 50 wt % S content, had good electrochemical properties, with 1609.67 mAh g(-1) in the initial cycle and 1115.69 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. Composites with better dispersibility at a low solvent evaporation rate can effectively prevent polysulfide from dissolving in the electrolyte, and serve to stabilize the structure of the S cathode during the charge-discharge process.

This work investigates the catalytic effect and mechanism for polysulfides conversion by cobalt sulfides/carbon nanotubes (Co3S4@CNT) at low temperature of -25 degrees C. In order to find out whether the use of catalysts has an impact on safety, thermal runaway behaviors are also explored. For electrochemical performances at -25 degrees C, the capacity of 1275.6 mAh g(-1) is achieved at 0.1 C and the capacity decay rate can be as low as 0.06% at 0.5 C when running 500 cycles. The capacity reaches 941.7 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and 858 mAh g(-1) even at 2 C. The self-discharge in battery is also relieved. The superior low-temperature performances illustrate the crucial role of catalyst to accelerate reaction kinetics and alleviate shuttle effect. From the perspective of safety, the temperature of thermal runaway occurred in Co3S4@CNT-S button battery is higher than CeS battery. It means Co3S4@CNT can not only accelerate the polysulfides conversion rate and improve the reaction dynamics even at low temperature, but also will not accelerate the occurrence of thermal runaway. These results illustrate that the Co3S4@CNT as sulfur carrier and catalyst play an important role in enhancing the electrochemical performance even at low temperature and improving safety of LSB.

The high energy density results from the conversion mechanism that lithium-sulfur cells utilize. The sulfur cathode, being naturally abundant and environmentally friendly, makes lithium-sulfur batteries a potential next-generation energy-storage technology. The current state of the research indicates that lithium-sulfur cells are now at the point of transitioning from laboratory-scale devices to a more practical energy-storage application. Based on similar electrochemical conversion reactions, the low-cost sulfur cathode can be coupled with a wide range of metallic anodes, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and aluminum. These new "metal-sulfur" systems exhibit great potential in either lowering the production cost or producing high energy density. Inspired by the rapid development of lithium-sulfur batteries and the prospect of metal-sulfur cells, here, over 450 research articles are summarized to analyze the research progress and explore the electrochemical characteristics, cell-assembly parameters, cell-testing conditions, and materials design. In addition to highlighting the current research progress, the possible future areas of research which are needed to bring conversion-type lithium-sulfur and other metal-sulfur batteries into the market are also discussed.

A HfO2/CNT interlayer has an ultrathin, flexible structure with a thickness of 1.5 mu m and an areal density of 0.087 mg cm(-2), along with excellent wettability to electrolyte. The highly conductive CNT network and the catalytic surface adsorption of polysulfide species by HfO2 significantly suppress the polysulfides shuttling phenomenon. With high sulfur loadings of up to 75 wt%, electrodes incorporating a HfO2/CNT interlayer show noticeable improvements in various electrochemical properties, including long-term cycling stability (721 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C), high rate performance (800 mA h g(-1) at 5 C), favorable anti-self-discharge capabilities, and suppression of Li anode corrosion. These results suggest a new and efficient polysulfide trapping material and a viable configuration for high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the composite cathode, the Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 powder is homogeneously mixed with the S/rGO composite to enhance the ionic conductivity. Coupled with a metallic Li anode and solid electrolyte, the designed S/rGO-Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 composite cathode exhibits a high specific capacity and good cycling stability. A high initial discharge capacity of 969 mAhg(-1) is achieved at a current density of 80 mAg(-1) at room temperature and the cell retains a reversible capacity of over 827 mAhg(-1) after 60 cycles. The enhanced performance is attributed to the intimate contact between the S/rGO and Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 electrolyte, and high electrical conductivity of rGO and high ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte.

Dual functionalities such as strong chemical adsorption stability and high conductivity are highly desired for an ideal host material for the sulfur-based cathode. Herein, a uniform polypyrrole layer-coated sulfur/graphene aerogel composite is designed and synthesized using a novel vapor-phase deposition method. The polypyrrole layer simultaneously acts as a host and an adsorbent for efficient suppression of polysulfide dissolution through strong chemical interaction. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the polypyrrole could trap lithium polysulfides through stronger bonding energy. In addition, the deflation of sulfur/graphene hydrogel during the vapor-phase deposition process enhances the contact of sulfur with matrices, resulting in high sulfur utilization and good rate capability. As a result, the synthesized polypyrrole-coated sulfur/graphene aerogel composite delivers specific discharge capacities of 1167 and 409.1 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 and 5 C, respectively. Moreover, the composite can maintain a capacity of 698 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C after 500 cycles, showing an ultraslow decay rate of 0.03% per cycle.

However, the intrinsic insulating properties of sulfur, the dissolution of polysulfides, and the huge volume expansion during cycling still hinder their practical application. We introduced the electroactive polymer poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) into the lithium-sulfur system as a conductive matrix and sulfur reservoir. Using a facile two-step dissolution-precipitation treatment, novel core-shell sulfur quantum dot/PVK (SQD/PVK) nanocomposites were synthesized, in which a large number of SQDs (about 5 nm in size) with plenty of internal void spaces were encapsulated in the PVK shell. The sulfur core consisted of uniformly dispersed SQDs and large void spaces, which formed effective transportation pathways for both electrons and ions among the SQDs. They also acted as a buffer zone to accommodate the volume expansion during cycling and facilitated wetting of the electrolyte. The conducting PVK shell coated on the surface of the sulfur core can restrain dissolution of the polysulfide and suppress the shuttle effect. Galvanostatic testing showed that this SQD/PVK nanocomposite maintained a specific capacity of 687.7 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, corresponding to an 89.7% capacity retention with only 0.05% capacity degradation per cycle. Even after long-term cycling, the electrode could still deliver 488.6 mA h g(-1) at a rate of 0.5 C after 600 cycles and 443.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.75 C after 500 cycles.

Herein, sulfurized carbon nanotube@aminophenol-formaldehyde (SC@A) with covalently linked short-chain sulfurs is firstly synthesized by in situ polymerization of aminophenol-formaldehyde (AF) on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) followed by acetone etching and inverse sulfurization processes, forming mesoporous yolk-shell organosulfur nanotubes with abundant internal joints between the yolk of CNTs and the shell of sulfurized AF for the first time. In situ Raman spectra, in situ XRD patterns, and ex situ XPS spectra verify that the covalent short-chain sulfurs bring about a reversible solid-solid conversion process of sulfur, thoroughly avoiding the shuttle effect. The mesoporous yolk-shell structure with abundant internal joints can effectively accommodate the volume change, fully expose active sites and efficiently improve the transport of electrons and lithium ions, thus highly promoting the solid-solid electrochemical reaction kinetics. Therefore, the SC@A cathode exhibits a superior specific capacity of 841 mAh g(-1) and a capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle within 500 cycles at a large current density of 5.0 C.

Herein, a compact TiO2@VN heterostructure with high true density (5.01 g cm(-3)) is proposed crafted by ingenious selective nitridation, serving as carbon-free dual-capable hosts for both sulfur and lithium. As a heavy S host, the interface-engineered heterostructure integrates adsorptive TiO2 with high conductive VN and concurrently yields a built-in electric field for charge-redistribution at the TiO2/VN interfaces with enlarged active locations for trapping-migration-conversion of polysulfides. Thus-fabricated TiO2@VN-S composite harnessing high tap-density favors constructing dense cathodes (approximate to 1.7 g cm(-3)) with low porosity (<30 vol%), exhibiting dual-boosted cathode-level peak volumetric-/gravimetric-energy-densities nearly 1700 Wh L-cathode(-1)/1000 Wh kg(cathode)(-1) at sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2) and prominent areal capacity (6.7 mAh cm(-2)) at 7.6 mg cm(-2) with reduced electrolyte (<10 mu L mg(sulfur)(-1)). Particular lithiophilicity of the TiO2@VN is demonstrated as Li host to uniformly tune Li nucleation with restrained dendrite growth, consequently bestowing the assembled full-cell with high electrode-level volumetric/gravimetric-energy-density beyond 950 Wh L-cathode+anode(-1)/560 Wh kg(cathode+anode)(-1) at 3.6 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading alongside limited lithium excess (approximate to 50%).

It is proved that the assembly structure of AlCMK makes it "breath" during the redox reaction of lithium and sulfur. Such a novel ability greatly benefits the maintenance of electrode construction during a repeated discharge-charge process. Moreover, a long heating time (e. g. 20 h) at 300 degrees C in a two-step melt diffusion method is found to contribute to the uniform dispersion of sulfur in the AlCMK carbon matrix. Using this featured composite, a Li-S cell retains 627 mA h g(-1) after 450 cycles at 0.1 C-rate with a coulombic efficiency close to 100% and also shows good rate capability up to 5 C-rate, demonstrating a significant improvement of reversible capacity and cycle stability of Li-S cells.

In this study, an efficient electrocatalyst (CNFs@Ni3FeN) is synthesized by anchoring Ni3FeN in the carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The CNFs@Ni3FeN shows electrocatalytic activity and enhances the conversion of polysulfides. After assembling a battery, a high initial capacity (1452 mA h g(-1)) and favorable long-time cycling stability (100 cycles) with a capacity retention rate of 83% are obtained by the electrocatalysis of Ni3FeN. Compared with unmodified CNFs, the cycling stability of CNFs@Ni3FeN can be greatly improved. The catalytic mechanism is further deduced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			A novel fire safety separator decorated by Co2P/Co/C multifunctional layer for Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Li-S battery; Carbon frameworks; Co2P; Shuttling behavior; Safety	HIGH-PERFORMANCE; FLAME-RETARDANT; CO2P NANOPARTICLES; LITHIUM; GRAPHENE; SUPPRESSION; CATALYSTS; COBALT	Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) battery is a potential alternative energy storage system owing to its high theoretical capacity, low cost, and eco-friendly features. However, the commercialization of Li-S battery has been hindered by the notorious "shuttle effect". To overcome the above-mentioned long-standing problem, herein, an advanced separator modified by N and P heteroatoms co-doped carbon frameworks with con-fined Co2P nanoparticles (named Co2P/Co/C) has been successfully prepared. The introduction of functional coating can obviously enhance the thermal stability of separator. To be specific, it showed higher initial decomposition temperature (475) and lower maximum mass loss rate (1.755% 1) values than the Celgard separator (400 and 2.915% 1, respectively). Notably, when kindled separators directly, the modified separator can quench by itself with many residual remains. In addition, the engineered functional layer possesses the capability of capturing lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and then confines them within the cathode region so that the "shuttle effect" can be restrained effectively. After assembling the modified separator in the Li-S cell, compared with the cell with Celgard separator of low initial specific discharge capacity (730 mAh g(-1)), the cell with Co2P/Co/C separator delivered a superior initial discharge capacity of 1310 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C. Also, the modified cell can perform remarkably enhanced rate performances. In addition, As a consequence of these merits, the modified separator with improved thermal stability, preferable fire safety, and satisfied electrochemical performances shows significant guiding value for advancing the practical application of Li-S batteries.

Herein, we propose a compact, high-performance, 2D sulfurized-polyacrylonitrile/graphene (2D-SPAN/G) cathode for practical Li-S batteries. A 2D-SPAN/G cathode with a high active-mass (sulfur) loading of 10 mg cm(-2) is successfully prepared via high-pressure pelletization. In the 2D-SPAN/G cathode, graphene nanosheets function as a robust and conductive scaffold, which uniformly encapsulates SPAN nanoparticles, providing structural integrity and enabling the high electrochemical utilization of sulfur. The combination of the stabilized lithium metal anode, a modified electrolyte (consisting of 1 M LiPF6 and 0.05 M LiDFOB in EMC : FEC (3 : 1 (v/v))) and a 2D-SPAN/G cathode delivers a high areal capacity of 11 mA h cm(-2) and demonstrates outstanding cycling stability over 300 cycles at a high current density of 4 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the excellent electrochemical performance of a scaled-up, pouch-type Li-S battery featuring a 2D-SPAN/G cathode demonstrates the viability of the proposed cathode. The reversibility of the Li+-ion storage mechanism of the 2D-SPAN/G cathode is confirmed using operando Raman spectroscopy.

In this work, the lithium sulfide (Li2S)-oriented composite is fabricated via an in-situ carbothermic reduction method, in which lithium sulfate is reduced by CMK3 at an optimized temperature and subsequently the as-prepared Li2S is protected via the conformal carbon layer by carbonization of phenol-formaldehyde resin (PF). With the aid of the porous carbon structure of CMK3 and protection of PF-derived conformal carbon layer, the dispersity of Li2S and conductivity of cathode are availably enhanced. It has been found that the Li2S@CMK3-C prepared at optimum carbothermic reduction temperature of 835 degrees C has excellent electrochemical performance. The lithium-sulfur battery using Li2S@CMK3-C as cathode and metal Li as anode can deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 979 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, the capacity retention after running at various current density is 94%, and the discharge specific capacity is still 530 mAh g(-1) at 2 C after 450 cycles. Therefore, the preparation of CMK3-supported Li2S-based cathode material provides a new approach for the development and industrialization of new high-performance Li-S battery. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Suppression of the Shuttle Effect in Li-S Batteries via Magnetron Sputtered TiO2 Thin Film at the Electrode-Electrolyte Interface	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						TiO2 thin film; magnetron sputtering; lithium-sulfur batteries; lithium polysulfide; shuttle effect	COMPOSITE CATHODE MATERIALS; ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION; CORROSION-RESISTANCE; SULFUR COMPOSITE; GRAPHENE SHEETS; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; ION; CONDUCTIVITY; CHEMISTRY	The practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is still an issue mainly due to the shuttle phenomenon originating from the migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) between the electrodes, which leads to low Columbic efficiency and rapid capacity fading. In this work, sulfur electrodes are coated with TiO2 thin films via a magnetron sputtering technique at varying deposition times. A stable capacity contribution (66%) from the long-chain to short-chain LiPs reactions is achieved for the TiO2 coated electrodes, whereas a decline from 66% to 62% is observed for the uncoated electrode. This indicates a reversible use of the long-chain LiPs for the TiO2 coated electrodes, representing a more efficient utilization of the active material. Correspondingly, the capacity retention is improved from 68.8% to 88.5% after TiO2 coating. The TiO2 coated electrode delivers a capacity of 570 mAh/g after 120 cycles at 0.1 degrees C, which is 40% greater than that of the uncoated electrode. Similarly, the TiO2 coated electrode delivers a capacity of 427 mAh/g after 170 cycles at 0.5 C, which is 67% greater than that of the uncoated electrode. Analysis of the binding energies of LiPs that are adsorbed on the TiO2 surface by theoretical calculations shows that strong Li-O bonds dominate the interactions between the LiPs and TiO2 layer. It is suggested that magnetron sputtered TiO2 at the electrode electrolyte interface can be effective in suppressing the shuttle effect due to the strong polysulfide adsorbing properties of the TiO2 thin film.

However, its specific capacity and discharge potential need to be further improved to satisfy the urgent demands for high-performance batteries. In this paper, Te0.045S0.955 PAN composite was synthesized by co-heating TexS1-x and PAN, and the superior electrochemical performance to that of SPAN was obtained because of doping Te with high conductivity. The as-prepared Te(0.045)S(0.955)PAN composite possessed the specific capacity of 675 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.1 A g(-1) with high capacity retention of 96.6% compared to the second cycle. Especially, during cycling, Te0.045S0.955 PAN showed average discharge voltages of 1.88-1.91 V, which were higher than 1.85-1.88 V for SPAN at the same current density. Thus doping Te provides a new strategy for increasing the energy density of SPAN. (C) 2019 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Herein, hollow slightly oxidized cobalt phosphides (h-O-CoP) nanoparticles are in-situ implanted into the flyover-type carbon framework composed of the N-doped C polyhedrons threaded with 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on 2D graphene sheets (h-O-CoP-NCG). During the synthesis process, a facile "go-between" strategy and post-heat treatment phosphating technique of the corresponding precursors is implemented to generate abundant electrocatalytic-adsorption sites and provide better electron/ion transportation for durable Li-S batteries. Combining the merits of h-O-CoP active sites and conductive NCG channels, the h-O-CoP-NCG enables stable and efficient sulfur electrochemistry including superior rate capability of -857 mAh g-1 at 4 C and robust cyclability over 500 cycles at 2 C with an average decay rate of 0.033% per cycle. Even under high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm-2), the capacity retention remains 91.6% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. DFT calculations confirm the metallic characteristics of O-CoP (011)-Li2S via the orbital hybridization of the Co 3d-S 2p and the strong adsorption of O-CoP (011) and Li2S6, thereby enhancing the performances of the sulfur cathode.

The as-prepared Mg0.6Ni0.4O hollow nanofibers were used as an additive to prepare sulfur/Mg0.6Ni0.4O composite cathodes. Their crystalline phase and morphologies were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM observation revealed that the sulfur morphology was changed by the Mg0.6Ni0.4O addition, from smooth to rough agglomerated particles. The initial discharge profiles and cyclic voltammetry tests demonstrated the hollow nanofibers of Mg0.6Ni0.4O can not only contribute to reducing the dissolution of polysulfides into electrolytes, but also improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics during charge-discharge process. In addition, the hollow nanofibers of Mg0.6Ni0.4O ensure short diffusion distance for Li+ on interaction in chargeedischarge cycles. The effect of the Mg0.6Ni0.4O hollow nanofibers heat treatment temperature on the S/Mg0.6Ni0.4O cycling performance was also investigated.

In this paper, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived ZnPd alloy nanoparticles with uniform dispersion in a nitrogen-doped three-dimensional carbon framework (ZnPd/NCF) were prepared and used as a separator coating for developing long-cycle stable lithium-sulfur batteries. The synergistic effect of lithium philophile element Zn and sulfur philophile element Pd endows the ZnPd alloy with high catalytic activity for lithium polysulfides, enabling ZnPd/NCF to rapidly adsorb and catalyze lithium polysulfides at high sulfur loadings or current densities. As a result, the Li-S cell with the ZnPd/NCF-coated separator shows an initial capacity of 916 mAh/g at 1C and 1.2 mg/cm(2) sulfur loading, with the specific battery capacity of 627 mAh/g being retained after 500 cycles. Meanwhile, a specific capacity of 1009 mAh/g (5.45 mAh/cm(2)) was achieved even at 6 mg/cm(2) sulfur loading.

However, due to various thorny problems, their commercial production has not yet been realized. The current experimental research normally lacks a systematic investigation into the conversion mechanism of the sulfur cathode from the electronic structure level. Actually, there is still a lack of powerful theoretical guidance for the design of high-performance Li-S batteries and the selection of modified materials still seems blind. In this article, with the chelated Fe-polyvinyl pyrrolidone as the precursor, a series of Fe-based materials (e.g., Fe3O4@C, FeS@C, Fe3N@C) are synthesized as modified layers for battery separators, and the performance differences between them are systematically studied. It is found that the d-p band center model developed based on the d band center can reasonably combine the reaction potential of Li2S4 and performance differences. Simultaneously, the interaction between Li2S6 and the adsorption interface is simulated by ab initio molecular dynamics. This current work sheds light on promising material design for superior Li-S batteries both from a theoretical and experimental perspective.

However, the notorious polysulfide shuttling and the undesired Li dendrite growth impel the development of Li-S batteries. To simultaneously mitigate these problems, a thin (~10 mm) separator is herein developed by coating a-LiAlO2@g-Al2O3 (LAO) nanosheets on the dual sides of a commercial polyethylene (PE) separator. Owing to the high anion-anchoring capability and the polysulfide absorbing and catalytic effect of LAO, the LAO modified separator (LAOMS) not only suppresses the polysulfide shuttling, but also homogenizes Li+ flux and reduces concentration polarization. As a result, the Li-Li cell with LAOMS demonstrates an unprecedented stability over 2500 h when cycled at a high current density of 5 mA/cm(2). In addition, the Li-S battery with LAOMS exhibits superior cycling lifespan with an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.037% per cycle over 1000 cycles even at 2 C, excellent rate performance, and superior anti-self-discharge capability. Our studies not only shed light on the rational design of functionalized separators for high-performance Li-S batteries, but also provide a thin separator with promising commercial perspective.

In this study, a new and efficient strategy for the synthesis of yolk-shell-structured carbon microspheres with multishells is introduced. Pitch-derived carbon microspheres with yolk-shell structure, high pore volume, and high electrical conductivity are synthesized by applying yolk-shell-structured Fe2O3 microspheres as a sacrificial template. Pitch-infiltrated Fe2O3 microspheres transform into yolk-shell-structured carbon (YS_C) microspheres with a specific conductivity of 0.9 S cm(-1) after post-treatment and etching with an HCl solution. The discharge capacity of the sulfur-loaded YS_C microspheres for the 200th cycle at a current density of 0.5 C is 686 mA h g(-1), and their reversible capacity after 800 cycles at a high current density of 2 C is 412 mA h g(-1). In addition, the sulfur-loaded YS_C microspheres show excellent cycling performance, despite their very high sulfur loading of 70 wt%. The excellent cycling and rate performances of the sulfur-loaded YS_C microspheres are attributed to the synergistic effect of the high electrical conductivity of YS_C microspheres, loading of amorphous and ultrafine sulfur, and empty shell layers.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are receiving broad attention because of their high theoretical energy density. However, the large volume change of sulfur during cycling, poor conductivity, and the shuttle effect of sulfides severely restrict the Li-storage performance of Li-S batteries. Herein, we present a novel core-shell nanocomposite consisting of a sulfur core and a hydrogel polypyrrole (PPy) shell, enabling an ultra-high sulfur content of about 98.4% within the composite, which greatly exceeds many other conventional composites obtained by coating sulfur onto some hosts. In addition, the void inside the core-shell structure effectively accommodates the volume change; the conductive PPy shell improves the conductivity of the composite; and PPy is able to adsorb polysulfides, suppressing the shuttle effect. After cycling for 200 cycles, the prepared S@void@PPy composite retains a stable capacity of 650 mAh g(-1), which is higher than the bare sulfur particles. The composite also exhibits a fast Li ion diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, the density functional theory calculations show the PPy shell is able to adsorb polysulfides efficiently, with a large adsorption energy and charge density transfer.

However, the development of MOF-derived carbon materials with hierarchical structures, capable of thoroughly preventing the "shuttling" of polysulfides, is still a major challenge. Herein, we synthesized cobalt nanoparticle-containing porous carbon polyhedra with in situ grown N-doped carbon nanotube (CNT) backbone (NCCNT-Co), using zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as starting material. The obtained NCCNT-Co, with interconnected N-doped CNTs on both inner and outer surfaces, possesses an integrated conductive network, which can further accelerate the transport of electrons/ions inside the whole sulfur cathode. The mesoporous structure derived from the ZIF-67 matrix and the densely immobilized CNTs, coupled with the homogeneously doped N atoms and Co nanoparticles, can efficiently trap lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by physical confinement and chemical interactions. Furthermore, the hierarchical structure of the porous carbon polyhedra enables a high sulfur loading of up to 76 wt.% and can also buffer the volume changes of active sulfur during the lithiation process. As a result, the NCCNT-Co-S cathode delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1,300 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1 C, along with a high capacity of 860 mAh.g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C, with an extremely low capacity decay of 0.024% per cycle.

In this study, functional interlayers consisting of ceric dioxide particle-incorporated carbon nanofibers (CO@CNF) were successfully prepared. These CO@CNF interlayers could not only work as physical barrier for the soluble polysulfide; the presence of CO also provide chemical adsorption for the polysulfide. When the CO particles were incorporated to the carbon nanofibers, 3D channels for the transport of lithium ions and electrons could be formed, which are beneficial for the rapid transport of the lithium ions and electrons. Owing to these superior advantages, the Li-S batteries with CO@CNF interlayer deliver high discharge specific capacity of 1086 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. It also delivers good rate performance and rate capability.

Inspired by the power of biomolecular self-assembly in making delicate nanostructures, we report a novel template-free folic acid (FA) self-assembly strategy to achieve the facile preparation of ultrathin N-doped carbon nanosheet confining single-metal-atom catalysts (M-N-C SAC, M = Co, Ni, Zn, Fe). The 2D association of FA is developed for the first time via the ribbon-like H bonding pattern and metal-FA coordination in a mixed solvent. A tunable metal loading content of the catalysts is facilely realized through a pH-tuned FA partial dissociation chemistry. As a proof of demonstration, Co-N-C SAC shows an excellent performance for lean electrolyte lithium-sulfur battery. Our findinging suggest a new and potentially scalable route for facile fabrication of M-N-C SACs for broad energy storage applications.

Here, a thin molecular sieve film was decorated on the surface of an electrospun cellulose acetate (CA) membrane derived from recycled cigarette filters, where the truncated cone structure beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) was selected as the building block to physically block and chemically trap polysulfides while simultaneously dramatically speeding up ion transport. Furthermore, on the beta-CD free side of the separator facing the cathode, graphite carbon (C) was sputtered as an upper current collector, which barely increases the thickness. These benefits result in an initial discharge performance of 1378.24 mAh g(-1) and long-term cycling stability of 863.78 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 0.2 C for the battery with the beta-CD/CA/C separator, which is more than three times that of the PP separator after 500 cycles. Surprisingly, the funnel-type channel of beta-CD generates a differential ionic fluid pressure on both sides, speeding up ion transport by up to 69%, and a 65.3% faster charging rate of 9484 mA g(-1) was achieved. The "funnel effect" of a separator is regarded as a novel and high-efficiency solution for fast charging of Li-S and other lithium secondary batteries.

Herein, graphene in situ coated TiO2 nanotubes are realized via a direct chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, leading to the design of a graphene-TiO2 (G-TiO2) promotor for Li-S chemistry. With the aid of detailed experimental and theoretical characterization, we reveal that the direct CVD-derived G-TiO2 realizes not only the coupling of Li+-ion diffusion and electron transfer but also efficient regulation of LiPSs, thereby producing a synergistic catalyzing effect on both LiPS conversion and Li2S decomposition. As a result, S/graphene-TiO2 (S/G-TiO2) presents a remarkable rate capability and an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.052% over 1000 cycles at 2.0C. Even at a high sulfur loading of 9.4 mg cm(-2), such a cathode still delivers a superior areal capacity of 8.7 mA h cm(-2). This work would motivate the deep-seated revisiting of the sulfur reaction mechanism and offer a rational strategy to construct high-energy and long-life Li-S batteries.

Carbon-sulfur composites are created by melting and sublimation of sulfur in an isochoric reactor via the autogenic process. These noncrystalline sulfur cathodes demonstrate a high specific capacity of approximate to 1000 Ah kg(-1) after 100 cycles with a gravimetric current of 557 A kg(-1). Interestingly, this high-performance sulfur allotrope lacks a long-range structural order: high-resolution X-ray diffraction, performed at the Advanced Photon Source, indicates the lack of crystalline (i.e., orthorhombic or monoclinic) sulfur in the nanoscale domain. Electrochemical and material characterizations suggest that noncrystalline sulfur is a consequence of synthesis and not necessarily evidence of electrochemical efficacy. Rather, a high rate capacity depends on sulfur distribution, in turn, controlled by synthesis pathway. At higher sulfur content, the performance of carbon-sulfur composites is limited by the available surface area in which crystalline sulfur coincides with reduced gravimetric capacity and greater charge transport impedance, suggesting suboptimal sulfur containment.

However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur, shuttling of soluble intermediate polysulfides between electrodes, and low capacity retention have hampered their commercial use. To address these issues, we use a halloysite-modulated (H-M) separator in a lithium-sulfur battery to mitigate the shuttling problem. The H-M separator acts as a mutual Coulombic repulsion in lithium-sulfur batteries, thereby selectively permitting Li ions and efficiently suppressing the transfer of undesired lithium polysulfides to the Li anode side. Moreover, the use of halloysite switches the surface of the separator from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, consequently improving the electrolyte wettability and adhesion between the separator and cathode. When sulfur-multi-walled carbon nanotube (S-MWCNT) composites are used as cathode active materials, a lithium-sulfur battery with an H-M separator exhibits first discharge and charge capacities of 1587 and 1527 mAh g(-1), respectively. Moreover, there is a consistent capacity retention up to 100 cycles. Accordingly, our approach demonstrates an economical and easily accessible strategy for commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Great progress has been made by using a variety of carbon-based nanostructures for physically and chemically confining soluble polysulfides as well as providing conductive paths. However, most of these electrode designs have a low sulfur content or a low sulfur loading, leading to a low specific capacity or low areal capacity at the electrode level. Herein, intrinsically N- and O-doped carbon nanoribbon (CNR) aerogels, obtained by pyrolysis of bacterial cellulose (BC) aerogels, were employed to form gel-based sulfur cathodes, simultaneously achieving both a high sulfur content and a high sulfur loading. With a sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm(-2) and a sulfur content of 90% at the whole electrode (including the current collector) level, a capacity as high as 943 mA h g(-1) was achieved, which corresponds to an areal capacity of 5.9 mA h cm(-2). The outstanding cell performance is attributed to the gel based cathode structure, which can strongly hold a large amount of the catholyte and relieve the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides.

In this work aiming to solve the existing problems of the lithium-sulfur battery, sulfur@biochar (S@biochar) composite cathode materials with high capacity and good cycle performance were developed. Specifically, four kinds of biochar prepared from rice husk, miscanthus, fir, and pomelo peel were used as host matrices for the Li-S battery. Among them, the S@biochar derived from rice husk delivered the highest specific capacity and the best cycle stability according to electrochemical tests. To further optimize its performance, we prepared a highly porous rice husk derived biochar (HPRH-biochar) using silica gel as the template. The S@HPRH-biochar composite (60% (w, mass fraction) S) enables the homogeneous dispersion of amorphous sulfur in the carbon matrix and its porous structure could effectively suppress the dissolution of the polysulfide. As a result, its electrochemical performance improved, achieving a high initial charge capacity of 1534.1 mAh.g(-1) and maintaining a high capacity of 738.7 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C (1C corresponds to a current density of 1675 mA.g(-1)). It also gives a capacity of 485.3 mAh.g(-1) at 2.0C in the rate capacity test.

However, the battery performances are still not satisfied due to the undesired shuttle effect of polysulfides, the sluggish reaction kinetics, together with the intrinsic non-conductivity of active materials. Thus, the preparation of sulfur host materials with polar, catalytic and conductive properties can be an effective tactics. In this work, a cobalt sulfide@reduced graphene oxide composite has been designed and synthesized by a facile method, in which the CoS nanoparticles can provide more polar and catalytic sites to adsorb the polysulfides and accelerate the kinetics of polysulfides conversion. The rGO can serve as composite skeleton that could not only enhance the conductivity of electrodes, but also provide a sheet structure, preventing the aggregation of CoS nanoparticles. Moreover, the C-S bonds between CoS and carbon can further promote charge transfer and stabilize the composite. Benefiting from the trifunctional sulfur-host, the as-prepared cathode exhibits low self-discharge, good cycling stability and high rate performance for 602.0 mAh g(-1) at 2 C. This sulfur-host design can be considered an effective and simple strategy for advanced Li-S battery.

Nevertheless, the daunting challenges of insulating properties, soluble polysulfide shuttling, drastic volume change and sluggish polysulfide conversion kinetics, still hinder their application towards commercialization. Very recently, exciting progresses have been made on inorganic/organic polar hosts as either polysulfide immobilizers or polysulfide redox accelerators, targeting durable Li-S batteries. Herein, self-assembled NiCo2S4 granules comprising secondary open-hole tubular structures are first devised as highly-efficient host materials for high-sulfur-loading and durable Li-S batteries. NiCo2S4 hosts are featured with their large porosity, high electronic conductivity, rapid ion conduction, strong polysulfide immobilization capability and catalytic effect on polysulfide redox, thus greatly ameliorating the polysulfide-shuttle issue and accelerating the polysulfide conversion kinetics. Therefore, the NiCo2S4/S cathode shows a reversible capacity of 1387 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and retains a value of 543 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 2 C. Impressively, the NiCo2S4/S cathode with a sulfur loading of 8.9 mg cm(-2) exhibits high areal capacity of 8.3 mAh cm(-2), low polarization and high cycling stability. Moreover, the as-derived soft-package battery with a 4.5 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading can power 169 light-emitting diodes, verifying its great potential for practical application.

Herein, an in-situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with high electron-ion conductivity and adjustable three-dimensional (3D) macro-meso-micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, the resulting material has a specific surface area of 2124.9 m(2) g(-1) and a cumulative pore volume of 1.19 cm(3) g(-1). The presence of micropores can effectively physically adsorb polysulfides and mesopores ensure the accessibility of lithium ions and active sites and give the porous carbon material a high specific surface area. The large pores provide channels for the storage of electrolyte and the transmission of ions on the surface of the substrate. The combined effect of these three kinds of pores and the N doping formed in-situ can effectively promote the cycle and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 5 C. After 400 charge-discharge cycles at 1 C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0 mAh g(-1). This new strategy has provided a new approach to the research and industrial-scale production of adjustable hierarchical porous biochar materials.

The microstructure and morphology of the sulfur/MWCNTs composites are characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From the results, it is found that the nano-sulfur (shell) grows around the MWCNTs (core) and is well-dispersed over the whole surface of the MWCNTs. Tested by coin type cells, the composite materials exhibited the sulfur utilization approaching to 78% for the first cycle, the capacity retention closing to 84% after 100 cycles at various rates. The excellent electrochemical performance could be attributed to the nano-size sulfur and the homogeneous distribution of sulfur on MWCNTs matrix, resulting from this novel in situ growth method, which not only enhances the reactive activity of sulfur during charge-discharge processes but also provides stable electrical and ionic transfer channels.

The main challenges of sulfur cathodes are the short cycling life and limited power density caused by the low conductivity of sulfur and dissolution of Li polysulfides. Here we design a new double-hierarchical sulfur host to address these problems. Hierarchical carbon spheres (HCSs), constructed from building blocks of hollow carbon nanobubbles for loading sulfur, are sealed within a thin, polar MoS2 coating composed of ultrathin nanosheets. Experimental and theoretical studies show a strong absorption of the MoS2 nanoshell to polysulfides, and the excellent stability of the MoS2 nanosheets after the adsorption of polysulfides. Moreover, MoS2 promotes the electrochemical redox kinetics in Li-S batteries. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical, hollow and compositional characteristics of the host, the S/MoS2@HCS composite electrode shows a high capacity of 1048 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, good rate capacity and long cycling life with a slow capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle.

Here, we report a novel BN/CNTs hybrid with paragenesis structure, high surface area and O-doping via a one-step co-pyrolysis method. Such paragenesis structure can remarkably lower the contact resistance between non-conducting BN and conductive CNTs, and the O dopant in BN can narrow the bandgap of BN, both imparting the BN/CNTs hybrid a high conductivity of 1884 S m(-1). The BN/CNTs hybrid hosted sulfur shows monoclinic phase instead of the generally reported orthorhombic phase, implying a strong interaction between sulfur and the BN/CNTs hybrid. Moreover, the high surface and the O doping enable BN/CNTs hybrid to adsorb polysulfides with a superior capacity due to the polarization of electrons away from the sulfur atoms towards BN/CNTs. Thus, the BN/CNTs-sulfur cathode can deliver high specific capacity (1374 and 1068 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and 1C, respectively), superior cycling stability (a constant coulombic efficiency of approximate to 99% and a decay rate of 0.045% per cycle along with 500 cycles at 1C) and excellent rate capability (840 mA h g(-1) at 4C). Moreover, it exhibits good high-sulfur-loading areal capacity (up to 4.5 mA h cm(-2)) with stable cell performance.

Many reports have been reported for improving the cycle performances of Li-S battery, such as designing cathode host material, employing functionalized interlayer between the cathode and separator and developing suitable electrolyte. In this work, novel hierarchically constructed TiO2 spheres are prepared and used host materials for sulfur cathode. This novel structure of TiO2 spheres serves as the host material, which could efficiently stabilize the polysulfide at the cathode side. As a result, the shuttle effect of polysulfide in the Li-S battery is greatly alleviated via the hierarchically constructed TiO2 spheres. Finally, the TiO2/S composites display excellent cycle stability and superior rate performance.

In this work, commercially available, low-cost, water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been systematically investigated as a functional polymer binder for high-sulfur-loading cathodes, with the aim of enhancing sulfur utilization, reducing capacity decay, and extending cycling life of the cathodes. In comparison with polyvinylidene fluoride as a conventional binder, PVA shows a valuable polysulfide entrapping ability and a much stronger binding strength. Its superior polysulfide entrapping ability has been verified through theoretical density functional theory calculations and an experimental ex situ adsorption study. In electrochemical Li-S battery performance evaluation, at a sulfur loading density of 3.5 mg cm(-2), the sulfur cathode assembled with the PVA binder displays at 0.5 C a very slow capacity decay of only 0.010% per cycle over 250 cycles. Additionally, the strong binding strength of PVA allows the fabrication of thick sulfur cathodes with a high sulfur loading density of 10.5 mg cm(-2) , which shows a high areal capacity of 4.0 mA h cm(-2) and a high cycling stability (capacity decay of 0.1% per cycle). In consideration of the superior capacity retention and cycling performance of its enabled cathodes, the cost-effective PVA is a promising candidate for highsulfur-loading cathodes in practical applications.

Nevertheless, the dissolution, shuttling and sluggish conversion of soluble lithium poly sulfide intermediates seriously aggregates the cycle life and rate performances of batteries. In this work, a Fe7S8-MoS2 heterostructure decorated on few layers MoS2-embeded N-/P-doping carbon nanocapsule is for the first time developed as high efficient sulfur host for Li-S batteries. This structure offers a practical way to confine and catalyze the soluble lithium polysulfide. In particular, combining advantages with both coupling components, the Fe7S8-MoS2 heterostructure greatly enhances the adsorption abilities towards lithium polysulfide and accelerates their conversion kinetics. Besides, the few layers MoS2-embeded N-/P-doping carbon nanocapsule framework provides sufficient space and abundant adsorption sites to physically and chemically confine soluble lithium polysulfide, effectively suppressing their dissolution and shuttle effect. The synergistic coupling between the Fe7S8-MoS2 heterojunction catalyst and the delicately designed carbon architecture enables excellent rate capability and cycle performances for Li-S batteries. This work highlights the comprehensive material design matrix of dissimilar bandgaps sulfur hosts for future Li-S battery technologies.

With the integration of TiO2 nanosheets to form yolk-shell sulfur-TiO2 (S@void@TiO2) architecture with controllable inner voids, the S@void@TiO2 composite with optimized inner voids provides sufficient contacting sites to improve the utilization of insulating sulfur and allows sulfur to freely expand without destroying the electrode. In particular, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations from molecular level reveal that the hybridization of Li 1s, S 2p and O 2p orbitals ensures the effective chemisorption between polysulfides and TiO2 with long-term cycling stability. Consequently, the optimized S@void@TiO2 electrode maintains a capacity of 766 mAhg(-1) after 1000 cycles at 0.2C. Even at 2C for 400 cycles, the capacity still retains at 511 mAhg(-1), representing the best results of TiO2-based nanostructures for Li-S batteries. This work illustrates that carefully design novel yolk-shell structure is important to address the shortages of sulfur-based cathodes for advanced Li-S battery.

The as-prepared carbon sheet possesses macroporous structure and high conductivity, which is in favor of electrolyte permeation and helps to accelerate the electrochemical kinetics. The cell with the as-prepared interlayer shows superior rate performance and cyclability. Even at an ultrahigh rate (4 C, 1 C = 1675 mA h g(sulfur)(-1)), a discharge capacity of 640 mA h g(-1) is still retained for the cell. Meanwhile, the cell with the as-prepared interlayer exhibits a superior reversible capacity of 811 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, and the discharge capacity retention is over 62%. The excellent electrochemical property probably is attributed to the high conductivity and macroporous structure of the as-prepared interlayer, which contribute to the accommodation of migrating polysulfides accelerating the transfer of electrons and ions, and consequently, enhancing the electrochemical reactivity of the cathode as well as suppressing the formation of the Li2S layer on the cathode.

A novel cathode material of porous carbon films fabricated with colloidal array templates has been investigated. In addition, an electrochemical characterization has been performed aiming on an improved correlation of physical and chemical parameters with the electrochemical performance. The performed NEXAFS measurements of cathode materials allowed for a chemical speciation of the sulfur content inside the cathode material. The aim of the presented investigation was to evaluate the potential of the NEXAFS technique to characterize sulfur in novel battery material. The long term goal for the characterization of the battery materials is the sensitive identification of undesired side reactions, such as the polysulfide shuttle, which takes place during charging and discharging of the battery. The main drawback associated with the investigation of these materials is the fact that NEXAFS measurements can usually only be performed ex situ due to the limited in situ instrumentation being available. For Li-S batteries this problem is more pronounced because of the low photon energies needed to study the sulfur K absorption edge at 2472 eV. We employed 1 mu m thick Si3N4 windows to construct sealed argon cells for NEXAFS measurements under ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions as a first step towards in situ measurements. The cells keep the sample under argon atmosphere at any time and the X-ray beam passes mainly through vacuum which enables the detection of the low energy X-ray emission of sulfur. Using these argon cells we found indications for the presence of lithium polysulfides in the cathode films whereas the correlations to the offline electrochemical results remain somewhat ambiguous. As a consequence of these findings one may state that measurements for battery material characterization are preferably to be performed completely in situ with the electrochemical measurements taking place simultaneously in order to obtain clear and unambiguous results.

Due to the low tap density of porous carbon as a common sulfur host, an excessively high electrode thickness per sulfur loading severely decreases the volumetric energy density to the point of little practical use. For the first time, a sulfur host with an engineered polymodal particle size distribution was utilized for compact high areal capacity sulfur electrodes. This material demonstrated the highest reported blade cast volumetric capacity of 495 mA h cm(-3) at 5.4 mA h cm(-2) while remaining true to traditional blade casting battery manufacturing processes. It demonstrated superior electrochemical activity at 0.1C by delivering capacities of 1010 mA h g(-1) at 10.2 mg cm(-2) and 1350 mA h g(-1) at 4 mg cm(-2) with good stability. Furthermore, even with its thin electrode profile of 86 mu m at 4 mg cm(-2) capacities of 1103 mA h g(-1) and 972 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and 0.5C were achieved, respectively.

Isothermal Sulfur Condensation into Carbon Scaffolds: Improved Loading, Performance, and Scalability for Lithium-Sulfur Battery Cathodes	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; COMPOSITE CATHODES; CYCLING STABILITY; ENERGY-STORAGE; GRAPHENE OXIDE; ION BATTERY; LARGE-SCALE; POLYSULFIDES; ENHANCEMENT; DEPOSITION	Here we demonstrate an isothermal technique that enables rapid vapor infiltration of sulfur into carbon templates to overcome scalability and performance bottlenecks associated with common melt infiltration techniques. Building on straightforward thermodynamic principles of capillary condensation, self-limited sulfur loadings up to 82 wt % can be achieved in as little as 10 min at temperatures between 155 and 175 degrees C. We demonstrate a broad range of device performance criteria using a carbon black-single-walled carbon nanotube binder-free cathode framework, including a side-by side comparison to melt infiltrated electrodes with 74 wt % loading that shows improved capacity (1015 mAh/g vs 768 mAh/g), similar to 92% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, and similar to 98% Coulombic efficiency as a result of enhanced uniformity and conductivity. Further, we demonstrate this technique over a range of different electrodes (1) electrodes with high sulfur loading (82 wt %) with high initial discharge capacity of 1340 mAh/g, (2) electrodes with high areal loading of 8 mg/cm(2) sulfur with >6.5 mAh/cm(2) areal capacity, and (3) electrodes based on carbons with microporous confining pores. Most importantly, this vapor infiltration approach requires over 5x less energy input and enables over 60X greater throughput than standard melt infiltration, enabling integration into roll-to-roll rapid processing schemes without compromising device performance. This technique liberates cost and manufacturing barriers to commercialization of Li-S batteries at larger scales while opening new avenues to infiltrate preformed cathode assemblies with sulfur for assessment at lab scales.

However, achieving high-density M-Nx sites with rational design by a simple method is still challenging to date. Herein, an ultrathin porous 3D carbon-supported single-atom catalyst (SACo/NDC) is synthesized with a salt-template strategy via a facile freeze-drying and one-step pyrolysis procedure and serves well as a sulfur host. The well-defined 3D carbon structure can effectively alleviate volume stress and confine polysulfides inside. Moreover, the dispersed Co-Nx sites exhibit strong chemical adsorption function and valid catalytic efficiency to LiPSs redox conversion. As a result, the SACo/NDC cathodes display enhanced long-term cycling stability and better rate capability.

Here, a multifunctional nanofiber material based on cerium dioxide spheres embedded inside nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (denoted as NCF@CeO2) fabricated by electrospinning technology is used as an interlayer for high-performance Li-S batteries. The nitrogen-doped carbon fiber skeleton matrix provides a through-conducting grid to accelerate electron transfer at the interface of the nitrogen-doped carbon and the CeO2, and the large specific surface area guarantees a sufficient interfacial fast-redox reaction for sulfur species. CeO2 with a hollow structure provides strong physicochemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to weaken the migration behavior, and abundant oxygen defects as catalytic active sites are conducive to lithium sulfide conversion. The "sphere in fiber " construction minimizes the direct contact between the catalyst and electrolyte, effectively avoiding side reactions. Based on the multiple functions of nitrogen-doped carbon fibers and CeO2, Li-S batteries with NCF@CeO2 interlayers exhibit superior electrochemical performances, including a high discharge specific capacity of 1072.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a low capacity decay rate of only 0.063% per cycle after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the mechanisms of LiPSs adsorption-conversion and the quantification of the catalytic ability are elaborately clarified. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the insulating properties of elemental sulfur, huge volume changes, and dissolution of polysulfides in electrolytes that result in the shuttle effect, low sulfur utilization, and low rate performance seriously hinder the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, a composite material of nitrogen-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes and V2O5 was designed and fabricated to serve as the positive electrode of lithium-sulfur battery via the hydrothermal method. The positive electrode of the V2O5@N-CNTs composite material could reach an initial discharge specific capacity of 1,453 mAh g(-1)at a rate of 0.1C. Moreover, the composite material could maintain a discharge ratio of 538 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.5C even after 200 charge and discharge cycles. After 400 cycles, the composite had a specific discharge capacity of 439 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 1.0C. The excellent electrochemical performance of the V2O5@N-CNT/S composite cathode material was due to the fact that V2O5 contains oxygen ions and has a strong polarized surface. Furthermore, nitrogen doping changed the hybrid structure of carbon atoms and provided additional active sites, thereby improving the conductivity of the material itself and effectively inhibiting the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides.

In this work, we reported a nitrogen-rich porous carbon nanotube as the host material for the S cathode. Derived from metal organic frameworks, the carbon host was anchored with isolated cobalt/iron dual atoms, which acted as an efficient electrocatalyst to trigger the surface-mediated reaction of polysulfides. During the discharge-charge cycle of Li-S batteries, the Co/Fe sites work as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to facilitate reversible conversion reaction between S and Li2S. With a high S mass ratio of 72 wt%, S@C composites prepared from the above carbon host are able to deliver a high specific capacity of 1516 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and improved cycling stability (a low capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle after 300 cycles at 0.5C). This work demonstrates a rational strategy to boost the storage performance of the S cathode in rechargeable Li-S batteries.

The further development of Li-S battery, however, is still hindered by capacity decay and kinetics sluggish caused by the poor electrochemical activity and polysulfide shuttle effect. Herein, a nitrogen-doped porous carbon framework is synthesized by a facial strategy, delivering large special surface area and narrow pore size distribution. As a result, the composited cathode with sulfur loading of 62% shows an excellent rate performance and extreme cycling stability (100 cycles at 1.0 C and 457 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 2.0 C), which demonstrates that the N-doped porous carbon host can effectively improve the transport of electron and ion, entrap the dissolved polysulfide, thus improving the electrochemical performance significantly in rate performance and cycle stability.

Among them, TiO2 with (001) facets have been proven to preferably mitigate "shuttle" reactions of polysulfides and improve redox reactions. However, further strategies to promote the (001) facet function are seldom reported. Herein, interfacial active fluorine sites on TiO2 (001) facets were introduced by a facile chemical tailoring strategy for promoting the performance of liquid Li2S6-based Li-S batteries. Due to the F-doping-induced interfacial electron transfer, TiO2 (001) facets not only increased the adsorption ability of polysulfides via interfacial synergistic effects of Ti, O and F sites, but also improved the efficiency of charge carriers in the crystal structure because some Ti4+ ions (d(0) orbital) were reduced to Ti3+ ions (d(1) orbital). As a result, liquid Li2S6-based electrodes (area: 2 cm(2)) supply initial capacities of 1260 and 970 mA h g(-1) and retain 1030 and 500 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.8 and 3.2 mA cm(-2) under 1.0 and 3.0 mg cm(-2) sulfur mass loadings, respectively. This work also demonstrates the interfacial active site effect in high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, it suffers from the lack of direct observation on behaviors of soluble Li-PS in liquid electrolytes. Using in situ graphene liquid cell electron microscopy, we have visualized formation and diffusion of Li-PS simultaneous with morphological and phase evolutions of sulfur nanoparticles during lithiation. We found that the morphological changes and Li-PS diffusion are retarded by ionic liquid (IL) addition into electrolyte. Chronoamperometric shuttle current measurement confirms that IL addition lowers the experimental diffusion coefficient of Li-PS by 2 orders of magnitude relative to that in IL-free electrolyte and thus suppresses the Li-PS shuttle current, which accounts for better cyclability and Coulombic efficiency of the Li/S cell. This study provides significant insights into electrolyte design to inhibit the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon.

However, the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides always compromise the cycling performance of Li-S batteries. Herein, an effective strategy is presented to fabricate high-performance Li-S batteries using a 3D network-like nanocomposite of Co/NCNS/CNT, which is obtained via the well-distributed composition of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (in situ formed and added) with nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (NCNS) as well as Co nanoparticles from carbonization of the nitrogen-rich bio-MOF-100 nanosheets at an inert atmosphere. Owing to good sulphiphilicity, excellent conductivity and high catalytic activity from Co-N-x and Co nanoparticles, Co/NCNS/CNT nanocomposite could effectively adsorb and catalyze the fast conversion of lithium polysulfides. When serving as the separator coating for Li-S cells, the cell shows excellent performances with an initial capacity of 972.4 mAh/g at 2C under a sulfur loading of 2.0 mg/cm(2), and excellent cycling stability with the capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle during the 1000 long-term cycles. Furthermore, even at a high sulfur loading of 5 mg/cm(2), the specific capacity of 522.1 mAh/g (2.61 mAh/cm(2)) can be maintained after 500 cycles at 1 C, thus providing a promising path toward advanced Li-S batteries.

Electrochemical impedance analysis of polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated sulfur/reduced graphene oxide (S/rGO) electrode	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS			English	Article						sulfur; rGO; PVP; coating; dissolution-crystallization; lithium-sulfur battery	LITHIUM; BATTERY; NANOPARTICLES; IMPROVEMENT; REDUCTION; PARTICLES	In this study, polyvinylpyrrolidone sulfur/reduced graphene oxide (S/rGO@PVP) composite for lithium-sulfur batteries was produced. Reduced graphene oxide is used to improve the conductivity of both ionic and electronic conductivity due to poor sulfur conductivity (5 x 10(-30) S cm(-1)). Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized using modified Marcano and Hummer methods. Sulfur (S8) was prepared using the dissolution-crystallization method followed by microwave treatment to reduce the graphene oxide and sulfur impregnation into a graphene oxide reduction structure (rGO). Addition of PVP was varied at 0, 50, 67, and 75 wt% of S/rGO, with variation of microwave time at 10, 20, and 30 min. The x-ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern showed that sulfur and PVP crystals had been formed. Morphological characterization using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed a structure of thin layers of the rGO with small layers of PVP, while Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) showed black dots that are characteristic of sulfur particles. TEM showed that the sulfur particles had an average size of 12.8 nm. The C-S bond in the FTIR spectrum indicates that there was an S bond in the rGO. The EIS measurement showed a tendency of adding PVP mass, which increased the value of charge transfer resistance (R-ct). On the other hand, four-point probe measurements showed that the addition of PVP mass can also decrease the conductivity. Meanwhile, microwave radiation also affects R-ct. The addition of microwave radiation time decreases the value of R-ct and increases the conductivity of the sample.	[Iskandar, F.; Setiawan, B.; Marion, A.

Here, we report that Ni hexatomic clusters embedded in a nitrogen-doped three-dimensional (3D) graphene framework (Ni-N/G) possess stronger interaction with soluble polysulfides than that with insoluble polysulfides. The synthetic electrocatalyst deployed in the sulfur cathode plays a multifunctional role: (i) selectively adsorbing the polysulfides dissolved in the electrolyte, (ii) expediting the sluggish liquid-solid phase transformations at the active sites as electrocatalysts, and (iii) accelerating the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction of multielectron sulfur, thereby inhibiting the dissolution of LiPSs. The constructed S@Ni-N/G cathode delivers an areal capacity of 9.43 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C at S loading of 6.8 mg cm(-2), and it exhibits a gravimetric capacity of 1104 mAh g(-1) with a capacity fading rate of 0.045% per cycle over 50 cycles at 0.2 C at S loading of 2.0 mg cm(-2). This work opens a rational approach to achieve the selective adsorption and expediting of polysulfide transition for the performance enhancement of Li-S batteries.

However, the lithium-sulfur batteries show poor electrochemical performance, caused by the polysulfide dissolution and low electrical conductivities of the sulfur cathode. Herein, we develop a new strategy to solving these two issues by designing titanium dioxide embed carbon nanofibers/S (CNFs@TO/S) hybrid composites. In this unique hybrid structure, the mesoporous 3D carbon nanofibers could provide fast electron conduction paths and structural stability. The titanium dioxide could act as polysulfide absorber via chemical bond between TiO2 and polysulfide. Owing to these synthetic effect, the as-prepared CNFs@TO/S cathodes exhibit advanced electrochemical performances.

Among them, poly(diallyl tetrasulfide) (PDATtS) delivered a high capacity of 700 mAh g(-1), stable capacity retention of 85% after 300 cycles, high areal capacity similar to 4 mAh cm(-2) for electrode with up to 10.3 mg cm(-2) loading. New insight into the reaction mechanism of PDATtS electrode that radicals arisen from the homolytic cleavage of S - S bond in PDATtS reacted with Li+ to generate thiolates (RSLi) and insoluble lithium sulfides (Li2S) or lithium disulfide (Li2S2) was clearly verified by in-situ UV/Vis spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Therefore, based on the unique reaction mechanism, problems of rapid capacity fading due to the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates and their serious shuttle effect in conventional lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries was totally avoided, realizing the dendrite-free lithium sulfur batteries. This study sets new trends for avenues of further research to advance Li - S battery technologies. (C) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

J	Yanilmaz, M				Yanilmaz, Meltem			TiO2-decorated porous carbon nanofiber interlayer for Li-S batteries	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							RATIONAL DESIGN; LITHIUM; CATHODE; SEPARATOR; COMPOSITE; MEMBRANE; PAPER	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are the most promising energy storage systems owing to their high energy density. However, shuttling of polysulfides detracts the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries and thus prevents the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Here, TiO2@porous carbon nanofibers (TiO2@PCNFs) are fabricatedviacombining electrospinning and electrospraying techniques and the resultant TiO2@PCNFs are evaluated for use as an interlayer in Li-S batteries. TiO(2)nanoparticles on PCNFs are observed from SEM and TEM images. A high initial discharge capacity of 1510 mA h g(-1)is achieved owing to the novel approach of electrospinning the carbon precursor and electrospraying TiO(2)nanoparticles simultaneously. In this approach TiO(2)nanoparticles capture polysulfides with strong interaction and the PCNFs with high conductivity recycle and re-use the adsorbed polysulfides, thus leading to high reversible capacity and stable cycling performance. A high reversible capacity of 967 mA h g(-1)is reached after 200 cycles at 0.2C. The cell with the TiO2@PCNF interlayer also delivers a reversible capacity of around 1100 mA h g(-1)at 1C, while the cell without the interlayer exhibits a lower capacity of 400 mA h g(-1). Therefore, this work presents a novel approach for designing interlayer materials with exceptional electrochemical performance for high performance Li-S batteries.

Importantly, the cell with the electrically isolated sulfur particles confined between two separators shows very normal operation even during the first cycle and provides the same result as a conventional cell after several cycles. Based on the controlled potentiostatic and galvanostatic experiments, we propose a reasonable reaction route: a portion of the electrically isolated solid sulfur (S-8) is dissolved in the electrolyte solution to form sulfur molecules, which can be electrochemically reduced to polysulfides on the carbon surface.

In order to overcome its poor conductivity, Li2S is often compounded with carbon materials. However, the composites prepared by the traditional physical mixing method have low loading content, poor dispersion, large particle size of Li2S and lack of binding effects for polysulfides shuttle. Herein, we prepare nano-sized Li2S/graphene aerogel composite by in-situ lithiation of nano-S precursor. The Li2S loading in this composite is high (69.0 wt%) and variable, the nanoscaled particle size (ca. 10 nm) retains well from the elemental S precursor and disperses evenly on the three-dimensional porous graphene aerogel. More importantly, C-O-S chemical bonding is retained between Li2S and graphene skeleton, thus the dissolution of polysulfide species and the shuttle effect can be effectively suppressed. After the lithiation process, the specific surface area is also unexpectedly increased by a factor of 10, greatly improving the lithium ion transport path, and contributing to an increase in rate performance. As a result, the in-situ lithiated Li2S/graphene aerogel composite exhibits higher specific capacity and stability compared to that via ex-situ infiltration route. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Raman spectra indicated an enhanced trend of the degree of graphitization of the PDA-C samples with increasing calcination temperature. The surface area of the PDA-C samples increases with amount of the KOH in the pore-creating process. The graphitized porous N-doped carbon provides the high electronic conductive network. Meanwhile, the PDA-C with high surface area and uniform micropores ensures a high interaction toward sulfur as well as the high dispersion of nanoscale sulfur layer on it. The microporous PDA-C@S cathode material exhibits the excellent high rate discharge capability (636 mA h g(-1) at 2.0 C) and good low/high-rate cycling stability (893 mA h g(-1) (0.5 C) and 608 mA h g(-1) (2.0 C) over 100 and 300 cycles). Cyclic voltammogram curves and electrochemical impedance plots show that both the impedance and polarization of the cells increase with decreasing pore size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For EV applications, the areal capacity of LSBs needs reach 5 mAh cm(-2) to compete with the state-of-the-art LIBs. However, the practical application of LSB has been hindered by the gap in scientific knowledge between the fundamental research and application requirement such as high sulfur loading (over 5 mg cm(-2)). Moreover, notorious "shuffle effect", sluggish redox kinetics and non-ignorable safety issues impede its rapid development, which will become more serious with high sulfur loading. Thus numerous researchers have focused on areal capacity and safety at high sulfur loading. In this review, the fundamental studies and current development strategies for high sulfur loading LSBs are reviewed mainly including LiPSs anchoring, electrocatalytic effect and overall security strategy. For LiPSs anchoring strategy, the function mechanism includes physical adsorption/barrier, chemical anchor and electrostatic interaction. For electrocatalytic strategy, 0D nanoparticles/nanospheres, 1D nanofibers/nanowires, 2D nanosheets/ nanoflakes and 3D catalytic materials are summarized. For the safety issues, liquid/solid electrolytes modification, high-performance separators/interlayers, artificial SEI layers and nanostructured Li anodes of high sulfur loading LSBs are also described. Finally, we conclude with an outlook section to provide some insights on the future prospects of high energy density (over 500 Wh kg(-1)) for LSBs. This discussion and proposed strategies will offer more avenues to the practical application LSBs with high energy density in the future.

Here, we present an ordered meso-microporous core shell carbon (MM(S) as a sulfur container, which combines the advantages of both mesoporous and microporous carbon. With large pore volume and highly ordered porous structure, the "core" promises a sufficient sulfur loading and a high utilization of the active material, while the "shell" containing microporous carbon and smaller sulfur acts as a physical barrier and stabilizes the cycle capability of the entire S/C composite. Such a S/MMCS composite exhibits a capacity as high as 837 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 80% vs the second cycle (a decay of only 0.1% per cycle), demonstrating that the diffusion of the polysulfides into the bulk electrolyte can be greatly reduced. We believe that the tailored highly ordered meso-microporous core shell structured carbon can also be applicable for designing some other electrode materials for energy storage.

However, most reported carbon/sulfur composites exhibiting attractive performance are prepared through complex process, leading to a hard application in industry. Compared with a wide study on cathode material, relative few attentions have been paid on binder which is essential ingredient in cathode and play important role in enhancement of battery performance. Herein, we prepared novel binder (denoted as PAA-DA binder) through reaction of polyamic acid (PAA) and dopamine (DA). There are abundant carbonyl, acylamino, and hydroxide groups in the molecular structure of PAA-DA, which can form a strong interaction with the polysulfide, resulting in the alleviation of shuttle effect. The results of electrochemical test indicate that the PAA-DA binder effectively enhances the cycle stability of cathode at different current densities owning to the functional groups of PAA-DA significantly entrapping polysulfide through chemical interactions.

The membrane offers unique and selective channels which allow only ions/small sulfides to pass through and confine polysulfide transport, restricting the shuttle effect, and thus providing a large capacity of 685 mA h g(-1) at 1C and a long-lasting cycling stability (0.03% capacity decay per cycle). This LSB, which is much superior to the same sulfur-loaded battery without the membrane (0.26% capacity decay per cycle over 207 cycles and 213 mA h g(-1) at 1C), is the best among all reported plain carbonaceous host material-based LSBs. The mechanism responsible for such dramatically improved performance is discussed in detail. This work not only offers a facile approach to greatly improve the capacity and stability of LSBs for practical applications but also offers new scientific insights into LSB design.

However, the poor conductivity and electrochemical reactivity lead to low initial capacity and severe capacity decay. In this communication, a nitrogen and phosphorus codoped carbon (N,P-C) framework derived from phytic acid doped polyaniline hydrogel is designed to support Li2S nanoparticles as a binder-free cathode for Li-S battery. The porous 3D architecture of N and P codoped carbon provides continuous electron pathways and hierarchically porous channels for Li ion transport. Phosphorus doping can also suppress the shuttle effect through strong interaction between sulfur and the carbon framework, resulting in high Coulombic efficiency. Meanwhile, P doping in the carbon framework plays an important role in improving the reaction kinetics, as it may help catalyze the redox reactions of sulfur species to reduce electrochemical polarization, and enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2S. As a result, the Li2S/N, P-C composite electrode delivers a stable capacity of 700 mA h g(-1) with average Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% over 100 cycles at 0.1C and an areal capacity as high as 2 mA h cm(-2) at 0.5C.

In this study, we prepared functional composites based on polypyrrole-coated MnO2 nanotubes as a highly efficient sulfur host (sulfur mass loading 63.5%). The hollow interior of the MnO2 nanotubes not only allowed for accommodation of volumetric changes of sulfur particles during the cycling process, but also confined the diffusion of lithium polysulfides by physical restriction and chemical adsorption, which minimized the loss of polysulfide species. In addition, the polypyrrole outer layer effectively enhanced the electrical conductivity of the cathode to facilitate ion and electron transport. The as-prepared MnO2-PPy-S composite delivered an initial specific capacity of 1469 mA h g(-1) and maintained an extremely stable cycling performance, with a small capacity decay of merely 0.07% per cycle at 0.2C within 500 cycles, a high average coulombic efficiency of 95.7% and an excellent rate capability at 470 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 3C.

These novel GES particles were characterized by XRD, Raman spectrometry, SEM, TGA, EDS and TEM. The electrochemical tests showed that the present GES composites exhibit high specific capacity, good discharge capacity retention and superior rate capability when they were employed as cathodes in rechargeable Li-S cells. A high sulphur content (83.3 wt%) was obtained in the GES composites. Stable discharge capacities of about 900, 650, 540 and 480 mA h g(-1) were achieved at 0.75, 2.0, 3.0 and 6.0 C, respectively. The good electrochemical performance is attributed to the high electrical conductivity of the graphene, the reasonable particle size of sulphur particles, and the core-shell structures that have synergistic effects on facilitating good transport of electrons from the poorly conducting sulphur, preserving fast transport of lithium ions to the encapsulated sulphur particles, and alleviating the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon. The present finding may provide a significant contribution to the enhancement of cathodes for the lithium-sulphur battery technology.

The unique multilevel structure of zero dimensional hollow spheres and two-dimensional overlapping lamellae effectively alleviates the shuttle effect of polysulfides by physical encapsulation. The optimized porous carbon material exhibits a high specific surface area and abundant mesopores and macropores, which is conducive to the dispersion of active materials, rapid transfer of Li+ and improvement of the utilization of elemental sulfur. Moreover, cobalt doping with coordinately unsaturated metal sites can enhance the interaction between the matrix material and polysulfides, further catalyze the conversion reaction of active materials and improve the rate performance of Li-S batteries. Co-SCPC as the cathode matrix material exhibits high initial capacities of 1292.5 and 992.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 1 C, respectively. The remaining capacity is 402.1 mAh g-1 after 1500 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, the battery also shows an outstanding rate performance, with an initial capacity of 416.4 mAh g(-1) and a remaining capacity of 339.7 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at a rate of 5 C.

Here, we proposed a machine learning (ML) method to rapidly and accurately predict the binding energies towards LiPS including Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8 adsorbed on the surface of sulfur hosts with arbitrary configurations and active sites. As a case study, MoSe2 was selected as a sulfur host to predict the binding energy when absorbing the LiPS. The ML method shows six orders of magnitude faster than the conventional density functional theory (DFT), with a low predicted mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.1 eV. Based on the transfer learning (TL), we demonstrated that the presented ML method can be transferred to other layered compounds with a similar AB(2) structure to MoSe2, and can efficiently predict their binding strengths with hosts. WSe2 was employed as a case to validate the TL method, with the results showing that MoSe2 had a stronger binding strength than WSe2 when adsorbing the LiPS, and only one-seventh of the ML training data was required. The impacts of different adsorption sites, configurations and distances on the binding energy were analyzed when LiPS is absorbed, which is of great significance to understand the adsorption mechanism of LiPS with hosts. The proposed work provides an efficient ML method to screen and discover new AB 2 typed two-dimensional layered materials for suppressing the shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur battery.

However, a rapid and scalable fabrication of sulfur/graphene composite with advanced structures and functions is still a big challenge. Here, we report a unique solution-based strategy to simultaneously realize the reduction of graphene oxide (GO), the synthesis of elemental sulfur (S) and the effective packaging of S. In this strategy, the S firstly reacts with hydrazine hydrate and N, N-Dimethylformamide mixture, which generates a reductive sulfur-containing compound. When mixing this reductive sulfur-containing compound with GO dispersion, GO will be reduced and the reductive sulfur-containing compound will be oxidized to generate S. At the same time S will be well encapsulated inside highly wrinkled graphene layers because of the great interaction between graphene and sulfur through this method. Benefited from the unique packaging structures, the sulfur cathode demonstrates superior electrochemical performance in specific capacity, rate capability and cycling stability. A record high specific capacity of 705 mA h/g is realized at 2C even for a thick sulfur cathode with an areal density of 8.1 mg cm(-2). This study brings a facile strategy for the fabrication of advanced sulfur/graphene composites with high energy and power densities. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two different methods, ball mixing and mechanical stirring, were employed for preparation of slurry to obtain morphologically different cathodes. The cathodes prepared with mechanical stirring (SC cathodes) revealed more porous structure than those with ball mixing (BC cathodes). Scanning electron microscopy observations showed that sulfur particles were covered with dense and thick PEO film in the BC cathodes, whereas sulfur particles were bonded with porous PEO film in the SC cathodes. The SC-based cells exhibited much higher discharge capacity yielding 75% of sulfur utilization than the BC-based cells. The difference of discharge behaviors with different mixing methods indicates that the porosity of the cathode and the morphology of PEO binder are highly important factors for favorable electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries. The cycle life of the SC-based cell was improved with the increase of binder content and with the roll pressing due to the increase of adhesiveness and cohesiveness of the sulfur cathode.

The reasonable design for sulfur host materials with catalytic function has been an effective strategy for promoting polysulfide conversion. Compared with other types of transition metal compounds, transition metal borides with high conductivity and catalytic capability are more suitable as sulfur host materials. Herein, a niobium diboride (NbB2) nanoparticle with abundant and high-efficiency catalytic sites has been synthesized by facile solid-phase reaction. The NbB2 with both high conductivity and catalytic nature could regulate 3D-nucleation and growth of Li2S, decrease the reaction energy barrier, and accelerate the transformation of polysulfides. Thus, the NbB2 cathode could retain a high capacity of 1014 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. In addition, the high initial specific capacities of 703/609 mAh g(-1) are also achieved at 5 C/10 C and could run for 1000/1300 cycles within a low decay rate of 0.057%/0.051%. Even with a high sulfur loading up to 16.5 mg cm(-2), an initial areal capacity of 17 mAh cm(-2) could be achieved at 0.1 C. This work demonstrates a successful method for enhancing the kinetics of polysulfide conversion and directing Li2S nucleation.

However, the insulating nature and undesirable shuttle effect still need to be solved to improve the electrochemical performance. Herein, a freestanding graphene supported N-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene@S cathode is successfully synthesized via a straightforward no-slurry method. Due to its unique hierarchical microstructure, the MXene-C/S ternary hybrids with high capacity can effectively adsorb polysulfides and accelerate their conversion. Cooperatively, conductive rGO can ameliorate N-MXene nanosheet' restacking, making the lamellar N-Mxene coated sulfur particles disperse uniformly. The assembled Li-S battery with a freestanding Ti3C2Tx@S/graphene electrode provides an initial capacity of 1342.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and only experiences a low capacity decay rate of 0.067% per cycle after. Even at a relatively high loading amount of 5 mg cm(-2), the battery can still yield a high specific capacity of 684.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, and a capacity retention of 89.3% after 200 cycles.

Different from the majority of reports on porous carbon ensuing large specific surface area (SSA) and total pore volume, it was found that in the case of identically high sulfur content, the pore size distribution substantially influences the performances of Li-S batteries rather than the SSA and total pore volume. Furthermore, in the assembly of micro-/meso-/macropores, the micropore volume ratio to the total pore volume is dominant to the capabilities of batteries. Among the samples, the porous carbon carbonized with the precursor of sucrose at 950 degrees C presents the highest initial discharge specific capacity of 1327 mAh/g and retention of 630 mAh/g over 100 cycles at 0.2C rate along with the best rate capability. This sample possesses the largest micropore volume ratio of 47.54% but a medium SSA of 1217m(2)/g and inferior total pore volume of 0.54 cm(3)/g. The abundant micropores effectively improve the conductivity of dispersed sulfur particles, inhibit the loss of sulfur series and enable the cathode to exhibit superior electrochemical performances.

However, sulfur has poor conductivity, large volume change during charge/discharge, and more importantly, the intermediate polysulfide (Li2Sn, 3 <= n <= 8) produced in the cycling process is easily soluble in the electrolyte resulting in the "shuttle effect", which have greatly limited the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries. Therefore, it is of great value to develop optimized sulfur cathode materials to improve electrode conductivity, buffer volume change and restrain the diffusion of polysulfide. In this work, we construct a V-MOF (MIL-47) derived V2O3@C hollow microcuboid with a hierarchical lasagna-like structure through hydrothermal synthesis followed by calcination, and employ it as a sulfur host for the first time. The fast anchoring of polysulfide by V2O3 nanoparticles and the high electronic conductivity of the 3D carbon framework can simultaneously inhibit the "shuttle effect" in the charge-discharge process and accelerate the kinetics of the redox process. Moreover, the special lasagna-like structure with appropriate voids generated during calcination not only provides many sites for sulfur loading, but also effectively alleviates the volume expansion problem during the electrochemical reaction. Therefore, the final fabricated sulfur cathode via the melt impregnation method exhibits good cycling stability (62.3% after 1000 cycles at 1C) and rate performance (663 mA h g(-1) at 2C) at a relatively high sulfur loading of 3.7 mg cm(-2).

Herein, a dual-functional fibrous skeleton implanted with single-atom Co-N-x\ dispersion is devised as an advanced modificator to realize concurrent regulation of both electrodes. The rational integration of single-atomic Co-N-x sites could convert the fibrous carbon skeleton from lithiophobic to lithiophilic, helping assuage the dendritic formation for the Li anode. Meanwhile, the favorable electrocatalytic activity from the Co-N-x species affording a lightweight feature effectively enables expedited bidirectional conversion kinetics of sulfur electrochemistry, thereby inhibiting the polysulfide shuttle. Moreover, the interconnected porous framework endows the entire skeleton with good mechanical robustness and fast electron/ion transportation. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between atomically dispersed Co-Nx sites and three-dimensional conductive networks, the integrated Li-S full batteries can achieve a reversible areal capacity (>7.0 mAh cm(-2)) at a sulfur loading of 6.9 mg cm(-2). This work might be beneficial to the development of practically viable Li-S batteries harnessing single-atom mediators.

Here, we report that radical polymer Poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) a stable free radical polymer reported to be potential organic electrode materials can perform as a multifunctional sulfur-trapping and catalytic binder for high performance Li-S batteries once activated via in situ electrochemical oxidation. The activated PTMA(+) not only displays strong binding affinity to poly sulfides but also provides PTMA(+)-assisted additional redox sites and improves the kinetics of the cathode reaction. Thus the novel multifunctional additive for Li-S batteries results in improved cycle life, faster rate performance and most importantly, a significantly increase in specific discharge capacity by 80%, with specific capacity of 1254 mAh/g and Coulombic efficiency of 96% at a four-hour charge/discharge (C/4) current rate.

However, DLHC with 20-30 nm interlayer distances between carbon shells were reported due to the difficult controllable synthesis of monodisperse silica template (< 200 nm) in the Stober method, leading to low sulfur utilization. Here, DLHC with the interlayer space up to 50 nm (DLHC-50) is synthesized by controlling hydrolysis rate of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) using ammonia/LiOH as catalysts. DLHC-50 based sulfur cathode contains high sulfur content of 82%, and exhibits excellent cycling and rate performances. This research provides guidance for synthesis of DLHC with high sulfur utilization.

J	Yanilmaz, M; Asiri, AM; Zhang, XW				Yanilmaz, Meltem; Asiri, Abdullah M.; Zhang, Xiangwu			Centrifugally spun porous carbon microfibers as interlayer for Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							GLASS-FIBER SEPARATOR; CYCLE PERFORMANCE; LITHIUM; PAPER; NANOFIBERS; ANODE	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted great interest owing to their high energy density. However, shuttling of polysulfides deteriorates the electro-chemical performance of Li-S batteries and prevents their practical applications. Placing a conductive and porous interlayer structure between the cathode and the separator limits the shuttling effect and improves the cycling performance. Here, porous carbon microfibers are fabricated via a fast, safe and cost-effective centrifugal spinning approach and the resultant centrifugally spun porous carbon microfibers (CS-PCMFs) are evaluated for use as an interlayer in Li-S batteries. The highly porous fibrous structure is observed from SEM and TEM images, and a high initial discharge capacity of 1485 mAh g(-1) is achieved. A high reversible capacity of 615 mAh g(-1) is reached after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. In addition, the cell with CS-PCMF interlayer has low cell resistance of 25 O, whereas that of Li-S cell without interlayer is 55 O. Owing to the low cell resistance, the cell with CS-PCMF interlayer delivers the reversible capacity of around 600 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, while the cell without interlayer exhibits a lower capacity of 250 mAh g(-1). Therefore, this work provides a new approach for designing highly porous carbon microfiber interlayer for Li-S batteries with exceptional electrochemical performance.

The synthesized composites were characterized and examined by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, field emission scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical methods, such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, and rate performance tests. The obtained HCNF@PANI-S composite showed an obvious core-shell structure with a PANI layer coating on the surface of the HCNF, and sulfur homogeneously distributes in the coating layer. The HCNF@PANI-S composite exhibited much better electrochemical performance than the HCNF-S composite, which delivered initial discharge capacity of 960 mAh g(-1) maintained 535 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C rate. The improvements of electrochemical performances may be attributed to the unique hybrid nanostructure of HCNF@PANI and good dispersion of sulfur in the HCNF@PANI-S composite.

However, as for their practical application, the development of solid-state lithium metal batteries is restricted because of the poor Li/electrolyte interface, low Li-ion conductivity, and irregular growth of Li dendrites. To address the above issues, we herein report a high Li-ion conductivity and compatible polymeric interfacial layer by grafting tween-20 on active lithium metal. Sequential oxyethylene groups in tween-grafted Li (TG-Li) improve the ion conductivity and the compatibility of the Li/electrolyte interface, which enables low overpotentials and stable performance over 1000 cycles. Consequently, the poly(ethylene oxide)-based solid-state lithium sulfur battery with TG-Li exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1051.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mA h g(-1)) and excellent stability for 500 cycles at 2 C. The decreasing concentration of the sulfur atom with increasing Ar+ sputtering depth indicates that the polymer interfacial layer works well in suppressing polysulfide reduction to Li2S/Li2S2 on the metallic Li surface even after long-term cycling.

The MgOimpregnated and nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon composite desulfurizers (NMC/MgO), acting as effective catalysts and large storehouses, could catalytically oxidize H2S into elemental S with high catalytic selectivity and sulfur capacity. The obtained byproduct NMC/MgO/S-CO composites possess high sulfur loading (73.8 wt %) and significant structure advantages for practical application in Li-S batteries. First, the uniform distribution of S in the NMC/MgO frameworks via the in situ catalytic oxidation approach could offer large interface area for charge transport and Li+ reaction. Then, the cooperative effects of the "sulfiphilic" MgO nanoparticles and the "lithiophilic" nitrogen dopants in the NMC/MgO could effectively suppress the polysulfide shuttling. Under the further assistance of physical confinement of the mesoporous NMC/MgO, the NMC/MgO/SCO composites present excellent electrochemical performances with a high reversible capacity of 772 mAh g(-1) and a Coulombic efficiency of 93.6% at the 100th cycle at 0.2 C. These encouraging results not only develop a sustainable way to turn waste into wealth but also provide a promising strategy to product high-sulfur-loading cathode materials with uniform distribution of S through the in situ catalytic strategy for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The Co-LDH@rGO microspheres not only maximize the advantages of structure to encapsulate sulfur but also provide excellent conductivity and abundant self-functionalized surfaces to facilitate the adsorption of polysulfides by chemical bonding. Consequently, the obtained Co-LDH@rGO/S electrodes exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performances, such as a high discharge capacity of 1046 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, excellent rate capability, and stable cycle ability at 1 C with a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle over 500 cycles. This work puts forward a simple and effective method to synthesize double-shelled materials, which is helpful for the architectural design of prospective sulfur host materials.

Three-dimensional image based modelling of transport parameters in lithium-sulfur batteries	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; RAY COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; THERMAL RUNAWAY; ELECTRODES; DISCHARGE; TORTUOSITY; OPERANDO; CELLS; EVOLUTION	An elemental sulfur electrode was imaged with X-ray micro and nano computed tomography and segmented into its constituent phases. Morphological parameters including phase fractions and pore and particle size distributions were calculated directly from labelled image data, and flux based simulations were performed to determine the effective molecular diffusivity of the pore phase and electrical conductivity of the conductive carbon and binder phase, D-eff and sigma(eff), that can be used as an input for Li-S battery modelling. In addition to its crucial role in providing electrical conductivity within the sulfur electrode, the intrinsic porosity of the carbon binder domain was found to significantly influence Li-ion transport within the electrode. Neglecting this intrinsic porosity results in an overestimation of the electrical conductivity within the sulfur electrode, and an underestimation of the tortuosity of the Li-ion conducting phase by ca. 56%. The derivation of effective transport parameters directly from image data may aid in the development of more realistic models of Li-S battery systems by reducing the reliance on empirical correlations, and the uncertainties arising from assumptions made in these correlations.

However, the low sulfur utilization, serious "shuttle effect", and large volume expansion of the sulfur cathode restrict the performance of LSBs. Here, CoSe2 decorated hollow N-doped carbon nanotubes (CoSe2/hNCTs) were synthesized firstly, and then the CoSe2/hNCTs were used as a sulfur host to prepare a multifunctional CoSe2/hNCTs/S cathode. DFT calculations confirm that the CoSe2 not only efficiently adsorbs lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also exhibits good catalytic performance for the conversion of LiPSs. SEM and TEM images indicate that the CoSe2 uniformly disperses on the surface of the polypyrrole nanotube-derived hNCTs, like plum blossoms. The hNCTs with a morphology of plum blossom branches provide a high conductive network and prohibit large volume expansion during the electrochemical process. And the plum petal-like CoSe2 on the hNCTs surface acts as a catalyst and an efficient polysulfides trap. The CoSe2/hNCTs/S cathode delivers a satisfactory lithium storage performance, which presents reversible capacities of 1156 and 640 mA h g-1 at 0.5 and 5C, respectively. Simultaneously, the cathode demonstrates excellent cycle stability with a slow capacity decay rate of 0.069% per cycle in 1000 cycles at 1C rate. This work provides a new idea for constructing composites of transition metal selenides and carbon materials, promoting the practical applications of LSBs.

The first discharge specific capacity of the Li-S batteries with the C-10K@2S composite cathode at 0.1C is around 1645 mAh g(-1), which is very close to the theoretical specific capacity of active sulfur. Especially, after 175 cycles at 0.5C, the maintained specific discharge capacities of the C-10K@2S cathode at -20, 0, 25, and 40 degrees C are about 184.9, 687.2, 795.5, and 758.3 mAh g(-1), respectively, and the cathode is superior to most of the classical carbon form matrices. Working mechanisms of the cathodes under different temperatures are confirmed based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Xray diffraction (XRD) characterizations. Distinctively, during the discharge stage, the widely proposed two-step cathodic reactions occur simultaneously rather than sequentially. In addition, the largely accelerated phase conversion efficiency of the cathode at a higher temperature (from room temperature to 40 degrees C) contributes to its enhanced charge/discharge specific capacity, while the byproduct Li2S2O7 or Li3N irreversibly formed during the cycles limits its application performance at 0 degrees C. These conclusions would be very significant and useful for designing cathodes for Li-S batteries with excellent wide working temperature performance.

In terms of environmental protection, the treatment of phytoremediation residues has become a key problem to be solved urgently, while for energy storage, it tends to utilize low-cost and high specific energy storage materials (i.e. porous carbon). In this study, the phytoremediation residues is applied to the storage materials with low-cost and high specific capacity. Firstly, the phosphorous acid assisted pyrolysis of oilseed rape stems from phytoremediation is effective in the removal of Zn, Cu, Cd and Cr from the derived biochar. Moreover, the derived biochar from phytoremediation residues shows abundant porous structure and polar groups (-O/-P/-N), and it can deliver 650 mAh g(-1) with 3.0 mg cm(-2) (sulfur), and keeps 80% capacity after 200 cycles when employing it as a sulfur host for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Hence, phosphorous acid assisted pyrolysis and application in Li-S battery is a promising approach for the disposal of phytoremediation residues, which is contributed to the environmental protection as well as energy storage.

Herein, we designed dual functional, highly ordered, and interconnected mesoporous carbon (MPC) to address the challenges related to the cathode and anode simultaneously. On the anode, a thin layer of MPC annealed at 500 degrees C (MPC-500) was introduced to mechanically suppress Li dendrite growth, which provided interfacial protection on the Li metal and stabilized the Li plating/stripping. This novel anode showed excellent cycling stability at a high current density of 3 mA cm(-2). On the cathode, MPC annealed at 1300 degrees C (MPC-1300) was utilized to confine sulfur. The interconnected mesoporous carbon sphere with a large surface area significantly alleviated the shuttle effect, which contributes to the cycling stability of the Li-S battery. Meanwhile, the conductive carbon promotes electron transfer. When a Li-S full cell was assembled with MPC-500 and MPC-1300 as an anode interface layer and cathode additive, respectively, an exceptional reversible capacity of 607 mA h g(-1) was achieved at a discharge rate of 1 C (1675 mA g(-1)) and maintained at a high capacity retention of 87.5% after 100 cycles.

In this work, a highly graphitized wood framework (GWF) with a porous tunnel structure and microvilli is constructed as a multifunctional interlayer to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The GWF not only retains the 3D transport network of wood, but also offers increased deposition sites for polysulfides through the microvilli which grow on the inner surfaces of the carbon tunnels. Electrochemical tests show that GWF effectively enhances the initial discharge capacity of the Li-S battery to 1593 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C, with a low capacity decline of 0.06% per cycle at 1 C. Besides, the GWF interlayer also effectively protects lithium anodes from corrosion by S-x(2-), thus they still keep their metallic luster and clean surface even after long charge-discharge cycles. These enhancements are attributed to the high conductivity, abundant microvilli, and tunnel confinement effects of GWF, which effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides by the same principle as nose hairs filtering the air. This work presents a new understanding of bionic/biomaterials and a new strategy to improve the performance of Li-S batteries.

Herein, Fe3C/Fe3N@nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) as multifunctional sulfur hosts are designed to realize high-areal-capacity Li-S batteries. The Fe3N and Fe3C particles attached to NCNT can promote the conversion of polysulfides. Besides, NCNT can not only enhance the chemisorption of polysulfides but also increase the special surface area and electrical conductivity by constructing a three-dimensional skeleton network. Integrating the merits of high electrical conductivity, high catalytic activity, and strong chemical binding interaction with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to achieve in situ anchoring conversion, the Fe3C/Fe3N@NCNT multifunctional hosts realize high sulfur mass loading and accelerate redox kinetics. The novel Fe3C/Fe3N@NCNT/S composite cathode exhibits steady cycle ability and a high areal capacity of 9.10 mAh cm(-2) with a sulfur loading of 13.12 mg cm(-2) at 2.20 mA cm(-2) after 50 cycles.

Nano-silicon dioxide was introduced into the active carbon (AC)-hosted sulfur cathode using a melting and diffusion process. The as-prepared cathode materials with different additions of nano-silicon dioxide were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge test. It was found that silicon dioxide addition brings about an improvement of the cathode reaction intensity and an increase in the charge-transfer resistance of the battery.

Enhancement of Li conductivity, identification of a strong adsorption agent for polysulfides and the improvement of the whole sulfur-based electrode are of great technological importance. The diffusion of Li atoms in the outer-wall, inner-wall and inter-wall spaces in nitrogen-doped double-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and penetrations of Li and S atoms through the walls are studied using density functional theory. We find that N-doping does not alter the diffusion behavior of Li atoms throughout the CNTs, but the energy barrier for Li atoms to penetrate the wall is greatly decreased by N-doping (from similar to 9.0 eV to similar to 1.0 eV). On the other hand, the energy barrier for S atoms to penetrate the wall remains very high, which is caused by the formation of chemical bonds between S and nearby N atoms. The results indicate that Li atoms are able to diffuse freely, whereas S atoms can be encapsulated inside the N-doped CNTs, suggesting that the N-doped CNTs can be potentially used in high performance Li-S batteries.

However, low sulfur contents, dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) into the electrolyte and slow conversion kinetics are key challenges for commercialization of sulfided-based LSBs. Herein, massive active sites are fabricated by creating sulfur vacancies on zinc sulfide (ZnS) dispersed on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (ZnS1-x/rGO) and subsequent in situ oxidation-refilling loading strategy, which allows for 90 wt% sulfur contents. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrocatalytical experiments and density functional theory (DFT) confirm that sulfur vacancies act as efficient adsorption and catalytic conversion sites for LiPSs. The S-ZnS1-x/rGO cathode exhibits 1168 mAh g(-1) capacity and similar to 100% Coulombic efficiency with a capacity decay rate of 0.02% per cycle only at 0.5C after 500 cycles, one of the best performance reported up to date. Remarkably, high performances are retained even at 4.5 mg cm(-2) areal sulfur loading.

However, few people have focused on the molecular structure design of the building units of the CTFs to improve the sulfur loading contents and electrochemical performance, whereas the different types, contents of functional groups, and molecular lengths largely dominate the battery's performance. Herein, we purposefully designed and synthesized N, O-containing CTFs (NO-CTF-1 and NO-CTF-2) by the N, O-containing building units for LSB electrodes and explored the influence of heteroatoms (N and O) on the polysulfide redox conversion reactions in detail. N and O heteroatoms with extra pair of electrons in NO-CTFs can interact with the strong Lewis acid of terminal Li atoms in lithium polysulfides. The unique pore structure and the fast heterogeneous nucleation process of Li2S accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfides in a working battery. As a result, NO-CTF-1 delivers a high reversible capacity of 1250 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, an outstanding cycling stability with a capacity retention of 92% at 0.5 C (300 cycles), and an excellent rate performance of up to 678 mA h g(-1) at 2 C. This work provides a new insight into the LSB electrode materials to rationally design the building unit of CTFs and inspires the exploration of the effect of nitrogen, oxygen, and other heteroatoms on the heterogeneous nucleation of Li2S.

The positive sulfur electrode undergoes complex electrochemical reactions, which cause morphological changes of the composite electrode while cycling. In the course to deeper understand the failures of this rather complex, but promising technology, the operando technics are in the heart of the advanced characterizations. In this study, a new electrochemical cell was designed which allows, for the first time, the combination operando of multimodal X-ray characterizations: the absorption tomography to study the morphological evolution of electrodes, and the X-ray diffraction computed tomography to probe locally the structural modification of the crystalline active materials S-8 and Li2S. The combination of these two techniques simultaneously with the electrochemical cycling, allows the production of correlated 3D-maps of quantitative phase distributions and morphology in the electrode, with time resolution on the scale of battery kinetics. It was thus possible to show the heterogeneous behavior in the bulk of the electrode and to propose kinetics law.

ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							COMPOSITE CATHODES; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; HYBRID; DIFFUSION; SURFACE; GROWTH; OXIDE; CHEMISORPTION	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are strongly considered for next-generation energy storage devices. However, severe issues such as the shuttle of polysulfides restrict their practical applications. Exploring the design principle of anchoring poly sulfides physically and chemically through the polar substrate is therefore highly necessary. In this Letter, first-row transition-metal sulfides (TMSs) are selected as the model system to obtain a general principle for the rational design of a sulfur cathode. The strong S binding that is induced by charge transfer between transition-metal atoms in TMS slabs and S atoms in Li2S is confirmed to be of great significance in TMS composite cathodes. An analogous periodic law is proposed, which is also extended to first-row TM oxides. VS has the strongest anchoring effects on Li2S immobilization and a relatively low lithium ion diffusion barrier. The binding energies and Li diffusion properties are considered as the key descriptors for the rational design of sulfur cathodes.

This was accomplished by taking advantage of the pH-responsive multilayers of weak polyelectrolytes such as poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) assembled on the PE separator using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. It was found that the cationic permselectivity (permeability of cation/anion) of an ultrathin multilayer coated separator is highly tunable with respect to the number of bilayers and external pH, benefiting from fine tuning of the internal charge density of the multilayered films. The movement of polysulfide anions was significantly inhibited by five bilayers of PAH/PAA (ca. 98% with multilayers assembled at pH 3/3), while the movement of Li cations was preserved. As a result, the ion-permselective separator demonstrated a high initial reversible capacity of ca. 1418 mA h g(-1) with multilayers assembled at pH 3/3 because of the good permselectivity and the enhanced wetting properties of the LbL treated separator for electrolytes, leading to a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency as compared to a conventional PE separator, i.e., almost 100% over 50 cycles. We anticipate that the permselectivity controllable coating method will be applied for various other membrane technologies.

Two kinds of ligands, terephthalic acid and trimesic acid were used to react with nickel nitrate to obtain Ni-MOF precursors and their carbonized products were named as Ni-C(B) and Ni-C(T) respectively. Ni-MOF precursors with different morphologies were obtained by different ligands, the precursor of Ni-C(B) is the petal-like layered microspheres and the morphology maintained after calcination, the precursor of Ni-C(T) has the structure of drug flake and agglomerates into a massive structure during the reaction. Because of the uniform distribution of nickel particles and the advantages in morphology and specific surface area, the performance of batteries equipped with Ni-C(B) modified separator is better than that of Ni-C(T) sample. Through a series of electrochemical performance tests, the results are consistent with our expectations.

Synthesis procedure is based on a microwave-assisted solvothermal reaction of manganese(III) acetylacetonate with biphenyl-4,4 '-dicarboxylic acid (Bpdc) in N,N '-dimethylformamide at the temperature of 160 degrees C. The obtained Mn-based metal-organic framework, labeled as Mn-Bpdc, was used as a precursor for the preparation of a porous MnO/carbon nanocomposite, which was obtained via thermal transformation in a nitrogen atmosphere at 700 degrees C. It was found that this approach provides an effective and simple preparation pathway for porous carbon decorated with homogeneously embedded manganese(II) oxide nanoparticles. Both Mn-Bpdc and MnO/C nanocomposite materials were characterized by a variety of physicochemical methods. The prepared MnO/C nanocomposite material was deposited on a cathode surface of lithium-sulfur batteries and utilized as a shuttle suppressing layer. This electrode structure immobilizes polysulfides inside the cathode and improves the stability during cycling. The electrode with MnO/C nanocomposite shuttle suppressing layer maintains high stability during cycling in comparison with a standard electrode. The electrode with MnO/C composite layer exhibits 84.8% capacity retention after 50 cycles at different C-rates compared to 76.2% obtained for the standard electrode.

Large clusters of CNTs anchored on the inner walls of 3D graphene networks act as capillaries, benefitting restriction of agglomeration by high contents of immersed S. Moreover, the capillary-like CNT clusters grown in situ in the pores efficiently form restricted spaces for Li polysulfides, significantly reducing the shuttling effect and promoting S utilization throughout the charge/discharge process. With an areal S mass loading of 81.6 wt.%, the 3DG-CNT/S electrode exhibits an initial specific capacity reaching 1,229 mA.h.g(-1) at 0.5 C and capacity decays of 0.044% and 0.059% per cycle at 0.5 and 1 C, respectively, over 500 cycles. The electrode material also reveals a remarkable rate performance and the large capacity of 812 mA.h.g(-1) at 3 C.

In this work, a composite of reduced graphene oxide and beta-phase TiO2 nanoparticles (RGO/TiO2(B)) is designed as a separator modification material for improving the electrochemical behavior of Li-S batteries. The TiO2(B) nanoparticles are in situ prepared and tightly adhere to the RGO layer. A series of examinations demonstrated that the RGO/TiO2(B)-coated separator efficiently inhibits the polysulfide shuttling phenomenon by the cooperative effect of physical adsorption and chemical binding. Specifically, as modified separators, a comparison between TiO2(B) and anatase TiO2(A) each composited with RGO has been conducted. The TiO2(B) sample not only exhibits a superior blocking character of migrating polysulfides, but also enhances battery electrochemical kinetics by fast Li ion diffusion.

At the sulfur loading of 2.5 mg/cm(2), initial specific capacity of 1021.8 mAh/g at 1C was achieved in the Li-S cell with the Ce-MOF-2/CNT coated separator, which was slowly reduced to 838.8 mAh/g after 800 cycles with a decay rate of only 0.022% and the Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. Even at a higher sulfur loading of 6 mg/cm(2), the cell based on Ce-MOF-2/CNT separator coating still exhibited excellent performance with initial specific capacity of 993.5 mAh/g at 0.1 C. After 200 cycles, the specific capacity of 886.4 mAh/g was still retained. The excellent performance is ascribed to the efficient adsorption of the Ce-MOF-2 to Li2S6 species and its catalytic effect toward conversion of polysulfides, resulting in suppressed shuttle effect of polysulfides in the Li-S batteries.

The unique CNT-GC@NC integrates the advantages of carbons derived from both ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 with features of hierarchically meso/microporous structure, high Co nanoparticle and N heteroatom contents and graphitic structures. It is verified that the grafting of CNTs onto the outer surface of carbon polyhedrons can form interconnected conductive networks with the highly graphitic carbon within. The embedded Co nanoparticles and doped nitrogen can synergistically promote the adsorption of sulfur species and thus the redox reaction kinetics of polysulfides. On the other hand, the nitrogen-doped and micropores-enriched NC shell acts as a physical barrier to totally enclose polysulfides within the carbon hosts. Thanks to these advantages, the CNT-GC@NC/S presents excellent rate performance and cycling stability with the high reversible capacities of 700 and 580 mAh g(-1) at 200th and 800th cycle at 1 C, respectively.

After several initial conditioning charge/discharge cycles, this unique TiNi/C/S hybrid nanocomposite cathode shows a high capacity (300 mAh/g based on total and 960 mAh/g based on 5) with Coulombic efficiency of near 100% at 100 mA/g for around 300 cycles without obvious capacity decay. Due to its high electronic/ionic conductivity, the TiNi/C/S nanocomposite can retain an overall capacity of 150 mAh/g (480 mAh/g based on 5) even at a higher current density of 10.0 A/g, demonstrating the outstanding rate capability. The exceptional performance of TiNi/C/S cathode can be ascribed to (i) the strong interactions between nano-TiNi and S to form metal disulfide clusters, (ii) the CB percolating throughout the composite to prevent nano-TiNi and metal sulfides particles from aggregating into large particles during lithiation/delithiation, (iii) the good electronic conductivity of TiNi and CB to facilitate transportation of electrons, and (iv) the flexibility of CB and TiNi alloy to accommodate large volumetric change during lithiation/delithiation. These synergistic interactions among TiNi, C and S provide a new material design strategy to achieve high overall performance of S cathodes for Li-S batteries.

The present study details the development of ecofriendly and low-cost carbon material containing fluorine (F) atoms prepared from biomass Ipomoea carnea flower (IC). The favourably developed carbon material is used as electrode for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), supercapacitors and biomedical application of the same is explored. Owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, high energy density and low production cost, LSBs are recognised as propitious class of energy storage devices. The detriments like fast capacity fading arising due to insulating nature, shuttle effect and volume expansion of sulfur electrode is surmount by employing ternary composite of sulfur/silicon dioxide/IC (SSIC) as cathode for LSBs. The outcome of this work reveals that polysulfides are confined both physically and chemically by highly electronegative F atoms present in IC along with SiO2, thereby alleviating shuttle effect and demonstrates better electrochemical performance. SIC electrode exhibited a coulombic efficiency of 95%, whereas SSIC electrode delivered efficiency of 99.5% after entire cycling life. Here, IC carbon matrix is also employed as electrode material for supercapacitor device which delivered specific capacitance up to 382 F g(-1) which is outstanding when compared to capacitances from other reported carbon supercapacitors. The cytotoxicity of IC carbon is analysed by co-culturing IC carbon with human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 cell line). The cell death is observed in the IC50 concentration of 56.23 mu g/ mL.

Their power densities, however, are today considerably worse than that of the LIBs, limiting the Li-S batteries to very few specific applications that need low power and long working time. With the rapid development of single cell components (cathode, anode, or electrolyte) in the last few years, it is expected that an integrated approach can maximize the power density without compromising the energy density in a Li-S full cell. Here, this goal is achieved by using a novel biomass porous carbon matrix (PCM) in the anode, as well as N-Co9S8 nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the cathode. The authors' approach unlocks the potential of the electrodes and enables the Li-S full pouch cells with unprecedented power densities and energy densities (325 Wh kg(-1) and 1412 W kg(-1), respectively). This work addresses the problem of low power densities in the current Li-S technology, thus making the Li-S batteries a strong candidate in more application scenarios.

We have investigated how speciation of S in Li/S cathodes changes upon the introduction of CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CH3(CH2)(15)N+(CH3)(3)Br-) and with charge/discharge cycling. The introduction of CTAB changes the synthesis reaction pathway dramatically due to the interaction of CTAB with the terminal S atoms of the polysulfide ions in the Na2Sx solution. For the cycled Li/S cell, the loss of electrochemically active sulfur and the accumulation of a compact blocking insulating layer of unexpected sulfur reaction products on the cathode surface during the charge/discharge processes make the capacity decay. A modified coin cell and a vacuum-compatible three-electrode electro-chemical cell have been introduced for further in-situ/in-operando studies.

High Area Capacity Lithium-Sulfur Full-cell Battery with Prelitiathed Silicon Nanowire-Carbon Anodes for Long Cycling Stability	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; LI-S BATTERIES; HIGH SPECIFIC ENERGY; ION BATTERIES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; IN-SITU; DENDRITE FORMATION; POWDER; MECHANISM; PRELITHIATION	We show full Li/S cells with the use of balanced and high capacity electrodes to address high power electro-mobile applications. The anode is made of an assembly comprising of silicon nanowires as active material densely and conformally grown on a 3D carbon mesh as a light-weight current collector, offering extremely high areal capacity for reversible Li storage of up to 9 mAh/cm(2). The dense growth is guaranteed by a versatile Au precursor developed for homogenous Au layer deposition on 3D substrates. In contrast to metallic Li, the presented system exhibits superior characteristics as an anode in Li/S batteries such as safe operation, long cycle life and easy handling. These anodes are combined with high area density S/C composite cathodes into a Li/S full-cell with an ether- and lithium triflatebased electrolyte for high ionic conductivity. The result is a highly cyclable full-cell with an areal capacity of 2.3 mAh/cm(2), a cyclability surpassing 450 cycles and capacity retention of 80% after 150 cycles (capacity loss <0.4% per cycle). A detailed physical and electrochemical investigation of the SiNW Li/S full-cell including in-operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements reveals that the lower degradation is due to a lower self-reduction of polysulfides after continuous charging/discharging.

These conversion chemistry cathodes have been typically prepared by using conventional slurry-based techniques widely used for Li ion battery electrodes, requiring the use of solvent and binder and multiple steps such as mixing, casting, drying, and collecting and proper disposing of organic solvents. To increase active material mass loading, the processing steps become even more time-consuming when multiple casting-drying cycles are needed. Here we report an extremely facile procedure to prepare ultrahigh mass loading (>15 mg/cm2) with high active material content (>70%) conversion chemistry cathodes in a single step directly from neat active material, such as sulfur (S), selenium (Se), or selenium sulfide (SeS2), without the need of solvent or binder. This is achieved by the use of holey graphene (hG), a unique lightweight material that can be dry pressed by itself or as a host into neat or composite electrode forms. In the electrode preparation, hG, the neat active material, and hG are sequentially added to the pressing die, resulting in a sandwich architecture containing a neat active material layer with conveniently tunable ultrahigh mass loading. The sandwich electrodes exhibit excellent overall electrochemical performance with great active material utilization. Mechanistically, when Se is used as the example active material, the neat Se layer becomes electrochemically redistributed throughout the entire cathode thickness after the first cycle. The sandwich cathode not only does not crack or fail but also spontaneously densifies for stable and prolonged cycling. The sandwich electrode architecture is also compatible with the use of a fluorinated electrolyte solvent to significantly reduce polyselenide solubility and shuttling for improved cycling performance. Such sandwich electrodes from the hG-enabled, one-step, dry-press method offer an attractive fast fabrication option in bulk production of ultrahigh mass loading cathodes for practical applications.

The cell with this cathode exhibits an ultrahigh cycling stability and rate capability. After activation, a capacity of 749.5 mAh/g was obtained on the 54(th) cycle at a discharge current of 3.2 A/g. After 500 cycles, capacity of 561.8 mAh/g remained (74.96% retention), with only a very small average capacity decay of 0.056%. The excellent reversibility and stability of the novel sulfur cathode can be attributed to the ability of the boron-doped microporous carbon host to both physically confine polysulfides and chemically bind these species on the host surface. Theoretical calculations confirm that boron-doped carbon is capable of significantly stronger interactions with the polysulfide species than undoped carbon, most likely as a result of the lower electronegativity of boron. We believe that this doping strategy can be extended to other metal-air batteries and fuel cells, and that it has promising potential for many different applications.

The well-developed mesopores in the OMCs provide an excellent ion transport path, enhancing mass transport capability and thus demonstrating better cycling performance and rate capability. Particularly, platelet OMC (pOMC) with thin hexagonal prism shape and short mesopore length demonstrates the high reversible discharge capacity of 1419 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 168 mA g(-1) and excellent cyclability. Based on the specific capacity, cycle efficiency, and rate capability, the pOMC-S outperforms considerably its mesoporous carbon peers, rod-like OMC-S (rOMC-S) and spherical OMC-S (sOMC-S) with longer mesopore length. This superb behavior is attributed to better and more utilization of short mesopore channels for active sulfur species, which induce higher sulfur utilization, and are also supported by low electrochemical resistances in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The improved cell performance can be understood in terms of utilization efficiency of the mesopore channels for sulfur loading and polysulfide dissolution, which improves with decreasing channel length.

However, its commercialization is still restricted owing to the low conductivity of sulfur, large volume expansion, and a severe polysulfide shuttle effect. To address these problems, here, we have reported for the first time a simple template-free solvothermal method combined with a subsequent calcination method to prepare cobalt-doped vanadium nitride (VN) yolk-shell nanospheres, encapsulated in a thin layer of a nitrogen doped carbon (Co-VN@C) composite as an ideal sulfur host. Benefiting from the unique structural advantages and the synergistic effect of conductive VN, cobalt, and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC), the obtained composite could not only facilitate the kinetics of polysulfide conversion as a functional catalyst but also physically confine and chemically absorb the polysulfides effectively. With these advantages, the batteries present a high initial discharge capacity of 1379.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C is defined as 1675 mA g(-1)) good rate performance, and excellent cycling performances (similar to 715 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 200 cycles and similar to 600 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 300 cycles, respectively), even with a high areal sulfur loading of 4.07 mg cm(-2) (similar to 830 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles). These results demonstrate that the rationally designed multifunctional sulfur host material Co-VN@C has great potential for application in Li-S batteries.

Infrared spectroscopy and microscopy studies indicate that the composite consists of RGO decorated by SPAN particles of 100 nm average size. The SPAN/RGO composite shows good overall electrochemical performance when used in Li-S batteries. It exhibits similar to 85% retention of the initial reversible capacity of 1467 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles at a constant current rate of 0.1C and retains 1100 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. In addition, the composite displays excellent Coulombic efficiency and rate capability, delivering up to 828 mAh g(-1) reversible capacity at 2C. The improved performance stems from the composition and structure of the composite, wherein RGO renders a robust electron transport framework and PAN matrix help suppresses the shuttle effect by absorbing sulfur/polysulfides.

Herein, a N, S-codoped micro-mesoporous carbon was synthesized from boat-fruited sterculia seed, and used as a sulfur host matrix for Li-S batteries. After sulfur infiltration (approximate to 62% sulfur) and cell assembly, the obtained S/NSBC cathode shows outstanding discharge-charge performance, good rate capability, and especially long cycling stability. A high initial discharge capacity of 1478 mA h g(-1) was achieved at 0.1C, and the reversible discharge capacity was still retained at 649 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C with ultralow decay rate of 0.08% per cycle, and especially zero-capacity-decay after 300 cycles. Such superior electrochemical performance of S/NSBC cathode is attributed to the synergy of the unique 3D conductive micro-mesoporous frameworks and huge N, S-codoped polar surface within the carbon matrix, which can physically confine the dissolved polysulfides within the pore structures, and chemically anchor the polysulfides through chemical interaction between lithium polysulfides and N and S sites, thus enabling the favorable reaction kinetics, efficient utilization of sulfur, and effective mitigation of polysulfide diffusion and shuttling within the cathode. This work well manifests the great feasibility and superiority of utilizing bioresources for high performance Li-S batteries.

Along with a light weight, this 3D current collector allowed us to accommodate a higher amount of sulfur composite, which led to a remarkable increase of the electrode capacity from 200 to 500 mAh per 1 g of the electrode including the mass of the current collector. Varying the electrospinning solution concentration enabled obtaining carbonized nanofibers of uniform structure and controllable diameter from several hundred nanometers to several micrometers. The electrochemical performance of the cathode deposited on carbonized PAN nanofibers at 800 degrees C was investigated. An initial specific capacity of 1620 mAh g(-1) was achieved with a carbonized PAN nanofiber (cPAN) current collector. It exhibited stable cycling over 100 cycles maintaining a reversible capacity of 1104 mAh g(-1) at the 100th cycle, while the same composite on the Al foil delivered only 872 mAh g(-1). At the same time, 3D structured CNFs with a highly developed surface have a very low areal density of 0.85 mg cm(-2) (thickness of -25 mu m), which is lower for almost ten times than the commercial Al current collector with the same thickness (7.33 mg cm(-2)).

In spite of efforts to overcome these issues, separate research in the anode and cathode fields could not tackle the problems of both electrodes simultaneously, limiting the realization of LSB. Herein, a bifunctional separator is fabricated by coating morphology-controlled NbN on a Celgard separator. The large surface area (67 m(2) g(-1)) and strong adsorptive surface of NbN effectively suppress the crossover of soluble intermediates to the anode side, and the captured sulfur species can be reactivated on the electrical conductive NbN surface to enhance the capacity. Most importantly, the improved mechanical strength and electrolyte wettability of separator by NbN functional layer suppress the growth of Li dendrite in anode. Consequently, even with sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2), the capacity decay per cycle reaches only 0.061% during 300 cycles at 1 C rate.

Herein, novel TiH2 nanodots (THNDs) fabricated by sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation are used as bifunctional electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal that THNDs can not only provide a strong chemical affinity to polysulfides but also bidirectionally promote the precipitation/decomposition of Li2S from/to polysulfides during the discharge/charge process, thus effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the redox kinetics of polysulfides. Owing to these advantages accompanied by the abundant catalytically active sites of THNDs, the assembled Li-S batteries deliver a low capacity fading rate of 0.055% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1C and a high areal capacity of 5.38 mAh cm(-2) after 50 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 8.5 mg cm(-2). This work demonstrates the great potential of utilizing functional metal hydrides as effective electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries, which will incite more investigation into the specific selection of metal compounds to boost the redox kinetics of polysulfides.

Herein, the authors report a new nitrogen and oxygen in situ dual-doped nonporous carbonaceous material (NONPCM) that is composed of a myriad of graphene-analogous particles. Importantly, NONPCM could be fabricated on a kilogram scale via inexpensive and green hydrothermal-carbonization-combined methods. Many active sites on the NONPCM surface are accessible for the efficient surface-chemistry confinement of guest sulfur and its discharge product; this confinement is exclusive of physical entrapment, considering the low surface area. Electrochemical examination demonstrates excellent cycle stability and rate performance of the NONPCM (K)/S composite, even with a sulfur loading of 80 or 90 wt%. Hence, the scaffolds for LSBs exhibit potential for industrialization through further optimization and expansion of the present synthesis.

In this hybrid structure, the alpha-Fe2O3 nano-particles are proved to not only strongly interact with the polysulfides, but more importantly, chemically promote their transformation to insoluble species during the charge/discharge process, working as chemical barriers for the shuttling of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Therefore, together with 3D hierarchical porous structure facilitating fast electron/ion transfer, Fe-PGM as a sulfur host in a cathode contributes to a high rate performance (565 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 5 C relative to 1571 mAh g(-1) at 0.3 C) as well as long cyclic stability (an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.049% per cycle over 1000 cycles at the high current rate of 5 C).

The sulfur/RANEY (R) nickel (S/RN) composite is prepared via an accessible solvent method. The key feature of RANEY (R) nickel is that it contains poriferous channels, which act as barriers against the loss of active materials due to physical and chemical adsorption during discharge/charge cycling. The chemical adsorption of RANEY (R) nickel for sulfur, verified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), leads to the generation of Ni-S chemical bonds. In addition, RANEY (R) nickel, possessing excellent conductivity, can improve the reaction kinetics of an electrode with a high rate capability. As a result, the S/RN cathode presents an initial discharge capacity of 1469 mA h g(-1), achieving a minimal capacity fade of 0.12% per cycle after 500 cycles at the rate of 0.5C with an excellent coulombic efficiency of around 99%. Furthermore, the S/RN cathode is promising for use in compact batteries due to its high volumetric specific capacity.

Although the LiPSs loss and conversion are ameliorated by physical and chemical methods with the design of multi-functional host material structures, the problem of capacity attenuation has not been fundamentally solved. Seeking for reliable polar hosts with suitable adsorption capacity and good catalytic ability for the conversion process is still an issue with great challenge. Herein, a high-efficiency nitrogen doped carbon supported FeSe electrocatalyst derived from the carbon skeleton (FeSe@NC) is used as the sulfur host for Li-S batteries. During the discharge process, Fe-S and LiSe bonds would be formed in pairs, thus forming a double bond effect to alleviate the shuttle effect. In particular, the FeSe@NC with good conductivity and double bond effect can catalytically accelerate capture/diffusion of polysulfides and improve the utilization of active substances from Li2S2 to Li2S in solid-to-solid conversion. Thus, the FeSe@NC/S cathode exhibits an excellent capacity of 1087 mAh g-1 at 1C and 441 mAh g-1 at 5C. This work will inspire the optimization design of adsorption-electrocatalysis engineering of transition-metal-based composite materials for diverse applications.

To this end, host materials with high conductivity and excellent polysulfide absorbability are extensively employed as the loading scaffolds for sulfur in LSBs. In the present study, three types of borophene nanosheets with metallicity are theoretically evaluated as the hosts for sulfur cathodes. The polarization of surfaces, conductivity, polysulfide immobilization, and the interfacial competition between borophenes and electrolytes are particularly discussed. The strong binding of polysulfides onto borophenes will block the shuttle effect of polysulfides, due to the strong Coulomb interactions between the B and S atoms, even considering the competitive effect of the electrolytes and under a high sulfur loading. The calculated results clearly indicate that borophene-based materials with polarized and highly conductive surfaces hold great promise for LSBs.

Herein, first-principles calculations are conducted to verify that the introduction of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 not only enhances polysulfide adsorption but also greatly improves the catalytic ability and both the ion and electron conductivities. A commercial polypropylene (PP) separator decorated with TiO2 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies (OVs-TiO2@PP) is fabricated as a strong polysulfide barrier for the Li-S battery. The thickness of the OVs-TiO2 modification layer is only 500 nm with a low areal mass of around 0.12 mg cm(-2), which enhances the fast lithium-ion penetration and the high energy density of the whole cell. As a result, the cell with the OVs-TiO2@PP separator exhibits a stable electrochemical behavior at 2.0 C over 500 cycles, even under a high sulfur loading of 7.1 mg cm(-2), and an areal capacity of 5.83 mAh cm(-2) remains after 100 cycles. The proposed strategy of engineering oxygen vacancies is expected to have wide applications in Li-S batteries.

Herein, we utilized mesoporous N-doped graphene (NGM) as a sulfur host, which was synthesized using a type of triblock copolymer, Pluronic F127 (PF127), as a soft template. PF127 not only acted as a spacer to prevent the graphene layers from restacking during the hydrothermal reaction, but also resulted in the formation of high-density wrinkles on the surface of the graphene sheets after annealing. The crumpled NGM with a nitrogen doping content of 4.80 at% had the high specific area and total pore volume of up to 958.72 m(2) g(-1) and 2.39 cm(3) g(-1), respectively, providing space for the accommodation and uniform distribution of sulfur in the cathode. Therefore, the sulfur content was increased to 87.2 wt% in the graphene sulfur composite, achieving the discharge capacity of 492.2 mA h g(TE)(-1) at 1.08 A g(TE)(-1) with a low capacity decay rate of 0.12% per cycle after 400 cycles. Thus, this study provides an effective strategy for enhancing the specific surface area and pore volume of graphene to develop Li-S batteries with high performance.

Herein, we report a straightforward and sustainable method to fabricate lightweight and resilient graphene/cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC) aerogel (GCA) monoliths. Mimicking the vein-like texture of nature, the resulting materials with oriented nanofibers and porous can rapidly recover from compression (up to 95% strain). Inspired by the nanofiber alignment, we assemble 0D sulfur nanoparticles (S-NPs) into 3D GCA matrix as a sulfur immobilizer for electrode material design. Accordingly, a high reversible discharge capacity (1048mAh/g at 0.5C) with a low capacity fading (0.06% per cycle) are achieved when the S-NPs/GCA is used as the cathode of Li-S batteries (LSBs). These features undoubtedly could enable the graphene/nanofiber elastomers to play a vital role in the future attractive applications of wearable devices and electronic skins. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

However, their commercial applications are greatly hindered by rapid capacity decay due to poor conductivity of electrode, fast dissolution of the intermediate polysulfides into the electrolyte, and the volume expansion of sulfur. Herein, we report a novel composite MWCNTs@TiO2-S nanostructure by grafting TiO2 onto the surface of MWCNTs, followed by incorporating sulfur into the composite. The inner MWCNTs improved the mechanical strength and conductivity of the electrode and the outer TiO2 provided the adsorption sites to immobilize polysulfides due to bonding interaction between TiO2 and polysulfides. The MWCNTs@TiO2-S composite with a mass ratio of 50% (MWCNTs in MWCNTs@ TiO2) exhibited the highest electrochemistry performance among all compositing ratios of MWCNTs/TiO2. The performance improvement might be attributed to the downward shift of the apparent Fermi level to a more positive potential and electron rich space region at the interface of MWCNTs-TiO2 that facilitates the reduction of lithium polysulfide at a higher potential. Such a novel hybrid structure can be applicable for electrode design in other energy storage applications.

The RGO/S/PANI composite possessed 809.3/801.9 mAh g(-1) of initial charge/discharge capacities, higher than 588.3/588.2 mAh g(-1) for reduced graphene oxide/sulfur (referred to RGO/S) and 681.4/669.9 mAh g(-1) for sulfur/polyaniline (referred to S/PANI) at similar conditions. The RGO/S/PANI composite obtained 400 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and good reversible capacities of 605.5 and 600.8 mAh g(-1) at 100th charge/discharge cycle at 0.1 C, in comparison with low electrochemical performance of RGO/S and S/PANI. The improved properties could be attributed to the collaboration of RGO and PANI. Co-generation of RGO and sulfur acted as seeds for their depositions, stimulated their uniform distributions, and restricted the agglomeration of sulfur particles in situ synthesis. Polyaniline coated RGO/S and stabilized the nanostructure of RGO/S/PANI in repeated charge/discharge cycles. In addition, RGO and PANI provided many electron channels to enhance sulfur conductivity and sufficient void space for sulfur swelling during charge/discharge cycles.

However, the complicated synthesis process may hinder their practical applications. Their mechanical and electrochemical properties shall be further improved. Herein, a facile scalable dip-coating process is developed to synthesize a flexible composite cathode with a high sulfur loading. Via the process, a hybrid composed of carbon nanotubes, carbon black, sulfur, and titania nanoparticles is successfully conformally coated on the carbonized textile (c-textile). The formed flexible c-textile@S/TiO2 cathodes with sulfur loadings of 1.5 and 3.0 mg cm(-2) can deliver reversible discharge capacities of 860 and 659 mA h g(-1) at 2 C, respectively. For the latter one, it can retain 94% of the initial capacity after 400 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency (similar to 96%). When its sulfur loading is further increased to 7.0 mg cm(-2), its areal capacity reaches 5.2 mA h cm(-2). Such excellent performance is ascribed to the synergy effect of the three-dimension conductive hierarchical pore structure and TiO2 additive. They can physically and chemically entrap the soluble polysulfides in the composite cathode. The as-synthesized free-standing composite electrode is of low cost and a high areal capacity, making it applications based on Li-S batteries.

A simple layer-by-layer procedure is used to construct a sandwiched vein-membrane interlayer of thickness 2 mu m and areal density 0.104 mg cm(-2) by loading MnO2 nanoparticles and graphene oxide (GO) sheets on superaligned carbon nanotube films. The G/M@CNT interlayer provides a physical shield against both polysulfide shuttling and chemical adsorption of polysulfides by MnO2 nanoparticles and GO sheets. The synergetic effect of the G/M@CNT interlayer enables the production of Li-S cells with high sulfur loadings (60-80 wt%), a low capacity decay rate (-0.029% per cycle over 2500 cycles at 1 C), high rate performance (747 mA h g(-1) at a charge rate of 10 C), and a low self-discharge rate with high capacity retention (93.0% after 20 d rest). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and scanning electron microscopy observations of the Li anodes after cycling confirm the polysulfide-trapping ability of the G/M@CNT interlayer and show its potential in developing high-performance Li-S batteries.

As a first measure to counteract these issues, a new and simple sulfur-loading method consisting of solution impregnation and subsequent melt-diffusion (IM) is demonstrated and compared to the conventional method of physical mixing followed by melt-diffusion (PM). Using the IM method, sulfur is well encapsulated and highly dispersed in conducting mesoporous carbons (MCs) that possess an ideal pore diameter (around 10 nm) and a large pore volume (similar to 2.8 cm(3) g(-1)). S/MC cathodes prepared by the IM method deliver much higher capacities, better rate responses and cycling stabilities up to 300 cycles (the fading rate was as low as -0.037% per cycle) with less concerns in lithium polysulfide (LPS) shuttling and impedance build up than S/MC cathodes prepared by the PM method. The S/MC cathodes prepared by the IM method has a pseudo-optimum sulfur content of 65 wt%, and when coupled with a new type of carbon-coated separator (CCS), a high areal capacity of >2.5 mA h cm(-2) is successfully achieved, combined with excellent cycling stability and rate capability.

The authors demonstrate here multichannel carbon nanofibers that are composed of parallel mesoporous channels connected with micropores as sulfur containment. In addition, hydroxyl functional groups are formed on the carbon surface through a chemical activation to enhance the interaction between sulfur and carbon. In the sulfur embedded composite, the mesoporous multichannel enhances the active material utilization and sulfur loading, while the micropores act as a reaction chamber for sulfur component and trap site for polysulfide with the assistance of the functional groups. This sulfur-carbon composite electrode with 2.2 mg cm(-2) sulfur displays excellent performance with high rate capability (initial capacity of 1351 mA h g(-1) at C/5 rate and 847 mA h g(-1) at 5C rate), maintaining 920 mA h g(-1) even after 300 cycles (a decay of 0.07% per cycle). Furthermore, a stable reversible capacity of as high as approximate to 1100 mA h g(-1) is realized with a higher sulfur loading of 4.6 mg cm(-2).

However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and the "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) severely limit their battery performances. To overcome the complex and multiphase sulfur redox chemistry of LiPSs, in this study, we propose a new type of cobalt-based double catalytic sites (DCSs) codoped mesoporous carbon to immobilize and reversibly catalyze the LiPS intermediates in the cycling process, thus eliminating the shuttle effect and improving the charge-discharge kinetics. The theoretical calculation shows that the well-designed DCS configuration endows LiPSs with both strong and weak binding capabilities, which will facilitate the synergistic and reversible catalytic conversion. Furthermore, the experimental results also confirm that the DCS structure shows significantly enhanced catalytic kinetics than the single catalytic sites. The Li-S battery equipped with the DCS structure displays an extremely high discharge capacity of 918 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 C and can reach a capacity of 867 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles with an ultralow capacity attenuation rate of 0.028% for each cycle. This study opens new avenues to address the catalytic requirements both in discharging and charging processes.

However, their practical application is still seriously hindered by the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the Li-S batteries system. Introducing anchoring materials into the cathode or separator, which can strongly attract LiPSs because of advisable binding energies, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to alleviate the shuttling effect for achieving the excellent cycling performance of Li-S batteries. In this work, the complete mechanistic understanding of the interaction between non-metallic monolayer materials (N-MMLMs, including Graphene, BN, C2N and C3N4) and LiPSs is given in detail with the aid of density functional theory. The calculation results show that N-MMLM can combine the chemical interaction and the physical entrapment of sulfur species to suppress the shuttling effect. C3N4 and C2N are predicted to trap LiPSs via stronger interfacial interaction and alleviate the interactions between LiPSs and solvents as well as the consequent dissolution. The strong anchoring effect of C3N4/C2N comes from the bonding of Li-N/C-S and charge transfer. Further charge transfer study reveals that the C3N4/C2N can serve as an electrocatalyst, which effectively accelerates the kinetics of LiPSs redox reactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, sulfur, loaded by melting-diffusion method, is usually attached to the outside surface of carbon host, resulting in weak adsorption to expose polysulfide. Herein, we report a template-free method for synthesizing graphene-like nano-cell (GLC) with high in situ sulfur loading (S@GLC). The GLC is expected to provide physical adsorption by enclosed graphene cell architecture and chemical adsorption by pyridinic N-doping and oxygen functional group. With these merits, the S@GLC cathode owned high sulfur content (72%) and also, it exhibited a reversible specific capacity of 1253 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, excellent rate performance, and long cycling stability (502 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 1C).

However, developing high-efficiency hollow hosts for improving utilization and conversion of aggregated sulfur in the hollow chamber remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, hollow N-doped carbon nanocubes confined petal-like ZnS/SnS2 heterostructures (ZnS/SnS2@NC) as a conceptually novel host for Li-S batteries are reported. Specifically, compared to consubstantial hollow double-shelled hosts, the ZnS/SnS2@NC with higher effective active surface area brings dense contact with sulfur and enhances efficient adsorption sites for binding LiPSs and accelerating their conversion. Benefiting from the unique structure and sophisticated composition, the resulting S@ZnS/SnS2@NC cathodes exhibit 1294 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, an ultralow capacity decay of 0.016% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1.0 C, and a high area capacity of 4.77 mAh cm(-2) at 0.5 C (5.9 mg cm(-2)). Meanwhile, the performance evolution of S@ZnS/SnS2@NC cathodes under various sulfur loadings is further investigated by using EIS, which provides the beneficial guidance to explore viable strategies further optimizing their performance. This work sheds new insights into the design of hollow nanostructured hosts with a distinguished ability to regulate LiPSs in Li-S batteries.

Hydrothermally reduced graphene oxide for the effective wrapping of sulfur particles showing long term stability as electrodes for Li-S batteries	CARBON			English	Article							CATHODE MATERIALS; CARBON NANOSHEETS; LITHIUM; GRAPHITE; COMPOSITES; CAPACITY; NITROGEN; SHEETS	Lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S) are identified as one of the most promising rechargeable energy systems due to their high theoretical capacity, high gravimetric energy density, low cost and low environmental impact. However, the insulating nature of sulfur and the migration of soluble polysulfides during discharge limit their practical application. In an attempt to mitigate these drawbacks here we report the preparation of a novel composite formed by hydrothermally reduced graphene oxide (HrGO) and submicrometer-sized sulfur particles. The role of HrGO is not restricted to enhance the electronic conductivity of the composite, but also sulfur wrapping in order to prevent polysulfides migration. Besides, the addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) during the synthesis of the sulfur particles allows a greater control of their size and improves its homogeneous distribution within the composite. The material is tested as cathode for Li-S batteries showing reversible capacities over 900 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.2 C and more than 650 mAh g(-1) after 100 charge-discharge cycles. Moreover, this simplistic and environmentally friendly approach allow obtaining composites with sulfur loadings as high as 92 wt%, and large areal capacities up to 1.5 mAh cm(-2).

However, currently, several prohibitive challenges occur within the sulfur core, especially the polysulfide-diffusion problem. To address these scientific issues, we present here a boron-doped multiwalled carbon nanotube coated separator (B-CNT-coated separator). The B-CNT-coated separator creates a polysulfide trap between the pure sulfur cathode and the polymeric separator as a "polysulfide-trapping interface," stabilizing the active material and allowing the dissolved polysulfides to activate the bulk sulfur cores. Therefore, the dissolved polysulfides change from causing fast capacity fade to assisting with the activation of bulk sulfur clusters in pure sulfur cathodes. Moreover, the heteroatom-doped polysulfide-trapping interface is currently one of the missing pieces of carbon-coated separators, which might inspire further studies in its effect and battery chemistry. Li-S cells employing B-CNT-coated separators (i) exhibit improved cyclability at various cycling rates from 0.2C to 1.0C rate and (ii) attain a high capacity retention rate of 60% with a low capacity fade rate of 0.04% cycle(-1) after 500 cycles. We believe that our B-CNT-coated separator could light up a new research area for integrating heteroatom-doped carbon into the flexible, lightweight, carbon-coated separator.

Now, amorphous N-doped carbon/MoS3 (NC/MoS3) nanoboxes with hollow porous architectures have been meticulously designed as an advanced sulfur host. Benefiting from the enhanced conductivity by the N-doped carbon, reduced shuttle effect by the strong chemical interaction between unsaturated Mo and lithium polysulfides, improved redox reaction kinetics by the catalytic effect of MoS3, great tolerance of volume variation and high sulfur loading arising from flexible amorphous materials with hollow-porous structures, the amorphous NC/MoS3 nanoboxes enabled sulfur electrodes to deliver a high areal capacity with superior rate capacity and decent cycling stability. The synthetic strategy can be generalized to fabricate other amorphous metal sulfide nanoboxes.

J	Rafie, A; Singh, A; Kalra, V				Rafie, Ayda; Singh, Arvinder; Kalra, Vibha			Synergistic effect of sulfur-rich copolymer/S-8 and carbon host porosity in Li-S batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Carbon nanofibers; Sulfur-rich copolymers; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Porosity; Polysulfide shuttle	INVERSE-VULCANIZATION; ELEMENTAL SULFUR; CATHODE MATERIALS; LITHIUM; SURFACE; POLYSULFIDES; DIFFUSION; POLYMERS	In this work, we investigate the possible role of host material porosity in performance of Li-S batteries, when sulfur-rich copolymer is used as an active ingredient in the cathode. We synthesized a freestanding cathode material using electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and poly(sulfur-random-1,3-diisopropenylbenzene)/SDIB (with some residual unreacted sulfur) and used it without adding any binders or current collectors. To study the effect of porosity of CNFs, two different porous samples, microporous (miCNF) and mesoporous (meCNF), were designed. When miCNF was used as a host material, the capacity stabilized to 577 mAh/g within 50 cycles and remained stable up to 600 cycles with a small capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle along with an excellent coulombic efficiency of > 98% throughout the 600 cycles. On the other hand, SDIB-meCNF cathodes delivered a stable capacity of -600 mAh/g with negligible decay. However, the stability only lasted for 145 cycles. Despite the positive effect of C-S bond formed in SDIB active material, we hypothesize that the porosity of the cathode host still plays a significant role not only due to residual unreacted S 8 in the original cathode, but also due to additional loose soluble -Snchains that emerge from S-S bond breakage in C-S-S-n-S-C (SDIB) over the course of cycling. Moreover, using the effective capacity calculation, we compared the discharge capacity of our cathode to other works on sulfur rich copolymers at C/2 and C/5 rates. The effective capacity analysis clearly manifests the advantages of using current-collector and binder-free electrospun CNFs as a host matrix for SDIB. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, the electrochemical rate and cycling performance are significantly enhanced by the design of polar hierarchical-porous carbon container to confine sulfur species. The as-fabricated carbon container shows the following merits: providing an affordable pore volume of 4.94 cm(3) g(-1) for confining sulfur and releasing volume changes; facilitating rapid electron/ion transfer pathway; allowing efficient chemisorption of polysulfides by polar active sites synergistically. As a result, the cathode displays a high rate capacity of 581 mA h g(-1) at 8 C and a stable cyclability at 2 C. Importantly, the cathode with 7.2 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading presents a high areal capacity of 9.75 mA h cm(-2) at 0.05 C and high rate performance. Up to 7.5 mg cm(-2), the high loading cathode could still display a high areal capacity of 5 mA h cm(-2) at 1 C after 80 cycles. Moreover, the container can successfully work in a pouch cell with low E/S ratio. These results show a promising way to promote the practical utilization of Li-S batteries.

The synthesis is very flexible to control the pore structure and nitrogen doping of the carbons by changing the initial composition of the precursors. The structural similarity of these materials allow them to serve as model systems for mesoporous carbons in-general, to comparatively illustrate the enhanced supercapacitor and Li-S cathode properties by nitrogen doping and micropore development. It is found that additional microporosity prevails over the nitrogen doping on the electrostatic adsorption for supercapacitor, while nitrogen doping performs better on the trapping polysulfide species especially at high current rates for Li-S cathode. Simultaneous creation of microporosity and nitrogen doping into mesoporous carbons could combine the synergistic effects, thus greatly improving the electrochemical properties both for supercapacitors and Li-S cathode.

The morphology and elemental composition of TiO2 were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS). The CNTs/S cathodes with TiO2/CNTs composite coated separator deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1051. 1 mA.h/g and still retain a capacity of 904. 8 mA.h/g after 150 cycles at 0.5C. Even at 1C, the capacity is still up to 1036. 9 mA.h/g, and a high capacity of 763.0 mA.h/g is retained after 250 cycles, showing good rate performance.

Here, we report a feasible strategy to effectively suppress polysulfide and selectively control ions transport applying a new-type ultralight aerofilm membrane for practical Li-S batteries. Catalytic hybrid aerofilm interlayer (HAI) consisting of sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene and manganese dioxide nanowires suffices physical shield and sieve polysulfides through sulphophilicity polymer within the gaps of manganese dioxide layers, while also imparting chemical anchoring and catalysis of Mn-O. Such co-operative synergetic effects of the hybrid aerofilm interlayer for the Li-S cells enable the realization of a high discharge capacity of 1189 mAh g(-1) at the end of the 500th cycle with a capacity retention of over 92.3 %, which is a 671 % improvement over sulfur battery with NO interlayer. Moreover, the aerofilm interlayer provides Li-dendritic growth inhibition and self-discharge prevention to retain the cycle life and safety of the device. This study presents a forward-looking strategy for developing an ultralight-compact and high-power Li-S battery.

To address these stumbling blocks, we designed gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) nanorods decoration of ketjen black@sulfur (Gd2O3/KB@S) composite that adsorbs and provides sufficient sites with lithium polysulfides interaction. The Gd2O3 nanorods play a key role in the adsorption and catalysis performance of polysulfides, which further accelerate the redox kinetics. Consequently, the Gd2O3/LB@S cathode with sulfur loading of 3.1 mg cm(-2) attained a high initial discharge capacity of 817.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C with a decaying rate of 0.097% per cycle over 500 cycles. Even with high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2), the Gd2O3/KB@S cathode also presents a capacity of 5.1 mAh at 0.2 C with retention of 73% over 160 cycles. The strategy proposed here would advance the development of continuous rare earth oxides in the field of rechargeable batteries.

However, it is still a challenge to develop Li2S cathodes with low electrochemical overpotential, high capacity and reversibility, and good rate performance. This work designs and fabricates a practical Li2S cathode composed of Li2S/few-walled carbon nanotubes@ reduced graphene oxide nanobundle forest (Li2S/FWNTs@ rGO NBF). Hierarchical nanostructures are obtained by annealing the Li(2)SO4/ FWNTs@ GO NBF, which is prepared by a facile and scalable solution-based self-assembly method. Systematic characterizations reveal that in this unique NBF nanostructure, FWNTs act as axial shafts to direct the structure, Li2S serves as the internal active material, and GO sheets provide an external coating to minimize the direct contact of Li2S with the electrolyte. When used as a cathode, the Li2S/FWNTs@ rGO NBF achieve a high capacity of 868 mAh g(-1) (Li2S) at 0.2C after 300 cycles and an outstanding rate performance of 433 mAh g(-1) (Li2S) even at 10C, suggesting that this Li2S cathode is a promising candidate for ultrafast charge/discharge applications. The design and synthetic strategies outlined here can be readily applied to the processing of other novel functional materials to obtain a much wider range of applications.

All solid sulfur electrically isolated from the cathode is electrochemically reduced to polysulfides during the first discharge. Notably, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) studies have demonstrated that the S in the separator disappears completely even when the cell is discharged to 2.1 V in the first cycle. The combination of a SIS with a typical S cathode results in the doubling of the areal capacity with superior cycling stability upon comparison with the control cell. This result demonstrates that the introduction of additional active materials, such as elemental sulfur, to a separator is a highly effective method for the fabrication of Li-S cells with a high areal capacity.

In addition, the low mass loading/utilization of sulfur is another key factor that makes Li-S batteries difficult to commercialize. Here, a porous catalytic V2O3/V8C7@carbon composite derived from MIL-47 (V) featuring heterostructures is reported to be an efficient polysulfide regulator in Li-S batteries, achieving a substantial increase in sulfur loading while still effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and enhancing kinetics. Systematic mechanism analyses suggest that the LiPSs strongly adsorbed on the V2O3 surface can be rapidly transferred to the V8C7 surface through the built-in interface for subsequent reversible conversion by an efficient catalytic effect, realizing enhanced regulation of LiPSs from capture to conversion. In addition, the porous structure provides sufficient sulfur storage space, enabling the heterostructures to exert full efficacy with a high sulfur loading. Thus, this S-V2O3/V8C7@carbon@graphene cathode exhibits prominent rate performance (587.6 mAh g(-1) at 5 C) and a long lifespan (1000 cycles, 0.017% decay per cycle). It can still deliver superior electrochemical performance even with a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm(-2). These heterostructures can be further applied in pouch cells and produce stable output at different folding angles (0-180 degrees). More crucially, the cells could retain 4.3 mAh cm(-2) even after 150 cycles, which is higher than that of commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This strategy for solving the shuttle effect under high sulfur loading provides a promising solution for the further development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

Lithium-sulfur batteries, with a high theoretical specific energy, are promising candidates for next generation energy storage. However, the use of Li metal in Li-S batteries compromises both safety and performance, enabling dendrite formation and causing fast capacity degradation. Previous studies have probed alternative battery systems to replace the metallic Li in Li-S system, such as a Si/Li2S couple, with limited success in performance. Recently, there is a focus on red P as a favorable anode material to host Li. Here, we establish a novel battery scheme by utilizing a P/C nanocomposite anode and pairing it with a Li2S coated carbon nanofiber cathode. We find that red P anode can be compatible in ether-based electrolyte systems and can be successfully coupled to a Li2S cathode. Our proof of concept full-cell displays remarkable specific capacity, rate and cycling performances. We expect our work will provide a useful alternative system and valuable insight in the quest for next generation energy storage devices.

Herein, a unique hierarchical porous N-doped carbon nanofiber architecture with in-situ generated iron carbide nanocatalysts (Fe3C@PCNFs) is delicately designed by using natural collagen fibers as the precursor matrix and the structure-directing agent, which can be applied as an advanced sulfur host in LSBs. Benefiting from the thermal-induced etching by ferric species combined with ZrO2 hard-template management, such transformed Fe3C@PCNFs framework exhibits enhanced graphitization degree, impressive hierarchical porous architecture, and high specific surface area near 1300 m(2) g(-1). The in-situ embedded polar Fe3C nanoparticles are proved to possess excellent chemical adsorption and catalysis effect toward the immobilization-conversion of polysulfides and fast Li2S nucleation. Thus, a target cathode (SeFe3C@PCNFs) with >76 wt% sulfur content can deliver outstanding rate capability (632 mAh g(-1) at 5C) and superb cycling performance (similar to 0.067% capacity decay per cycle over 500 cycles). Impressively, when applied with high-areal-loading of 6.3 mg cm(-2), the SeFe3C@PCNFs still exhibits a stable cycling life together with a significant high areal capacity of 5.0 mAh cm(-2), manifesting a promising application in practical LSBs.

Abundant micropores, mesopores, and different spatial structures exist inside the two carbon materials. They demonstrate good conductivity and sulfur storage capacity, and various rich pore structures, inhibiting the shuttle effect of the solved lithium polysulfide in the charge-discharge process. The pore size distribution, pore volume, specific surface area, electronic conductivity, composite structure, interaction between sulfur and carbon, and cell performance are researched. The Li-S battery furnished with the two carbon-sulfur hybrid materials as the cathode host material delivers a well reversible rate cycling performance, and a low decay rate of 0.037% and 0.056% per cycle during 1000 cycles at 1C for FLC and OLC, respectively, with a sulfur load of about 2.2 mg/cm(2). The excellent electrochemical performance of the two carbon materials obtained by detonation method makes them ideal substitute products of the commercial Super P carbon material, especially the FLC material.

Herein, we developed a method to overcome these two obstacles synchronously by designing nitrogenous carbon decorated hollow Co3-xMnxO4/C nanocages as hosts of sulfur. These hosts were derived from manganese doped ZIF-67 by a facile sintering method, which provided polar surface to anchor lithium polysulfides and considerable electronic conductivity. The polar material Co(3-x)Mn(x)O(4)and special hollow frame contribute to efficient synergistic sulfur-fixation, resulting in great cycling stabilities. The manganese elements ensure an efficient conversion among LSPs. At the same time, N-doped carbon provides excellent electrical conductivity, thereby leading to splendid rate performances. Thus, a battery with great stability and high capacity could be achieved. As a result, Co3-xMnxO4/C/S with 66 wt% sulfur content delivered a high initial capacity of 1082 mA h g(-1)at 1C, together with a slow average capacity decay of 0.056% per cycle at 10C over 500 cycles. When the average sulfur loading is 1.3 mg cm(-2), a capacity of 628 mA h g(-1)can be maintained at 5C after 500 cycles.

A carbon felt networked with microfibers consisting of pores, 2 nm and smaller, is used as a freestanding sulfur host. Three different methods of sulfur infiltration are explored in order to determine the best one to fill most of the pores. It was identified to be a melt infiltration method in a vacuum oven, where the pores including the ultra-micropores, are successfully filled. In-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show a solid product formation occurring at the sulfur cathode, both during the high voltage plateau and at the end of discharge. In a 3-electrode EIS measurement, a similar solid product formation on the Li counter electrode due to its reaction with polysulfides is also observed. Operando small angle neutron scattering measurements show the solid product formation, in the carbon, both near the beginning and at the end of discharge, confirming the precipitation data via contrast changes as a function of charge and discharge. It is shown that Li2S precipitates in the pores at the beginning and the end of discharge, whereas S-8 precipitates on the surface of the carbon felt. This lithium sulfur system shows both the quasi-solidstate and the solid-liquid-solid reactions in a typical ethereal electrolyte solution with a two-plateau discharge profile.

However, the wide application of Li-S batteries has been severely impeded due to the poor electrical conductivity of S, shuttling effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and sluggish redox kinetics of S species, especially under high S loading. To address all these issues, a Ni-CeO2 heterostructure-doped carbon nanofiber (Ni-CeO2-CNF) is developed as an S host that combines the strong adsorption with the high catalytic activity and the good electrical conductivity, where the LiPSs anchored on the heterostructure surface can directly gain electrons from the current collector and realize a fast conversion between S-8 and Li2S. Therefore, Li-S batteries with S@Ni-CeO2-CNF cathodes exhibit superior long-term cycling stability, with a capacity decay of 0.046% per cycle over 1000 cycles, even at 2 C. Noteworthy, under a sulfur loading up to 6 mg cm(-2), a high reversible areal capacity of 5.3 mAh cm(-2) can be achieved after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. The heterostructure-modified S cathode effectively reconciles the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of LiPSs for adsorption and conversion, furthering the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

First-principles calculations show that the (111) surface of CoSe2 possesses adjacent nucleophilic and electrophilic centers. This bi-polar surface can easily bond the polysulfide molecules and catalyze their conversion reactions. As a result, the decomposition energy barriers of polysulfides are greatly decreased from ~3.0 eV to 0.2-0.4 eV. Following theoretical prediction, CoSe2 nanocrystals with specific (111) surface are prepared and embedded in porous carbon nanocages using ZIF-67 metal organic framework as a template. Benefited from the advantages of porous C and CoSe2 (111) surface, the shuttling of polysulfides is suppressed and their conversion kinetics is facilitated. The Li-S cell using this host material exhibits high capacity and remarkable cycle stability, showing a discharge capacity of 1199 mA center dot h center dot gxe213; 1 at 0.2C and 400 stable cycles at 1.0C.

The electrochemical analysis on the upper-plateau discharge capacity (Q(H)) and the lower-plateau discharge capacity (Q(L)) is introduced for assessing, respectively, the polysulfide retention and the electrochemical reactivity of the cell. The analysis results in line with the expected materials chemistry principles suggest that the interlayer configuration offers stable cell performance for sulfur cathodes. The significance of the interlayer is to block the free migration of the dissolved polysulfides, which is a key factor for immobilizing and continuously utilizing the active material in sulfur cathodes. Accordingly, the carbon mat interlayers provide sulfur cathodes with a high discharge capacity of 864 mA h g(-1) at 1 C rate with a high capacity retention rate of 61% after 400 cycles.

However, traditional thick electrodes often lead to sluggish ion transfer kinetics as well as decreased electronic conductivity and mechanical stability, leading to their thickness-dependent electrochemical performance. Here, free-standing and low-tortuosity N, O co-doped wood-like carbon frameworks decorated with carbon nanotubes forest (WLC-CNTs) are synthesized and used as host for enabling scalable high-performance Li-sulfur batteries. EIS-symmetric cell examinations demonstrate that the ionic resistance and charge-transfer resistance per unit electro-active surface area of S@WLC-CNTs do not change with the variation of thickness, allowing the thickness-independent electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. With a thickness of up to 1200 mu m and sulfur loading of 52.4mgcm(-2), the electrode displays a capacity of 692 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C with a low E/S ratio of 6. Moreover, the WLC-CNTs framework can also be used as a host for lithium to suppress dendrite growth. With these specific lithiophilic and sulfiphilic features, Li-S full cells were assembled and exhibited long cycling stability. Improving the energy density of lithium-sulfur batteries is necessary for their practical application. Here, the authors report free-standing and low-tortuosity carbon frameworks as host for sulfur and lithium, enabling scalable thickness independent electrochemical performance.

However, some challenging obstacles such as uncontrolled dendrites of Li metal anode and polysulfides shuttling in the sulfur cathode substantially impede the practical application. In this work, we propose a versatile strategy of fabricating graphene nanoscroll (GNS) based bifunctional Janus polypropylene (Janus PP) separators for inhibiting lithium dendrites and suppressing polysulfides shuttling toward high-performance Li-S batteries. On the anode side of the separator, nitrogen-doped GNS (NGNS) were used to protect the lithium metal. The highly uniform NGNS nanostructure facilitated electrolyte penetration and homogenous Li+ flux, thus fundamentally prompting lithiation/delithiation kinetics and inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. Due to these properties, the Li symmetrical cell with NGNS-modified PP separator (NGNS-PP) delivers an ultralow voltage hysteresis of 36 mV at 6.0 mA cm(-2) after 12 000 h (65.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) after 3400 h). On the cathode side, GNS-wrapped Co3O4 nanoparticles (Co3O4@GNS) used as an interlayer on the PP separator, acting as a wonderful physical blocking and chemical catalytic layer to sufficiently mitigate the "shuttle effects" of lithium polysulfides. As a result, with the Janus PP separator, Li-S cells obtained a stable capacity of 805 mA h g(-1) after 800 cycles (a capacity decay of 0.018% per cycle at 1.0C). Therefore, this proposed strategy of GNS-based Janus separators will pave a new way to rationally construct durable and efficient Li-S batteries.

During spray drying, sucrose melts and embeds Li2SO4 when Li2SO4 were sprayed out with graphene oxide and sucrose, and becomes sphere particles. The as-prepared Li2S composite was received after a heat treatment under nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray diffraction patterns confirm the cubic structure of Li2S and scanning electron microscope images reveal that Li2S and carbon components stay in sphere structure with diameter around 20m. The sphere Li2S composite shows enhanced performance when acts as cathode. Under current density of 100mAg(-1), a specific discharge capacity of 778mAhg(-1) has been achieved and the battery cycled over 60 rounds. Furtherly, the sphere composite was coupled with silicon/graphite anode to construct full cell system, suggesting large possibility to work with the current lithium-ion battery anodes.

J	Li, B; Xie, M; Yi, GH; Zhang, CM				Li, Bing; Xie, Meng; Yi, Guanghai; Zhang, Cunman			Biomass-derived activated carbon/sulfur composites as cathode electrodes for Li-S batteries by reducing the oxygen content	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; SURFACE-AREA; CARBON; PERFORMANCE	Corncob-derived activated carbon/sulfur as the cathode electrode for lithium sulfur batteries shows a good electrochemical performance, but the capacity fades rapidly with increase of cycle time. The experimental results demonstrate that such capacity fading is closely related to oxygen content of the activated carbon matrix. To investigate the effect of oxygen content on capacity fading, four carbon matrices (CAC, OAC, HAC, NAC) with different oxygen contents but similar surface areas and pore textures were obtained through a two-step method, namely, CAC was firstly oxygenated by nitric acid and then was reduced by H-2 or NH3 at high temperature. The oxygen content of CAC, OAC, HAC and NAC was about 9.49 wt%, 20.41 wt%, 4.98 wt% and 4.74 wt%, respectively. Electrodes HAC/50S (H-2-treated carbon/sulfur composite with 50% sulfur) and NAC/50S with low oxygen content show a big improvement compared to the CAC/50S electrode. The HAC/50S and NAC/50S electrode deliver a high initial discharge of 1443 and 1504 mA h g(-1) respectively, which remain at 756 and 799 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.3C, demonstrating a good cycle capacity and stability. It is believed that the carbon matrix with low oxygen content can effectively trap the lithium polysulfides within the carbon framework, weakening the shuttle effect and thus slowing down the capacity fade to a certain degree. Therefore, one of the effective routes to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries is to reduce the oxygen content.

At the front face, the conductive functionalized carbon fiber paper (f-CFP) having oxygen-containing groups i.e., -OH and -COOH on its surface was placed face to face with the sulfur cathode serving as the first barrier accommodating the volume expansion during cycling process and the oxygen-containing groups can also adsorb the soluble LPSs via lithium bonds. At the back face, a crystalline coordination network of [Zn(H2PO4)(2)(TzH)(2)](n) (ZnPTz) was coated on the back side of f-CFP serving as the second barrier retarding the left LPSs passing through the front face via both physical confinement and chemical adsorption (i.e. Li bonding). The LSB using the Janus-like interlayer exhibits a high reversible discharge capacity of 1,416 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C with a low capacity fading of 0.05% per cycle, 92% capacity retention after 200 cycles and ca. 100% coulombic efficiency. The fully charged LSB cell can practically supply electricity to a spinning motor with a nominal voltage of 3.0V for 28 min demonstrating many potential applications.

To proof this concept, we prepared a Li+-insertable microporous carbon-sulfur composite by vaporizing sulfur into the micropores of the nanofiber-wired carbon microspheres. The experimental results demonstrate that, in the carbonate electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6/PC-EC-DEC, such S/C composite electrode exhibits not only stable cycling performance with a reversible capacity of 720 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, but also superior high coulombic efficiency of similar to 100% upon extended cycling (except the first three cycles). The structural and electrochemical analysis indicates that the improved electrochemical behaviors of the S/C composite arise from a new reaction mechanism, in which Li+ ions and electrons transport through the carbon matrix into the interior of the cathode and then react with the embedded sulfur in the S/C solid-solid interfaces, avoiding the solution of the intermediates into the bulk electrolyte. More significantly, the structural design and working mechanism of such a sulfur cathode could be extended to a variety of poorly conductive and easily soluble redox-active materials for battery applications.

The linear S-n clusters can be anchored strongly to the AM-CNT for the favorable size of n=5 and the maximum size of n=6 in the production of the cathode, which depresses the mass loss of active sulfur effectively and eliminates the formation of high-order polysulfides completely during the discharge process. The most stable 3 D cross-linked Inter-S-5-AM-CNT network shows a fast electron transfer redox reaction through the CNT skeleton that possesses a theoretical capacity of 1337 mA h g(-1) (based on sulfur) or 592 mA h g(-1) (based on the cathode). The discharge products of the linear S-5 cluster tend to form a hyperbranched tight structure through N...S...Li bridges that are fully impregnated in the AM-CNT bundles, and thus stabilize the entire system. Importantly, this study provides vital guidance into how to design cathodes based on small sulfur clusters for Li-S batteries to depress the shuttle effect intrinsically during charge-discharge cycles, which can be extended to the other small-sulfur-cluster-based batteries.

Despite main advantages, lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries still suffer from great challenges with serious capacity decay and awful rate performance due to severe "shuttle effect" and mass loss of active materials. Herein we report a free-standing carbon-sulfur cathodes by anchoring sulfur into 3D carbon nanorods arrays. Binder-free and integrated characteristics are realized. Sulfur infuses into interspaces among arrays and trapped by the interconnected carbon arrays. The assembled cells exhibit initial discharge specific capacity of 1050 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and 892 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C, companied by an outstanding coulombic efficiency of 98% after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. The obtained S-C cathode also shows excellent rate capacity with low capacity fade. The proposed new S-C architecture may pave the way toward construction of novel S-Li batteries.

However, further advances have been hindered by various intractable challenges, particularly three notorious problems: the "shuttle effect", sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfide conversion, and nonuniform nucleation of Li2S. In this study, a three-in-one cathode host based on a superlattice of two-dimensional (2D) materials is designed to tackle these three issues. Alternately restacked Nb3O8 nanosheets with Lewis acid surface and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with high electrical conductivity give rise to a unique superlattice structure without the self-restacking, thereby maximizing the synergistic effect that stems from the inherent advantages of each component. The Nb3O8/rGO superlattice cathode host is characterized by its high affinity, excellent catalytic activity, abundance of exposed active sites, and high electrical conductivity, effectively confining lithium polysulfides and reducing the overpotentials for lithium polysulfide conversion and Li2S nucleation. As a result, high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries were achieved with an initial capacity of 1529 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and a slow capacity decay of 0.064% per cycle at 1C over 1000 cycles. This work provides a novel strategy of heteroassembling 2D nanosheets as a cathode host, opening a promising avenue for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries.

Sulfur was incorporated in these carbons via a simple chemical deposition method in aqueous solutions and the resulting composites were tested as electrodes in Li-S cells. The electrochemical results showed that well-ordered mesoporous carbons perform better than those with a random mesopore arrangement (wormhole-like mesoporous structure). The mesopore ordering yields a framework of well-connected empty sites that results in an enhancement of both the charge carrier mobility and the reversibility of the electrochemical reaction. Although the activation with CO2 partially destroys the mesopore arrangement, which adversely affects the electrode performance, it notably increases the surface area and the micropore content which improves the connectivity between the mesopores. The final observation was an irrelevant effect of the activation process at low current densities. However, at higher rates the activated carbon composite delivered higher capacities. The hierarchical pore structure formed by micro- and mesopores should guarantee the required fast mobility of the Li+.

Scotch-tape-like sulfur-assisted exfoliation of graphite is developed to produce the graphene-sulfur composites and freestanding low-defect graphene sheets. The intimate interaction between sulfur and graphene, attributed to the similar electronegativities of the two elements, is stronger than the van der Waals forces between adjacent p-p stacked graphene layers. This causes cleavage of the graphene layers when the sulfur molecules stick to the surface and edges of the graphite, similar to Scotch tape in micromechanical exfoliation processes. This approach enables us to obtain graphene with an electrical conductivity as high as 1820 S cm(-1) and a Hall mobility as high as 200 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), superior to most reported graphene. Furthermore, the graphene sheets which uniformly anchor sulfur molecules provide a superior confinement ability for polysulfides, sufficient space to accommodate sulfur volumetric expansion, a large contact area with the sulfur and a short transport pathway for both electrons and Li+. The unique structure containing 73 wt.% sulfur exhibits excellent overall electrochemical properties of 615 mA h g(-1) at the 1 C (1 C 1675 mA g(-1)) rate after 100 cycles (corresponding average Coulombic efficiency of over 96%) and 570 mA h g (-1) at 2 C. These encouraging results represent that sulfur molecules bound onto graphene sheets could be a promising cathode material for lithium batteries with a high energy density.

The currently explored Li-S cathode designs often deploy systems with liquid electrolyte infiltration, hence with relatively low volumetric capacity. In the current study, we theoretically test a compact solid three-dimensional (3D) design (more like a Li-ion battery cathode than a conventional Li-S cathode) consisted of a sandwich structure alternating between the two-dimensional (2D) Mn-hexaaminobenzene-based coordination polymer (2D Mn-HAB-CP) layer and the amorphous Li-S layer. We study the theoretical limits for both its gravimetric and volumetric energy capacity, as well as its structural stability and Li diffusion within the cathode system. To study the Li diffusion within an amorphous system, we also develop a pull-atom molecular dynamics (PA-MD) to calculate the barrier heights of such disordered systems. We reveal the mechanism that determines the Li diffusion in the amorphous layer of the system. Overall, we find such a 3D solid Li-S cathode can be practical, with sufficient large gravimetric and volumetric energy capacity, as well as the Li diffusion constant. It also solves many other common Li-S cathode problems, from Li polysulfide dissolution to electrical insulating, and structure instabilities.

Porous carbon materials had proven themselves to be an ideal immobilizer host for S impregnation. Herein, carbon aerogels (CAs) with tunable pore microstructure were synthesized from resorcinol-formaldehyde reaction with increasing catalyst concentration and pyrolysis under high temperature. The results demonstrated that the catalyst concentration played a key role in tuning the porous microstructure of the CAs. In addition, potassium hydroxide (KOH) was introduced to activate the obtained CAs. The activated carbon aerogels (A-CAs) with hierarchical porous structure exhibited the highest specific surface area (1837.4 m(2) g(-1)) and the largest total pore volume (2.276 cm(3) g(-1)), which combined the advantages of both mesoporous and microporous. The effects of porous microstructure, specific surface area, and pore volume of the CAs and A-CAs on S incorporation were studied. The S/A-CAs exhibited significantly improved reversible capacity (1260 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.1 C), enhanced high-rate property, and excellent cycling performance (229 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C) as a cathode for Li-S batteries.

Results and DTF simulation confirmed that the strong electrochemical interaction of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) with TNTAs supported by a carbon-coated separator (CCS), suppressed the shuttling effect significantly. The presence of TNTA resulted in stable cycling and superior rate performance by offering a specific discharge capacity of 1050 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5 C with a low capacity-decay rate of 0.075% per cycle. The cathode with the loading of 6.8 mg S cm(-2) delivered a discharge capacity of 729 mA h g(-1), corresponding to 4.95 mA cm(-2) after 100 cycles at the rate of 0.2 C. The outperformance of the cell equipped with TNTAs became more attractive when the cathode with the loading of 3 mg S cm(-2) has been fabricated with the simple blade-casting method using sulfur powder. The sulfur cathode delivered a superior discharge capacity of 905 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles with Coulombic efficiency > 97%. The results have demonstrated that the coexistence of TNTAs, CCS and sulfur cathode in the pure phase offers an efficient strategy to achieve a high-energy density for sustainable sulfur-based energy storage systems.

However, practical Li-S batteries with high energy densities are extremely hindered by the sulfur loss, low Coulombic efficiency, and short cycling life originating from the polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle. In this study, two-dimensional (2D) ZnCo2O4 microsheets fabricated by a facile hydrothermal process are employed to modify the separator, for improving the electrochemical performances of Li-S cells. The resulting 2D ZnCo2O4-coated separator features a coating thickness of approximately 10 mu m, high ionic conductivity of 1.8 mS/cm, and low mass loading of 0.2 mg/cm(2). This 2D ZnCo2O4-coated separator effectively inhibits LiPS shuttle by a strong chemical interaction with LiPS as well as promotes the redox kinetics by ZnCO2O4-coated layers, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, self-discharge, time-dependent permeation test, Li symmetric cell test, and Li2S nucleation analyses. Consequently, the Li-S batteries based on the 2D ZnCo2O4-coated separator exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 1292.2 mAh/g at 0.1 C. Moreover, they exhibit excellent long cycle stability at 1 and 2 C with capacity retention of 84% and 86% even after 800 cycles, corresponding to a capacity fading rate of 0.020% and 0.016% per cycle, respectively. Effectively, these Li-S cells with a high sulfur loading at 5.3 mg/cm(2) and low electrolyte concentration of 9 mu L/mg deliver a high discharge capacity of 4.99 mAh/cm(2) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C.

Here, we introduce high-energy-density Li-S batteries with excellent performance for storing pulsed output from TENGs. The sandwich-structured sulfur composites with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and polypyrrole serve as cathode materials that suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides and thus preserve the structural stability of the cathode during Li-ion insertion and extraction. The charging time and energy storage efficiency of the Li-S batteries are directly affected by the rotation rates of the TENGs. The average storage efficiency of the batteries for pulsed output from TENGs can exceed 80% and even reach 93% at low discharge currents. The Li-S batteries also show excellent rate performance for storing pulsed energy at a high discharge current rate of 5C. The high storage efficiency and excellent rate capability and cyclability demonstrate the feasibility of storing and exploiting pulsed energy provided by TENGs and the potential of Li-S batteries with high energy storage efficiency for storing pulsed energy harvested by TENGs.

However, they still do not have practical implementations because of issues induced by intermediate polysulfide dissolution. To better confine both S and polysulfides in cathode regions and prolong the cyclic lifespan, we purposely design the unique highly puffed Co9S8/carbon nanofibers (Co(9)S(8)pCNFs) as efficient S carriers. Such fibrous products made of interconnected hollow/porous Co9S8/C nanopolyhedra can provide ample places to load the large amount of S, convenient pathways for both Li+ and electrons transfer, and extra reversible capacity contribution. Particularly, each individual Co9S8 subunit is physically robust, metallic, and polarized, synergistically enabling the spatial confinement and chemical bonding to restrict S volume expansions and anchor the soluble polysulfides during cycling. The as-built highly puffed S subset of Co9S8@CNFs cathodes can exhibit a large specific capacity of similar to 1080 mA h g(-1), admirable cyclic stability/lifespan (capacity loss rate: similar to 0.03% per cycle), and excellent rate capabilities. Our work may hold a great potential in rational design of superior cathodes for applicable Li-S cell systems.

It significantly boosts the performance of a simple 70 wt % S/MWCNTs (MWCNTs = multi-walled carbon nanotubes) cathode, achieving high initial capacities (e.g., 1406 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, 1203 mAh g(-1) at 1C), nearly 100% Coulombic efficiencies, and high reversible capacities after cycle tests (e.g., 828.4 mAh g(-1) at 1C after 100 cycles) at both low and high current rates.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is hampered by fast capacity fade during both dynamic cell cycling and static cell resting. The poor electrochemical stability is due to polysulfide diffusion, leading to a short cycle life and severe self-discharge. Here, we present the design of a bifunctional separator with a light-weight carbon-coating that integrates the two necessary components already inside the cell: the conductive carbon and the separator. With no extra additives, this bifunctional carbon-coated separator allows the use of pure sulfur cathodes involving no complex composite synthesis process, provides a high initial discharge capacity of 1389 mA h g(-1) with excellent dynamic stability, and facilitates a high reversible capacity of 828 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. In addition, the static stability is evidenced by low self-discharge and excellent capacity retention after a 3 month rest period.

However, due to dynamical interfaces driven by phase evolution between the conductive hosts and S-containing guests during cycling, the cathode still faces poor stability. Herein, the use of O-/N-containing nanocarbon as the conductive host sheds a light on the role of the dynamic interface between the carbon host and S-containing guest for a stable Li-S cell. The outstanding reversibility and stability of N-doped C/S cathodes are attributed to the favorable guest-host interaction at the electron-modified interface, manifesting as (i) a chemical gradient to adsorb polar polysulfides and (ii) ameliorative deposition and recharging of Li2S on the region of electron-rich pyridinic N and a graphene domain surrounding quaternary N. Highly reversible, efficient and stable Li storage properties such as mitigated polarization and charge barrier, high capacity of 1370 and 964 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 1.0 C, respectively, and 70% of capacity retention after 200 cycles are achieved. Mechanistic insight into the capacity fading inspires the rational design on electrodes for high-performance electrochemical systems.

However, their development is hampered by the short cycling life and severe polarization induced by shuttle effect of polysulfides and sluggish kinetics of Li2S. Herein, for the first time, LiTi2(PO4)(2.88)F-0.12 (LTP-F-0.12) is proposed to anchor and activate sulfide based on its strong interaction with lithium polysulfide and rapid charge transfer behavior. By adding 10 wt% LTP-F-0.12 to the cathode, the discharge capacity and discharge rate performance were apparently improved, while the capacity retention of about 70% at 0.1C after 200 cycles was realized, which was much higher than that of pure SP-S cathode (lower than 50%). The activation energy (voltage polarization) was decreased by almost 40%. Additional capacity of 132 mA h g(-1) was also provided by the LTP-F-0.12 from 3.0 to 1.85 V. This study presents a new insight in promoting the polysulfide conversion kinetics in the sulfur cathode.

This paper describes novel hierarchical yolk-shell microspheres comprising 1D bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) encapsulating Co nanoparticles (Co@BNCNTs YS microspheres) as efficient cathode hosts for Li-S batteries. The microspheres are produced via a two-step process that involves generation of the microsphere followed by N-doped CNTs growth. The hierarchical yolk-shell structure enables efficient sulfur loading and mitigates the dissolution of lithium polysulfides, and metallic Co and N doping improves the chemical affinity of the microspheres with sulfur species. Accordingly, a Co@BNCNTs YS microsphere-based cathode containing 64 wt% sulfur exhibits a high discharge capacity of 700.2 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at a current density of 1 C (based on the mass of sulfur); this corresponds to a good capacity retention of 76% and capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle with an excellent rate performance (752 mA h g(-1) at 2.0 C) when applied as cathode hosts for Li-S batteries.

However, because SPAN electrodes are synthesized using powder, they require large amounts of electrolyte, conducting agents, and binder, which reduces the practical energy density. Herein, to improve the practical energy density, we fabricated bulk-type SPAN disk cathodes from pressed sulfur and polyacrylonitrile powders using a simple heating process. The SPAN disks could be used directly as cathode materials because their pi-pi structures provide molecular-level electrical connectivity. In addition, the electrodes had interconnected pores, which improved the mobility of Li+ ions by allowing homogeneous adsorption of the electrolyte. The specific capacity of the optimal electrode was very high (517 mA h g(electrode)(-1)). Furthermore, considering the weights of the anode, separator, cathode, and electrolyte, the Li/S cell exhibited a high practical energy density of 250 W h kg(-1). The areal capacity was also high (8.5 mA h cm(-2)) owing to the high SPAN loading of 16.37 mg cm(-2). After the introduction of 10 wt% multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a conducting agent, the SPAN disk electrode exhibited excellent cyclability while maintaining a high energy density. This strategy offers a potential candidate for Li/S batteries with high practical energy densities.

Significantly, thanks to the high density of lithium ions on MoS2 surface, this composite separator shows high lithium conductivity, fast lithium diffusion, and facile lithium transference. When used in Li-S batteries, the separator is proven to be highly efficient for depressing polysulfides shuttle, leading to high and long cycle stability. With 65% of sulfur loading, the device with MoS2/Celgard separator delivers an initial capacity of 808 mAh g(-1) and a substantial capacity of 401 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles, corresponding to only 0.083% of capacity decay per cycle that is comparable to the best reported result so far. In addition, the Coulombic efficiency remains more than 99.5% during all 600 cycles, disclosing an efficient ionic sieve preventing polysulfides migration to the anode while having negligible influence on Li+ ions transfer across the separator. The strategy demonstrated in this work will open the door toward developing efficient separators with flexible 2D materials beyond graphene for energy-storage devices.

J	Pai, R; Singh, A; Tang, MH; Kalra, V				Pai, Rahul; Singh, Arvinder; Tang, Maureen H.; Kalra, Vibha			Stabilization of gamma sulfur at room temperature to enable the use of carbonate electrolyte in Li-S batteries	COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDE	Lithium sulfur batteries are an emerging energy storage medium, but their stability in carbonate electrolyte remains hampered by side-reactions. Here, the authors show that as-produced monoclinic gamma-sulfur on activated carbon nanofibers converts to Li2S without the formation of intermediate polysulfides, therefore eliminating irreversible side reactions and improving cycling stability. This past decade has seen extensive research in lithium-sulfur batteries with exemplary works mitigating the notorious polysulfide shuttling. However, these works utilize ether electrolytes that are highly volatile severely hindering their practicality. Here, we stabilize a rare monoclinic gamma-sulfur phase within carbon nanofibers that enables successful operation of Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries in carbonate electrolyte for 4000 cycles. Carbonates are known to adversely react with the intermediate polysulfides and shut down Li-S batteries in first discharge. Through electrochemical characterization and post-mortem spectroscopy/ microscopy studies on cycled cells, we demonstrate an altered redox mechanism in our cells that reversibly converts monoclinic sulfur to Li2S without the formation of intermediate polysulfides for the entire range of 4000 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the synthesis of stable gamma-sulfur and its application in Li-S batteries. We hope that this striking discovery of solid-to-solid reaction will trigger new fundamental and applied research in carbonate electrolyte Li-S batteries.

Imparting high robustness and suppression ability of shuttle effect to sulfur cathode in the Li-S battery via a novel multifunctional binder	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Li-S battery; Polymer binder; Shuttle effect; Polyrotaxane; Structural integrity	PROCESSABLE POLYMER BINDER; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; BETA-CYCLODEXTRIN; POLYACRYLIC-ACID; LITHIUM; CARBON; DERIVATIVES; NANOSHEETS; SEPARATOR; NANOTUBES	To retard the performance degradation of sulfur cathode in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries originating from severe volume variation and intermediate polysulfides shuttle effect during charge and discharge process, commercial polyacrylic acid (PAA) crosslinked by cationic hydroxypropyl polyrotaxane (HPRN+) is used as a water-based multifunctional binder (PAA-HPRN+) of the cathode for the first time. The assembled Li-S battery with the simple sulfur/carbon composite cathode adhered by PAA-HPRN+ displays an outstanding cycling specific capacity retention of 59.9% after 900 cycles at 1.0 C, and the corresponding capacity fading rate per cycle is 0.0446%, which are better than many reported values. Moreover, the cathode also exhibits excellent specific capacity and cycling stability even under high sulfur loading. The superior electrochemical properties are attributed to the slipping of the polyrotaxane that provides the binder with improved mechanical robustness and trapping capability of the soluble polysulfides that suppresses shuttle effect. The proposed design of the multifunctional binder may help to realize practical application of the Li-S battery. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Xie, Z. H.; Huang, Z. X.; Rong, M.

However, a small sulfur loading and limited utilization of active material hamper its practical application. Besides, an elevated temperature is usually required for the operation of SSLSBs. In the present work, a homogeneous nanostructured sulfur-Ketjen black (S@KB) composite cathode was synthesized through an energy-efficient deposition method. A stable and highly ionic conductive composite polymer-ceramic electrolyte (CPE) was employed as the solid-state electrolyte. The SSLSB delivered a pronounced specific capacity of 1108 mA h g(-1) and areal capacity of 1.77 mA h cm(-2), and demonstrated stable cycling for 50 cycles. Also, benefiting from fast reaction kinetics, the SSLSB was able to operate at 20 degrees C and established an excellent rate capability. These results emphasize the morphology control of the cathode plays a critical role in the electrochemical performance of SSLSBs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the fast capacity decay caused by lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) dissolution impedes its prospect for commercialization. In this work, nitrogen-doped graphene, as a chemical immobilizer, was designed to bind LiPSs and stabilize sulfur in the cathode for high performance LieS batteries. The incorporated nitrogen dopants in the graphene network were found to have a strong binding effect on the LiPSs to improve electrochemical stability and promote fast electrochemical reaction kinetics. As a result, the nitrogen doped graphene-based sulfur electrode could deliver an initial capacity of similar to 1200 mAh g(-1) at 0.3 A g(-1), and exhibit good capacity retention with only 0.05% capacity decay per cycle after 300 cycles at 0.75 A g(-1).

It is found that graphene oxide (GO) with a porous structure offers flexible confinement function that helps prevent the loss of active materials, thus extending the cycling life of the electrode. Moreover, reduced graphene oxide provides a conductive network surrounding the sulfur particles, which facilitates both electron transport and ion transportation. This novel one-step, all-solution-based process is scalable and provides a promising approach for potential industrial applications.

Furthermore, as an efficient sulfur host, NiFe2O4 hollow spheres can further absorb the soluble polysulfides by strong chemical interaction due to their intrinsic polarity and also serve as a catalyst to promote the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion. Benefiting from the synergism of the physical confinement, polar chemical adsorption, and catalytic conversion, the as-prepared flexible NiFe2O4@S/C electrode delivers a high initial capacity of 1193 mAh at 100 mA g(-1) and excellent long-term cycling stability up to 500 cycles with a low decay rate of 0.059% per cycle at 500 mA g(-1).

Role of the solvent in the activation of Li2S as cathode material: a DFT study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						lithium sulfide cathode; lithium sulfur batteries; density functional calculations	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; DOPED GRAPHENE; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; MECHANISMS; SURFACE; POINTS	Lithium-sulfur batteries are considered one of the possible next-generation energy-storage solutions, but to be commercially available many drawbacks have yet to be solved. One solution with great potentiality is the use of lithium sulfide as cathode material since it can be coupled to Li-free anodes, such as graphite, Si or Sn. Nevertheless, Li2S, like sulfur, is electronically and ionically insulating, with a high activation potential for its initial oxidation step. To overcome this issue, different strategies have been explored, one of them being the use of catalytic surfaces. In the present article, we study using first principles calculations the effect of the dielectric constant of the solvent on the activation energy of the cleavage reaction of Li2S on different catalytic surfaces. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a study is undertaken. We find that the effect of the solvent should be twofold: on one side, it should decrease the interaction between the Li2S molecule and the surface. On the other side, since the species arising in the dissociation reaction are charged, the solvent should decrease the activation barrier for the dissociation of the Li2S molecule, when compared with the reaction in vacuum. These theoretical findings are discussed in connection with experimental results from the literature, where the behaviour of the Li-S cathode is studied in different solvents.

Durable Carbon-Coated Li2S Core-Shell Spheres for High Performance Lithium/Sulfur Cells	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; SULFUR BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIAL; GRAPHENE OXIDE; HIGH-CAPACITY; SULFIDE; PARTICLES; ELECTROLYTE; MOLECULES	Lithium sulfide (Li2S) is an attractive cathode material with a high theoretical specific capacity (1166 mAh g(-1)). However, the poor cycle life and rate capability have remained significant challenges, preventing its practical application. Here, Li2S spheres with size control have been synthesized for the first time, and a CVD method for converting them into stable carbon-coated Li2S core-shell (Li2S@C) particles has been successfully employed. These Li2S@C particles with protective and conductive carbon shells show promising specific capacities and cycling performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 972 mAh g(-1) Li2S (1394 mAh g(-1) S) at the 0.2C rate. Even with no added carbon, a very high Li2S content (88 wt % Li2S) electrode composed of 98 wt % 1 mu m Li2S@C spheres and 2 wt % binder shows rather stable cycling performance, and little morphology change after 400 cycles at the 0.5C rate.

Herein, we propose a multi-porous conductive architecture through bridging conductive TiN nanoparticle over the surface of CNT-S composite. The as-prepared TiN@CNT-S composite cathode delivers the superior initial specific capacity of 1269 mAh g(-1) at 0.05C and as high as 586 mAh g(-1) at 2C. The reversible capacity of the TiN@CNT-S composite cathode is about two times higher than the bare cathode without TiN conductive bridging at 1C over 400 cycles. A high areal capacity of 4.0 mAh cm(-2) was realized for the TiN@CNT-S composite cathode with a high areal sulfur loading of 5.4 mg cm(-2) at a current rate of 0.5C over 50 cycles. The enhancements in the electrochemical performances are mainly ascribed to the TiN bridged highly conductive structure; the formation of the strong chemical interaction of S-N-Ti bond for polysulfides trapping provided by the chemically polar TiN, which is verified by the ultraviolet visible (UV) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses.

Nano-carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene are widely used in the electrode technology of energy storage batteries because of their many useful properties, including high electrical conductivity, outstanding mechanical strength, and unique morphology and structure characteristics. This paper provides an overview about the most recent progress in the applications of carbon nanotubes and graphene (e.g., composite electrode materials, anode active materials and conductive additives in lithium ion batteries, as well as composite conductive matrices in novel Li-S batteries). The electrochemical performance of the batteries affected by their different application modes in terms of lithium storage capability, rate capacity and cycle life are highlighted. Discussions on challenges and perspectives of these carbon materials in this exciting field such as exploring low cost and environmental friendly synthesis techniques for high-quality materials, improving the dispersion technology for efficient design of hybrid nanostructured materials and seeking for new application modes are also presented.

Surface area analysis and field emission scanning electron microscope imaging show that the ball-milled sulfur powder has a porous structure and very high specific surface area. A vacuum-filtrated single-walled carbon nanotube free-standing layer is inserted in between the sulfur cathode and the separator. It is believed that high-surface-area porous sulfur will help to increase the conductivity of the elemental sulfur due to better adhesion between the conducting carbon and the sulfur, while the free-standing layer will sequester longer chain polysulfides, which are responsible for the well-known shuttling phenomenon. By the combination of these methods, we have achieved excellent capacity and cycle life. Finally, a new charging method which will largely prevent the formation of longer chain polysulfides is also applied to increase the capacity retention. It is believed that with the combination of ball milling, the free-standing layer, and the new charging method, it is possible to commercialize the Li-S battery with better capacity and cycle life.

Research on their potential applications in electrochemical energy storage devices is just budding, and needs bold and active exploration. Here, a multifunctional Sc2O3@CNT-coated separator was developed and introduced into the Li-S battery system, simply by coating a thin and lightweight capping layer of a synthesized composite of Sc2O3 nanocrystal decorated carbon nanotubes (Sc2O3@CNTs) over one side of a commercial separator. The Li-S battery based on the Sc2O3@CNT-coated separator possesses very important properties, including high capacity, superior cycling stability, impressive rate performance, favorable anti-self-discharge capabilities, and greatly mitigated anode corrosion. Theoretical computation and experimental results demonstrate that such outstanding electrochemical properties originate from the synergy of CNTs and Sc2O3, which enables the Sc2O3@CNT-coated separator to achieve an optimal balance of multiple functions: (1) physically blocking polysulfide migration and acting as an upper current collector, (2) chemically anchoring polysulfide species, and (3) catalytically promoting the conversion of sulfur species into Li2S2/Li2S. This work first applies Sc2O3 to Li-S batteries, and the encouraging results show great potential of rare earth oxides for producing high-performance energy storage devices.

However, lean condition makes the electrolyte-related interface discrete, leading to retardation of ion transfer that depends on interfaces. Consequently, electrochemical reactions face restraint. Herein, lithium polyacrylate acid (LiPAA) with short-chain anions (molecular weight of 2000) is introduced into the cathode. Because of the polysulfide (PS)-philic instinct of the short-chain PAA anions, short-chain PS is captured inside of the cathode. In addition, LiPAA supplies Li+ to the short-chain PS captured. The strong interaction between Li2S4 and LiPAA effectively decreases Li2S4 migration to the anode during discharging. In a sense, the ion mass transfer pattern is thus changed comparing to traditional long-way mode between cathode and anode. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) proves that the interfacial reaction resistance is greatly decreased in the region where Li2Sx (x <= 4) reduction contributes most. In the same time, the reversibility of electrochemical reduction/oxidation is improved. Owing to the accelerated Li2Sx (x <= 4) reduction, Li implanting of only 0.3 wt.% plus O introduction up to 1.4 wt.% enables the LSB perform well even with 1/4 of regular electrolyte dosage (5 mu L mg(-1)) and high-sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm(-2)), increasing its rate capacity C-0.8/0.5 from 52.6% (without the LiPAA) to 92.3% (with the LiPAA) as well as a capacity of 518.7 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at 0.8 mA cm(-2).

In this paper, lightweight macromolecule graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) film and a conductive polymer (CP) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) shell are introduced into flexible LSBs by compositing with carbon cloth (CC). In the designed hybrid of CP/g-C3N4@CC, 2D g-C(3)N(4)is used in the form of an effective trapper and functions as a continuous catalytic layer for LiPSs via the formation of pyridinic-N-Li bonds. This is revealed by both experimental investigations and theoretical analysis. The sandwich-like CC and CP simultaneously bring an omnidirectional conductive network for fast interfacial reaction kinetics. With these benefits, the self-supported CP/g-C3N4@CC forms a powerful interaction system to fully in situ "lock" LiPSs in the commercial CC matrix. Thus, a substantially enhanced electrochemical performance is obtained at a high sulfur loading (4.7 mg cm(-2)) even operating in a pouch cell. This work may provide a potential avenue for practical use of high-performance LSBs toward flexible energy-storage devices.

However, there are still some challenges for the commercialization of LSBs, such as the sluggish redox reaction kinetics and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS). Here a 2D layered organic material, C2N, loaded with atomically dispersed iron as an effective sulfur host in LSBs is reported. X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations prove the structure of the atomically dispersed Fe/C2N catalyst. As a result, Fe/C2N-based cathodes demonstrate significantly improved rate performance and long-term cycling stability. Fe/C2N-based cathodes display initial capacities up to 1540 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 678.7 mAh g(-1) at 5 C, while retaining 496.5 mAh g(-1) after 2600 cycles at 3 C with a decay rate as low as 0.013% per cycle. Even at a high sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2), they deliver remarkable specific capacity retention of 587 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C. This work provides a rational structural design strategy for the development of high-performance cathodes based on atomically dispersed catalysts for LSBs.

Then the film was sulfurized by heating to form composite film of sulfur and carbon fibers, which was then used as cathode materials of lithium/sulfur battery. Morphology and structure of films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Electrochemical performance of the composite film was tested by methods of constant current charge-discharge and measurement of impedance. Results indicate that as distance between filament and substrate of iron foil decreases, the density of carbon fiber film increases firstly and decreases afterward. And the density increases with the diminishing volume Row ratio between H-2 and (Ar+C3H6O). When the distance between filament and substrate is 6 mm and the volume flow ratio is 30/40, dense carbon fiber film with thickness of 50 mu m is deposited on iron foil. Those carbon fibers are mainly vertically oriented and have relative high degree of crystalline. In the composite film of sulfur and carbon fibers, dense carbon fibers form evenly distributed electrically conductive framework with vertical orientation. When current density is 0.4 mA.cm(-2), initial discharge specific capacity of the composite film is 1 128 mAh.g(-1) and the discharge specific capacity is 811 mAh.g(-1) after 50 cycles.

To tackle these challenges, the amorphous CoP anchored on N-doped carbon nanospheres with hollow porous structures (CoP/HCS) has been synthesized as a superior sulfur host via a facial pyrolysis approach. The debilitating effect would be hampered during the cycling processing resulting from two reasons:(1) the powerful chemical anchoring between unsaturated Co and Li-polysulfides, (2) the remarkable adaption of volume variation originating from the hollow porous architectures. The amorphous CoP nanoparticles not only catalyze the transformation of lithium polysulfides as electrocatalyst, but also acquired a high sulfur loading as sulfur host materials. More importantly, the synergistic incorporation of CoP and HCS improved the inherit low conductivity by anchoring on the N-doped carbon hollow, thus leading to excellent performance for Li-S batteries. Benefiting from these advantages, the amorphous CoP/HCS-based sulfur electrodes exhibited outstanding rate performance (685.6 mAh g-1 at 3C), excellent long-cycling stability with a low capacity decay of only 0.03% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2C, and a high areal capacity of 5.16 mAh cm-2 under high sulfur loading.

A facile poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-assisted solvothermal method is reported here to prepare Mg-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate metal organic framework (MOF) from which mesoporous carbon is derived by thermal treatment, where the hexagonal sheetlike morphology of the parent MOF is retained. Existence of abundant pores of size 4 and 9 nm extended in three dimensions with zigzag mazelike channels helps trapping of S in the carbon matrix through capillary effect, resulting in high S loading. When tested as a cathode for lithium-sulfur battery, a reversible specific capacity of 1184 mAh g(-1) could be achieved at 0.02 C. As evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ generated Mg in the carbon structure enhances the conductivity, whereas MgO provides support to S immobilization through chemical interactions between Mg and sulfur species for surface polarity compensation, restricting the dissolution of polysulfide into the electrolyte, the main cause for the "shuttle phenomenon" and consequent capacity fading. The developed cathode shows good electrochemical stability with reversible capacities of 602 and 328 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 and 1.0 C, respectively, with retentions of 64 and 67% after 200 cycles. The simple MOF-derived strategy adopted here would help design new carbon materials for Li-S cathode support.

Among them, multiscale porous architecutures are highly desired to tackle the limitations of single-sized porous architectures, and to combine the advantages of different pore scales. Although a few carbonaceous materials with multiscale porosity are employed in LSBs, their nonpolar surface properties cause the severe dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). In this context, multiscale porous structure design of noncarbonaceous materials is highly required, but has not been exploited in LSBs yet because of the absence of a facile method to control the multiscale porous inorganic materials. Here, a hierarchically porous titanium nitride (h-TiN) is reported as a multifunctional sulfur host, integrating the advantages of multiscale porous architectures with intrinsic surface properties of TiN to achieve high-rate and long-life LSBs. The macropores accommodate the high amount of sulfur, facilitate the electrolyte penetration and transportation of Li+ ions, while the mesopores effectively prevent the LiPS dissolution. TiN strongly adsorbs LiPS, mitigates the shuttle effect, and promotes the redox kinetics. Therefore, h-TiN/S shows a reversible capacity of 557 mA h g(-1) even after 1000 cycles at 5 C rate with only 0.016% of capacity decay per cycle.

Herein, porous N-doped Ti3C2 MXene (P-NTC) has been realized by a scalable sacrificial templating route, resulting in the rational design of active electrocatalyst for Li-S chemistry. Benefiting from the superb electron conductivity, large surface area and strong interaction with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), P-NTC can trigger the surface-mediated redox reaction of LiPSs. Moreover, the homogenous nitrogen doping on Ti3C2 gives rise to enhanced interfacial interaction with Li atom and lowered dissociation barrier for Li2S. Therefore, the template-derived P-NTC not only acts as an effective LiPS immobilizer but also serves as a multifunctional electrocatalyst to propel the nucleation and decomposition of Li2S in discharge and charge processes, respectively. As expected, thus-fabricated S/P-NTC cathode maintains a low capacity decay of only 0.033% per cycle at 2.0 C over 1200 cycles. In further contexts, our ability to tune the sulfur mass loadings enables fabricated cathodes to harvest a high areal capacity of 9.0 mAh cm(-2), holding great promise in future practical applications.

In this work, mesoporous hollow carbon-coated MnO nanospheres (C@MnO) have been designed and synthesized using spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPB) as template, KMnO4 as MnO precursor, and polydopamine as carbon source to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery. The hollow C@MnO nanospheres enable the combination of physical confinement and chemical adsorption of the LiPSs. The thin carbon coating layer can provide good electrical conductivity and additional physical confinement to polysulfides. Moreover, the encapsulated MnO inside the carbon shell exhibits strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides. The constructed C@MnO/S cathode shows the discharge capacity of 1026 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C with 79% capacity retention after 80 cycles. The synthesized hollow C@MnO nanoparticles can work as highly efficient sulfur host materials, providing an effective solution to suppress the shuttle effect in Li-S battery.

In this work, two types of niobium (Nb)-based inorganics, semiconductive Nb2O5 and conductive NbC, are implanted into hollow carbon nanospheres (HCN) hosts, which can realize the cooperativity of nanospace confinement and high-efficiency catalytic Nb-based inorganics for high-rate Li-S batteries. The initial HCN have adequate hollow space achieving high sulfur loading, interpenetrated mesoporous channels for rapid ion transfer, and developed microporous carbon framework blocking the polysulfides shuttling. While Nb-based inorganics are uniformly located in the mesoporous channels, they can accelerate the conversion kinetics of the polysulfides by strong chemical interaction and high catalytic effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the conductive NbC performs much better catalytic activity than the Nb2O5, with significantly improved redox kinetic and cycling performance. The optimized HCN@NbC/S cathode delivers a preeminent reversible capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) with a low capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle over 800 cycles at 3 C and a high rate capacity of 752 mAh g(-1) under a high current density of 5 C. This work provides a novel strategy to construct desirable multifunctional host favoring cooperative polysulfides interactions via rational integration of physical confinement and high-effective catalytic inorganics for long-cycling stable sulfur cathode.

This trilayer membrane (TLM) was subjected to ionic conductivity, thermal stability and contact angle measurements. Each layer of the TLM functions for a specific purpose: the MWCNTs provide electronic conductivity while the pores of the Celgard 2320 membrane facilitate lithium-ion transport and MgAl2O4 suppresses the shuttling of polysulfides due to the electrostatic attractive force. The TLM exhibited superior thermal stability and ionic conductivity than the uncoated Celgard 2320 membrane. The Li-S cell with a TLM offered a higher discharge capacity than the one with an uncoated membrane. The results are compared with earlier reports.

A Synergetic Effect Between Lithium Polysulfide Anchoring and Lithium Dendrite Suppression for High-performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Using Cellulose Paper	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Li-S; anchoring; polar-polar interaction; KimWipe paper; lithium polysulfide	HIERARCHICAL POROUS CARBON; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; AMORPHOUS-CARBON; DEPOSITION; ANODE; ARCHITECTURE; ELECTRODE; NETWORKS; CATHODE; EDGE	This study aims to resolve the performance issues of Li-S batteries using KimWipes in three cell configurations cathode-side, anode-side, and both-sides. A no-KimWipe cell configuration is considered as a control. Substantial suppression of lithium polysulfide shuttling in the cathode-side configuration is observed owing to polar-polar interaction between higher-order dissolved polysulfides (Li2S8 to Li2S4) and abundant polar functional groups in the fibrous cellulose network of the KimWipes. On the anode side, KimWipes serve the dual roles of facilitating the homogeneous redistribution of Li ions during plating and stripping while minimizing the anchoring of polysulfide species migrating from the cathode. An electrochemical performance test is performed out at a C-rate of 0.1C, and the discharge-specific capacities at the first cycle for the cathode-side, anode-side, both-sides, and no-KimWipe cell configurations were 1,464.36, 1,286.95, 1,033.96, and 927.22 mAh g(-1) S, respectively. Experimental testing is performed for upto 250 cycles for type II and III cells, which show good specific discharge, capacities as well as stable reversibility and coulombic efficiency. The cathode-side KimWipe cell configuration maintained stable reversibility with a higher coulombic efficiency. Results of this study will contribute towards realizing high-performance Li-S batteries for commercial applications.	[Dharavath, Ravindar; Murali, Ashwin; Balasubramanian, T.

The SiO2/Ni(OH)(2)@PDA composite is firstly synthesized by depositing Ni(OH)(2) on silica spheres and then coating carbon precursor of polydopamine (PDA) shell. Then, the process of carbonization and KOH etching transforms the PDA into carbon and removes the silica core, respectively. Finally, sulfur is impregnated into the NH@HCS by heat treatment to obtain NH@HCS-S composites. Through experimental studies, it is demonstrated that the hybrid sulfur host formed by carbon spheres and hydroxide nickel hydroxide embraces high electronic conductivity as well as strong physical absorption and chemical affinity.

One major challenge in this system stems from the formation of soluble polysulfides during the reduction of S-8, the active cathode material, during discharge. The ability to deploy this system hinges on the ability to control the behavior of these polysulfides by containing them in the cathode and allowing for further redox. Here, we exploit the high surface areas and good electrical conductivity of mesoporous carbons (MC) to achieve high sulfur utilization while functionalizing the MC with sulfur (S-MC) in order to modify the surface chemistry and attract polysulfides to the carbon material. S-MC materials show enhanced capacity and cyclability trending as a function of sulfur functionality, specifically a 50% enhancement in discharge capacity is observed at high cycles (60-100 cycles). Impedance spectroscopy suggests that the S-MC materials exhibit a lower charge-transfer resistance compared with MC materials which allows for more efficient electrochemistry with species in solution at the cathode. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that the change in surface chemistry from unfunctionalized to S-functionalized carbons results in an increased affinity of the polysulfide intermediates for the S MC materials, which is the likely cause for enhanced cyclability.

J	Fu, XW; Scudiero, L; Zhong, WH				Fu, Xuewei; Scudiero, Louis; Zhong, Wei-Hong			A robust and ion- conductive protein- based binder enabling strong polysulfide anchoring for highenergy lithium- sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							TRAPPING POLYSULFIDES; CARBON NANOFIBERS; POLYACRYLIC-ACID; SELF-DISCHARGE; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; CATHODE; TRANSPORT; COMPOSITES; INTERLAYER	Due to the large volume change of sulfur and the diffusion of dissolved polysulfides, the development of a high-performance binder with functionality beyond mechanical adhesion/support for sulfur cathodes is in high demand. This is especially true for the success of high-loading sulfur cathodes. Here, we report a soy-protein-based binder with high mechanical robustness and multiple functionality for high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries. The multi-functional binder (denoted as SP-PAA) is fabricated via facilely incorporating soy protein (SP) with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and it has been demonstrated to effectively buffer the large volume change of the sulfur cathode during cycling. More significantly, the abundant polar groups (e.g. amines, carboxyl groups, etc.) of soy protein empower the binder with a strong capability to adsorb polysulfides, as evidenced by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Meanwhile, the good ion-conduction abilities of soy protein notably promote electrochemical reactions. With the use of this binder, the electrochemical performance (e.g. capacity, cycling stability and rate capability) of the sulfur cathode is substantially enhanced. In addition, owing to the excellent mechanical properties of SP-PAA and its effects on improving electrode microstructures, high-loading sulfur cathodes (>5 mg cm(-2)) with good and stable performance are achieved. The good performance is also attributed to the role that SP-PAA plays in adsorbing polysulfides, sustaining structural stability and promoting electrochemical reactions. This study brings about a cost-effective strategy for the fabrication of superior binders through exploiting natural materials and leads to the realization of high-loading sulfur cathodes for mass production.

J	Guo, JL; Zhao, SP; He, GH; Zhang, FX				Guo, Junling; Zhao, Shupeng; He, Gaohong; Zhang, Fengxiang			Novel Synergistic Strategy for Developing High-Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries of Large Areal Sulfur Loading by SEI Modified Separator	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						Li-S battery; solid electrolyte interface; CNT array; large areal sulfur loading; separator	SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; IONIC-LIQUID; GRAPHITE ANODES; CATHODE; SURFACE; BINDER	As a crucial energy density determining factor, the areal sulfur loading is still low nowadays for practical applications of Li-S batteries. To address this issue, intensive research efforts have been devoted to development of sulfur-hosting materials with ultrahigh specific surface area. However, design and manufacturing processes for these materials are complicated. Herein, we report a novel and facile strategy for developing a high-performance cathode with high areal sulfur content using conventional sulfur hosts without ultrahigh specific area. This strategy features a dense blocking layer of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the separator to ensure cycle stability of the cathode with a high areal sulfur loading. Meanwhile, a nanoarray cathode structure (CNT array on carbon cloth) is adopted to guarantee high sulfur utilization and rate performance. With the synergistic effect of a dense blocking layer and CNT array structure, the cathode with 10 mg/cm(2) sulfur (90.9% in CNT/S composite) shows good rate and cycle performance.

Here, we report an ingenious design of hollow carbon nanofibers with closed ends and protogenetic mesopores in the shell that can be retracted to micropores after sulfur infusion. Such dynamic adjustable pore sizes ensure a high sulfur loading, and more importantly, eliminate excessive contact of sulfur species with the electrolyte. Together, the high aspect ratio and thin carbon shells of the carbon nanofibers facilitate rapid transport of Li+ ions and electrons, and the closed-end structure of the carbon nanofibers further blocks polysulfide dissolution from both ends, which is remarkably different from that for carbon nanotubes with open ends. The obtained sulfur-carbon cathodes exhibit excellent performance marked by high sulfur utilization, superior rate capability (1,170, 1,050, and 860 mA.h.g(-1) at 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 C (1 C = 1.675 A.g(-1)), respectively), and a stable reversible capacity of 847 mA.h.g(-1) after 300 cycles at a high rate of 2.0 C.

Here, the Co-Fe bimetallic sulfides were systematically synthesized by adjusting the metal source ratio at the precursor. The superior CFS-2/CP was served as interlayer to compare the chemical binding with FeS2/CP, CoS2/CP and CP interlayer. The fishnet feature of CP contributes the physical adsorptivity for polysulfides. The catalytic kinetics CFS-2/CP interlayer was evaluated by Tafel slop and lithium ion diffusion coefficient. The interaction of bimetallic sulfides and polysulfides was investigated by XPS analysis. CFS-2/CP with Co ions and Fe ions as the catalytic sites shows the outstanding catalytic activity and chemical adsorptivity for polysulfides. Importantly, CFS-2/CP interlayer exhibited a high reversible capacity of 1126.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, a long cycle life of more than 400 cycles and a low capacity loss ratio of 0.11% per cycle.

However, the reported carbon hybrids always require a tedious fabrication process, including multistep chemical vapor deposition and a thermally stable catalyst. Therefore, it is highly desirable to exploit a simple, renewable, and scalable strategy to fabricate 3D heteroatom-doped carbon hybrids. Herein, a N, P-co-doped 3D carbon hybrid was successfully fabricated via a one-pot pyrolysis process. Due to the rapid Li+/e(-) transport among the 3D interconnected porous frameworks and effectively suppressed polysulfide dissolution by physical confinement and chemical interaction, the assembled Li-S batteries exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. The as-obtained cell delivers an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 1446 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C as well as an excellent rate capability of 921 mA h g(-1) at 1C. Additionally, a reversible and stable discharge capacity of 795 mA h g(-1) is maintained after 400 cycles at 1C, corresponding to an extremely low capacity decay of 0.034% per cycle. Such a design strategy is eco-friendly and generally applicable to combine the sp(2) nanocarbon with sp(3) amorphous carbon, which is crucial to construct 3D interconnected hierarchical porous carbons for advanced energy storage for applications in various fields, such as lithium batteries, catalysis and hydrogen storage.

Li-S batteries currently use ether-based electrolytes with high polysulfide solubility. Until now, however, the necessary requirements and the roles of the electrolytes have been inconclusive. This work elucidates the essential features and functions of the electrolyte based on an intensive investigation into 17 variants of solvents. Furthermore, examples of electrolytes for high performance, rechargeable Li-S batteries are suggested. The three major study procedures are (1) analyzing the chemical stability of reactive polysulfide species and lithium metal in the solvents of choice, (2) inspecting the chemical reactivity of lithium metal in a polysulfide solution, and (3) evaluating the influences of the solvent on the performance of Li-S cells. Based on the chemical and electrochemical test results, we suggest that the stability of the active materials (i.e., lithium metal and lithium polysulfides) should be ensured in an electrolyte for the proper operation of Li-S cells, that chemical reactions between the polysulfide species and lithium metal should be negligible during the charge-discharge process. In addition, we have confirmed that the high polysulfide solubility is essential for high rate performance.

However, it suffers from low cycling stability, low-rate capability and high initial activation potential. In addition, commercially available Li2S is of high cost and of large size, over ten microns, which further exacerbate its shortcomings as a sulfur cathode. Exploring new approaches to fabricate small-sized Li2S of low cost and to achieve Li2S cathodes of high electrochemical performance is highly desired. This work reports a novel mechanochemical method for synthesizing Li2S of high purity and submicron size by ball-milling LiH with sulfur in an Ar atmosphere at room temperature. By further milling the as-synthesized Li2S with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) followed by carbonization of PAN at 1000 degrees C, a Li2S/C hybrid with nano-sized Li2S embedded in a mesoporous carbon matrix is achieved. The hybrid with Li2S as high as 74 wt% shows a high initial capacity of 971 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and retains a capacity of 570 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles as a cathode material for LSBs. A capacity of 610 mA h g(-1) is obtained at 1C. The synthesis method of Li2S is facile, environmentally benign, and of high output and low cost. The present work opens a new route for the scalable fabrication of submicron-sized Li2S and for the development of high performance Li2S-based cathodes.

A monodispersed MnOx-CeO2 solid solution nanoparticles grown on reduced graphene oxide (MnOx-CeO2@rGO) is designed as effective electrocatalyst to facilitate the precipitation and conversion of Li2S. Alien Mn atoms doping modulates the electronic structure of CeO2 matrix and induces more oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and boots the intrinsic catalytic activity for Li2S nucleation. Moreover, the monodispersity of ultra-small MnOx-CeO2 nanoparticles can provide enough active facets for sufficient Li2S precipitation. To reveal the electrocatalytic effect of MnOx-CeO2@rGO on Li2S precipitation, mesoporous SiO2@rGO nanosheets with numerous polar surface for strong LiPSs adsorption is adopt as a reference. The results of potentiostatic discharge deposition indicates that MnOx-CeO2@rGO reduces the overpotential for the rapid Li2S precipitation, avoiding the accumulation of LiPSs on the active sites. Such features offer the cell with MnOx-CeO2@rGO coated separator an excellent high rate capacity (630 mAh g(-1) at 3C) and long-term cyclic stability (capacity fading of 0.036% per cycle at 1C for 1000 cycles).

The type of carbon additive significantly affected the initial capacity reduction, though it did not affect the cycling stability of the sulfur cathodes. The cathodes that incorporated mesoporous and macroporous carbon additives delivered much higher initial capacities of similar to 970 and similar to 900 mAh/g, respectively, compared with those (similar to 715 mAh/g) with graphite and microporous carbon additives. The EDS results showed that these features are strongly related to the absorption characteristics of the carbon additives. Importantly, it was found that the macroporous carbons with a pore size of similar to 65 nm effectively confined dissolved polysulfides. Interestingly, the sulfur cathodes with microporous carbon additives exhibited extremely similar electrochemical behavior to those with nonporous graphite, which suggests that activated carbon particles do not serve as polysulfide reservoirs during discharge.

However, the severe shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of polysulfides significantly hinder the practical application of LSBs. Most notably, surface defects of catalysts (typically anion deficiencies) have been fabricated via metal doping, hydrogen treatment and plasma engraving, in order to effectively enhance the chemisorption and electrocatalysis of polysulfides. However, these methods are complicated, have high costs and suffer from difficulties in scaling up. Herein, we present a facile and cost-effective strategy via electroreduction treatment to fabricate sulfur deficiencies applied to a CdS nanosheet/reduced graphene oxide (CdS NSs/rGO) composite, which serves as the functional separator to promote the catalytic interconversion of polysulfides for LSBs. The cell with the CdS1-x NSs/rGO functional separator not only exhibits a high initial rate performance of 1415.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, but it also delivers an excellent cycling stability with a decay rate of 0.066% after 1000 cycles at 1C. This work provides a new perspective on engineering sulfur deficiencies in energy storage systems through electrochemical technology.

The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the new cell configuration. Specifically, the PANI-GO membrane can not only effectively mitigate the diffusion of lithium polysulfides to the negative electrode by a chemical interaction between the imine group (-N=) of the quinoid ring and polysulfides, but also improve sulfur utilization due to its conductive networks.

Phthalocyanine catalyst-coated porous carbon spheres have been prepared as host materials for Li-S batteries. In a battery, a small amount of phthalocyanine catalysts is dissolved in the electrolyte, which ensures the continuous contact between the catalysts and the active substance during the whole electrochemical reaction process. For the sulfur-based cathode with poor electrical conductivity, the adsorption and catalytic capacity of the composite can improve the electrochemical performance significantly. Moreover, the theoretical calculation results are in agreement with the experimental results, showing that the presence of CoPcCl lowers the energy barrier for polysulfide conversion and Li2S nucleation, accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics.

A separator modified with various materials was proposed and demonstrated as an effective method to handle these obstacles. In this study, hollow spherical cerium oxide (CeO2) fabricated by a practical approach, spray granulation, served as the separator coating material. LSBs with this hollow spherical cerium oxide-coated separator presented excellent electrochemical performances compared with reference samples using a super P-coated separator or a routine separator. This CeO2 layer can not only block and absorb lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also facilitate the transportation of electrons and ions as an upper current collector as well as a catalyst. The initial discharge capacity of this CeO2-coated separator sample reaches 1004 mA h g(-1) at 1C (1675 mA h g(-1)) and the reversible capacity is maintained at 625 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles, implying an excellent capacity retention. The high rate discharge capacity at 2C is as high as 760 mA h g(-1), which demonstrates a promising rate performance. The elemental mappings of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as the testing results of cyclic voltammetry (CV), further confirm the function of this hollow spherical CeO2-coated separator.

Herein, a unique hierarchical porous graphitic carbon (HPGC) with outstanding textural characteristics is achieved by a special synergistic activation mechanism, in which the low-temperature molten state of polymorphisms can induce a high-rate liquid phase porous activation. HPGC with high specific surface area (SSA, similar to 2571 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume (PV, similar to 2.21 m(2); g(-1)) can be achieved, which also possesses the capability to tune textural characteristics (i.e., SSA, PV, pore size distribution, etc.) within a wide range. Furthermore, the pilotscale production of HPGC is accomplished, which shows similar textural characteristics to the lab-scale HPGC. Due to the unique structure of HPGC and the capability of the textural control, it can be applicable in a variety of energy storage, energy conversion, and catalysis applications. The applications of pilot-scale HPGC products in supercapacitors and lithium sulfur batteries are highlighted in this work. Furthermore, the synergistic activation strategy can be promoted to other alkali-based carbon activation routes, which can open up new possibilities for the activated carbon production and lead to more widespread industrialized applications of HPGC.

Insights into the Interconnection of the Electrodes and Electrolyte Species in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Using Spatially Resolved Operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and X-ray Fluorescence Mapping	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							HIGH-ENERGY DENSITY; SURFACE MODIFICATION; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; CONDUCTING POLYMER; IONIC-CONDUCTIVITY; CARBON; CATHODE; PERFORMANCE; DISSOLUTION; NITRATE	The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery chemistry has attracted great interest in the last decade because of its outstanding theoretical gravimetric energy density compared to the state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery technology. However, practically achieved energy density is still far below the theoretical value, even in small laboratory-scale batteries. The problems seen in laboratory-scale batteries will inevitably increase during scale-up to large application-format cells, as the electrolyte to active material (AM) ratio will need to be reduced in these cells to achieve high gravimetric energy density on cell-level basis. Our study shows the unique possibility of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping to visualize the spatial distribution of the AM inside operating Li-S batteries in all cell components [working electrode (WE), separator, and counter electrode (CE)]. Through a combination of operando XRF mapping and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we show that unless self-discharge is efficiently prevented, the AM can completely dissolve and distribute throughout the cell stack within a time frame of 2 h, causing poor capacity retention. Using a polysulfide diffusion barrier between the WE and the CE, we successfully suppress these processes and thereby establish a tool for examining the sealed cathode electrode compartment, enabling sophisticated studies for future optimization of the WE processes.

By graphene oxide (GO) etched with H2O2, holey graphene oxide was obtained, which is further reduced and compressed to form HGP as sulfur host. HGP can be utilized not only as a flexible framework to carry sulfur but also as a conductive skeleton for electron transport and capture polysulfides formed during the cycle. The large specific area and holey structures could further increase the sulfur content, and prevent the cathode material structure from collapsing due to the expansion of sulfur volume. The flexible LiS battery based on HGP/S electrodes exhibited an initial capacity of 1073.2 mAh g(-1) and retained discharge capacity of 681 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1C under continuous bending.

Here, the rGO content improved the electronic conductivity and acted as a buffer to accommodate volumetric expansion of sulfur together with CNTs. In this study, it was aimed to benefit from the synergistic effect of the hybrid structure of rGO and CNT, and to determine the effect of rGO and CNT ratio on the S/rGO/CNT cathode capacity. For this purpose, the free-standing, flexible and binder-less paper cathodes were rationally designed by using different rGO/CNT ratios via a vacuum filtration method. To characterize the fabricated S/rGO/CNT cathodes, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical performance tests were used. In the fabrication of S/rGO/CNT cathodes, the obtained results showed that the use of 2:1 rGO/CNT ratio exhibited more mesoporous, well-designed laminar structure and higher discharge capacity according to 1:1 and 1:2 rGO/CNT ratios. As a result, the most effective cathode was achieved at 0.1C after 300 cycles, exhibiting a 701 mA h g(-1) discharge capacity. According to the obtained results, the fabricated cathode structures could be promise as novel high-performance Li-S cathode materials with a facile method.

Nonetheless, it is not trivial to simultaneously achieve dendrite-free lithium metal anode and stable sulfur cathode for practical applications. To tackle this issue, we herein design an oxygen-functionalized mesoporous carbon nanofiber framework decorated with well-distributed nickel nanoparticles as bifunctional hosts for both electrodes. The combined theoretical and experimental results reveal that the regulated electric field stemming from the oxygenated and mesoporous structure can effectively facilitate the uniform nucleation and growth of dendrite-free Li metal in local nanofiber and whole electrode levels. Meanwhile, the strong affiliation of oxygenated groups to lithium polysulfides greatly alleviate the shuttle effect, leading to impressive cyclic stability. When coupling above optimal electrodes into a flexible Li-S full battery with an ultralow negative to positive capacity ratio of 2.0, the new battery presents remarkable electrochemical performance with a high rate capability of 882 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C and an extremely low capacity decay rate of 0.005% per cycle over 300 cycles. The stable electrochemical performance exhibited by a flexible Li-S battery under different mechanical deformations paves the way for future practical applications in flexible energy storage devices based on the bifunctional hosts.

As a consequence, the loss of active material and reactions at the surface of Li limit the practical applications of Li/S batteries. LiNO3 has been proposed as an electrolyte additive to reduce the shuttle reactions by aiding the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the Li metal, limiting polysulfide shuttling. However, LiNO3 is continuously consumed during cycling, especially at low current rates. Therefore, the Li/S battery cycle life is limited by the LiNO3 concentration in the electrolyte. In this work, an ionic liquid (IL) [N-methyl-(n-butyl)pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide] was used as an additive to enable longer cycle life of Li/S batteries. By tuning the IL concentration, an enhanced stability of the SEI and lower flammability of the solutions were demonstrated, that is, higher safety of the battery. The Li/S cell built with a high sulfur mass loading (4 mg cm(-2)) and containing the IL-based electrolyte demonstrated a stable capacity of 600 mAh g(-1) for more than double the number of cycles of a cell containing LiNO3 additive.

Here, we synthesized low-cost multi-heteroatom co-doped carbon from biowaste bagasse [N, S, and O co-doped carbon (NSOC-10)]. We also investigated the influence of heteroatom doping in the carbon matrix and its effect on the electrochemical properties when used in Li-ion and Li-S batteries. Interestingly, the NSOC-10 sample shows a capacity of 574 mAh g(-1) even after 1000 cycles, which is much higher than the theoretical capacity of a traditional graphite anode (372 mAh g(-1)), while undoped carbon degrades quickly (pristine bagasse) and displays only 26.6% capacity retention within 250 cycles. The excellent capacity retention of NSOC-10 could be attributed to a highly porous carbon matrix that tends to increase Li+ percolation, shorten the Li+ diffusion path, and boost the lithium-ion storage capability. Further, we studied the use of the heteroatom-doped NSOC-10 carbon matrix as a carbon host for the sulfur cathode in a Li-S battery. Indeed, the Li-S cell showed an initial capacity of 1200 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 79% by the end of 250 cycles and maintained high coulombic efficiency of >99%. This is attributed to the heteroatom (N, S, and O) doping in the activated carbon scaffold that resulted in better electrode wettability, high Li+ diffusion rate, and good electron conductivity of the carbon matrix, and this polar carbon adsorbs polar polysulfides through polar-polar interactions and maintains its capacity. Hence, the designed cost-effective co-doped NSOC-10 was identified to be a promising candidate as an anode material in LIBs and also as a potential sulfur host in Li-S batteries.

A Microstructurally Resolved Model for Li- S Batteries Assessing the Impact of the Cathode Design on the Discharge Performance	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; ENERGY-CONVERSION; GRAPHENE OXIDE; CELLS; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; ELECTROLYTES; INTERCALATION; CONDUCTIVITY	This paper reports a discharge model for lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery cells, supported by a multi-scale description of the composite C/S cathode microstructure. The cathode is assumed to be composed of mesoporous carbon particles with inter-particular pores in-between and the sulfur impregnated into both types of pores. The electrolyte solutes such as sulfur, polysulfides and lithium ions, produced during the discharge, are allowed to exchange between the pores. Furthermore, the model describes the Li2S(solid) precipitation and its effects on transport and reduction reaction kinetics. Hereby it provides fundamental insights on the impact on the Li-S discharge curve of practically modifiable manufacturing parameters and operation designs, such as current density, carbon porosity, C/S ratio and sizes of carbon particles and pores.

Although elemental sulfur was not detected in any of the sulfur/activated carbon composites based on Thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results confirmed its presence in the activated carbon. These results indicate that sulfur was successfully impregnated in the activated carbon and that all of the activated carbons acted as sulfur reservoirs. The sulfur/activated carbon composite cathode using coal exhibited the highest discharge capacity and best rate capability. The first discharge capacity at 1 C (1.672 Ag-1) was 1240 mAh g(-1), and a large reversible capacity of 567 mAhg(-1) was observed at 10 C (16.72 A g(-1)). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MnO2-Coated Sulfur-Filled Hollow Carbon Nanosphere-Based Cathode Materials for Enhancing Electrochemical Performance of Li-S Cells	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							HIGH-CAPACITY; POROUS CARBON; LITHIUM; BATTERIES; POROSITY; SPHERES; HOSTS	When comes to very high energy density energy storage systems, the prospect of lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) technology is very promising. The major problem that prevents the commercial production of LSBs is their poor cycling life caused by the migration of polysulfide intermediates from the cathode structure to the anode. Confining sulfur and the discharged polysulfide intermediates inside conductive porous carbon matrices is regarded as a promising and effective strategy to overcome this problem. In this study, a new class of MnO2-coated sulfur-filled hollow carbon nanosphere (HCN)-based cathode materials has been prepared to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S Cells. The cathode materials constructed with silica nanoparticle hard templates displayed a high initial capacity of 834 mAh g(-1) with a capacity fading rate of 0.080% per cycle. This material also showed superior redox kinetics, which enabled the Li-S cells to run at a higher charging-discharging current density. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

Among all the components of electric vehicles, the power battery is a decisive one that restricts the drive range and the large-scale application of electric vehicles. However, currently, the energy/power density and cycling lifespan of power batteries still need to be increased to fulfill the actual demands of electric vehicles. Then, it is essential for the feasible structural design and adjustable preparation of electrode materials with special microstructure and remarkable electrochemical properties. Carbon-based electrode play a key role in the next-generation high energy density, highly safe and long cycling lifespan power batteries because of their structural diversity, outstanding conductivity, controllable pore size, large specific surface area, facile surface modification and electrochemical stability. Therefore, carbon and its derived materials reveal satisfactory electrochemical performance as electrode materials for energy storage and conversion devices. In this review, the effects of diversity, microstructure characteristics, porosity, heteroatom doping of carbon materials in lithium ion battery, lithium sulfur battery, lithium-O-2 battery, lithium metal batteries, and fuel cell are comprehensively discussed.

However intrinsic large volume expansion and irreversible loss of activated materials seriously limit their commercial applications. To solve the problems, nitrogen-doped hierarchical carbon nanocages were synthesized and used as efficient sulfur hosts. The synthesized nitrogen doped hierarchically meso-microporous carbon (N-MMC) had large BET surface area and mesopore volumes, contributing to high sulfur loading and a reduced volume-change effect of sulfur during lithiation. Moreover, the strong physical adsorption in the micropores together with improved chemical adsorption caused by nitrogen doping lead to effective polysulfide trapping. The N-MMC/S exhibited high initial capacities of 1202.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and 1024 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C. The capacity kept at as high as 780 mA h g(-1) after 60 cycles at 0.2C and 623.8 mA h g(-1) after 70 cycles at 0.5C.

However, the performance of LSBs is severely hindered by the shuttle effect and the sluggish reaction kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Here, a Janus Fe3C/N-CNF@RGO electrode consisting of a 1D Fe3C-decorated N-doped carbon nanofibers (Fe3C/N-CNFs) side and a 2D reduced graphene oxide (RGO) side was applied as a free-standing carrier for the Li2S6 catholyte to improve the overall electrochemical performance of LSBs. The Fe3C/N-CNF layer endows the cathode with strong chemisorption abilities for LiPSs and accelerated the redox kinetics via catalyzing the conversion of LiPSs. The 2D RGO sheets serve as a microscopic physical barrier and further resist the shuttling of LiPSs. Like a hunter's trap, behind the trap lies a net. Moreover, the 3D hierarchical conductive network based on 1D N-CNF and 2D RGO sheets enables fast electron transfer. Based on the synergetic effects of chemical immobilization, catalytic abilities, and a physical barrier in a 3D conductive network, LSBs with optimal Fe3C/N-CNF@RGO electrodes exhibit robust long-term cycling stability (a decay rate of only 0.0089% per cycle at 0.5C for 300 cycles), superior rate capabilities (821.7 mA h g(-1) at 2.0C), and stable cycling performance at high sulfur loading (6.29 mg cm(-2)). This work defines an emerging viewpoint relating to the design of novel sulfur carriers with multiple synergistic effects for application in LSBs.

Using first-principles calculations, various vacancies, N doping, and B, N co-doping in graphene sheets have been systematically explored for lithium polysufides entrapped in Li-S batteries. The Li center dot center dot center dot S, Li center dot center dot center dot C, Li center dot center dot center dot N and S center dot center dot center dot B bonds and Hirshfeld charges in the Li2S6 adsorbed defective graphene systems have been analyzed to understand the intrinsic mechanism of retaining lithium polysulfides in these systems. Total and local densities of states analyses elucidate the strongest adsorption sites among the N and B-N co-doped graphene systems. The overall electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries varies with the types of defects in graphene. Among the defective graphene systems, only the reconstructed pyrrole-like vacancy is effective for retaining lithium polysulfides. N doping induces a strong Li...N interaction in the defective graphene systems, in which the pyrrolic N rather than the pyridinic N plays a dominant role in trapping of lithium polysulfides. The shuttle effect can be further depressed via pyrrolic B, N co-doped defective graphene materials, especially the G-B-N-hex system with extremely strong adsorption of lithium polysulfides (4-5 eV), and simultaneous contribution from the strong Li center dot center dot center dot N and S center dot center dot center dot B interactions.

In this paper, we report Na-X zeolite templated porous carbon (ZPC) filled with sulfur as a cathode material for Li-S batteries. To immobilize liquid Li sulfide, the surface of NCP was modified by amphiphilic N-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), making ZPC amphiphilic (denoted as A-ZPC). ZPC, A-ZPC and their corresponding composites with sulfur (ZPC-S and A-ZPC-S) were analyzed by various physical characterizations, charge-discharge profiling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed excellent performance of the A-ZPC-S composite cathode with 46 wt% sulfur loading, a specific capacity can be retained at 691 mA h g (1) even after 300 cycles under a rate of 1C, fading only 0.142% per cycle.

By taking advantages of the high conductivity and favorable catalytic activity of RuO2, we design a 3D carbon nanotube film with embedded RuO2 nanoparticles as a freestanding type of chemisorptive and catalyst-like cathode for Li-S batteries, which can be facilely prepared by a surfactant-assisted vacuum infiltration method. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal the excellent capability of RuO2 for anchoring polysulfides and accelerating the kinetics of polysulfides catalytic redox reactions. Besides, the 3D freestanding cathode is beneficial to overcoming pulverization during volume changes, especially for long-term cycling. At a high areal sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2), favorable initial capacities of 750 and 1060 mA h g(-1) respectively at 2 and 0.5 C are achieved. More attractively, the capacity after 1000 cycles maintains 405 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C with a loss in capacity of only 0.06% per cycle. Additionally, such freestanding cathode allows the batteries to be tested under various bending stages, hence encouraging more research works on fabrication of other 3D nanostructure families as high-performance cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Herein, a highly graphitic N-doped carbon matrix implanted by dual-role Fe and Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe/Fe3C@GNC) is designed to simultaneously tackle challenges existing in both cathode and anode. On the cathode, a Fe/Fe3C@GNC interlayer guaranteed excellent rate capability even at 55 degrees C (442 mA h g(-1)in 10C) featuring rapid Li(+)diffusivity, low barrier of Li2S decomposition, and improved electron/ion conductivity. On the anode, a thin layer of Fe/Fe3C@GNC with lithiophilic surface as an ideal Li host effectively suppressed the Li dendrite growth and regulated Li plating/stripping, thus leading to outstanding cycling stability even at a high current density of 5 mA cm(-2). On this basis, a brand-new Li-S full cell was constructed by simultaneously employing Fe/Fe3C@GNC as an interlayer sandwiched between the cathode and separator, as well as a lithium metal anode host. As a result, the as-prepared full cell demonstrates boosted performance of 598 mA h g(-1)at 2C.

Herein, we developed a simplequasi-click reaction to release sulfhydryl groups simultaneously viathiolactone and amino nucleophilic ring-opening, which was used to coatcarbon nanotubes as the cathode in Li-S batteries. Density functionaltheory (DFT) calculations and experiments both demonstrated that carbonnanotube supported sulfhydryl polymer (TLP@CNT) forms strong S-Scovalent bonds with sulfur and polysulfides through sulfur impregnation,resulting in effectively inhibiting the shuttle effect. Also, it is remarkablethat a stable cross-linked network serving as a physical barrier and chemicalabsorption deriving from abundant electron-rich donors (e.g.,-NH2,-CO(NH)-) in a TLP@CNT/S cathode can synergistically suppress theshuttle effect. Thus, the capacity retention of the TLP@CNT/S cell can reach up 80.88% with a small decay of 0.038% per cycle atthe current of 1 C even after 500 cycles. All these features demonstrate that sulfhydryl polymer prepared via a rapid and effectivenucleophilic ring-opening of thiolactones can emerge as a potential candidate as a sulfur cathode and may open a new route for thedesign of a superior sulfur cathode toward high-performance Li-S batteries.

When incorporated with a small amount of graphene (GN) and g-C3N4, the final products of C-NC/GN/g-C(3)N(4 )hybrids maintain the 3D interconnected network-like morphology assembled by 2D ultrathin graphene-like sheets. Meanwhile, the hybrids synergize the advantages of the graphene with high conductivity to facilitate fast electron transfer, the g-C3N4 with efficient chemical absorptivity for intermediate polysulfides to inhibit the unfavorable dissolution, as well as the 3D network frameworks of C-NC with high surface area and macro/mesoporous features to offer rapid ion diffusion channels and adequate electrolyte infiltration and mitigate the structural changes of S cathode during cycling. When loading with elemental S, the fabricated S@C-NC/GN/g-C3N4 cathode shows superior high-rate capability and remarkable cycling performance, which maintains a high reversible capacity of similar to 1130 mA h g(-1) after 500 consecutive electrochemical cycles. This renewable biomass-based cathode construction strategy offers a low-cost promising approach to design high-rate and ultralong-lifespan Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the inherent slow redox kinetics of sulfur leads to limited rate performance, low discharge capacity and rapid capacity fading. Herein, the Li1+xMn2O4 material produced by in-situ lithium intercalation of LiMn2O4 before 2.5 V is selected to improve the performances of Li-S batteries. First-principles calculations show that Li1+xMn2O4 can improve electronic conductivity and chemical adsorption. Electrochemical characterizations further confirm that lithiated material provides a fast conversion kinetics for LiPSs and a low barrier of lithium-ion diffusion. As a result, the Li-S battery incorporating Li1+xMn2O4 presents excellent rate performance with a discharge capacity as high as 915 mAh g(-1) at 2 C rate. At the same time, the battery maintains a high reversible capacity of 531 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1 C rate, and the average capacity loss per cycle is only 0.047%. This work can improve the redox kinetics of sulfur cathodes and provide a new path for the advancement of high-performance Li-S batteries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, the formation of surface-bound insoluble intermediates is further promoted by surface engineering of manganese oxide host via introducing oxygen vacancies. Hollow MnO2 nanospheres are first synthesized via a facial hard-template method, which provide a huge void for sulfur immobilization and volumetric expansion. Surface oxygen vacancies are then introduced by heating the products in a reduction atmosphere. These oxygen vacancies are proposed to accelerate the formation of polythionate intermediates, and which can adsorb polysulfides species more strongly than normal oxide sites and assist in their dissociation to lithium sulfide. The cathode based on oxygen-deficient manganese oxide hollow nano- spheres achieves high initial discharge capacity of 1053 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and high reversible capacity of 551 mAh g(-1) at 2 C over 400 cycles, while only initial discharge capacity of 918 mAh g(-1) and reversible capacity of 410 mAh g(-1) are obtained for pristine MnO2. This work provides a novel strategy to establish cathode with engineered surface chemistry of metal oxides for high performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, hierarchical MoC@Ni-NCNT arrays are reported as a multifunctional sulfur host in Li-S batteries, which comprised a flexible carbon fiber cloth substrate decorated with vertical MoC porous nanorods rooted by interconnected nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). In the designed host, the inner MoC porous backbone (composed of nanoparticles) along with the in situ-grafted interwoven NCNT shell can greatly maximize the host-guest interactive surface for homogeneous sulfur dispersion, thus realizing decent high-sulfur-loading performance. Ni nanoparticles, encapsulated within NCNTs in the outer shell, act as strong chemical-anchoring centers effectively trap-escaped polysulfides and propel the bidirectional sulfur transformation kinetics. In merit of sufficient adsorption and catalytic sites, the cell configured with the MoC@Ni-NCNT cathode delivers not only high capacity (1421 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C) but also superior rate performance and ultralong lifespan. The cell can still achieve a superb areal capacity of 6.1 mA h cm(2) under an increased sulfur loading up to 6 mg cm(-2).

Linking Solid Electrolyte Degradation to Charge Carrier Transport in the Thiophosphate-Based Composite Cathode toward Solid-State Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						composite cathodes; electrolyte degradation; ion transport; Li&#8208; S batteries; solid&#8208; state batteries; transmission line models		Solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (SSLSBs) have the potential to cause a paradigm shift in energy storage. The use of emerging highly-conductive solid electrolytes enables high energy and power densities. However, the need for an intimate mixture of electrolyte and conductive additives to compensate for the insulating nature of cathode active materials S-8 and Li2S induces intense electrolyte degradation. Thus, it is paramount to understand better the electrochemical and transport properties of the cathode composite with extremely high interface density among cathode components. Here, by utilizing a ball-milled composite of the lithium argyrodite Li6PS5Cl and carbon as a model electrode, the stability, reversibility, and transport in the composite as functions of cathode loading, the volume fraction of conducting phase, temperature, and applied potentials are comprehensively investigated. Comparing the onset potentials of electrolyte degradation and the sharp drop in the effective ionic conductivity of the composite determined through transmission-line model analysis, successful enhancement of the capacity retention of SSLSBs is demonstrated by balancing between the attainable capacity and effective carrier transport, achieving a high areal capacity of 3.68 mAh cm(-2) after 100 cycles at room temperature. The here-observed analysis is applicable to any solid-state composite with electrically insulating active materials.

However, it remains a great challenge to develop a universal method to prepare 2D mesoporous heterostructures. Herein, we report a composite-micelle-directed interfacial assembly method to synthesize heterostructures of an ultrathin 2D material covered with mesoporous monolayers assembled on both sides. To demonstrate the concept, we first fabricated a new sandwichlike carbon@MXene@carbon mesoporous heterostructure through the self-assembly of exfoliated MXene nanosheets and block copolymer F127/melamine-formaldehyde resin composite micelles and subsequent thermal treatment. Finally, we demonstrate that the carbon@MXene@carbon mesoporous heterostructured nanosheets manifest remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance as a cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries.

These unwanted reactions therefore lead to the fast failure of batteries. The preservation of the highly reactive lithium metal anode in sulfur-containing electrolytes has been one of the main challenges for Li-S batteries. In this study, we systematically controlled and optimized the formation of a smooth and uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer through electrochemical pretreatment of the Li metal anode under controlled current densities. A distinct improvement of battery performance in terms of specific capacity and power capability was achieved in charge-discharge cycling for Li-S cells with pretreated Li anodes compared to pristine untreated ones. Importantly, at a higher power density (1 C rate, 3 mA cm(-2)), the Li-S cells with pretreated Li anodes protected by a controlled elastomer (Li-Protected-by-Elastomer, LPE)) show the suppression of the Li dendrite growth and exhibit 3-4 times higher specific capacity than the untreated ones after 100 electrochemical cycles. The formation of such a controlled uniform SEI was confirmed, and its surface chemistry, morphology, and electrochemical properties were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, focused-ion beam cross sectioning, and scanning electron microscopy. Adequate pretreatment current density and time are critical in order to form a continuous and uniform SEI, along with good Li-ion transport property.

To deal with this issue, high capacity Lithium-Sulfur cathodes were prepared through sulfur impregnation of disordered micro-porous carbon powders that have high surface-area. By using microporous carbon as a matrix for sulfur cathodes and lithium nitrate as an additive to the electrolyte solution, that suppresses the shuttle phenomena in Li-sulfur batteries, we managed to achieve a reversible capacity of over 500 mAh/g for 1000 cycles with a Columbic efficiency approaching 100% throughout cycling. The influence of the volume of the electrolyte solutions in Li-S cells was further evaluated by analyzing their voltage profiles during cycling. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

However, the notorious "lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle" and sluggish kinetics in sulfur redox have posted great threat to their practical applications. Herein, we develop a VN-modified separator as an effective promoter to regulate the LiPSs and accelerate the electrochemical kinetics of Li-S batteries. Benefiting from the dense packing structure and polar surface of porous VN, the VN-modified separator favorably synergizes bifunctionality of physical confinement and chemical entrapment toward LiPSs while affording smooth lithium-ion migration. In addition, the superb electrical conductivity of VN also propels the LiPS conversion. With these advantages, thus-integrated batteries with VN-modified separator exhibit an average capacity decay of 0.077% per cycle at 1 C cycles. A reasonable areal capacity of 4.2 mAh cm(-2) is achieved even with a high sulfur mass loading of 3.8 mg cm(-2) at 0.2 C. The present work offers a rational strategy to regulate the LiPS behavior and guide the sulfur redox kinetics toward effective and long-life Li-S batteries.

Because PANi polymerization requires only the addition of sulfur powder, the polymerization method was simple. Battery performance testing was conducted using various sulfur ratios, with the best performance being exhibited by the 31 wt% sulfur PANi composite (approximately 500 mAh g(-1)S after 50 cycles from an initial capacity of 903 mAh g(-1)S). Transmission electron microscopy images confirmed that sulfur was coated by an approximately 10-nm-thick layer of PANi. Cycle testing was conducted at a rate of 0.2 C with an electrode loading of 2 mg cm(-2) of sulfur. Thus, a highly homogenous distribution of sulfur particles in PANi was achieved, resulting in sulfur-coated composite materials and allowing for the preparation of a conductive polymer by a relatively simple sulfur distribution method.

Carbon for Li-S Batteries under Wetting Conditions	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							X-RAY-SCATTERING; SMALL-ANGLE NEUTRON; POROUS CARBON; ORGANIC-SOLVENTS; PORE-SIZE; LITHIUM; ELECTROLYTES; WETTABILITY; PERFORMANCE; SOLUBILITY	One key aspect in the cathode chemistry of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries is the firm contact between elemental sulfur and the conducting carbon host to ensure the occurrence of the reduction reaction. In this respect, we study the retention of sulfur in the model cathode material CMK-8 carbon loaded by 20 and 50 wt % in the presence of solvents of different nature (D2O, d-THF, d-toluene) using small-angle neutron scattering. Exploiting the contrast matching between carbon and these liquids, the scattering of the sulfur phase is isolated and the amount and distribution of sulfur in the pores is determined in precise and direct fashion. The chord-length distribution (CLD) analysis shows that sulfur is preserved in both meso- and micropores if D2O is used. In the case of d-THF, sulfur is found in the micropores only, whereas complete removal from the pore network occurs for wetting with d-toluene. This severe loss in the presence of solvents similar to those used in Li-S batteries (e.g., dioxolane, diglyme) is ascribed to their superior adhesion on the carbon surface and, more importantly, indicates that only a little amount of loaded sulfur is available for the electrochemical reactions.

The MoS2@N-CNFs membrane is employed as a free-standing cathode for Li/polysulfides batteries. N-CNFs membrane with high electrical conductivity is used as a current collector to effectively reduce the internal resistance in the electrode and immobilize the dissolved lithium polysulfides with mesoporous N-CNFs with pyridine nitrogen. The MoS2 nanoflakes introduced into N-CNFs membrane offer a hierarchical composite structure, in which the MoS2 nanoflakes not only have chemical binding with the lithium polysulfides, but also promote fast redox reaction kinetics with high capacity and low voltage polarization. Meanwhile, the MoS2 nanoflakes have been demonstrated to show strong binding energy and be capable of anchoring polysulfides based on density functional theory calculations. As a result, with a high sulfur loading of 7.11 mg, the assembled cell with MoS2@N-CNFs thorn Li2S6 cathode demonstrates excellent electrochemical performances with a capacity decay rate of 0.08% per cycle over 250 cycles at 0.2C. Moreover, when the sulfur loading is further increased to 11.84 mg, a capacity decay rate of 0.25% per cycle over 100 cycles is achieved.

In this study, we deviate from the prevalent approach compositing sulfur with various carbonaceous materials by introducing electrocatalysis concept in lithium-sulfur chemistries. Two-dimensional graphene has been used as model system to support electrocatalyst Pt. Uniform dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on graphene layers not only demonstrate to preferential adsorption of soluble polysulfide species, but also catalyze efficiently transformation to long-chain polysulfides in the subsequent redox process. The result rGO-Pt/S composite shows a 29.5% enhancement in capacity over pristine rGO/S electrode. More impressively, rGO-Pt/S electrode exhibits good cycling stability at a high rate of 2 C corresponding to a tiny capacity fading rate of 0.01% per cycle over 300 discharge/charge cycles. Thus, this work provides a facile strategy for improving the performance of Li-S batteries toward practical application.

A 0.5 nm thick layer of Al2O3 is conformally coated onto highly porous carbon cloth by ALD, and then assembled in a Li-S battery between the sulfur cathode and the anode side (separator and Li anode) to function as a reactivation component. Compared to half cells with no ALD treatment, the ultrathin Al2O3 coating increases the specific discharge capacity by 25% from 907 to 1136 mA h/g at the 1st cycle, and by 114% from 358 to 766 mA h/g at the 40th cycle. Thus the ALD-Al2O3 improves the initial specific capacity and stabilizes the cycle life remarkably. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results indicate that the ALD-Al2O3 coated carbon cloth sorbs (adsorbs/absorbs) more dissolved sulfur species from the electrolyte. Potential mechanisms for the improved sorption properties are proposed. The combination of an ultrathin ALD-oxide coating with highly porous carbons presents a new strategy to improve the performance of Li-S batteries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The PUVGCF structure is formed via peeling and further lengthwise cutting with highly graphitized vapor-grown carbon fibers (VGCF) using a simple solution-based oxidative process. The composites of PUVGCF/S wrapped with polyaniline (PANi) are synthesized via an in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline using a liquid process. The microsphere structure not only shortens the electron and ion transport pathway but also provides mechanical support to accommodate volume expansion during the discharge/charge process. Additionally, the PANi coating layer further enhances conductivity of the electrode and prevents the polysulfides from dissolving in the electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate excellent performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, novel binder-free Ni@N-doped carbon nanospheres (N-CNSs) films as sulfur host are firstly synthesized via a facile combined hydrothermal-atomic layer deposition method. The cross-linked multilayer N-CNSs films can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity of electrode and provide physical blocking "dams" toward the soluble long-chain polysulfides. Moreover, the doped N heteroatoms and superficial NiO layer on Ni layer can work synergistically to suppress the shuttle of lithium polysulfides by effective chemical interaction/adsorption. In virtue of the unique composite architecture and reinforced dual physical and chemical adsorption to the soluble polysulfides, the obtained Ni@N-CNSs/S electrode is demonstrated with enhanced rate performance (816 mAh g(-1) at 2 C) and excellent long cycling life (87% after 200 cycles at 0.1 C), much better than N-CNSs/S electrode and other carbon/S counterparts. Our proposed design strategy offers a promising prospect for construction of advanced sulfur cathodes for applications in LSBs and other energy storage systems.

But it is few reported that the atom intercalation can enable the TMDs have unexpected catalytic properties, caused by the unit-cell deformation in them. In this work, a type of V-0.25-intercalated VS2 (V5S8) nanoflakes was designed via a direct vulcanization method combining Kirkendall heat diffusion effect, and used as the promotor for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). The V5S8 possesses a NiAs crystal structure, in which V atoms occupy the interlayer spacing between VS2 monolayers, which will unavoidably cause the unit cell deformation. As expected, the CNF@V5S8 /S cathodes show a specific capacity of 1260 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, and can keep 73.65% of the capacity with charge/discharge rate increasing 10 times; while the CNF@VS2/S ones can only retain 54.0% of the initial capacity. Moreover, the CNF@V5S8/S cathodes show an ultralow decay rate of only 0.0312% per cycle for 1500 cycles at 5 C. Furthermore, the catalysis effect of V5S8 on the conversion of lithium polysulfide (Li2Sn, n = 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8) and S-8 clusters were systematically discusses. Besides, the V5S8 can further enable LSBs achieve a high areal capacity (8.2 mAh cm(-2) with sulfur loading of 7.8 mg cm(-2)) and a high dynamic flexible stability at bending angle between 0 and 180 degrees.

The deposition of insulating Li2S1-2 on the surfaces of S based cathodes (e.g., S and Li2S) limits the reaction kinetics, leading to inferior electrochemical performance. In this work, the impact of binders on the deposition of Li2S1-2 on S based cathodes is revealed, along with the interaction between polyvinylidene difluoride and Li2S/polysulfides. This interaction can obstruct the electrochemical reactions near the binder, leading to dense deposition of insulating Li2S1-2 that covers the cathode surface. Without such a binder, localized and uniform Li2S1-2 deposition throughout the whole cathode can be achieved, effectively avoiding surface blockage and significantly improving electrode utilization. A full battery constructed with a binder-free Li2S cathode delivers a gravimetric and volumetric energy density of 331.0 Wh kg(-1) and 281.5 Wh L-1, under ultrahigh Li2S loading (16.2 mg(Li2S) cm(-2)) with lean electrolyte (2.0 mu L mg(Li2S)(-1)), providing a facile but practical approach to the design of next-generation S-based batteries.

Herein, N, F, and B co-doped NFBCoFe2O4-x on multiwalled carbon nanotubes' (MWCNTs) (NFBCoFe2O4-x@MWCNTs) composite material with enriched oxygen vacancies (OVs) introduced by ionic liquids (ILs) does not only exhibit enhanced polysulfides trapping ability but also effectively accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides. A commercial Celgard polypropylene (PP) 2400 separator with NFBCoFe2O4-x@MWCNTs coating layer is fabricated as a multifunctional barrier for Li-S batteries. As a result, the battery based on the NFBCoFe2O4-x@MWCNTs separator demonstrates a stable electrochemical performance. Even under a high S loading of 8.0 mg cm(-2), a desirable areal capacity of 4.62 mAh cm(-2) can still be maintained over 200 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C. The prospective strategy of engineering OVs introduced by ILs provides novel insights into the development of Li-S batteries.

Effect of fibrous separators on the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; ENHANCED ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; ENERGY-STORAGE; CARBON; MEMBRANE; CAPACITY; CATHODE; SALT	In this paper we systematically investigated effect of separator morphology on the performance of Li-S batteries. We tested two kinds of commercially available non-woven fibrous separators made of polypropylene in conjunction with trilayer PP/PE/PP porous separator. Among the non-woven separators, the fibers of the separator of first kind are rough and more acidic than the fibers of the separator of second art, which are smooth. It was found that batteries with smooth separator demonstrate higher Coulombic efficiency, higher charging/discharging capacity and better cycling stability. We attribute better performance of batteries with smooth fibers of separators to lower acidity than that of rough fibers. We believe that negatively charged polysulfides are unable to adsorb on more acidic rough fibers and diffuse readily to lithium electrode. In contrast, polysulfides are able to adsorb on the surface of less acidic smooth fibers that reduces their polysulfides shuttle and rapid decay of battery capacity. Strategic deployment of non-woven Freudenberg and Celgard separator in combination leads to high active mass utilization, superior wettability, reduced short circuit tendency caused by dendritic growth and slower capacity decay.

Soluble long-chain polysulfide species (Li2Sx, 4 <= x <= 8) would continue to dissolve and migrate to the negative side to react with metallic Li. Here, we demonstrate pronounced suppression of polysulfide shuttle using an ionic liquid of the N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (PP13TFSI)-based electrolyte. When working in combination with LiNO3, zero self-discharge can be achieved to rest a full-charged Li-S cell for two days. The fascinating study clearly demonstrates that a promising practical Li-S battery with low self-discharge depends on both improvements on polysulfide diffusion control and Li-metal stabilization.

However, due to the limitation of its chemistry, the energy density of Li-ion batteries is limited to similar to 300 W h kg(-1). In recent years, more attention has been paid to the Li-S batteries that are environmentally friendly, cost-effective and high energy density (theoretical value of cathode: similar to 2600 W h kg(-1)). In this study, carbonized polydopamine (C-PDA)-coated hollow carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with TiO2 nanoparticles interspersed in the void space between the CNF skeleton and carbon coating layer were subtly designed. The C-PDA/TiO2/CNF composite (CTC) was integrated with the commercial separator as a polysulfide filter to achieve high-performance Li-S batteries. It is reveals that the CTC coating layer could effectively filter and reactivate the dissolved polysulfides to achieve a stabilized sulfur-based cathode. The Li-S battery assembled by this integrated separator and the regular cathode (sulfur/Ketjen black) with 72.7 wt% of sulfur achieved a high specific capacity and low decay rate (632.5 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle and 0.06% per cycle) at 2.0C for 500 cycles. These good results indicate that the C-PDA/TiO2/CNF-modified separator could be a promising separator candidate for high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Taking full advantage of interactions between polysulfides and functional groups of third-party additives has been proven to be an efficient strategy. In the present work, we selected DNA to decorate CMK-3/S cathodes. The -P=O and =N-sites of the constituent deoxyribonucleotides of DNA are demonstrated to be capable of anchoring polysulfides through our DFT calculations. The experimental results show that adding a small amount of DNA into the CMK-3/S composite significantly improved the cyclic performance. In particular, with a moderate DNA loading rate, the DNA post-loading procedure resulted in a discharge capacity of 771 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C after 200 cycles (70.7% retention of the initial), which yielded slightly improved performance as compared to the DNA pre-loading procedure. The proposed DNA decorating scheme may provide an applicable technical solution for developing high-performance Li/S batteries.

Most research in LSBs has been focused on the sulfur cathode design, although the performance is also known to be sensitive to other parameters such as binder, current collector, separator, lithium anode, and electrolyte. Here, an integrated LSB system based on the understanding of the different roles of binder, current collector, and separator is developed. By using the cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose-citric acid (CMC-CA) binder, Toray carbon paper current collector, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coated separator, LSBs achieve a high capacity of 960 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles (2.5 mg cm(-2)) and 930 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles (5 mg cm(-2)) at 0.1 C. Moreover, the failure mechanism at a high sulfur loading with characteristics of fast capacity decay and infinite charging is discussed.

A new assembly for Li-S cells was developed by introducing multi-layer membranes as separators. The use of the multi-layer membranes enables the minimization of the shuttle effect by expanding the distance between the separators and blocking the penetration of the polysulfide. The best discharge capacity and cycle life were obtained with ten layers of PP membrane in a sulfur-CDC@1200 composite cathode, resulting in a discharge capacity of 670 mA h g(-1) and a minimal gap in the charge-discharge capacity during cell cycling.

NCA material with nanospheres presents the characteristics of large specific surface area and high loading sulfur owing to the specific cross-linked framework structure. In addition, the NCA/S cathode with high content of nitrogen can achieve strong adsorption to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) due to its inherent N active sites, and presents outstanding electrochemical performance. In details, the designed NCA/S electrode demonstrates the first discharge capacity of 1247 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. Moreover, the NCA/S battery also displays excellent electrochemical stability with low capacity attenuation rate of 0.083 % per cycle within 300 cycles at 0.5 C. The remarkable electrochemical properties are mainly ascribed to intense adsorption of evenly-distributed nitrogen in the carbon material, effectively preventing polysulfide (PS) escaping from host material, restraining shuttle effect and increasing sulfur utilization.

Herein, we report a novel composite material (labeled as Co-CMP-MWNTs) that consists of a CMP containing Co single-atom catalysts (Co SACs) and being coaxially grafted to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and show that the material synergistically promotes the cathode reaction kinetics in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The Co-CMPMWNTs are synthesized by coupling 2,4,6-tris(4-ethynylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine to a dibromobipyridine-Co complex in the presence of bromopyrimidinyl-functionalized MWNTs. The composite features a conductive MWNT-based core and a CMP-based shell that contains nitrogen as well as Co. Cs-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy reveal that the Co species exist as single atoms. Additional XANES data coupled with density functional theory calculations elucidate the adsorption interactions formed between the Co SACs and various sulfur species as well as their electrocatalytic effects. Li-S cells prepared using Co-CMP-MWNTs as a cathode host material exhibit excellent performance in terms of specific capacity (1485 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C), rate capability (602 mA h g-1 at 3 C), and cycling stability (510 mA h g(-1 )at 0.5 C after 1000 cycles, which corresponds to a capacity decay of 0.050% per cycle). Collectively, the results demonstrate that SACs can be prepared under benign conditions and used to enhance sulfur cathode reaction kinetics. The methodology described may be extended to enable the use of SACs in other contemporary energy conversion technologies.

The TMC host, synthesized by a simple sol-gel templating method, possesses one of the highest surface area of 2371 m(2) g(-1), pore volume of 2.85 cc g(-1) and a unique tri-modal mesopore structure (2.5 nm/9 nm/15 nm). Electrochemical tests reveal that the TMC/S-50 wt% nanocomposite cathode delivers an initial capacity up to 1029 mAh g(-1) at 3350 mA g(-1) (2C), and maintains a high reversible capacity of 843 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. And it retains a stable capacity of 708 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 5025 mA g(-1) (charge/discharge in 20 min, 3C). Even with a higher sulfur loading, the TMC/S-70 wt% nanocomposite still reaches a reversible capacity of 700 mAh g(-1), and demonstrates a very low decay rate of only 0.088% per cycle over 300 cycles at 838 mA g(-1) (0.5C). We attribute such superior performance to the collective effect of tri-modal mesopore architecture, especially to the contribution of the exterior large mesopores (15 nm), designed being not only large enough to accommodate rapid electrolyte transport, moreover, small enough to serve as additional buffer spaces for polysulfides entrapment.

Lithium-Sulfur Battery Cathode Enabled by Lithium-Nitrile Interaction	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							HIGH-CAPACITY; GRAPHENE OXIDE; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; CYCLE; PARTICLES; NANOTUBES	Lithium sulfide is a promising cathode material for high-energy lithium ion batteries because, unlike elemental sulfur, it obviates the need for metallic lithium anodes. Like elemental sulfur, however, a successful lithium sulfide cathode requires an inherent mechanism for preventing lithium polysulfide dissolution and shuttling during electrochemical cycling. A new scheme is proposed to create composites based on lithium sulfide uniformly dispersed in a carbon host, which serve to sequester polysulfides. The synthesis methodology makes use of interactions between lithium ions in solution and nitrile groups uniformly distributed along the chain backbone of a polymer precursor (e.g., polyacrylonitrile), to control the distribution of lithium sulfide in the host material. The Li2S-carbon composites obtained by carbonizing the precursor are evaluated as cathode materials in a half-cell lithium battery, and are shown to yield high galvanic charge/discharge capacities and excellent Coulombic efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of the architecture in homogeneously distributing Li2S and in sequestering lithium polysulfides.

Co3O4 nanoneedle arrays as a multifunctional "super-reservoir" electrode for long cycle life Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; GRAPHENE OXIDE; POROUS CARBON; ENCAPSULATED SULFUR; CATHODE MATERIAL; NANOWIRE ARRAYS; COMPOSITE; POLYSULFIDES; POLYHEDRA; CAPACITY	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are highly attractive as energy storage devices due to their low cost and high energy density. The undesired capacity degradation caused by the polysulfide shuttle, however, has hindered their commercialization. Herein, a Co3O4 nanoneedle array on carbon cloth (CC@Co3O4) nanocomposite has been prepared and demonstrated for the first time as a multifunctional "super-reservoir" electrode to prolong the cycle life of Li-S batteries. Owing to the polar surface of the Co3O4 nanoneedle array, soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 < n < 8) can be effectively absorbed and then transformed to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S which evenly covers the surface of the Co3O4 nanoneedle during the discharge process. Further, during the charge process, the Co3O4 nanoneedle can catalyze the electrochemical transformation of Li2S2/Li2S into soluble polysulfides. A high initial capacity of 1231 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C and a slow capacity decay of 0.049%/cycle at 2.0C over 500 cycles were achieved; excellent rate performance was also obtained.

J	Son, BD; Cho, SH; Bae, KY; Kim, BH; Yoon, WY				Son, Byung Dae; Cho, Sung Ho; Bae, Ki Yoon; Kim, Byung Hyuk; Yoon, Woo Young			Dual functional effect of the ferroelectricity embedded interlayer in lithium sulfur battery	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium ion battery; Sulfur cathode; Interlayer; Ferroelectricity; Barium titanate; Electrochemistry	CARBON NANOFIBER; CATHODE MATERIAL; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; CORE; SEPARATOR; SHUTTLE; SPHERES	A carbon nanotube sheet having homogeneously distributed BaTiO3 is applied to the Li-S cell system as a pseudo current collector between the cathode and separator. This interlayer serves as a site distributor, where poly sulfide eluted from the cathode continuously reacts, and it is expected to play a role as a more effective current collector by mixing the ferroelectric material. A cell utilizing a ferroelectricity embedded interlayer exhibits a higher capacity (908 mAh g(-1)) at 0.2C than that of carbon alone (740 mAh g(-1)) at 200th cycle. This result corresponds to a capacity retention ratio enhancement from 67.5% to 75.6%. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the retention of the coulombic efficiency is effectively maintained in long cycles at 0.5C (94.5%-99.6%). This is not only because the modified interlayer functions as an effective current collector owing to the high affinity of the ferroelectric material to polysulfide, but also because ferroelectricity in the interlayer acts as a polysulfide anchor. The evenly distributed polarization leads to a uniform deposition of sulfur, which results in the prevention of inactive sulfur agglomeration and dissolution of polysulfide. Thus, the utilization of active material can be improved with stabilized reaction.

Three kinds of PAN-S-KS6 composites with KS6 content of 5%, 10% and 20% are prepared by spray drying method. Than, the structure and electrochemical performance of the electrode are characterized, and the influence of different conductive content in the composite on the electrochemical performance of the composite electrode is also investigated by assembling lithium sulfur battery(Li-S battery). The results indicate that the ternary compounds with 10% KS6, 40% PAN and 50% elemental sulfur shows excellent electrochemical performance. The reason is that in PAN-S-KS6 composite, the appropriate amount of conductive agent provides good electron transport for the composite. Sufficient amount of PAN polymer can realize sulfur immobilization by complete bond of elemental sulfur, and form a complete conductive network on the surface layer of sulfur carbon composite, and the electrochemical performance of PAN-S composite electrode materials can be significantly improved.

Conductive carbon materials with heteroatom doping and rich porosity is the most common strategy for the effective prevention of polysulfide shuttle, but are usually obtained with high costs and tedious procedures. Herein, we managed to obtain highly porous N, S-codoped carbon materials (NS-C) through treating waste plastic of polyvinylchloride (PVC) with KOH. The resulting NS-C was revealed to be highly efficient hosts for sulfur cathode, achieving large reversible capacities of 1205 mA h g(-1) and 836 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and 1.0C, respectively, and remaining at 550 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C rate, showing an outstanding cycling stability. The significantly enhanced cycling performance was mainly ascribed to both the hierarchically porous structure and heavy N, S co-dopants, which respectively provided physical blocks and chemical affinity for the efficient immobilization of intermediate lithium polysulfides. The results provide an effective paradigm in the surface chemistry and sulfur cathode materials design for high-performance Li-S batteries and a new application for recycled plastic waste.

The use of conductive polymers to enhance the performance of Li-S batteries has received much attention. In this work, a convenient and low-cost in-cell electropolymerization method is developed for the preparation of a conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), as a cathode binder inside a Li-S battery. The cell with this electropolymerized PEDOT (ePEDOT) shows notably improved specific capacity, cycling stability, and rate performance in comparison with the cell using the chemically synthesized commercial PEDOT:PSS (cPEDOT:PSS) as the binder. The performance enhancement is attributed to the formation of tightly integrated interfaces between ePEDOT and other components in the sulfur cathode. Moreover, this study revealed that the electrochemical dedoping of PEDOT is likely to occur during the Li-S battery cycling and thus the contribution of PEDOT (and some other conductive polymers) to the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of the sulfur cathode may not be as significant as expected.

In the hybrid structure, the conductive, porous RGO skeleton functions as 3D electron channels and polysulfide reservoirs, effectively localizing the diffusing polysulfides. Meanwhile, the sulfiphilic VS4 nanoparticles grown in situ in the 3D matrix act as a polysulfide mediator to offer sufficient polysulfide-anchoring and catalytic sites. The polysulfide adsorptivity and redox-conversion reversibility are substantially improved, as validated by first-principles calculations and in-situ XRD analysis. As a result, the Li-S cells achieve a low capacity-fading rate of 0.07% per cycle after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled Li-S pouch cells with 200 mg of sulfur mass also deliver a high reversible discharge capacity of 730 mA h g(-1) (146 mA h) after 50 cycles.

We proposed this novel gas-phase loading method by using a specially designed fluid-bed reactor to encapsulate and sequester gas-phase sulfur molecules into the porous carbon in current study. The nitrogen Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterizations were investigated on both the porous carbon and the sulfur/carbon composite. The results show that the gas-phase loading method contributes to the combination of sulfur molecules and matrix porous carbon. Furthermore, the sulfur/multiple pore size distribution carbon composite based on the gas-phase loading method demonstrate an excellent electrochemical property. The initial specific discharge capacity is 795.0 mAh g(-1) at 800 mA g(-1), with a capacity retention of 86.3% after 100 cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Further development of the Li-S battery, however, is still impeded by capacity decay and kinetic sluggishness caused by the polysulfide shuttle and electrode/electrolyte interface issues. Herein, a new type of metal-organic-framework-derived sulfur host containing cobalt and N-doped graphitic carbon (Co-N-GC) was synthesized and reported, in which the catalyzing for S redox, entrapping of polysulfides and an ideal electronic matrix were successfully achieved synchronously, leading to a significant improvement in the Li-S performance. The large surface area and uniform dispersion of cobalt nanoparticles within the N-doped graphitic carbon matrix contributed to a distinct enhancement in the specific capacity, rate performance and cycle stability for Li-S batteries. As a result of this multi-functional arrangement, cathodes with a high sulfur loading of 70 wt% could operate at 1C for over 500 cycles with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency and exhibited an outstanding high-rate response of up to 5C, suggesting that the S@Co-N-GC electrode was markedly improved by the proposed strategy, demonstrating its great potential for use in low-cost and high-energy Li-S batteries.

However, increasing the sulfur loading and restraining the polysulfide shuttle effect are the primary issues to be solved. Herein, a novel N, Ni-decorating amylum scaffold was fabricated by carbonizing amylum with urea and NiCl center dot 6H(2)O (AC/Ni/N) at 1000 degrees C under Ar atmosphere. The AC/Ni/N scaffold was used to modify the separator as an effective polysulfide trapper for LSBs. This AC/Ni/N-modified separator not only exhibits a high polysulfide confinement, but provides abundant conductive pathways to permit the fast diffusion of the Li+ ions and electrons. Importantly, the synergistic catalysis of the Ni nanoparticles and N atoms plays a key role in improving the reaction kinetics of LSBs. Consequently, the LSBs with AC/Ni/N-modified separators delivered a superior rate performance and ultra-long cycling life with a very low decay rate of 0.043% per cycle at 4C. Moreover, the cathode, with a high sulfur loading at 7 mg cm(-2) and low electrolyte environment at 7.8 mu L mg(-1), delivered a high discharge capacity of 714 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles.

When used as electrode materials for LIB and Li-S battery, the obtained nanohybrid exhibits excellent lithium storage properties and a distinctly better cycling performance. A discharge capacity of 560 mA h g(-1) is obtained after 400 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1) for LIB. Furthermore, for Li-S battery, the obtained Co9S8/carbon hybrid used as sulfur host gave a reversible discharge capacity of ca. 880 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C (837.5 mA g(-1)), corresponding to 87% retention of its initial discharge capacity.

And the electrochemical performance and safety for Li-S cells with the MOFs modified gel PMIA nanofiber separators were systematically researched. Under the synergistic role of F-doped emulsion and MOFs nanoparticles, the modified PMIA-based membranes can produce relatively high porosity, reduced aperture and good electrolyte uptake. And the merits endow the separator with prominent thermal stability, mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, which lays a solid footing stone for high-performance and advanced-safety Li-S battery with fast ion transportation, reduced polarization, good interfacial compatibility and strong catalysis. The batteries with ZIF-67 and Cu-BTC (HKUST-1) modified membranes exhibited high first-cycle discharge capacity of 1267.5 and 1272.2 mAh g(-1), outstanding discharge capacity retention of 698.1 and 752.6 mAh g(-1) and super-high Coulombic efficiency of 99.75% and 99.82% after 500 cycles at 0.5 degrees C rate, respectively. The outstanding electrochemical properties and safety for the batteries assembled were ascribed to the greatly prevented "shuttle effect" of dissolved lithium polysulfides based on the physical capturing of high-order lithium polysulfides via the prepared jelly-like gel state and strongly chemical adsorbing to lithium polysulfides, and fast redox kinetics based on the strong catalytic conversion. This work proves that the addition of functional MOFs nanoparticles similar with ZIF-67 and Cu-BTC (HKUST-1) in gel F-doped PMIA membrane can inhibit the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides and reduce the growth of lithium dendrites to some extent, which will prompt a great development of Li-S battery with high performance and reassuring safety.

Shuttling effects caused by LiPS dissolution can lead to reduced performance and cycle life. Although carbon materials rely on physical trapping of polysulfides, polar oxide surfaces can chemically bind LiPS to improve the stability of sulfur cathodes. We show a simple synthetic method that allows high sulfur loading into mesoporous carbon preloaded with spatially localized nanoparticles of several Magneli-phase titanium oxide (TinO2n-1). This material simultaneously suppresses polysulfide shuttling phenomena by chemically binding Li polysulfides onto several Magneli-phase surfaces in a single cathode and ensures physical confinement of sulfur and LiPS. The synergy between chemical immobilization of significant quantities of LiPS at the surface of several TinO2n-1 phases and physical entrapment results in coulombically efficient high-rate cathodes with long cycle life and high capacity. These cathodes function efficiently at low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratios to provide high gravimetric and volumetric capacities in comparison with their highly porous carbon counterparts. Assembled coin cells have an initial discharge capacity of 1100 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and maintain a reversible capacity of 520 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C for more than 500 cycles. Even at 1C, the cell loses only 0.06% per cycle for 1000 cycles with a coulombic efficiency close to 99%.

However, a sulfur positive electrode has some crucial problems for practical use, which are mainly attributed to the dissolution of its intermediate products in charge-discharge processes. In order to resolve the dissolution problem of lithium polysulfide, we attempted to synthesize a sulfur-microporous activated carbon (AC) composite positive electrode. Moreover, we have systematically researched the battery performance of sulfur-microporous AC positive electrode with variations of electrolytes as well as negative electrodes, and found its promising positive electrode performance for a next generation rechargeable battery.

To overcome the shuttle effect, we developed here an ultrastable Li-S battery with amorphous Al2O3 nanohybrid separator for the first time. Through molecular design of the ligands, the material of the separator from carbonized MOF-Al at elevated temperature is composed of amorphous Al2O3 and N-doped porous carbon, which shows higher electrical conductivity, faster lithium diffusion and charge transfer capability, and stronger interaction with lithium polysulfides through the synergistic effect (MOF, metal-organic framework). The fabricated Li-S battery proposed here corresponds to the lowest capacity decay (only 0.054% of capacity decay in each cycle) as far as we know, which may open up new avenues for developing the next-generation lithium-ion battery.

However, nanostructured carbon materials, generally synthesized by liquid solution processes, have disadvantages of low electrical conductivity as sulfur host materials. In this study, highly porous hollow carbon-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite microspheres, with a high loading rate of ultrafine S and high electrical conductivity, are designed and successfully synthesized by an aerosol-assisted process (ultrasonic spray pyrolysis) as efficient sulfur host materials. The carbon-CNTs composite microspheres, with a high sulfur loading rate of 70 wt%, exhibit superior electrochemical performance as a cathode compared to that of S-loaded CNTs balls for Li-S batteries. The S-loaded carbon-CNTs composite microspheres exhibit a discharge capacity of 697 mA h g(-1 )for the 250th cycle at a current density of 1.0C and show high reversible discharge capacities of 685 mA h g(-1), even at a high current density of 3.0C. The outstanding cycling and rate performance of S-loaded carbon-CNTs composite microspheres are attributed to the structural flexibility of the hollow structure, loading of ultrafine sulfur in micro- and mesopores of dextrin-derived carbon, and good electrical conductivity due to uniformly dispersed CNTs.

For the first time, we report on insight into the immobilizing nature for soluble lithium polysulfides (LPS) based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived porous TiO2-S cathodes for LSB. The LSB based on hierarchically porous TiO2-S cathode displays greatly enhanced rate capability with superior specific capacity and coulombic efficiency. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for fresh and cycled cells indicates that the charge transfer kinetics of the TiO2-S cathode can be obviously enhanced, and the diffusion coefficient of Li-ions greatly increases due to the Ti-S chemical bonding during charge/discharge process, almost 17 times higher than that of fresh TiO2-S hybrid cathode. The charge resistance and diffusion coefficient can be comparable to that of previously reported carbon/sulfur cathode. It is revealed that dissolution of lithium ploysulfides, deposition of Li2S/Li2S2 and shuttle effect can be greatly mitigated due to the chemical immobilization effect from Ti-S chemical bonding. Furthermore, the porous structures of MOFs-derived TiO2 effectively alleviate the volume change, shortens the diffusion path of Li+. The present work provides a hint to design rational cathodes for high performance LSB. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, other modification methods also have an impact on the stability of the modified layer and the enhancement of electrochemical performance. Herein, we first design a novel bifunctional separator combined with one self-assembled FeOOH layer via a chemical way and one conductive g-C3N4/KB layer by physical coating. Different from directly coating the metal oxide and carbon composite on the separator, the self-assembled FeOOH layer is firmly formed on the PP separator, which enables the chemical capture of the soluble polysulfide and prohibit the shuttling effect. Then, the coated g-C3N4/KB layer is further introduced to greatly enhance the transportation of lithium ions and physically confine the migration of intermediates. As a result, the battery with this bifunctional separator (G-SFO) achieves outstanding rate capacities (1000, 901, and 802 mA h/g at 0.5, 1, and 2 C). After 900 cycles at 1 C, it also shows excellent long cycle performance, with relatively low fading (0.055%). This original fabrication will present a new and feasible strategy for fabricating a bifunctional separator with metal oxide and carbon material.

In pursuit of a practically viable high performance Li-S battery, a separator configuration (CoS2/HPGC/interlayer) as efficient polysulfide trapping barrier is reported. This configuration endows great advantages, particularly enhanced conductivity, promoted polysulfide trapping capability, accelerated sulfur electrochemistry, when using the functional interlayer for Li-S cells. Attributed to the above merits, such cell shows excellent cyclability, with a capacity of 846 mAh g(-1)after 250 cycles corresponding to a high capacity retention of 80.2% at 0.2 C, and 519 mAh g(-1)after 500 cycles at 1C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)). In addition, the optimized separator exhibits a high initial areal capacity of 4.293 mAh cm(-2)at 0.1C. Moreover, with CoS2/HPGC/interlayer, the sulfur cell enables a low self-discharge rate with a very high capacity retention of 97.1%. This work presents a structural engineering of the separator toward suppressing the dissolution of soluble Li2Sn moieties and simultaneously promoting the sulfur conversion kinetics, thus achieving durable and high capacity Li-S batteries.

To promote a better understanding of the correlation between the total pore volume of disordered mesoporous carbon and the cycling performance of Li-S batteries, a series of disordered mesoporous carbons with different total pore volumes are successfully synthesized using a commercial silica template. Based on the electrochemical and structural analyses, we suggest that the total pore volume of disordered mesoporous carbon is a predominant factor in determining its capability for either the absorption or adsorption of Li-polysulfides, which is primarily responsible for enhancing the cycling performance. The addition of disordered mesoporous carbon is also effective in enhancing the homogeneous distribution of active sulfur in the cathode, thereby affecting the cycling performance.

However, the loss of capacity and self-discharge due to the dissolution of lithium polysulfides hinders their practical applications. In this study, we performed density functional theory simulations to explore the importance of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as possible anchoring channels to immobilize soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2S2n, where n = 2,3, and 4). We quantitatively investigated the interplay between confinement effects and interaction energy of Li2S2n species with CNT to address the shuttling effect. Our results demonstrate that the interaction between CNTs and lithium polysulfides is governed by electrostatic interactions. Based on the interaction energies, Charge transfer analysis, and density of states, we found that CNTs facilitate the immobilization of Li2S2n. Results obtained from this study will provide useful guidelines to improve the performance of Li-S batteries. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Jyothirmai, M.

ReaxFF Reactive Force Field Simulations on the Influence of Teflon on Electrolyte Decomposition during Li/SWCNT Anode Discharge in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LI-ION BATTERIES; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; SELF-DISCHARGE; DENSITY; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; APPROXIMATION; HYDROCARBONS	Lithium-sulfur batteries are amongst the most appealing choices for the next generation large-scale energy storage applications. However, these batteries still suffer several formidable performance degradation issues that impede its commercialization. The lithium negative electrode yields high anodic capacity, but it causes dendrite formation and raises safety concerns. Furthermore, the high reactivity of lithium is accountable for electrolyte decomposition. To investigate these issues and possible countermeasures, we used ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate anode-electrolyte interfacial chemistry and utilized an ex-situ anode surface treatment with Teflon coating. In this study, we employed Li/SWCNT (single-wall carbon nanotube) composite anode instead of lithium metal and tetra(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (TEGDME) as electrolyte. We find that at lithium rich environment at the anode-electrolyte interface, electrolyte dissociates and generates ethylene gas as a major reaction product, while utilization of Teflon layer suppresses the lithium reactivity and reduces electrolyte decomposition. Lithium discharge from the negative electrode is an exothermic event that creates local hot spots at the interfacial region and expedites electrolyte dissociation reaction kinetics. Usage of Teflon dampens initial heat flow and effectively reduces lithium reactivity with the electrolyte. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

Herein, a sulfonate-rich COF (SCOF-2) is designed, synthesized, and used to modify the separator of Li-S batteries, providing a solution for the above challenges. It is found that the SCOF-2 features stronger electronegativity and larger interlayer spacing than that of none/monosulfonate COFs, which can facilitate the Li+ migration and alleviate the formation of Li-dendrites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ Raman analysis demonstrate that the SCOF-2 possesses a narrow bandgap and strong interaction on sulfur species, thereby suppressing self-discharge behavior. As a result, the modified batteries deliver an ultralow attenuation rate of 0.047% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C, and excellent anti-self-discharge performance by a low-capacity attenuation of 6.0% over one week. Additionally, even with the high-sulfur-loading cathode (3.2-8.2 mg(s) cm(-2)) and lean electrolyte (5 mu L mg(s)(-1)), the batteries still exhibit approximate to 80% capacity retention over 100 cycles, showing great potential for practical application.

Summary of main observation and conclusion We successfully prepared the Li-VO2(M) nanosheets via a facile lithiation method. After compositing with conductive carbon fibers, the sulfur host (Li-VO2(M)@CFs) combines the efficient adsorption ability of the VO2(M) with superior electronic conductivity of the carbon fibers. Besides, carbon fiber cloth used as the current collector can provide the 3D electronic channels. Therefore, the coin cells exhibited the superior reversible capacity of 1250 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and a low capacity decay value of 0.068% per cycle within 416 cycles at 1 C, indicative of the favorable cycling stability. Moreover, even at a high rate of 5 C, it also kept at a high discharge capacity of 401 mA h g(-1). In conclusion, this work discloses an attractive route to reduce the dissolution loss of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and enhance the overall performance of Li-S batteries.

However, the high-temperature performance of Li-S batteries is still facing great challenge due to the high flammability of the electrolyte, sulfur cathode as well as the separator. The separator modification is an effective method to improve the thermal stability of separator and the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries under elevated temperatures. However, the reported methods of separator coating are too complicated to be applied in the industrial production. Here, a novel thermo-stable composite separator (M-Celgard-p), in which a layer of silicon dioxide-poly (propylene carbonate) based electrolyte (nano-SiO2@PPC) with a high ionic-conductivity of 1.03 x 10(-4)S cm(-1)is coated on the commercial Celgard-p separator, is prepared by using a simple dipping method. Compared to the Li-S battery assembled with Celgard-p separator, the M-Celgard-p separator combined with a sulfur/polyacrylonitrile (S/PAN) cathode can improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, especially their high-temperature stability. As a result, the (S/PAN)/M-Celgard-p/Li cell delivers a high specific capacity of 724.7 mAh g(-1)at 1.0 A g(-1)after 200 cycles and presents a good rate capability of 1408 mAh g(-1)at 1.0 A g(-1)and 1216 mAh g(-1)at 2.0 A g(-1). More importantly, the (S/PAN)/M-Celgard-p/Li cell can exhibit a capacity retention ratio of 69.4% after 200 cycles at 60 degrees C. The M-Celgard-p separator with high Li-ion conductivity can not only block the "shuttle-effect" of polysulfides during cycling but also enhance the thermal stability under elevated temperatures. This work presents a simple dipping method to prepare composite separator with excellent thermal stability, which enhance the rate performance and cyclic stability of Li-S batteries under elevated temperatures. We believe this work can provide a new way to develop more reliable Li-S batteries for practical applications.

GA was also used together with nitrogen-rich graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) as the interlayer accommodating the soluble lithium polysulfides (LPSs). The interlayer was fabricated by a layer-by-layer coating technique on the flexible and processible carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate. The interlayer inserted between the cathode and the separator provides a strong lithium polysulfide adsorptivity. Adsorptive LPS species on the interlayer were also investigated by an ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. After finely tuned, the as-fabricated LSB using the S@GA cathode with the GA/GCN interlayer exhibits 75% higher specific capacity than the cell without interlayer. It has a low capacity fading of 0.056% per cycle after tested for 800 cycles. Our new design and configuration of LSB may practically be used in high-energy applications since it can effectively address many issues of the current LSBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To address such issues, herein, polar MoTe2 with different phases (2H, 1T, and 1T') were deeply investigated by density functional theory calculations, suggesting that the 1T'-MoTe2 displays concentrated density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level with high conductivity. By optimization of the synthesis, 1T'-MoTe2 quantum dots decorated three-dimensional graphene (MTQ@3DG) was prepared to overcome these issues, and it accomplished exceptional performance in Li-S batteries. Owing to the chemisorption and high catalytic effect of 1T'-MoTe2 quantum dots, MTQ@3DG/S exhibits highly reversible discharge capacity of 1310.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with 0.026% capacity fade rate per cycle over 600 cycles. The adsorption calculation demonstrates that the conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S is the rate-limiting step where the Gibbs free energies are 1.07 eV for graphene and 0.97 eV for 1T'-MoTe2, revealing the importance of 1T'- MoTe2. Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy investigation proved the suppression of the shuttle effect of LiPSs in MTQ@3DG/S cells during the cycle.

The random deposition of electrically insulating solid lithium sulfide (Li2S) from lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) limits the complete conversion of sulfur. The introduction of sulfiphlic metal compounds to facilitate the conversion is not accompanied by morphological control over Li2S deposition. To tackle this issue, we demonstrate a Janus-structured particle of oxide/carbon that regulates the Li2S growth. The Janus particles are prepared by directional thermal deposition of MoO3 onto CNT-agglomerated spherical particles. Under potentiostatic discharge, we observe that Li2S is deposited predominantly on MoO2-coated regions on CNT particles, accompanied by high discharge capacity. As the deposition of Li2S is microscopically controlled, the diffusion path of ions/charges in the electrode is preserved. Moreover, it is confirmed that the adsorption and catalytic properties of MoO3 are greatly promoted by its lithiation during the charge/discharge process. Janus particle cathode cells achieve excellent performance, especially under kinetically limited conditions, such as ultra-high C-rates or high cathode sulfur densities.

We show that the in operando reduction and lithiation of these PBI binders sustainably reduces Li-S cell impedance relative to nonredox active conventional polymer binders. This lower impedance enables high-rate cycling in Li-S cells with excellent durability, a critical step toward unlocking the full potential of Li-S batteries for electric vehicles and aviation.

The effect of carbon core grafting on the properties of the composite has been discussed. The XRD and SEM results reveal that sulfur is deposited on the surface of sulfonated and PEG grafted carbon core homogeneously. The ac impedance spectroscopy and charge/discharge tests show that the improved electrochemical properties of the composite are due to the grafting on the surface of carbon core. The cell, based on this core-shell structure composite with sulfur content of 82.5% as cathode material, exhibits excellent cycling performance with a reversible capacity about 800 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles and good rate capability when the sulfur loading of the cathode is about 2.5 mg cm(-2).

However, neither the initial "sulfur loss", nor the related exacerbated voltage polarizations have raised enough attentions. Herein, these issues have been rationally demonstrated by the interactions between polysulfides and metal sites inside MOFs pores, and the sluggish lithium ions transportation pathway which are closely related to metal sites and pore sizes within MOFs. Moreover, as a channel modification strategy, decorating MOF channels with negatively charged sulfonic polymer (NSP) can concurrently turn the charge environment of the MOF channels (by forming sulfurphobic interaction between polysulfides and NSP) and facilitate the transportation of lithium ions, resulting in greatly relieved initial "sulfur loss" and largely reduced voltage polarizations of Li-S batteries. Simultaneously narrow the MOF channels and turn the charge environment of the MOF channels reveled a win-win situation, which we anticipate will provide a rational design strategy for fabricating functional MOFs used as membranes and even solid electrolytes for various energy storage systems.

Although the performance of the resulting composite is acceptable at low current densities, the discharge capacity is stabilized at about 780 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.1C. It is poor at higher currents, about 75 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 5C. Carbon impregnation with a dual copolymer, polypyrrole (PPy) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), with conductive properties of an electronic and ionic type, respectively, not only improves the performance of the electrode at low current densities, about 1200 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.1C, but also at high currents, 640 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 5C. We believe that the copolymer not only improves the electrode conductivity, reflected in the electrochemical behaviour of the cell through different parameters such as a notable decrease in charge transfer resistance and an increase in the Li+ diffusion coefficient, but also increases the capacity of inhibition of the polysulfide migration because of the presence of heteroatoms (N, O, S) in its structure.

However, the array structures with extensive open spaces are not able to trap as much lithium polysulfide species (LPSs) as closed structures, thus seriously limiting their sulfur-loading capacities. Consequently, it is highly desirable to identify alternative sulfur trapping architectures that can facilitate combined advantages of array and closed structures. Herein, we have designed a sulfur cathode based on a "room-like" TiO2 array (RTA) structure, which can not only provide an electron transport path similar to that in the array structures but also adsorb LPSs as efficient as closed structures. As a result, this cathode with a significant sulfur loading of 2.8 mg cm(-2) was shown to enable remarkable utilization of sulfur together with an excellent cycle life. We also confirm that the inferior adsorption of LPSs in the array structure is not caused by insufficient adsorption sites but derives from the optimized direction of the concentration difference, which can make LPSs to exist for a longer time near host materials leading to reabsorption of dissociative LPSs. Our work offers a new avenue in enabling high sulfur loading essentials for realization of high energy density Li-S batteries.

The pore structure could be controlled by adjusting the hydrolysis time, hydrolysis temperature, concentration of the water glass and reactant ratio. Water glass could be recycled after use, making this strategy environmentally friendly and cost-effective. MCMs with three-dimensional interconnected networks, high surface area (852-1549 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (1.7-2.1 cm(3) g(-1)) and controllable pore diameter (3.8-15.1 nm) were constructed and have good electrical conductivity and a large volume for sulfur loading. The S/MCM composites with abundant residual nanochannels could not only benefit for the diffusion of electrolyte but also improve the utilization of sulfur and buffer the volume expansion of sulfur. The MCMs with relatively small mesopores manifest a high reversible capacity and rate performance owing to the strong confinement effect of polysulfides. MCM-1 delivered an initial capacity of 888.7 mA h g(-1) under 0.5C with a capacity retention of 700.5 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. The good electrochemical performance confirms that mesoporous carbon microspheres can be an excellent host material for sulfur cathodes. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Valence mediation of samarium towards polysulfides as a redox mediator for high performance Li-S batteries	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Tunable valence; Cathode; Samarium oxides; Shuttle effect	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; CARBON; NITROGEN; CYCLE; COMPOSITES; ADSORPTION; NANOSHEETS; RESERVOIR; CATHODES; HYBRID	Lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is attracting increasing attentions due to its distinguished theoretical capacity and energy density, whereas some of its intrinsic drawbacks strongly retarded its practical implementation. In this work, we rationally developed a mesoporous reduced graphene oxide (rGO) gel scaffold embedded pine-like Sm2O3 (Sm-MPG) as mediator along the target of synergizing lithium polysulfides trapping and reaction-intensifying. The results demonstrated that the chemical interaction between the reversible redox of Sm(3+ )and Sm(2+ )and lithium polysulfides conduces a high sulfur loading, high capacity, good rate capability, and good cycling performance of Li-S battery. The Sm-MPG-S composite cathode, with the sulfur areal loading of about 3 mg/cm(2), delivered an initial specific capacity of 989 mAh/g and retained a good cyclic stability with a low capacity decay ratio of about 0.042% per cycle at 0.5 C for over 1000 cycles. Even at a high current rate of 4 C, the cycling performance was still satisfactory with a capacity decay ratio of 0.053% per cycle and about 47% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

Mesoscale Elucidation of Surface Passivation in the Li-Sulfur Battery Cathode	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						lithium-sulfur battery; Li2S precipitation; surface passivation; morphology evolution; mesoscale modeling	HIGH-CAPACITY; S BATTERIES; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; CHALLENGES; POLYSULFIDES; GRAPHENE; ADSORPTION; PARTICLES; MECHANISM	The cathode surface passivation caused by Li2S precipitation adversely affects the performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Li2S precipitation is a complicated mesoscale process involving adsorption, desorption and diffusion kinetics, which are affected profoundly by the reactant concentration and operating temperature. In this work, a mesoscale interfacial model is presented to study the growth of Li2S film on carbon cathode surface. Li2S film growth experiences nucleation, isolated Li2S island growth and island coalescence. The slow adsorption rate at small S2- concentration inhibits the formation of nucleation seeds and the lateral growth of Li2S islands, which deters surface passivation. An appropriate operating temperature, especially in the medium-to-high temperature range, can also defer surface passivation. Fewer Li2S nucleation seeds form in such an operating temperature range, thereby facilitating heterogeneous growth and potentially inhibiting the lateral growth of the Li2S film, which may ultimately result in reduced surface passivation. The high specific surface area of the cathode microstructure is expected to mitigate the surface passivation.

Despite the relatively effective passivation of the negative electrode by LiNO3, fully charged cells self-discharged a quarter of their capacity within 3 days, although in the short-term cells can be recharged without any noticeable capacity loss. The processes governing the rate and reversibility of self-discharge in these cells have been investigated and explained in terms of the reactions of polysulfides occurring at both electrodes during idle conditions.

Herein, we demonstrated that the issue of shuttling effect of LiPSs could be effectively addressed by using a separator coating based on Ni3ZnC0.7 bimetal carbide nanoparticles dispersed in nitrogen-doped porous carbon material matrix containing small amount of Ni metal particles, namely Ni3ZnC0.7/Ni/NCNTs. When used as a separator coating of Li-S cells, the Ni3ZnC0.7 bimetal carbides demonstrated efficient adsorption and catalytic effect towards LiPSs, inhibiting the shuttle effect and enhancing the electrochemical performance of device. The Li-S cell still maintained excellent charging and discharging platform even at a high rate of 7C. Theoretical calculation shows that, compared to the monometal carbide Ni3C, the bimetal carbide Ni3ZnC0.7 possesses the advantageous properties of both sulfophilic sites of Ni and lithophilic sites of Zn, resulting in reduced energy barriers for lithium ion diffusion and improved catalytic capability, thus enhancing reaction kinetics of LiPSs. This work paves a new way to resolving the critical issues of shuttle effect, cycle stability and rate capability of Li-S batteries by taking advantage of synergistic effect of Ni and Zn in the bimetal carbide.

Although many hosts have been introduced into S electrodes to anchor high-order polysulfides, an effective procedure to select the hosts to improve the conversion kinetics of solid Li2S is scarce. Using density functional theory calculations, we proposed a procedure to screen catalytic hosts for solid and non-solid reactions of Li2S2/Li2S by employing the available functionalized Ti3C2T2 MXenes (T = H, O, F, S, Cl, Se, Te, Br, OH, and NH), under the precondition of good anchoring abilities for high-order polysulfides. For the solid-state reactions, it was found that Ti3C2Se2 is the optimal candidate for improving the reaction kinetics of solid Li2S. Suitable catalysts for different reaction processes between molecular Li2S2 and Li2S have also been proposed. We also proposed that sulfur cathodes doped with heavy atoms (Se or Te) belonging to the main group VI may significantly modify the reaction kinetics of Li2S. These results provide guidance on synthesizing MXenes with the given surface groups as the hosts and can accelerate the step of finding out other suitable host materials.

However, many challenges exist in the research field of Li-S batteries, such as low utilization rate of active substances and inferior cycling performance. Here, a simple and feasible preparation strategy was applied to fabricate the composite cathode of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendritic macromolecule polymer modified the Ketjen Black mixed sublimated sulfur (PAMAM@KB@S).

Here, we present the loading of Li2S nanoparticles into a carbon host that has been decorated with Co9S8 and Co (Li2S-Co9S8/Co) through a simple carbothermal reaction. The Co9S8/Co electrocatalyst functions as nucleation sites to ensure that Li2S is distributed uniformly throughout the composite. The molecular-level mixing of Li2S and the electrocatalyst provides a high level of catalytic activity toward LiS redox to improve Li2S utilization and mitigate LiPS shuttling, which prevents the accumulation of large amounts of inactive Li2S on the Li anode, thus ensuring efficient utilization of Li in the cell. Benefiting from this rational design, a high capacity of 969 mA h g(-1) is achieved in an anode-free cell with the Li2S-Co9S8/Co cathode. This work paves the way for the development of low-cost cathodes for anode-free Li-S batteries.

Hence, we designed a TiO2/Co3O4-CNTs composite derived from Ti-MOF (MIL-125) as the host matrix for sulfur cathode. The polar nature of metal oxides (TiO2, Co3O4) creates the adsorptive sites in the composite and leads to an efficient chemical capture of LiPS. The CNTs ensure the contact between S/Li2S and the host material with high conductivity, enhanced charge transfer and fast electrochemical kinetics. At the same time, the CNTs strengthen the stability of the electrode material. Consequently, the as-prepared TiO2/Co3O4-CNTs composite showed excellent electrochemical performance. The cell with S-TiO2/Co3O4-CNTs delivers an initial specific capacity of 1270 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and high rate performance with a capacity of 603 mAh g(-1) at 3 C.

Hollow Co3O4 Microspheres Grafted with Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanotubes as Efficient Sulfur Host for High Performing Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							COMPOSITE CATHODE; POROUS CARBON; LI-ION; POLYSULFIDES; INTERLAYER	Though the Li-S battery is considered as an attractive next-generation battery technology, a few challenges still need to be solved, for example, poor conductivity of the electrode, sluggish reaction kinetics, polysulfide shuttling, and cycle life. Here, we design an effective polysulfide immobilizer by grafting nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) on hollow Co3O4 microspheres and use it to prepare a freestanding sulfur composite cathode. This architecture imparts benefits such as superior electronic conductivity, better buffering of volume changes during electrochemical cycling, high polar surface for polysulfide absorption, and outstanding electrocatalytic activity to ameliorate the lithium polysulfide conversion kinetics. As a result, the composite sulfur electrode shows an initial capacity of 1104 mAh g(-1) (at 0.5C rate) and capacity retention of 73% after 300 cycles. Similarly, at a 1C rate, the electrode shows stable cycling behavior over 800 cycles with a capacity retention of 65%. The Li-S cell also exhibits high power capability, as at a SC rate, it delivers a capacity of 385 mAh g(-1). The synergistic effect between the polysulfide adsorbing additives Co3O4 and NCNT plays a major role in the high utilization of sulfur even when sulfur loading increases to 12 mg cm(-2).

However, the low utilization of sulfur caused by the poor conductivity of sulfur and shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) severely restrict the commercial application of Li-S batteries, especially in flexible wearable devices. Herein, a hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT)@Co-Co3O4 nanowire array (NWA)-integrated electrode was developed based on the rational design of density functional theory calculations, which shows simultaneous confinement adsorption and catalysis conversion of LiPSs. In situ Raman spectra further proved that the NCNT@Co-Co3O4 NWAs exhibit sufficient adsorption capacity and high catalytic conversion of LiPSs. As a result, the NCNT@Co-Co3O4@S electrode exhibited the desirable specific capacity and excellent cyclic stability at both low and high sulfur loadings. Moreover, pouch cells with the NCNT@Co-Co3O4@S cathode show higher capacity under flat or bending states and longer cycle stability than that of the reported results. This work provides a new approach for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries toward future wearable electronics.

Herein, a novel ultra-thin multifunctional separator is prepared by a facile coating of colloidal dispersion of Nb2O5 /reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites (rGO) onto porous polypropylene (PP) matrix. Benefiting from the physical blocking effect of rGO layer and chemisorption of Nb2O5, the shuttle of polysulfides has been greatly suppressed. Meanwhile, the rGO layer functioning as a conductive upper current collector can improve the sulfur utilization, while the Nb2O5 with high activity promotes the transformation of sulfur-containing species. With the assistant of Nb2O5-rGO function layer, the sulfur cathode shows significantly improved electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity of 1328 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and 754 mAh g(-1) retained after 200 cycles. The sulfur cathode also exhibits excellent rate capability and stable Coulombic efficiency of 91% without the addition of LiNO3 in the electrolyte. Moreover, the presence of thin Nb2O5-rGO layer also prevents the lithium surface corrosion and the dendrite growth in the lithium anode. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We explored the influence of the hydrothermal temperature, reaction time, and sulfur content on the composites. Analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the galvanostatic charge and discharge shows that the composites have excellent cycling performance when synthesis occurs at 180 degrees C for 12 h to provide a carbon:sulfur mass ratio of 3:7. The first discharge capacity is delivered at 931 mAh.g(-1) and it remains at 828.16 mAh.g(-1) after 50 cycles. The coulomb efficiency of the composites is above 95%. In addition, the rate capability of these composites is much better than that of sulfur. Sulfur molecules can be evenly distributed between the graphene layers and fixed to the functional groups on the surface of graphene by this one-step hydrothermal method.

In this study, VO2 and VS2 nanosheets were systematically studied as host materials for Li-S batteries through theoretical calculations and experimental testing. First-principles calculations demonstrated that VS2 showed more favorable properties, including the inherent semi-metallic conductivity of VS2, moderate adsorption strength for Li2Sn, fast Li+ transport with a low diffusion barrier, and accelerated surface redox reactions with a low Li2S decomposition barrier. In comparison, the low electronic conductivity and strong adsorption strength of VO2 increased Li+ diffusion as well as Li2S decomposition barriers of the electrode, resulting in relatively poor rate capability and cycle stability. In experiments, the VS2@S electrode exhibited superior electrochemical performance compared with VO2@S, giving a large capacity of 713 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and a low capacity fading rate of 0.13 % per cycle over 200 cycles at 1 C. The constructed relationships between S cathode and host materials could guide the future design of high-performance S cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Pores in carbon can adsorb sulfur and Li2S, and nitrogen-doped surface shows a stronger affinity for polysulfides through additional chemisorptions. However, how the physical properties of doped carbon, e.g., surface area and porosity, affect the performance of the non-polar carbon/doped polar carbon composite hosts is unknown. Herein, we reported the cotton-derived carbon/porous 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (Emim-dca) derived N-doped carbon, named C/PNC, and the cotton-derived carbon/imporous Emim-dca derived N-doped carbon, named C/NC. The surface area and porosity of the doped polar carbon in C/PNC and C/NC are controlled. The higher surface area of N-doped carbon makes more surface of cotton-derived carbon coated and more sulfur located on the surface of composite hosts. The micro-mesopores in the N-doped carbon can restrain sulfur but shows slow reactive kinetics at a higher current rate. The C/PNC cathode showed a higher discharge capacity of 1100 mAh g(-1) than that of 1027 mAh g(-1) for the C/NC cathode at 0.1 C and a lower capacity of 208.1 mAh g(-1) than that of 349.2 mAh g(-1) for C/NC cathode at 2 C.

Here, we report the preparation and utilization of composites with a sulfur-rich matrix and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) particulate inclusions as Li-S cathode materials with the capability to mitigate the dissolution of the Li polysulfide redox products via the MoS2 inclusions acting as "polysulfide anchors". In situ composite formation was completed via a facile, one-pot method with commercially available starting materials. The composites were afforded by first dispersing MoS2 directly in liquid elemental sulfur (S-8) with sequential polymerization of the sulfur phase via thermal ring opening polymerization or copolymerization via inverse vulcanization. For the practical utility of this system to be highlighted, it was demonstrated, that the composite formation methodology was amenable to larger scale processes with composites easily prepared in 100 g batches. Cathodes fabricated with the high sulfur content composites as the active material afforded Li-S cells that exhibited extended cycle lifetimes of up to 1000 cycles with low capacity decay (0.07% per cycle) and demonstrated exceptional rate capability with the delivery of reversible capacity up to 500 mAh/g at 5 C.

Herein, we designed a sulfur@Co3O4/polypyrrole cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries, in which sulfur was permeated into Co3O4 hollow microspheres and then embedded into the conducive network of polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes together. The S@Co3O4/PPy cathode showed an impressive long-term cyclability with a retaining discharge capacity of 370.6 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C and a low decay rate of 0.034 % per cycle at 1 C over 1900 cycles. Moreover, at high constant current of 3 C or 5 C within 1000 cycles, the batteries still guaranteed an enough capacity output of 180.2 or 135.9 mAh g(-1). The long-term cyclability of S@Co3O4/PPy composite was the synergistically attributed to the polar adsorption and encapsulation of Co3O4 hollow microspheres for sulfur particles or polysulfides, and the improving conductivity of PPy nanotubes, which was effective to restrain the shuttle effect, relieve the volumetric expansion and increase the diffusion kinetics.

Although the two new battery systems have the potential to satisfy the demand for a significant leap forward in energy storage technology, there remain significant problems to be addressed, including poor cycle stability and low rate capability for practical applications. To address these issues, much research effort has been invested. In particular, graphene, with its high surface area combined with catalytic properties, is considered to be a key potential material to advance Li/S and Li/air battery technology. Indeed, recent research into graphene has led to substantial performance improvements of Li/S and Li/air batteries. In this review, we describe recent achievements in Li/S and Li/air cells that have been facilitated by the application of graphene, together with the electrochemical reaction mechanisms and major issues facing both Li/S and Li/air batteries.

In this study, low-cost bacterial cellulose was used as the precursor for interconnected carbon networks and a supporting framework for impregnated molybdate ions. After freeze-drying and solid-state thermal reactions, necklace-like molybdenum carbide embedded in interconnected N-doped carbon nanofibers (MoC@N-CNF) was obtained to be used as a high sulfur loading host. On the one hand, the interconnected conductive carbon network enables fast electron and ion transport, and on the other hand, the embedded sulfiphilic MoC efficiently immobilizes polysulfides and catalytically promotes their redox conversion. Therefore, the as-prepared electrode coupled with the lithium polysulfide catholyte exhibits good cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.084% per cycle at 1C for 350 cycles and a high rate capability of 799 mA h g(-1) at 2C. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 12.3 mA h cm(-2) with an areal sulfur loading of 10 mg cm(-2) at 0.1C is also achieved.

The conductive MWCNT/PEG coating serves as (i) an upper current collector for accelerating the electron transport and benefiting the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the cell, (ii) a net-like filter for blocking and intercepting the migrating polysulfides through a synergistic effect including physical and chemical interactions, and (iii) a layered barrier for inhibiting the continuous diffusion and alleviating the volume change of the trapped active material by introducing a "buffer zone" in between the coated layers. The multi-layered MWCNT/PEG coating allows the use of the conventional pure sulfur cathode with a high sulfur content (78 wt%) and high sulfur loading (up to 6.5 mg cm(-2)) to achieve a high initial discharge capacity of 1206 mAh g(-1) at C/5 rate, retaining a superior capacity of 630 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles. The MWCNT/PEG-coated separator optimized by the facile layer-by-layer coating method provides a promising and feasible option for advanced Li-S batteries with high energy density.

Herein, we employ 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether as a co-solvent in the electrolyte of Li-S batteries to meet the demands. The co-solvent fosters the formation of a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anode, as revealed by Ab initio molecular dynamics and Femtosecond Stimulated Raman spectroscopy. The co-solvent results in an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% for lithium plating/stripping cycles. Full cells with a capacity ratio of 2 between lithium anode and the S@PAN cathode (3 mg(s) cm(-2)) exhibited a stable cycle life over 100 cycles at an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 2 mu L mg(-1), validating the high Coulombic efficiency of the lithium anode and demonstrating the compatibility of the electrolyte with both electrodes. To enhance the energy density, we prepared a hybrid cathode composed of 45 wt.% VS2 mixed with ZnS-coated Li2S@graphene as the cathode. Based on the mass of both electrodes and the electrolyte, the full cell delivers an energy density of 483 Wh kg(-1), which demonstrates viable Li-S batteries with the lean electrolyte.

Herein, a novel ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles uniformly distributed on 2D nanosheet-assembled 3D hollow nitrogen-doped carbon flowers (HNCFs) is designed. The Mo2C/HNCFs architecture with unique flower-like morphologies not only efficiently suppressed the aggregation of 2D nanosheets but also highly distributed the ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles that act as catalytic active sites for efficient adsorption and conversion of LPSs. Furthermore, the 3D hierarchical arrangement can afford ample internal space to accommodate sulfur species, large volume expansion, 3D electron pathway, and physical/chemical blockage of LPSs to reduce the loss of active materials. The Mo2C/HNCFs composite exhibits a high rate capability, unprecedented capacity retention of 92% over 100cycles at 0.5C placing Mo2C/HNCFs one of the best LPSs adsorbents and electrocatalysts.

To solve above problems, conductive FeOOH interlayer is designed as an effective trapper and catalyst to accelerate the conversion of LiPSs in LSBs. FeOOH nanorod is effectively affinitive to S that Fe atoms act as Lewis acid sites to capture LiPSs via strong chemical anchoring capability and dispersion interaction. The excellent electrocatalytic effect enables that reduced charging potential barrier and enhanced electron/ion transport is realized on the FeOOH interlayer to promote LiPSs conversion. Significantly, Li2S oxidation process is improved on the FeOOH interlayer determined as a combination of reduced Li2S decomposition energy barrier and enhanced Li-ion transport. Therefore, the multifunctional FeOOH interlayer with conductive and catalytic features show strong chemisorption with LiPSs and accelerated LiPSs redox kinetics. As a result, LSBs with FeOOH interlayer displays high discharge capacity of 1449 mAh g(-1)at 0.05 C and low capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle at 1 C, as well as excellent rate capability (449 mAh g(-1)at 2 C).

Herein, we prepared CeO2 nanorods decorated interwoven 3-D carbon cloth via facile one-step hydrothermal reaction and Li2S6- containing polysulfide as starting material to successfully improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery. First, strong chemical interaction toward polysulfides was successfully constructed by polar CeO2 nanorods and numerous oxygen vacancies on their surface acting as efficient polysulfides anchoring sites significantly enhanced the utilization of active material sulfur. Second, interwoven freestanding carbon cloth can considerably enhance redox kinetics through a 3-D interconnected network with abundant long-range electron transfer channels and can significantly improve redox kinetics by easy accessibility to electrolyte and abundant ion transport pathways. Third, the utilization of Li2S6-containing catholyte leads to uniform distribution of active material and improves sulfur utilization. Benefiting from the aforementioned advantages, free-standing 3-D carbon cloth with CeO2 nanorods decoration combined with Li2S6- containing catholyte (CC@CeO2 @Li2S6) electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1311 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and approximately 95% of the initial discharge capacity was remained after 100 galvanostatic cycles, manifesting superior capacity retention with minimal capacity fading of 0.050% per cycle.

Firstly, elemental sulfur is loaded into the CNT network by a solution-based processing technique. Then conducting PPy is coated on the surface of the S-CNT composite to form the S-CNT-PPy ternary composite by carrying out polymerization of the pyrrole monomer insitu. The ternary composite is tested as a cathode for lithiumsulfur batteries. The results show that PPy coating improves significantly the performance of the binary composites (S-CNT and S-PPy). The conducting PPy is believed to serve multiple functions in the composite: as a conducting additive, an active material, and an adsorbent and container to confine the polysulfides and prevent them from dissolving into the electrolyte. As a result, PPy coating on the S-CNT composite enhances its conductivity, capacity and cycling stability. The capacity of S-CNT-PPy is about 600mAhg1 after 40cycles, which is much higher than for the S-CNT composite (430mAhg1)	[Wang, Jiazhao; Lu, Lin; Shi, Dongqi; Konstantinov, Konstantin; Liu, Huakun] Univ Wollongong, Inst Superconducting & Elect Mat, Fairy Meadow, NSW 2519, Australia; [Tandiono, Richard] Raya Narogong KM, PT NIPRESS Tbk, Bogor 16820, Indonesia; [Wang, Zhaoxiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Phys, Lab Solid State Ion, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China		Wang, JZ (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Inst Superconducting & Elect Mat, Squires Way, Fairy Meadow, NSW 2519, Australia.	jiazhao@uow.edu.au	Konstantinov, Konstantin/F-8000-2018; Liu, Hua Kun/AAY-2180-2021; Dou, Shi Xue/D-5179-2012; Liu, Hua Kun/G-1349-2012; Wang, Jiazhao/G-4972-2011	Konstantinov, Konstantin/0000-0003-4919-6385; Dou, Shi Xue/0000-0003-3824-7693; Liu, Hua Kun/0000-0002-0253-647X; Wang, Jiazhao/0000-0002-1407-2166	Australian Research Council (ARC) [LP100100802]; industry partner PT Nipress TbK	Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); industry partner PT Nipress TbK	Financial support provided by an Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage Project (LP100100802) and industry partner PT Nipress TbK is gratefully acknowledged.

To address these issues, sulfur was loaded into a conductive 3D nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogel (NG(ae)) host with a finely tuned nitrogen doping content. In addition, an interlayer of graphitic carbon nitride coated on flexible and conductive carbon fiber paper (g-C3N4/CFP) was inserted between the cathode and the polymer separator to trap the soluble polysulfides. It was found that the as-fabricated LSB using the NG(ae) host with 4.2% N doping content and the g-C3N4/CFP interlayer can provide a specific capacity of 1271 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C with excellent stability over 400 cycles. The capacity fading is rather small (only 0.068% per cycle) while the coulombic efficiency is rather high (ca. 100%). This battery may be practically used in high-energy applications.

Therefore, this work focuses on the usage of mechanical processes to prepare defined carbon-sulfur composite materials that are subsequently processed to electrodes.

However, practical applications are still impeded by sluggish redox kinetics and the shuttling effect of soluble intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which induces irreversible loss of active materials, self-discharge, and thus poor cycle stability. Herein, a polysulfide-anchored catalytic polymer is reported to solve the shuttling behavior and improve battery performance. Natural polymer xanthan gum and konjac gum with abundant polar oxygen-containing functional groups (-OH, C=O, -COOH, and -O-) that induce strong binding interactions with lithium polysulfide and reduce the energy barrier of the reaction from S-8 to Li2S are entangled with a conductive carbon nanotube (CNT) skeleton as a polysulfide shielding interlayer. Combined with the highly conductive CNT porous network that facilitates Li+ ion transportation, the CNT-biomass gel interlayer is endowed with great capability of adsorbing and catalyzing the active sulfur. Benefiting from these synergistic attributes, the as-obtained CNT-biomass gel composite interlayer can achieve excellent performance of a high initial capacity of 998.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and a slight capacity decay of 0.078% per cycle at 0.5C over 200 cycles. More importantly, the battery demonstrates a cycle stability at a high sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm(-2). The proposed strategy will contribute to the design of biomass-derived materials for Li-S batteries.

Many papers focus on cells that exhibit very high capacity per gram of sulfur, which contain sulfur contents well below 50% which greatly reduces their overall energy density per gram of cathode. Moreover, they do not address the issues of practical sulfur loading and large-scale technology for commercial applications. In general, the lower the sulfur content, the higher the sulfur capacity. In this paper, a high sulfur content (80% S) carbon-sulfur (P-AB@S) material with core-shell structure has been successfully synthesized by grafting of polymer electrolyte (polyethylene glycol, PEG) chains and depositing sulfur onto the surface of electronically conductive acetylene black (AB). The PEG chains are inserted into the sulfur layer to reinforce the material's structural stability. More importantly, with a cathode containing 66% sulfur and approximately 3 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading on the electrode, P-AB@S as a cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries shows a specific capacity of 577 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) between 1.5 V and 2.8 V. Moreover, the preparation method of the P-AB@S composite is a facile, cost-effective and template-free method and easy to implement large-scale technology for commercial applications.

Through a one-step calcination, nano-sized ZnS particles coated with nitrogenous carbon are directly prepared from cheap industrial rubber vulcanization accelerators (a kind of organic sulfide), and then in situ oxidized to obtain nitrogenous carbon coated sulfur composites, with a three dimensional cell-stacked structure. This particular frame with a high level of in situ introduced polar functional groups provides abundant obstacles and chemical traps to effectively immobilize the intermediates, allowing for excellent storage performance and longterm cycle life. Outstandingly, the composite exhibits a remarkably low decay rate of 0.028% per cycle after 120 cycles at 0.1C-rate, under the sulfur loading of 3.6 mg cm(-2).

However, the accompanying problems of limited conductivity and inferior affinity of soluble polysulfide intermediates bring down their comprehensive performance for practical applications. Herein, the synthesis of a novel double-chain polymer network (DCP) binder by polymerizing 4,4-biphenyldisulfonic acid connected pyrrole monomer onto viscous sodium carboxymethyl cellulose matrix, yielding a primary crystal structure is reported. Consequently, the resulted binder enables superior rate performance from 0.2 C (1326.9 mAh g(-1)) to 4 C (701.4 mAh g(-1)). Moreover, a high sulfur loading of 9.8 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (5:1, mu L mg(-1)) are achieved, exhibiting a high area capacity of 9.2 mAh cm(-2). In situ X-ray diffraction analysis is conducted to monitor the structural modifications of the cathode, confirming the occurrence of sulfur reduction/recrystallization during charge-discharge process. In addition, in situ UV-vis measurements demonstrate that DCP binder impedes the polysulfide migration, thereby giving rise to high capacity retention for 400 cycles.

Conducting polymer-coated MIL-101/S composite with scale-like shell structure for improving Li-S batteries	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; GRAPHENE OXIDE; POROUS CARBON; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; SURFACE MODIFICATION; CATHODE MATERIAL; PERFORMANCE; IMPEDANCE; EFFICIENCY	Lithium-sulfur batteries are regarded as a promising energy storage system. However, they are plagued by rapid capacity decay, low coulombic efficiency, a severe shuttle effect and low sulfur loading in cathodes. To address these problems, effective carriers are highly demanded to encapsulate sulfur in order to extend the cycle life. Herein, we introduced a doped-PEDOT:PSS-coated MIL-101/S multi-core-shell structured composite. The unique structure of MIL-101, large specific area and conductive shell ensure high dispersion of sulfur in the composite and minimize the loss of polysulfides to the electrolyte. The doped-PEDOT:PSS-coated sulfur electrodes exhibited an increase in initial capacity and an improvement in rate characteristics. After 192 cycles at the current density of 0.1C, a doped-PEDOT:PSS-coated MIL-101/S electrode maintained a capacity of 606.62 mA h g(-1), while the MIL-101/S@PEDOT:PSS electrode delivered a capacity of 456.69 mA h g(-1). The EIS measurement revealed that the surface modification with the conducting polymer provided a lower resistance to the sulfur electrode, which resulted in better electrochemical behaviors in Li-S battery applications. Test results indicate that the MIL-101/S@doped-PEDOT:PSS is a promising host material for the sulfur cathode in the lithium-sulfur battery applications.

However, the Li-S battery suffers from "shuttle effect" of polysulfides. Thus, restricting shuttling means increasing cell performance and durability. DFT calculations showed that graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) exhibits strong interactions with Li2S (e.g. superior to graphene-like carbon) and acts as polysulfides trapping agent. In this work, the role of g-C3N4, synthetized from different precursor and at different polycondensation temperatures was systematically studied, using a double layer approach for the electrode preparation, which ensures direct interaction between g-C3N4 and soluble lithium-polysulfides. This systematic study confirms the importance of the morphological and superficial properties of the material. In particular, carbon nitride from urea precursor remarkably improves the performance of the sulphur cathode, increasing the specific capacity of the cell by 25% and improving its useful life over 500 cycles. According to the morphological characterization and the XPS analysis, benefits are achieved from polycondensation of urea at 550 degrees C. The obtained g-C3N4 shows the highest proportion of -NH2 species on the surface, which favours the interaction with polysulfides. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The surfactant-assisted chemical reaction deposition method strategy provides intimate contact between the Sand graphene oxide. Chemical reduced rGO with high conductivity as carbon coating layer prevented the dissolution of polysulfide ions and improved the electron transfer. This novel core-shell structured S@rGO composites with high S content showed high reversible capacity, good discharge capacity retention and enhanced rate capability used as cathodes in rechargeable Li/S cells. We demonstrated here that an electrode prepared from a S@FGO with up to 85 wt%S maintains a stable discharge capacity of about 980 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C and 570 mAh g(-1) at 1C after 200 cycles charge/discharge. These results emphasize the importance of rGO with high electrical conductivity after HI-reduced rGO homogeneously coating on the surface of S, therefore, effectively alleviating the shuttle phenomenon of polysulfides in organic electrolyte. Our surfactant-assisted chemical reaction-HI reduction approach should offer a new technique for the design and synthesis of battery electrodes based on highly conducting carbon materials.

However, several intrinsic and intractable obstacles are still impeding the practical implementation of Li-S batteries, which calls for advances in both sulfur and lithium electrodes. Herein, a 3D conductive scaffold is developed with hollow carbon polyhedra embedded on tubular carbon fabric (HPTCF) as self-standing matrix for both improved sulfur and lithium electrodes. Attributed to the high conductivity, abundant active interfaces, and favorable surface functionalization of HPTCF, reliable sulfur and lithium electrochemistry are simultaneously achieved. The results show an outstanding cyclability with a minimum capacity decay of 0.018% per cycle over 600 cycles in half cell, while the combined cathodic and anodic improvements further contribute to an excellent Li-S full cell performance with high capacity retention of 3.1 mAh cm(-2) at 200th cycle and superb rate performance of 2.5 mAh cm(-2) at 4 C rate under a reasonably high sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2). This work offers exemplary material engineering that concurrently and effectively tackles the problems in sulfur and lithium electrodes. This approach has great potential to promote the practical application of Li-S batteries.

However, the 'shuttle effect' of sulfur cathode, resulting in the poor cyclic performance of batteries, is a big barrier for the development of LSBs. To overcome this critical drawback, herein, a matrix of well-designed double carbon shells-encapsulated metallic Mo2C nanoparticles (Mo2C/C@C) is facilely achieved as an efficient sulfur host for high-performance LSBs. During the electrochemical process, the embedded polar and metallic Mo2C nanoparticles could effectively retard polysulfide migration. While for the carbon layers, they can not only act as conductive matrix but also promote the restriction for all sulfur species and maintain the structural stability simultaneously. Specially, the inner carbon layer is mainly for encapsulation and the outside one for surface-modification. As a result, such well-designed Mo2C/C@CeS cathode could effectively adsorb soluble polysulfides both from chemical and physical aspects, and well confines them inside the porous structure of Mo2C/C@C, thus achieving a high reversible capacity and superior cycling performance.

The unique nanostructure of the NiS2 nanosheet array can provide abundant active sites for the adsorption and chemical action of polysulfides. Compared with the sulfur powder coated pure NF (pure NF-S) for lithium sulfur battery, the sulfur powder coated NiS2/NF (NiS2/NF-S) electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performance. Specifically, the NiS2/NF-S delivered a high reversible capacity of 1007.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 C (1 C= 1675 mA g(-1)) and kept 74.5% of the initial capacity at 1.0 C after 200 cycles, indicating the great promise of NiS2/NF-S as the cathode of lithium sulfur battery. In addition, the NiS2/NF-S electrode also showed satisfactory electrochemical performance when used as the cathode for sodium sulfur battery.

It was demonstrated that polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was grafted on the PP separator surface by analyzing the results of FESEM, ATR-FTIR and XPS. The thermostability and wettability of the PAN-grafted PP (PP-g-PAN) separator were enhanced. Then, Li-S batteries were assembled using the modified separators. The cycling and rate capacity performance is improved clearly because of the higher liquid uptake, smaller porous size, better polysulfides absorption effect and interfacial affinity of the grafted separator. The modified separator can hinder the movement of Li2Sx effectively to prevent the shuttle effect of a Li-S battery. Therefore, this efficient method has great potential to be applied to the modification of other kinds of polymer membranes.

Nevertheless, the prevailing 3D-printed sulfur electrodes are solely based on carbonaceous materials; constructing electrocatalyst-equipped cathode to help expedite sulfur redox kinetics remains unexplored thus far. Herein, we develop a free-standing sulfur cathode via 3D printing using hybrid ink encompassing sulfur/carbon and metallic LaB6 electrocatalyst. Such unique architectures with optimized Li+/e(-) transport and ample porosity are in favor of efficient polysulfide regulation. Accordingly, an initial capacity of 693 mAh g(-1) can be achieved at 6.0 degrees C accompanied by a low capacity fading rate of 0.067% per cycle over 800 cycles (with a sulfur loading of 1.5 mg cm(-2)). To envisage practical applications, elevated sulfur loadings from 3.3 to 9.3 mg cm(-2) are further evaluated. Our study marks the first-time investigation on the introduction of efficient electrocatalyst into the printable ink for the construction of 3D-printed Li-S battery harnessing high rate capability and areal capacity.

However, developments in Mg-S batteries are in an early stage, and the system exhibits problems similar to those of early lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The significant challenges are the low Coulombic efficiency and short cycle life of Mg-S batteries, mainly associated with the well-known polysulfide shuttle. An obvious result of this phenomenon is the rapid self-discharge of Mg-S batteries. In this article, we present a multiscale simulation framework for metal-sulfur batteries. In our approach, we provide a continuum description of chemical and electrochemical processes at the positive and negative electrodes. In combination with a one-dimensional (1D) model for the transport of dissolved species in the electrolyte, this approach allows us to reproduce and interpret experimental data measured on Li-S and Mg-S batteries. We focus on the common properties of Li-S and Mg-S batteries as well as on the key differences causing the much more rapid self-discharge of the Mg system. We identify side reactions on the anode surface as a limiting process, while other factors, such as the mobility of dissolved species and solid-phase kinetics, play a minor role.

Nonetheless, its development is plagued by the severe polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics. Although single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising remedy to expedite sulfur redox chemistry, the mediocre single-atom loading, inferior atomic utilization, and elusive catalytic pathway handicap their practical application. To tackle these concerns, in this work, unsaturated Fe single atoms with high loading capacity (approximate to 6.32 wt%) are crafted on a 3D hierarchical C3N4 architecture (3DFeSA-CN) by means of biotemplated synthesis. By electrokinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, it is uncovered that the 3DFeSA-CN harnesses robust electrocatalytic activity to boost dual-directional sulfur redox. As a result, S@3DFeSA-CN can maintain a durable cyclic performance with a negligible capacity decay rate of 0.031% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1.0 C. More encouragingly, an assembled Li-S battery with a sulfur loading of 5.75 mg cm(-2) can harvest a high areal capacity of 6.18 mAh cm(-2). This work offers a promising solution to optimize the carbonaceous support and coordination environment of SACs, thereby ultimately elevating dual-directional sulfur redox in pragmatic Li-S batteries.

However, most of these studies were carried out. at room temperature, and the interaction between different components in the matrix is not often paid enough attention. Here, we report a graphene supported BN nanosheet composite in which the synergistic effect between BN and graphene greatly enhanced the adsorption for polysulfides, thus leading to excellent performance in a wide temperature range.

Nevertheless, seldom efforts have been devoted to probing the dual-directional polysulfide electrocatalysis to date. Herein, a CoFe alloy decorated mesoporous carbon sphere (CoFe-MCS) serving as a promising mediator for Li-S batteries is reported. Such bimetallic alloying boosts dual-directional electrocatalytic activity toward effective polysulfide conversion throughout detailed electroanalytic characterization, theoretical calculation, and operando instrumental probing. Accordingly, the S@CoFe-MCS cathode harvests a stable cycling with a low capacity decay rate of 0.062% per cycle over 500 cycles at 2.0 C. More encouragingly, benefiting from the optimized redox kinetics and delicate grid architecture, printable S@CoFe-MCS cathode achieves an excellent rate performance at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm(-2)and advanced areal capacity of 6.0 mAh cm(-2)at 7.7 mg cm(-2). This work explores non-precious metal alloy electrocatalysts in printable cathodes toward dual-directional polysulfide conversion, holding great potential in the pursuit of Li-S commercialization.

In this paper, Mg-doped V2O5 (Mg@V2O5) with excellent structure as energy storage material is synthesized via a surfactant-assisted hydrothermal technology. Physical characterization indicates that the Mg@V2O5 synthesized with the assistance of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-Mg@V2O5) has higher specific surface area (20.84 m(2)/g), uniformly smaller crystal size (2-40 nm), and rich pore structure. As the cathode active materials for lithium-ion batteries, the initial discharge specific capacities can achieve to 411.13 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and the capacity retention rate is 46.4% after 110 cycles. In addition, after the carbon coating, SDS-Mg@V2O5 is used as sulfur-wrapping matrix material for lithium-sulfur batteries and the initial discharge specific capacities can achieve 1325.76, 1147.34, and 938.79 mAh g(-1) at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5C, respectively. After 140 cycles, the capacity retention rate still remains at 86.7%.

Herein, a series of design from the viewpoint of both individual components and the I entire cathode in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cell was introduced aiming at addressing the issues of poor conductivity, leakage of intermediate polysulphides, and large volumetric expansion upon insertion of the Li ion. In the designed electrode, polydopamine (PD)-coated S nanosheets (NSs) were used as active materials, carboxylic acid functionalized multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT-COOH) as conductive additives, and poly-(acrylic acid) (PAA) as binders. Far different from the traditional hydrogen bond and/or van der Waals force linked electrodes, stronger covalent bonds formed by cross-linking of PD/MWCNT-COOH and PD/PAA into amide bonds, respectively, were built throughout the whole electrode to firmly integrate all of the individual components in the electrode together. As a result, the cathode demonstrated excellent cyclic performance with a charge capacity of 640 inAh/g after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A/g. Besides, the charge capacity decay after 500 cycles is as small as 0.021% per cycle, which represents the best capacity retention so far.

In this work, hydroxyapatite (Ca-5(PO4)(3)(OH)) nanowires were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and formed a hierarchical cross-linked network structure with aramid fiber paper (AP) to hinder the diffusion and dissolution of polysulfides, thereby effectively improving the electrochemical performance of the battery. HN adsorbs polysulfides by using chemical bonds such as hydroxyl groups and inhibits their diffusion to lithium negative electrodes; AP with 3D porous structure not only allows HN to adhere well to the surface, but also captures soluble polysulfides. The electrochemical test results showed that the primary discharge capacity of electrode with HNAP interlayer reached 1456 mAh/g at a rate of 0.05C. The remarkable cycling stability was obtained, the high reversible capacity of 840 mAh/g with negligible fading rate of 0.0243% per cycle at 1C were obtained after 200 cycles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanism of the Ritter reaction was proposed for the cross-linking of PVA-CN. The IPN-GPE has a high ionic conductivity (3.23 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C) and high t(Li)(+) (0.81). Li-S batteries with the asymmetric GPE exhibit good cycle stability (807 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C) and high Coulombic efficiency (similar to 99.6%). Furthermore, the self-discharge of Li-S batteries can be greatly inhibited, and only 6.4% of capacity loss is observed after 24 hours. The improved performance can be ascribed to the bi-functional GPE, i.e. immobilizing soluble Li polysulfides by the carbonyl groups of the IPN-GPE in the cathode side and promoting uniform Li deposition by the PDXL-GPE in the anode side. Our work has provided a meaningful strategy for in situ forming bi-functional GPEs to improve the performance of Li-S batteries.

Various host materials have been reported and designed as sulfur host materials in the lithium-sulfur batteries. Yet it still faced challenge when employed widely for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Therefore, new type of sulfur host materials must be developed for the high electrochemical performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbon via facile method and developed it as advanced sulfur host materials in the lithium-sulfur batteries. The unique porous structure could provide enough interior space for accommodating element sulfur and effectively inhibit the polysulfide dissolution at the same time. Owing to these merits, the as-prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbon/S (NPC/S) composites exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance with high specific capacity of 1352 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 C and superior cycling stability.

A mesoporous matrix is formed by a layers of r-GO, providing sites for electrochemical reactions and a highly conducting pathway for electrons. The highly porous structure is easily infiltrated by a catholyte solution providing a homogeneous distribution of the sulphur active material in the conductive graphene matrix and ensuring efficient electrochemical reactions. This is demonstrated by a high capacity, 3.4 mAh cm(-2), at high mass loading, 3.2 mg cm(-2) of sulphur in the cathode and in total the sulphur loading in the Li-S cell is even double (6.4 mg cm(-2)). Additionally, the presence of oxygen groups in the r-GO aerogel structure stabilizes the cycling performance and the Li-S cell with the fluorine free catholyte shows a capacity retention of 85% after 350 cycles.

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides seriously hinders their future practical applications. Herein, a dual-function cathode structure, consisting of 3D porous FeP/rGO microspheres supported on both aluminum foil and a commercial separator, exhibits excellent performance by providing strong adsorption with respect to Li2Sx (x = 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8) and S-8. In this rational design, the iron phosphide (FeP) nanoparticles act as a catalyst to accelerate polysulfide conversion and as the designated sites for adsorption. The 3D rGO porous conductive network can provide enough space for sulfur loading and to physically adsorb the polysulfides. More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations also verified the strong interactions (with adsorption energy values of -4.21 to -1.97 eV) between the FeP(111) surface and the sulfur species. The electrochemical results show that the cell using the dual-function cathode structure delivers a capacity of 925.7 mA h g(-1), with capacity degradation of 0.05% per cycle after 500 cycles, at a current density of 0.5C. It is also worth mentioning that the cell with sulfur loading of similar to 2.2 mg cm(-2) maintained a high capacity of 483 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C after 500 cycles. In summary, the above results demonstrate the promising application of the dual-function cathode structure for high-performance LSBs.

Carbon materials are the most used sulfur hosts, but their ability to adsorb polysulfide intermediates has been unreliable, thus recently many researchers have turned their interest to metal oxide materials. Here, we manufactured a composite of carbon nanotubes modified with manganese oxide nanoparticles (CNTs/MnO) as a sulfur host material. In Li/S cells, the CNTs/MnO-S cathode showed a rather better cycling stability over 100 cycles than a CNTs-S cathode with the same carbon/sulfur weight ratio of about 1 : 8. In addition, the CNTs/MnO-S cathode presented an initial discharge capacity of 716 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 5.0C, in contrast to the result of only 415 mA h g(-1) with the CNTs-S cathode. Physical and electrochemical characterization proved that the MnO modification does not vary the surface area of the CNTs but lowers their electrical conductivity. By carefully comparing the differences in the 1st discharge capacities of the two cathodes, the MnO modification could obviously improve the initial utilization of S especially at high current densities. The improved electrochemical characteristics of the CNTs/MnO-S electrode can be attributed to its properties of a stronger adsorption capability for polysulfides.

With thickness increase, the high tortuosity and long ion-path way lead to the sluggish kinetic in the electrode. Low tortuosity structure design can facilitate lithium ion (Li+) diffusion and electrolyte percolation into the electrode, which is an appropriate method to improve electrochemical performance. This paper focuses on the construction of low tortuosity electrode design. The hollow carbon micro-fibers of carbonized kapok fibers (CKFs) are decorated by superparamagnetic Co3O4 derived from ZIF-67, which are utilized to provide the vertical channel in the thick electrode. The orientation of CKFs@Co3O4 in the magnetic field provides the directional pathway to improve the kinetics of mass transport in the thick electrode. Compared with the conventional electrode, the low tortuosity electrode shows better electrochemical performance. With sulfur loading of 6 mg cm(-2) and around 300 mu m thickness, it exhibits the excellent reversible capacity of 866.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles and delivers a high initial capacity of 479.1 mAh g(-1) at 2C. The low tortuosity structure design reported from this paper is effective to relieve the sluggish kinetic of the thick electrode and is potential for practical application.

Among the main challenges of this technology, researchers are concentrating on reducing the well-known "shuttle effect" that generates the loss and corrosion of the active material during cycling. To tackle this issue, metal-organic frameworks (MOF) are considered excellent sulfur host materials to be part of the cathode in Li-S batteries, showing efficient confinement of undesirable polysulfides. In this study, MIL-88A, based on iron fumarate, was synthesised by a simple and fast ultrasonic-assisted probe method. Techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were used to characterise structural, morphological, and textural properties. The synthesis process led to MIL-88A particles with a central prismatic portion and pyramidal terminal portions, which exhibited a dual micro-mesoporous MOF system. The composite MIL-88A@S was prepared, by a typical melt-diffusion method at 155 degrees C, as a cathodic material for Li-S cells. MIL-88A@S electrodes were tested under several rates, exhibiting stable specific capacity values above 400 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)). This polyhedral and porous MIL-88A was found to be an effective cathode material for long cycling in Li-S cells, retaining a reversible capacity above 300 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C for more than 1000 cycles, and exhibiting excellent coulombic efficiency.

However, the all-solid-state lithium sulfur battery based on Li7P3S11 solid electrolyte has serious interface issues between electrode and solid electrolyte. The reaction of lithium metal and Li7P3S11 solid electrolyte would form a layer without lithium-ion conducting, which could impend the lithium-ion transfer and transport during cycling and causes increase of internal resistance and capacity fading. Herein, we introduce a solid electrolyte Li7P3S11 with BN doping for the all-solid-state lithium sulfur battery. The BN nanoflakes could partially isolate the Li7P3S11 solid electrolyte and lithium metal, thus improving the interfacial compatibility of electrode and electrolyte. With BN doped Li7P3S11 used as solid electrolyte, the all-solid-state Li/S battery exhibits an enhanced electrochemical performance with better cycling stability and higher Coulombic efficiency.

Electrodeposition or thermal diffusion were used to load sulfur onto the KCNs to obtain S-C hybrids for use as the cathode materials of Li-S batteries. The effect of the preparation method on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of the hybrid was investigated. It was found that small sulfur particles are evenly distributed on the surface of KCNs by electrodeposition while a sulfur layer is formed by thermal diffusion. The electrodeposited and thermally loaded C-S hybrids respectively deliver initial discharge capacities of 1 199.7 and 714.7 mAh center dot g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA center dot g(-1), which drop to 623.0 and 367.7 mAh center dot g(-1) after 200 cycles. The sulfur particles formed by electrodeposition have a higher utilization rate and stronger chemical bonding to the carbon than the sulfur formed by thermal diffusion, and this decreases the loss of sulfur during cycling.

J	Kizilaslan, A; Akbulut, H				Kizilaslan, Abdulkadir; Akbulut, Hatem			Assembling All-Solid-State Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with Li3N-Protected Anodes	CHEMPLUSCHEM			English	Article						all-solid-state batteries; electrochemistry; electrodes; lithium nitride; solid electrolytes		The construction of all-solid-state batteries is now easier after the successful synthesis of sulfur-based solid electrolytes with extremely high ionic conductivities. Utilizing lithium metal as the anode in these batteries requires a protective solid electrolyte layer to prevent corrosion due to the highly reactive nature of lithium. Li3N coating on lithium metal is a promising way of preventing the degradation of the electrolyte during charge and discharge. In this study, utilization of a Li3N-coated lithium anode and Li7P3S11 solid electrolyte are reported, where a quaternary reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/S/carbon black/Li7P3S11 composite is used as cathode in the assembled cell. Our results indicate that protecting the Li metal with a Li3N coating does not affect the electrochemical characteristics of the cell and extends the cycle life of the battery. A cell assembled with a protective layer was shown to having 306 mAh g(-1) capacity after 120 cycles at 160 mAh g(-1) current density, whereas a cell without protective layer had a capacity of 260 mAh g(-1).

J	Su, YS; Manthiram, A				Su, Yu-Sheng; Manthiram, Arumugam			Sulfur/lithium-insertion compound composite cathodes for Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Cathode materials; Sulfur composite cathodes; Vanadium oxide; Titanium disulfide	SULFUR CATHODE; LITHIUM	A part of carbon additives in sulfur cathodes is replaced by lithium-insertion compounds as they can contribute extra capacity and increase the overall energy density. Accordingly, VO2(B) and TiS2 were incorporated into sulfur cathodes as they can work within the same voltage window as that of sulfur. However, VO2(B) was found to be incompatible with the glyme-based electrolytes that are usually used in Li-S cells, but TiS2 performs well while coupled with sulfur. The S/C/TiS2 composite cathode delivers 252 mAh g(-1) more than that of pristine sulfur cathode (1334 mAh g(-1) vs. 1082 mAh g(-1)). The increased capacity is not only due to the contribution by TiS2 itself but also due to a better active-material dispersion and utilization. Serving as active reaction sites during cycling, TiS2 suppresses agglomeration of sulfur and facilitates better ionic! electronic transport within the cathode structure. This composite cathode design provides another direction for Li-S batteries to improve the overall energy density. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the effect of the carbon content of S-C composite electrodes on their physical and electrochemical properties was investigated. The S-C composite electrode with 60 wt.% S delivers a first discharge capacity of 1077 mAh g(-1). However, its capacity markedly decreases to 606 mAh g(-1) after 10 cycles, which corresponds to a capacity fading rate of 47 mAh g(-1), per cycle. To improve the electrochemical performance of the S-C composite electrode, carbon was partially replaced by V2O5. The S-C-V2O5 composite electrode with a composition of 60 wt.%-S, 30 wt.%-V2O5 and 10 wt.%-C exhibits a lower capacity fading rate of 23 mAh g(-1) per cycle in the first 10 cycles and better capacity retention than the S-C composite electrode over 50 cycles.

This CNF-S material was evaluated as the cathode material in lithium/sulfur cells with three different binders. The results of the SEM and TGA measurements reveal that CNF-S has a typical core-shell structure, containing 75.7 w/o sulfur coated uniformly on the surface of the CNFs. The effects of different binders on the potential profiles, electrode capacity and capacity retention with cycling were investigated. The electrode prepared with CMC + SBR binder has the best performance compared with PVdF and PEO binders, exhibiting a specific capacity of up to 1313 mAh g(-1) Sat the initial discharge and a specific capacity of 586 mAh g(-1) S after 60 cycles.

Herein, we propose the construction of a sandwich-structured interlayer with a membrane supporting layer and two-sided synergistic Co/N-codoped interfaces. The middle supporting layer with hierarchically porous frame and ultrahigh porosity of 90 % is constituted of carbon nanotubes (CNT) as core and N-doped carbon coating as the crosslinked shell, which can improve the conductivity of Li+ and electrons and provide enough space for polysulfide (LiPSs) anchoring and conversion. The two-sided synergistic Co/N-codoped interfaces including Co clusters and N active sites show strong adsorption of S/Li2Sx and exceptionally high catalytic activity. The theoretical calculation demonstrates that the LiPSs are preferentially adsorbed on Co clusters due to the stronger affinity, while the free N active sites can work as transition points for Li+ transfer during the LiPSs conversion and Li2S decomposition processes. In this way, the N active sites with transition capacity and Co clusters with high adsorption and catalytic ability exhibit high-efficient synergistic effect in mitigating the shuttle effect and reducing energy barrier of the redox reaction. Benefit from the hierarchically porous membrane and the two-sided synergistic Co clusters and N sites, high-efficient Li+/electron transport and catalytic activity are achieved simultaneously in Li-S batteries. The proposed strategy has important guiding significance for the design of novel multifunctional interlayers for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The key feature of 3D-VCNs is that they possess numerous 3D channels with macrovoids and mesopores, leading to high surface area of 1750 m(2) g(-1), which play an important role in loading large amount of sulfur, while vertically aligned microporous carbon nanosheets act as the multilayered physical barrier against polysulfides anions and prevent their dissolution in the electrolyte due to strong adsorption during cycling process. As a result, the 3D hybrid (3D-S-VCNs) infiltered with 68.3 wt% sulfur exhibits a high and stable reversible capacity of 844 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 837 mA g(-1) with excellent Coulombic efficiency approximate to 100%, capacity retention of approximate to 80.3% over 300 cycles, and good rate ability (the reversible capacity of 738 mAh g(-1) at the high current density of 3340 mA g(-1)).

To tackle these issues, a biomass (ginkgo-nut) derived N,S-codoped porous carbon (GC) with an interconnected honeycomb-like hierarchical structure is synthesized by a templated carbonization method, followed by hydrothermal growth of transition metal sulfide MS2 (M = Co, Ni) nanocrystals, giving rise to a hybrid 3D electrocatalyst. The unique structure constructed by N,S-codoping can expose more active sites and polar surfaces to physically confine and chemically adsorb polysulfides. Meanwhile, the embedded MS2 polyhedral-like nanoparticles further enhance the interaction with polysulfides and improve conversion and redox kinetics of polysulfides. Remarkably, with 80 wt% sulfur loading (similar to 2.5 mg cm(-2)), GC-CoS2 exhibits a reversible capacity of 988.8 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.1 C and an excellent capacity of 610.3 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 2 C, outperforming bare GC and GC-NiS2. Compared with the electrochemical performances of the representative reported biomass-derived sulfur host for Li-S batteries, evidently, both the discharge capacity and cycling stability of our GC-CoS2 sample are superior. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results suggest that CoS2 exhibits a higher binding energy towards lithium polysulfides and a lower energy barrier for Li+ diffusion on the surface compared to the NiS2 counterpart, suggesting that CoS2 is a better choice for lithium-sulfur batteries than NiS2. This work provides a new avenue to rationally design a carbonaceous catalyst host for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Benefiting from a unique micro/mesoporous structure and highly graphitic carbon, the NPCF film is capable of accommodating more sulfur, and maintains substantially higher mechanical strength and flexibility after sulfur loading as compared with traditional microporous carbon nanofiber films. As a free-standing and flexible cathode for Li-S batteries, the robust composite film exhibits excellent rate capability (540 mA h g(-1) at 5C) and cycling stability (76.5% retention after 500 cycles at 5C).

Low-temperature solid-state growth of three-dimensional bicontinuous nanoporous graphene with tunable porosity for lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							NITROGEN-DOPED GRAPHENE; VAPOR-DEPOSITION GROWTH; HIGH-RATE CAPABILITY; POROUS GRAPHENE; ION BATTERIES; ENERGY-STORAGE; PERFORMANCE; FOAMS; LIGHTWEIGHT; CATHODE	In this work we developed a solid-state-growth approach for the synthesis of 3D interconnected bicontinuous nanoporous graphene (NPG) with the aid of nanoporous Ni templates at low temperatures (below 800 degrees C). The as-synthesized nanoporous graphene comprises both interconnected tubular pores and non-tubular pores. The layer thickness of NPG can be controlled from monolayer to multilayer. The porosity and tubular pore sizes of bicontinuous NPG could be adjusted from tens of nanometres to hundreds of nanometers by varying the ligament size of nanoporous Ni templates. Three types of NPG with average tubular pore sizes of 1000 nm, 160 nm, 50 nm were synthesized. NPG can also be made in the forms of powders up to macroscopic foams depending on the shape and size of the Ni templates. The specific surface area can reach 555 m(2) g(-1). By encapsulation of sulfur in the tubular pores, the NPG-sulfur composites exhibited superb electrochemical performances such as enhanced capacities and cycling performances. The capacitive and cycling performances presented great improvements with decreasing the tubular pore size from 1000 to 50 nm and increasing the pore volume.	[Lu, L. Q.; Schriever, N.; Pei, Y.

Li polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle in the cathode and Li dendrite growth in the anode are among the toughest issues on the practical applications of Li-S batteries. By efficient cathode and membrane design, LiPS can be effectively trapped in the cathode side and the coin cells deliver a superior cycling performance of 2000 cycles. When the coin cell strategy is transplanted to a pouch cell, the possibility to achieve a long-lifespan Li-S pouch cell should be further explored. Herein, the gaps between the coin and pouch cell were probed and the failure mechanism of a Li-S pouch cell was explored. Compared with LiPS shuttle issue, Li metal powdering and the induced polarization are more responsible for pouch cell failure. Electrochemical cycling performance and ex-situ morphology characterization indicated that the continuously striping/plating of Li ions results in Li dendrite growth during cycling test, which exposes more fresh Li to electrolyte and induces the formation of dead Li powder. Therefore, the Li ion diffusion resistance is increased and the Coulombic efficiency is reduced gradually. When the cycled Li anode was updated by a fresh Li metal, the renaissance cell with cycled cathode vs fresh anode exhibited an improved discharge capacity from 314 to 1030 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C. Relatively to a neglected role in coin cells in most cases, Li metal anode tremendously affects long-term cycling performance of Li-S pouch cells. More attentions should be concentrated on efficiently protecting Li metal anode to achieve large capacity and safe Li-S cells with high energy density. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, CMK-3 with a tailored hierarchical pore structure (CMK-3 M) is prepared by using SBA-15 and Sn nanoparticles as the sacrificial templates. Compared to CMK-3, CMK-3 M possesses higher surface area and larger pore size, which are conducive to the transfer of electron and Li+ ions. The large contact area with sulfur also enhances the interaction of CMK-3 M and sulfur. Moreover, the generated micropores of CMK-3 M can contain smaller sulfur molecules, which avoids the formation of soluble polysulfides and suppresses the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides. Therefore, compared to sulfur-loaded CMK-3, sulfur-loaded CMK-3 M exhibits superior electrochemical performance. Besides, the performance of sulfur-loaded CMK-3 M can be further improved by coating with polyethylene glycol. This suggests that polymer protection is still an effective way to inhibit the polypyl sulfide shuttle.

Herein, we update the confinement approach by integrating ultra-fine Nb2O5 nanocrystals onto a well-developed mesoporous carbon framework, which could primitively combine the advantages of the physical entrapment and the chemical interaction of sulfur species. An electrochemical kinetic study further reveals that the Nb2O5 nanocrystals could serve as an electrocatalyst, significantly accelerating the kinetics of polysulfide redox reactions, especially for the reduction of soluble Li2S6/Li2S4 to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S. By overcoming the kinetic barriers of the redox reactions, the resulting mesoporous carbon microspheres/Nb2O5/S composites have a much improved electrochemical performance in terms of lower polarization, higher Coulombic efficiency, and much improved rate capability. They could deliver a high initial capacity of 1289 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C with a reversible capacity of 913 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. And more importantly, the ternary cathodes demonstrate an unprecedented rate capability with 887 mA h g(-1) at 5C, and a reversible capacity of 650 mA h g(-1) at 2C after 500 cycles. The concept of accelerating the kinetics of polysulfide redox reactions will pave the way for future development of high-rate and long-cycle Li-S batteries.

The initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of P/C is significantly improved (up to 93% for fully-prelithiated P/C) owing to the formation of an artificial solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which is characterized by SEM, Raman and XPS analyses. It ensures the application of P/C anode in real battery assembly. A partly-prelithiated P/C anode prepared by 20 s prelithiation treatment is paired with a LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode. The full cell delivers a highly reversible capacity of similar to 104 mAh g(LCO)(-1) at 1C rate and retains a CE close to 100% over 2000 cycles. Moreover, a fully-prelithiated P/C anode prepared by 10 min prelithiation treatment is paired with a high-capacity Li-free sulfur/carbon (S/C) cathode. This newly configured full cell delivers a good rate and cycling performance and a high energy density of 358 Wh kg(-1).

Here, we report Li2SO4/poly(vinyl alcohol)-derived Li2S/carbon nanocomposite (Li2S@C) strips at a record low temperature of 635 degrees C. These Li2S@C nanocomposite strips as a cathode show a low initial activation potential (2.63 V), a high initial discharge capacity (805 mA h g(-1) Li2S) and a high cycling stability (0.2C and 1C). These improved results could be ascribed to the nano-sized Li2S particles as well as their low crystallinity due to the PVA-induced carbon network and the low conversion temperature, respectively. An XPS analysis reveals that the C=C and C=O bonds derived from the carbonization of PVA can promote the conversion of Li2SO4 at such a low temperature.

Here we demonstrate that a facile spray drying method can be successfully applied to prepare the high-performance KB-S@rGO composite based on easily obtained commercial raw materials. The spray drying process realizes a quasi-core-shell structure: the KB-S congeries enrich the core, and the large GO sheets tend to distribute in the shell and therefore package the KB-S core. A simple post heating-process facilitate the uniform distribution of S and the partial reduction of the GO. The final KB-S@rGO composite achieves a significant enhancement in both S utilization and capacity retention: it reveals a high initial reversible capacity of 1250 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C. After 100 cycles, the cell still remains a reversible capacity of 883 mA h g(-1), responding to a cycle decay value of 0.34% per cycle.

Composite microspheres are several microns in size and with uniform size distributions that contained maltodextrin, iron nitrate, and TiO2 nanocrystals are formed using a pilot-scale spray-drying process, then transform into graphitic carbon-TiO2 composite microspheres with numerous empty nanovoids by a single post-treatment step and subsequent etching of metallic iron. The composite carbon microspheres not only have high pore volumes after the removal of metallic iron, providing sufficient spaces for the infiltration of sulfur, but also increase electronic conductivity in electrodes due to the graphitic carbon. Consequently, a high specific capacity of 516 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 5 C and a reversible capacity of 599 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles at a current density of 1 C are achieved, indicating the excellent capability of the material for use in energy storage devices. The structure of the mesoporous graphitic carbon-TiO2 composite microspheres make them suitable for use as a host material in sulfur cathodes and can significantly improve the electrochemical performances of LSBs.

J	Lang, XS; Wang, T; Wang, ZH; Li, L; Yao, CG; Cai, KD				Lang, Xiaoshi; Wang, Tan; Wang, Zhenhua; Li, Lan; Yao, Chuangang; Cai, Kedi			Reasonable design of a V2O5-x/TiO2 active interface structure with high polysulfide adsorption energy for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						V2O5-x/TiO2 active interface structure; Sulfur-wrapped matrix; High polysulfide adsorption energy; Density functional theory calculation; Shuttle effect	DOPED GRAPHENE; PERFORMANCE; CHEMISORPTION; EFFICIENCY; NANOCAGES; CATHODES; LAYER; HOST	A sulfur composite active material for lithium-sulfur batteries with a highly active interface structure can display excellent electrochemical performances. For this reason, in this paper, we design a type of V2O5-x/TiO2 active interface structure with high polysulfide adsorption energy as a high-performance sulfur-wrapped matrix. Physical property characterization indicates this interface is constructed from circular anatase structure TiO2 and anoxic vanadium oxide structure composed of V4+ and V5+ . After sulfur wrapping, Ti-S and S-S bond structures are produced by chemical and physical adsorption. Density functional theory calculations show that the V2O5-x/TiO2 interface has very high adsorption energy (-5.93 eV) with lithium polysulfide (Li2S6). After sulfur wrapping as a cathode active material, it displays low electrochemical charge transfer resistance (31.89 Omega) and high lithium-ion transfer efficiency (3.50 x 10(-12)). In addition, it has rather high discharge specific capacities of 1466.47, 963.84 and 801.16 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 C, respectively. After 500 cycles, the discharge capacity retention at 0.5 C is up to 76.11% corresponding to 0.048% capacity decay rate per cycle. This is the reason that the V2O5-x/TiO2 active interface has very strong adsorption to polysulfide and can effectively suppress the shuttle effect (Q(low)/Q(high) = 1.44 at 0.2 C).

The well-grafted N-doped CNTs (N-CNTs) and highconductivity GC layer coated on Co3O4 nanoparticles provided conductive channels for fast ionic/electronic transfer during charging-discharging. The Co3O4 nanoparticles inside the GC layer served as active polar sites for efficient anchoring of dissolved lithium polysulfides and ensured their reuse during redox reactions via fast charge transfer processes. Consequently, the assembled Li-S cell featuring a Co3O4@GC/N-CNT NF-coated separator and a pure sulfur electrode (70 wt% and 2.0 mg cm-2 loading) presented an excellent electrochemical performance, namely a high-rate capability and stable cycling performance at C-rates of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0C. In addition, the Li-ion diffusion coefficient of the assembled Li-S cell (10-8 cm2 s- 1) was one order of magnitude higher than those of the assembled Li-S cells featuring bare Co3O4 NF-coated and pristine separators (10-9 cm2 s- 1). The remarkable overall cell performance was attributed to the combination of highly conductive N-CNTs, GC layer, and polar Co3O4 nanoparticles, which effectively trapped polysulfides. Therefore, we believe that the proposed unique nanostructure synthesis method can provide new insights into the development of sustainable and highly conductive polar materials as functional interlayers for advanced LSBs.

The developed three-dimensional TiO/carbon nanofiber (CNF) architecture with the inherent interfiber macropores of nanofiber mats provides a much higher surface area (similar to 427 m(2) g(-1)) and overcomes the challenges associated with the use of highly dense powdered Ti-based suboxides/monoxide materials, thereby allowing for high active sulfur loading among other benefits. The developed TiO/CNF-S cathodes exhibit high initial discharge capacities of similar to 1080, similar to 975, and similar to 791 mAh g(-1) at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 C rates, respectively, with long-term cycling. Furthermore, freestanding TiO/CNF-S cathodes developed with rapid sulfur melt infiltration (similar to 5 s) eradicate the need of inactive elements, viz., binders, additional current collectors (Al-foil), and additives. Using postmortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman analysis, this study is the first to reveal the presence of strong Lewis acid-base interaction between TiO (3d(2)) and S-x(2-) through the coordinate covalent Ti-S bond formation. Our results highlight the importance of developing Ti-suboxides/monoxide-based nanofibrous conducting polar host materials for next-generation Li-S batteries.

Herein, we report that tungsten carbide not only affords strong sulfiphilic surface moieties but also provides an efficient catalysis to enhance the polysulfide fragmentation, leading to a drastic improvement in the electrode kinetics. We show that tungsten carbide acts as a superb anchoring material for the long-chain polysulfide and also promotes the dissociation of short-chain polysulfide during the electroreduction process. This leads to a high-rate performance of the composite cathode loaded with tungsten carbide, delivering a markedly enhanced discharge capacity of 780 mA h g(-1) at a high current rate of 5 C, when it is applied with a combination of a carbon-coated separator for the polysulfide confinement. Hence, this work presents a new strategic approach for a high-power lithium-sulfur battery.

The sulfur based composite cathode was prepared using two methods; (Case 1) mortar-mixing and (Case 2) planetary ball milling at a rotation speed of 370 rev/min for 15 min. SEM analysis results indicated that the 'Case 2' method improved the distribution of sulfur, carbon and solid electrolyte particles, with a reduction in particle size. This effect was reflected in impedance spectra, and eventually in charge-discharge capacity: the electrode/electrolyte interface resistance was reduced so that the average charge-discharge capacities increased with the 'Case 2' cathode. Thus, the present work indicates the method of preparing the sulfur composite cathode profoundly affects the performance of solid state Li-S batteries.

J	Huang, PF; Li, CF; Wang, YW; Dang, B				Huang, Pengfei; Li, Chunfeng; Wang, Yinwei; Dang, Bo			The preparation and electrochemical performance study of the carbon nanofibers/sulfur composites	IONICS			English	Article						Carbon nanofiber; Electrochemical performance; Shuttle effect; Composites	LITHIUM; CATHODE	Many works have been conducted in the field of lithium-sulfur batteries, which have high specific capacity and energy density. Besides, the element sulfur is environmental friendly, low cost, and abundant. During the past decades, great efforts have been paid to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. However, there is still a long way to achieve the wide application of lithium-sulfur batteries. The main reasons are the poor electronic conductivity and severe shuttle effect of the soluble polysulfide in the lithium-sulfur batteries. Therefore, it is the efficient method to design the sulfur host materials, which could improve the electronic conductivity and inhibit the shuttle effect in the lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, carbon nanofibers were prepared and designed as sulfur hosts in lithium-sulfur batteries. Due to the presence of the carbon nanofibers, the as-prepared carbon nanofibers/S (CNFs/S) composites exhibited excellent electrochemical performances.

The use of LiBH4 and its compatibility with Li metal permits the utilization of Li anode that improves the vitality of composite electrodes. The GO-S and rGO-S nanocomposites with different proportions have been synthesized. Their structural and morphological characterizations were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results are presented.

However, extensive use of conductive carbon fillers in cell designs/technology would induce electrolytic overconsumption and thereby shelve high-energy-density promise of Li-S cells. To cut down carbon usage, we propose the incorporation of multi-functionalized NiFe2O4 quantum dots (QDs) as affordable additive substitutes. The total carbon content can be greatly curtailed from 26% (in traditional S/C cathodes) to a low/commercial mass ratio (similar to 5%). Particularly, note that NiFe2O4 QDs additives own superb chemisorption interactions with soluble Li2Sn, molecules and proper catalytic features facilitating polysulfide phase conversions and can also strengthen charge-transfer capability/redox kinetics of overall cathode systems. Benefiting from these intrinsic properties, such hybrid cathodes demonstrate prominent rate behaviors (decent capacity retention with - 526 mAh g(-1) even at 5 A g(-1)) and stable cyclic performance in LiNO3-free electrolytes (only 0.08% capacity decay per cycle in 500 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1)). This work may arouse tremendous research interest in seeking other alternative QDs and offer an economical/more applicable methodology to construct low-carbon-content electrodes for practical usage.

However, their practical application is hindered by existing drawbacks such as poor cycling life and low Coulombic efficiency due to the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). We herein present an in situ constructed VO2-VN binary host which combines the merits of ultrafast anchoring (VO2) with electronic conducting (VN) to accomplish smooth immobilization-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs. Such synchronous advantages have effectively alleviated the polysulfide shuttling, promoted the redox kinetics, and hence improved the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on the VO2-VN/graphene host exhibited an impressive rate capability with similar to 1105 and 935 mA h g(-1) at 1C and 2C, respectively, and maintained long-term cyclability with a low capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle within 800 cycles at 2C. More remarkably, favorable cyclic stability can be attained with a high sulfur loading (13.2 mg cm(-2)). Even at an elevated temperature (50 degrees C), the cathodes still delivered superior rate capacity. Our work emphasizes the importance of immobilization-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs toward the rational design of high-load and long-life Li-S batteries.

Here, the self-assembly of bimetallic selenides on nitrogen-doped MXene (CoZn-Se@N-MX) based on the self-assembly of metal-organic framework and MXene is reported. A combination of 0D CoZn-Se nanoparticles and 2D N-MX nanosheet co-catalysts forms double lithiophilic-sulfifilic binding sites that effectively immobilize and catalytically convert LiPS intermediates. This 0D-2D heterostructure catalyst has a hierarchical porous architecture with a large active area and enables rapid Li ion diffusion, reduces the activation energy of Li2S deposition, and lowers the energy barrier of Li2S dissolution. In addition, an assembled CoZn-Se@N-MX hybrid synergistically prevents the aggregation of the CoZn-Se nanoparticles and restacking of the active areas of N-MX nanosheets during assembly and the LiPS conversion process. The Li-S battery with this 0D-2D catalyst delivers excellent rate capability, ultralong cycling life (over 2000 cycles), and a high areal capacity of 6.6 mAh cm(-2) with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 mu L mg(-1).

Regulating the electronic structure of metal oxides at the atomic level could be an effective strategy to improve the intrinsic catalytic activity for polysulfides conversion. Herein, we proposed cobalt-doped stannic oxide which was uniformly grown on carbon nanotubes (Co-SnO2@CNT) as a multifunctional sulfur host. Evidenced by experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, it is found that due to the appropriate doping amount, this host is endowed with abundant polar sites that exhibit robust polysulfides adsorption and confinement, fast Li-ion, and electron transfer, and rapid conversion reaction kinetics of sulfur species. As a result, the Co-SnO2@CNT host exhibits high sulfur loading (-79.3 wt%), excellent rate capability (808 mAh g(-1) at 2C), and superior long-term cycle stability (0.042% per cycle degeneration for 600 cycles at 1C). Excellent performances are also obtained at practical lean electrolyte conditions (E/S ratio 5 uL mg(-1)). This work verifies the feasibility of cobalt-doped SnO2 as catalyst and adsorbent for polysulfide species and reveals the internal mechanism of transition metal doped metal oxides at an atomic scale. In addition, a strategy was proposed that could overcome the intrinsic drawbacks of metal oxides and open up more feasible ways for highperformance lithium-sulfur batteries.

This novel photo-synthetic nitrogen doping method not only reduced the GO in a short time but also induced nitrogen doping into the composite easily. Within the rationally designed sandwich-like architecture, Ti(3)C(2)Tx interacted with reduced GO to construct a 3D conductive layer structure while inhibiting mutual stacking, thereby facilitating fast ion/electron transport and strong chemisorption for polysulfides, and also effectively buffering the volume expansion of electrodes during the discharge. In addition, the moderate chemical modulation induced by nitrogen doping achieved abundant defects and active sites, thereby improving the chemical immobilization for polysulfides. As sulfur host, the N-RGO/Ti(3)C(2)Tx sandwich-like architecture with 76.4 wt% sulfur could deliver excellent electrochemical performance due to the synergy of the above-mentioned merits. A superior reversible capacity of approximately 1180 mAh g(-1)could be achieved over 200 cycles at 0.1 C. Even after cycling 200 times at 0.5 C, a high capacity of 850 mAh g(-1)could still be obtained with a capacity retention of 82.5%.

The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller tests indicated the number of activation effectively improves the specific surface area and pore volume of the BPPC. Amongst, the BPPC-2 (activated twice) possesses ultrahigh specific surface area (2044.57 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume (2.40 cm(3) g(-1)) on account of the improved hierarchical porous microstructure. After S loading process, the resultant C/S composites were introduced as cathode material in Li-S batteries. The S/BPPC-2 composite cathode exhibited a higher initial specific capacity (1481.54 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and a better reversible capacity (351 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 C) than those of others. It also exhibited excellent high rate performance even at 5 C. The enhanced electrochemical performances were ascribed to the improved specific surface area and larger pore volume of the BPPC-2, which effectively facilitated the intimate contact between sulfur and the conductive matrix, accommodating severe volume change. Besides, the micro/mesopores provided high adsorption power to inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides. This research suggested that the activation number played a key role in improving the electrochemical performance of composite cathode in Li-S batteries.

With the large internal cavity, all the nanospheres can effectively ensure high sulfur loading and mitigate the shuttling of the polysulfide. The externally grown bamboo-like carbon nanotubes build up an admirable three-dimensional network for facilitating the rapid transport of ions to improve redox kinetics. Moreover, both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that there is a chemical coupling between the two valence iron ions in Fe3O4 and sulfur for the benefit of the fixation of sulfur, playing a role in catalyzing the conversion of the polysulfide. Combining the above virtues, 2.1 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading still retains a high discharge capacity of 538.5 mA h g(-1) after 1800 cycles at 1C and the capacity decay is only 0.023% per cycle. With a higher sulfur loading (5.5 mg cm(-2)), a stable reversible capacity of 739.4 mA h g(-1) is also acquired.

In this work, PEI functionalized electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs-PEI) were prepared to host sulfur to form carbon nanofibers polyethylenimine/sulfur (CNFs-PEI/S) composites for high performance Li-S batteries. The as-prepared CNFs-PEI/S cathode with a sulfur content of 67% delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1279 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and retains a cycling stability for 80 cycles with a low capacity fading rate of 0.26% per cycle. Further, compared with CNFs/S, the CNFs-PEI/S revealed an enhanced rate capability and cyclic stability primarily attributed to the formation of the electrostatic interaction between amino groups in the PEI chains and LiPS intermediates, leading to suppression of LiPS dissolution and restraint of the shuttle effect during the charge-discharge cycling process. An in situ rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) collection experiment is designed to further examine the LiPS dissolution extent from a sulfur electrode during cycling. A maximum slope of ring current change with time (voltage) occurred at the major LiPS intermediate dissolution step over a voltage range between 2.4 and 2.0 V during disk negative scan (reduction). The CNFs-PEI/S showed a lower maximum slope value, which can be attributed to a lower dissolution of LiPS intermediates from the sulfur electrode. The present study also demonstrated the proposed simple RRDE experiment is a useful method to evaluate the dissolution properties of LiPS intermediates from various sulfur electrode materials.

The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared multi-composites as active materials are tested in the electrolyte with a high concentration lithium salt (LiTFSI) in different mixed solvents of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), respectively. It is demonstrated that the high concentration lithium salt (LiTFSI) and high viscous solvent have a great impact on the cycle stability of the multi-composite by suppressing polysulfide dissolution at the slight expense of the discharge potential plateaus (width and height). The as-prepared multi-composites present the excellent cycle performance in the electrolyte with 5 M LiTFSI in DOL/DME. Meanwhile, when the lower viscous DME solvent is replaced by the higher viscous TEGDME solvent in the electrolyte with 3 M LiTFSI, the optimized cycle stability is still obtained for the as-prepared multi-composites based on the evaluation of the discharge capacity and cycle stability. Therefore, the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared multi-composites is obviously influenced by the common ion effect and viscosity of the electrolyte, which are induced from both the lithium salt and solvent.

Still, potential mechanics-based issues exist that must be addressed: lithiation of sulfur produces an enormous volume expansion (similar to 80%). In other high capacity electrodes, large expansions generate considerable stresses that can lead to mechanical damage and capacity fading. However, the mechanics of electrochemical cycling of sulfur is fundamentally distinct from other systems due to solid-to-liquid, liquid-to-liquid, and liquid-to-solid phase transformations, and thus remains poorly understood. To this end, we measure the evolution of stresses in composite sulfur cathodes during electrochemical cycling and link these stresses to structural evolution. We observe that nucleation and growth of solid lithium-sulfur phases induces significant stresses, including irreversible stresses from structural rearrangements during the first cycle. However, subsequent cycles show highly reversible elastic mechanics, thereby demonstrating strong potential for extended cycling in practical applications.

Regrettably, the electrical insulation nature of sulfur, the volume expansion during lithiation, and the internal shuttle effect aroused by the polysulfides dissolution are the central issues for sulfur cathodes. Here, CoFe2O4@C nanocages derived from Prussian blue analogues and polydopamine were utilized as a sulfur host to address these problems. The polar Co-Fe oxide afforded chemical adsorption sites for anchoring polysulfides to reduce the shuttling effect. The hollow core structure of the nanocages could withstand the large volume change during lithiation and delithiation processes. The conductive carbon layer on the nanocages could ameliorate the extremely low electrical conductivity of S and Li2S. The S/CoFe2O4@C cathode demonstrated high capacity and excellent cyclability (821 mA h g(-1)after 100 cycles at 0.5C). More importantly, the combinational strategies of good conductivity, physical space encapsulation, and chemical adsorption provide a means of resolving the current cathode issues in Li-S batteries.

To address the above issues, herein we design and synthesize a novel polymer binder with single lithium-ion channels allowing fast lithium-ion transport while blocking the shuttle of unnecessary polysulfide anions. In situ UV-vis spectroscopy measurements reveal that the prepared polymer binder has effective immobilization to polysulfide intermediates. As expected, the resultant sulfur cathode achieves an excellent specific capacity of 1310 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% at 0.5 C after 100 cycles and stable cycling performance for 300 cycles at 1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)). This study reports a new avenue to assemble a polymer binder with a single lithium-ion channel for solving the serious problem of energy attenuation of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, their commercialization has been hindered due to many prevailing issues, including the poor electrical conductivity of sulfur and the high solubility of polysulfide intermediates. We report a facile and scalable, solution-based spray drying technique to synthesize hollow N-doped mesoporous carbon microspheres (HNMCMs) with an exceptionally large surface area of 872 m(2).g(-1) using outdated dairy products as carbon source. The novel electrode prepared from a high loading of sulfur accommodated by the HNMCM hosts delivers high initial discharge capacities of 781 and 682 mAh.g(-1) at 0.5 and 1 C, respectively. It was further obtained that the capability retention can be retained as high as 79.4% at 1 C after 400 cycles. The excellent cyclic stability and rate capability of the HNMCM/S cathode can be ascribed to the large surface area, high electrical conductivity enhanced by the high content of doped nitrogen and unique hollow microsphere structure of HNMCMs.	[Luo, Rongjie; Lu, Yang; Hou, Xiaoyi; Yu, Qiuhong; Peng, Tao; Yan, Hailong; Luo, Yongsong] Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Engn, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China; [Luo, Rongjie; Lu, Yang; Hou, Xiaoyi; Yu, Qiuhong; Peng, Tao; Yan, Hailong; Luo, Yongsong] Xinyang Normal Univ, Key Lab Microelect & Energy Henan Prov, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China; [Wu, Naiteng; Liu, Xianming] Luoyang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Luoyang 471934, Peoples R China; [Kim, Jang-Kyo] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China		Luo, YS (corresponding author), Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Engn, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China.; Luo, YS (corresponding author), Xinyang Normal Univ, Key Lab Microelect & Energy Henan Prov, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China.; Wu, NT; Liu, XM (corresponding author), Luoyang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Luoyang 471934, Peoples R China.	wunaiteng@gmail.com; myclxm@163.com; ysluo@xynu.edu.cn	Kim, Jang-Kyo/AHH-7817-2022; Kim, Jang-Kyo/B-3099-2010	Kim, Jang-Kyo/0000-0002-5390-8763	program for Science AMP; Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province [15HASTIT018]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51502257, U1304108, 21373107, 61574122]; Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in Universities in Henan Province [13IRTSTHN018]	program for Science AMP; Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in Universities in Henan Province	This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51502257, 61574122, 21373107 and U1304108), the Innovative Research Team (in Science and Technology) in Universities in Henan Province (No. 13IRTSTHN018), and the program for Science & Technology Innovation Talents in Universities of Henan Province (No. 15HASTIT018).		57	11	11	4	50	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	2365-6549			CHEMISTRYSELECT	ChemistrySelect	APR 17	2018	3	14					3952	3957		10.1002/slct.201703038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.201703038			6	Chemistry, Multidisciplinary	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry	GD3ER					2022-07-15	WOS:000430386800011

Guided by first-principles calculations, in this work, a porous carbon nanofiber with an oxygen-dominated Ti3C2 MXene nanosheet (denoted as O-Ti3C2@CNF) is designed and synthesized as an all-purpose interlayer for the Li-S system. The oxygen-functionalized strategy is achieved by stepwisely controllable surface modifications and moderate oxygen regulation, forming an oxygen-rich MXene surface. On the one hand, the MXene and porous carbon nanofiber collaboratively construct a 3D conductive scaffold, which renders strong physical/chemical affinity and fast reaction kinetics toward sulfur species. On the other hand, the O-Ti3C2@CNF enables the high-flux Li diffusion and achieves the dendrite-free Li anode due to its 3D architecture with abundantly lithophilic active centers. Based on the abovementioned merits, a practical, flexible Li-S pouch battery was assembled by employing a symmetrical interlayer design, which delivered an excellent areal capacity of 5.2 mAh cm(-2) over 30 cycles (under the conditions of sulfur loading up to 6.7 mg cm(-2) and electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 6.0 mL g(-1)). The symmetrically designed interlayer as amphiphilic membrane nanoreactor may inspire the material engineering in practical Li-S pouch cells.

Sulfur and Li2S are recognized as solid at room temperature, and solid-liquid phase transitions are the limiting steps in Li-S batteries. Here, we visualize the distinct sulfur growth behaviors on Al, carbon, Ni current collectors and demonstrate that (i) liquid sulfur generated on Ni provides higher reversible capacity, faster kinetics, and better cycling life compared to solid sulfur; and (ii) Ni facilitates the phase transition (e.g., Li2S decomposition). Accordingly, light-weight, 3D Ni-based current collector is designed to control the deposition and catalytic conversion of sulfur species toward high-performance Li-S batteries. This work provides insights on the critical role of the current collector in determining the physical state of sulfur and elucidates the correlation between sulfur state and battery performance, which will advance electrode designs in high-energy Li-S batteries.

Adsorption behavior of Li2Sx (x=1, 2, 4, 8) with nitrogen-doped, boron-doped graphene and reduced graphene oxides (r-GOs) are investigated in this study by DFT method. It is discovered that graphene with pyridinic N doping (PD-N) and pyrrolic N doping (PL-N) are able to benefit the nucleation for short-chain lithium-polysulfides (Li2S/Li2S2) through Li-N interaction. r-GOs can also enhance the nucleation to some extent through Li-O interaction, which is not as good as Li-N interaction. At the same time, pristine graphene, graphene with graphitic N (GRN) and B-doped graphene can only provide Li-C interaction, which is weaker than Li-O and Li-N. This makes the sequence of adsorption strength to be PD-N approximate to PL-D>r-GO>B>GRN approximate to pristine graphene. The unique mechanism of B-doped graphene adsorbed with Li2S/Li2S2 is also discovered.

This modified separator, when used in a Li-Li symmetrical cell, suppresses Li dendrite growth by maintaining a uniform ionic flux on top of the Li metal. When employed in a lithium-sulfur battery (LSB), the thin graphite layer can retard the shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through a physical interaction, as demonstrated through the live discharge of an H-cell. Moreover, the conductivity of the graphite resulted in it, also acting as a secondary current collector, thereby leading to higher utilization of the sulfur content and assisting in the redox mechanism of the LiPSs. The electrochemical performance of cells incorporating the modified separator was characterized by a low overpotential (in the case of Li-Li symmetrical cells) and high Coulombic efficiency and a low decay rate (in the LSB, simultaneously). The roll-to-roll sputtering of the thin layer of graphite on the pristine separator would appear to be a scalable solution for the commercialization of such modified separators.

Infiltrating sulfur in hierarchical architecture MWCNT@meso C core-shell nanocomposites for lithium-sulfur batteries	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							GRAPHENE OXIDE; CATHODE; COMPOSITES; PERFORMANCE; DISCHARGE; CAPACITY	We present hierarchical architecture MWCNT (multi-walled carbon nanotubes)@meso C core-shell nanostructures as a carbon matrix for effective trapping of sulfur/polysulfides as a cathode material for Li-S batteries. The unique structure of MWCNT@meso C core-shell nanocomposites was achieved by using a sol-gel coating method followed by nanocasting. By infiltrating sulfur into the matrix, S/MWCNT@meso C core-shell nanocomposites were achieved. This material exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1248 mA h g(-1) although it decayed to about 640 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles. However, this performance is much better than that of S directly deposited on MWCNT (S/MWCNT) which only retained a capacity of 120 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles. Our composite exhibited excellent rate capability even at a discharge current density of 2 A g(-1). The improvement in electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergetic effect between MWCNT cores, which provide electronic conduction pathways, and the mesoporous carbon shells with a relatively high surface area, which can trap sulfur/polysulfides and provide Li+ ion pathways.

During the past decades, many achievements have been obtained through great fundamental researches for inhibiting the shuttle effect, especially including designing various cathode materials and interlayers. As a result, the prepared coin cells in the references deliver a superior long-term cycling performance even for 1000 cycles. However, when facing the practical application of Li-S pouch cells, the poor cycle performance is still existed. This indicates that there is wide gap of scientific knowledge between the fundamental research and the application need. Herein, Li-S pouch cells are designed and used for exploring the key factors that influence the cycle life of the Li-S cell. We mainly discuss the influences of sulfur loading and electrolyte/sulfur ratio on the capacity contribution and cycle life. Combining electrochemical cycle performance and analysis for the Li-S pouch cells after dismantling, we propose two different capacity fading mechanisms for Li-S pouch cells with different E/S ratio (3, 10) and sulfur loading (5.8 mg cm(-2), 10.8 mg cm(-2)). In all, this work provides new understandings into the relationship between capacity fading and sulfur loading and electrolyte/sulfur ratio. This is beneficial for developing practical Li-S cell with high-energy density far exceed the traditional Li-ion cell.

Despite numerous nanomaterials have been explored, an effective approach to fabricate an ideal interlayer is still elusive. Herein, we developed a new electropolymerization strategy to grow in-situ a polycarbazole-type interlayer with a number of merits to boost the reversible capacity. Firstly, the membrane is microporous but compact with uniform 0.82 nm nanochannels that can effectively suppress the diffusion of polysulfide species. Secondly, using the CNT (700 nm) as conductive substrate, the electropolymerized membrane is ultrathin (60 nm), which facilitates fast transport of lithium ions and rate performance. Thirdly, the membrane is electron conductive (23 S m(-1)) that benefits the charge transfer and redox reaction. Li-S batteries configured with such an UCCM type of interlayer have showed enhanced sulfur utilization by threefold, with a reversible capacity of 920 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles at 0.2 C, and a high areal density of 10 mAh cm(-2) at 11.2 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading. A safer lithium-ion sulfur full-cell with lithiated graphite anode demonstrated a stable capacity over 4 mAh cm(-2) under a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of similar to 10 mu L mg(-1).

To realize the ultimate performance of such batteries, the effect of all structural components of the batteries has to be considered. Nowadays the effect of current collectors appears to be less explored in the battery research field. Therefore, this report draws attention to exploit different current collectors such as, copper, aluminum, platinum, and nickel. It is found that nickel has a profound effect on the performance of the lithium-sulfur batteries by direct involvement in electrochemical reaction with soluble polysulfides leading to the formation of nickel sulfide. The formation of such unwanted species can be reduced dramatically by silane-surface modification. Aluminum and platinum, on the other hand, have been found to be the most inert collector toward the cycle performance because of nonreactivity within the potential window.

However, the shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), sluggish reaction kinetics, and uncontrollable Li-dendrite growth severely degrade the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. Herein, a dual-functional flexible free-standing carbon nanofiber conductive framework in situ embedded with TiN-VN heterostructures (TiN-VN@CNFs) as an advanced host simultaneously for both the sulfur cathode (S/TiN-VN@CNFs) and the lithium anode (Li/TiN-VN@CNFs) is designed. As cathode host, the TiN-VN@CNFs can offer synergistic function of physical confinement, chemical anchoring, and superb electrocatalysis of LiPS redox reactions. Meanwhile, the well-designed host with excellent lithiophilic feature can realize homogeneous lithium deposition for suppressing dendrite growth. Combined with these merits, the full battery (denoted as S/TiN-VN@CNFs || Li/TiN-VN@CNFs) exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties including high reversible capacity of 1110 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and ultralong cycle life over 600 cycles at 2 C. Even with a high sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm(-2), the full cell can achieve a high areal capacity of 5.5 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C. This work paves a new design from theoretical and experimental aspects for fabricating high-energy-density flexible Li-S full batteries.

Herein, a modified template method is proposed to synthesize the robust yolk-shell sulfur host that is constructed by enveloping dispersive Fe2O3 nanoparticles within Mn3O4 nanosheet-grafted hollow N-doped porous carbon capsules (Fe2O3@N-PC/Mn3O4-S). When applied as a cathode for Li-S batteries, the as-prepared Fe2O3@N-PC/Mn3O4-S can deliver capacities as high as 1122 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and 639 mAh g(-1) after 1500 cycles at 10 C, respectively. Remarkably, even as the areal sulfur loading is increased to 5.1 mg cm(-2), the cathode can still maintain a high areal specific capacity of 5.08 mAh cm(-2) with a fading rate of only 0.076% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.1 C. By a further combination analysis of electron holography and electron energy loss spectroscopy, the outstanding performance is revealed to be mainly traced to the oxygen-vacancy-induced interfacial charge field, which immobilizes and catalyzes the conversion of lithium polysulfides, assuring low polarization, fleet redox reaction kinetics, and sufficient utilization of sulfur. These new findings may shed light on the dependence of electrochemical performance on the heterostructure of sulfur hosts.

Design of versatile strategies is still desperately needed for facilitating the kinetic process of LiPSs conversion. Herein, we report an intuitive method, strain regulation, for improving the electrocatalytic performances of MXene for LiPSs conversion. The imported strain triggers the distortion of TiC3O3 octahedron configuration and the downshift of the d-band center, which facilitates the charge transfer and conversion of LiPSs on MXene. Under the guidance of the simulations, the strain-induced wrinkle flower-shaped MXene is adopted to verify the effect of strains on the conversion efficiency of sulfur. The experiments prove that the conversion rate of LiPSs and the long cycle stability of batteries were enhanced by the strained MXene. Our first principle simulations and experiments demonstrate that the introduction of strain is viable and capable of providing a new paradigm for developing high-performance Li-S batteries.

To address these issues, we propose a strategy to suppress the shuttle effect by constructing freestanding N-doped carbon nanofibers with well-distributed conductive Mo2C nanoparticles (Mo2C-NCNFs) as 3D current collectors for Li-S batteries. DFT calculations demonstrate that the Mo2C possesses strong and stable adsorption affinity to LiPSs, thus effectively alleviating the shuttle effect. The 3D interconnected nanofibers possess the advantages of high electronic conductivity, structural integrity, fast electrochemical reaction kinetics, and very few dead volumes from inactive additives. As a result, a promising electrochemical performance with a good combination of high specific capacity of 1086 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, extremely stable cycling performance of over 250 cycles without obvious capacity fading. This strategy is enlightening in designing high performance electrodes for Li-S batteries.

Based on the idea of waiving the use of concentrated alkali and specialty gases, we demonstrate herein a highly efficient and previously unreported method of CC activation with a two-step procedure: homogeneous growth of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) on CC and subsequent activation catalyzed by the MOF derivatives. During pyrolysis, the MOF structures are transformed into Co3O4 particles, which react with carbon, leading to etching of the carbon fiber. This method can be used to form activated CC with coexistence of micropores, meso-pores, and macropores. With the benefit of such hierarchical and unique structures, a free-standing sulfur-impregnated porous CC electrode demonstrates obvious advantages over CC-supported sulfur melt or sulfur slurry electrodes, which demonstrates great feasibility of MOF catalyzing porosification of CC for practical applications. This reported method not only broadens the scope of application of MOFs, it could also be further used to create hierarchical structures on other carbonaceous materials in various fields.

However, its fabrication as well as realizing high electrochemical utilization and stability with high-loading sulfur cathodes is a daunting challenge. We present here a new pie-like electrode that consists of an electrocatalytic nickel-foam as a "filling" to adsorb and store polysulfide catholytes and an outer carbon shell as a "crust" for facilitating high-loading sulfur cathodes with superior electrochemical and structural stabilities. The inner electrocatalytic nickel-foam is configured to adsorb polysulfides and facilitate their redox reactions. The intertwined carbon shell assists to shield the polysulfides within the cathode region of the cell. Both the nickel-foam and the carbon shell have high conductivity and porous space, which serve simultaneously as interconnected current collectors to enhance the redox kinetics and as polysulfide reservoirs to confine the active material. The effectiveness of such a pie-like structure in improving the electrochemical efficiency enables the cathode to host an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 40 mg cm(-2) and attain a high areal capacity of over 40 mA h cm(-2) at a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 7. The enhanced cyclability is reflected in a high reversible areal capacity approaching 30 mA h cm(-2) at C/5 rate after 100 cycles and excellent rate capability up to 2C rate.

To this end, unlike conventional approaches to control the pore of carbon hosts, we demonstrate controlling the interfacial energy of the solution in the process of penetrating the sulfur-dissolved solution. We un-veil, experimentally and theoretically, that the interfacial energy with the carbon surface of the sulfur solution is the key to driving complete encapsulation of sulfur. In the infiltration of sulfur solu-tions with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, we achieve complete encapsu-lation of sulfur, even up to 85 wt %. The sulfur fully encapsulated cathode achieves markedly high volumetric capacity and stable cycle operation in its Li-S battery applications. We achieve a vol-umetric capacity of 855 mAh/cm(3) at 0.2C and a capacity reduction of 0.071% per cycle up to 300 cycles at 1C.

In this work, double transition metal oxide TiNb2O7 (TNO) nanometer particles are tactfully deposited on the surface of an activated carbon cloth (ACC), activating the surface through a hydrothermal reaction and high-temperature calcination and finally forming the flexible self-supporting architecture as an effective catalyst for sulfur conversion reaction. It has been found that ACC@TNO possesses many catalytic activity sites, which can inhibit the shuttle effect of LiPSs and increase the Coulombic efficiency by boosting the redox reaction kinetics of LiPS transformation reaction. As a consequence, the ACC@TNO/S cathode exhibits an impressive electrochemical performance, including a high initial discharge capacity of 885 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 1 C, a high discharge specific capacity of 825 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles with a prominent capacity retention rate of 93%, and a small decay rate of 0.034% per cycle. Although TNO is extensively used in the fields of lithium ion batteries and other rechargeable batteries, it is first introduced as sulfur host materials to boost the redox reaction kinetics of the LiPS transformation reaction and increase the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. Therefore, studies of the synergistic effect on the chemical absorption and catalytic conversion effect of TNO for LiPSs of Li-S batteries provide a good strategy for boosting further the comprehensive electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries.

The morphological, microstructural, thermal and electrochemical properties of the composite electrodes were analyzed. TG curves indicated high thermal stability, which confirmed the strong bonding between sulfur and carbon host. It was found from electrochemical studies that the equal weight ratio of S and MWCNT (S2) composite electrode led to high electrochemical performances compared to other composite electrodes. It delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1414 mAh/g at 0.1C and also even at high current density, i.e., 413 mAh/g at 3C.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries are seriously impeded by the sluggish conversion reaction from Li2S2 to Li2S. The solution of this problem relies on comprehensive understanding of Li2S2 conversion mechanisms. Herein, a theoretical model is established by generalizing the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach. More specifically, Li2S2 conversion is redefined in elementary steps that includes the participation of each electron. Associative and dissociative reaction mechanisms with electrocatalysts are proposed and inspected by the free energy criterion. Single atom catalysts containing Fe, Co, Ni, and V are discussed separately. The effects of applied electrode potential are accurately described by the generalized CHE approach. It is predicted that associative reaction mechanism can provide the highest electrode potential with the existence of Fe single atom catalysts. Analysis on electronic structures further confirms the electrocatalysis activity originates from the chemical bonds between S and transition metal atoms. This work unveils the Li2S2 conversion mechanisms in elementary steps. More importantly, the generalized CHE approach opens a new frontier of exploration on redox reactions in Li-S battery and hopefully other energy storage systems.

A highly sulfur (S) loaded (75 wt%) carbon matrix (S/nitrogen rich carbon host matrix (NGC)) has been designed, with hierarchically organized micro/mesopore structures containing nitrogen and oxygen functional groups, and using metal oxide nanostructured templates. The S/NGC electrodes give reversible capacities of 868 and 666 mAh g(-1) at C/5 current rates, with sulfur loading of 2.2 and 3.4 mg cm(-2), respectively. Based on the advantages of the hierarchically organized porous structure and heteroatom doping, S/NGC electrode shows long cycling stability (0.03% capacity decay per cycle in the first 1000 cycles) with high coulombic efficiency (>99%), which is an improvement by a factor of two compared with a sulfur/graphene cathode. Further, the charge/discharge mechanism of the cell is investigated in detail by in situ Raman and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The presence of nitrogen on the carbon support is found to make the bond formation easier between sulfur and oxygen functional groups existing at the carbon support, which is supposed to play a major role along with hierarchically organized porous structure, for the prevention of sulfur/polysulfides species dissolution to the anode side.

However, the unresolved "shuttle effect" limits the practical performance. The conventional strategies to inhibit lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttles including physical blocking and chemical anchoring are easy to hit the ceiling, which is mainly due to the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Herein, we report a self-standing nitrogen-doped carbonized cotton cloth (N-CCC) interlayer with macroscopic knitted structure and microscopic carbon microtubes for confining-trapping-catalyzing LiPS simultaneously. In situ/Operando characterization (including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, shuttle current measurement and Raman spectroscopy) and theoretical calculation synergistically demonstrate that the multifunctional active sites of Pyrrolic N and Pyridinic N on N-CCC accelerate catalytic reaction kinetics and inhibit the "shuttle effect". With the multifunctional N-CCC interlayer, a high capacity of 998 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and high stability with a retention of 76% after 400 cycles are realized. Moreover, N-CCC based LSBs display competitive performance even at high current density (596 mAh g(-1) @10 C) and high sulfur loading (795 mAh g(-1) @4 mg cm(-2) at 1 C). This research demonstrates a rational mechanism analysis for sulfur redox kinetics for practical high-energy/power density LSBs.

Nevertheless, the notorious lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics result in inferior electrochemical performances, which are the major obstacles to their commercial application. Engineering the surface/interface of the ultrafine polysulfide promotor which can accelerate LiPS conversion and improve sulfur utilization is still challenging. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to synthesize ultrafine heterostructural Nb2O5-NbC homogeneously distributed in a carbon nanofiber matrix. Polystyrene (PS), as the nanocrystallite growth modulator, plays a vital role in suppressing particle agglomeration. The in situ formed heterostructures with a rational interface engineering design can achieve effective LiPS regulation and speed up the redox kinetics, as confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental characterizations. As expected, the battery containing ultrafine Nb2O5-NbC heterostructures delivers long-term cyclability with a low capacity decay of 0.044% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1.0C. And the decay rate is as low as 0.045% after 250 cycles at 0.5C with a sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm(-2). This work provides a rational way to prepare ultrafine heterostructural polysulfide promotors via engineering the interface design for Li-S batteries.

Herein, a novel type of sulfur cathode substrate is established via a facile two-step process, in which the Co and CoP nanoparticles are embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) porous nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedron (Co/CoP@NC). These Co and CoP nanograins not only act as polysulfides capturing centers but also the electrocatalysts effectively promoting the redox kinetics towards polysulfides conversion, as confirmed by the experimental results and DFT calculations. Meanwhile, the interconnected 3D porous N-doped carbon architecture contributed to Li+ transportation, electrolyte infiltration and relieves volume expansion of sulfur. Thus, Li-S batteries configured with the S@Co/CoP@NC cathode exhibit a remarkable enhancement in the rate capability and cycling performances. When sulfur content is controlled to be 75.8 wt%, the S@Co/CoP@NC cathode delivers an outstanding high-rate capability up to 30 C and low capacity decay rates of 0.033% and 0.03% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C and 2 C, respectively.

Herein, we present a porous multi-walled ZnCo2O4 sphere prepared by a self-reduction approach as sulfur host for LiS battery cathode. During the annealing of an inorganic-organic hybrid precursor, ZnCo2O4 spheres are partially reduced by the released carbon monoxide, resulting in the formation of ZnO and CoO nanoparticles which are subsequently etched by acid, finally forming mesopores throughout the multi-walled ZnCo2O4 spheres. The multi-walled ZnCo2O4 provides sufficient space for accommodating the volumetric change of sulfur. The adsorption measurements show that the multi-walled ZnCo2O4 can adsorb the polysulfides efficiently, which suppresses the shuttle effect. After cycling 1000 times at a rate of 0.5C, the multi-walled ZnCo2O4@S composite remains a capacity of 590 mAh g(-1). The rate-performance is well recoverable during repeated tests. Moreover, the capacities at relatively low and high temperatures of - 5 and 50 degrees C are 654 and 619 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, respectively, indicating a potential for applications	[Zhong, Yan; Han, Tianli; Cheng, Mengying; Deng, Lin; Liu, Jinyun] Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Anhui Prov Engn Lab New Energy Vehicle Battery En, Wuhu 241002, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Hu, Chaoquan] Nanjing IPE Inst Green Mfg Ind, Nanjing 211100, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hu, Chaoquan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, State Key Lab Multiphase Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [He, Qiya; Zhang, Huigang] Nanjing Univ, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Natl Lab Solid State Microstruct, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China		Liu, JY (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Anhui Prov Engn Lab New Energy Vehicle Battery En, Wuhu 241002, Anhui, Peoples R China.; Hu, CQ (corresponding author), Nanjing IPE Inst Green Mfg Ind, Nanjing 211100, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Hu, CQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, State Key Lab Multiphase Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.	cqhu@ipe.ac.cn; jyliu@ahnu.edu.cn	Zhang, Huigang/D-7684-2013	Zhang, Huigang/0000-0002-4722-5384	Science and Technology Major Project of Anhui Province [18030901093]; Key Research and Development Program of Wuhu [2019YF07]; Natural Science Research Project for Universities in Anhui Province [KJ2018ZD034, KJ2019A0502]; Anhui Provincial Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Returnees from Overseas [2019LCX005]	Science and Technology Major Project of Anhui Province; Key Research and Development Program of Wuhu; Natural Science Research Project for Universities in Anhui Province; Anhui Provincial Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Returnees from Overseas	This work was supported by the Science and Technology Major Project of Anhui Province (18030901093), Key Research and Development Program of Wuhu (2019YF07), Natural Science Research Project for Universities in Anhui Province (KJ2018ZD034, KJ2019A0502), Anhui Provincial Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Returnees from Overseas (2019LCX005).		57	4	4	2	16	ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA	LAUSANNE	PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND	1572-6657	1873-2569		J ELECTROANAL CHEM	J.

As a result, the sulfur-containing cathode with the barrier layer reaches an initial reversible specific capacity of 1090.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, with the capacity retention of 93.1% after 150 cycles and the coulombic efficiency above 99%.

Moreover, the AEG flakes facilitated ionic and electronic transfer during the redox reaction. Live H-cell discharging experiments revealed that the modified separator was effective at curbing polysulfide shuttling; moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the cycled separator confirmed the presence of lithium polysulfides in the AEG/CH matrix. Using this dual functional interaction approach, the lifetime of the pure sulfur-based cathode was extended to 3000 cycles at 1C-rate (1C = 1670 mA/g), decreasing the decay rate to 0.021% per cycle, a value that is among the best reported to date. A flexible battery based on this modified separator exhibited stable performance and could turn on multiple light-emitting diodes. Such modified membranes with good mechanical strength, high electronic conductivity, and anti-self-discharging shield appear to be a scalable solution for future high-energy battery systems.

The sulfur cathode (S cathode) comprises sulfur, carbon powder, and a polymer binder. Polyethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA-x) with different degrees of saponification (x%) are used as binders to prepare the composite cathodes. For the Li-S cell containing PEO binder, lithium polysulfides (Li2Sm, 2 <= m <= 8), reaction intermediates of the S cathode, dissolve into the electrolyte, and Li2Sm acts as a redox shuttle in the Li-S cell. In contrast, in the Li-S cell with PVA-x binder, the dissolution of Li2Sm is suppressed, leading to high columbic efficiencies during charge-discharge cycles. The compatibility of the PVA-x binder with the SIL electrolyte changes depending on the degree of saponification. Decreasing the degree of saponification leads to increased electrolyte uptake by the PVA-x binder, increasing the charge and discharge capacities of Li-S cell. The rate capability of Li-S cell is also enhanced by the partial swelling of the PVA-x binder. The enhanced performance of Li-S cell containing PVA-x is attributed to the lowering of resistance of Li+ ion transport in the composite cathode. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The limitations to commercialize Li-S batteries originate from the intrinsic properties of sulfur: its poor electronic conductivity and the polysulfide shuttling effect. The aim of this research is to address these challenges by developing an additive for Li-S batteries. Aluminum (Al) powders prepared from soda cans were mixed with sulfur to form a composite with a sulfur mass loading up to 90 wt%. The electrochemical performance shows that the Al-S composite in Li-S cells exhibits a stable retention after 200 cycles and an ability to stabilize quickly (< 10 cycles). Moreover, the rate performance of the Al-S composite is improved over conventional carbon additives. Post analysis suggests that Al-S surface interaction is a possible origin for this improvement.

Molecular dynamics calculations and experimental analyses reveal the formation of PSs upon dissolution of elemental S in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) at elevated temperatures and efficient infiltration of the PSs into the carbon host driven by the strong coupling with the C surfaces. The coupling enables extensive contact between S and C in the composite, leading to promising electrochemical properties for Li-S battery applications. In the power-type configuration, the composite cathodes having medium-to-high S contents (55 and 75%) demonstrate stable capacity at high current densities up to 100C (1C = 1670 mA g(-1).S) and no capacity fade up to 1000 cycles at 2C. In the energy-type configuration, a high-S-content and high-loading (90%-S, 4.2 mAh cm(-2)) cathode shows a specific capacity of 1440 mAh g(-1) (86% S utilization) and 90% capacity retention after 300 cycles. This synthesis method enables significant advancement in realizing large-scale applications of Li-S batteries.

In the analysis using the prepared specimen of S-AC composite by the focused ion beam (FIB) technique, the elemental sulfur exists in a highly dispersed state inside the micropores of activated carbon, which has a large surface area and a narrow pore distribution. The S-AC composite was characterized through X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, selected area electron diffraction (SAED), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A lithium-sulfur cell using the S-AC composite has a high first discharge capacity over 800 mA h g(-1) S even at a high current density such as 2C (3200 mA g(-1) S) and has good cycleability around 500 mA h g(-1) S discharge capacity at the 50th cycle at the same current density.

Most recently, metal oxides are applied for inhibiting this shuttle effect. In our work, mesoporous Ti4O7/S composites are prepared and employed into Li-S battery. The mesoporous Ti4O7 layer in the Ti4O7/S composites could provide both physical absorption and chemical bond between the polysulfide and cathode material. As a result, the electrochemical results show that the Ti4O7/S composites have excellent cycle stability and high specific capacity. This excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the presence of Ti4O7 layer in the composite.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer a promising alternative to lithiumion batteries owing to their substantially higher specific capacity and energy density. However, improvements to Li-S systems are still needed in low-temperature environments where polysulfide clustering and solubility limitations prohibit complete charge/discharge cycles. We address these issues by introducing thiophosphate-functionalized metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), capable of tethering polysulfides, into the cathode architecture. Compared to cells with the parent MOFs, cells containing the functionalized MOFs exhibit greater capacity delivery and decreased polarization for a range of temperatures down to -10 degrees C. We conduct thorough electrochemical analyses to ascertain the origins of performance differences and report an altered Li-S redox mechanism enabled by the thiophosphate moiety.

Notwithstanding the recent progress, the problematic polysulfide shuttling, retarded sulfur redox, and low output of volumetric capacity remain daunting challenges toward its practicability. In response, this work demonstrates herein a universal approach to in situ craft MOx-MXene (M: Ti, V, and Nb) heterostructures as heavy and multifunctional hosts to harvest good battery performances with synchronous polysulfide immobilization and conversion. Theoretical calculations indicate that the in situ implanted oxides boost the reaction kinetics of polysulfide transformation without affecting the intrinsic conductivity of MXene. As a result, the representative VOx-V2C/S electrode enables a high volumetric capacity (offering 1645.98 mAh cm(-3) at 0.2 C) and cycling stability (retaining 631.17 mAh cm(-3) after 1500 cycles at 2.0 C with a capacity decay of 0.03% per cycle). More encouragingly, 3D-printed sulfur electrodes harnessing VOx-V2C hosts readily harvest an areal capacity of 9.74 mAh cm(-2) at 0.05 C under an elevated sulfur loading of 10.78 mg cm(-2), holding promise for the development of practically viable Li-S batteries.

The sulfur host material typically contains a metal oxide which is active for polysulfide adsorption and/or conversion, and a chemically inactive conductive support for the transport of electrons away from the active sites. Most current research is focused on the interaction between polysulfides and the composite; little is done on how such interaction may be modulated by using a conductive and chemically active support in the composite. In principle, the interface between a chemically active support and metal oxide has the potential to alter the electron distribution on the polysulfide active sites, thereby altering the latter's ability to adsorb and transform polysulfides. In this study, MnOx/MXene composites were used as a model system using the chemical activity of MXene to invoke an interfacial interaction with manganese oxide. Sulfur cathodes compounded with the MnOx/MXene composite (MnOx/MXene/S) showed improved high-rate performance (697.8 mAh g-1 at 5C) and cycling stability (fade rate of 0.027% per cycle at 3C for 1000 cycles). The oxide-support interaction in MnOx/MXene is therefore advantageous to polysulfide reutilization in Li-S batteries.

The binding of Li2Sx to N-doped graphene was significantly stronger than that to solvents, such as 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), approximately by 0.5-3.0 eV, indicating that N-doped graphenes possessed the ability to trap soluble Li2Sx. The binding of Li2Sx to N-doped graphenes followed the order of pyrrolic N > pyridinic N > graphene > graphitic N. Among them, pyrrolic N exhibited the strongest anchoring effect mainly via forming the coordination bond of LiN3. In addition, in all the investigated systems, the van der Waals force also played an important role in binding. We comprehensively analyzed the micro-nano-scale theoretical data, including charge, bond distance, bond order, electron density difference, the electron localization function (ELF), and the independent gradient model (IGM) of the Li ion and N atom. The strength of the Li-N bond confirmed that the strongest anchoring occurred when the Li ion was trapped above the vacancy-forming coordination bond rather than a regular covalent bond. Although the strength of Li-N binding had a direct effect on the binding energy, other thermodynamic parameters (free energy and dissociation energy) of catalytic conversion and the energy barrier of Li2S phase transformation also showed a similar capacity.

However, the cell using S/PAN composite as a cathode material exhibits sluggish reaction kinetics due to the low conductivity. Moreover, capacity fading is also found in long-term cycle test and the mechanism is not well studied in previous reports. In this work, a compact composite, S/PAN confined in macro-porous carbon (MaPC), is firstly prepared by using a sulfur copolymer to improve the cycle stability. The cathode shows stable cycle stability during the initial 150 cycles at the current density of 1050 mA gsulfur-1 and the capacity maintained at 806 mAh gsulfur-1 . The cycle stability is getting worse during the long-term cycle test. It is found that the capacity fading is highly related to the increasing resistance and the formation of sulfates or sulfate-like components during the repeated cycling process.

A feasible vacuum soaking step was introduced to absorb the sulfur source (Na2Sx) into the carbon micropores/mesopores. It is confirmed from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), galvanostatic discharge-charge, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) that the S/C composite with vacuum soaking (78 wt% sulfur) leads to more dispersion of sulfur into the carbon micropores/mesopores and displays better electrochemical features, compared to the S/C composite without vacuum soaking, the synthesized sulfur/carbon and pristine sulfur/carbon ball-milled composites. The S/C cathode with vacuum soaking delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1116.1 mAh g(-1) (based on sulfur weight) and retains 534.2 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles with a discharge/charge rate of 0.35 C. The stable capacity retention and sturdy structure of the electrode are attributed to an intimate nanoscale contact established between the smaller sized sulfur and the conductive carbon.

Here we present an integrated sulfur cathode design on tortuosity and sulfur-binding affinity parameters for mitigating diffusion loss of sulfur-based active materials. The high sulfur-philicity property (from oxygen functional groups, 16% in concentration) in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) host favors bonding with sulfur species to mitigate their diffusion/dissolution loss, while the high tortuosity (13.24, from horizontal arrangement of rGO sheets) can localize the soluble active materials within the host rather than outward diffusion loss with subsequent uneven redeposition. With this integrated concept, we achieved ultrahigh cathode areal capacities of 21 mAh cm(-2) with 98.1% retention after 160 cycles, surpassing those electrodes with lower tortuosity and sulfur-philicity. In addition, same rGOhost suppresses dendrite growth in Li anode, enabling 278% prolonged cycle life in the full cell.

However, it remains an enormous challenge to realize high utilizations and loadings of sulfur in cathodes for the practical applications of Li-S batteries. Herein, we design a quasi-2D Co@N-C composite with honeycomb architecture as a multifunctional sulfur host via a simple sacrificial templates method. The cellular flake with large surface area and honeycomb architecture can encapsulate much more sulfur, leading to high sulfur content (HSC) composites, and by stacking these HSC flakes, a high sulfur loading (HSL) electrode can be realized due to their high layer bulk density. Compared to our previous work in multifunctional Co-N-C composites, the cellular Co@N-C composite displays a distinct enhancement in the sulfur content, sulfur loading, cycle stability, and rate performance. Benefiting from the cellular morphology, a composite with an HSC of 93.6 wt % and an electrode with an HSL of 7.5 mg cm(-2) can be obtained simultaneously, which exhibited excellent rate performance up to 10 C (3.6 mg cm(-2)) and great cycling stability.

J	Fan, FY; Chiang, YM				Fan, Frank Y.; Chiang, Yet-Ming			Electrodeposition Kinetics in Li-S Batteries: Effects of Low Electrolyte/Sulfur Ratios and Deposition Surface Composition	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; SOL-GEL PROCESS; THIN-FILMS; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROCRYSTALLIZATION; SPECTROSCOPY; NUCLEATION; CHEMISTRY; REDOX	Lithium-sulfur batteries obtain most of their capacity from the electrodeposition of Li2S. This is often a slow process, limiting the rate capability of Li-S batteries. In this work, the kinetics of Li2S deposition from polysulfide solutions of 1-7 M S concentration onto carbon and two conductive oxides (indium tin oxide, ITO; and aluminum-doped zinc oxide, AZO) were characterized. Higher polysulfide concentrations were found to result in significantly slower electrodeposition, with island nucleation and growth rates up to 75% less than at low concentrations. Since Li-S batteries with low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios necessarily reach higher polysulfide concentrations during use, the present results explain why high polarization and low rate capability are observed under such conditions. Given that low E/S ratios are critical to reach high energy density, means to improve electrodeposition kinetics at high polysulfide concentrations are necessary. Towards this goal, coatings of ITO and AZO on carbon fiber current collectors were found to improve island growth rates at 5 M by up to similar to 60%. Of the two oxides, AZO was found to be superior in reducing the electrodeposition overpotential. Its benefits were demonstrated for carbon fiber current collectors coated with AZO and for conductive suspensions incorporating carbon black and nanoparticle AZO. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

Graphene wraps around the activated carbon-sulphur hybrid to form a core-shell structure, in which the porous carbon framework stores most of the sulphur and the graphene layer suppresses the movement of the soluble polysulfide in the electrolyte during charge-discharge, resulting in an improvement of capacity and Cyclic stability during long-term cycling. Such a core-shell structure is formed by changing the hydrophilicity of graphene oxide during reduction, in which the hydrophobic graphene closely wraps around the hydrophobic carbon surface.

However, such reservoirs would in turn absorb excess electrolyte solvents to S-unfilled regions, causing the electrolyte overconsumption, specific energy decline, and even safety hazards for battery devices. To build better cathodes, we propose to substitute carbons by In-doped SnO2 (ITO) nano ceramics that own three-in-one functionalities: 1) using conductive ITO enables minimizing the total carbon content to an extremely low mass ratio (similar to 3%) in cathodes, elevating the electrode tap density and averting the electrolyte overuse; 2) polar ITO nanoclusters can serve as robust anchors toward Li polysulfide (LiPS) by electrostatic adsorption or chemical bond interactions; 3) they offer catalysis centers for liquid-solid phase conversions of S-based actives. Also, such ceramics are intrinsically nonflammable, preventing S cathodes away from thermal runaway or explosion. These merits entail our configured cathodes with high tap density (1.54 g cm(-3)), less electrolyte usage, good security for flame retardance, and decent Li-storage behaviors. With lean and LiNO3-free electrolyte, packed full cells exhibit excellent redox kinetics, suppressed LiPS shuttling, and excellent cyclability. This may trigger great research enthusiasm in rational design of low-carbon and safer S cathodes.

The present work therefore synthesizes, a cores-hell composite material having a sulfonated polyaniline shell, and a bamboo-derived porous carbon core loaded with sulfur. The thin, homogeneous shell has a thickness of approximately 20 nm. This composite is employed as a cathode material in Li-S batteries and the electrochemical properties of these devices are systematically investigated. This cathode (containing 64.0 wt% S) exhibits a higher initial discharge capacity (1484 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), improved cycling stability (853 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C), and remarkable rate performance (810.2, 682.7 and 353.0 mAh g(-1) at 2, 3 and 5 C, respectively). These values are superior to those obtained using a polyaniline shell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations are used to elucidate the internal mechanisms of the sulfonated polyaniline shell during cycling. The calculated results demonstrate that the shell possesses extremely high electron and Li ion conductivities, and so enhances the redox reaction kinetics during long-term cycling. It also physically confines and chemically anchors polysulfides, thus limiting the shuttle effect. This cathode design is expected to assist in the future commercialization of Li-S batteries.

In response to existing LSBs problems, facilitating the conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is considered an effective method, and the LiPSs conversion in the liquid phase provides the majority of the capacity of LSBs. Understanding the kinetics of redox processes of LiPSs in liquid-electrolyte LSBs is crucial. In this study, we have designed a new flowing electrolyte three-electrode system, equipped with a tiny H-type electrolytic cell isolated using the Nafion membrane, to quantitatively measure the intrinsic kinetics of LiPSs conversion. As a result, the onset redox potentials, exchange current densities, reaction orders, and apparent activation energy of the LiPSs conversion were obtained on the basis of the steady-state polarization curves. The onset reduction potentials of main LiPSs were 2.427, 2.348, 2.281, 2.212, and 2.139 V (vs Li+/Li) for S-8, Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4, and Li2S2, respectively. The calculated exchange current density of Li2S6 redox was the highest (188.55 mu A/cm(2)), while the S-8 reduction was the minimal (0.97 mu A/cm(2)). In addition, the reaction orders and apparent activation energies of Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4 were studied. The kinetic parameters obtained were related to the formation of the potential plateaus and the sloping regions, especially for the exchange current densities associated with LSBs charge/discharge process. These parameters were used to decipher the charge/discharge curves and CV profile of S-8 in detail. This study could assist in understanding of the LSBs reaction mechanism.

Herein, an electrochemical Li intercalation and exfoliation strategy is used to prepare 2D Sb2S3 nanosheets (SSNSs), which are incorporated onto a separator in LSBs as a new 2D coupling material for the first time. The cells containing a rationally designed separator which is coated with an SSNS/carbon nanotube (CNT) coupling layer deliver a much improved specific capacity with a remarkable 0.05% decay rate for over 200 cycles at a current density of 2 C. The capability of the SSNSs to entrap polysulfides through their favorable interfacial functionality and the high electrical conductivity of the CNT network facilitates recycling of active materials. The first-principle calculations verify the important roles of SSNSs, which demonstrate ideal binding strengths (1.33-2.14 eV) to entrap Li2Sx as well as a low-energy barrier (189 meV) for Li diffusion. These findings offer new insights into discovering novel coupling layers for high-performance LSBs and shed new light on the application of 2D layer-structured materials in energy storage systems.

However, the intrinsic insulating nature of sulfur requires triple-phase contact with an ionic conductor and an electronic conductor for electrochemical reactions, which decreases the amount of active surface and lowers the charge-transfer efficiency. In this work, a double-phase interface constructed from a mixed ionic/electronic conductor is proposed to enhance the solid-state electrochemical reaction of sulfur. By employing lithium lanthanum titanium oxide/carbon (LLTO/C) nanofibers with mixed ionic/electronic conductivity, enhanced charge-transfer behavior is realized at the sulfur-LLTO/C double-phase interface, compared to the traditional triple-phase interface. As a result, high sulfur utilization and excellent rate performance are achieved. And the facilitated charge transfer shows great potential to lower the operating temperature and improve the sulfur content for practical applications of ASSLSBs. Cycle performance is also enhanced due to the suppressed shuttle effect of polysulfides by the incorporation of the LLTO/C nanofibers.

Then sulfur was in-situ deposited on the CPs/GO composites in same solution. The component and structure of the composites were characterized by XPS, TGA, FTIR, SEM, TEM and electrochemical measurements. In this structure, the CPs nanostructures are believed to serve as a conductive matrix and an adsorbing agent, while the highly conductive GO will physically and chemically confine the sulfur and polysulfide within cathode. The PEDOT/GO@S composites with the sulfur content of 66.2 wt% exhibit a reversible discharge capacity of 800.2 mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, which is much higher than that of PANI/GO@S composites (599.1 mAhg(-1)) and PANI@S (407.2 mAhg(-1)). Even at a high rate of 4 C, the PEDOT/GO@S composites still retain a high specific capacity of 632.4 mAhg(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the commercial applications of sulfur cathodes are limited by the poor electronic/ionic conductivity of elemental sulfur and polysulfides, volume expansion of sulfur during the discharge process, and the high solubility of long-chain lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 <= n <= 8). Herein, we design a core-shell structure composed of active carbon (AC) and an amorphous carbon-coating layer to encapsulate the sulfur in the carbon matrix. The carbon-coating layer obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization of glucose can effectively entrap the polysulfides. Furthermore, the composite matrix provides a conducting framework serving as an electrochemical reaction chamber for the sulfur cathode. After wrapping AC-S with an amorphous carbon layer, the obtained composite cathode can effectively confine the polysulfides and buffer the volume change. Consequently, the resulting composite cathode possesses a high specific capacity, good rate capability, and stable cycling performance. At 0.2 A g(-1) current density, the as-prepared carbon-coated AC-S composite cathode shows a high specific discharge capacity of 1103 mA h g(-1). At a current density of 0.8 A g(-1) and 1.6 A g(-1), the composite cathode exhibits 75% capacity retention over 150 cycles. The Coulombic efficiency of the cell remains at approximately 95%.

Nevertheless, the practical application of LSBs is heavily impeded by the high electrolyte to sulfur ratio necessary for catholyte-type controlled mechanism battery systems and to prevent severe polysulfide shuttling effects. To achieve high specific energy LSBs, it is vital to reduce the electrolyte dosage and slow the lithium polysulfide shuttling. Herein, the quick ion conductor La0.56Li0.33TiO3 (LLTO) with a perovskite structure is prepared via a sol-gel and high-temperature calcination method and used for the first time as an absorbent for polysulfides owing to its charged characteristics and as a catalyst for the polysulfide conversion reaction due to its structural characteristics. It has been found that LLTO exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 2.94 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) and plays a significant electrocatalytic role in the redox reaction of polysulfides in LSBs under lean electrolyte conditions. The co-existence of lithiophilic (O) and sulfiphilic (Ti) sites in LLTO can lead to a favorable interfacial affinity toward lithium polysulfides. Therefore, LSBs containing LLTO can readily reduce the electrolyte/active material ratio, accelerate the reaction kinetics, suppress the polysulfide shuttling and significantly reduce the overpotential for the charge/discharge process. This consequently results in the improved electrochemical performances of LSBs in terms of rate capability and cycling stability. LSBs can deliver a high initial capacity of 800 mA h g(-1) at 0.8 mA cm(-2) with a challenging electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S) of 5 mu L-E mg(S)(-1) and an excellent capacity retention of 90.1% after 50 cycles under lean electrolyte conditions. Even at a higher current density of 2 mA cm(-2), an acceptable capacity of 452 mA h g(-1) can still be maintained, with a high coulombic efficiency of 96.7% after 100 cycles.

However, their practical applications are hindered by the capacity decay due to lithium polysulfide shuttle effect and sulfur volume expansion. Here, we design a S@hollow carbon with porous shell/MnOx(S@HCS/MnOx) cathode to accommodate and immobilize sulfur and polysulfides, and develop a non-destructive technique X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) to in situ visualize the volume expansion of Li-S cathode. The designed cathode achieves a specific capacity of similar to 1100 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with a fade rate of 0.18% per cycle over 300 cycles. The X-ray CT shows that only 16% volume expansion and 70% volume fraction of solid sulfur remaining in the S@HCS/MnOx cathode, superior to the commercial cathode with 40% volume expansion and 5% volume remaining of solid sulfur particles. This is the first reported visualization evidence for the effectiveness of hollow carbon structure in accommodating cathode volume expansion and immobilizing sulfur shuffling. X-ray CT can serve as a powerful in situ tool to trace the active materials and then feedback to the structure design, which helps develop efficient and reliable energy storage systems.

J	Sun, WH; Lu, YC; Huang, YQ				Sun, Wenhao; Lu, Yi-Chun; Huang, Yaqin			An effective sulfur conversion catalyst based on MnCo2O4.5 modified graphitized carbon nitride nanosheets for high-performance Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							POLYSULFIDE CONVERSION; LITHIUM; INTERLAYER; SEPARATOR; G-C3N4; FABRICATION; NETWORK; BARRIER	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries promise high theoretical specific energy density (2600 W h kg(-1)), low cost and eco-friendliness. However, their practical development is limited by the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we develop a sulfur conversion catalyst based on MnCo2O4.5 modified graphitized carbon nitride nanosheets (CNMCO) to enhance the LiPS immobilization and redox conversion for Li-S batteries. Benefiting from its dense nano-lamellar structure and polar surface, CNMCO synergistically serves as a physical impediment and allows chemical entrapment for LiPSs. In addition, CNMCO exhibits a high electrocatalytic activity towards LiPS conversion as well as Li2S nucleation and decomposition, which were revealed by cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory calculations. As a consequence, the cell with the multi-functional CNMCO/PP separator exhibits substantially improved electrochemical performance, achieving an enhanced rate capability of similar to 600 mA h g(-1) at 4C, and an outstanding cycling stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.032% per cycle for 500 cycles at 2C. This work reports an effective strategy to achieve the immobilization of LiPSs and effective catalytic redox conversion for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) and lithium-metal polysulfide (Li-MSx; M = Mo, V, Ti, etc.) batteries, the promising thin film electrodes are not possible yet because of low melting point of sulfur. Here, for the first time, we have developed amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) - carbon (Cy) composite thinfilms using a magnetron sputtering method with novel co-deposition of molybdenum metal and sulfur-carbon composite. The thin films were used as the free-standing cathode for Li-MSx cells that demonstrates excellent cycling performance and rate capability without any shuttle effect. The Li-MoSx cells exhibit a high arealcapacity of 115 mu Ah/cm2 at the current density of 20 mu A/cm2, an excellent stability of 500 cycles and remarkable rate capability with no traces of shuttle effect. Density functional theory (DFT)-Molecular dynamics (MD) based calculations reveal the insertion of lithium via an optimal mix of conversion and intercalation reactions without breaking the base Mo-Sx structure, eliminating the shuttle effect, and producing stable cycling performance.

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides, electrical insulation and volume-change of sulfur, remain great challenges. Herein, inspired from a natural mimosa pudica structure, we present a novel nanocomposite which consists of a mimosa pudica-structured carbon matrix coating with sulfur. The biomimetic configuration is able to structurally-respond to the volume-change of sulfur during charge/discharge; and the carbon matrix provides a good conductivity for rapid electron transfer. The carbon/sulfur composite-based Li-S batteries exhibit a good electrochemical performance including a stable capacity after 1000 cycles, along with a Coulombic efficiency as high as 99.6 %, and an excellent rate-performance even after three rounds of measurements. In addition, the density function theory modeling is investigated, which confirms the adsorption effect of carbon towards the polysulfides including Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8, enabling a long-term cycling stability.

As a promising active material for metal-sulfur batteries, sulfur is of great interest due to its high-energy-density and abundance. However, there is a lack of industry-friendly and low-carbon fabrication strategies for high-performance sulfur-based active particles, which, however, is in critical need by their practical success. Herein, based on a hail-inspired sulfur nano-storm (HSN) technology developed in our lab, we report an energy-saving, solvent-free strategy for producing core-shell sulfur/carbon electrode particles (CNT@AC-S) in minutes. The fabrication of the CNT@AC-S electrode particles only involves low-cost sulfur blocks, commercial carbon nanotubes (CNT) and activated carbon (AC) micro-particles with high specific surface area. Based on the above core-shell CNT@AC-S particles, sulfur cathode with a high sulfur-loading of 9.2 mg cm(-2) delivers a stable area capacity of 6.6 mAh cm(-2) over 100 cycles. Furthermore, even for sulfur cathode with a super-high sulfur content (72 wt% over the whole electrode), it still delivers a high area capacity of 9 mAh cm(-2) over 50 cycles in a quasi-lean electrolyte condition. In a nutshell, this study brings a green and industryfriendly fabrication strategy for cost-effective production of rationally designed S-rich electrode particles.

The effect of a solid electrolyte interphase on the mechanism of operation of lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							IONIC-LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; MICROPOROUS CARBON; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; COMPOSITE CATHODES; PERFORMANCE; MOLECULES; SALT	Composite sulfur-carbon electrodes were prepared by encapsulating sulfur into the micropores of highly disordered microporous carbon with micrometer-sized particles. The galvanostatic cycling performance of the obtained electrodes was studied in 0.5 M Li bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI) in methylpropyl pyrrolidinium (MPP) FSI ionic-liquid (IL) electrolyte solution. We demonstrated that the performance of Li-S cells is governed by the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the initial discharge at potentials lower than 1.5 V vs. Li/Li+. Subsequent galvanostatic cycling is characterized by a one plateau voltage profile specific to the quasi-solid-state reaction of Li ions with sulfur encapsulated in the micropores under solvent deficient conditions. The stability of the SEI thus formed is critically important for the effective desolvation of Li ions participating in quasi-solid-state reactions. We proved that realization of the quasi-solid-state mechanism is controlled not by the porous structure of the carbon host but rather by the nature of the electrolyte solution composition and the discharge cut off voltage value. The cycling behavior of these cathodes is highly dependent on sulfur loading. The best performance at 30 degrees C can be achieved with electrodes in which the sulfur loading was 60% by weight, when sulfur filled micropores are not accessible for N-2 molecules according to gas adsorption isotherm data. A limited contact of the confined sulfur with the electrolyte solution results in the highest reversible capacity and initial coulombic efficiency. This insight into the mechanism provides a new approach to the development of new electrolyte solutions and additives for Li-S cells.

Benefiting from the high conductivity of graphene and the strong chemical bonding between polar MoS2 and polysulfides, the MoS2 graphene composites not only ensure unimpeded electrical conducting to the insulating sulfur but also effectively entrap polysulfides therein. The ex situ study further reveals that the MoS2 graphene composites enable spatially regulated Li2S deposition by the preferential deposition of solid Li2S product onto the polar MoS2 layers, making a large amount of fast electron transport paths exposed on graphene for further sulfur reduction. Therefore, the obtained MoS2 sulfur graphene nanocomposites present excellent rate performance and cycling stability with high reversible capacities of 895 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles and 524 mA h g(-1) at 1 C after 200 cycles. These encouraging results suggest that the layer-structured sulfur cathode materials through the rational integration of 2D polar and nonpolar amphoteric surfaces would be a promising strategy for enhancing the electrochemical performances of advanced Li S batteries.

The key issues are the severe shuttling of polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics. Herein, we report a novel metal-organic framework-derived Co2P-ZnS/ZnS-C nanocomposite constructed from inner Co2P-ZnS and outer ZnS-C heterostructures. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrated that these dual electrocatalytic heterostructures enabled strong affinity with polysulfides and facilitated the reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, the hollow carbon polyhedron provided fast electron/ion transfer channels and effectively buffered volume expansion during cycling. As anticipated, a high initial capacity of 1503 mA h g(-1) was achieved at 0.2C with Co-Zn/Zn-C/S as a cathode, together with excellent stability after 500 cycles at 1C. Even a high reversible capacity of 540 mA h g(-1) was achieved at 1C after 200 cycles under an elevated sulfur loading of 3.65 mg cm(-2). This work presents a new strategy for designing dual electrocatalytic hosts for immobilization and conversion of polysulfides, which may offer more opportunities as cathodes in stable Li-S batteries with high energy density.

Great efforts have been made to prepare carbon/TMDs, especially graphene/TMDs heterostructures as the cathodes of Li-S batteries. Recently, ReS2 shows a new 1T' phase and great potential in Li-S batteries because of its stable structure and a large amount of catalytic active sites. Herein, we prepared a new ReS2 nanosheets anchored on rGO (rGO/1T'-ReS2) composite as a lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) immobilizer and electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. The unique pore structure and rGO incorporation can effectively mitigate volume expansion and enhance electronical conductivity. Moreover, the novel 1T' phase of ReS2 shows both efficient chemical adsorption function and large electrocatalytic active sites of LiPSs. These advantages have been demonstrated by both characterization techniques and theoretical calculations. As a result, the rGO/1T'-ReS2/S nanosheets display significantly enhanced coulombic efficiency, rate performance and cycling stability compared with the rGO/S nanosheets and the rGO/1T'-ReS2/S nanospheres.

Herein, elaborately designed WSe2 flakelets immobilized on N-doped graphene (WSe2/NG) with abundant active sites are employed to be a dual-functional host for satisfying both the S cathode and Li anode synchronously. On the S cathode, the WSe2/NG with a strong interaction towards LiPSs can act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of LiPSs. On the Li anode, the WSe2/NG with excellent lithiophilic features can regulate the uniform Li plating/stripping to mitigate the growth of Li dendrite. Taking advantage of these merits, the assembled Li-S full batteries exhibit remarkable rate performance and stable cycling stability even at a higher sulfur loading of 10.5 mg cm(-2) with a negative to positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio of 1.4 : 1.

Here, we developed Co3O4/CoO/graphene nanosheets (GNS)/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanocomposite-based sulfur as cathodes for Li-S batteries. Due to the synergistic effects of GNS/h-BN and Co3O4/CoO, the reported Co3O4/CoO/GNS/h-BN nanocomposites not only effectively trap lithium polysulfides but also can accelerate the redox kinetics for the conversion of polysulfides. The enhanced electrochemical activity of Co3O4/CoO/GNS/h-BN is due to the (111) exposed surface of Co3O4 and the formation of CoO on Co3O4, which is the catalytically active phase of Co3O4-based catalysts. GNS/h-BN provides a large surface area for the high exposure of the Co3O4/CoO catalyst and can also influence the catalytic activity due to enhanced charge transfer. Co3O4/CoO/GNS/h-BN/S nanocomposites showed superior electrochemical performances and high sulfur utilization compared to GNS/h-BN/S and Co3O4/CoO/S. More significantly, a very high capacity retention of 89% was obtained with a reversible capacity of 356.29 mA h/g after 250 cycles at a current rate of 1 C. Also, enhanced redox conversion of lithium polysulfides was observed when the cell was operated at higher temperatures. Besides cobalt oxide, other metal oxides such as Fe2O3 and SnO2 on GNS/h-BN could also be potential candidates for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, we demonstrate that uniform coverage of high loading amount of sulfur on a cross-linked carbon nanofiber network (TiC@CNF) can be achieved in Li-S batteries, which was realized by the denseness and well distribution of pores in the three-dimensional weave of TiC@CNF. It significantly increases the reaction kinetics and inhibits the shuttle effect under lean electrolyte conditions. Impressively, at a sulfur loading of as high as 12.5 mg cm(-2) (S/C ratio, 4.56), the areal capacity of Li-S batteries with TiC@CNF can maintain over 9 mA h cm(-2) for 150 cycles at an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6 mu L mg(-1). The cathode structure design for high-loading sulfur provides a powerful strategy to realize fast S <-> Li2S reaction kinetics in the high energy density Li-S batteries.

However, the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites impedes the service of Li anodes in high energy and safety batteries. There are numerous studies on Li anodes, yet little attention has been paid to the intrinsic electrocrystallization characteristics of Li metal and their underlying mechanisms. Herein, a guided growth of planar Li layers, instead of random Li dendrites, is achieved on self-assembled reduced graphene oxide (rGO). In situ optical observation is performed to monitor the morphology evolution of such a planar Li layer. Moreover, the underlying mechanism during electrodeposition/stripping is revealed using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The combined experiment and simulation results show that when Li atoms are deposited on rGO, each layer of Li atoms grows along (110) crystallographic plane of the Li crystals because of the fine in-plane lattice matching between Li and the rGO substrate, resulting in planar Li deposition. With this specific topographic characteristic, a highly flexible lithium-sulfur (Li-S) full cell with rGO-guided planar Li layers as the anode exhibits stable cycling performance and high specific energy and power densities. This work enriches the fundamental understanding of Li electrocrystallization without dendrites and provides guidance for practical applications.

It is a significant challenge to achieve the instantaneous transformation of LiPSs to Li2S in Li-S batteries to suppress the shuttle effect of LiPSs. Herein, a unique electron and ion co-conductive catalyst of carbon-coated Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)(3) (C@LATP) is developed, which not only possesses strong adsorption to LiPSs, but, more importantly, also promotes the instantaneous conversion reaction of LiPSs to Li2S. The C@LATP nanoparticles as catalytic active sites can synchronously and efficiently provide both Li ions and electrons to facilitate the conversion reaction of LiPSs. The conversion reaction path of LiPSs using C@LATP changes from traditional "adsorption-diffusion-conversion" to novel "adsorption-conversion," which effectively lowers the decomposition barrier of Li2S6 and promotes faster conversion of LiPSs. The shuttle effect of LiPSs is considerably suppressed and utilization of sulfur is greatly improved. The Li-S batteries using C@LATP present excellent rate, cycling, and self-discharge properties. This work highlights the significance of electron and ion co-conductive solid-state electrolytes for the instantaneous transformation of LiPSs in advanced Li-S batteries.

Their capacities expressed in either mass (mA h g(-1)) or volume (mA h cm(-3)) dimensions have shown that specific surface area and nanoparticles loading are acting in a strong partitioning mode, rather than a cooperative mode, which does not favor the use of gold nanoparticles loading as efficient incremental path toward optimizing porous carbonaceous-based Li-S battery electrodes.

Unfortunately, the attempts of using TMPs as sulfur hosts in cathodes suffer from low sulfur loading and poor rate performance. Herein, Ni, Co bimetal phosphides are in-situ implanted into hollow carbon nanocages (Ni-Co-P@C) and utilized as the multifunctional separator interlayer to achieve durable Li-S batteries that can work at high current rates. Benefiting from the unique hollow nanocage and abundant synergistic adsorption-electrocatalytic sites, the Li-S battery with Ni-Co-P@C separator achieves ultrastable lifespan with only 0.056% capacity decay per cycle over 1000 cycles at 0.5 C and superior rate capability of 654.5 mAh g(-1) at 5 C. Moreover, the Li-S batteries with a high sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2) can still maintain a high areal capacity of 3.7 mAh cm(-2) after 85 cycles. This work demonstrates a new strategy to apply TMPs as a multifunctional mediator in separators for durable high-power Li-S batteries.

The fine active materials-electrolyte interface will be generated via in situ reaction. Compared with the direct mixing Li2S + LPS, the interface impedance between Li2S and LPS of Li2S-LPS had a significant decrease from 833.3 omega to 203.7 omega at room temperature. The effect of heat treatment temperature on the ionic conductivities of Li2S-LPS has been studied, and the Li2S-LPS-300 showed the highest ionic conductivity of 2.67 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at room temperature. The all-solid-state cell (Li/LPS/Li2S-LPS) possessed a larger capacity and better rate performance than that of the cell using Li2S + LPS as cathode material, showing a discharge capacity of 624.5 mAh g(-1) (g of Li2S) for the 20th cycle. We also find that high carbon content of composite cathode will reduce the utilization of Li2S. The composite cathode 90Li(2)S-LPS + 10C (wt%) shows the highest capacity of 763.8 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2).

Because of the presence of a large surface area (724 m(2) g(-1)) and an abundance of macro-/mesopores, the Co@ GC-PC electrode is able to alleviate the debilitating effect originating from the volume expansion/contraction of sulfur species during the cycling process. Our in situ UV/vis analysis indicates that the existence of Co@GC-PC promotes the adsorption of polysulfides during the discharge process. Density functional theory calculations show a strong interaction between Co and Li2S and a low decomposition barrier of Li2S on Co(111), which is beneficial to the following Li2S oxidation in the charge process. As a result, at 0.2C, the discharge capacity of the S/Co@GC-PC cathode is stabilized at 790 mAh g(-1) after 220 cycles, much higher than that of a carbon-based cathode, which delivers a discharge capacity of 188 mAh g(-1).

Such microstructures have unique physicochemical properties originating from confinement effects. Here, the modular assembly of scattered ketjen black nanoparticles into an oval-like microstructure via double "Fischer esterification," which is a form of surface engineering used to fine-tune the materials surface characteristics, is presented. After carbonization, the oval-like carbon microstructure shows promise as a candidate sulfur host for the fabrication of thick sulfur electrodes. Indeed, a specific discharge capacity of 8.417 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C with a high sulfur loading of 8.9 mg cm(-2) is obtained. The large-scale production of advanced lithium-sulfur battery pouch cells with an energy density of 460.08 Wh kg(-1)@18.6 Ah is also reported. This work provides a radically different approach for tuning the performance of a variety of surfaces for energy storage materials and biological applications by reconfiguring nanoparticles into desired structures.

Herein, a 3D hierarchical macro-mesoporous carbon with in-situ silica anchoring (SMC) is prepared via an economical and high-throughput sol-gel approach, followed by the ambient pressure drying and carbonization. The resultant carbons possess developed porosity with bi-continuous macro-mesoporous network. Moreover, the ultrathin silica nanoparticles are homogeneously anchored onto surface of macro-mesoporous carbon framework, which can greatly enhance the polar of carbon surface, thus improving the wettability and dispersion of sulfur during melt impregnation process. In addition, the polysulfides mobilization is also dramatically restrained through chemical binding between silica nanoparticles and polysulfides. Combined with the 3D conductive macro-mesoporous network, the resultant sulfur cathode could deliver a high reversible capacity of 969.7 mAh g(-1)- and enhanced capacity of 625.5 mAh g(-1)- with a capacity fading rate of only 0.088% per cycle after 400 cycles at 0.2 C. The present work may provide a direct and cost-effective approach to surface chemistry modification of carbon-based sulfur hosts to ultimately advance energy conversion and storage system.

Inspired by the nature of biomass and efficient nutrition transfer, we present a high-performance sulfur cathode based on nanocarbon tunnels with natural polar catalytic sites. The inherited tunnels can propel lithium-ion transport across the interface to reach the active materials and the interior heteroatom dopants provide abundant catalytic sites to further reduce the energy barriers. The as-fabricated sulfur cathode displays much higher rate performance of 565 mA h g(-1) at 6 C and a low decay rates of 0.029 % per cycle for 2000 cycles at 3 C. Most importantly, a high initial areal capacity of 5.1 mA h cm(-2) with enhanced loading up to 5.8 mg cm(-2) at 1 C is achieved, corresponding to volumetric capacity of 638 A h L-1.

The electrochemical performance of the composite (HMMCNT-S) is studied systematically at different discharge cut-off voltages and at varying sulfur content. The cycling behavior in different voltage windows is compared and the highest specific capacity is shown for HMMCNT-S-50 in the range of 1.4-2.8 V. These results imply that better energy densities can be achieved by controlling the discharge cut-off voltage. Moreover, we show that when the sulfur loading is 50% (HMMCNT-S-50), the cycling and rate performance is better than that of the composite loaded with 40% sulfur (HMMCNT-S-40). Benefiting from the attractive hierarchical micro/mesoporous configuration, the obtained hybrid structure not only promotes electron and ion transfer during the charge/discharge process, but also efficiently impedes polysulfide dissolution. More specifically, the electrode can deliver a specific capacity of 558 mA h g(-1) even after 150 cycles at a high rate of 1600 mA g(-1) with a decay rate of only 0.13% per cycle. Considering the beneficial structure of these carbon nanotubes, it is very feasible that these structures may also be used in other research fields, including in catalysis, as supercapacitors, in drug-delivery applications, for absorption, and so on.

The electrochemical behaviors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The prepared samples having Co3O4 particles on GNS provided the enhanced electrochemical reaction sites and ion-intercalation spots, which were accessible to supporting electrolyte ion effectively.

A tubular silica template acts as an alternative fiber template for anodic alumina membranes. The sulfur cathode fabricated with the nanofibers shows much better electrochemical performance compared with our previously reported BMC-1/S cathodes by achieving a more homogeneous sulfur distribution in the carbon nanofiber framework. It is also noted that the variation of porous architectures of the carbon framework (i.e., low volumetric ratio of small mesopores over the total pore volume) results in very different electrochemistry, suggesting the significance of porosity optimization for sulfur electrodes.

However, the real energy density and cycle life still remain challenges for their practical applications. The critical parameters of sulfur cathodes are the areal capacity and porosity which determine the gravimetric and volumetric energy density, and the flexibility related with cycle stability. Herein we proposed an artificial multifunctional flexible binder (AFB) to enable high-areal capacity (8.31 mAh cm(-2)) and flexible cathode via traditional bladecasting method. Owing to designed crosslinking network and enhanced kinetics, it exhibits high specific capacity and stable cycling without cathode structure collapse. Moreover, it delivered superior sulfur utilization with density up to 1.54 g cm(-3) corresponding to porosity of 13.3%. Designed dense electrode revealed normal electro-chemical behavior at initial cycles even under lean electrolyte of 1 ml g(composite)(-1), ascribed to the unique solid-solid conversion mechanism of S@pPAN.

Sizes and morphology of SNPs can be easily controlled by varying the micro-mixing degree. Using a high feed-speed equal to 110 mL min(-1), spherical composites containing SNPs covered with polyvinylpyrrolidone (S@PVP) with uniform morphology and an average diameter of 485 nm were obtained. These composites were tested as active cathode materials for Li-S batteries. Cathodes containing S@PVP composites exhibited high initial capacity equal to 1030.7 mA h g(-1). After 50 cycles at C/10, the capacity was 807.7 mA h g(-1). Such excellent capacity and capacity retention were attributed to the small size and homogeneous dispersion of SNPs as well as the conducting PVP layer, which provided effective multidimensional electron and ion transport pathways. The PVP layer also mitigated the problems associated with volume expansion, typically occurring during battery cycling. The simplicity and scalability of the method proposed in this work give it very strong potential for large-scale continuous fabrication of SNPs for Li-S rechargeable batteries.

This material allows uniform thin-layer loading of sulfur at a high density of 4 mg cm(-2) without loss of electrode conductivity. The Ti3C2 nanosheets form strong bonding with lithium polysulfides to inhibit shuttling. Also, the flexible enveloping Ti3C2 greatly enhances the ductility of CFs, which successfully withstands the stress and distortion caused by volume expansion, and thus avoids the pulverization of the cathode. The resulting Li-S battery exhibits remarkable cycling stability, a negligible capacity fading rate (0.06% per cycle over the first 200 cycles at 0.5C) and a greatly retained cycling capacity (626.0 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1C).

Herein, three-dimensional carbon nanosheet frameworks anchored with Ni@Ni3N heterostructure nanoparticles (denoted Ni@Ni3N/CNS) are designed and fabricated by a chemical blowing and thermal nitridation strategy. It is demonstrated that the Ni@Ni3N heterostructure can effectively accelerate polysulfide conversion and promote the chemical trapping of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the carbon nanosheet frameworks of Ni@Ni3N/CNS establish a highly conductive network for fast electron transportation. The cells with Ni@Ni3N heterostructures as the catalyst in the cathode show excellent electrochemical performance, revealing stable cycling over 600 cycles with a low-capacity fading rate of 0.04% per cycle at 0.5 C and high-rate capability (594 mAh g(-1) at 3 C). Furthermore, Ni@Ni3N/CNS can also work well in room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT-Na/S) batteries, delivering a high specific capacity (454 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at 0.5 C). This work provides a rational way to prepare the metal-metal nitride heterostructures to enhance the performance both of Li-S and RT-Na/S batteries.

The highly flexible, conductive 3D mesoporous interconnected network based on two-dimensional (2D) graphene nanosheets and one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) provides highly efficient channels for electron transfer and ionic diffusion, and leads to a low solubility of polysulfides in electrolytes in charges/discharges. Without polymeric binders or conductive additives, the freestanding 3DCG-Li2S cathode exhibits record electrochemical performances including reversible discharge capacities of 1123.6 mAh g(-1) and 914.6 mAh g(-1), 0.02% long-term capacity decay per cycle and a high-rate capacity of 514 mAh g(-1) at 4 C. The reported 3DCG-Li2S aerogel with ultrahigh Li2S content presents promising application potentials in high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, alloying metallic Ni with Fe increases the Ni-Ni(Fe) bond length and reduces the coordination number of Ni, realizing the upshift of the d-band center towards the Fermi level, and thus regulates sulfur species adsorbability to a rational level to accelerate their catalytic conversion. As a consequence, the Li-S batteries with Ni3Fe-modified separators exhibit superior rate performances (800 and 645 mA h g(-1) at 10 and 15C, respectively) and excellent cycling stability (capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle over 800 cycles at 2.0C). Meanwhile, the stable operation of high areal capacity Li-S batteries under a high sulfur loading of 30 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of similar to 7 mu L mg(-1) is realized. Besides, benefitting from the enhanced kinetics, the battery can work well at -10 degrees C, which is rarely achieved by conventional Li-S batteries. Our work provides a promising strategy for designing high-activity electrocatalysts for high-performance and low-temperature Li-S batteries.

Coating the LSB separator is an effective and simple way to mitigate the PS shuttle. However, these coating materials need to be carefully designed to produce an architecture with a high porosity, high surface area, and functional chemical binding sites. The judicious design of these materials will improve the sulfur utilization and hinder the PS shuttle. Here, conductive and chemically interactive zinc (Zn)- and nitrogen (N)-doped ZIF-8 derived carbon (ZnN-cZIF-8) with micropores <= 2 nm) is prepared through pyrolysis of pure ZIF-8. The ZnN-cZIF-8 is further activated in KOH to produce an ultrahigh surface area carbon (UHS-cZIF-8) with both micropores and mesopores. The aim of this study is to understand the relative importance of these material architectures on mitigating the PS shuttle in LSBs. Our research concludes that the ZnN-cZIF-8 with the chemically interactive sites (Zn and N contents) and a microporous structure enhances physisorption and chemisorption of PS, leading to a good long-term stability at a high sulfur loading.

However, due to their serious "shuttle effect" and low conductivity, the cycling stability of Li-S batteries is usually poor and the coulombic efficiency is low, which restrict their practical applications. Here, we have synthesized porous titanium nitride (TiN) tubes which possess high conductivity. The strong interaction between the TiN and lithium polysulfides greatly reduces the "shuttle effect" during the discharge/charge process. The cyclic voltammetric data indicated that TiN also plays an important catalytic role in promoting the oxidation process in Li-S batteries. When hollow TiN tubes were used as a sulfur host material with a high sulfur loading of 73.8 wt%, the TiN/S cathode presented a high specific capacity, high coulombic efficiency and excellent cycling performance. The initial discharge capacity at a high current density of 5.0C could be as high as 1026 mA h g(-1), and the battery exhibited a large reversible capacity of above 840 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C after 450 cycles.

Here, to address the above issues, the authors report a novel separator modified by CeO2-decorated porous carbon nanostructure (CeO2/KB/PP). Benefiting from the strong polar surface and large specific surface area, (CeO2-doped Ketjen Black) delivers efficient chemical adsorption toward lithium polysulfides. Moreover, rich oxygen vacancies of CeO2 provide abundant active sites to expedite lithium polysulfides conversion and regulate deposition and nucleation of Li2S. Taking advantage of these merits, the battery with the CeO2/KB/PP separator exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance, including low-capacity decay of only 0.06% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2 C and superior rate capability of 627 mAh g(-1) at 3 C.

Herein, we design a core-shell nanocomposite by encapsulating radially oriented MoS2 nanosheets by porous nitrogen-doped carbon (MoS2@NC) via an eco-friendly method. The highly oriented MoS2 nanosheets in MoS2@NC avoid aggregation of the active sites for polysulfide adsorption, and the desirable integration of the catalytic MoS2 nanosheet core and a highly conductive carbon shell provides a constant flow of electrons to the captured polysulfides for improved polysulfide conversion kinetics. The combined benefits of high polysulfide inhibition and smooth electron and Li+ transfer by a thin layer of MoS2@NC (3.3 m thick) enable a simple sulfur-carbon black cathode with high reversible capacities, good rate performances (876 mA h g(-1) at 3C), an excellent cycle stability over 1500 cycles with a negligible 0.034% decay per cycle, and satisfactory areal capacities with increased sulfur loading (2.0-3.7 mA h cm(-2) at various rates). This work provides a proof-of-concept study on the rational design of interlayer materials in energy storage systems.

Sulphur is an attractive positive electrode for lithium metal batteries, mainly due to its high capacity (1675 mAh g(-1)) and high specific energy (2600 Wh kg(-1)). The electrochemical reaction of lithium with sulphur in non-aqueous electrolytes results in the formation of electrolyte soluble intermediate lithium-polysulphides. The dissolved polysulphides shuttle to the anode and get reduced at the anode resulting in Li metal corrosion. The solubility of polysulphide gradually reduces the amount of sulphur in the cathode, thereby limiting the cycle life of Li-S batteries. Several strategies have been proposed to improve the cycling stability of Li-S batteries. A unique approach to eliminate the polysulphide shuttle is to use ultramicroporous carbon (UMC) as a host for sulphur. The pore size of UMC which is below 7 angstrom, is the bottleneck for carbonate solvents to access sulphur/polysulphides confined in the pores, thereby preventing the polysulphide dissolution. This perspective article will emphasise the role of UMC host in directing the lithiation mechanism of sulphur and in inhibiting polysulphide dissolution, including the resulting parasitic reaction on the lithium anode. Further, the challenges that need to be addressed by UMC-S based Li-S batteries, and the strategies to realise high power density, high Coulombic efficiency, and resilient Li-S batteries will be discussed.

A major drawback of Li-S batteries is a severe capacity fading effect which, to a large extent, stems from the dissolution and diffusion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) that are formed during both charge and discharge cycles. The self-discharge caused by the LiPS migration during the charge process (the so-called "shuttle effect") often leads to the capacity decay of Li-S batteries. Herein, hollow structured metal oxide (Co3O4, Mn2O3, and NiO) submicro-spheres are prepared by a novel method and employed as efficient LiPS immobilizers. These Li-S batteries, based on the developed metal oxide spheres, possess outstanding rate capability and cycling stability. The best performing S/C/Co3O4 electrode delivers excellent cycling stability with only a 0.066% capacity decay per cycle during 550 cycles. Moreover, its discharge capacity is as high as 428 mA h g(-1) at a 3C rate which is far superior to that of bare S/C (115 mA h g(-1)) at 3C. The fast kinetics of the electrocatalytic conversion of LiPS on the developed Co3O4 electrode and its unique hollow structure are the key factors that lead to its outstanding performance as a Li-S battery cathode material.

The 3D hierarchically ordered porous carbon (HOPC) with mesoporous walls and interconnected macropores was prepared by in situ self-assembly of colloidal polymer and silica spheres with sucrose as the carbon source. The obtained porous carbon possesses a large specific surface area and pore volume with narrow mesopore size distribution, and acts as a host and conducting framework to contain highly dispersed elemental sulfur. Electrochemical tests reveal that the HOPC/S nanocomposite with well-defined nanostructure delivers a high initial specific capacity up to 1193 mAh?g-1 and a stable capacity of 884 mAh?g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. In addition, the HOPC/S nanocomposite exhibits high reversible capacity at high rates. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed exclusively to the beneficial integration of the mesopores for the electrochemical reaction and macropores for ion transport. The mesoporous walls of the HOPC act as solvent-restricted reactors for the redox reaction of sulfur and aid in suppressing the diffusion of polysulfide species into the electrolyte. The open ordered interconnected macropores and windows facilitate transportation of electrolyte and solvated lithium ions during the charge/discharge process. These results show that nanostructured carbon with hierarchical pore distribution could be a promising scaffold for encapsulating sulfur to approach high specific capacity and energy density with long cycling performance.

The activated bamboo-derived carbon (A_BC) contains abundant micropores and mesopores, possessing a large surface area of 1565.4 m(2) g(-1) and total pore volume of 0.95 cm(3) g(-1), which are larger than vast majority of biomass materials. All these advantages contribute to improving sulfur loading in the A_BC matrix materials, and a high sulfur content of 86 wt% in the A_BC/S composite can be achieved. As the cathode for Li-S batteries, it displayed superior electrochemical properties, with an initial discharge capacity of 1160 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) and 1050 mA h g(-1) remained after ten cycles. Further cycled at 0.2 C for one hundred cycles, reversible capacity of 930 and 710 mA h g(-1) was reserved for the first and the 100th cycle, respectively. Further increasing to 0.5 C and 1 C, it still showed capacities of 695 and 580 mA h g(-1) with coulombic efficiency over 95%, suggesting this porous A_BC could be a superior carbon matrix for high sulfur loading as the cathode of rechargeable Li-S batteries.

Herein, sulfur cathodes with the multi-functional structures, featured with double-layered hollow carbon sphere with up to 50 nm interlayer space (DLHC-50) in situ grown Co-SnS catalytic layer is designed and synthesized for lithium sulfur batteries. Co-SnS/DLHC-50 can encapsulate 72% sulfur, higher than 63% for Co-SnS/DLHC-20 due to the large interlayer spaces of DLHC-50. Meanwhile, polysulfides are also effectively restricted via physical entrapment from DLHC-50 as well as chemical binding between CoSnS and polysulfides. Benefiting from the well-constructed host framework, Co-SnS/DLHC-50 @S shows higher specific capacity/capacity retention of 760.4 mA h g-1/72.9% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C, than that of 546.5 mA h g-1/62.2% and 668.9 mA h g-1/62.2%, for DLHC-50 @S, and Co-SnS/DLHC-20 @S, respectively. In addition, the strategy can be also extended to prepare other metal oxides (sulfides)/DLHC-50 for wide applications. Therefore, this work demonstrates a promising route to combat some bottlenecks such as low sulfur utilization, and the shuttle effect of polysulfides for Li-S batteries. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, their poor cycling stability mostly originates from the shuttling of polysulfides which hinders their future practical applications. Here, multi-shelled CoP nanospheres are designed as a coated separator material for Li-S batteries for the first time. Conductive CoP can efficiently anchor polysulfides not only owing to its polar character but also its partial natural surface oxidation feature as evidenced by XPS results, which further activates Co sites for chemically trapping polysulfides via strong Co-S bonding. Furthermore, the unique multi-shelled structure can capture polysulfides to alleviate the shuttle effect. Consequently, the battery using a CoP coated separator exhibits outstanding cycling stability with a capacity degradation of 0.078% per cycle over 500 cycles at a current density of 1 C and excellent rate performance (725 mA h g(-1) at 5 C). It is also worth noting that a high areal capacity of 3.2 mA h cm(-2) can be achieved even with a sulfur loading of 3.24 mg cm(-2). Our approach demonstrates the convenient fabrication and application potential for a multi-shelled CoP nanosphere modified separator for highly efficient Li-S batteries.

Here, the authors present a saccharide-based binder system to control the polysulfides migration and improve the cycle life of a Li-S pouch cell. The viability of lithium-sulfur batteries as an energy storage technology depends on unlocking long-term cycle stability. Most instability stems from the release and transport of polysulfides from the cathode, which causes mossy growth on the lithium anode, leading to continuous consumption of electrolyte. Therefore, development of a durable cathode with minimal polysulfide escape is critical. Here, we present a saccharide-based binder system that has a capacity for the regulation of polysulfides due to its reducing properties. Furthermore, the binder promotes the formation of viscoelastic filaments during casting which endows the sulfur cathode with a desirable web-like microstructure. Taken together this leads to 97% sulfur utilisation with a cycle life of 1000 cycles (9 months) and capacity retention (around 700 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles). A pouch cell prototype with a specific energy of up to 206 Wh kg(-1) is produced, demonstrating the promising potential for practical applications.

The free-standing sulfur-polypyrrole cathode was prepared by directly pasting a sulfur-coated polypyrrole (S@PPy) nanofiber composite on a flexible and conductive polypyrrole (PPy) film. Compared with carbonaceous matrixes, PPy has a strong interaction with polysulfides to mitigate the dissolution of polysulfides due to its unique chain structure and the lone pair electrons in the nitrogen atoms in PPy. In addition, the as-prepared PPy film not only shows excellent mechanical elasticity, but also possesses a rough surface, which can accommodate volume expansion, enhance the adhesion of active materials, and further trap the dissolved polysulfides. Due to the synergistic effect provided by the PPy film, the free-standing sulfur-polypyrrole cathode shows better electrochemical performance than the traditional cathode with S@PPy composite coated on Al foil. In order to further improve the cycling stability of Li-S batteries, a PPy coated separator was prepared, which acts as a fishing net to capture polysulfides and alleviate the shuttle effect, leading to a stable cycling performance. Moreover, the PPy layer coated on commercial separator is much lighter than many other freestanding interlayers reported previously. Considering the flexibility of the free-standing sulfur cathode and PPy coated separator, a soft-packaged flexible Li-S battery based on them has been designed and fabricated to power a device consisting of 24 light emitting diode (LED) lights. After repeated bending, the flexible Li-S battery can still maintain good performance, indicating the excellent mechanical flexibility of the designed Li-S battery.

Graphene and graphene oxide (GO) are being explored as effective cathode supports to alleviate these problems. However, there is a lack in fundamental understanding of the physical interactions between polysulfide and graphene/GO substrates. In order to determine the dominant mechanisms for physisorption of polysulfides on GO, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate polysulfides (S-8(2-)) solvated in standard dimethoxy ethane (DME)/dioxalane (DOL) (1:1 v/v) solvent near a range of graphene and GO structures. The results indicate that the extent of physisorption of polysulfide is governed by Coulombic interactions with GO, solvent orientation near substrates, and steric factors that depend on the nature and surface density of functional groups on the GO. Based on physisorption, GO with hydroxyl functional groups is the most effective in anchoring polysulfides. These results can potentially pave the way for design of molecularly tailored cathode supports to mitigate polysulfide shuttle and therefore improve performance of Li-S batteries.

However, the detrimental effects of their intermediate byproducts, polysulfides (PS), have to be resolved to realize these theoretical performance limits. Confined approaches on using porous carbons to entrap PS have yielded limited success. In this study, we deviate from the prevalent approach by introducing catalysis concept in Li/S battery configuration. Engineered current collectors were found to be catalytically active towards PS, thereby eliminating the need for carbon matrix and their processing obligatory binders, additives and solvents. We reveal substantial enhancement in electrochemical performance and corroborate our findings using a detailed experimental parametric study involving variation of several kinetic parameters such as surface area, temperature, current rate and concentration of PS. The resultant novel battery configuration delivered a discharge capacity of 700 mAh g(-1) with the two dimensional (2D) planar Ni current collectors and an enhancement in the capacity up to 900 mAh g(-1) has been realized using the engineered three dimensional (3D) current collectors. The battery capacity has been tested for stability over 100 cycles of charge-discharge.

Nonetheless, the real usage of LS battery obstructs by shuttling-effect of soluble lithium-based polysulfides (LiPSs) that result in languid redox reactions, while the vital diffusion and migration mechanism of Li and S onto TiN surface is yet a myth. Herein, rational synthesis of titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles and sulfur composite (TiN-NPs@S) via dry freezing method as cathode material is explored for high efficiency LiS batteries. The ultra-small nanoparticles exhibits high surface area with narrow pores which serve as conductive channels for proficient passage for ions/electrons exchange during electrochemical energy storage reactions. The density functional theory (DFT) computational results, charge density distribution and charge transfer and analysis of geometry constructions indicate TiN surface possess stronger adsorption strength to S atom than Li atom implies TiN as polysulfide adsorbent. The TiN cathode after 100 cycles exhibits an excellent initial capacity of 1279 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C about 75.8% of theoretical capacity (1562 mAh g(-1)). The hot-to-cold-synthesis method projects formation of ultra-small sized nanoparticles which illuminates bright panorama for Li-S batteries to achieve excellent conductivity, high power density and energy density, which is of great advantageous for industrial applications.

In this realm, both the severe shuttling of polysulfide and the uncontrollable growth of dendritic lithium have greatly hindered their commercial viability. Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of rational approaches to simultaneously regulate polysulfide behaviors and restrain lithium dendritic growth. Nevertheless, the major obstacles for high-performance Li-S batteries still lie in little knowledge of bifunctional material candidates and inadequate explorations of advanced technologies for customizable devices. Herein, a "two-in-one" strategy is put forward to elaborate V8C7-VO2 heterostructure scaffolds via the 3D printing (3DP) technique as dual-effective polysulfide immobilizer and lithium dendrite inhibitor for Li-S batteries. A thus-derived 3DP-V8C7-VO2/S electrode demostrates excellent rate capability (643.5 mAh g(-1) at 6.0 C) and favorable cycling stability (a capacity decay of 0.061% per cycle at 4.0 C after 900 cycles). Importantly, the integrated Li-S battery harnessing both 3DP hosts realizes high areal capacity under high sulfur loadings (7.36 mAh cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of 9.2 mg cm(-2)). This work offers insight into solving the concurrent challenges for both S cathode and Li anode throughout 3DP.

Then, CA@Gd2O3 was incorporated with sulfur by the melt-diffusion method to obtain CA@Gd2O3@S composites, which exhibited a superior electrochemical performance. The initial discharge specific capacity of the composite reached 1168.4 mAh/g at 0.1 C and maintained a reversible specific capacity of 814.4 mAh/g after 100 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical properties were mainly attributed to the strong polar adsorption of polysulfides by the abundant O2- ions on the surface of Gd2O3, which inhibited the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Moreover, the CA doped with Gd2O3 maintained a high specific surface area and large pore capacity to alleviate the poor electrical conductivity and volume expansion effect of sulfur cathode materials.

Here a special self-stabilized suspension catholyte is designed and prepared based on a pie-structured sulfur-Ketjenblack@reduced graphene oxide (S-KB@rGO) composite. In the S-KB@rGO suspension, the sulfur nanoparticles are loaded onto the conductive KB by an in situ redox reaction; the special hyperbranched structure of KB enhances the stability of the suspension; rGO sheets which wrap the S-KB particles not only act as a multilayered physical barrier for sulfur immobilization, but also facilitate electron transportation in the whole suspension. Therefore, a suspension catholyte with long-term physical and electrochemical stability is achieved by the synergetic effect of the KB and rGO. Li-S flow cells with this catholyte show excellent cycle stability (more than 1000 cycles with 99% coulombic efficiency) and low self-discharge (1.1% loss per day). Continuous charge/discharge tests in different flow modes are performed and the influence of the flow rate on the flow battery performance is discussed. The smooth operation in long-lasting flow mode further demonstrates the stability of the suspension catholyte.

Here, for the first time bipolar all-solid-state Li-S batteries (ASSLSBs) are demonstrated that exhibit exceptional safety, flexibility, and aesthetics. The bipolar ASSLSBs are fabricated through a solvent-drying-free, ultraviolet curing-assisted stepwise printing process at ambient conditions, without (high-temperature/high-pressure) sintering steps that are required for inorganic electrolyte-based all-solid-state batteries. Two thermodynamically immiscible and nonflammable gel electrolytes based on ethyl methyl sulfone (EMS) and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) are used to address longstanding concerns regarding the grain boundary resistance of conventional inorganic solid electrolytes, as well as the polysulfide shuttle effect in Li-S batteries. The EMS gel electrolytes embedded in the sulfur cathodes facilitate sulfur utilization, while the TEGDME gel composite electrolytes serve as polysulfide-repelling separator membranes. Benefiting from the well-designed cell components and printing-driven facile processability, the resulting bipolar ASSLSBs exhibit unforeseen advancements in bipolar cell configuration, safety, foldability, and form factors, which lie far beyond those achievable with conventional Li-S battery technologies.

Meanwhile, interlayer designs based on carbon materials have attracted widespread attention to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect in high-energy-density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Nevertheless, designing simple and low-cost carbon-derived interlayers still remains a great challenge. Spent graphite possesses a porous structure, defects, and polar functional groups that were formed in situ, which can significantly confine polysulfides through a combination of physical and chemical adsorption. Meanwhile, transition metals introduced due to the dissolution of cathode active materials can also anchor polysulfides via S-TM bonding, as well as improving electrical conductivity and boosting polysulfide conversion kinetics. Herein, spent graphite recycled from waste LIBs was employed for the first time as a functional interlayer for Li-S batteries based on its intrinsic properties. The spent-graphite-derived interlayer exhibited remarkably enhanced trapping and catalytic performance toward polysulfides. A high discharge capacity of 968 mA h g(-1) with a low decay rate of 0.08% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C can be obtained. The present work not only provides a promising strategy for the design of interlayers, but it also shows a high-value application of spent graphite.

In addition, the effect of the purified CNTs (PUCNTs) on the electrochemical performance of the Li/S cell was investigated. After the purification, almost all the impurities in the as-synthesized CNTs (ASCNTs) were removed, and the dispersibility of the CNTs was improved. On the other hand, the concentration of the structural defects and of the disordered structures in the PUCNTs was increased due to the surface oxidation of the tubes during acid treatment. In the case of the PUCNT-S composite powder, the outer wall of the tubes was well covered with sulfur, as opposed to the tubes in the ASCNT-S composite powder. The Li/S cell containing ASCNT-S composite cathode showed a large voltage decrease and a 680 mAh/g capacity during the first discharge process. The Li/S cell with PUCNT-S composite cathode, however, showed a higher discharge capacity and better cycle performance than the cell with ASCNT-S composite cathode. The electrochemical performance of the Li/S cell was improved for the PUCNT-S composite cathode using the CNTs purified by acid treatment.

A facile and mild method, diazotization, that enables uniform functionalization on the surface of ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) with aniline functional groups while not deteriorating the original CMK-3 microstructure is demonstrated. The aniline groups possess favorable interactions with insoluble discharge products. Thus, they homogeneously distribute the insoluble discharge products during cycling. The proposed materials exhibit outstanding electrochemical properties with regard to stability (920 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles) and rate capability (814 mAh g(-1) at 1 C) when evaluated as a cathode material for Li-S batteries.

In this study, we used urea as a nitrogen source due to its low cost and easy preparation. To find the optimum urea content, we tested three different ratios of urea to graphene oxide. The morphology of the composites was examined by field emission scanning electron microscope. Functional groups and bonding characterization were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammetry in an organic electrolyte solution. Compared with thermally reduced graphene/sulfur (S) composite, nitrogen-doped graphene/S composites showed higher electroactivity and more stable capacity retention.

In this work, we adopted a simple solid-phase sintering method to synthesize titanium disulfide (TiS2) and further demonstrated it as a superior modifier of separators for Li-S batteries. Two commonly adopted modification processes of separators, including vacuum filtration (VF) and slurry casting (SC) have been used to prepare TiS2/Celgard separators. TiS2-VF/Celgard can better restrain the polysulfide shuttling effect compared with TiS2-SC/Celgard. A TiS2-VF/Celgard-based Li-S battery has a reversible capacity of 771.6 mA h g(-1), with a capacity retention of 645.6 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 2.0 C, corresponding to a capacity fading rate of similar to 0.033% per cycle. This study has shown the potential of TiS2 as a multifunctional modifier of separators for high performance and long cycle life Li-S batteries.

J	Li, RR; Zhou, XJ; Shen, HJ; Yang, MH; Li, CL				Li, Rongrong; Zhou, Xuejun; Shen, Hangjia; Yang, Minghui; Li, Chilin			Conductive Holey MoO2-Mo3N2 Heterojunctions as Job-Synergistic Cathode Host with Low Surface Area for High-Loading Li-S Batteries	ACS NANO			English	Article						MoO2-Mo3N2; heterojunction host; polysulfide adsorption-conversion; cathode material; lithium-sulfur batteries	LITHIUM; CONVERSION; GRAPHENE; POLYSULFIDES; NANOWIRES; KINETICS; ANODE	Li-S batteries have several advantages in terms of ultrahigh energy density and resource abundance. However, the insulating nature of S and Li2S, solubility and shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and slow interconversion between LiPSs and S/Li2S/Li2S2 are significant impediments to the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Exploration of the advanced S host skeleton simultaneously with high conductivity, adsorbability, and catalytic activity is highly desired. Herein, a heterojunction material with holey nanobelt morphology and low surface area (95 m(2)/g) is proposed as a compact cathode host to enable a conformal deposition of S/Li2S with homogeneous spatial distribution. The rich heterointerfaces between MoO2 and Mo3N2 nanodomains serve as job-synergistic trapping-conversion sites for polysulfides by combining the merits of conductive Mo3N2 and adsorptive MoO2. This non-carbon heterojunction substrate enables a high S loading of 75 wt % even under low surface area. The initial capacity of MoO2-Mo3N2@S reaches 1003 mAh/g with a small decay rate of 0.024% per cycle during 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. The long-term cyclability is preserved even under a high loading of 3.2 mg/cm(2) with a reversible capacity of 451 mAh/g after 1000 cycles. The Li-ion diffusion coefficient for MoO2-Mo3N2@S is extremely high (up to 2.7 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s) benefiting from LiPS conversion acceleration at heterojunctions. The affinity between LiPSs and heterojunction allows a dendrite-free Li plating at anode even after long-term cycling. Well-defined heterointerface design with job-sharing or job-synergic function appears to be a promising solution to high-performance Li-S batteries without the requirement of loose or high-surface-area carbon network structures.

Herein, cobalt nanoparticles embedded N-doped carbon composite (Co-NC) decorated metallic tin with three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) structure is designed to deal with these issues. The ordered interconnected macropores of the unique hierarchical structure can provide smooth Li ion transport, and the micro-/mesopores of Co-NC derived from ZIF-67 can trap polysulfides. Additionally, the highly conductive metal Sn as 3DOM skeleton accel-erates charge transfer and strengthens the LiPS adsorption. Meanwhile, the embedded Co-NC further facilitates the polar adsorption of LiPS as well as its conversion kinetics. Benefiting from these features, the Co-NC@Sn (NH3) composite shows a relatively low capacity fading rate of 0.045 % per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C. Even with raised sulfur loading of 5.2 mg cm(-2), a high areal capacity of 4.65 mAh cm(-2) can be obtained. Pouch cell fabricated with Co-NC@Sn (NH3) delivers a high discharge capacity of 701 mAh g(-1) under high sulfur loading of 4.50 mg cm(-2), implying the superiority of the S/Co-NC@Sn (NH3) cathode. This work provides a new strategy in efficient sulfur immobilizer design for advanced Li-S batteries development. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When the sulfur content is limited to 41.21 wt.%, it can be loaded into the pores of an activated carbon matrix in a highly dispersed state. On the contrary, when the sulfur content is 55.33 wt.%, crystalline sulfur can be detected on the surface of the activated carbon matrix. The best electrochemical performance can be obtained for a sulfur electrode with the lowest sulfur content. The sulfur/activated carbon composite with 32.37 wt.% sulfur afforded the highest first discharge capacity of 1360 mAh g(-1) at 1 C rate and a large reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(-1) at 10 C (16.75 A/g).

Among them, the main issue is the shuttle reaction caused by the dissolution of lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte. Recently, nitrogen-doped carbon materials are attracting attention as inhibitors for the shuttle reaction. However, according to our humble opinion, it is not easy to control the nitrogen doping configurations of nitrogen-doped carbon materials as wish. The nitrogen doping configurations of nitrogen-doped graphene are very similar to the structure of some organic compounds, especially metal-free phthalo-cyanine. From this, density functional theory calculations are performed for the bound configurations between lithium polysulfides and metal-free phthalocyanine to assess the availability of metal-free phthalocyanine as an inhibitor for the shuttle reaction. The results show that metal-free phthalocyanine has sufficient potential to be used as an anchoring material for lithium polysulfides.

The asymmetric CNT@C (1:2) membrane with both dense and macroporous layers can act as an Al-free cathode for current collection and high sulfur loading, while the symmetric CNT@C (1:1) membrane with hierarchically porous networks can be used as an interlayer to trap lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), thus weakening the shuttle effect by strong adsorption of the N atoms toward LiPSs. The doped N sites in carbon membranes are identified as bifunctional active centers that electrocatalytically accelerate the oxidation of Li2S and polysulfide conversion. First-principles calculations reveal that the pyridinic and pyrrolic N sites exhibit favorable reactivity for strong adsorption/dissociation of polysulfide species. They lead to greatly reduced energy and kinetic barrier for polysulfide conversion without weakening the polysulfide adsorption on the membrane. Using the synergistic circulation groove with the two membranes, the practical S loading can be tailored from 1.2 to 6.1 mg cm(-2). The Li-S battery can deliver an areal capacity of 4.6 mA h cm(-2) (684 mA h g(-1)) at 0.2 C even at an ultrahigh S loading of 6.1 mg cm(-2) and a lean electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 5.3 mu L mg(-1). Our work for scalable membrane fabrication and structural design provides a promising strategy for practical applications of high-energy Li-S batteries.

The major challenge of this system is the polysulfide shuttle, which results in poor cycling efficiency. In this work, a highly N-doped carbon/graphene (NC/G) sheet is designed as a sulfur host, which combines the merits of abundant N active sites and high electrical conductivity to achieve in situ anchoring-conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Such a host not only has strong binding with LiPSs but also promotes redox kinetics, which are revealed by both experimental investigations and theoretical studies. The sulfur cathode based on the NC/G host exhibits a high initial capacity of 1380 mA h g(-1) and a superior cycle stability with a low capacity decay of 0.037% per cycle within 500 cycles at 2 C. Steady areal capacity with a high sulfur loading (5.6 mg cm(-2)) is also attained even without the addition of LiNO3 in the electrolyte. This work proposes and illustrates the importance of in situ anchoring-conversion of LiPSs, offering a new strategy to design multifunctional sulfur hosts for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, a Pt@Ni core-shell bimetallic catalyst with a patch-like or complete Ni shell based on a confined catalysis reaction in porous carbon spheres is reported. The Pt nanodots can effectively direct and catalyze in situ reduction of Ni2+ ions to form core-shell catalysts with a seamless interface that facilitates the charge transfer between the two metals. Thus, the bimetallic catalysts offer a synergic effect on catalyzing reactions, which shows dual functions for catalytic oxidation of insoluble polysulfides to soluble polysulfides by effectively reducing the energy barrier with simultaneous strong adsorption, ensuring a high reversible capacity and cycling stability. A novel process based on the Pt@Ni core-shell bimetallic catalyst with a patch-like Ni shell is proposed: electronic migration from Ni to Pt forces Ni to activate Li2S2/Li2S molecules by promoting the transformation of Li-S-Li to Ni-S-Li, consequently releasing Li+ and free electrons, simultaneously enhancing protonic/electronic conductivity. The presence of the intermediate state Ni-S-Li is more active to oxidize Li2S to polysulfides. The Li2S bound to adjacent Pt sites reacts with abundant -S-Li species and then releases the Pt sites for the next round of reactions.

In this study, an Fe-P-S-based material is prepared and characterized for the use as a sulfur electrode with a low content of carbon additives. The electrode material based on Fe-P-S is synthesized by the mechanical milling of FePS3 and elemental sulfur. The ball-milled 70FePS(3)center dot 30S (wt%) electrode comprises FeS2 particles of similar to 30 nm in size and amorphous P-S. The all-solid-state battery operated at 100 degrees C exhibits a reversible capacity of more than 625 mAh g(-1) for 50 cycles at 0.51 mA cm(-2) (similar to 0.1C) in spite of the low carbon content (2 wt%) in the electrode. During the discharge-charge cycle, the sulfur component is confirmed to be both reduced and oxidized, cyclically.

The electrochemical performance of Li2S can be significantly enhanced by forming Li2S-carbon composites with the introduction of carbon. However, the complex synthesis method of Li2S carbon composites restrains the large-scale productivity. Herein, we propose a facile route to prepare carbon coated Li2S-carbon nanotube composites (Li2S@C-CNT) via spray drying and heat treatment, which is a low-cost and large-scale method for facile synthesis of Li2S-carbon composites. For the Li2S@C-CNT composites, Li2S nanoparticles are contacted with surrounding particles due to the 3D CNTs framework. The novel construction not only suppresses the diffusion of polysulfides during cycling, but also remarkably accelerates the transport of electron and ion, resulting in a high specific capacity (1100 mAh g(-1)) and good cycling performance. The rational designed architecture and good electrochemical performance of Li2S@C-CNT will pave the avenue for realizing high energy density of Li2S-based batteries.

However, issues such as the lithium polysulfide shuttle effect and its insulating properties greatly limit the future applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Here, a viscous aqueous ink with nanoscale S uniformly decorated on the polar, metallically conductive titanium carbide MXene nanosheets (S@Ti3C2Tx) is reported to address these issues. Importantly, it is observed that the conductive Ti3C2Tx mediator efficiently chemisorbs the soluble polysulfides and converts them into thiosulfate/sulfate. The in situ formed sulfate complex layer acts as a thick protective barrier, which significantly retards the shuttling of polysulfides upon cycling and improves the sulfur utilization. Consequently, the binder-free, robust, highly electrically conductive composite film exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance, including high capacities (1244-1350 mAh g(-1)), excellent rate handling, and impressive cycling stability (0.035-0.048% capacity loss per cycle), surpassing the best MXene-S batteries known. The fabrication of a pouch cell based on the freestanding S@Ti3C2Tx film is also reported. The prototype device showcases high capacities and excellent mechanical flexibility. Considering the broad family of MXenes and their unique roles in immobilizing the polysulfides, various S@MXene composites can be similarly fabricated with promising Li+ storage capability and long lifetime performance.

In this study, we activated coal tar pitch by a green process to obtain porous carbon sheets sandwiched by graphene, and further impregnated with 71% sulphur as the cathode for long-term cycling lithium-sulphur battery. In the presence of 4.0% of electrochemically exfoliated graphene flakes, the yield of carbon from pitch is as high as 72%, while the activation temperature of the pitch is as low as 700 degrees C. This carbon sheet has a high specific surface area of 2930 m(2) g(-1) and large pore volume of 1.5 cm(3) g(-1), which is nearly 3 times that of activated carbon derived from pitch without graphene. The cathode loaded with 71% sulfur (3.0 mg cm(-2) of sulphur) demonstrated a discharge capacity of 1340 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C, which faded by only 0.001% per cycle at 1 C during 201-1500 cycles. Surface oxygen groups, 1.1 nm nanopore confinement and the sandwich structure of conductive graphene may contribute to the stable and reversible electrochemical reaction of the Li and sulphur clusters. Our investigation demonstrates that graphene can enhance the pitch activation to high quality microporous carbon and further confine sulphur species for long-term cycling Li-S batteries.

A poly(N-methylpyrrole) (PNMPy) coating is applied over a S@reduced graphene oxide (S@RGO) composite and a gel polymeric electrolyte composed of lithium imide, poly(methyl methacrylate), and fumed silica nanoparticles (Li+/PMMA/SiO2) substitutes the conventional liquid electrolyte in a Li-S@RGO-PNMPy cell. The PNMPy overlayer at the S@RGO composite, allows the unobstructed passage of Li-ions between the cathode and the electrolyte during charge-discharge by the virtue of a high Li-ion diffusion coefficient of similar to 10(6) cm(2) s(-1), while it simultaneously functions as a physical barrier and efficiently restricts the polysulfide dissolution and shuttle, thus increasing the capacity retention from 13 to 40%, after 500 cycles. The Li+/PMMA/SiO2 gel is characterized by a liquid-like ionic conductivity that varies from 2.6 to 86 mS cm(-1), over a temperature window of 5-75 degrees C and a wide electrochemical voltage stability window of similar to 1-3 V versus Li/Li+, thereby enabling its use in all Li-chalcogenide batteries. Notwithstanding the higher magnitude of stable capacity at the end of 500 charge-discharge cycles of 476 mAh g(Sulfur)(-1) for the liquid electrolyte based Li-S@RGO-PNMPy cell, the analogous Li+/PMMA/SiO2 gel based cell demonstrates a superior capacity retention, a better reversibility or Coulombic efficiency response over the cycle life and is safer than its' liquid counterpart. The simplicity of the two novel approaches relying on the abilities of the PNMPy overlayer and the Li+/PMMA/SiO2 gel in bringing about improvements in the performance of the Li-S cell with technological ramifications is a pivotal step towards developing commercial Li-S batteries.

In the paper, we designed hollow SrTiO3 microspheres wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (SrTiO3@rGO) as efficient sulfur host materials with the aim of suppressing LiPSs shuttle and improving cycling stability of Li-S batteries. The hollow SrTiO3 microspheres wrapped by rGO, with appropriate binding energy to LiPSs, provide balancing surface adsorption and diffusion of LiPSs on nonconductive SrTiO3 and then promote its conversion on the interface, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect and greatly minimizing the active material irreversible loss in charge discharge process. Meanwhile, the conductive rGO tightly wrapped on the surface of SrTiO3 offers an interconnected conductive network to support the fast electron/ion transfer. Profit from these merits, the SrTiO3 @rGO as sulfur host manifested superior cycling stability with a meager capacity decay rate of 0.0398% per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.2 C and an ultralow decay rate of 0.024% per cycle after 600 cycles at 1 C. The superior cycling stability suggested the hollow SrTiO3 @rGO was a potential candidate for the cathode of high-performance Li-S battery. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The material is fabricated based on a scalable, one-step process involving the pyrolysis of melamine polyphosphate synthesized via a simple and versatile organic approach by using low cost industrial raw materials (melamine and polyphosphoric acid). The key features of NPHPC are the hierarchically porous structure and high surface area (1398 m(2) g(-1)) that not only benefit for maximum sulfur loading but also capable of suppressing the dissolution of polysulfides through physisorption. Meanwhile, the N and P codopants together with the thermally stable functionalities are favorable for binding polysulfides via chemisorption. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of structural confinement (physisorption) and chemical binding (chemisorption), the NPHPC/S composite with a high sulfur content of 73 wt% delivers high capacity (1580 mAh g(-1) at 0.02 C) and long lifespan (200 cycles with 71% retention) for Li-S batteries. The present work highlights the importance of adopting heteroatom-doped hierarchically porous carbon for improving the performance of Li-S batteries, which may further stimulate more efforts in exploring advanced carbon-based hosts in the near future.

In the roadmap towards the real use, besides the formation of the dendrite, various adverse reactions due to the high activity of LMA when exposed to air or the electrolyte limit its practical applications. Learning from the packaging technology in electronic industry, we propose a wax-based coating compositing with the ion conducting poly (ethylene oxide) by a simple dip-coating technology and the prepared LMA is featured with an air-stable and waterproof surface. The LMA thus remains stable for 24 h in ambient air even with the relative humidity of 70% while retaining about 85% its electrochemical capacity. More importantly, the LMA is accessible to water and when dipping in water, no obvious adverse reactions or capacity decay is observed. With the composite coating, a steady cycling performance for 500 h in symmetrical cells and a low capacity decay rate of 0.075% per cycle after 300 cycles in lithium-sulfur batteries assembled with the packaged anode have been achieved. This work demonstrates a very simple and effective LMA package technology which is easily scalable and is very promising for speeding up the industrialization of lithium-sulfur batteries and shows potentials for the large-scale production of air-sensitive electrode materials not limited to LMAs.

The good blocking ability for LiPSs indicates that these interlayers can promote the electrochemistry performance with high S loading. However, most of these interlayers are just used as a simple blocking wall. Such a blocking wall, for example, the lower Li+ ion conductivity, would often reduce the electrochemical performance, especially under large current density. Here, we report a multifunctional ion-sieve made by three two-dimensional (2D) sheets, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), boron nitride (BN), and graphene. A g-C3N4 sheet which possesses orderly channels with a size of 3 angstrom in the crystalline structure can effectively prevent polysulfides from passing through but allow lithium ions to pass freely, whereas a BN sheet acts as an excellent catalyst for sulfur redox, and graphene acts as an extended collector, which can promote the conductivity of the sulfur electrode region. Benefiting from the synergistic effect among these 2D materials, the ion-sieve interlayer makes the Li-S battery show excellent performance at a large rate with both high sulfur loadings and high sulfur content. In addition, the host materials are not necessary in these cells. The ion-sieve liberated a discharge capacity of about 600 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C, and the capacity attenuation was less than 0.01% per cycle with a 6 mg cm(-2) areal S-loading (pure S as the active material). The reversible capacity could be maintained at more than 400 mA h g(-1) at 2 C, which amounts to an area current density of 26.88 mA cm(-2).

Nevertheless, investigations on probing the electrocatalytic endurance and protecting the catalyst activity yet remain elusive. Here, a ternary graphene-TiO2/TiN (G-TiO2/TiN) heterostructure affording conformal graphene chainmail is presented as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for expediting sulfur redox kinetics. The G-TiO2/TiN heterostructure synergizes adsorptive TiO2, catalytic TiN, and conductive graphene armor, thus enabling abundant anchoring points for polysulfides and sustained active sites to allow smooth bi-directional electrocatalysis. Encouragingly, in situ crafted graphene chainmail ensures favorable protection of inner TiO2/TiN to retain their catalytic robustness towards durable sulfur chemistry. As expected, sulfur cathodes mediated by ternary G-TiO2/TiN harvest an impressive rate capability (698.8 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C), favorable cycling stability (a low decay of 0.054% per cycle within 1000 cycles), and satisfactory areal capacity under elevated loading (delivering 8.63 mAh cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of 10.4 mg cm(-2)). The ternary heterostructure design offers an in-depth insight into the electrocatalyst manipulation and protection toward long lifespan Li-S batteries.

Herein, we demonstrate the good low-temperature electrochemical performances of nitrogen-enriched carbon/sulfur composite cathodes. Electrochemical evaluation indicates that a reversible capacity of 368 mAh g(-1) (0.5 C) over 100 cycles is achieved at -20 degrees C. After returning to 25 degrees C, a capacity of 620 mAh g(-1) (0.5 C) is achieved over 350 cycles with a low-capacity attenuation rate (0.071% per cycle) and an initial capacity of 1151 mAh g(-1) (0.1C). This positive electrochemical property was speculated to result from the good surface chemistry of the various amine groups in the nitrogen-enriched carbon materials with enhanced polysulfide immobilization.

In this work, conductive reduced graphene oxides nanosheets added-putty (rGO-putty) adaptive functional interlayer is designed to effectively suppress the diffusion of polysulfides while simultaneously promoted the dynamic protection of the whole cathode structure during cycling. Consequently, largely suppressed polysulfides diffusion combined with the greatly enhanced cathode stability is achieved while the all-around conductive protecting layer is formed benefited from the viscoelasticity property of rGO-putty. As a result, a capacity of 586 mAh g(-1) is demonstrated after long-cycling term of 1000 cycles and high cycling stability of only 0.03% capacity decay per cycle is exhibited. The largely enhanced electrochemical performance suggests the important role of the rGO-putty in suppressing the "shuttle effect" and maintaining the integrity of the cathode material.

Herein, a new strategy of using lithium polyacrylate (LiPAA) to clad multiwalled carbon nanotube/sulfur (MWNT/S) composites as the interface layer for an MWNT/S/LiPAA cathode was proposed, not only to suppress polysulfide migration through physical encapsulation and chemical adsorption, but also to facilitate Li+ diffusion during the charge/ discharge process. Attributed to these functions of LiPAA, MWNT/S/LiPAA exhibited a rate capability and cycling performance superior to those of MWNT/S and MWNT/S/PAA. Moreover, thanks to the introduction of LiPAA, the MWNT/S/LiPAA was endowed with robust mechanical properties, making it suitable for a flexible cathode in a flexible Li-S battery with stable output under deformation. This work could open up a promising way to suppress polysulfide migration for high-performance flexible Li-S batteries.

Appropriate binders could play a key role of anchoring the lithium polysulfides in S-cathode through strong chemical bonds, thus boosts the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery. Herein, we report a new binder (fenugreek gum, FG) that has enhanced significantly the cycling performance of Li-S batteries with S@CNFs composite as cathode. The Li-S cell with FG binder delivers a large initial capacity of 900 mAh g(-1)at 2 C, and a reversible capacity retention of 45.6 % after 1300 cycles, superior to the cycling performance of Li-S cell with conventional PVDF or previous reported guar gum (GG) binder. This enhancement in cycling performance of Li-S batteries could be attributed to the formation of the S-O and Li-O bonds between the O-relevant functional groups in the binder and the polysulfides in S-cathode as manifested by XPS data of the discharged and charged electrodes. Furthermore, the tensile strain rate of the FG binder is as high as 32 %, which can effectively restrain the volume expansion of the S-cathode during the discharge/charge process and ensure the integrity of the electrode.

Here, we report the promising electrochemical charge-discharge properties of a carbon-sulfur composite, in which sulfur is impregnated in porous hollow carbon spheres (PHCSs) via a melt-diffusion method. Instrumental analysis shows that the PHCSs, which were prepared by a facile template strategy, are characterized by high specific surface area (1520 m(2)center dot g(-1)), large pore volume (2.61 cm(3)center dot g(-1)), broad pore size distribution from micropores to mesopores, and high electronic conductivity (2.22 S center dot cm(-1)). The carbon-sulfur composite with a sulfur content of 50.2 wt.% displays an initial discharge capacity of 1450 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) (which is 86.6% of the theoretical specific capacity) and a reversible discharge capacity of 1357 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.05 C charge-discharge rate. At a higher rate of 0.5C, the capacity stabilized at around 800 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) after 30 cycles. The results illustrate that the porous carbon-sulfur composites with hierarchically porous structure have potential application as the cathode of Li-S batteries because of their effective improvement of the electronic conductivity, the repression of the volume expansion, and the reduction of the shuttling loss.

However, Li+ transport is usually poor in thick cathodes, resulting in low capacity output, fast capacity decay and large overpotential. To tackle the issue of thick sulfur cathodes, a thickness-independent electrode structure is proposed for the first time which can transform a thick electrode into a combination of vertically aligned "thin electrodes". Each "thin electrode" has a thickness of similar to 20 mu m, which is independent of the overall thickness of electrode or sulfur loading. The "thin electrodes" substantially enhanced local accessibility to Li+ and e(-) and enabled similar electrochemical kinetics in spite of the total sulfur loading or thickness of the electrode. Accordingly, highly similar cycling performance and rate performance were demonstrated with the 250 mu m and 750 mu m (i.e. sulfur loadings of 2 and 6 mg cm(-2)) electrodes. This work demonstrates the concept and offers a new opportunity for designing high-loading cathodes and shall rise interests for other energy storage systems such as Li-ion batteries, Li-air batteries, etc.	[Gao, Xuejie; Yang, Xiaofei; Sun, Qian; Luo, Jing; Liang, Jianneng; Li, Weihan; Wang, Jiwei; Wang, Sizhe; Li, Minsi; Li, Ruying; Sun, Xueliang] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; [Gao, Xuejie; Li, Weihan; Wang, Jiwei; Li, Minsi; Sham, Tsun-Kong] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Chem, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada		Sun, XL (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada.; Sham, TK (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Chem, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.	xsun9@uwo.ca	Sun, Qian/G-4552-2011; Wang, Sizhe/AHD-3983-2022; Sun, Xueliang/C-7257-2012	Sun, Qian/0000-0001-5399-1440; Wang, Sizhe/0000-0002-2068-6308; Yang, Xiaofei/0000-0002-2713-9681; Luo, Jing/0000-0003-3844-9746	Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Canada Research Chair Program (CRC); Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); Western University	Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canada Research Chair Program (CRC)(Canada Research Chairs); Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Western University	This research was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Canada Research Chair Program (CRC), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Western University.		45	35	36	10	104	ELSEVIER	AMSTERDAM	RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	2405-8297			ENERGY STORAGE MATER	Energy Storage Mater.

In the battery construction, a nanopore separator can improve the performance of the Li-S battery by working as a nanofiltration film, inhibiting the migration of soluble polysulfide ions between the electrodes. Herein, a new strategy to synthesize a nanopore separator of poly(propylene glycol)-co-pentaerythritol triacrylate (PPG-co-PETA) particles to suppress polysulfide shuttling has been proposed. The PPG-co-PETA cross-linked particles were easily obtained by a facile approach of UV-induced monomer polymerization while implementing molecular cross-linking for nanopore control. The characteristic nanopore size of the PPG-co-PETA separator ranged from similar to 1.24 nm to similar to 1.86 nm upon changing the type of photo-initiator and content of cross-linking agent. The results showed that the optimized separator for a Li-S battery could possess an electrolyte uptake of 350% with excellent thermal, mechanical and electrochemical properties. Notably, the Li-S battery using such a new type of nanopore separator exhibits superior retention discharge capacity (> 200 cycles). It is believed that the nanopore separator of cross-linked PPG-co-PETA is a potential alternative to the commercial Celgard separator for effectively blocking polysulfide shuttling in Li-S batteries.

J	Kamphaus, EP; Balbuena, PB				Kamphaus, Ethan P.; Balbuena, Perla B.			Long-Chain Polysulfide Retention at the Cathode of Li-S Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; ELECTROLYTES; STORAGE; DESIGN	Lithium-sulfur batteries present a complex interconnected chemistry where the three components anode, electrolyte, and cathode strongly interact with each other. One of the main issues associated with these interactions is the dissolution in the electrolyte solution of part of the, sulfur reduction products (mainly long-chain polysulfides) during the discharge reactions at the cathode. These dissolved species can migrate and react at the anode surface producing undesired insulating films. A potential solution to mitigate this problem is to resort to additional materials which can act as anchors of the soluble species thus avoiding their migration. Density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the ability of certain substrates to retain long-chain polysulfides (Li2S6 and Li2S8) at their surfaces in the presence of a pure solvent or a lithiated solution. Nanopores of graphene are first tested because the cathode is usually a mix of sulfur and carbon. Then, MoS2 and Mo-doped graphene are evaluated because of the well-known Mo-S affinity. Finally, a material which has been reported successful in experimental studies, MnO2, is analyzed and compared with another oxide surface, Fe2O3. Adsorption energies of the polysulfides to the surfaces and the detailed interactions of the Li ions and S atoms with the substrate are characterized via charge and geometric analyses. Both the Mo-containing materials and the oxides adsorb the polysulfides much more strongly than graphene nanopores do. However, some of these surfaces are found to be excessively reactive. A balance between affinity for S and moderate surface reactivity is found as a promising guideline for designing these materials.

The TiO2/3DOMC exhibits high pore volume and specific surface area, accommodating up to 73.2wt% in sulfur content. As a sulfur host, S/TiO2/3DOMC composite was able to delivered 1105mAhg(-1) on first discharge and 695mAhg(-1) after 150 cycles at a current rate of 0.5C. Even though at 2C this material was able to keep a capacity of 551mAhg(-1). We attribute the superior performance to the good conductivity and structural restriction of carbon and the intense electrostatic attraction between metal-oxygen bond and polysulfides to encapsulate sulfur of the TiO2/3DOMC.

This assembly has an ultrahigh density, delivering an unprecedented volumetric capacity that is much higher than common carbon/sulfur cathodes.

Energy efficiency on the other hand is often overlooked but vital to the commercial deployment of battery technology. In this work, a composite of hyperbranched poly(amidoamine)-modified multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PAMAM-CNTs) is successfully prepared by chemical grafting and employed as an interlayer material in LSBs. The high content and highly dispersed polar functional groups of PAMAM can efficiently adsorb and enhance the redox reaction of LiPSs. The CNTs function as a scaffold and current collector that reduces the internal polarization. The assembled LSB displays a high energy efficiency of 86% and a low capacity fading rate of 0.037% per cycle over 1200 cycles at 2 C. The cell also shows excellent cycle performance, high sulfur utilization, and improved stability at a high areal capacity of 9 mAh cm(-2) (achieved at a sulfur loading of 8.7 mg cm(-2)) and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6.1 mL g(-1). This thin (12 mu m) and lightweight (0.34 mg cm(-2)) interlayer has a negligible impact on the overall cell energy density.

An Extremely High Surface Area Mesoporous-Microporous-Networked Pillared Carbon for High Stability Li-S and Intermediate Temperature Na-S Batteries	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						sulfur confinement; high surface area networked mesoporous-microporous carbon; Li-S battery; room and intermediate temperature; Na-S battery	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; CELL CHEMISTRY; POROUS CARBON; CHALLENGES; CATHODE	A high surface area porous carbon synthesized using a sacrificial-template assisted synthesis protocol, is demonstrated here as a host for the confinement of sulfur for use in Li-S and intermediate temperature (25-70 degrees C) Na-S rechargeable batteries. The hierarchical porous pillared carbon host, comprising of an intricate network of mesopores and micropores provide a landscape of sites with varying strength of interaction with sulfur. Thus, the amount of sulfur (and associated polysulfides) inside the carbon host is predetermined by the host structural characteristics rather than by the loading protocol. The mesoporous-microporous carbon led to sulfur content in excess of 70%. While the bulk of S (and polysulfides) are stored inside the mesopores of the carbon host, the micropore apart from sulfur storage strongly contributes towards the modulation of sulfur flux during charge-discharge cycling. The S-C cathode exhibited remarkable cycling and rate capability with Li and also against Na at intermediate temperature (25-70 degrees C). This result is a paradigm shift from the conventional Na-S electrochemistry which is known to efficiently work only at elevated temperatures, in the temperature range starting from excess of 100 degrees C to 300 degrees C.

Herein, we study and compare the reaction mechanism and kinetics of Li-S batteries via operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) and quantitative analysis based on several cathode structures. Operando XRD indicates that -S-8 has different nucleation orientations on MnO2 and carbon surfaces due to the different surface free energies. The quantitative analysis reveals that polysulfides encapsulated in MnO2 nanosheets result in fast Li2S and -S-8 nucleation in the discharge and charge processes, respectively. It also shows that open-hollow S@MnO2 exhibits faster S consumption and higher sulfur utilization than the solid core-shell S@MnO2 and carbon black/S. Our work provides deep insight into the reaction mechanism and kinetics of Li-S batteries and indicates that the cathode structures and host materials play critical roles in enhancing the reaction kinetics.

The rational design of electrolytes is strongly considered to obtain uniform SEI in working batteries. Herein, a modification of nitrate ion (NO3-) is proposed and validated to improve the homogeneity of the SEI in practical LMBs. NO3- is connected to an ether-based moiety to form isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) to break the resonance structure of NO3- and improve the reducibility. The decomposition of non-resonant -NO3 in ISDN enriches SEI with abundant LiNxOy and induces uniform lithium deposition. Lithium-sulfur batteries with ISDN additives deliver a capacity retention of 83.7 % for 100 cycles compared with rapid decay with LiNO3 after 55 cycles. Moreover, lithium-sulfur pouch cells with ISDN additives provide a specific energy of 319 Wh kg(-1) and undergo 20 cycles. This work provides a realistic reference in designing additives to modify the SEI for stabilizing LMBs.

Sulfur-containing solution can completely penetrate porous material and in preference remove into the pores under the influence of capillary force, and sulfur tends to crystallize on the defective even non-defective carbon matrix rather than agglomerate. The S/PC composites prepared by this method can still achieve uniform distribution of sulfur when the sulfur content is as high as 85%. All operations can be completed within a few minutes without any heating. Compared with common melt-diffusion and vapor-phase infusion, this approach has lower energy consumption and is simple, safe, continuous, and rapid.

Herein, we report the construction of a cycle stable sulfur electrode by embedding sulfur into a 2D COF. The designed porphyrin-based COF (Por-COF), featuring a relatively large pore volume and narrow pore size distribution, has been employed as a host material for sulfur storage in Li-S batteries. With a 55% sulfur loading in the composite, the thus prepared cathode delivers a capacity of 633 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C charge/discharge rates. Therefore, embedding sulfur in the nanopores of the Por-COF significantly improves the performance of the sulfur cathode. Considering the flexible design of COFs, we believe that it is possible to synthesize a 2D COF host with a suitable pore environment to produce more stable Li-S batteries, which may help in exploration of the structure -property relationship between the host material and cell performance.

Challenges remain to preserve the biological structure through the harsh and laborious post-synthetic treatments, and tailor the functionality as desired. Herein, Escherichia coli is directly coated with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through in situ assembly to fabricate N, P co-doped porous carbon capsules expressing self-phosphorized metal phosphides. While the MOF coating serves as an armoring layer for facilitating the morphology inheritance from the bio-templates and provides metal sources for generating extra porosity and electrochemically active sites, the P-rich phospholipids and N-rich proteins from the plasma membrane enable carbon matrix doping and further yield metal phosphides. These unique structural and compositional features endow the carbon capsules with great capabilities in suppressing polysulfide shuttling and catalyzing reversible oxygen conversion, ultimately leading to the superb performance of lithium-sulfur batteries and zinc-air batteries. Combining the bio-templating strategy with hierarchical MOF assembly, this work opens a new avenue for the fabrication of highly porous and functional carbon for advanced energy applications.

Herein, we provide an easy and scalable procedure for the preparation of such cathodes. This strategy consists of an infiltration of sulfur under solvothermal conditions at 155 degrees C into pores of carbon-rich silicon carbonitride (C-rich SiCN). Porous polymer-derived SiCN ceramics possess a unique combination of high electronic conductivity and robust, stress accommodating mechanical properties. The impact of the initial porosity and elemental composition of SiCN ceramics on the electrochemical performance of SiCN-S composites is addressed in this work. It is shown that material pyrolyzed at 10 0 0 degrees C revealing a mesoporous character in line with the presence of a free carbon phase dispersed in SiCN demonstrates the best electrochemical stability and the highest capacity (more than 310 mAh/g over 40 cycles) at a high sulphur content of 66 wt.%.

However, the practical application is greatly hindered by the poor cathode conductivity and the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides. Herein, a leaf-like nanosheets composing of highly dispersed Sb2S3 nanodots embedded in highly nitrogen (18.9%) and sulfur dual-doped porous carbon skeleton (NSCNLs@Sb2S3) is designed for efficient immobilization and catalysis of polysulfides conversion by a facile approach. The conductive carbon matrix effectively enhances the conductivity. Nitrogen/sulfur doping species and Sb2S3 nanodots provide abundant stable active sites to anchor lithium polysulfides. Moreover, a series of fundamental experiments reveal that the Sb2S3 nanodots can boost the redox reaction kinetics and guide the polysulfide to uniformly deposit on carbon matrixes, leading to a stable electrode structure. Benefiting from the unique design of the structure and rational componential selection, the S-NSCNLs@Sb2S3 electrodes deliver a stable capacity after 800 cycles with a capacity fade rate of 0.029% per cycle at 1.0 C and an excellent rate capacity of 567 mAh g-1 at 4.0 C. This present work with facile synthetic process may provide a new sight for the designing and practical application of carbon-based sulfur storage materials.

Hierarchical porous spore carbon produced by Aspergillus oryzae is reported, which acts as a biofactory. Interestingly, the spore carbon not only shows a porous maze structure consisting of crosslinked nanofolds, but also is intrinsically N and P dual doped. Impressively, the spore carbon can be further embedded with Ni2P nanoparticles, which serve as porogen to form a highly porous spore carbon/Ni2P composite with increased surface area and enhanced electrical conductivity. To explore the potential application in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), the spore carbon/Ni2P composite is combined with sulfur, forming a composite cathode, which exhibits a high initial capacity of 1347.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, enhanced cycling stability (73.5% after 500 cycles), and better rate performance than the spore carbon/S and artificial hollow carbon sphere/S counterparts. The synergistic effect on suppressing the shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides is responsible for the excellent LSBs performance with the aid of a physical blocking effect arising from the electrical maze porous structure and the chemical adsorption effect originating from N, P dual doping and polarized compound Ni2P.

Herein, Graphene/TiO2 decorated N-doped carbon foam (G/T-NF@CNT) is proposed as three-dimensional (3D) current collector for high loading sulfur cathode. This rationally designed current collector can not only provide enough space to accommodate active sulfur, but also endow sulfur cathode with strong polysulfide confining ability. More interestingly, 3D porous conductive structure has sufficient channels to realize rapid mass mobilization; meanwhile the high conductivity networks boost transfer kinetics of electrons. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that G/T-NF@CNT/S cathode has a remarkable capacity of 788 mA h g(-1) (5.83 mA h cm(-2)) at 0.1 A g(-1) after 100 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 7.4 mg cm(-2). This work provides new insights on multifunctional current collectors for thick sulfur cathodes in Li-S batteries.

In this study, a new multifunctional network binder composed of chitosan and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is introduced to enhance the capacitive performance of Li-S batteries. Chitosan is reacted with graphene oxide in aqueous solution to produce a homogenous network, which effectively enhances the redox system by entrapping lithium polysulfides, reinforces the mechanical properties, and allows electrical conductivity through the binder system. Collaborative relationship-based chitosan-rGO network binder allows noteworthy improvement in the capacity decay of 0.016% per cycle at 1 C for 1000 cycles.

The long-term target of all Li-S research activities must be to outperform state-of-the-art Li-ion cells. A current benchmark is the Panasonic NCR18650B, which has a gravimetric energy density of approximate to 240 Wh kg(-1) and several hundred relatively stable cycles. The possible 18650 Li-S cell energies and cell costs are calculated for various sulfur loads, sulfur utilizations, and electrolyte/sulfur ratios with the aim of determining the cell and electrode property values required to outperform the NCR18650B. These values are compared with statistical information obtained from an extensive literature review of 274 Li-S publications over the last 12 years to show the gap between state-of-the-art Li-S research and requirements for high energy density cells. Finally, a carbon nanotubes-based electrode is introduced, which meets important criteria for obtaining high gravimetric cell energy densities.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, owing to their unique properties, have shown great potential for energy storage. Following the discovery of graphene, a new family of 2D transition metal carbides/nitrides, MXenes, derived from MAX phase precursors, have attracted extensive attention in recent years. The superior physical and chemical properties of MXenes include high mechanical strength, excellent electrical conductivity, multiple possible surface terminations, hydrophilic features, superior specific surface area, and the ability to accommodate intercalants. When applied as electrodes in lithium-based batteries, MXenes have demonstrated excellent performance. In this progress report, the authors summarize the recent advances of MXenes and MXene-based composites in terms of synthesis strategies, morphology engineering, physical/chemical properties, and their applications in lithium-ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries. Furthermore, challenges and perspectives for MXenes and MXene-based composites for lithium-based energy storage devices are also outlined.

Herein, we report an protocol for g-C3N4 template-directed in-situ fabricating nitrogen-rich porous graphene-like carbon sheets (NPGCs) by using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition followed with high-temperature pyrolysis process, which totally avoids the postsynthetic template-removal. The resultant NPGCs integrate a range of intriguing features including highly conductive interconnected structure (693 Sm-1), abundant mesoporous with ultrahigh pore volume (4.35 cm(3) g(-1)), large specific surface area (1277 m(2) g(-1)), high N doping (8.75 wt%), and good wettability. As supercapacitor electrode, the NPGCs exhibit a quite encouraging specific capacitance of 261 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), excellent rate capability (189 F g(-1) even at 100 A g(-1)), and outstanding cycle performance (97% capacitance retention at 10 A g(-1) after 20000 cycles), which outperforms most carbon-based materials reported to date. Moreover, the assembled supercapacitors deliver a high power density of 28.4 kW kg(-1) with a energy density of 6.53 Wh kg(-1) at 100 A g(-1).

The morphology of composites illustrates that the sepiolite is composed of many needle-like fibrous clusters. The initial discharge capacity of the post-treated sepiolite/sulfur/PAni composite is about 1230 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, and it remains at 826 mA h g(-1) even after 40 cycles with the corresponding coulombic efficiency above 97%. Such performance is attributed to the specific porous structure, outstanding adsorption characteristics, and excellent ion exchange capability of sepiolite, as well as the excellent conductivity of PAni. In addition, the PAni coating has a pinning effect on sulfur, which influences the consumption of the active mass and enhances the cycling constancy and the coulombic efficiency of the composite material at elevated current rates.

In this context, the clews of polymer nanobelts (CsPNBs) are regarded as sacrificial template materials, and Co-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOF) are in-situ growth on the surface of CsPNBs, after carbonization and activation, the Co-doped hybrid materials are obtained. The physicochemical properties of these hybrid materials can be changed by adjusting activation time and by adding some amount of CsPNBs. When evaluated as a cathode for Li-S batteries, the hybrid nano-architecture exhibits high initial capacities of 1300.69 and 1020.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 0.5C, respectively. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the electrode is closely related to the accessible pore structures optimization as well as Co-doping has cobalt and oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the matrix material. With the help of those advantages, the areal mass loading of the electrodes is improved. Overall, a rarely demonstrated study that involves the correlation between structure and performance of the MOF-derived hybrid materials is systematically elucidated in this work. This research study is crucial to the precise tailoring of the growth for the MOF-derived carbon superstructure to meet their demanding challenge as the electrode materials.

However, the all-solid-state Li/S cells have suffered from the low utilization of Li2S. In this study, for improving the utilization and understanding the conversion reaction of Li2S/S in the all-solid-state cells, Li2S-based solid solutions composed of Li2S and one of lithium halides of LiCl, LiBr, and LiI are applied as active materials to the all-solid-state cells. Capacity of the cells with 80Li(2)S center dot 20LiI (mol%) reaches more than 1100 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, corresponding to 95% of theoretical capacity. The reversible full utilization of Li2S is first demonstrated in this work. The significantly improved utilization of Li2S is originated by the increase of electrochemical reaction sites rather than the ionic conductivities of Li2S-based solid solutions. Furthermore, the cell retains the capacity of 980 mAh g(-1) at 2 C for 2000 cycles without capacity degradation. These are the best cycling performances in the reported Li2S cells with not only solid electrolytes but also organic liquid electrolytes.

However, the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) electrochemical cells face several formidable challenges arising from both the materials chemistry (e.g., low electrochemical utilization of sulfur and severe polysulfide diffusion) and battery chemistry (e.g., dynamic and static instability and low sulfur loadings). Here, we present the design of a core-shell cathode with a pure sulfur core shielded within a conductive shell-shaped electrode. The new electrode configuration allows Li-S cells to load with a high amount of sulfur (sulfur loadings of up to 30 mg cm(-2) and sulfur content approaching 70 wt%). The core-shell cathodes demonstrate a superior dynamic and static electrochemical stability in Li-S cells. The high-loading cathodes exhibit (i) a high sulfur utilization of up to 97% at C/20-C/2 rates and (ii) a low self-discharge during long-term cell storage for a three-month rest period and at different cell-storage conditions. Finally, a polysulfide-trap cell configuration is designed to evidence the eliminations of polysulfide diffusion and to investigate the relationship between the electrode configuration and electrochemical characteristics. The comprehensive analytical results based on the high-loading cathodes suggest that (i) the core-shell cathode is a promising solution for designing highly reversible Li-S cells and (ii) the polysulfide-trap cell configuration is a viable approach to qualitatively evaluating the presence or absence of polysulfide diffusion.

Herein, via a one-step scalable calcination process, a holey Fe, N codoped graphene (HFeNG) is successfully synthesized to address these problems. Diverging by the holey structures, the Fe atoms are anchored by four N atoms (Fe-N-4 moiety) or two N atoms (Fe-N-2 moiety) localized on the graphene sheets and edge of holes, respectively, which is confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The unique holey structures not only promote the mass transport of lithium ions, but also prohibit the transportation of polysulfides across these additional channels via strong adsorption forces of Fe-N-2 moiety at the edges. The as-obtained HFeNG delivers a high rate capacity of 810 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and a stable cycling performance with the capacity decay of 0.083% per cycle at 0.5 C. The concept of holey structure and introduction of polar moieties could be extended to other carbon and 2D nanostructures for energy storage and conversion devices such as supercapacitors, alkali-ion batteries, metal-air batteries, and metal-halogen batteries.

To address this, we demonstrate a high tap-density cathode based on polyhedral TiO2 (poly-TiO2) particles. The poly-TiO2 particles are obtained by fracturing 3D ordered macroporous TiO2 structure. Poly-TiO2 particles achieve high packing densities by assembly of surface-to-surface contact. Compared to commercial TiO2 nanoparticles, poly-TiO2 exhibits an apparent tap-density of about 6 times higher. We prepare a Li-S battery with a poly-TiO2 particle-assembled film as the host of the sulfur. The poly-TiO2 particle cell exhibits a volumetric capacity of 1145 mAh/cm(3), which is about 9 times higher than the TiO2 nanoparticle cathode cell. The poly-TiO2 cathode with high tap-density shows excellent performance in lean electrolyte condition. Under extremely lean electrolyte conditions with an E/S value of 2.8, the poly-TiO2 cell exhibits a high capacity of 607 mAh/g at 1C-rate.

J	Kilic, A; Eroglu, D				Kilic, Aysegul; Eroglu, Damla			Characterization of the Effect of Cell Design on Li-S Battery Resistance Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy	CHEMELECTROCHEM			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio; carbon-to-sulfur ratio; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; cell design		The effect of two critical cathode design parameters, electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) and carbon-to-sulfur (C/S) ratios, on the kinetic and transport resistances in a Li-S cell is determined as a function of discharge depth by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrolyte, charge transfer, and Li2S film resistances are identified as the major contributors to cell resistance. Both E/S and C/S ratios have a significant impact on cell resistance, predominantly at the early and final stages of discharge. The E/S ratio controls the cathode kinetics in the first plateau together with Li2S precipitation near the end of discharge. Consequently, the highest cell resistances are obtained for the cell with the lowest E/S ratio of 6 mL g(-1). Increasing the E/S ratio up to 19 mL g(-1) decreases the resistances considerably, no notable change is achieved after this point. On the other hand, the C/S ratio reflects a tradeoff between high electrochemically active surface area vs. sufficient and homogeneous S loading in the cathode. The minimum cell resistance is attained for the cell with C/S=1; any increase or decrease in the C/S ratio leads to higher resistances. The results suggest a mechanistic interpretation of the connection between cathode design and cell performance in Li-S batteries.

The as-prepared N, P-HPC with a highly interconnected network structure and possesses a large surface area and pore volume is very favor in the impregnation of sulfur. Moreover, simultaneously introduced nitrogen and phosphorous into the carbon could create more active sites than the mono doped carbons, the synergistic effects of dual activation of carbon atoms induced stronger chemical adsorption ability. Benefiting from the advantages of suitable hierarchical porosity, high conductivity, fast ion transportation, physical and chemical adsorption of the N, P-HPC, the Sulfur/N, P-HPC composite exhibits high initial discharge capacity of 1116 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1), based on sulfur content) and high rate capability of 550 mAh g(-1) at 2C, as well as excellent long term cycling stability at a current rate of 1 C with only 0.058% capacity decay per cycle for over 500 cycles. Such a high capacity and stability suggests that the novel cathode have alluring prospect for Li -S batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Water vapor is used to enhance the catalytic graphitization process by etching carbon layers coated on metal nanocatalysts to maintain their high catalytic activity, and the resultant hydrogen and carbon monoxide as strong reduction gases arising from water-gas shift reaction can promote the transformation of metal ions to metal catalysts. Thus, the resultant graphitic carbon exhibits hierarchical pore structure, large surface area and high graphitic degree, which is advantageous over conventional activated carbon materials in electrochemical energy storage. The applications of hierarchical porous graphitic carbon as electrode materials for supercapacitors, and host for sulfur in lithium-sulfur cells is demonstrated, which shows remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance due to the unique structure.

It is a versatile synthesis approach that allows the production of sulfur/carbon composites or porous carbons depending on the washing procedure used after the high-temperature treatment. By acid washing, sulfur/carbon composites with sulfur contents in the 62-74 wt% range are produced when cellulose is used as precursor. These composites show a good electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries, providing a capacity of 7.4 mAh cm(-2) at 0.05 C and 5.5 mAh cm(-2) at 0.2 C under high sulfur loading conditions, and still preserving 4.1 mAh cm(-2) after more than 100 cycles. Meanwhile, by water washing, highly micro-mesoporous carbons (S-BET >= 2500 m(2) g(-1)) with good electronic conductivity (approximate to 5-6 S cm(-1)) are produced when cellulose acetate is used as precursor. These porous carbons exhibit high capacitance values (170 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)) in an ionic liquid electrolyte, good long-term stability, and low self-discharge.

In the composite, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) form a lattice matrix in which porous spherical reduced graphene oxide (RGO) completes the 3D structure. When used in Li-S batteries, the 3D porous lattice matrix not only accommodates a high content of sulfur, but also induces a confinement effect towards polysulfide, and thereby reduces the "shuttle effect". The as-prepared S-3D-RGO@IVIWCNT composite delivers an initial specific capacity of 1102 mAh.g(-1). After 200 charging/discharge cycles, a capacity of 805 mAh.g(-1) and a coulombic efficiency of 98% were maintained, implying the shuttle effect was greatly suppressed by the composite matrix. In addition, the S-3D-RGO@MWCNT composite also exhibits an excellent rate capability.

However, the inability to durably incorporate polysulfides within the cathode structure results in a limited cycle life. Herein, we propose a CNT-based sulfur cathode with carbon-coated ordered mesoporous silica (c-OMS) to overcome the cycle performance issue. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies on the c-OMS prepared in this work revealed that the wall surface of OMS was evenly coated with an extremely thin carbon layer. The sulfur-CNT cathode with c-OMS retained a remarkably improved capacity (942 mAh g(-1)) with excellent cycling stability (91%) after 100 cycles as well as significantly high sulfur utilization in the first cycle compared with the sulfur-CNT cathode with OMS. This result may stem from the surface property of c-OMS with high chemical affinity towards electrolyte solvents.

Electrolyte Decomposition and Electrode Thickness Changes in Li-S Cells with Lithium Metal Anodes, Prelithiated Silicon Anodes and Hard Carbon Anodes	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Li-SM3 Conference	APR 26-27, 2017	London, ENGLAND				SULFUR BATTERIES; GAS EVOLUTION; LINO3	Li-S cells can have high gravimetric energy densities above 300 Wh kg(-1) when the electrodes and cell components are optimized. Low electrolyte/sulfur mass ratios or more generallly, the relative amount of electrolyte in a Li-S cell have an especially high impact on the achievable gravimetric energy density. A negative side effect of low electrolyte/sulfur ratios are low cycle numbers due to electrolyte decomposition and the possibility that electrolyte becomes inaccessible at the lithium metal anode when the lithium becomes more and more porous during cycling. Electrode thickness measurements were performed during cycling for various cell chemistries such as lithium-sulfur (Li-S) with different cathode sulfur loadings and porosities, lithium-hard carbon (Li-HC), lithium-silicon (Li-Si), prelithiated HC-sulfur (LiHC-S), prelithiated Si-sulfur (LiSi-S) and Li-ion. The thickness measurements provided information about mechanical stress and irreversible thickness changes. The thickness measurements also helped to explain different electrolyte decomposition behavior and they can be used to discuss the impact of thickness changes on gas analysis. The electrolyte decomposition of the Li-S standard electrolyte based on lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in dimethoxyethane (DME): dioxolane (DIOX) with LiNO3 was examined by online mass spectrometry (MS) within Li-S, Li-HC, Li-Si, LiSi-S and LiHC-S cells. Several electrolyte decomposition products were verified by post-mortem gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of Li-S cells with cycled electrolyte.

However, in situ imaging polysulfides evolution in Li-S batteries has not been possible. Herein, we constructed a hollow carbon nanotubule (CNT) wet electrochemical cell that permits real-time imaging of polysulfide evolutions in Li-S batteries in a Cs-corrected environmental transmission electron microscope. Upon discharge, sulfur was electrochemically reduced to long-chain polysulfides, which dissolved into the electrolyte instantly and were stabilized by Py-14(+) cations solvation. Metastable polysulfides prove to be problematic for Li-S batteries, therefore, destabilizing the Py-14(+)-solvated polysulfides by adding low polarized solvents into the electrolyte to weaken the interaction between Py-14(+) cation and long-chain polysulfides renders a rapid polysulfides-to-Li2S transition, thus efficiently mitigating polysulfide formation and improving the performance of Li-S batteries dramatically.

However, Li2S suffers from poor rate performance and short cycle life due to its insulating nature and polysulfide shuttle during cycling. In this work, we have proposed a facile and scalable strategy for the synthesis of nanosized Li2S particles via a solution-based method. For further application in Li-S batteries, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology is used to successfully deposit a uniform conductive carbon layer on the Li2S particles to obtain a core-shell structured nanocomposite (nano-Li2S@C). The average size of the as-prepared nano-Li2S particles is around 100 nm, and covered by a carbon shell with a thickness of similar to 20 nm. These nanoscale Li2S@C particles guarantee a short diffusion distance of lithium ions and the protective carbon layer allows fast electron transport as well as effectively constraining the migration of the soluble polysulfides. As a result, the core-shell structured nano-Li2S@C cathodes show outstanding electrochemical performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 1083.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and 766.3 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles with a low decay of 0.15% per cycle. The enhanced electrochemical performance is due to the core-shelled architecture with enhanced electrical conductivity and better suppression effect for the polysulfide shuttle.

The amorphous CoFe2O4 coating was deposited by the industry-oriented spray pyrolysis technique and carbon fiber was completely enwrapped by the coating. Compared to the non-coated carbon fiber, the coated carbon fiber as the interlayer exhibits a superior reversible capacity of 1086 mA h g(-1) at moderate current of 0.1C and a low decay rate in the capacity of 0.043% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1C. Excellent long-term cycling life and rate capacity were also achieved through the coated interlayer. The specially designed interlayer showed remarkable capability to trap effectively the intermediate LPS (lithium polysulfide). The significantly inhibited "shuttle effect" of LPS would give insight into designing and making the interlayer by using new coating materials for enhanced performances of the Li-S batteries.

The sulfurized alcohol composites (SACs) showed relatively higher sulfur contents (more than 60 wt%) and were revealed to be an amorphous structure by high-resolution TEM observations. Raman and XAFS spectra showed the presence of S - S, C - S, and C - C bonds, and the C - C bonds mainly consisted of sp3 components, which makes a clear contrast to the previously reported organosulfur materials where the C - C bonds mainly consisted of sp(2) components.

A ZIF-8/CNT composite is first prepared via a facile room-temperature water solution reaction and carbonized to obtain a nitrogen-doped carbon/CNT (N-C/CNT) structure. Then, the MnS/N-C@CNT composite is fabricated by a solvothermal method. By using the MnS/N-C@CNT as the coating layer of a Li-S coin battery, the shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides are greatly hindered. CNTs are supposed to be good Li+-ion conductors based on their large length-diameter ratio, and the ZIF-8-derived N-C nanocube grafted on the CNT has a strong lithium polysulfide adsorption ability because of its micropore structure. Furthermore, the MnS nanoparticles buried in the N-C/CNT matrix show chemical interactions with lithium polysulfides as well as the catalytic effect. Thanks to the above advantages, the use of a MnS/N-C@CNT-modified separator shows obvious progress in the specific capacity and cycle properties of the Li-S coin battery.

Studies on preventing Li dendrite formation in Li-S batteries by using pre-lithiated Si microwire anodes	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur; Dendrites; Si anode; sulfurcathode; Pre-lithiated electrodes; Battery	ION BATTERIES; LITHIUM-ION; ENERGY; COMPOSITE; CELLS	In this work, detailed studies on Li dendrite formation in Li S Batteries are reported. Li dendrites can grow rapidly, may pierce through or can easily grow around the separator. Dendrites can even lead to short circuits when cathode and/or anode are wrapped with the separator. By replacing the Li metal anode with a pre-lithiated Si anode, these dendrite problems could be successfully prevented and were not observed for more than 200 cycles. The here used Si microwire array anodes are examined with ether and carbonate based electrolytes and different charging conditions vs. a Li metal counter electrode and demonstrate very high capacities matching the theoretical values. Electrochemical pre-lithiated Si microwire array anodes are examined in full cells with binder free, sulfur infiltrated carbon nanotube cathodes (CNT-S) and various polysulfide or Li2S containing electrolytes. The average polysulfide chain length and the presence of LiNO3 in the electrolyte have a great impact on the cycle stability of the cell, next to the charging conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to its relatively low specific surface area (SSA) and undeveloped pores, the introduced CNT has limited contribution to the electrochemical performance. To solve the problem, we have synthesized a hybrid (RGO/CNT@AC) of graphene and core shell CNT@AC by introducing activated porous carbon-coated carbon nanotube (CNT@AC) among the graphene sheets. The SSA and micropore volume of RGO/CNT@AC are greatly higher than those of RGO/CNT. Moreover, RGO/CNT@AC shows superior supercapacitive performance compared with RGO/CNT in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance is up to 193 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1), much higher than that (91 F g(-1)) of RGO/CNT. Furthermore, RGO/CNT@AC also shows obviously better rate capability (138 F g(-1) retention at a high scan rate of 5000 mV s(-1)) and excellent cycling stability (almost 100% capacitance maintaining in cycling stability test). The significant improvement in supercapacitive performance of the RGO/CNT@AC hybrid should be ascribed to the abundant micropores contributed by the AC coated on the CNT surface and more diffusion paths existing between RGO sheets.

Thus, when used as cathode catalysts, the Zn-air battery delivers a fantastic capacity of 770 mAh g(Zn)(-1) at an unprecedentedly high rate of 120 mA cm(-2), with an ultrahigh power density of 197 mW cm(-2). When hosting 78 wt% sulfur, the Li-S battery affords a high-rate capacity of 967 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, with superb stability over 1000 cycles at 0.5 C (0.054% decay rate per cycle), comparable to the best literature value. The results prove the dominant role of highly exposed graphitic-N in boosting both cathode performances.

Here, we demonstrate a new class of nanomat Li-S batteries based on all-fibrous cathode-separator assemblies and conductive nonwoven-reinforced Li metal anodes as an unprecedented strategy toward ultrahigh energy density and mechanical flexibility. Sulfur cathodes, which are fibrous mixtures of sulfur-deposited multi-walled carbon nanotubes and single-walled carbon nanotubes, are monolithically integrated with bi-layered (pristine cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-anionic CNF) paper separators, resulting in metallic foil current collector-free, all-fibrous cathode-separator assemblies. The cathode-separator assemblies, driven by their all-fibrous structure (contributing to three-dimensional bi-continuous electron/ion conduction pathways) and anionic CNFs (suppressing the shuttle effect via electrostatic repulsion), improve redox kinetics, cyclability and flexibility. Nickel-/copper-plated conductive poly (ethylene terephthalate) nonwovens are physically embedded into Li foils to fabricate reinforced Li metal anodes with dimensional/electrochemical superiority. Driven by the structural uniqueness and chemical functionalities, the nanomat Li-S cells provide exceptional improvements in electrochemical performance (the (cell-based) gravimetric/volumetric energy density = 457 W h kg(cell)(-1)/565 W h L-cell(-1) and the cycling performance (over 500 cycles) under 110% capacity excess of the Li metal anode) and mechanical deformability (they even can be crumpled).

While the size of electrocatalyst always brings different catalytic behaviors for various heterogeneous catalytic reactions, it is yet to be explored for Li-S batteries. Herein, a systematical study of size-dependent catalytic activity toward polysulfides conversion and the relevance to electrochemical performance are reported, by constructing Co catalysts with different atomic scales from single atoms, atomic clusters to nanoparticles. Fundamental electrocatalytic studies are focused by probing the reduction kinetics and activation energies of sulfur chemistry. The single atomic Co shows the best charge transfer/kinetic toward sulfur redox, especially for the rate-determining reaction (Li2S4 <-> Li2S) as demonstrated by the significantly lowered energy barrier for Li2S nucleation/dissolution. This is owing to stronger geometric deformation of the catalyst with lower aggregation extent when it interacts with sulfur species, thus leading to decreased Gibbs free energy changes as elucidated by DFT calculations. The superior catalytic activity of single atomic Co promises a high specific capacity (4.98 mAh cm(-2)) at an areal loading of 4.3 mg cm(-2) over long-term cycling. The finding emphasizes the significance of the size-dependent catalytic activity to the reaction kinetics and the overall performance of Li-S batteries.

However, the relatively poor cycle stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides (PS) severely limits its further application. The functional modification of separator has been proved to be a meaningful method to improve its cycle stability. Herein, CoSe2@C-N/CNT is synthesized by in-situ growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using metal-organic framework (MOF) as a catalyst and followed by further selenization reaction. Due to its high specific surface area, porous structure and abundant bonding sites, the PS can be effectively captured and also be reversibly released owing to the cross-electron transport network composed of CNTs. Therefore, the lithium-sulfur battery exhibits an excellent performance after its separator is coated and modified by CoSe2@C-N/CNT. The initial discharge capacity of 1224 mA h g(-1) can be obtained at 0.5 C current density and the capacity of 975 mA h g(-1) after 150 measuring cycles, and furthermore the capacity retention rate can reach 79.7%. Even at 3.0 C high current density, it can still exhibit 798 mA h g(-1) initial discharge capacity. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is hindered by the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and the severe polysulfide shuttling problem. Here, we report the easy synthesis of a nitrogen-doped multifunctional nanocarbon hybrid decorated with nickel nanoparticles and its use in a conductive membrane for an integrated electrode/separator in Li/dissolved polysulfide batteries. The nitrogen-doping produces desirable polysulfide immobilization by enhanced adsorption and chemical bonding. The nickel nano particles act as electrocatalysts to accelerate the kinetics of sulfur conversion reactions. The assembled conductive membrane acts both as a conductive scaffold and a polysulfide adsorption layer that allows efficient charge transfer and effectively prevents polysulfide diffusion. Consequently, a Li/polysulfide cell with a high sulfur loading demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.115% per cycle over 200 cycles, showing great promise for use in advanced Li-S batteries.

However, the poor conductivity and large volume expansion of sulfur and the "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides (LPSs) have significantly hindered the development and successful commercialization of LSBs. Bean-like B,N codoped carbon nanotubes loaded with Co nanoparticles (Co@BNTs), which can act as advanced sulfur hosts for the novel LSB cathode, are fabricated. Uniform graphitic nanotubes improve the conductivity of the electrode and load more electroactive sulfur and buffer volume expansion during the electrochemical reaction. In addition, loaded Co nanoparticles and codoped B,N sites can significantly suppress the "shuttle effect" of LPSs with strong chemical interaction. It is established that the Co nanoparticles and codoped B,N can provide more active sites to catalyze the redox reaction of sulfur cathode. This stable Co@BNTs-S cathode displays an exceptional electrochemical performance (1160 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C) and outstanding stable cycle performance (1008 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 1.0 C with an extremely low attenuation rate of 0.038% per cycle).

First-principles calculations of oxidation potentials of electrolytes in lithium-sulfur batteries and their variations with changes in environment	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							HIGH-VOLTAGE PERFORMANCE; GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; ION BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL STABILITY; FLUOROETHYLENE CARBONATE; LINI0.5MN1.5O4 CATHODES; MOLECULAR CALCULATIONS; DENSITY FUNCTIONALS; POSITIVE ELECTRODE; HIGH-CAPACITY	Oxidation potentials of electrolyte molecules in Li-sulfur (Li/S) batteries and their variations in various solvent environments are investigated using first-principles calculations in order to understand oxidative decomposition reactions of electrolytes for cathode passivation. Electrolyte solvents, Li salts, and various additives in Li/S batteries along with some Li-ion battery additives are studied. Oxidation potentials of isolated electrolyte molecules are found to be out of the operating range of typical Li/S batteries. The complexation of electrolyte molecules with Li+, salt anion, salt, S-8, and pyrene alters oxidation potentials compared to those of the isolated systems. The salt anion lowers oxidation potentials of electrolyte molecules by at least 4.7% while the complexes with Li+ have higher oxidation potentials than the isolated molecules by at least 10.4%. S-8 and pyrene, used as model compounds for sulfur and sulfur/carbon composite cathode materials, also affect oxidation potentials of electrolyte molecules, but their influence is negligible and the oxidation trends differ from those of the Li+ and salt anion. Although complexations change the oxidation potentials of electrolyte molecules, they are still higher than the operating voltage range of Li/S batteries, which indicates that oxidation of the studied electrolytes in Li/S batteries is not expected under ambient conditions.

Herein, novel mesoporous hollow sulfurized aminophenol-formaldehyde resin (polysulfane)/carbon nanotube (SAC) spheres with covalently linked short-chain sulfurs (S-x, x <= 3) are synthesized using a self-template polymerization reaction followed by dissolution and vulcanization processes. The three-dimensional network of aminophenol-formaldehyde resin, the mesoporous hollow structure, and the vulcanization temperature benefit the formation of the short-chain sulfurs (S-x, x <= 3), suppressing the shuttle effect efficiently. The ex-situ analyses confirm that the unlithiated part of C-S bond could boost the electrochemical kinetics of delithiated reaction. Therefore, the as-prepared SAC cathode exhibits excellent rate performances and high reversible capacities at varied densities, even obtaining a superior structure stability and a very stable cyclability with a loss as low as 0.022% per cycle within 1000 cycles at 2 C. Moreover, the SAC could perform stably both in ester and the ether electrolytes.

J	Yang, HJ; Jung, YJ				Yang, Hye Jeong; Jung, Yongju			Effects of Polysulfide Nonsolvents on the Electrochemical Performance of Li-S Batteries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Li-S Battery; Polysulfide; Nonsolvent; DME; Cyclohexane; Toluene	LITHIUM-SULFUR CELLS; LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; COMPOSITE CATHODE; CARBON	The influence of a polysulfide nonsolvent on the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries was intensively investigated in two binary DME/nonsolvent solutions, namely DME/cyclohexane and DME/toluene, over a range of compositions. The discharge capacities decreased gradually with increasing nonsolvent content. In particular, Li-S batteries exhibited unusual potential profiles and rapid capacity fading with the binary DME/nonsolvent electrolytes of 60% toluene. These features were attributed to the phase separation occurring in the electrolytes during the charging and discharging processes: 1) DME solution containing lithium polysulfides and 2) nonsolvent phase. Incorporating a nonsolvent in an electrolyte solution was not effective in improving the Li-S battery performance. In contrast, this study suggests that the application of organic solvents with high polysulfide solubility and low viscosity are very beneficial in achieving high performance Li-S batteries.

Their electronic structures and surface chemical bonds significantly determine the adsorption and catalytic abilities for polysulfide. However, the surface compositions of the reported metal nitrides and their sulfur anchoring mechanisms are still controversial. Herein, the authors demonstrate the anion-substituted mechanism from vanadium oxide, oxynitride to nitride during ammonia-annealing process and systematically unravel the long-range disorder rock-salt structure of vanadium oxynitride with abundant vanadium (V) and nitrogen (N) vacancies by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectra, atomic pair distribution function, and density functional theory calculation. The defect-rich vanadium oxynitride that is previously considered as vanadium nitride possesses the enhanced electron delocalization of V, N, and oxygen (O) atoms. It strengthens the polar Li-N/O and V-S bonds, especially near V vacancy, resulting in a strong polar adsorption for polysulfide. Meanwhile, the vanadium oxynitride effectively catalyzes the breaking and conversion of polysulfide, improving the reduction kinetics during discharge process. The bifunctional effects render the excellent cycling and rate performances. This work deeply understands the sulfur redox mechanisms on vanadium oxynitride and nitride and promotes the developments of the quasi-metallic compounds/sulfur cathodes in Lithium-sulfur battery.

While less electrolyte usage leads to slow reaction kinetics. Herein, a heterojunction, MoP/MoS2 core with much defects and vacancies coated by porous carbon shell, is synthesized. Besides, the small particle size of MoP/MoS2@C facilitates a close packing to form a dense and porous modified layer on PP-based (F-PP) separator. The heterojunction with defects exposes abundant interfaces and assures an adequate local electrolyte availability and an improved electrolyte affinity that are beneficial for Li+ transfer. When using F-PP separator, Li-S cell performs well in the lean electrolyte. Apart from a high discharging capacity of 517.1 mAh g(-1) at 5 C in E/S = 10 (only half benchmark dosage), the cell realizes a favorable stability at C/2 over 500 cycles even in E/S = 7 (0.065% decay per cycle), demonstrating an effective polysulfides (PS) shuttling relief and reversibility of PS relating chemical conversion. All these enhanced electrochemical behaviors in lean electrolyte result from a three-in-one strategy realized by defects-included MoP/MoS2@C heterojunction, including incorporating the lithiuphilic and sulfophilic sites for PS confinement and electrocatalysis triggered by abundant S vacancies and Lewis and Bronsted acid sites.

A macroporosity of 50-80% arose from the Si(HIPE) hard template, while the soft template generated micro-or meso-porosity according to the operating procedure. The final materials exhibited a BET specific surface area of 400-900 m(2) g(-1), depending on whether non-ionic surfactants were used during the synthesis; moreover, their performances as Li-sulfide battery positive electrodes were investigated. We determined that the novel 2P5HF carbon foam presents more than 800 mA h g(-1) (150 mA h cm(-3)) of remnant capacity after 50 cycles, an unprecedented performance.

Herein, we demonstrate that highly concentrated lithium-salt electrolytes (HCEs) can disperse SWCNTs without using any other dispersing agents. Incorporating SWCNT-dispersed HCEs into a polymer matrix allows the fabrication of mechanically stable, electronically and ionically (Li+) conductive composite gels. Due to its high electronic conductivity and good dispersion of the electrolyte, the SWCNT/HCE composite gel is a promising electrode material for energy storage devices. As a demonstration, the composite gel is applied as a gel cathode for a Li-sulfur battery by incorporating molecular sulfur into the gel, resulting in stable cycling performance.

Herein, a free-standing cathode material was developed, based on Fe-doped NiSe2 nanosheets grown on activated carbon cloth substrates (Fe-NiSe2/ACC) for high-performance Li-S batteries. Fe-doping in NiSe2 plays a key role in the electronic structure modulation of NiSe2, enabling improved charge transfer with the adsorbed LiPSs molecules, stronger interactions with the active sulfur species and higher electrical conductivity. Effective promotion of the sulfur redox kinetics and enhanced sulfur utilization were achieved under high areal sulfur loadings. The stronger interactions with LiPSs together with the unique 3D structure of Fe-NiSe2/ACC also induced the transformation of Li2S2/Li2S growth from conventional 2D films to 3D particles, significantly eliminating the barriers of solid nucleation and growth during the phase transition of liquid LiPSs to solid Li2S2/Li2S. With a high sulfur loading of 9.9 mg cm(-2), the Fe-NiSe2/ACC cathode enabled a high area capacity of 9.14 mAh cm(-2) with a low average decay of 0.11 % per cycle over 200 cycles at 0.1 C.

When tested as anode materials for the lithium ion battery, the CuFeS2 QDs @C composites based electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performances. When charge-discharge occurred with a current density of 0.5 A g(-1), the electrodes exhibit a high reversible capacity (760 mA h g(-1)) for as long as 700 cycles, which indicates the superior cycling life. Detailed investigations of the morphological and structural changes of CuFeS2 QDs by ex situ XRD, ex situ Raman, and ex situ TEM reveal an interesting electrochemical reaction mechanism, a hybrid of a lithium-copper iron sulfide battery and lithium-sulfur battery. The direct observation of orthorhombic FeS2 by HRTEM and the existence of Li2FeS2 detected by Raman support our assertion. We believe such an electrochemical mechanism would attract more attention to the CuFeS2 nanomaterials as lithium ion battery anode materials. The excellent electrochemical properties would be derived from the unique structure, which include CuFeS2 QDs encapsulated in the carbon frame.

It is found that the presence of SV defect changes the local electronic structure of graphene and enhances the adsorption energy to Li2Sx (x = 1,2,4,8) molecule, especially for the insoluble final discharge product. When Li2S molecule approaches SV defected graphene, the S atom in Li2S directly connects to the C atom having unpaired electron in graphene. This unique S-C binding behavior is very seldom reported previously. Compared with other LiPSs, the adsorption height of Li2S on SV defected graphene is the lowest due to this strong S-C binding. At the same time, the interaction between SV defected graphene and Li2S2 molecule is also enhanced compared with pristine graphene due to the presence of unpaired electron, although the adsorption energy and adsorption height is smaller than that in the case of Li2S. Based on electronic structure analysis, covalent character bond is found between S and C atom because that the frontier orbitals of Li2S molecule and SV defected graphene have close energy and the symmetry also adapts. However, interaction between Li2S2 and SV defected graphene material is through a Li-C bond with ionic character, in which Li2S2 molecule act as an electron donor. The Li-C bond is also found when Li2S molecule is adsorbed on the pristine graphene. This work provides new insights to LiPS adsorption on carbon materials and gives inspiration to research on cathode of Li-S battery. Since it can work as the effective nucleation sites to enhance the affinity to Li2S, carbon materials with SV defect might be a good cathode substrate for Li-S battery to make Li2S particles deposit uniformly. Further theoretical and experimental research on the following growth of Li2S particle around the SV defect is still ongoing.

Cell energy density and electrolyte/sulfur ratio in Li-S cells	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Li-S; Energy density; Electrolyte; Electrolyte/sulfur ratio; Pouch cells	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE	Li-S cells have high potential gravimetric cell energy densities between 200 and 600 Wh kg(-1). To obtain a high cell energy density, the sulfur fraction in the electrode and the sulfur load per cm(2) electrode should be as high as possible next to a good electrochemical sulfur utilization. The quantity of electrolyte added to a cell is crucial for the latter, and an excess of electrolyte is generally beneficial for the electrochemical results. Existing publications on Li-S cells therefore use an excess of electrolyte leading to high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S in ml g(-1)) ratios as these enable high cycle numbers and good sulfur utilization. However, these studies do not take account of the high passive weight of the electrolyte.The high E/S ratios involved mean that the obtained cell energy density is below commercial lithium-ion cell level. To emphasize the impact of the electrolyte on the cell energy density we calculated possible cell energy densities from material test cell experiments for various E/S ratios, sulfur and carbon loads. Furthermore small pouch cells with only a very small dead cell volume absorbing electrolyte are created to examine ideal E/S ratios for a specific electrode. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report for the first time a straightforward and economic approach to synthesize mesoporous Magneli phase Ti4O7 microspheres by simply heating a mixture of elemental titanium and TiO2 in argon. The phase-controlled method utilizes the mildest synthesis conditions to-date with lower temperature and exclusion of flammable hydrogen gas traditionally used, and also avoids generation of exhaust greenhouse gases during carbothermal synthesis using sacrificial polymers. The produced S/Ti4O7 composite cathode with 70 wt% S loading efficiently mitigated the shuttle effect by both chemical adsorption and physical trapping of polysulfides. Consequently, this cathode showed high (88%) first cycle columbic efficiency, excellent cycling stability (capacity decay of 0.09% per cycle for 500 cycles), small polarization and good rate performance, significantly exceeding the performance of S/TiO2 and S/activated carbon cathodes with similar/smaller S loading. We anticipate that this work will provide new avenues for more economic and environmentally friendly synthesis of various Magneli phase metal oxides, and their exploration in LSBs and other fields.

Herein, facile synthesis of a new class of carbon nanostructures, which consist of interconnected N-doped graphitic carbon nanocubes partially embedded by nickel nanoparticles, is described. The hollow interior of graphitic nanocube induces internal reflection of EM waves and confines active materials of EC energy storage. Nitrogen functionalities implanted in graphitic structure enhance electrical conductivity as well as improve chemical interaction with active materials.

Herein, a facile and scalable spray-drying strategy is presented to construct conductive polar Mo2C quantum dots-decorated carbon nanotube (CNT) networks (MCN) as an efficient absorbent and electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. The results reveal that the MCN/S electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 1303.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, and ultrastable cycling stability with decay of 0.019% per cycle even at 1 C. Theoretical simulation uncovers that Mo2C exhibits much stronger binding energies for S-8 and Li2Sn. The energy barrier for the conversion between Li2S4 and Li2S2 decreases from 1.02 to 0.72 eV when hybriding with Mo2C. Furthermore, in situ discharge/charge-dependent Raman spectroscopy shows that long-chain Li2S8 configuration is generated via S-8 ring opening near the first plateaus at approximate to 2.36 V versus Li/Li+ and the S-6(2-) configuration in CNT/S electrode is maintained below the potential of approximate to 2.30 V versus Li/Li+, indicating that the shuttle of soluble LiPSs happens during the whole discharge process. This work provides deep insights into the polar nanoarchitecture design and scalable fabrication for advanced Li-S batteries.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a reasonably designed host to simultaneously meet the needs of sulfur and LiPSs storage and improve the conductivity of the cathode material. In this work, inspired by synergetic effect, we design excellent adsorptive TiO2@yV2O5 (y = 0.025-0.045) bifunctional composites. And the different compositions of matrix material can be fabricated via manipulating the amount of KOH, which combines the advantages of high stability of TiO2 and strong adsorption of V2O5. The V2O5 exists inside TiO2 and part of it is used to provide a cavity, which can buffer volume expansion and store LiPSs and sulfur. The other can enhance the activity and energy of TiO2, thereby go a step further enhance the reaction kinetics. In addition, this TiO2@0.040 V2O5/S electrode exhibits high capacity retention of 91% and 93% at 0.5 C and 1 C after 50 cycles. And the cell exhibits a small polarization (202 mV at 0.1 C, 202 mV at 0.2 C and 234 mV at 0.5 C). (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although various materials have been utilized to overcome these obstacles, simple and scalable methods are still needed for Li-S battery commercialization. It is shown for the first time that the layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of 2D nanomaterials can be used to controllably fabricate multifunctional separators that simultaneously trap polysulfides and suppress lithium dendrite growth. The double-sided "nanobrick wall" structure, constructed by MoS2/poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) hybrid in conjunction with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), provides a physical shield against polysulfides and the chemical adsorption of such species by MoS2 and PAA. At the same time, the robust and Li-ion conducting MoS2 layers strengthen the separator and regulate Li deposition, thereby effectively suppressing Li dendrite formation. As a result, a simple sulfur cathode battery with an ultralight separator coating (0.10 mg cm(-2)) is able to achieve an outstanding cycle stability with a capacity decay as low as 0.029% per cycle over 2000 cycles and a reversible areal capacity approximate to 2.0 mAh cm(-2) at 1 C. The proposed LbL approach opens the door to the simple, scalable, and economic fabrication of advanced functional separators for use in the real world.

In this paper, we synthesize SPANI/S composites with different S content in a nanorod configuration. FTIR, Raman, XPS, XRD, SEM and elemental analysis methods are used to characterize the molecular structure of the materials. We provide clear evidence that a portion of S was grafted on PANI during heating and connected the PANI chains with disulfide bonds to form a crosslinked network and the rest of S was encapsulated within it. Polysulfides and elementary S nanoparticles are physically trapped inside the polymer network and are not chemically bound to the polymer. The performance of the composites is further improved by reducing the particle size. After 200 cycles, a capacity retention rate of 80.4, 80.5, 87.6, and 90.0% is observed at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 C respectively in the SPANI/S composite with 55% S content.

Herein, intrigued by the amphiphilic nature of DNA molecules, we demonstrate a new class of DNA-directed amphiphilic self-assembly as a chemifunctional/multiscale-structuring strategy, beyond the previously reported DNA-mediated assemblies, and explore its potential application to lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries as a proof-of-concept. DNA-directed amphiphilic self-assembly enables the formation of various structures with a wide range of dimensional scales and exceptionally low bundle/junction electrical resistance, which are difficult to achieve with conventional DNA-mediated assemblies. The amphiphilic DNA molecules interact with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) through hydrophobic p-p stacking and divalent metal ions via electrostatic interaction. This results in electrically conductive DNA/SWCNT foams with hierarchical multiscale porous structures that can act as functional scaffolds of Li-S battery cathodes. Benefiting from the above-described advantageous effects, the DNA/SWCNT scaffold allows the resultant Li-S battery to provide significantly improved electrochemical performance.

J	Babu, G; Arava, LMR				Babu, Ganguli; Arava, Leela Mohana Reddy			Graphene-decorated graphite-sulfur composite as a high-tap-density electrode for Li-S batteries	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; LITHIUM/SULFUR BATTERY; LONG-LIFE; CARBON; CATHODE; POLYSULFIDES; CHEMISTRY; CELLS; OXIDE	Establishing the efficient electronic conductivity of a sulfur cathode without compromising the volumetric energy density and confining dissolved polysulfides within the cathode of the cell are first-order research priorities in the area of Li-S batteries. The emerging nanotechnology-based approaches, especially the use of porous nanocarbon in the formation of the sulfur electrode, stand to negatively affect the volumetric energy due to the low tap-density of C-S cathodes. In order to address these issues, we study the effects of the porosity and density of different carbons such as graphite, graphene and graphite-graphene hybrids on the overall volumetric capacity of the electrode. Although graphene-sulfur (GS) and graphene-decorated graphite-sulfur (GGS) electrodes show similar gravimetric capacities (similar to 1050 mA h g(-1)), the GGS electrode exhibits a high volumetric capacity (745 mA h cm(-3)) without compromising the electrochemical stability over 50 cycles. Furthermore, an excellent cycle stability of the GGS electrode over 100 cycles is achieved by coating a thin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) on the GGS electrode. Maintaining a high tap-density along with porosity is key in achieving high volumetric capacity in C-S cathodes.

Lithiation of Sulfur-Graphene Compounds Using Reactive Force-Field Molecular Dynamics Simulations	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; LI-S BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIALS; DENDRITE FORMATION; SILICON ANODES; ION BATTERIES; BASIS-SETS; LITHIUM; CARBON	We performed molecular dynamics simulations of lithium-sulfur-graphene compounds using reactive force fields, providing a time scale to observe atomistic features relevant to the microscopic behavior of the of the bulk of sulfur-based cathodes to be used beyond our present Li-ion batteries. The samples we used were set to realistic geometries through sophisticated protocols to simulate ultrafast reactions that occur within the picosecond range, thus allowing us to get some insights into the characteristics of the bulk material in working cathodes of Li-S batteries, which are mixed with carbon to increase the poor electronic conductivity of S. We report chemical speciation and geometrical data at atomistic levels. We observed that slowly lithiated cathodes were more stable and with higher density than those that were suddenly fully-lithiated. We did not observe molecular Li2S formation; however, we observed an amorphous solid arrangement with the same stoichiometry of Li and S, with S-Li-S angles of similar to 111 degrees and smaller ones due to the interaction between polysulfides that did not reacted totally. In addition, graphene keeps its planar shape; however, S(8)changes its shape from rings to chains. Lithiated structures are more stable with lower energies, and more close-packed structures than structures with Li already inserted.

Versatile structural and compositional characterizations confirmed the uniform growth and strong chemical coupling of nanostructured Ni3S2 on the N/S co-doped RGO matrix. Rich physical and chemical properties were revealed, namely, the large specific surface area and pore volume, which are beneficial for polysulfide capture, and the 3D conductive network supporting rapid charge transfer to the Ni3S2-polysulfide interface to improve the intrinsic equilibrium of the polysulfide. Specifically, the integration of similar to 28.2 wt% of Ni3S2 produced a highly pleated composite with the largest BET specific surface area (618 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (1.73 cm(3) g(-1)) among the hybrids studied. This typical material also performed the best in the battery test, recording ultra-high cycling stability over 1000 cycles at the current density of 3C with the capacity decay of 0.023% per cycle. As the sulfur loading per unit area became as dense as 5.8 mg cm(-2), the specific capacities were measured as 6.72 mA h cm(-2) (at 0.05C), while the capacity retention for the 200-cycle test (at 1C) was still preserved above 72.5%.

The obtained NG was demonstrated with enriched pyridinic-N doping and was employed as the matrix of sulfur cathode with ultra-high rates, reversible capacity and high coulombic efficiency. The improved performance can be attributed to the high conductivity of the NG and the enhanced adsorption energy of Li2Sn (n=4-8) on the NG surface. The NG can act not only as an electronic conductive network but also as a Lewis base "catalyst" matrix that promotes the higher Li2Sn to be further oxidized completely to S-8 as demonstrated in the cyclic voltammetry curve, which can thus significantly improve the sulfur utilization and cyclic stability even at a high sulfur loading of 75% (w/w) in the S@NG composite.

However, high-order polysulfides dissolve in the electrolyte and subsequently lead to the undesired polysulfide shuttle effect, which hinders the commercialization of Li-S batteries. To tackle this issue, morpholine molecules were successfully grafted onto a commercial polypropylene separator. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed and revealed that morpholine side chains could equally and reversibly grasp all the high-order polysulfides. This diatomic chemisorption adjusted the transformation process among the sulfur-related compounds. The modified separator battery possessed a discharge capacity as high as 827.8 mAh.g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. The low capacity fading rate, symmetrical cyclic voltammogram, and retention of the electrode morphology all suggest that the diatomic equal adsorption approach can successfully suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect while maintaining excellent battery performance.

Its development and application require to overcome several obstacles including the large volume change, the low electrical conductivity of S/Li2S, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LIPSs). In this work, the hollow N-doped carbon spheres (NHCS) decorated with nanosized SnS2 (NHCS-SnS2) are synthesized and investigated to host sulfur used as the cathode for Li-S batteries. Highly conductive NHCS offer a large specific surface area and robust confinement for active material S, while SnS2 nanoparticles provide efficient chemisorption of LIPSs and promote the deposition of solid Li2S. The NHCS-SnS2/S cathode materials deliver a high discharge capacity 1344 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a low capacity decay over 200 cycles at 0.5 C. The outstanding cycling stability at 0.2 C with high sulfur loading of 3.0-3.1 mg cm(-2) can also be readily attained. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to possible triple phase catalytic effect of NHCS-SnS2 and electrolyte, and such structure permits the full utilization of active materials from S-8 to Li2S.

Here, we demonstrate 2D partially oxidized Ti3C2Tx MXene (PoMXene) can be cross-linked by Sb, N coimplanted carbon (Sb-NC) through Ti-O-Sb bond to synthetize Sb-NC/PoMXene. It is shown that the nanostructuring Sb-NC/PoMXene provides fast ion/electron transport channel and robust 3D architecture to alleviate volume variations. Significantly, the interweaved polar interfaces benefit rich binding sites from Sb nanoparticles, N atoms, TiO2 and Ti3C2Tx towards polysulfides, and the Sb-NC could catalytically accelerate redox kinetics, thus efficiently suppressing polysulfide shuttle. As a result, the Sb-NC/PoMXene/S hybrids represent high capacity (1148.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1C) and long cyclability (570.6 mAh g-1 after 700 cycles at 2C). When the sulfur loading is increased to 4 mg cm-2, the thick cathode still maintains a high areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm-2 with a decay of only 0.10% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.2C. The studies pave a novel pathway to design nanostructured electrodes and promote catalytic performances in LSBs.

Prior to the syntheses, the feasibility of forming Li2S was first evaluated using FactSage by considering the phase diagrams of sulfur and different lithium precursors in reducing atmospheres; Li2O, LiOH center dot H2O, Li2CO3 and Li2SO4 center dot H2O all showed promises in producing Li2S nanoparticles, as confirmed by experiments. Argon and hydrogen mixtures were used as plasma gases, and a carbothermal reduction was implemented for Li2SO4 center dot H2O. In addition, carbon-coated Li2S nanoparticles were synthesized with downstream injection of methane. Carbon was shown to stabilize Li2S upon contact with ambient air. The Li2S nanoparticles were electrochemically tested in half-cells using electrolytes containing LiNO3 or Li2S6 as additives. It was found that adding LiNO3 to the electrolyte was detrimental to the electrochemical performance of Li2S, whereas the combination of Li2S6 and LiNO3 as additives doubled the charge and discharge capacities of the half-cell over 10 cycles.

Here, we report the construction of a continuous three-dimensional conductive carbon nanofiber supported TiO2-MXene heterojunction framework (TM-CNFs) via a one-step electrospinning-carbonization strategy, with MXene as the "energy band bridge" between the carbon substrate and TiO2 to reduce the barrier for electron transfer. Theoretical simulations and experimental tests clearly indicate that the TiO2-MXene heterojunction can accelerate the mass transfer process of LiPS at the interface. Meanwhile, the redistribution of electrons at the heterojunction interfaces accelerates the surface electron reversible exchange. Based on the enhanced conductivity, the strong chemisorption for LiPS, and the remarkable catalysis for the simultaneous conversion of the sulfur species, Li-S cells with a flexible TM-CNFs host demonstrate excellent rate performance and cycling stability (807.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C after 200 cycles, and 723.3 mA h g(-1) at 1C after 500 cycles), a high areal capacity and energy density (10.85 mA h cm(-2) and 1909.86 W h kg(-1) at a high sulfur area loading of 10.5 mg cm(-2)), and a high gravimetric full-cell energy density over 300 W h kg(-1). The present work provides a novel perspective on the design of electrocatalysts for LiPS redox and a feasible strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of practical lithium-sulfur batteries.

Conjugated Microporous Polycarbazole-Sulfur Cathode Used in a Lithium-Sulfur Battery	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							GRAPHENE OXIDE; PERFORMANCE; POLYMERS; CARBON; NANOTUBES; ELECTROLYTE; CAPACITY; CAPTURE	The electropolymerization of Conjugated Microporous Poly-1,3,5-tris (N-carbazolyl) benzene (CMPTCBz) was investigated using a range of techniques. After the potential window was optimized for the electropolymerization process, a fixed potential was found to generate a CMPTCBz with minimal overoxidation and a high BET surface area. The CMPTCBz was mixed with sulfur and used in the optimized preparation of CMPTCBz-S cathodes. Coin cells were assembled with lithium metal used as the anode and electrochemically evaluated. Results showed that the CMPTCBz-S cathodes with different sulfur loadings have excellent charge/discharge cycling performance with initial discharge capacities ranging from 800 to 1400 mAh center dot g(-1)S and a capacity retention greater than 80% after 100 cycles. This is due to both the enhanced electrical conductivity of the cathode and physical confinement of the generated lithium-polysulfides inside the pores of the CMPTCBz. In a further experiment, a high sulfur loaded CMPTCBz-S cathode produced an initial discharge capacity of 548 mAh center dot g(-1)S and a capacity retention of 95% after 100 cycles using an organic electrolyte. Analysis using XPS showed that the sulfur to polysulfide conversion coupled with the dual functionality of the CMPTCBz in retaining the generated polysulfide are the key parameters for this superior performance.

To enhance kinetics in high-sulfur-loading Li-S cells, it is important to first understand and control the deposition of Li2S/Li2S from highly soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) during discharge processes. Here, we presented a series of multiphase-derived self-standing papers with diverse electronic conductivity and LiPS affinity for highly concentrated LiPS discharge processes and explained the Li2S/Li2S deposition behavior in detail. We demonstrated that high rate capacity and long cycle life of as-assembled paper-LiPS cathodes can be greatly depended on their phase material with high conductivity and LiPS affinity. A high-performance self-standing LiPS host-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/cellulose nanofiber (CNF)/NiCo2S4 (3.5 mg cm(-2)) can catalyze 2.85 mg cm(-2) (based on sulfur) loaded LiPS to deliver a high specific capacity of 1154 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and a high rate performance of 963 mAh g(-1) at 1C. We suggest that the insulating phase defect of nano-CNF and both highly electronic conductive (above 50 S cm(-1)) and LIPS adsorptive NiCo2S4 can promote the local concentration effect of LIPS, thus contributing to fast and stable heterogeneous particle-shaped deposition of Li2S2/Li2S and leading to high kinetics of the LiPS cathode.

In this work, a systematic investigation is performed to understand the impact of these two variables over key Li-S cell performance parameters. It is demonstrated that Li-S cells' power performance strongly depends on the E/S ratio, while both E/S ratio and sulfur loading significantly influence the cycle life of Li-S cells. Low E/S ratio and high sulfur loading both give rise to fast lithium anode corrosion, which induces fast capacity fade and Coulombic efficiency decay. Pre-passivation of the lithium anode with an ionic conductor Li3PO4 protection layer only improves the Coulombic efficiency retention at sulfur loading levels much lower than the practical threshold. Meanwhile, increasing the concentration of LiNO3 additive in the electrolyte is found effective in sustaining the cycling capacity and the Coulombic efficiency over a reasonable usage window (similar to 200 cycles). The role of LiNO3 is the protection of lithium anode during cycling. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

Cyanometallate (e.g.Fe(CN)(6)(3-)), as a unique crosslinking agent, can induce abundant hydrogen bridges in the chitosan matrix and thus impart the composite with an intriguing aerogel morphology and remarkably increased surface area with mesoporosity. The synergies between two ubiquitous components are beneficial to fully expose and utilize sufficient active sites, enabling the composite aerogel to exhibit remarkably improved activity towards polysulfide adsorption and catalytic conversion. The aerogel catalysts can functionalize the commercial separator and endow Li-S batteries (even with usage of a simple carbon black/sulfur cathode) with a large specific capacity, excellent rate capability and cycling stability, and a large areal capacity. This proposed design idea can be expanded to produce various aerogels based on other cyanometallates such as Co(CN)(6)(3-).

There is a general difference in the way copolymers trap lithium during cell function compared to inorganic carbon-sulfur composites. Using a chain-like polyterpene copolymeric architecture involving the copolymerization of squalene monomer with sulfur (poly(S-r-squalene)), the first evidence for distinguishable differences in the entrapment of lithiated species, when using different copolymeric architectures, is provided. Investigation of poly(S-r-squalene) as an active cathode material via X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy and high-resolution solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) reveal notable differences compared to previously studied poly(S-r-DIB) (proposed to have a less branched architecture) between the lithium environments present during electrochemistry that can be directly linked to the copolymeric structural features. Subtle but pertinent effects based on the copolymeric architecture related to the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed from the electrolytic components are also uncovered through these techniques. This work offers a comprehensive study on poly(S-r-squalene) and reveals that foundational inverse vulcanisation conditions such as choice of crosslinking monomer can dramatically impact lithium transport and SEI formation for the copolymeric electrode.

Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is developed into a bifunctional host material to simultaneously address the challenges faced on both the sulfur cathode and lithium anode in LSBs. For the sulfur cathode, PAN is bonded with sulfur to produce sulfurized PAN (SPAN) to avoid the shuttle effect. The SPAN is accommodated into a conductive 3D CNTs-wrapped carbon foam to prepare a self-supporting cathode, which improves the electronic and ionic conductivity, and buffers the volume expansion. Thereby, it delivers reversible capacity, superb rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability. For the Li-metal anode, PAN aerogel is carbonized to give macroporous N-doped cross-linked carbon nanofiber that behaves as a lithiophilic host to regulate Li plating and suppress the growth of Li dendrite. Combining the improvements for both the cathode and anode realizes a remarkable long-term cyclability (765 mAh g(-1)after 300 cycles) in a full cell. It provides new opportunity to propel the practical application of advanced LSBs.

However, it is still challenging to develop sulfur cathodes with high Coulombic efficiency due to the polysulfide dissolution problem. Herein, we present a new strategy to improve the Coulombic efficiency by using nitryl grafted sulfur cathode, which is confirmed by in-situ XRD measurement and XPS analysis. The formed SEI layer on the nitryl grafted sulfur cathode could effectively trap the soluble polysulfide and avoid polysulfide migration from cathode into electrolyte, which allows significant improvement in the capacity retention of 80.6% after 450 cycles. In addition, a Coulombic efficiency of similar to 100% is achieved for the nitryl grafted sulfur (Nitryl-S) cathode, which is superior to the value of bare S cathode. The excellent performance is owing to the significantly reduced concentration of soluble polysulfide as evidenced by in-situ UV/ Vis spectroscopy analysis. Thus this strategy might open up a new avenue for practical application of Li-S batteries.

However, two of the key issues hindering their commercialization are the polysulfide shuttling and Li-dendrite growth, which result in severe capacity decay and serious safety hazards. Herein, liquid-phase delaminated birnessite (HxMnO2+x) nanosheets along with graphene and carbon nanotubes are utilized for the first time to create an "electronegative" coating layer for Li-S batteries to suppress the polysulfide shuttling and Li-dendrite growth. The as-prepared coating layer enables stable cycling of the Li-S battery with a low capacity decay rate of 0.04% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1C. In addition, a Li-symmetrical cell with the coating layer shows suppressed dendrite growth even after being cycled over 1000 hours at 1 mA cm(-2). This excellent performance is ascribed, in part, to the synergistic effect of the chemical and electrostatic interactions among polysulfides, Li ions, and [MnO2+x](x-) ions, resulting in a homogeneous Li-ion flux distribution and a mitigated polysulfide shuttling. The proposed concept of an "electronegative" bifunctional coating layer illustrates a simple and effective way to develop highly stable and safe Li-S batteries.

The CoS2 particle could immobilize the polysulfide by, catalyzing the redox reactions of soluble polysulfide to insoluble polysulfide. Besides, the employment of vapor growth carbon fiber (VGCF) interlayer between CoS2/Scathode and separator has a positive effect on physically adsorbing polysulfide. Consequently, the chemical and physical adsorption could exist in one Li-S battery system at the same time. As a result, the initial discharge capacity of CoS2/S composite cathode with VGCF interlayer is 1278 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 0.1 C. After 200 cycles, the capacity still remains as high as 701 mAh g(-1), which is better than the battery without CoS2, showing excellent electrochemical performance.

Here, we discovered that Li-S compounds exhibit supercapacitor like properties in a context-dependent manner viz., when Li and S atoms are entrapped in a conductivity cage of N-doped reduced graphene oxide (ND-RGO) supercapacitor derived from silk cocoon, it resulted in the formation of a superior hybrid Li-S-silk (ND-RGO-Li-S) supercapacitor. Interestingly, ND-RGO-Li-S proves to be a better supercapacitor than ND-RGO alone. Electrochemical properties of ND-RGO versus ND-RGO-Li-S indicated that the later has higher capacitance (similar to 10.72%), lower resistance (similar to 2.98%), and higher time constant or relaxation time (similar to 7.52%). Thus, in one of the first attempts, caging Li and S in ND-RGO supercapacitor matrix offers a new role for Li-S, as an improved supercapacitor, unlike its current application as a battery.

However, the S cathodes are still suffering from poor cycle life and low Coulombic efficiency due to 'shuttle effect' of lithium polysulfide. Herein, we report a novel and effective strategy to fabricate a free-standing Li-S battery cathode with enriched anchoring and catalytic N-sites host. Benefiting from synergistic effects of multifunctional porous carbon nanofiber host (g-C3N4@PCNF), the g-C3N4@PCNF/S cathode achieves good flexibility and excellent cycling retention, such as stable long cycle performance with a capacity decay of only 0.056% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1). The excellent performance of g-C3N4@PCNF/S cathode can be mainly attributed to: (i) the interconnected network and internal porous structure of PCNF offering free space for S-loading and volume change during charge/discharge; (ii) the 3D g-C3N4@PCNF host providing an efficient electron/Li+ transport highway for fast interfacial reaction kinetics; (iii) the catalytic effect of g-C3N4 promoting rapid redox conversion of S species and retarding polysulfide shuttling. This effective strategy has demonstrated great potential as good candidates for commercial flexible and durable Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The internal 3D porous networks not only offer a stable 3D electrode structure to accommodate the volume expansion, but also enable a high sulfur loading (80%). More importantly, the external semi-enclosed carbon layer maintains outstanding conductivity and further blocks polysulfide diffusion, which significantly breaks the limitation of a traditional carbon matrix. On the other hand, the YF3 nanoparticles are beneficial for forming more uniform fluorinating electrode interphases, achieving the excellent synergistic effect of chemical and physical adsorption to polysulfide. Therefore, the assembled Li-S batteries exhibit a high reversible discharge capacity of 954.2 mA h g(-1) with a decay of merely 0.043% per cycle after 600 cycles at 1C rate. Moreover, the discharge capacity decay can be as low as 0.029% per cycle during 800 cycles at a high current density of 2C rate. Even at a high rate of 5C, the cells still possess a favorable capacity of 636.5 mA h g(-1) while steadily operating for 700 cycles with a capacity decay rate of merely 0.056%, implying the great potential of this stable semi-closed cathode structure for industrialization.

However, it remains challenging to construct hybrid nanostructures with reasonable structure and rational composition to achieve high-performance of LieS batteries. Here, a coordinated nanostructure constituted of the Mo2C nanoparticles embedded in the micro-flowered high content N-doped (11.73 at.%) carbon substrate (Mo2C@NC) is synthesized via using protonated g-C3N4 as the template, which is used as the sulfur host for LieS batteries. Owing to the physical entrapment from the porous carbon substrate with special micro-flower morphology, and the synergistic chemisorption from pyridine N sites and polar Mo2C nanoparticles, the as-prepared Mo2C@NC can afford a high content of sulfur loading and enables fast/reliable sulfur electrochemistry. Given these, the Mo2C@NC based cathode with a high sulfur content of 76% delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1403.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. Even at a high rate of 2.0 C, it still shows desirable electrochemical performances with an initial capacity of 910.6 mAh g(-1) and superb cycling stability with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.001% per cycle over 500 cycles. Moreover, upon a high sulfur loading of 5.5 mg cm(-2), the Mo2C@NC/S cathode can still maintain decent sulfur related electrochemistry and achieves a high areal capacity of 5.56 mAh cm(-2) with excellent stability. It is expected this work provides a new perspective to the rational design of conductive and polar material that suitable for high-efficiency and long-lasting LieS batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, the polysulfide utilization was improved with the virtual sulfur capacity increasing from 538 mA h g(-1) to 1270 mA h g(-1). The increment in high plateau-sloping capacity is 43% while a much more significant 158% increment is observed in low plateau region.

However, the Li-S technology has not been successfully commercialized because of several outstanding challenges including fast capacity fading, low Coulombic efficiency, and limited rate capability. Over the past few years, considerable efforts have been devoted to solving the challenges associated with the sulfur cathode. In thismini review, we summarize our recent advances in Li-S cathodes, such as the understanding of the nano-size effect in sulfur materials, the design of polymer functional additives, and the realization of a novel in situ wrapping approach for Li-S cathodes. The current Li-S technology calls for a rational design of the Li-S cathode that can lead to excellent overall performance of Li-S batteries. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

Herein, we developed a molecular design strategy and employed three small molecules acting as interfacial mediators to the cathodes of Li-S batteries. The theoretical calculation results show that the incorporation of tris(4-fluorophenyl)phosphine (TFPP) has a strong binding performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the strong chemical interactions between polysulfides and the F, P atoms in TFPP not only modify the kinetics of the electrochemical processes in the electrolyte but also promote the formation of short-chain clusters (Li2Sx x = 1, 2, 3, and 4) at the interface during the charge-discharge process. As a result, an optimized electrode exhibits a low capacity decay rate of 0.042% per cycle when the current rate is increased to 5 C over 1000 cycles.

This process results in sluggish reaction kinetics and escaped polysulfides. In this work, a Gerber tree-like interlayer with multiple components was designed to fully mediate the electrochemical conversion of Li-S batteries and shorten the diffusion distance of polysulfides in the composite. The branches of the interlayer contained TiO2 and Co3O4 nanocrystals embedded into N-doped porous carbon, while the fruit was catalytic metal cobalt. The two co-existing chemical adsorbents ensure the restriction of polysulfides through S-Ti-O bonding and Lewis acid-base interaction. Moreover, the metal Co catalyzes the transformation of adsorbed polysulfides into low-order ones, which largely shortens the diffusion pathway, improving the reaction kinetics and preventing the migration of polysulfides. The cell with the interlayer exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance.

They have been widely studied since their discovery and have been gradually applied in various fields due to their quantum size, abundant surface functional groups, great biocompatibility, non-toxicity and photoluminescence characteristics. Recently, applications of carbon dots in the new generation batteries have also shown great potential. This review systematically summarized the research status of carbon dots in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), potassium ion batteries (PIBs), lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), etc., and discussed the applications of carbon dots in electrode materials, separator and electrolyte of advanced batteries in detail. Moreover, we also analyzed the challenges and development directions of carbon dots in batteries. This review aims to provide guidance and reference for the design and manufacture of the next generation of high-performance batteries.

It is shown that d-p orbital hybridization between the single-atom metal and the sulfur species can be used as a descriptor for understanding the catalytic activity of SACs in Li-S batteries. Transition metals with a lower atomic number are found, like Ti, to have fewer filled anti-bonding states, which effectively bind lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalyze their electrochemical reaction. A series of single-atom metal catalysts (Me = Mn, Cu, Cr, Ti) embedded in three-dimensional (3D) electrodes are prepared by a controllable nitrogen coordination approach. Among them, the single-atom Ti-embedded electrode has the lowest electrochemical barrier to LiPSs reduction/Li2S oxidation and the highest catalytic activity, matching well with the theoretical calculations. By virtue of the highly active catalytic center of single-atom Ti on the conductive transport network, high sulfur utilization is achieved with a low catalyst loading (1 wt.%) and a high area-sulfur loading (8 mg cm(-2)). With good mechanical stability for bending, these 3D electrodes are suitable for fabricating bendable/foldable Li-S batteries for wearable electronics.

The particles of the resulting oxide were used as additives to prepare the sulfur/polyacrylonitrile/Mg0.6Ni0.4O (S/PAN/Mg0.6Ni0.4O) composite via wet ballmilling. The SEM observation revealed that the composite morphology was drastically changed by the addition of Mg0.6Ni0.4O, from smooth bulky particles of S/PAN to rough nanostructured agglomerates with two times the increase in the specific surface area, favouring the reactivity of the composite, and a homogeneous component distribution. Cyclic voltammetry, discharge-charge tests and ac impedance spectroscopy have shown improved conductivity and electrochemical properties of the composite by the addition of Mg0.6Ni0.4O, leading to high sulfur utilization and interfacial stabilization in a Li/S cell upon discharge-charge cycling. The cell demonstrated enhanced reversibility, resulting in a discharge capacity of about 1223 mA h g(-1) at the second cycle and retained about 100% of this value over 100 cycles. Furthermore, the S/PAN/Mg0.6Ni0.4O composite cathode exhibited a good rate capability with discharge capacities of 887, 710 and 445 mA h g(-1) at 0.5, 0.7 and 1 C, respectively.

Enhanced rate performance of polypyrrole-coated sulfur/MWCNT cathode material: a kinetic study by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy	IONICS			English	Article						Polypyrrole-coated sulfur/MWCNT composite; EIS; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Kinetic properties; Cathode material	WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM/SULFUR BATTERIES; COMPOSITE CATHODE; IMPROVEMENT; STABILITY	Lithium-sulfur batteries have a poor cyclability and inferior rate capability due to the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides. To solve these problems, a sulfur-coated MWCNT composite (S/MWCNT) was coated with conductive polypyrrole (PPy) to trap the polysulfides and facilitate charge and lithium ion transport. From the contact angle measurement, it is found that the PPy coating improves the wettability of the S/MWCNT composite. Compared with the bare S/MWCNT composite, the PPy-coated S/MWCNT composite cathode exhibited improved cycle stability and high-rate performance. A reversible discharge capacity of 671 mAh g(-1) was maintained after 50 cycles at 3 C for the PPy-coated composite. The effect of PPy coating on kinetic property was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrolyte resistance, surface film resistance, charge transfer resistance, lithium ion diffusion coefficient, and exchange current density were evaluated from the EIS measurements. The EIS results reveal that the PPy coating increases both Li ion diffusion into the cathode and exchange current density. The as-prepared PPy-coated S/MWCNT composite can be considered to be a promising candidate for high capacity and high-rate performance cathode material.	[Kazazi, M.; Vaezi, M.

The excellent electrical conductivity and highly active lithiophilic graphitic edge sites facilitate homogenous coaxial Li plating/stripping around each VACNF and forming a uniform solid electrolyte interphase. The high specific surface area effectively reduces the local current density and suppresses dendrite growth during the charging/discharging processes. Meanwhile, this open nanoscale vertical 3D structure eliminates the volume changes during Li plating/stripping. As a result, highly reversible Li plating/stripping with high coulombic efficiency is achieved at various current densities. A low voltage hysteresis of 35 mV over 500 h in symmetric cells is achieved at 1 mA cm(-2) with an areal Li plating capacity of 2 mAh cm(-2), which is far superior to the planar Cu current collector. Furthermore, a Li-S battery using a S@PAN cathode and a lithium-plated VACNF/Cu (VACNF/Cu@Li) anode with slightly higher capacity (2 mAh cm(-2)) exhibits an excellent rate capability and high cycling stability with no capacity fading over 600 cycles.

The cheap and easy obtained CNTs slurry and metal Na were used as raw materials. NPC provided polysulfides (LiPS) adsorption sites and CNTs constructed the conductive network. The obtained S/NPC/CNTs cathode material, which has strong adsorption capacity and high conductivity, restrained the shuttle effect to a large extent and enhanced the sulfur utilization, especially at high current density. The synergy of N doping, addition of CNTs, and existence of mesopores enhanced the suppression of shuttle effects. When the S/NPC/CNTs material was used as cathode electrode for Li-S battery, a reversible capacity of 785 mA h g(-1) was obtained after 500 cycles, with an average fading rate of 0.08% per cycle at the current density of 0.3 C. The S/NPC/CNTs material also showed superior rate performance, and the specific discharge capacity maintained at 880 mA h g(-1) at 2 C rate. Moreover, the single-layered pouch cell with a nominal capacity of 200 mA h was assembled and could discharge at a current of 38.6 mA stably.

In this work, a modified template-removal process, soaking the pyrolysis product by hydrochloric acid solution, was proposed to optimize the graphitization degree, morphology, specific area, and pore size distribution of the products. The tests results demonstrated that the PC product obtained by a modified template method (M-TC) exhibited a transformation in microstructure such as an enhanced specific surface area and more plentiful hierarchical pores as compared with those PC materials obtained by conventional strategy. The potential formation mechanisms are proposed as well. When the M-TC sample loaded sulfur was applied as a cathode material for a Li-S battery, it delivered a high initial discharge capacity (1475 mAh g(-1)) and a stable discharge capacity (874 mAh g(-1)) after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. The modified template-removal strategy could bring inspirations on synthesis design and extend potential applications of commercial PC materials.

Herein, a sulfur-rich polymer is fabricated, which enables all the discharging intermediates to exist in an amorphous state without long-range order, promoting the substantial conversion of discharging intermediates and enhancing Li-S batteries' performance at low temperatures greatly. This cathode material exhibits excellent performance both at room and low temperatures. Even under an extremely low temperature (-40 degrees C), the discharge capacity can remain 67% of that at room temperature. Besides, in-situ UV/Vis spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that this organosulfur cathode undergoes a new mechanism during discharge. Li(2)S(6)( )and Li2S3 are the primary discharging intermediates that are quite different from conventional Li-S batteries. These results provide a new direction for a broader range of applications of Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Whereas a wide range of factors contribute to the overall performance of the Li-S system, reported optimization procedures typically focus on the development of novel structured cathodes. Here, the importance of often-neglected experimental parameters contributing to the performance of Li-S systems is demonstrated. Specifically, the effects of varying the amount of electrolyte, the salt concentration and the type of electrolyte additive are presented and factors that improve cycling stability are discussed. Some of the parameters, such as sulphur-particle size and the type of conductive additive used in the electrodes, affected the cell's performance less than might be expected. Long-term cycling (up to 500 cycles) with a low amount of electrolyte is demonstrated. Our results suggest that parameters related to the electrolyte are more important for improving the overall performance than those concerning the electrode structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The cobaltosic oxide/sulfur nanosheet composite electrode exhibits high Coulombic efficiency (99%), a suppressed shuttle effect, and a reversible capacity of 656 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 200 cycles, with small capacity fading of 0.219% per cycle, whereas its carbon sulfur electrode counterpart only retains a capacity of 386 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. The improved performance is attributed to the strong chemical interaction between polysulfides and cobaltosic oxide, and its facile ionic transport and enhanced reaction kinetics, which can effectively control the diffusion of polysulfides and keep them within the cathode region, leading to good electrochemical stability.

However, realization of Li-S batteries is plagued by poor sulfur utilization due to the shuttle of intermediate lithiation products between electrodes and its dynamic redistribution. To optimize the sulfur utilization, an understanding of its redox behavior is essential. Herein, we report a gel cathode consisting of a polysulfide-impregnated O- and N-doped porous carbon and an independent, continuous, and highly conducting 3-dimensional graphite film as the charge-transfer network. This design decouples the function of electron conduction and polysulfide absorption, which is beneficial for understanding the sulfur redox behavior and identifying the dominant factors leading to cell failure when the cells have high sulfur content and insufficient electrolyte. This design also opens up new prospects of tuning the properties of Li-S batteries via separately designing the material functions of electron conduction and polysulfide absorption.

In this work, MeV proton-induced X-ray emission (XES) sulfur measurements were performed in ex situ mode on laboratory-synthesized sulfur standards and precycled battery cathodes. The average sulfur charge was determined from the energy shift of the K alpha emission line and from the spectral shape of the K beta emission spectrum. Finally, operando K alpha XES measurements were performed to monitor reduction of sulfur within battery cathode during discharge. The experimental approach presented here provides an important step toward more routine laboratory analysis of sulfur-based battery systems and also other sulfur-neighboring low-Z bulk materials with emission energies in the tender X-ray range.

Here, we design and fabricate an integrated electrode with hierarchical structure and interconnected 3D conductive networks as a cathode of flexible Li-S batteries. The composite cathode exhibits high electrochemical performance and cycling stability. The initial reversible discharge capacity is 1312 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C with sulfur load 2.0 mg cm(-2), and the capacity decay rate is 0.09% per cycle within 500 cycles at current of 1 C. Notably, the composite electrode can sustain 15.2 MPa stress with 10% strain and retain structural integrity after 200 000 bending cycles, the highest number of bending cycles found to date for any flexible S cathodes. The soft package batteries with different sizes and shapes are fabricated, and they exhibit extraordinary flexibility and stability after bending and flattening over 2100 times. Moreover, their potential applications in rollable displays, flexible lighting, and wearable electronic devices are also investigated.

However, Li2S cathodes urgently require a solution to increase their poor electrical conductivity and to suppress the dissolution of long-chain polysulfide (Li2Sn, 4 <= n <= 8) species into electrolyte. To this end, we report a free-standing Al2O3-Li2S-graphene oxide sponge (GS) composite cathode, in which ultrathin Al2O3 films are preferentially coated on Li2S by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. As a result, a combination of high electron conductivity (from GS) and strong binding with Li2Sn (from ultrathin Al2O3 films) was designed for cathodes. The newly developed Al2O3-Li2S-GS cathodes are able to deliver a highly reversible capacity of 736 mA h g(Li2S)(-1) (427 mA h g(cathode)(-1)) at 0.2C, which is much higher than that of corresponding cathodes without Al2O3 (59%). Also, the long-term cycling stability of Al2O3-Li2S-GS cathodes was demonstrated up to 300 cycles at 0.5C with an excellent capacity retention of 88%. In addition, combined with density functional theory calculations, the promotional mechanism of ultrathin Al2O3 films was elucidated using extensive characterization. The ultra-thin Al2O3 film with optimal thickness not only acts as a physical barrier to Li2S nanoparticles, but provides a strong binding interaction to suppress Li2Sn species dissolution.

The assembly of two dimensional (2D) MXene and positively charged 1D CNT-Polyethyleneimine was observed to controllably address the key issues of sluggish ionic transport, and produce an integrate cathode with dynamic crosslinking network. Moreover, an antifouling separator is proposed by this strategy for the first time, which features well-organized inter-lamellar porosity, dual polarity and high conductivity. The antifouling separator is found to play a pivotal role in: 1) low-order polysulfide activation, 2) high rate cyclability, and 3) Li dendrites inhibition. Our integrated design realizes a long-term capacity of 980 mAh g(-1) at 5 mA cm(-2) over 500 cycles (sulfur loading: 2.6 mg cm(-2)). Furthermore, a flexible self-assembled cathode with high loading (5.8 mg cm(-2)) and superb mechanical strength (13 MPa), demonstrates an appealing areal capacity of 7.1 mAh cm(-2) and rate performance at nearly 10 mA cm(-2).

As molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and graphene have complementary physical properties and similar layered structures, they can be combined in specific ways to create heterostructures. This capability alleviates the weaknesses of the individual counterparts and optimizes their performance. Recent advances have revealed that the unique structure and morphology, as well as the continuous conductive channels of MoS2/graphene (MoS2/G) composites, provide more active sites, improve the conductivity, and accelerate the charge transport and electrolyte diffusion of the material. Thus, MoS2/G composites could provide new opportunities for energy-storage technologies. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent advances and potential applications of MoS2/G composites in energy-storage devices. More importantly, we expound the improvement in the electro-chemical performance of composites with functional materials and via heteroatom-doping. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for the future direction of MoS2/G composites.

However, the practical applications of Li-S batteries are hindered by the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur and capacity degradation resulting from the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, we demonstrate use of a tin-sulfide (SnS2) modified separator to facilitate the redox reaction involving LiPS intermediates and realize improved electrochemical performance in a Li-S battery. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that SnS2 exhibits a strong affinity with LiPSs and induces a rapid conversion of trapped polysulfides. As a result, Li-S batteries with a SnS2-modified separator exhibited an enhanced specific capacity of 1300 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C (corresponding to a high areal capacity of 4.03 mA h cm(-2)), which was maintained at 1040 mA h g(-1) after 150 cycles. Furthermore, an excellent rate capability is achieved with a capacity of 700 mA h g(-1) (2.17 mA h cm(-2)) at 5C. Additionally, the modified separator exhibited excellent cycling performance up to 500 cycles at 2C, with a low capacity decay rate of 0.0710% per cycle. The excellent performance of the sulfur electrode is mainly attributed to the incorporation of the SnS2 coating layer on the separator, which effectively confines polysulfides via both chemical and physical interaction and rapidly improves lithium ion diffusion. Moreover, the SnS2 coating layer greatly improves sulfur utilization and efficiently accelerates the kinetic conversion of trapped polysulfides.

A high areal capacity lithium-sulfur battery cathode prepared by site-selective vapor infiltration of hierarchical carbon nanotube arrays	NANOSCALE			English	Article							COMPOSITE CATHODES; HOST MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODE; GRAPHENE; CONFINEMENT	The widespread use of melt infiltration has to date restricted sulfur-carbon cathode architectures to only host materials processed as bulk powders with no site control of sulfur deposits. Here, we combine structurally designed hierarchical carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays with site-selective vapor phase sulfur infiltration to produce thick electrodes with controlled sulfur loading and high areal performance. Our results illustrate the critical role structural hierarchy plays in sustaining electrical connectivity to enable high utilization of the sulfur embedded in thick electrodes with high gravimetric loading. Here, a primary large-diameter CNT population provides robust conductive trunks that branch into a secondary small-diameter and high-surface-area CNT population capable of giving rapid electrical access to coated sulfur. Site-selective vapor phase sulfur infiltration, based on the capillary effect, controllably targets loading of one or both of the CNT populations to facilitate gravimetric loading from 60 wt% to 70 wt% sulfur. With the high areal loading of 6 mg cm(-2), we demonstrate 1092 mA h g(S)(-1) and 6.5 mA h cm(-2) and excellent rate performance with >60% capacity retained at 10 times the discharge rate. Overall, our work leverages site control of sulfur incorporation into a host cathode enabled by controlled CNT growth techniques to emphasize the important principle of "quality over quantity" in designing high areal loading strategies with high areal performance and good sulfur utilization.

Based on the total mass of composite, a high initial capacity of 782.4 mAh g(-1) with high coulombic efficiency of 97.4% is obtained, and after 50 cycles, the discharge capacity can still be retained at 580.2 mAh g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the tri-functional copper sulfide in the composite, which is electroactive to offer additional energy storage, high conductive to enhance the sulfur utilization and have strong chemical interactions with polysulfides to prohibit the shuttle effect.

The in situ formed Li2S/MC film cathode shows high Coulombic efficiency and long cycling stability in a conventional commercial Li-ion battery electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 + EC/DEC (1:1 v/v)). The reversible capacities of Li2S/MC cathodes remain about 650 mAh/g even after 900 charge/discharge cycles, and the Coulombic efficiency is close to 100% at a current density of 0.1C, which demonstrates the best electrochemical performance of Li2S/MC cathodes reported to date. Furthermore, this Li2S/MC film cathode fabricated via our in situ lithiation strategy can be coupled with a Li-free anode, such as graphite, carbon/tin alloys, or Si nanowires to form a rechargeable Li-ion cell. As the Li2S/MC cathode is paired with a commercial graphite anode, the full cell of Li2S/MC-graphite (Li2S-G) shows a stable capacity of around 600 mAh/g in 150 cycles. The Li2S/MC cathodes prepared by high-temperate sulfur infusion and SLMP prelithiation before cell assembly are ready to fit into current Li-ion batteries manufacturing processes and will pave the way to commercialize low-cost Li2S-G Li-ion batteries.

Herein, we demonstrate a freestanding three-dimensional super-aligned carbon nanotube (SACNT) matrix reinforced with a multi-functionalized carbon coating for flexible, high-areal sulfur loading cathode. By employing the sulfur/nitrogen co-doped carbon (SNC) glue, the joints in the SACNT scaffold are tightly welded together so that the overall mechanical strength of the electrode is significantly enhanced to withstand the repeated bending as well as the volume change during operation. The SNC also shows intriguing catalytic effect that lowers the energy barrier of Li ion transport, propelling a superior redox conversion efficiency. The resulting binder-free and current collector-free sulfur cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1,079 mAhg(-1) at 1 C, a high-rate capacity of approximate to 800 mAhg(-1) at 5 C, and an average capacity decay rate of 0.037% per cycle at 2 C for 1,500 cycles. Impressively, a large-areal flexible Li/S pouch cell based on such mechanically robust cathode exhibits excellent capacity retention under arbitrary bending conditions. With a high areal sulfur loading of 7 mgcm(-2), the large-areal flexible cathode delivers an outstanding areal capacity of 6.3 mAhcm(-2) at 0.5 C (5.86 mAcm(-2)), showing its promise for realizing practical high energy density flexible Li/S batteries.

To improve the electrochemical properties of a sulphur cathode, carbon and polymer materials are applied to sulphur composites: multiwalled nanotube (MWNT), graphene, CMK-3 and activated carbon; and polyaniline (PANi), polyacrylonitrile and polythiophene (PTh). These can serve conducting paths and a polysulphide reservoir to enhance the electrical conductivity of the sulphur cathode and effectively prevent dissolution of polysulphides. And the composites are categorised in two parts such as mixed type sulphur composites and embedded type sulphur composites. Among the sulphur-carbon composites, the hollow carbon capsule/S composite prepared by a geometric control and an infusion method of sulphur in sulphur carbon composite electrode, demonstrated the best electrochemical properties.

On one hand, the interwoven BCFs offer efficient conductive networks. On the other hand, the pores of the BCFM facilitate fast mass transport of the electrolyte and Li ions and accommodate severe volume changes of the sulfur cathode during charge/discharge processes. Furthermore abundant macro/microporous structures of BCFs provide substantial adsorption capability to remarkably suppress the formation of the Li2S2/Li2S layer on the cathode and extend the lifetime of the electrode by successfully confining sulfur within the carbon networks. Consequently, Li-S batteries with the BCFM deliver excellent electrochemical performances with a high coulombic efficiency (ca. 98%), low capacity fade at only 0.11% per cycle, and long-term cyclability over 300 cycles at a high charge/discharge rate of 1 C. This green, low cost BCFM can provide an attractive alternative for large-scale commercialization of Li-S batteries.
