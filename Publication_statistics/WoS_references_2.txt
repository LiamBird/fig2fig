However, the severe shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs) and sluggish redox kinetics during the cycling process cause low sulfur utilization, rapid capacity fading, and a low coulombic efficiency. Here, a 3D copper, nitrogen co-doped hierarchically porous graphitic carbon network developed through a freeze-drying method (denoted as 3D Cu@NC-F) is prepared, and it possesses strong chemical absorption and electrocatalytic conversion activity for LiPSs as highly efficient sulfur host materials in Li-S batteries. The porous carbon network consisting of 2D cross-linked ultrathin carbon nanosheets provides void space to accommodate volumetric expansion upon lithiation, while the Cu, N-doping effect plays a critical role for the confinement of polysulfides through chemical bonding. In addition, after sulfuration of Cu@NC-F network, the in situ grown copper sulfide (CuxS) embedded within CuxS@NC/S-F composite catalyzes LiPSs conversion during reversible cycling, resulting in low polarization and fast redox reaction kinetics. At a current density of 0.1 C, the CuxS@NC/S-F composites' electrode exhibits an initial capacity of 1432 mAh g(-1) and maintains 1169 mAh g(-1) after 120 cycles, with a coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%.

Here, a Fe(OH)(3)@GO nanocomposite, 10-20 nm particles anchored on GO surface, as a novel sulfur host has been developed for Li-S batteries, where the construction of Fe(OH)(3)@GO nanoarchitecture proceeds via electrostatic self-assembly process between the negatively charged GO sheets and the positively charged Fe(OH)(3) colloid particles. The wealthy hydroxyl groups of Fe(OH)(3) would appeal to intermediate polysulfides more strongly than Fe2O3, resulting in the surface chemical bonds between Fe(OH)(3) and polysulfides. On the other hand, GO often contains different functional groups capable of entrapping polysulfides via forming chemical interactions. These advantages of both Fe(OH)(3) and GO give the S/Fe(OH)(3)@GO cathode high specific capacity (1569.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C), good rate performance up to 5 C, and long cycling stability over 500 cycles under high sulfur loading. Compared to Fe2O3@GO nanocomposites, the enhanced electrochemical performance for the Fe(OH)(3)@GO nanocomposite could be attributed to both sufficient surface binding interaction and fast charge-transfer kinetics.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is impeded by fast capacity fading and harsh self-discharge. To overcome these issues, effort has been dedicated to improving performance by designing the electrode structure and composition, which is often expensive and complex. In this study, modification of the separator by a combination of commercial titanium monoxide and multiwall carbon nanotubes (TiO/MWCNTs) was first designed, which is a low-cost and simple preparation process. The cooperative effect of TiO and MWCNTs capacitates the feedback of the Li-S cell with a relatively high premier discharge capacity of 1527.2 mAh g(-1), and excellent cycling stability is obtained up to 1000 cycles at 0.5 C with a negligible fading rate of 0.057% per cycle. And the self-discharge behavior was improved obviously. When the time of rest was extended to 96 h, the capacity attenuation of the cell with the TiO/MWCNT coating was only 12.4%. The use of a TiO/MWCNT-coated separator is a feasible method for the commercial success of high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Even though the dissolution of lithium polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries and their consequent electrochemical performance degradation have been studied, the chemical reaction between dissolved lithium polysulfides and solid sulfur, which is called disproportionation, has been less emphasized. In this work, disproportionation during electrochemical discharge is identified in lithium-carbon cells with catholyte under practical conditions (the ratio of electrolyte to sulfur is sufficiently low asymptotic to 4 mu L mg(sulfur)(-1)), and concentration changes by disproportionation are predicted. To quantify the disproportionation in real time, an electrochemical method, which is a constant current/constant voltage test, is proposed from which the chemical/electrochemical kinetic parameters are derived. This enables us to evaluate the equilibrium shifts of disproportionation at different compositions of lithium polysulfides and the consequent changes in charge amount. The suggested methods are further investigated at different applied currents to elucidate the correlation between the disproportionation and S utilization at different applied currents.

CO2-Derived Synthesis of Hierarchical Porous Carbon Cathode and Free-Standing N-Rich Carbon Interlayer Applied for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						hierarchical porous structure; nitrogen-rich carbon nanofiber; CO2 conversion; Li-S battery cathode; Li-S battery interlayer	NITROGEN-DOPED GRAPHENE; LI-S BATTERIES; MOS2 NANOSHEETS; PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDE; NANOTUBE; COBALT; OXIDE; ELECTRODE; HOST	The combination of a porous carbon cathode and an interlayer having strong interactions with polysulfides is a very promising strategy for advanced lithiumsulfur batteries. This work prepares a hierarchical porous carbon through CO2 conversion using a reduction agent of NaBH4 with a CaCO3 nanotemplate. A free-standing carbon sheet is also synthesized by the CO2 treatment by adding NaBH4 to the conventional electrospinning process, which leads to significant porosity with a high nitrogen content of 15.5 atom % in the carbon paper and 30% reduced weight due to its meso-porosity, compared to typical electrospun fibers. This modified method induces lower density and higher active sites, different from the typical process involving further treatment and a mass increase to generate additional active sites to existing carbon surfaces. The hierarchical carbon is used as a cathode of the lithium-sulfur battery to provide high sulfur content and facile transport of the lithium ions. The resultant carbon paper for the interlayer suppresses the polysulfide shuttle and accelerates the kinetics of redox reactions. As a result, the cells assembled with them have a capacity of 707 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles cycles at 0.5 C. In addition, it can maintain capacity of 697 mAh g(-1), even at a high current density of 7.0 C.

Before immobilizing sulfur, BN is in situ grown on pretreated Ketjenblack through chemical etching and high-temperature calcination. It is indicated that Ketjenblack plays an important role in forming BN nanofibers with a diameter and length of around 10-30 nm and 5 mu m, respectively. As supported by various characterization results, sulfur is not only anchored onto the surface of BN nanofibers and Ketjenblack through S-O-B and S-O-C interactions but also infiltrated into the micro-/mesopores of BN-Ketjenblack-xKOH substrates. The BN nanofibers act as not only S and polysulfide adsorbents but also as catalysts of the lithiation/delithiation process. The lithium-sulfur batteries with the BN-Ketjenblack-1KOH@S cathode deliver a first discharge capacity of 1822.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, which is higher than the theoretical capacity (1675 mAh g(-1)) of sulfur caused by the adsorption and catalysis of BN, and an enlarged interlayer distance of graphene. Meanwhile, it also delivers an initial capacity of 1150.9 mAh g(-1) and a high capacity retention of 51.6% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles at 2 C. This work provides a methodology for preparing a cathode material for multifunctional lithium-sulfur batteries with enhanced electrochemical performance.

However, Li-S batteries suffer from low sulfur loading, poor charge transport, and dissolution of lithium polysulfide. In our study, we use the lithiated S, Li2S, as the cathode material, coupled with electrospun TiO2-impregnated hollow carbon nanofibers (TiO2-HCFs), which serve as the conductive agent and protective barrier for Li2S in Li-S batteries. TiO2-HCFs provide much improved electron/ionic conductivity and serve as a physical barrier, which prevents the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. The Li2S/TiO2-HCF composite delivers a discharge capacity of 851 mA h g(Li2S)(-1) at 0.1C and the bilayer TiO2-HCFs/Li2S/TiO2-HCF composite delivers a high specific capacity of 400 mA h g(Li2S)(-1) at 5C.

Herein, a significant improvement of conversion kinetics and areal sulfur loading is achieved using an ordered microchannel graphene scaffold with incorporated catalytic Fe3O4 nanocrystals and porous carbon as a multifunctional sulfur host. The synergy between the polar catalytic Fe3O4 nanocrystals and porous carbon frameworks enables a strong polysulfide anchoring effect and a fast polysulfide conversion rate. Thus, the 3D ternary Fe3O4/porous carbon/graphene aerogel demonstrates an ultrahigh rate performance of 755 mA h g(-1) at 3C and a high areal capacity of 6.24 mA h cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of 7.7 mg cm(-2). Moreover, the promoted reaction kinetics and reliable cyclability are revealed by the visible evolution of polysulfides using in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the enhanced chemical anchoring of polysulfides is disclosed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a promising approach to develop multifunctional ordered porous aerogels with metal oxide nanocrystals for high-performance Li-S batteries, especially those which suffer from low sulfur loading and inferior rate performance.

The construction of modified functional separator is an effective strategy to obstruct the diffusion of polysulfides. We report boron-doped graphene and activated carbon (B-G/AC)-modified functional separator for Li/S batteries. The B-G/AC composites are obtained via a one-step hydrothermal method and used as a functional layer to modify the battery separator. The B-G with highly porous three-dimensional (3D) network structure exhibits good electrical conductivity, and rich porous structure AC increases the specific surface area of the B-G/AC composite. The carbon coating layer can act as the second collector, utilizing the inactivated sulfur that is freed in the electrolyte. The modified separator can facilitate the polysulfide dissolution and migration towards the anode. The B-G/AC samples exhibit excellent electrochemical performances. The B-G/AC samples maintain a higher capacity of 1062mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C than a routine separator (709mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C). Diffusion experiments of polysulfides in U-shaped bottles also proved importance of B-G/AC as a separator. In addition, the B-G/AC samples also exhibit excellent cycling stability over 300 cycles, delivering a discharge capacity of 534mAhg(-1) when the current is 1C. The present study confirms that separator modification is an effective technique that leads to good electrochemical performance.

In this study, a copolymer micelle crosslinked binder (FNA) for lithium-sulfur batteries was successfully synthesized through a one-pot environmentally friendly approach. The micelles were used as crosslinkers and carriers for the electrolyte. The FNA binder provided multiple lithium-ion diffusion pathways to increase the lithium-ion diffusion, which reduced the polarization of the sulfur cathode during the cycling process. The lithium-ion diffusion pathways of the FNA were provided by the electrolyte hosted in the micelles, the polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide segments, and the carboxylate and sulfonate groups in the FNA. In addition, FNA possesses strong lithium polysulfides adsorption and high adhesion properties. Therefore, the electrode with the FNA binder presented a reversible capacity of 571 mAh g(-1) with a capacity fade of 0.032 % after 1000 cycles at a cycling rate of 0.5 C, which is much higher than those of the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sulfur cathode.

But the shuttle effect is still a thorny issue in the development process. The N, O co-doped chlorella-based biomass carbon (CBBC) synthesized by chemical activation method possesses a microporous and mesoporous composite structure, large specific surface area, and good electrical conductivity. The CBBC interlayer can improve the wettability between the separator and the electrolyte, and accelerate the transmission of Li+. N, O heteroatoms have a strong chemical adsorption operation for LiPs. The modified separator restrains lithium polysulfide through physical barriers and chemical adsorption, and improves the capacity and cycle performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. The batteries with CBBC exhibit excellent cycling stability (0.067% per cycle at 0.5C) and better rate performance (918 mAh g(-1) at 2C). The first discharge capacity at 0.05C was 1540 mAh g(-1). Even after 600 cycles the discharge capacity retains 656 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C. The low price and simple preparation of CBBC interlayer is an attractive choice for improving lithium-sulfur batteries.

Although carbon-based interlayers have been widely used to inhibit the detrimental shuttle effect in Li-S batteries, the weak physical adsorption of pure carbon materials for trapping polysulfides still leads to low recycle efficiency of active species and short cycle life for cells. Herein, we report a cyclized-polyacrylonitrile-cast carbon nanofiber (CP@CNF) film as an interlayer in Li-S batteries. By exploiting the CP@CNF interlayer, the batteries assembled with bare sulfur cathodes deliver superior rate capability and cycle stability. The reversible capacity could be maintained at 710 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.3C and a capacity of 560 mA h g(-1) can be obtained even at a 2C rate. The improved performances are attributed to both the abundant pyridine groups in the cyclized polyacrylonitrile matrix, which can entrap polysulfides by strong interatomic attraction, and the three-dimensional porous conductive network composed of the carbon nanofiber skeleton and conjugated polymer matrix, giving rise to highly effective transfer pathways for electrons and ions.

J	Yan, W; Yan, KY; Kuang, GC; Jin, Z				Yan, Wen; Yan, Kun-Yun; Kuang, Gui-Chao; Jin, Zhong			Fluorinated quinone derived organosulfur copolymer cathodes for long-cycling, thermostable and flexible lithium-sulfur batteries	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Polymeric cathode materials; Organosulfur copolymers; Shuttle effect; Thermostability and flexibility	ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; ELEMENTAL-SULFUR; CARBON; NETWORK; POLYMER; RICH; CONDUCTIVITY; POLYSULFIDES; ELECTRODES; STABILITY	Organosulfur copolymers are promising cathode materials in lithium-sulfur batteries because of adjustable molecular structure, tunable electrochemical properties and excellent processability. However, conventional organosulfur copolymers suffer from poor electronic/ionic conductivity and low sulfur content, which limit rate capability and energy density. Herein, fluorinated quinone-derived organics are copolymerized with sulfur via convenient nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction. The homogeneous distribution of sulfur over poly (tetrafluorohydroquinone)-sulfur (PTFHQS) at molecular level endows excellent Li+ ion diffusivity and fast redox kinetics. The abundant semi-ionic C-F bonds with polar characteristic have strong interactions with polysulfides, thus diminishing the shuttle effect. In result, flexible PTFHQS cathode with similar to 71 wt% sulfur content exhibits high discharge capacity of 643 mAh g(total)(-1) (906 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) ) at 0.5C, stable Coulombic efficiency (>99%), good rate performance of 307 mAh g(total)(-1) (432 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) ) 2.0C, excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 87% for 600cycles), and functions normally at elevated working temperature (80 degrees C). Compared to another copolymer of sulfurized tetrafluoro-p-benzoquinone monomer (TFBQS), molecular structure characterization and electrochemical analysis verifies that pre-polymerized skeleton of PTFHQS is conducive to the homogeneous distribution and efficient utilization of sulfur species. We expect this work will bring inspiration to exploit organosulfur compounds with rational molecular structures and convenient synthesis routes for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Aiming at these problems, a biomimetic design of cofactor-assisted artificial enzyme catalyst, melamine (MM) crosslinked hemin on carboxylated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (i.e., [CNTs-MM-hemin]), is presented to efficiently convert polysulfides. The MM cofactors bind with the hemin artificial enzymes and CNT conductive substrates through FeN5 coordination and/or covalent amide bonds to provide high and durable catalytic activity for polysulfide conversions, while pi-pi conjugations between hemin and CNTs and multiple Li-bond networks offered by MM endow the cathode with good electronic/Li+ transmission ability. This synergistic mechanism enables rapid sulfur reaction kinetics, alleviated polysulfide shuttling, and an ultralow (<1.3%) loss of hemin active sites in electrolyte, which is approximate to 60 times lower than those of noncovalent crosslinked samples. As a result, the Li-S battery using [CNTs-MM-hemin] cathode retains a capacity of 571 mAh g(-1) after 900 cycles at 1C with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle. Even under raising sulfur loadings up to 7.5 mg cm(-2), the cathode still can steadily run 110 cycles with a capacity retention of 83%.

Herein, we describe an on-site adsorption strategy toward superior stability of sulfur electrode by encapsulating elemental sulfur into mesoporous TiO2 host. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements obviously indicate that elemental sulfur (S) occupy the mesopores of the TiO2 host, forming a core-shell liked nanostructure. The TiO2/S composite exhibits a superior cycling stability and high Coulombic efficiency during the charge/discharge process. Even at a high current rate of 1 C, the TiO2/S composite shows an initial specific capacity of 650 mAh g(-1) and a specific retention of 89% after 100 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performances are critical related to the significant roles TiO2 host played during the electrochemical reaction. Firstly, the nano-sized TiO2 (similar to 5 nm) traps the polysulfides via chemical bonding interaction to prevent their dissolution and minimize the "shuttle effect". More importantly, the in situ formed LixTiO2, acting as a mixed electric/ionic conductor, facilitates easier Li+/e(-) transport. The unique functions of the TiO2 plus its easy availability make the current study conceptually provides new opportunities to reach long-term cycling stability of sulfur cathode using carbon-free hosts.

To address these issues, a unique hierarchical porous architecture, combining highly conductive ordered macroporous skeleton and embedded microporous particles is rationally designed as a dual-effective polysulfide immobilizer and conversion promoter. In this nanoporous architecture, Al-doped ZnO (AZO) acts as a conductive macroporous framework, profiting chemical anchoring of LiPS as well as facilitating electrolyte infiltration and ion diffusion; Co nanoparticle-anchored N-doped carbon (Co-NC) derived from CoZn-metal-organic framework is embedded in the macropores to further strengthen the LiPS adsorption, catalytically accelerating conversion kinetics of LiPS simultaneously. Consequently, the Co-NC@AZO/S cathode delivers a notable rate capability of 635.5 mA h g(-1) at 5 C. A high area capacity of about 5.8 mA h cm(-2) with a mass loading of 6.8 mg cm(-2) is also achieved under a lean electrolyte (E/S = 5.7). Additionally, the Li-S pouch cells equipped with Co-NC@AZO can be extended to sulfur loading as high as 4.0 mg cm(-2), delivering a superb capability of 897.5 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. This work puts forward a design for stably cycled and practically viable Li-S batteries.

However, the low sulfur loading in the cathode for Li-S battery greatly offsets its advantage in high energy density and limits the practical applications of such battery concepts. Flexible energy storage devices are also becoming increasingly important for future applications but are limited by the lack of suitable lightweight electrode materials with robust electrochemical performance under cyclic mechanical strain. Here, we proposed an effective strategy to obtain flexible Li-S battery electrodes with high energy density, high power density, and long cyclic life by adopting graphene foam-based electrodes. Graphene foam can provide a highly electrically conductive network, robust mechanical support and sufficient space for a high sulfur loading. The sulfur loading in graphene foam-based electrodes can be tuned from 3.3 to 10.1 mg cm(-2). The electrode with 10.1 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading could deliver an extremely high areal capacity of 13.4 mAh cm(-2), much higher than the commonly reported Li-S electrodes and commercially used lithium cobalt oxide cathode with a value of similar to 3-4 mAh cm(-2). Meanwhile, the high sulfur-loaded electrodes retain a high rate performance with reversible capacities higher than 450 mAh g(-1) under a large current density of 6 A g(-1) and preserve stable cycling performance with similar to 0.07% capacity decay per cycle over 1000 cycles. These impressive results indicate that such electrodes could enable high performance, fast-charging, and flexible Li-S batteries that show stable performance over extended charge/ discharge cycling.

Herein, a wood-inspired multi-channel tubular graphene (MCTG) architecture is fabricated by template-directed chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The multi-channel template is assembled via a facile hydrothermal and freeze-drying method with Si as precursor. The unique multi-channel tubular graphene architecture reveals distinct advantages for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The curved tubular interior space with a pore volume of 2.141 cm(3) g(-1) can accommodate active sulfur and anchor soluble polysulfides, while the 3D multi-channel network favors rapid mass transport and ion diffusion. Furthermore, the CVD grown few-layer graphene offers good electron conductivity, while the enlarged (002) spacing (0.35-0.41 nm) of graphene layers provide more space for sulfur storage and Li+ diffusion. Benefiting from these merits, the MCTG/S cathode (loaded with 70 wt% sulfur) achieves a high initial discharge capacity of 1390 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C rate, excellent rate capability up to 8 C and a slow capacity decay rate of 0.078% per cycle during 500 cycles. This type of MCTG will also play an important role in gas adsorption, solar steam generation, catalysis, and so on. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The harsh shuttling effect, poor electroconductibility of sulfur, and volume change affect the Li-S battery's practical application. Herein, the rational design of porous hollow carbon aerogel (PHCA) with an ultra-high specific surface area of 2054.5 m(2) g(-1) and outstanding adsorption ability is firstly fabricated to restrict the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by using commercialized nano-CaCO3 as a template. As a sulfur host, the S/PHCA cathode delivers initially discharge specific capacity of 992.7 mAh g(-1) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 97.6%. After 200 cycles, it obtains the reversible specific capacities of 600.1 mAh g(-1) for S/PHCA cathode at 0.1C (2.2 mg cm(-2)) corresponding to 60.45% of their initial discharge specific capacity. As a PHCA interlayer, the Li-S battery with the PHCA interlayer exhibits initially discharge specific capacity of 1267.7 mAh g(-1) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.36% at 0.1C (3.2 mg cm(-2)) and maintains at 863.3 mAh g(-1) with the discharge specific capacity retention rate of 69.2%. This is an effective strategy to improve the outstanding electrochemical performance which is beyond reported carbon materials, which is attributed to stronger adsorption of LiPSs by the micropore. This work provides a new direction for the modification of a sulfur host and interlayer and simultaneously reveals the relationship between the heteroatom distribution and LiPSs.

Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) with high theoretical energy density may be the next generation of lithium-based batteries. However, LSBs still have their challenges at low temperatures, including accumulation of lithium polysulfide, nucleation of lithium sulfide, lithium deposition, and formation of solid electrolyte interphase film, solvation degree and so on. Electrolytes of LSBs are partially responsible for these issues. To facilitate further research and development of LSBs particularly operated at sub-zero temperatures, this paper reviews the electrolytes of LSBs in terms of electrolyte materials, characterization, functional mechanisms, and performance optimization. The recent advances in electrolyte design strategies, including solvent optimization, lithium salt modification, additive introduction, and solid-state electrolytes of LSBs are emphasized. The challenges of both liquid and solid electrolytes at low temperatures are analyzed and the research directions for overcoming the challenges are also proposed in this paper for further research and development toward practical application.

However, lithium (Li) dendrites formation and polysulfide shuttle effect are two major challenges that limit the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Here we design a facile bifunctional interlayer of gelatin-based fibers (GFs), aiming to protect the Li anode surface from the dendrites growth and also hinder the polysulfide shuttle effect. We reveal that the 3D structural network of GFs layer with abundant polar sites helps to homogenize Li-ion flux, leading to uniform Li-ion deposition. Meanwhile, the polar moieties also immobilize the lithium polysulfides and protect the Li metal from the side-reaction. As a result, the anode protected batteries have shown significantly enhanced performance. A high coulombic efficiency of 96% after 160 cycles has been achieved in the Li-Cu half cells. The Li-Li symmetric cells exhibit a prolonged lifespan for 800 h with voltage hysteresis (10 mV). With the as-prepared GFs layer, the Li-S battery shows approximately 14% higher capacity retention than the pristine battery at 0.5 C after 100 cycles. Our work presents that this gelatin-based bi-functional interlayer provides a viable strategy for the manufacturing of advanced Li-S batteries.

The thickness-dependent interfacial properties, e.g., the specific surface area, porosity, and the oxygen doping level, have significantly improved mass/charge transfer and polysulfide chemisorption of U-PCNS. It is worth noting that the thickness of U-PCNS is vitally sensitive to the initial water concentration, which manipulates viscosity of hydrogels, hydrogen bonding between polymers, polymer assembly manner, and thus the thickness of as-prepared carbon nanosheets. The enhanced interfacial properties of U-PCNS endow lithium-sulfur cathodes with excellent rate capability at 0.2C, outstanding cycle life over 1000 cycles, and an area-specific capacity up to 4.02 mAh cm(-2).

However, the traditional cathode materials have poor cycle stability and low specific capacity, which fail to adsorb the lithium polysulfide and improve the electronic conductivity simultaneously. This work prepared mesoporous Co3O4 nanosheets, which could strongly anchoring lithium polysulfide, thus showing remarkable improvement for cycle stability. The SEM shows that the as-prepared MCON-S composites exhibit nanosheet structure. The MCON-S displays an initial specific capacity of 1316 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C.

The S/KB + PEDOT:PSS cathode displayed higher electrochemical performance than the S/KB cathode. The effectiveness of suppressing polysulfide dissolution was determined visually and by UV-visible spectroscopy.

To address these problems, we have designed and synthesized a ternary NbS2@S@IG composite consisting of sandwich-type NbS2@S enveloped by iodine-doped graphed (IG). The sandwich-type structure provides an interconnected conductive network and plane-to-point intimate contact between layered NbS2 (or IG) and sulfur particles, enabling sulfur species to be efficiently entrapped and utilized at ultrahigh rates, while the structural integrity is well maintained. NbS2@S@IG exhibits prominent high power charge/discharge performances. Reversible capacities of 195, 107, and 74 mA h g(-2) (1.05 mg cm(-2)) have been achieved after 2000 cycles at ultrahigh rates of 20, 30, and 40 C, respectively, and the corresponding average decay rates per cycle are 0.022%, 0.031% and 0.033%, respectively. When the area sulfur loading is increased to 3.25 mg cm(-2), the electrode still maintains a high discharge capacity of 405 mAh g(-2) after 600 cycles at 1 degrees C. Three half-cells in series assembled with NbS2@S@IG can drive 60 indicators of LED modules after only 18 s of charging. The instantaneous current and power of the device reach 196.9 A g(-1) and 1369.7 W g(-2), respectively.

The sulfur host materials play pivotal roles in the practical deployment. Herein, one type of new heterostructure nanosheets composed of cobalt boride (CoB) on nitrogen, boron-codoped porous carbon (NBC), which is constructed through molten salt-assisted strategy using ZIF-67-encapsulated ZIF-8 as precursors is reported on. Benefiting from strong interfacial electronic interactions between binary sulfiphilic CoB and porous NBC, the CoB/NBC-S electrode exhibits the excellent cycling stability with low average capacity decay of 0.013% in ultralong 1500 cycles at high rate of 5 C. Remarkably, the electrode with high sulfur content of 82 wt% and high sulfur loading of 5.8 mg cm(-2) delivers gravimetric capacity of 1309 mA h g(-1), areal capacity of 7.59 mA h cm(-2), and volumetric capacity of 1355 mA h cm(-3) at 0.1 C. The favorable electrochemical performance can rival with the state-of-the-art of those in the reported nanosheets-based sulfur cathodes. This study provides new methodology for the design of heterostructure nanosheets of metal borides to achieve energy density and longevity of Li-S batteries.

Resulting CDCs reveal uniform pore size and pore shape with a specific surface area of 2434 m(2) g(-1) and a total pore volume as high as 2.64 cm(3) g(-1). The bimodal CDC material is a highly attractive host structure for the active material in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cathodes. It facilitates the utilization of high molarity electrolytes and therefore the cells exhibit good rate performance and stability. The cathodes in the 5 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) electrolyte show the highest discharge capacities (up to 1404 mA h g(s)(-1)) and capacity retention (72% after 50 cycles at C/5). The unique network structure of the carbon host enables uniform distribution of sulfur through the conductive media and at the same time it facilitates rapid access for the electrolyte to the active material.

When used as a sulfur cathode material, the oxygen-deficient TiO2-x exhibits enhanced lithium polysulfides (LiPS) adsorption and conversion kinetics that effectively tackle the shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur batteries. The excellent ability of the oxygen vacancy sites on TiO2, surface to trap LiPS is proved by experimental observations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Meanwhile, it also promotes conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides, as verified by the asymmetric cell experiment. Accordingly, compared with the S/TiO2 cathode, the oxygen-deficient S/TiO2, electrode exhibits preeminent rate and cycling performance in lithium-sulfur batteries: it delivers an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.039 % per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1 C. Tunning the surface state of metal oxides by dealloying method offers a new facile strategy to design efficient sulfur cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this work, the dispersion for sulfur and restriction for lithium polysulfides have been combined to improve the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Sulfur is dispersed on acetylene black particles at first and then reduced carbon coating wraps acetylene black-sulfur particles. The reduced carbon coating is fabricated by deoxidizing carbon precursor which is the product of reaction between sucrose and concentrated sulfuric acid. Morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of materials have been characterized and tested. Results show that sulfur envelops acetylene black particles and is uniformly dispersed in acetylene black-sulfur composite. A layer of deoxidized carbon coating wraps acetylene black-sulfur particles. The carbon-sulfur composite with deoxidized carbon electrode exhibits higher specific capacity and cycle stability in comparison with acetylene black-sulfur composite electrode. Besides, the carbon-sulfur composite with deoxidized carbon electrode displays high coulombic efficiency, which is attributed to the restriction for dissolution of lithium polysulfides through the deoxidized carbon coating.

In this study, we employed a new sustainable microorganism-route to synthesize the fibroid fungus that could be used as the precursor to prepare sulfur host materials for lithium sulfur batteries. The H3PO4-activated fibroid fungus presents a controllable nano- and micro-structure after high temperature carbonization, which can effectively suppress polysulfides dissolution and supply space for sulfur accommodation due to its high specific surface area of 509 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 0.69 m(3) g(-1). As a result, the assembled lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery shows a high initial specific discharge capacity of 1319 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and maintains a capacity of 663 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles, corresponding to the outstanding reaction kinetics and cycling stability. Our results display an eco-friendly, renewable and controlled synthesis process of porous carbon, which features a promising application in preparing versatile electrodes in energy storage.

Their structure, morphology and specific surface area were characterized by X-ray diffraction, electron microanalysis and nitrogen adsorption analysis. The composites show morphology of nanosheets, high specific surface area and even distribution of sulfur. The sulfur accounts for 75% in the G/ MnO2/S composite by thermogravimetric analysis. The electrochemical performance of G/S and G/ MnO2/S cathode were investigated. The G/ MnO2/ S composite cathodes show excellent rate performance and cycle stability. At a 0.2C current density, initial discharge specific capacity is 1 061 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) and maintains 698 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) after 100 cycles; At a 1C current density, maximum discharge capacity reaches 816 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) and average capacity decreasing rate is only 0.073%/ cycle after running over 400 cycles. Electrochemical mechanism of the composites cathodes was analyzed. The sulfur adsorption of MnO2 inhibited the loss of active material sulfur, so, the electrochemical performance of the complex was improved.

However, reliable and controllable synthesis of single- to few-layered TiS2 nanosheets is challenging due to the strong tendency of stacking and oxidation of ultrathin TiS2 nanosheets. This study reports for the first time the successful conversion of Ti3C2Tx MXene to sandwich-like ultrathin TiS2 nanosheets confined by N, S co-doped porous carbon (TiS2@NSC) via an in situ polydopamine-assisted sulfuration process. When used as a sulfur host in lithium-sulfur batteries, TiS2@NSC shows both high trapping capability for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and remarkable electrocatalytic activity for LiPSs reduction and lithium sulfide oxidation. A freestanding sulfur cathode integrating TiS2@NSC with cotton-derived carbon fibers delivers a high areal capacity of 5.9 mAh cm(-2) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio and a high sulfur loading of 7.7 mg cm(-2), placing TiS2@NSC one of the best LiPSs adsorbents and sulfur conversion catalysts reported to date. The developed nanospace-confined strategy will shed light on the rational design and structural engineering of metal sulfides based nanoarchitectures for diverse applications.

J	Bertolini, S; Jacob, T				Bertolini, Samuel; Jacob, Timo			Sulfurized-polyacrylonitrile in lithium-sulfur batteries: Interactions between undercoordinated carbons and polymer structure under low lithiation	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Density functional theory; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Sulfurized-polyacrylonitrile	COMPOSITE CATHODE MATERIALS; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROLYTE; NANOTUBES; TEMPERATURE; STABILITY; SURFACES; BINDING	Lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) represents an important candidate to be used in energy storage applications, due to its high specific capacities. Sulfurized-polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is a candidate as a host material in LSB to replace graphite, due to its ability to chemisorb polysulfides (PSs). The sulfur chains attached to the polymer can reversibly form Li2S, and SPAN indicates to have a good cyclability and better performance than graphite, thus, SPAN acts partially as an active and also as a host material. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the solvent or the SPAN to lose a hydrogen atom from the backbone, to predict possible anodic reactions between solvent and host material. The simulation suggests that the photophilic salts may preferentially react with the solvent, and possibly building a cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). We observed that an undercoordinated carbon (C-uc) can be thermodynamically created, due to lithiation. The C-uc can react with the solvent on the polymer backbone through different mechanisms, however, the simulations indicated that the reaction should be affected by the interaction between the solvent and C-uc, according to SPAN's configuration. Moreover, C-uc reacts with long sulfur chains attached to SPAN, capturing sulfur and forming a C-S bond. A sulfur chain from one SPAN can connect to another polymer backbone, however, this process is affected by lithiation and vice-versa. Therefore, this work also investigates the formation of interconnected SPAN structures and the multiple C-uc effects.

Herein, we report cobalt-aluminum-layered double hydroxide quantum dots (LDH-QDs) deposited with nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) as a bifunctional separator for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). The mesoporous LDH-QDs/NG hybrids possess abundant active sites of Co2+ and hydroxide groups, which result in capturing LiPSs through strong chemical interactions and accelerating the redox kinetics of the conversion reaction, as confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adsorption tests, Li2S nucleation tests, and electrokinetic analyses of the LiPS conversion. The resulting LDH-QDs/NG hybrid-coated polypropylene (LDH-QDs/NG/PP) separator, with an average thickness of similar to 17 mu m, has a high ionic conductivity of 2.67 mS cm(-1). Consequently, the LSB cells with the LDH-QDs/NG/PP separator can deliver a high discharge capacity of 1227.48 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C along with a low capacity decay rate of 0.041% per cycle over 1200 cycles at 1.0C.

Herein, a systematical study with regard to both experimental and theoretical of N/S heteroatoms co-doped polar surface (denoted as NSHC) is conducted to demonstrate the significance of rational structure design as well as rapid sulfur related redox kinetics for high loading cathode. With prominent merits in both heteroatoms doping and hierarchical structure, the as-fabricated NSHC/S cathode guarantees extraordinary sulfur storage, which enables fast sulfur electrochemistry under the conditions of high sulfur loading (6.72 mg cm(-2)), high sulfur content (80 wt%) and lean electrolyte usage (electrolyte/sulfur ratio: 7.5 mu L mg(-1)). Of particular emphasis is the compact and high utilization of the host structure that ensures the assembled LSB with long and stable durability (606 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C and sulfur loading of 6.72 mg cm(-2)) and superior rate performance (689 mAh.g(-1) at 5.0 C and sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2)).

Their practical application, however, is hindered by the rapid capacity fading associated with the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) into organic electrolytes. In this work, we successfully impede these losses by anchoring thiol (-SH) functional groups to the nonpolar surface of a mesoporous carbon host. This new strategy increases the surface polarity of conductive carbons and traps LiPSs inside cathodes. By utilizing various spectroscopic methods, we investigate the mechanisms of LiPS trapping, which originate from the electrostatic and covalent interactions of the thiol functional groups with Li+ from the electrolyte and with S from the LiPS chains, respectively. Here, we for the first time identify the multiple interactions that are induced by a small molecular interface upon cycling and correlate them with the electrochemical behavior. The fundamental insight on the thiol functionality suggests a further rational design of multifunctional interfaces to achieve better Li-S performance.

Herein, free-standing graphene@carbon hollow sphere confining sulfur composite (G@C-HS@S) was prepared by ice template technology and vacuum immersion method for high-loading Li-S batteries. Ice template technology was used to adjust the vertical pore structure of the free-standing G@C-HS gel, allowing for easier ion transport. A three-dimensional G@C-HS framework with physical confinement improves the conductivity of cathode and inhibits the loss of sulfur and polysulfide, in which C-HS also greatly alleviates the volume expansion of sulfur. Sulfur is ingeniously encapsulated into G@C-HS framework by vacuum immersion method, achieving a high sulfur content of 81% and a high sulfur loading of 7.29 mg cm(-2). Benefiting from the above synergistic effects, G@C-HS@S delivers a specific capacity of 1187 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, a superior rate capability of 643 mAh g(-1) at 10 C, and an excellent cycle life of 61.8% after 700 cycles. The above results provide an effective route for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides and the poor electrical conductivity of sulfur cathodes significantly impedes the energy efficiency and cycle performance of this battery system. In this work, the anchoring behavior of polysulfides on a newly synthesized material named two-dimensional conjugated aromatic polymers (2D-CAP) was investigated using density functional theory calculations. The results show that the surface of 2D-CAP can provide moderate adsorption energies towards the soluble polysulfides, which can effectively avoid the dissolution of polysulfides into electrolyte while preserving their structural integrity. In the meantime, the small bandgap of 2D-CAP disappeared after lithium polysulfides adsorption and the nanoporous structure of 2D-CAP can facilitate lithium ion transportation, which can improve the cycling performance of Li-S batteries. Moreover, the 2D-CAP can effectively catalyze the decomposition process of Li2S. All of these properties suggest that 2D-CAP is a prospective anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries which not only mediate the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides but also promote the charge reaction of sulfur cathode.

Herein, we develop a new strategy to construct a Ketjen black@zeolite imidazole framework-8/polypropylene composite separator. Such a separator consists of Ketjen black (KB), zeolite imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) and polypropylene (PP) with a low coating load of 0.06 mg cm(-2) and is denoted as KB@ZIF-8/PP. KB@ZIF-8/PP can absorb polysulfides because of the Lewis acid-base interaction between ZIF-8 and polysulfides. This interaction can reduce the dissolution of polysulfides and suppress the shuttle effect, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of the battery. When tested at a current density of 0.1 C, an LSB with a KB@ZIF-8/PP separator exhibits low polarization and achieves a high initial capacity of 1235.6 mAh/g and a high capacity retention rate of 59.27% after 100 cycles.

However, its commercialization process is challenged by several issues, such as the non-conductive sulfur cathode material itself and the polysulfide shuttle effect, as well as sluggish redox reaction kinetics. Herein, we designed a threedimensional hierarchical structure of reduced graphene-tungsten oxide skeleton as a highly conductive and stable sulfur host material in Li-S battery. Based on various spectroscopic techniques, and In-situ electrochemical studies together with computational methods, it was confirmed that rGO@WO3 can catalyze the polysulfide conversion for improving Li-S battery performance. The constructed 3D rGO@WO3@S cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1410 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, excellent rate performance (715 mAh g(-1) at 3.0C), and a low capacity decay rate of 0.086% up to 500 cycles at 3.0C. This work provides a new pathway to explore the catalytic mechanism of tungsten oxide in promoting redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, we propose a composite carbon material with Co-N doping and high conductivity for polysulfides barrier layer. ZIF67 and high conductivity Ketjen Black(KB) are combined by a facile water solution reaction at room temperature at first, afterwords the as-prepared ZIF67/KB precursor is calcined in nitrogen atmosphere to obtain a novel Co-N/KB nano structure. The Co-N/KB hybrid is then coated on the commercial PE separator to improve electrochemical properties of Li-S battery. The Co-N/KB coating layer apparently promote the redox kinetics and show chemisorption ability toward polysulfides. Furthermore, the coating layer with high conductivity can also be used as a second current collector to promote the electronic transmission, which will increase the use ratio of active substances and improve the cycle retention. By the use of Co-N/KB modified separator, the initial discharge capacity of sulfur cathode with a sulfur areal loading of 3 mg cm(-2) reaches 888 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and shows a slow capacity decay rate of 0.025%/cycle after 200 cycles. Even when the areal loading of active sulfur is added up to 5 mg cm(-2), the battery can also show a stable cycle performance for more than 300 cycles. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, several challenges restrict the practical applications of LSBs. A major obstacle that limits its performance is the dissolution of long-chain lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte which results in loss of active material and capacity fade during the charge/discharge cycles. Here, we developed a novel sulfur composite with liquid-metal (LM) nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) dispensed on a carbon-cloth electrode to achieve long cycling of LSBs. The liquid nature of the LM nanoparticles results in many advantages. It provides a strong anchoring with sulfur inhibiting the polysulfide shuttle effect. In addition, it prevents the detachment of the sulfur particles from the current collector albeit large volume changes and cracking of the sulfur during lithiation and delithiation, maintaining the electron conduction paths. This innovative composite resulted in a high discharge capacity, an outstanding capacity retention, and a high Coulombic efficiency. Our results demonstrate an effective method to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect and pave a new path towards practical applications of LSBs by using multifunctional LM nanoparticles composites.

Composites comprising sulfur, acetylene black, and a Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4 solid electrolyte are fabricated by planetary ball milling using a temperature-controlled system. The composite electrode exhibits a high discharge capacity of greater than 1200 mAh g(-1) and a good cycle capability. As a result of high-temperature milling, composites are formed, incorporating novel structural units from the reaction between sulfur and the solid electrolyte, along with their intrinsic characteristics. Hence, high-temperature milling demonstrates promise for the fabrication of a composite electrode exhibiting high, reversible electrochemical activities for use in an all-solid-state lithium-sulfur battery.

These limitations can potentially be overcome using easy-to-infiltrate sulfur hosts with high catalytic materials. However, catalytic materials in such hosts are very susceptible to agglomeration due to the lack of efficient confinement in easy-to-infiltrate structures. Herein, using carbon dots as an aggregation limiting agent, the successful fabrication of self-supporting carbon nanofibers (CNF) containing Ni-single-atoms (Ni-SA) and uniformly dispersed Ni-nanoparticles (Ni-NP) of small sizes as multifunctional sulfur hosts is reported. The Ni-SA sites coordinated by such Ni-NP offer outstanding catalytic activity for sulfur reactions and CNF is an easy-to-infiltrate sulfur host with a large-scale preparation method. Accordingly, such hosts that can be prepared on a large scale enable sulfur cathodes to exhibit high sulfur utilization (66.5 mAh cm(-2) at approximate to 0.02 C) and cyclic stability (approximate to 86.1% capacity retention after 100 cycles at approximate to 0.12 C) whilst operating at a high sulfur loading (50 mg cm(-2)) and low E/S (5 mu L mg(-1)). This work provides a blueprint toward practical LSBs with high energy densities.

Here, to address these obstacles, a new sulfiphilic and highly conductive honeycomb-like spherical cathode host constructed from hollow metallic and polar Co9S8 tubes is designed. Co9S8 can effectively bind polar polysulfides for prolonged cycle life, due to the strong chemisorptive capability for immobilizing the polysulfide species. The hollow structure, as the sulfur host, can further prevent polysulfide dissolution and offer sufficient space to accommodate the necessary volume expansion. Well-aligned tubular arrays provide a conduit for rapid conduction of electrons and Li-ions. More importantly, the experimental results and theoretical calculations show that Co9S8 plays an important catalytic role in improving the electrochemical reaction kinetics. When used as cathode materials for Li-S batteries, the S@Co9S8 composite cathode exhibits high capacity and an exceptional stable cycling life demonstrated by tests of 600 cycles at 1 C with a very low capacity decay rate of only approximate to 0.026% per cycle.

SEM, EDX and TEM measurement were conducted. The result indicated that the AG/S had accordion structure with a uniform S coating on accordion structure AG. At the same time, sulfur was also found to be deposited on the interlayer of AG. Constant current charge-discharge tests showed that the AG/S complex cathode material with 65wt% sulfur delivered a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1452.9 mAh/g at the current density of 400 mA/g, with 909.7 mAh/g remained after 200 cycles. Meanwhile, an initial discharge specific capacity of 1309.9 mAh/g could be obtained for the material at the larger current density of 1000 mA/g, keeping 717.1 mAh/g after 200 cycles at the same current density. The rate performance, coulombic efficiency and cycling stability of the AG/S complex cathode materials were confirmed to be excellent, which may be originated from the homogeneous distribution of the sulfur with small powder size in the composites, the excellent electrical conductivity of AG and the fixation effect of the functional groups on the surface of AG for S.

We herein report a graphene oxide wrapped, multi-cavity, walnut-like carbon sphere (GO-MCWCS) cathode which may help to alleviate the above issue. The multi-cavity, walnut-like carbon spheres were obtained through a templated sol-gel process. Sulfur and polysulfides (the discharge intermediate at the cathode) are effectively immobilized in the GO-MCWCS cathode through a hierarchical mode of confinement, i.e. multiple levels of physical confinement by the abundant cavities of the walnut-like structure and the graphene oxide wrapping layer. The functional groups on GO (such as epoxy and hydroxyl groups) also help to retain polysulfides in the cathode via chemical binding. Attributed to the rational design of the GO-MCWCS cathode, our Li-S battery displayed an excellent cycle performance (85% capacity retention and nearly 100% coulombic efficiency after 200 cycles at 0.5C) and a good rate capability (905 mAh g(-1) and 680 mAh g(-1) at 1C and 2C, respectively). It is believed that the novel GO-MCWCS composite structure is a promising cathode design for advanced Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, a freestanding sulfur cathode based on nitrogen-doped porous carbon fiber/vertical graphene (NF@VG) composites is proposed. The porous structure and nitrogen doping effectively enhance absorption of polysulfides through physical confinement and chemical action, while vertical graphene network greatly promotes electron transfer and boosts the catalytic conversion kinetics of polysulfides. Therefore, the as-prepared sulfur cathode exhibits an initial capacity of 738 mA h g(-1), and a maintained capacity of 609 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles with only 0.029% capacity fading per cycle at 1C rate at a sulfur loading of 7 mg cm(-2). In addition, the battery displays an areal capacity of 12.8 mA h cm(-2) under high sulfur loading (13 mg cm(-2)), high sulfur content (81.6 wt%), and low E/S (4.8 mu L mg(-1)), indicating that NF@VG composite fibers are highly competitive as a sulfur host for Li-S batteries.

Herein, 2D amorphous Mo-doped cobalt boride (Co7Mo3B) is designed for the first time as bidirectional sulfur catalysis by rapid chemical reduction. The atom cluster structure of Co7Mo3B is revealed by theoretical calculation. Electron paramagnetic resonance test further confirms that Co7Mo3B has interstitial compound structure characteristics. Experimental results show that the porous 2D nanosheets structure and the interaction of Mo, B, Co atoms contribute to enhanced conductivity, high long-chain lithium polysulfides affinity, and reversible Li2S nucleation and dissociation, thus accelerating LiPSs reduction and Li2S oxidation kinetics. In addition, the interstitial Co7Mo3B enables intercalation of Li and B during charging-discharging while keeping the structure stable. As a result, the S cathode with Co7Mo3B catalyst delivers good life (1000 cycles at 5 C), superior rate performance (10 C). Even at high sulfur areal loading of 6.79 mg cm(-2) and electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 mu L mg(-1), the Co7Mo3B/S composite cathode still exhibits good areal capacity and capacity retention rate.

Heterostructure can effectively adsorb polysulfides, which takes advantage of the ferroelectric effect of perovskite. After the in situ exsolution of Co nanometals, the exsolution of conductive metals enhance the conductivity of the heterostructure, while the in situ exsolved Co nanometal has excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability. Because of the superior interface compatibility between the in situ exsolved Co nanometal and pemvskite, promote the synergy of adsorption-catalysis performance. The STO@Co electrode delivers higher specific capacity, better long-cycle stability, and rate capability compared to metal-impregnated perovskite heterostructure (STO/Co).

POF-HS exhibits explicit chemical structures of 2D POF and an expected hollow structure. The morphology of POF-HS is further regulated in terms of void size and shell thickness. Benefited from the polar chemical structures and the hollow spherical morphology, POF-HS sufficiently mitigates the shuttle of polysulfides by taking the dual effects of chemical adsorption and physical confinement and functions as a desirable host material for sulfur cathode to endow lithium-sulfur batteries with high capacity, long cycling life, and excellent rate performance. The accurate synthesis of POF-HSs demonstrates the highly controllable and versatile morphology of organic framework materials beyond precise integration of organic building blocks and represents infinite possibility of offering exotic organic frameworks for chemistry, sustainable energy, and material science.

Herein, we develop a facile "in-situ growth" method to decorate ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles (US-Mo2C) on the surface of Ketjen Black (KB) to functionalize the commercial polypropylene (PP) separators, which can accelerate the redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides conversion and effectively increase the utilization of sulfur for Li-S batteries. Importantly, the US-Mo2C nanoparticles have abundant sites for chemical adsorption towards polysulfides and the conductive carbon networks of KB have cross-linked pore channels, which can promote electron transport and provide physical barrier and volume expansion space for polysulfides. Due to the combined effects of the US-Mo2C and KB, Li-S cells employing the multifunctional PP separators modified with KB/US-Mo2C composite (KB/US-Mo2C@PP) exhibit a high specific capacity (1212.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), and maintain a reversible capacity of 1053.3 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. More importantly, the KB/US-Mo2C@PP cells with higher sulfur mass loading of 4.9 mg cm(-2) have superb areal capacity of 2.3 mAh cm(-2). This work offers a novel and promising perspective for high-performance Li-S batteries from both the shuttle effect and the complex polysulfides conversion.

When applied as a host material in lithium-sulfur batteries, porous silica materials with a pomegranate-like architecture can not only act as a buffer matrix for accommodating a large volume change of sulfur, but also suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect. The porous silica/sulfur composite cathodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performances including a high specific capacity of 1450mAhg(-1), a reversible capacity of 82.9% after 100cycles at a rate of C/2 (1C=1672mAg(-1)) and an extended cyclability over 300cycles at 1 C-rate. Furthermore, the high polysulfide adsorption property of porous silica has been proven by ex-situ analyses, showing a relationship between the surface area of silica and polysulfide adsorption ability. In particular, the modified porous silica/sulfur composite cathode, which is treated by a deep-lithiation process in the first discharge step, exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 94.5% at 1C-rate after 300cycles owing to a formation of lithiated-silica frames and stable solid-electrolyte-interphase layers.

Nanocubic cobalt phosphide/carbon (CoP/C) was modified on PP membrane through a simple vacuum filtration method. This CoP/C-modified PP separator not only efficiently captures polysulfides through strong chemical affinity but also facilitates the conversion of the soluble intermediates due to the fast transfer at the interface. In consequence, the cell with a CoP/C-modified separator exhibits a low-capacity decay of only 0.08% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C with an initial capacity of 938 mAh g(-1) and a superior rate performance of 594 mAh g(-1) at 4 C. Even with a high loading of 3.2 mg cm(-2), the cell still exhibits an excellent reversible capacity of 601.3 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides a new strategy to effectively restrict the polysulfide shuttling.

Highly conductive and catalytically active sulfur host is still a research hotspot in recent years. Herein, the sulfur host of Co nanoparticles anchored on the Co-N-x active centers grafted nitrogen-doped graphene (Co/Co-N-x@NG) with high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity was prepared via a simple and feasible in situ method. The cobalt-based nanocatalytic center exhibits efficient sulfur conversion efficiency. Moreover, the Co-N-x coordination group is beneficial to inhibit the agglomeration of cobalt nanoparticles to form large particles and further improve the catalytic activity. In addition, the graphene structure formed at low temperature based on the two-dimensional guide of dicyandiamide in combination with the catalytic graphitization of cobalt nanoparticles has excellent electrical conductivity. Owing to the high catalytic activity, appropriate adsorption ability, and excellent electrical conductivity, the Co/Co-N-x@NG applied as sulfur cathode matrix exhibits high capacities of 1300.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and 884.2 mA h g(-1) at 2 C, and good cycling stability with a capacity decay of only 0.069% per cycle at 2 C for 705 cycles.

Yet their practical applications are still hindered by short cycle life, low efficiency and poor conductivity which are mainly caused by the insulating nature of sulfur and dissolution of polysulfides. Here, a nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets/sulfur (NGNSs/S) composite was synthesized via a facile chemical reaction deposition. In this composite, NGNSs was employed as a conductive host to entrap S/polysulfides in the cathode part. The NGNSs/S composite delivered an initial discharge capacity of 856.7 mAhg(-1) and a reversible capacity of 319.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C with good recoverable rate capability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In order to confine the LiPSs in the cathode area, Y2O3 nanoparticles-Ketjen Black (KB) hybrid prepared by wet impregnation followed by freeze drying and heat treatment was used as the main coating material of the separator in LSB. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images showed that the Y2O3 nanoparticles are approximately 5 nm and distributed uniformly in the KB matrix. The Y2O3-KB hybrid was coated on the surface of the common separator, working as a physical shield to restrain the shuttle phenomenon of LiPSs and an upper current collector to promote the charge transportation. LSB using this modified separator displays an initial discharge capacity of 1054 mAh g(-1) at 1 C (1675 mA g(-1)) and remains 816 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. Moreover, the discharge capacity of Y2O3-KB-modified separator sample reaches 846 mAh g(-1) at 2 C in the rate test which suggests an excellent rate capability. Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the Y2O3-KB-modified separator sample owns low charge transfer resistance, indicating a fast electrochemical kinetics, which is also proved by the cyclic voltammogram (CV) results.

Conventional lithium-sulfur batteries lack sufficient flexibility because their electrode materials are too rigid to bend. Along with the inherent high theoretical capacity of sulfur, lithium-sulfur batteries have some issues, such as dissolution and shuttle effect of polysulfides, which restricts their efficiency and practicability. Here, a flexible and "dead-weight"-free lithium-sulfur battery substrate with a three-dimensional structure was prepared by a simple strategy. With the cooperative assistance of carbon nanotubes and graphene attached to cotton fibers, the lithium-sulfur battery with 2.0 mg cm(-2) sulfur provided a high initial discharge capacity of 1098.7 mA h g(-1) at 1C, and the decay rate after 300 cycles was only 0.046% per cycle. The initial discharge capacity at 2C was 872.4 mA h g(-1) and the capacity was maintained 734.4 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles with only a 0.079% per cycle decay rate.

To overcome these challenges, we report a versatile route to prepare multi-functional nanocomposites with tuable hierarchical structure via ammonium hydroxide (NH3 center dot H2O) induced self-assembly. The versatility of the system has been demonstrated that the organization of the hierarchical structure can be regulated by adding different amounts of NH3 center dot H2O, and WS2 and Co9S8 with nitrogen-doped carbon coating (denoted as WS2@NC and Co9S8@NC) can be prepared by adding different precursor salts. When the as-prepared materials are applied for Li-S batteries, the WS2@NC composite exhibits a reversible capacity of 1107.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C after 500 cycles and even 728.9 mAh g(-1) at 2C for 1000 cycles, which is significantly better than the Co9S8 counterpart and other reported WS2 sulfur hosts. Experimentally, the advantageous performance of WS2 could be attributed to its higher surface area and total pore volume, giving rise to the easier access to electrolyte and better ability to buffer the volume change during the charge/discharge process. Theoretically, the density function theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the as-prepared WS2 has a higher binding energy towards LiPSs as well as a lower energy barrier for Li+ diffusion on the surface than Co9S8. More significantly, the density of states (DOS) analysis further confirms that the superior performance is mainly ascribed to the more prominent shifting and the more charge compensation from d band of W than Co, which increase electronic concentration and give more hybridization of d-p orbitals in the Fermi level of the adsorbed Li2S4 to accelerate the lithium polysulfide interfacial redox and conversion dynamics in WS2. By proposing this mechanism, this work sheds new light on the understanding of catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides at the atomic level and the strategy to develop advanced cathode materials for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we construct an Fe-NC material with uniform and stable Fe-N-2 coordination structure. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that the unsaturated Fe-N-2 center can act as a multifunctional site for anchoring lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), accelerating the redox conversion of LiPSs and reducing the reaction energy barrier of Li2S decomposition. Consequently, the batteries based on a porous carbon nitride supported Fe-N-2 site (Fe-N-2/CN) host exhibit excellent cycling performance with a capacity decay of 0.011% per cycle at 2 C after 2000 cycles. This work deepens the understanding of the relationship between electronic structure of M-NC sites and the catalysis effect for the conversion of LiPSs. This strategy also provides a potent guidance for the further application of M-NC materials in advanced lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, low sulfur utilization and sharp decay of Coulombic efficiency caused by the "shuttle effect" are still gaps that cannot be filled in the long-term development of Li-S batteries. To break through these bottlenecks, we report a ferromagnetic one-dimensional porous Fe3O4@C (1D-Fe3O4@C) electrode as a sulfur host. Benefitting from its one-dimensional (1D) structure, coated carbon shell, and excellent magnetic properties, the as-prepared electrode, besides enhanced conductivity, has a strong binding effect on polysulfides through the Lorentz force and physical adsorption, thereby reducing the "shuttle effect". At the same time, the porous morphology is conducive to sulfur loading and accommodates the huge volume changes during cycling. The 1D-Fe3O4@C/S electrode shows excellent specific capacity and superior high-rate cyclability, which is demonstrated by capacity retention rates of 95.1 and 92.7% for 200 cycles at 1 and 2 C, respectively.

Pistachio shell was the by-product from the agri-food industry chosen to obtain activated carbon with excellent textural properties, which acts as a conductive matrix for sulfur. Pistachio shell-derived carbon activated with phosphoric acid exhibits a high surface area (1345 m(2).g(-1)) and pore volume (0.67 cm(3).g(-1)), together with an interconnected system of micropores and mesopores that is capable of accommodating significant amounts of S and enhancing the charge carrier mobility of the electrochemical reaction. Moreover, preparation of the S composite was carried out by simple wet grinding of the components, eliminating the usual stage of S melting. The cell performance was very satisfactory, both in long-term cycling measurements and in rate capability tests. After the initial cycles required for cell stabilization, it maintained good capacity retention for the 300 cycles measured (the capacity loss was barely 0.85 mAh.g(-1) per cycle). In the rate capability test, the capacity released was around 650 mAh.g(-1) at 1C, a higher value than that supplied by other activated carbons from nut wastes.

For an efficient use of these new battery chemistries, careful selection of suitable electrode materials/structures is critical. Graphene, a unique two-dimensional nanomaterial, with its superior electronic conductivity, mechanical strength, and flexibility has been successfully applied in battery studies. Graphene, even with imperfect layers, will be of great interest to battery industrial applications if the manufacturing cost is reduced. Herein, we demonstrate the application of low-cost graphene sponge/sheets derived from expandable graphite in both lithium sulfur and hybrid lithium air batteries, respectively, as a cathode conductive matrix to accommodate the soluble poly- sulfides and as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction. High utilization of active materials and good cycling stability are realized in lithium sulfur and hybrid lithium air batteries by employing this low-cost material, demonstrating its promise for use in next-generation battery chemistries.

However, the difficulty in fabrication restricts their application. In this work, a facile method to fabricate nitrogen and phosphorus co -doped multi-scaled porous carbon is reported. The porous carbon (named as CPANiP-NaCI) with highly interconnected network structure was fabricated by pyrolysis of phytic acid cross-linked polyaniline aerogels with the assistance of sodium chloride (NaCI). NaCI served as a hard template before melting, which helps to keep the interconnected framework of precursor and prevent the generated carbon intermediates stacking into bulks. Molten NaCI provides an inner media to facilitate dissolved oxysalt (PO4-) to partially oxidize the carbon intermediates and generate micro -pores. Improved specific surface area and porous volume promote the impregnation of sulfur and electrolyte, and the high conductivity of CPANiP-NaCI enhances the electron transportation. Besides that, physical absorption of micro-pores and chemical anchoring of doped heteroatoms accelerate the transformation of polysulfide species. The simultaneously enhanced confinement to polysulfide species with different polarities helps realize the superior cyclic stability and rate performance of CPANiP-NaCl/Sulfur. Finally, the cells maintain the capability of 652 mAh"g-1 (1 C = 1675 mAh"g-1) at 0.5 C and 94% capacity retention after 120 cycles. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Moon, S; Jung, YH; Kim, DK				Moon, San; Jung, Young Hwa; Kim, Do Kyung			Enhanced electrochemical performance of a crosslinked polyaniline-coated graphene oxide-sulfur composite for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Sulfur; Battery; Conductive polymer; Crosslinking	CATHODE; CARBON; ELECTRODE; FABRICATION; CAPSULES; DENSITY	Due to the extraordinarily high theoretical capacity of sulfur (1675 mAh g(-1)), the lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery has been considered a promising candidate for future high-energy battery applications. Li-S batteries, however, have suffered from limited cycle lives, mainly due to the formation of soluble polysulfides, which prevent the practical application of this attractive technology. The encapsulation of sulfur with various conductive materials has addressed this issue to some extent. Nevertheless, most approaches still present partial encapsulation of sulfur and moreover require a large quantity of conductive material (typically, >30 wt%), making the use of sulfur less desirable from the viewpoint of capacity. Here, we address these chronic issues of Li-S cells by developing a graphene oxide-sulfur composite with a thin crosslinked polyaniline (PANI) layer. Graphene oxide nanosheets with large surface area, high conductivity and a uniform conductive PANI layer, which are synthesized by a layer-by-layer method, have a synergetic interaction with a large portion of the sulfur in the active material. Furthermore, a simple crosslinking process efficiently prevents polysulfide dissolution, resulting in unprecedented electrochemical performance, even with a high sulfur content (similar to 75%): a high capacity retention of similar to 80% is observed, in addition to 97.53% of the average Coulombic efficiency being retained after 500 cycles. The performance we demonstrate represents an advance in the field of lithium sulfur batteries for applications such as power tools. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, a free-standing cellulose nanofiber (CNF) separator is designed and fabricated in isopropanol/water suspension through vacuum filtration progress. CNFs with abundant polar oxygen-containing functional groups can chemically immobilize the polysulfides, and suppress the formation of the dendrites by controlling the surface morphology of the SEI on lithium metal in LSB. The isopropanol content in a suspension can fine-tune the pore structure of the membrane to achieve optimal electrochemical performance. The prepared separator displays integrated advantages of an ultra thin thickness (19 mu m), lightweight (0.87 mg cm(-2)), extremely high porosity (98.05%), and decent electrolyte affinity. As a result, the discharge capacity of the LSB with CNF separator at the first and 100th cycle is 1.4 and 1.3 times that of PP separator, respectively. Our research provides an environmental friendly and facile strategy for the preparation of multifunctional separators for LSBs.

Despite innovations in concepts and materials that significantly improve the electrochemical performance of coin cells, Li-S pouch cells have the disadvantages of short cycle life and inferior rate capability in comparison with coin cells. Bridging the fundamentals of Li-S chemistry to the hindrance on its practical application is of great importance for the development of Li-S batteries. Herein, the nonuniformity of the distribution of sulfur and lithium upon cycling is probed as one of the origins for the rapid capacity fading in a Li-S pouch cell. In particular, the nonuniform evolution of sulfur/lithium distribution impairs the discharge capacity of a low-voltage plateau. Lithium polysulfide intermediates produced on discharge tend to diffuse toward the bottom of a pouch cell, leading to agglomeration of sulfur and thus passivating the cathode. The migration of polysulfides also etches lithium away from the central region of the anode and induces nonuniform anode pulverization. Herein, the importance of a rational design of a pouch cell to mitigate the nonuniform redistribution of the active material toward stable Li-S pouch cells is highlighted.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as a promising option because of their high theoretical capacity and energy density. Here, cable-shaped Li-S batteries are developed based on a nitrogen-doped carbon/carbon nanotube/sulfur (NCNT/S) composite cathode and lithium metal anode. The carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns with high conductivity and an appropriate amount of doped nitrogen are synthesized by wet-spinning followed by a carbonization process, and further act as a self-supported conductive backbone for the active material. The NCNT/S yarns exhibit a high initial capacitance of 1001 mAh g(-1) and excellent cyclic stability with 87% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. Furthermore, the assembled cable-shaped Li-S batteries by NCNT/S yarns present good ability to light up the LEDs for more than 8 h under normal and bending states at various angles, indicating that the cable-shaped Li-S batteries could be a prospective candidate for application in wearable electronics.

However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur, infamous polysulfides shuttle and slow redox kinetics result in fast capacity fade and poor rate capabilities. To solve these barriers, herein a modification strategy of functional separator is presented by coating transition metal coordinated graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with crystalline carbons (M-C3N4/C) on the surface of a commercial separator. The coating layer exhibits both satisfactory interception ability for polysulfides shuttle and fast polysulfides conversion ability. It has been found that the uniformly distributed transition metal on g-C3N4/C acts as an active center to regulate polysulfides behavior via strong chemisorption capability and high catalytic activity towards polysulfide conversion, while the transition metal-interface guarantees the rapid electron transfer, which can consequently facilitate the utilization of active sulfur species. Notably, after considerable assessments from density functional theory calculations, spectroscopy and electrochemical performances, it can be concluded that the Ni-C3N4/C can strongly bind polysulfides and expedite polysulfides conversion kinetics as well as promote electrons/ion transfer. As a result, the lithium-sulfur batteries with Ni-C3N4/C-modified separator can deliver 999 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) with high capacity retention of 89.4% after 300 cycles. Even at a great sulfur loading of 4.6 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6 mu L mg(-1), a large initial capacity of 724.6 mAh g(-1) is still obtained at 1.0 A g(-1). The separator reported in this work initiates the exploration of transition metals coordination as dynamic regulators of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries and also reveals an understanding of the catalytic reactions.

Here, we establish a facile route to three-dimensional hierarchical porous structures based on the dopamine surface-functionalization of silica nanoparticles. This strategy enables in situ transformation of molybdenum dioxide particles into building blocks owing to the ability of dopamine coordinated with molybdate ions. Through aperture analysis and electrochemical measurements, these hosts manifest their respective superiority in sulfur fixation By contrast, the hierarchical porous structure with inner pores of 50 nm and interlocking pores exhibits a superior comprehensive performance than the other samples. Our work also proposes a universal and highly controllable strategy in constructing more powerful porous structures for LSBs or other applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The sulfur contents in the SGC, determined by thermogravimetry and elementary analysis, have been adjusted in the range from 20.9 to 72.5 wt.%. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images reveal that most of the sulfur is uniformly dispersed on the reduced graphene oxide sheets, for which no sulfur in particulate form could be observed. The SGC materials have been tested as the cathode of rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, and demonstrated a high reversible capacity and good cycleability. The SGC-63.6%S can deliver a reversible capacity as high as 804 mA center dot h/g after 80 cycles of charge/discharge at a current density of 312 mA/g (ca. 0.186 C), and 440 mA center dot h/g after 500 cycles at 1250 mA/g (ca. 0.75 C).

Recently, addition of the polysulfide adsorbents within sulfur cathode is effectively improving the electrochemical performance. Herein, TiO(2)integrated with g-C3N4(TiO2@g-C3N4: TOCN) hybrid was prepared by a facile heating treatment from the precursor of urea and TiO(2)composites, which used as host material for elemental sulfur (TOCN@S) in Li-S batteries. The multifunctional TOCN not only reduced the electrochemical resistance but also provided strong adsorption sites to immobilize sulfur and polysulfide. As a result, the TOCN@S cathode with a sulfur content of 74.5 wt% and a sulfur loading of 3.1 mg cm(-2)exhibits a high initial capability of 804 mAh g(-1)at 0.5 degrees C with capacity retention of 67.2% after 500 cycles. Additionally, the composite cathode also possesses excellent high-rate performance, retaining a remarkable specific capacity of 630 mAh g(-1)even at a rate of 2 degrees C.

The effects of activation time on the microstructure and electrochemical properties were investigated. The direct pyrolysis product inherited the tube-like morphology. After activated by KOH under high temperature once, the microtubes were shorten and pressed as ribbon-like. Meanwhile abundant micropores were formed in the tube wall. Further activatated the product twice, the original tube-like microstructure was collapsed. Thus the results demonstrated that extending the activation time greatly affected the microstructure of carbon product. Furthermore, the sample activated once exhibited the largest specific surface area of 2033.09 m(2) g(-1)and the largest sulfur loading ratio (71.1 %). Moreover, the suitable activated sample exhibited the highest specific discharge capacity (1365.8 mAh g(-1)) and the best cycling performance. Consequently, the activation process played an important role in the microstructure and electrochemical performance of catkin derived carbon matrix in Li-S battery.

Significant research currently focuses on increasing the sulfur loading and sulfur/inactive-materials ratio, to improve life and capacity. Inspired by nature's ant-nest structure, this research results in a novel Li-S electrode that is designed to meet both goals. With only three simple manufacturing friendly steps, which include slurry :ball-milling, doctor-blade based laminate casting, and the use of the sacrificial method with water to dissolve away table salt, the ant-nest design has been successfully recreated in an Li-S electrode. The efficient capabilities of the ant-nest structure are adopted to facilitate fast ion transportation, sustain polysulfide dissolution, and assist efficient precipitation. High cycling stability in the Li-S batteries, for practical applications, has been achieved with up to 3 mg.cm(-2) sulfur loading.

But the commercial application of LSB is still impeded by the fast capacity decay resulted from the polysulfide shuttle, which is one of the primary factors responsible for the degradation of capacity. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to trap polysulfide within the space between cathode and separator: a composite separator consists of lithiated polystyrolsulfon acid (Li-PSSA) and alginic acid (AA) are used to modify the surfaces of both cathode and separator based on electrostatic shield effect. By this specially design, the negatively charged SO3- groups on Li-PSSA function as an electrostatic barrier for soluble polysulfide through coulombic repulsion, whereas the Li+ groups on Li-PSSA can provide the necessary paths for lithium ions to transmit within LSB. The selective shielding effect shows an effective suppression for the shuttle effect of polysulfide by confining them within the cathode side. This strategy has greatly improved the cyclic stability of LSB, presenting an ultralow capacity decay of 0.141% per cycle after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, far superior to that of the battery without any modification. Therefore, this simple strategy could be an alternative approach for LSB application.

Herein, different from the conventional mechanical mixing methods, we present an effective molten-salt protocol for loading ferroelectrics into the hierarchical porous carbon matrix as the host for the sulfur cathode. As the proof of concept, prototype BaTiO3 is used as the ferroelectric additive. Interestingly, the rationally-fabricated composite structure ensures homogeneous distribution of ferroelectric particles within the carbon framework through the liquid medium and effectively avoids aggregation of ferroelectrics that was always seen in traditional compositing methods. Profiting from the electrochemically active merits including uniform dispersion of ferroelectrics, activated carbonaceous porous structure, enhanced crystallinity of BaTiO3, and high-strength component interactions that were introduced by the molten-salt strategy, the as-prepared cathode presented excellent rate capabilities and outstanding cycling stability. This work marks a step ahead towards the fabrication of high-performance ferroelectric based composites for advanced energy conversion and storage use.

In this research, we utilize tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) as multifunctional catalyst for high-performance Li-S batteries through optimizing electrolyte chemistry for the first time. With TTF additive in electrolyte, it acts as p-electron donor molecule to improve the electron transport of Li2Sx due to the van der Waals interaction, and promote LiNO3 to Li3N to form highly conductive passivation layer on lithium anode (Li-anode). Furthermore, TTF functions as a catalyst to improve the redox kinetics of Li2Sx thus slowing down the "shuttle effect", improve the utilization of sulfur, and protect the Li-anode. As a result, the cell with TTF exhibits excellent performances with high discharge capacity (1359 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C), long-term cycling stability (509 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C), and excellent cycling performance even at low E/S ratio (5.5 mu L mg(-1)) (initial discharge capacity of 1129 mAh g(-1) with a capacity decay rate of 0.20% per cycle at 0.1C for 200 cycles).

Sulfur particles with a size of a few microns are successfully grown in the interior spaces between randomly dispersed graphene sheets through a heterogeneous crystal growth mechanism. The proposed route not only enables the control of the particle size of active sulfur but also affords quantitative yields of composite powder in large quantities. We investigate the potential use of the sulfur-impregnated graphene composite as a cathode material owing to its advantages of confining active sulfur, preventing the dissolution of soluble polysulfides, and providing sufficient electrical conduction. A high discharge capacity of 1237 mA h g(-1) during the first cycle and a good cyclic retention of 67% after 50 cycles are attained in a voltage range of 1.8-2.6 V vs. Li/Li+. These results emphasize the importance of tailoring cathode materials for improving the electrochemical properties of lithium-sulfur batteries. Our results provide a basis for further investigations on advanced lithium batteries.

This paper reports a thermal exfoliation of metal-organic framework crystals with intrinsic 2D structure into multilayer graphene stacks. This family of nanocarbon stacks is composed of well-preserved 2D sheets with highly accessible interlayer macropores, narrowly distributed 7 angstrom micropores, and ever most polar pore walls. The surface polarity is quantified both by its ultrahigh water vapor uptake of 14.3 mmol g(-1) at low relative pressure of P/P-0 = 0.4 and ultrafast water wetting capability in less than 10.0 s. Based on the structural merits, this series hydrophilic multilayer graphene stack is showcased as suitable model cathode host for unveiling the challenging surface chemistry issue in Li-S batteries.

Here, a multifunctional Ag/VN@Co/NCNT nanocomposite with multiple adsorption and catalytic sites within hierarchical nano-reactors is reported as a robust sulfur host for LSB cathodes. In this hierarchical nanoreactor, heterostructured Ag/VN nano-rods serve as a highly conductive backbone structure and provide internal catalytic and adsorption sites for LiPS conversion. Interconnected nitrogen-doped carbon nano-tubes (NCNTs), in situ grown from the Ag/VN surface, greatly improve the overall specific surface area for sulfur dispersion and accommodate volume changes in the reaction process. Owing to their high LiPS adsorption ability, outer Co nanoparticles at the top of the NCNTs catch escaped LiPS, thus effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and enhancing kinetics. Benefiting from the multiple adsorption and catalytic sites of the developed hierarchical nanoreactors, Ag/VN@Co/NCNTs@S cathodes display outstanding electrochemical performances, including a superior rate performance of 609.7 mAh g(-1) at 4 C and a good stability with a capacity decay of 0.018% per cycle after 2000 cycles at 2 C. These properties demonstrate the exceptional potential of Ag/VN@Co/NCNTs@S nanocomposites and approach LSBs closer to their real-world application.

J	Chen, Y; Lu, ST; Wu, XH; Liu, J				Chen, Yan; Lu, Songtao; Wu, Xiaohong; Liu, Jie			Flexible Carbon Nanotube-Graphene/Sulfur Composite Film: Free-Standing Cathode for High-Performance Lithium/Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							SULFUR NANOCRYSTALS; ENCAPSULATED SULFUR; POROUS CARBON; OXIDE; PAPER; ELECTRODE; PARTICLES; CAPACITY; HYBRID; ANODE	Flexible lithium batteries with high,energy density have recently received tremendous interest due to their potential applications in flexible electronic devices. Herein, we report a novel method to fabricate highly flexible S), composite film as free-standing cathode for flexible Li/S and robust carbon nanotube-graphene/sulfur (CNT.s-RGO/ batteries with increased capacity and significantly improved rate capability. The free-standing CNTs-RGO/S cathode was able to deliver a peak capacity of 911.5 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) (similar to 483 mAh g(electrode)(-1)) and maintain 771.8 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) after 100 charge-discharge cycles at 0,2, indicating a capacity retention of 84.7%, which were both higher than the cathodes assembled without CNTs. Even after 100 cycles, the cathode showed a high tensile strength of 623 MPa. More importantly, the rate capability was improved by introducing CNTs. The CNTs-RGO/S cathode exhibited impressive capacities of 613.1 rnAh g(sulfur)(-1) at 1C with a capacity recuperability of similar to 94% as the current returned to 0.2C. These results demonstrate that the well nanocomposites are of great potential as the cathode for flexible lithium sulfur (Li/S) batteries. Such improved electrochemical properties could be atttibuted to the unique coaxial architecture of the nanocomposite, in which the evenly dispersed CNTs enable electrodes with improved electrical conductivity and mechanical properties and better ability to avoid the aggregation and ensure the dispersive distribution of the sulfur species during the charge/discharge process.

The full demonstration of the high-energy-density electrodes is a key issue towards full utilization of sulfur in a lithium-sulfur cell. Herein, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that possess robust mechanical properties, excellent electrical conductivities, and hierarchical porous structures were employed to fabricate carbon/sulfur composite cathode. A family of electrodes with areal sulfur loading densities ranging from 0.32 to 4.77 mg cm(-2) were fabricated to reveal the relationship between sulfur loading density and their electrochemical behavior. At a low sulfur loading amount of 0.32 mg cm(-2), a high sulfur utilization of 77% can be achieved for the initial discharge capacity of 1288 mAh g(s)(-1), while the specific capacity based on the whole electrode was quite low as 84 mAh g(C/S+binder+Al)(-1) at 0.2 C. Moderate increase in the areal sulfur loading to 2.02 mg cm(-2) greatly improved the initial discharge capacity based on the whole electrode (280 mAh g(C/S+binder+Al)(-1)) without the sacrifice of sulfur utilization. When sulfur loading amount further increased to 3.77 mg cm(-2), a high initial areal discharge capacity of 3.21 mAh cm(-2) (864 mAh g(s)(-1)) was achieved on the composite cathode.

Furthermore, surface chemistry at soluble polysulfides/electrolyte interface is a crucial step for Li-S battery in which stable cycling depends on adsorption and reutilization of blocked polysulfides in the electrolyte. A multifunctional catalytic interface composed of niobium nitride/N-doped graphene (NbN/NG) along the soluble polysulfides/electrolyte is designed and constructed to regulate corresponding interface chemical reaction, which can afford long-range electron transfer surfaces, numerous strong chemisorption, and catalytic sites in a working lithium-sulfur battery. Both experimental and theoretical calculation results suggest that a new catalytic interface enabled by metal-like NbN with superb electrocatalysis anchored on NG is highly effective in regulating the blocked polysulfide redox reaction and tailoring the Li2S nucleation-growth-decomposition process. Therefore, the Li-S batteries with multifunctional NbN/NG barrier exhibit excellent rate performance (621.2 mAh g(-1) at 3 C) and high stable cycling life (81.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles). This work provides new insights to promote Li-S batteries via multifunctional catalytic interface engineering.

During the past decade, great progress has been achieved in promoting the performances of Li-S batteries by addressing the challenges at the laboratory-level model systems. With growing attention paid to the application of Li-S batteries, new challenges at practical cell scales emerge as the bottleneck. In this Outlook, the key parameters for practical Li-S batteries to achieve practical high energy density are emphasized regarding high-sulfur-loading cathodes, lean electrolytes, and limited excess anodes. Subsequently, the key scientific problems are redefined in practical Li-S batteries beyond the previous ones under ideal conditions. Finally, viable strategies are proposed to address the above challenges as future research directions.

However, it has been challenged to achieving practical application of sulfur cathode because of low loading of active sulfur and poor cycle performance. Herein, we design novel nanocomposite cathode materials consist of sulfur (80 wt%) embedded within nitrogen doped three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (N-3D-rGO) by controllable sulfur-impregnation method. Nitrogen doping helps increase the surface area by ten times from pristine graphene, and pore volume by seven times. These structural features allow the cathode to hold more sulfur. It also adsorbs polysulfides and prevents their detachment from the host materials; thereby achieving stable cycle performance. The solution drop sulfur-impregnation method provides uniform distribution of nano-sulfur in controlled manner. The material delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1042 mAhg(-1) and 916 mAhg(-1) with excellent capacity retention of 94.8% and 81.9% at 0.2 C and 0.5 C respectively after 100 cycles. Thus, the combination of solution drop and nitrogen doping opens a new chapter for resolving capacity fading as well as long cycling problems and creates a new strategy to increase sulfur loading in controlled mechanism.

However, they are plagued by rapid capacity decay, low coulombic efficiency, a severe shuttle effect and low sulfur loading in cathodes. To address these problems, effective carriers are highly demanded to encapsulate sulfur and extend the cycle life. Here, we report an aqueous emulsion approach and in situ sulfur impregnation to synthesize multi-shelled hollow carbon nanosphere-encapsulated sulfur composites with a high percentage of sulfur loading (86 wt%). When applied as cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries, the composite materials delivered a high specific capacity of 1350 mA h g(-1) and excellent capacity retention (92% for 200 cycles). Further measurements at high current densities also demonstrate significantly enhanced cyclability and high rate capability.

Here, a 3D NPC@S/3D NPC@Li full cell is reported based on 3D hierarchical and continuously porous nickel photonic crystal (NPC) to solve the problems of sulfur cathode and lithium anode at the same time. In this case, the 3D NPC@S cathode can not only offer a fast transfer of electron and lithium ion, but also effectively prevent the dissolution of polysulfides and the tremendous volume change during cycling, and the 3D NPC@Li anode can efficiently inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites and volume expansion, too. As a result, the cell exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1383 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C (the current density of 837 mA g(-1)), superior rate ability (the reversible capacity of 735 mAh g(-1) at the extremely high current density of 16 750 mA g(-1)) with excellent coulombic efficiency of about 100% and an excellent cycle life over 500 cycles with only about 0.026% capacity loss per cycle.

Herein, the novel and facile methods are employed to fabricate 3D hierarchical Ti3C2Tx@AlF3/Ni(OH)(2) via one-step conversion of Ti3AlC2 to layered Ti3C2Tx@AlF3, followed by the decoration of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. The stable layered Ti3C2Tx substrate boosts the electron conductivity upon cycling, while the produced polar AlF3 nanoparticles which are dispersed on the surface and in the interlayer of Ti3C2Tx show strong chemisorption with polysulfides. Moreover, the package of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets can serve as the physical baffle and play the critical role in effectively inhibiting the migration of soluble polysulfides and enhancing the redox kinetic of adsorbed polysulfides. Therefore, the Ti3C2Tx@AlF3-S/Ni(OH)(2) hybrid as cathode materials of Li-S battery exhibits high discharge capacity of 1184 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2C, improved rate capability of 854 mAh.g(-1) at 1C and 635 mAh.g(-1) at 4C, as well as remarkable cycling stability of low capacity decay rate of 0.048% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1C.

Although several microporous carbon materials as host for sulfur reveal the effect, methods for producing microporous carbon are neither easy nor well controllable. Moreover, due to the complexity and limitation of microporous carbon in their fabrication process, there has been rare investigation of influence on electrochemical behavior in the carbonate-based electrolyte for lithium-sulfur batteries by tuning different micropore size(0-2 nm) of carbon host. Here, we demonstrate an immediate carbonization process, self-activation strategy, which can produce microporous carbon for a sulfur host from alkali-complexes. Besides, by changing different alkali-ion in the previous complex, the obtained microporous carbon exhibits a major portion of ultramicropore (< 0.7 nm, from 54.9% to 25.8%) and it is demonstrated that the micropore structure of the host material plays a vital role in confining sulfur molecule. When evaluated as cathode materials in a carbonate-based electrolyte for Li-S batteries, such microporous carbon/sulfur composite can provide high reversible capacity, cycling stability and good rate capability.

However, the commercial application of LSBs is hindered due to the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle as well as the sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, cobalt selenide (Co0.85Se) nanowire arrays have been constructed on a carbon-modified separator by an in-situ electrodeposition technique without any other post-treatments such as coating with other ancillary materials. The introduced three-dimensional (3D) conductive carbon layer comprising of carbon nanotube (CNT) and acetylene black (AB) not only serves as the effective support for Co0.85Se (CS) but also builds a hierarchical structure to promote the e transfer. The as-obtained CS-CNT/AB presents a strong anchoring effect on LiPSs and high electrocatalytic activity for sulfur reaction kinetics. As a result, the LSBs inserted with electrodeposition-enabled CS modified separator exhibit an outstanding rate capability (1560.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and relatively low capacity decay of only 0.068% per cycle over 500 cycles at 2.0 C. This study provides a promising strategy to realize the rational construction of high-efficiency and long-life LSBs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, they also have lots of drawbacks to be overcome, such as poor conductivity, severe volume expansion, and serious "shuttle effect''. In this work, reduced graphene oxide/molybdenum dioxide (rGO/MoO2) composite is synthesized and applied to modify polypropylene separator. The modified polypropylene separator introduces synergistic tri-functions of physical adsorption, chemical interaction and catalytic effects, which can inhibit the "shuttle effect'' and enhance the electrochemical performances of lithium-sulfur batteries. In the prepared rGO/MoO2 composite, the polar MoO2 chemically adsorbs the intermediate lithium polysulfide, while the rGO with good electrical conductivity not only acts as a physical barrier to prevent diffusion of polysulfide ions, but also improves the conversion efficiency of active material intercepted on the separator. As a consequence, the battery assembled with rGO/MoO2 modified polypropylene separator exhibits a reversible capacity of 757.5 mAh.g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C with a negligible capacity decay of 0.207% per cycle, which indicates a good long-period cycling stability. Furthermore, the rate performance and self-discharge suppression are also improved by introducing modified polypropylene separator. It shows that rGO/MoO2 composite is a promising material for separator modification in lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this work, functionalized carbonized mesoporous wood fiber (f-CMWF) is employed as a host to accommodate sulfur for the first time. Natural wood microfiber has unique hierarchical and mesoporous structure, which is well-maintained after carbonization. With such a hierarchical mesoporous, structure, a high sulfur lOading of 76 wt % is achieved in CMWF electrodes. The pore size of CMWF istunable by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a 5 nm Al2O3 coating to form the f-CMVVV. Such a thin layer slightly decreases the sulfur loading to 70%, but it remarkably promotes the cyclic stability of sulfur cathode, which delivers an initial capacity of 1115 mAh g(-1) and maintains a reversible capacity of 859 mAh el for 450 Cycles, corresponding to a slow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle. More importantly, natural wood microfiber is first used as a raw material for sulfUr encapsulating. This work is also critical for using low cost and mesoporous biomass carbon as bifunctional scaffold for LSB.

Rational design of titanium oxide-coated dual Core-Shell sulfur nanocomposite cathode for highly stable lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS			English	Article						Lithium/sulfur battery; Hollow carbon nanospheres; Titanium oxide; Dual core-shell structure; Capacity retention; Polysulfide shuttle; Shuttle mechanism; Polysulfide barrier		Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as one of the promising next-generation energy storage systems due to their high specific capacity and energy density compared to intercalated metal oxide-based lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the bottleneck that prevents commercialization of LSBs is how to tackle the polysulfide shuttle (PSS) effect, including low conductivity and dramatic volume change of the cathode material, which lead to rapid capacity fading and poor cycle life. In this paper, a new LSB cathode material with a nano-sized structure of sulfur encapsulated TiO2-coated dual core-shell hollow carbon sphere (S@HCS@TiO2) has been developed. The inner hollow carbon sphere (HCS) with a foamy carbon shell provides space for volumetric expansion, good electronic and ionic conductivity; while the outside TiO2 shell is not only a physical barrier to polysulfide species, but also possesses a strong chemical interaction with polysulfides. As a result, the obtained Li-S cells with S@HCS@TiO2 cathode material display a high initial capacity (751.6 mA h g(-1)) and low capacity decay (0.039% per cycle) for 800 cycles at a high current density (1C).

Specifically, the effects of thickness, surface area, and pore size distribution of carbon nanofiber (CNF) interlayers on the performance of Li-S batteries have been studied. The carbon nanofiber interlayer not only reduces the electrochemical resistance but also localizes the migrating polysulfides and traps them, thereby improving the discharge capacity as well as cyclability. It was found that the optimum thickness of the interlayer is a critical factor to achieve good cell performance, in addition to the surface area and pore structure. A high initial discharge capacity of 1549 mA h g(-1) at C/5 rate, which is 92% of the theoretical capacity of sulfur, with 98% average coulombic efficiency and 83% capacity retention after 100 cycles was obtained with a meso-microporous carbon nanofiber interlayer.

However, some technical problems still limit the commercialization value of Li-S batteries such as poor electrical conductivity, shuttle effects, and volume expansion. To overcome the aforementioned issues, N-doped carbon composites were synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method. To obtain different N-doping configurations, a carbon precursor was annealed at different heating rates, resulting in different N-containing properties. The cell with the most content of pyridinic-N delivered the highest initial discharge capacity of similar to 1121 mAh g(-1), and the specific capacity still retained 605 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles.

However, the dissolution of polysulfides in electrolytes and their undesirable shuttle behavior lead to poor cycling performance, which obstructs practical application. Herein, we report a dual-sulfur-fixing mechanism of epoxy/allyl compound/sulfur system to prepare poly(sulfur-random-4-vinyl-1,2-epoxycyclohexane) (SVE) co-polymers as powerful cathode materials. Benefiting from the stable C-S bond and a uniform distribution of ultrafine Li2S/S-8 in the SVE-based polymer matrix, the SVE electrodes exerted an embedding effect to reduce polysulfides migration. The thiosulfate/polythionate protective layer derived from the terminal hydroxyl group of SVE also ensured the cycle stability of SVE electrodes during cycling. As a result, optimized SVE electrodes deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 1248 mA h g(-1) at rates of 0.1 C, together with a stable cycling performance of no capacity decay per cycle over more than 400 cycles. This work provides an effective strategy for the practical application of organosulfur polymers Li-S batteries and inspires the exploration of the reaction mechanism of epoxy/allyl compound/sulfur system.

However, its commercialization is hindered seriously by the low loading and utilization rate of sulfur cathodes. Herein, we designed the cellulose-based graphene carbon composite aerogel (CCA) self-standing electrode to enhance the performance of Li-S batteries. The CCA contributes to the mass loading and utilization efficiency of sulfur, because of its unique physical structure: low density (0.018 g cm(-3)), large specific surface area (657.85 m(2) g(-1)), high porosity (96%), and remarkable electrolyte adsorption (42.25 times). Compared to Al (about 49%), the CCA displayed excellent sulfur use efficiency (86%) and could reach to high area capacity of 8.60 mAh cm(-2) with 9.11 mg S loading. Meanwhile, the CCA exhibits the excellent potential for pulse sensing applications due to its flexibility and superior sensitivity to electrical response signals. (C) 2020 Science China Press.

In this paper, porous biochar is fabricated by easily obtained folium cycas. Acetic acid (HAc) is used to clean the ash content in cavity and solve the problem of pore blockage. The results showed that the folium cycas biochar (FCB) treated with HAc increased the specific surface area by 44.7% (2954 m(2)/g) and the cumulative pore volume by 67.5% (1.39 cm(3)/g). The FCB has rich nano-scale meso/microporous tubular pores which provide a natural high-efficiency space for sulfur storage and buffer the volume expansion, so that the prepared composite cathode material of FCB/S has a first discharge capacity of up to 1317 mAh/g and stable at 910 mAh/g after 5 cycles.

The prime factors that affect the performance are enormous volume change of the electrode, soluble intermediate product formation, poor electronic and ionic conductivity of S, and end discharge products (i.e., Li2S2 and Li2S). The attractive way to mitigate these challenges underlying in the fabrication of a sulfur nanocomposite electrode consisting of different nanoparticles with distinct properties of lithium storage capability, mechanical reinforcement, and ionic as well as electronic conductivity leading to a mechanically robust and mixed conductive (ionic and electronic conductive) sulfur electrode. Herein, we report a novel bottom-up approach to synthesize a unique freestanding, flexible cathode scaffold made of porous reduced graphene oxide, nanosized sulfur, and Mn3O4 nanoparticles, and all are three-dimensionally interconnected to each other by hybrid polyaniline/sodium alginate (PANI-SA) matrix to serve individual purposes. A capacity of 1098 mAh g(-1) is achieved against lithium after 200 cycles at a current rate of 2 A g-1 with 97.6% of initial capacity at a same current rate, suggesting the extreme stability and cycling performance of such electrode. Interestingly, with the higher current density of 5 A g(-1), the composite electrode exhibited an initial capacity of 1015 mA h g(-1) and retained 71% of the original capacity after 500 cycles. The in situ Raman study confirms the polysulfide absorption capability of Mn3O4. This work provides a new strategy to design a mechanically robust, mixed conductive nanocomposite electrode for high-performance lithium sulfur batteries and a strategy that can be used to develop flexible large power storage devices.

However, the shuttle effect caused by soluble polysulfides is generally considered to be an insurmountable challenge, which can significantly reduce the battery lifecycle and sulfur utilization. Here, we report a lignin nanoparticle-coated Celgard (LC) separator to alleviate this problem. The LC separator enables abundant electron-donating groups and is expected to induce chemical binding of polysulfides to hinder the shuttle effect. When a sulfur-containing commercially available acetylene black (approximately 73.8 wt% sulfur content) was used as the cathode without modification, the Li-S battery with the LC separator presented much enhanced cycling stability over that with the Celgard separator for over 500 cycles at a current density of 1 C. The strategy demonstrated in this study is expected to provide more possibilities for the utilization of low-cost biomass-derived nanomaterials as separators for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, dissolution of the intermediate polysulfide species into the electrolyte remains as a major challenge, causing fast capacity degradation in Li-S batteries. Many recent studies have reported various materials such as metal oxides and sulfides that interact strongly with polysulfide species and can alleviate the dissolution problem, though little work has focused on quantitative comparison of different materials under equivalent conditions. Here, we establish a standard procedure to quantitatively compare the polysulfide adsorption capability of candidate materials. We found that an order of magnitude of difference is evident between poor adsorption materials such as carbon black and strong adsorption materials such as V2O5 and MnO2. We elucidate different adsorption mechanisms may be present and probe possible adsorption species. We expect our work will provide a useful strategy to screen for suitable candidate materials and valuable information for rational design of long cycle life Li-S batteries.

Herein, Nitrogen, Oxygen and Cobalt multiple-doped graphitized mesoporous carbon sulfur composites (N-O-Co-C/S) with high sulfur content (90%) are developed via inexpensive carbonization methods. The composites exhibit superior performance with a capacity of 610 mAh g(-1) at a current of 0.5 C after 200 cycles and 302 mAh g(-1) at a current of 2 C after 1400 cycles. The superior performance of N-O-Co-C/S composites can be attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity and ionic conductivity of Co-N-O-C/S composites, which can be supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement. The polysulfide-trapping was mainly attributed to the strong O-S, N-S and Co-S interactions, thus improving the e electrochemical performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics of the polysulfides severely hinders the development of Li-S batteries. To overcome these issues, a prismatic-like N-doped carbon tubes embedded with Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-PNCT) as an efficient sulfur host for advanced Li-S batteries is rationally designed and prepared by a self-templating method in this work. With the high conductivity and hollow structure, the Fe3O4-PNCT can effectively accelerate electron and ion transfer rate, relieve volume expansion and anchor polysulfides intermediates. More importantly, polar Fe3O4 as electrocatalysts uniformly distributed embedding in hollow N-doped carbon shell can not only efficiently adsorb polysulfides on the conductive sulfur host surface, but also significantly promote catalyze transformation of polysulfides, which has been actually revealed by experiments and DFT results. Benefiting from these merits, the sulfur cathode with Fe3O4-PNCT delivers excellent electrochemical performances including high sulfur utilization (1375 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C), superior rate performance (685 mAh g(-1) at 5C) and remarkable cycling stability up to 1000 cycles at 5C with a super low capacity-fade rate of 0.03% per cycle. This work illustrates the importance of desired design and anchoring-conversion in sulfur electrode, offering some lights on the construction of multifunctional sulfur hosts for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Acetylene black as conductive carbon skeleton and graphene nanosheets as physical shields played an extremely important role for improving the electrochemical performances of the AB/S@G cathode. Compared with the AB/S cathode, the AB/S@G cathode with a sulfur content of 54 wt% exhibited a high utilization of sulfur, an enhanced cyclical stability, and an excellent rate capability. The AB/S@G cathode came true a high sulfur utilization of 95.73% after undergoing a high initial discharge capacity of 1603.5 mAh g (1) at a current density of 200 mAg (1), much higher than that (71.78%) of the AB/S cathode. The excellent electrochemical performances were principally attributed to the combined effect of graphene nanosheets and acetylene black, which provided an improved electrical conductivity for the sulfur cathode, effective restraining for soluble polysulfides, and powerful buffer for the volume changes of sulfur during cycling.

The MOF-74-Ni/CNT was characterized and the electrochemical performance was investigated. The composite sulfur cathode prepared by impregnation method delivers a high initial discharge capacity, good rate capability and a low capacity decay of 0.087% per cycle over 400 cycles at 2 C. The significant electrochemical performance was attributed to the combination of the high affinity of MOF-74-Ni to polysulfide anions and the excellent electronic conductivity of carbon nanotube. These results suggest the design of high polar MOF materials with high conductive CNT is an effective strategy to construct a promising sulfur host for Li-S batteries.

A novel strategy for high-stability lithium sulfur batteries by in situ formation of polysulfide adsorptive-blocking layer	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; High-stability; Lanthanum sulfide (La2S3); In situ; Polysulfide adsorptive-blocking layer (PAL)	HIGH-POROSITY; CARBON; CATHODES; PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN; COMPOSITES; ELECTROLYTE; CAPACITY; REDOX; SHELL	Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries are one of the most promising energy storage devices owing to their high energy and power density. However, the shuttle effect as a key barrier hinders its practical application by resulting in low coulombic efficiency and poor cycling performance. Herein, a novel design of in situ formed polysulfide adsorptive-blocking layer (PAL) on the cathode surface was developed to tame the polysulfide shuttling and promote the cycling stability for Li-S batteries. The PAL is consisted of La2S3, which is capable to chemically adsorb polysulfide via the strong interaction of La-S bond and S-S bond, and build an effective barrier against sulfur escaping. Moreover, the La2S3 is capable to suppress the crystallization of Li2S and promote the ion transfer, which contributes to the reduced internal resistance of batteries. Furthermore, the by-product LiNO3 simultaneously forms a stable anode solid and electrolyte interface to further inhibit the polysulfide shuttle. By this simple and convenient method, the resultant Li-S batteries achieved exceptional cycling stability with an ultralow decay rate of 0.055% since the 10th cycle. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, aiming the application of Li-S at high current rates, we coupled a sp(2) carbon configuration consisting of 3D carbon nanotubes/graphene prepared by ultrahigh temperature treatment (2850 degrees C) with S (2850CNTs-Gra-S) for application in Li-S batteries. The 2850CNTs-Gra as the host material exhibits a nearly perfect sp(2) hybridized structure because ultrahigh temperature treatment not only repairs the raw defects in CNTs and graphene, but it also forms new sp(2) C-C bonds between them. The 3D sp(2) carbon network ensures ultrafast ion/electron transfer and efficient heat dissipation to protect the integrity of the separator when the Li-S battery is running at an ultrahigh rate. Based on these unique advantages, the 2850CNTs-Gra-S cathode shows a high current rate performance. Critically, it still delivers a considerable specific capacity after 1500 cycles even at a current rate of 15C and exhibits an extremely low capacity degradation rate of 0.0087% per cycle.

However, one of their major technical problems is the shuttling of soluble polysulfides between electrodes, resulting in rapid capacity fading. Here, we present a metal-organic framework (MOF)-based battery separator to mitigate the shuttling problem. We show that the MOF-based separator acts as an ionic sieve in lithium-sulfur batteries, which selectively sieves Li+ ions while efficiently suppressing undesired polysulfides migrating to the anode side. When a sulfur-containing mesoporous carbon material (approximately 70 wt% sulfur content) is used as a cathode composite without elaborate synthesis or surface modification, a lithium-sulfur battery with a MOF-based separator exhibits a low capacity decay rate (0.019% per cycle over 1,500 cycles). Moreover, there is almost no capacity fading after the initial 100 cycles. Our approach demonstrates the potential for MOF-based materials as separators for energy-storage applications.

The rational integration of three dimensional (3D) carbon skeletons into sulfur cathode is an efficient and effective route to full use of conductive scaffolds with chemical and mechanical stability and ability to accommodate large amount of active materials. Herein, a 3D freestanding electrode composed of nitrogen-doped porous graphene/sulfur composite granular and super-long carbon nanotube (CNT) skeleton is proposed for Li-S batteries with high volumetric energy density. With a facile calendering process, the mechanical properties, bulk conductivity, and the pore distribution of the flexible graphene@S-CNT electrodes were tuned. The high rate capability, long-life stability, and high volumetric energy density of Li-S batteries are highly depended on the nano structure evolution of composite carbon/sulfur electrode. A high rate capability of 40% retention of discharge capacity of 2.0 C against that at 0.05 C, a high cyclic stability of 0.1%/cycle within 180 cycles, and a high volumetric energy density over 850 Wh L-1 are demonstrated with the pressed graphene@S-CNT electrode.

However, Li-S batteries exhibit poor cycling stability during the practical test, mainly because of the detrimental shuttle effect of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Here, we report a common and scalable strategy to prepare freestanding membranes of MnO2 sheet arrays anchored on natural cotton-derived hollow carbon fibers (MnO2/HCFs), which as interlayers can mitigate shuttling of LiPSs and thus boost the durabilities of Li-S batteries. By combining ultraviolet-visible absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we find that a MnO2/HCF interlayer can trap the LiPSs through chemical interactions between LiPSs and MnO2. With a MnO2/HCF interlayer, the Li-S battery shows a satisfactory capacity of 970 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) with a capacity decay of merely 0.12% per cycle over 500 cycles.

The outer and inside shells of the hollow quasi-polyhedral structure were formed by many interconnected nanosheets with a lot of micro-holes. It could be found that this unique 3D structure material could be well applied to lithium sulfur battery (LSB). The NiCoP material with a huge specific surface area (1539.2 m(2) g(-1)) allowed for high loading of sulfur. The NiCoP material strongly adsorbed polysulfides because their natural oxidation (forming Ni-O-P, Co-O-P-like species) activated the Co/Ni sites for binding polysulfides via strong Co-S, Ni-S bonding. In particular, NiCoP hollow quasi-polyhedra exhibited higher binding energy than CoP. The results revealed that this composite had a specific discharge capacity up to 815.3 mAh/g at the first cycle and remained 620 mAh/g after cycling for 200 at 0.1C with almost 100% coulombic efficiency.

The functional interlayer of NW(Ni/C)NFs is sandwiched between a sulfur cathode and the separator and acts as a shuttle inhibitor to sulfur and polysulfides. Because of the sandwiched structure and the nickel additive, the Li-S cell shows better performance in terms of capacity utilization and reversibility. When the NW(Ni/C)NFs were calcined at 900 degrees C with 1 g of nickel salt additive, the discharge capacity of the cells was the best, and the initial discharge capacity was 1062 mAh g(-1). With 200 charge-discharge cycles at 1 C, the discharge capacity of the cells remained above 910 mAh g(-1), which is about 857% of its initial capacity. The improvement to the cells' electrochemical performance is attributed to the 3D architecture of the NW(Ni/C)NFs as a functional interlayer and to the appropriate amount of nickel addition. This provides a good conductive network with structural stability and the migrating polysulfide reduces the "shuttling phenomenon" during the charge-discharge processes.

The fractional use of three building blocks in biomass became an urgent challenge to be faced. Herein, we report an autohydrolysis-aided biorefinery for the sequential conversion of wheat straw hemicelluloses, cellulose and lignin into xylooligosaccharides (XOS), fermentable glucose and lithium-sulfur cathode at the end of the process, respectively. The yield of XOS (DP of 2-6) reached up to 24.06% (w/w) of xylan and 6.19% (w/w) of the initial biomass. The hydrothermal treatment removed the amorphous portion and disrupted the rigid structure, thereby improving the cellulose digestibility from 14.1 to 88.9%. The molecular weights, functional groups and structural features of residual lignin after enzymatic hydrolysis were thoroughly explored for the cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries via the carbonizing process. Because of the considerable surface area, the covalent linkage between the lignin-derived carbon (LC) and sulfur, and the uniform dispersion of sulfur particles, the developed LC@S cathode exhibited excellent rate capability, and the specific capacity of 1238, 1085 and 1035 mA h g(-1) at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 C, respectively. The LC@S cathode retained 596 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C with a coulombic efficiency of 92%. The present study provides a systematic strategy that bears the primary responsibility for exploiting biomass into a potential feedstock with worthwhile functions in the thriving domains of chemicals, biofuels and energy storage devices.

The carbon used in this work was obtained from kombucha tea or tea fungus with potassium hydroxide activation process. The flaky structure of functionalized carbon derived from a waste part of kombucha culture has micropores and mesopores with a large pore volume, which are favorable for impregnating elemental sulfur. The ration of the ternary composite was based on a simple process involving a dispersion of the carbon with that of S/PAN, followed by a simple heat treatment. The cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1666 mAh g(-1) at C/10 rate and a 100th cycle capacity of 838 mAh g(-1). This study exploits the cumulative contribution of a conductive carbon and PAN in the improved performance of the cathode.

In this work, ZIF-8 nanocrystals attached on reduced graphene oxide (ZIF-8@rGO) was prepared through a hydrothermal process and subsequent in-situ conversion reaction. When served as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries, the ZIF-8@rGO/S nanocomposite delivered a discharge capacity of 523 mAh g(-1) for 0.2 A g(-1) over 200 cycles along with a high Coulombic efficiency, exhibiting an improved long-term cycle stability. Such an improved cycle stability is related to the unique merits of ZIF-8@rGO/S nanocomposite, including tight combination, excellent conductivity, abundant reactive sites and adequate specific surface area. Consequently, the in-situ conversion reaction strategy could be also used to construct many other graphene-based nanocomposites as sulfur hosts to enhance their electrochemical performances in lithium-sulfur batteries.

To address this issue, we fabricate a tannic acid/Fe-III complex-coated polypropylene (PP) separator (TA/Fe-III-PP separator) via a simple, fast, and green method. Benefiting from dual-confinement effects based on Lewis acid base interactions between Fe-III and polysulfides as well as the dipole dipole interactions between rich phenol groups and polysulfides, the migration of polysulfides is effectively suppressed. Meanwhile, the porous structure of the PP separator is not destroyed by an additional coating layer. Thus, the TA/Fe-III-PP separator can retain rapid lithium ion transport, eventually leading to a significant improvement in both the discharge capacity and rate performance of the corresponding lithium sulfur cells. The cell with the TA/Fe-III-PP separator presents a low capacity fade of 0.06% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2.0 C, along with a high Coulombic efficiency of >97% over 300 cycles at 0.5 C. With respect to the one with the bare PP separator, the cell with the TA/Fe-III-PP separator exhibits a 1.7-fold increase in the discharge capacity at 3.0 C. The proposed simple and economical approach shows great potential in constructing advanced separators to retard the shuttle effect of polysulfides for lithium sulfur batteries.

However, due to the shuttling effect of polysulfides, the continuous capacity fading during cycling remains a substantial bumper for the practical use of Li-S batteries. Here, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) materials with different reduction degrees were used as the polysulfide inhibitor and were coated onto glass fiber separators to minimize the shutting of polysulfides. The influence of reduction degree on the effort of polysulfide rejection was investigated. The incorporation of rGO coating with higher reduction degree largely minimized the polysulfide shuttling, thus the Li-S cells with separators modified with high-reduction degree rGO was able to maintain a capacity of 733 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles and delivered a high capacity of 519 mAh g(-1) at 2C, which were 42% and 90% higher than those of cells with separators coated with low-reduction degree rGO. Therefore, it was found that rGO with higher reduction degree demonstrated better polysulfide rejection performance than rGO with lower reduction degree. This study provides a promising strategy in the rGO selection for high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The dealloying processing forms an interconnected porous structure with high porosity (0.39 cm(3) g(-1)) and large surface area (82.39 m(2) g(-1)). The specific structure provides effective contact between sulfur and host material, thus trapping the polysulfide intermediates and suppressing the shuttle effect. The resulting S/TiO2 composites exhibit excellent cycling and rate performance, which maintained 641 mAh g(-1) at 200th cycle at 0.2 C, and 600 mAh g(-1) at 2.5 C. The coulombic efficiency remains at nearly 99% except for the first cycle. This excellent electrochemical performance of S/TiO2 composites can be attributed to the strong electrostatic attraction between metal-oxygen bond and polysulfides and structural restriction to encapsulate sulfur of hierarchically porous TiO2.

The microstructure and morphology of the activated porous sulfur-carbon composite is characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and scanning electron microscopy. The functioning mechanism of the additive on the pore formation is investigated using thermogravimetric analysis. Our results establish that thermal decomposition of the nano-CaCO3 template results in the formation of the hierarchical porous carbon structure, and addition of Cu(Ac)(2) influences the carbonization process in an un-homogeneous way through the copper ion-sucrose reaction, resulting in the volume increment of small mesopores. The sample obtained shows better sulfur dispersion in the active porous carbon than that synthesized without Cu(Ac)(2) involvement, which is attributable to the modified pore structure and enlarged pore volume. Thus, a better utilization of sulfur is achieved and the initial discharge capacity increases from 1,287 to 1,397 mAh g(-1). Furthermore, the Li-S battery shows improved cycle stability because of enhanced interaction between the sulfur and the small mesopore.

Nevertheless, most of the reported catalysts are only effective for LiPSs reduction, resulting in the devitalization of catalysts over extended cycles as a consequence of the continuous accumulation of Li2S passivation layer. The situation gets even worse when employing mono-directional catalyst with poor electron conductivity because the charge transfer for the decomposition of solid Li2S is severely hampered. Herein, a high-conductive and dual-directional catalyst Co3C decorated on porous nitrogen-doped graphene-like structure and carbon nanotube (Co3C@PNGr-CNT) is fabricated as sulfur host, which not only promotes the precipitation of Li2S from LiPSs during discharge but also facilitates the decomposition of Li2S during subsequent charge, as evidenced by the reduced activation energies for both reduction and oxidation processes. Furthermore, the long-term catalytic stability of Co3C is corroborated by the reversible evolution of Co-C bond length over extended cycles as observed from X-ray absorption fine structure results. As a consequence, the fabricated Co3C@PNGr-CNT/S cathode delivers a low capacity decay of 0.043% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2C. Even at high sulfur loading (15.6 mg cm(-2)) and low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (similar to 8 mu L mg(-1)) conditions, the battery still delivers an outstanding areal capacity of 11.05 mAh cm(-2) after 40 cycles. This work provides a rational strategy for designing high-efficient bidirectional catalyst with single component for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Here, we successfully prepared ZnO quantum dot-modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO@ZnO QDs), and first introduced it into Li-S cathodes (rGO@ZnO QDs/S). Due to its merits of a catalysis effect and enhancing the reaction kinetics, low surface impedance, and efficient adsorption of polysulfide, rGO@ZnO QDs/S presented excellent rate capacity with clear discharge plateaus even at a high rate of 4C, and superb cycle performance. An initial discharge capacity of 998.8 mA h g(-1)was delivered, of which 73.3% was retained after 400 cycles at a high rate of 1C.

The potassium hydroxide activation process results in a significantly enhanced specific surface area with numerous small pores. The as-obtained PCNTs are employed as the conductive matrix for sulfur in the sulfur cathode. Compared with the composite sulfur cathode based on the original MWCNTs, the sulfur-PCNTs cathode shows a significantly improved cycle performance and columbic efficiency. The reversible capacity is 530 mAhg(-1) and columbic efficiency is 90 % after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mAg(-1). The improvement in the electrochemical performance for S-PCNTis mainly attributed to the enlarged surface area and the porous structure of the unique mesopores carbon nanotube host, which cannot only facilitate transport of electrons and Li+ ions, but also trap polysulfides, retard the shuttle effect during charge/discharge process.

High-rate lithium-sulfur batteries enabled by hierarchical porous carbons synthesized via ice templation	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Hierarchical porous carbons; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Cyclic performance; Porosity dependence; Lithium nitrate	ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; COMPOSITE	We report the performance of a series of hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) with extremely high surface areas of up to 2340 m(2) g(-1) with total pore volume of up to 3.8 cm(3) g(-1) as supports for sulfur for Li-S batteries. The hierarchical structure of the carbon originating from interconnected large mesopores (10-50 nm), small mesopores (2-10 nm) and micropores (<2 nm) makes the total available surface area highly accessible, resulting in excellent electrode kinetics. At high C-rates of 2 C and 5 C, large specific capacities of 647 mA h g(-1) and 503 mA h g(-1), respectively, were obtained after 200 cycles. In addition, we also systematically show that the cyclic stability is independent of the size of the pores sulfur is initially confined in, when LiNO3 is used as the electrolyte additive, indicating that capacity fade due to polysulfide shuttle is effectively eliminated and that it is not related to pore size anymore.

However, the intrinsic shortages including serious shuttling behavior and lithium dendrites growth, are deemed as stumbling blocks on the way of commercializing LSBs. Also, the inferior thermostability and flame retardancy of common separator may cause safety hazard to LSBs. Here, the designing of thermotolerant and flame-resistant PAN-based separator (MPAN) via surface engineering with heteroatoms doped carbon framework encapsulated with CoS2 nanocatalysts, is proposed. By utilizing MPAN separators, the efficient hinderances on shuttling behavior and marked promotions in polysulfides conversion are achieved, leading to the superior electrochemical properties. Notably, the cycling performances of LSBs under high temperature are obviously enhanced. As expected, the inhibited dendrites growth is obtained, corroborating the improved safety of LSBs. In short, this work may shed a light on constructing thermotolerant and flame-resistant separator with efficacy in suppressing shuttling behavior and lithium dendrites growth.

Yildirim			Li-S batteries: effect of uniaxial compression on the electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance of graphene aerogel cathodes	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article; Early Access						Boron-doped graphene aerogel; Cathode; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Compression effects; Conductivity	BORON-DOPED GRAPHENE; GRAPHITE OXIDE; SULFUR; ANODE; ULTRALIGHT; ELECTRODE; SHEETS	Porous cathodes are preferred to be used in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries for better impregnation of the active material. On the other hand, the electrochemical performances of Li-S cells are mostly correlated with the free pore volume of the cathode hosts; however, their electrical conductivities were rarely reported in the existing literature. In this work, lightweight, 3D spongy boron-doped graphene aerogel cathodes were prepared and their electrical conductivity values were found to increase under the uniaxial compression through the vertical axis. The variation of the uniaxial compression corresponds to the fluctuations in the pressure of the springs during the assembly of Li-S cells, which resulted in the diversity of the cell performance containing the same cathode material. The electrical conductivity of the cathode was determined to be nearly constant up to a compressive strain of 60% but increased significantly from 60 to 80%. In parallel, electrical conductivity of the cathode increased with the accompanying increase of the aerogel density from 0.04 to 0.08 g.cm(-3). In addition, the electrochemical performances of the aerogel cathodes having the same amount of active material were investigated in Li-S batteries when different uniaxial compressions were applied. It was found that the aerogel cathode having 40% uniaxial compression exhibited the best stable discharge capacity (similar to 440 mAh.g(-1) over 100 cycles). These results indicate that both electrical conductivity and porosity properties of graphene cathodes should be considered simultaneously to obtain reliable Li-S cell performances.

Herein, we report a sulfur-hydrazine hydrate chemistry-based method to prepare the composite of sulfur and N-doped reduced graphene oxide (S@N-rGO) with 76% sulfur content. Relying on the reaction of sulfur and hydrazine hydrate, cyclo-sulfur was broken to form soluble polysulfides. The subsequent refluxing with GO suspension rendered the transformation of soluble polysulfides to sulfur crystal homogeneously deposited on N-rGO due to direct nucleation from solution. Simultaneously, the nitrogen doping of GO was realized with hydrazine hydrate as doping agent in the one-pot route. The as-obtained S@N-rGO composite displayed a good rate capability and excellent capacity stability up to 300 cycles. This study may provide a new and facile method to construct the composite of sulfur and N-doped carbonaceous matrix, which makes the hybrid a competitive cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs).

Herein, a novel ultra-thin sandwich-type Ni-doped MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (denote as Ni-doped MoS2/rGO) hybrid is developed as a sulfur host through a simple one-step hydrothermal route. The two-dimensional layered structure Ni-doped MoS2/rGO hybrid with heterostructure and heteroatom architecture defects not only plays a key role in adsorption of lithium polysulfide but also catalyzes on redox kinetics of sulfur and polysulfide species. Meanwhile, it can contribute to the large specific surface area for Li2S/S-8 deposition, fast Li-ion and electron transportation, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic properties, as confirmed firstly by cyclic voltammetry (CV) results. Due to the adsorption-catalytic synergistic effect, the Ni-doped MoS2/rGO cathode exhibits high specific capacity (1343.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, 921.6 mA h g(-1) at 1 C), high coulombic efficiency and an outstanding cycle stability (with the low attenuation rate of 0.077% per cycle over 140 cycles at 0.5 C and 0.11% per cycle over 400 cycles at 1 C, respectively). This work proposes some inspiration for exploring the construction of advanced lithium-sulfur batteries through the rational design defects of atomic structure and electronic states of MoS2 as sulfur host.

To address such issues, a novel core-shell Fe9S10/Fe3O4@C architecture with well-defined heterointerfaces as a multifunctional polysulfides barrier for Li-S batteries is reported here. The spherical Fe9S10/Fe3O4@C heterostructure can be prepared by spray-drying technology on a large-scale and followed by a one-pot in-situ carbothermal reaction. With both physical entrapments by carbon shells and strong chemical interaction with Fe9S10/Fe3O4 heterostructure cores, this constructed dense-packing architecture alleviates the shuttle effect. The mechanisms involved in the Fe9S10/Fe3O4@C trapping interlayer are confirmed by both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, due to its high conductivity and intrinsic catalytic activity, the Fe9S10/Fe3O4@C facilitates fast electron/ion transport and greatly improves the conversion of LiPSs. Benefit from the integrated trapping-catalyzing effect, the Li-S cell constructed with a Fe9S10/Fe3O4@C interlayer exhibits enhanced cycling stability (a low capacity fading rate of 0.08% per cycle for 500 cycles at 1 C) and outstanding rate performance (660 mAh g-1 at 5 C). Even under a high areal sulfur loading of 3 mg cm-2, the high discharge capacity and capacity retention ratio can also be obtained. This work offers an insight into the construction of multi-functional heterostructures for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Based on the method, series of NACs with similar surface area and pore texture but different nitrogen content and nitrogen group species are successfully prepared. The influence of nitrogen doping on electrochemical performance of carbon/sulfur composites cathode is studied deeply under the conditions of similar surface area and pore texture. It presents the directly experimental demonstration that both nitrogen content and nitrogen group species play crucial roles on electrochemical performance of carbon/sulfur composites cathode. NAC/sulfur composites show the much improved cycling performance, which is about 3.5 times as that of nitrogen free carbon. Improved electrochemical performance is due to synergistic effects between nitrogen content and effective nitrogen groups, which enables effective trapping of lithium polysulfides within carbon framework. Besides, it is found that oxygen groups exist in carbon materials obviously influence electrochemical performance of cathode, which could be ignored in most of studies. Based on above, it can be concluded that enhanced chemisorption to lithium polysulfides by functional groups modification is the effective route to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery.

Furthermore, GCN has been demonstrated to exhibit a chemical interaction with polysulfides because of functional pyridinic nitrogen atoms, thus representing promising properties for application in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, an oxygen-doped hexagonal tubular carbon nitride (O-TCN) is obtained through a simple hydrolysis and pyrolysis approach. The tubular structure favors electrolyte infiltration and accommodates the volume change of sulfur during the redox reaction. Moreover, O-TCN/S with a high content of pyridinic N of about 80 wt% as the sulfur host is beneficial for trapping various polysulfide intermediates via numerous strong N-Li chemical interactions, further facilitating the transformation from high-order polysulfides to low-order Li2S2 or Li2S. As a result, O-TCN delivers a high discharge capacity of 1281 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.05 C for the first cycle, and an excellent reversible capacity of 401 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.064% per cycle, presenting a high sulfur utilization and capacity retention.

Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe-NHC) with Fe-N-x sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped-N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe-NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1 C, the specific capacity is 1079 mA h g(-1) and maintains a low loss of 0.076 % per cycle within 500 cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4 C, a high capacity of 824 mA h g(-1) is still achieved, indicating the advantage of the Fe-NHC/PP separator in LSBs.

Sulfur stored in the large interstitial sites of a PBA host can take advantage of reversible and efficient insertion/extraction of both Li+ and electrons, due to the well-trapped mobile dielectron redox centers in the well-defined host. It is demonstrated that Na2Fe[Fe(CN)(6)] has a large open framework, and as a cathode, it both stores sulfur and acts as a polysulfide diffusion inhibitor based on the Lewis acid-base bonding effect. The electrochemical testing shows that the S@Na2Fe[Fe(CN)(6)]@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) composite achieves excellent reversibility, good stability, and fast kinetics. Its outstanding electrochemical properties should be ascribed to the internal transport of Li+/e-, maximizing the utilization of sulfur. Moreover, the open metal centers serve as the Lewis acid sites with high affinity to the negatively charged polysulfide anions, reducing the diffusion of polysulfides out of the cathode and minimizing the shuttling effect. The fundamental basis of these exceptional performance characteristics is explored through a detailed analysis of the structural and electrochemical behavior of the material. It is believed that the PBAs will have a useful role in ensuring more effective and stable Li-S batteries.

But most of them are less competitive due to the limited theoretical capacity and complicated synthetic process. Herein, we propose a linear molecule sulfur-rich organic material as sulfur cathode, which synthesized by prolonging the linear S-S chain in the commercial tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD). The obtained tetramethylthiuram disulfide-sulfur (TMTD-S) cathode material not only possesses the unique linear structure to maintain its cycling stability, but also have a high active sulfur content to ensure its lithium storage capacity. Thus, the TMTD-S compound delivers an initial capacity of 685 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C (1 C = 1061 mAh g(-1) ) and maintains the capacity at 540 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. Furthermore, when we improve the conductive of TMTD-S cathode material by Ketjen Black agent and carbon cloth current collector, it delivers higher initial capacity as high as 1054 mAh g(-1) and retains 930 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles even at a high current density of 0.5 C and high mass loading of 1.8 mg cm(-2).

Practical operation of Li-S batteries demonstrates lower capacity, poor rate capability, and insufficient cycle life, which can be related to the underlying physicochemical interactions Typical carbon-based porous cathodes undergo coupled electrochemical, chemical, and microstructural evolution during operation. In this work, the mesoscale interaction resulting from the underlying chemical/electrochemical complexations and microstructural evolution is studied in order to elucidate the transient impedance behavior in Li-S battery mesoporous carbon cathodes. The discharge product (e.g., Li2S) precipitation is shown to affect impedance evolution with correlational dependence on the porous cathode microstructure attributes. This mesoscale impedance analytics can be a valuable-virtual probing tool for Li-S battery electrochemical performance.

The results show that the Li2Sn molecules are captured by VS2 with an appropriate adsorption energy ranging from 1.13 eV to 4.44 eV, indicating that VS2 can trap LiPSs stably and effectively through van der Waals and charge transfer mechanisms, which could suppress the shuttle effect. The diffusion of Li atom on VS2 shows a small barrier energy of 0.25 eV. Therefore, VS2 might be a promising anchoring material for Li-S batteries.

Surface Functionalization of Carbon Architecture with Nano-MnO2 for Effective Polysulfide Confinement in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						biomass derived carbon; chemical absorption; lithium-sulfur battery; MnO2; polysulfide confinement	DOPED CARBON; CYCLE LIFE; PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN; CATHODE; SODIUM; SUPERCAPACITORS; NANOFIBERS; SEPARATOR; MECHANISM	Li-S batteries have received tremendous attention owing to their high theoretical capacity (1672 mAhg(-1)), sulfur abundance, and low cost. However, main systemic issues, associated with polysulfide shuttling and low Coulombic efficiency, hinder the practical use of the sulfur electrode in commercial batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an effective strategy of decorating nano-MnO2 (less than 10 wt%) onto the sulfur reservoir to capture the out-diffused polysulfides through chemical interaction and thereby improve the electrochemical performance of the sulfur electrode without increasing the mass burden of total battery configuration. Pistachio shell-derived sustainable carbon (PC) was employed as effective sulfur containers owing to its structural characteristics (interconnected macro channels and micropores). With the aids of the structural benefits of the PC scaffold and the uniform decoration of nano-MnO2, polysulfide shuttling was significantly suppressed and the cycling performance of the sulfur cathode was dramatically improved over 250 cycles.

However, the capacity decay and a shuttle effect are major problems that cause poor coulombic efficiency and a short cycling life. An ordered mesoporous carbon, CMK-3 was oxidized by 67% HNO3, added to a graphene oxide suspension, sonicated, freeze. dried and annealed in NH3 to obtain a nitrogen-doped CMK-3@ graphene hybrid, which was melt-infiltrated with sulfur to prepare a cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. Results indicate that the CMK-3 particles are uniformly dispersed in graphene sheets and their surfaces are coated with graphene. The N-(CMK-3@ G)/S has a reversible discharge capacity of 867. 3 mAh center dot g(-1) after 300 cycles at a current density of 335 mA center dot g-1 with a capacity retention of 82%. Compared with N-CMK-3/S and N-G/S cathodes, the rate performance and polarization characteristics are also improved. The graphene coating on CMK-3 traps soluble polysulfides during the charge/discharge process and nitrogen doping facilitates chemical adsorption of polysulfides to inhibit the shuttle effect, which together improve the performance of the battery.

The LiBH4-LiCl solid-state electrolyte exhibiting a lithium ionic conductivity of log(sigma/S cm(-1))= -3.3 at 373 K, forms a reversible interface with a lithium metal electrode and has a wide electrochemical potential window up to 5 V. By means of the high-energy mechanical ball-milling technique, we prepared a composite powder consisting of elemental sulfur and mixed conductive additive, i.e., Ketjen black and Maxsorb. In that composite powder, homogeneous dispersion of the materials is achieved on a nanometer scale, and thereby a high concentration of the interface among them is induced. Such nanometer-scale dispersals of both elemental sulfur and carbon materials play an important role in enhancing the electrochemical reaction of elemental sulfur. The highly deformable LiBH4-LiCl electrolyte assists in the formation of a high concentration of tight interfaces with the sulfur-carbon composite powder. The LiBH4-LiCl electrolyte also allows the formation of the interface between the positive electrode and the electrolyte layers, and thus the Li-ion transport paths are established at that interface. As a result, our battery exhibits high discharge capacities of 1377, 856, and 636 mAh g(-1) for the 1st, 2nd, and 5th discharges, respectively, at 373 K. These results imply that complex hydride-based solid-state electrolytes that contain Cl-ions in the crystal would be integrated into rechargeable batteries.

A promising candidate is the lithium-sulfur technology with the potential to increase the energy density of the battery by a factor of 3-5. However, so far the many problems with the lithium-sulfur system have not been solved satisfactory. Here we report on a new approach utilizing a self-standing reduced graphene oxide based aerogel directly as electrodes, i.e. without further processing and without the addition of binder or conducting agents. We can thereby disrupt the common paradigm of "no battery without binder" and can pave the way to a lithium-sulfur battery with a high practical energy density. The aerogels are synthesized via a one-pot method and consist of more than 2/3 sulfur, contained inside a porous few-layered reduced graphene oxide matrix. By combining the graphene-based aerogel cathode with an electrolyte and a lithium metal anode, we demonstrate a lithium-sulfur cell with high areal capacity (more than 3 mAh/cm(2) after 75 cycles), excellent capacity retention over 200 cycles and good sulfur utilization. Based on this performance we estimate that the energy density of this concept-cell can significantly exceed the Department of Energy (DEO) 2020-target set for transport applications.

To make maximum use of the two chemical interactions on confining the polysulfides, a novel structure of 2D hexagonal WS2-rimmed Co9S8 heterostructure nanoflakes was designed on the surface of carbon nanofiber (CNF) skeletons via a simple technique. The composite nanoflakes are similar to 50 nm in diameter and similar to 5 nm in thickness, and comprised of a similar to 40nm Co9S8 core and a 3-4 WS2 edge.

Herein, we proposed a strategy that combines TiO-TiO2 heterostructure materials (H-TiOx, x = 1, 2) and conductive polypyrrole (PPy) to form a multifunctional sulfur host. Initially, the TiO-TiO2 heterostructure can enhance the redox reaction kinetics of sulfur species and improve the conductivity of sulfur cathode together with the PPy coating layer. Moreover, the defect-abundant H-TiOx matrices can trap LiPSs by the formation of Ti-S bond via the Lewis acid-base interaction. Furthermore, the PPy coating can physically hinder the diffusion of LiPSs, as well as chemically adsorb LiPSs by the polar-polar mechanism. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of H-TiOx and PPy layer, the novel cathode delivered high specific capacities at different current rates (1130, 990, 932, 862, and 726 mAh g(-1) at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1C, respectively) and an ultralow capacity decay of 0.0406% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1C. This work can not only indicate effectiveness of employing H-TiOx materials to realize the LiPSs immobilization but also shed light on the feasibility of combining different materials to achieve the multifunctional sulfur hosts for advanced Li-S batteries.

Herein, four hollow cubic materials with two kinds of nitrogen-doped carbon derived from Prussian blue analogues (PBA) precursor, Co9S8/MnS/NC@NC-400, CoS2/MnS/NC@NC-500, CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 and CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-700, are reported when the vulcanization temperatures are regulated at 400 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C, respectively. Among them, Co9S8/MnS/NC@NC-400, CoS2/MnS/ NC@NC-500 and CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 have the similar hollow cubic structure, which can physically confine the LiPSs's shuttle, however, the Co vacancies of CoS1.097 in the CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 can promote the rearrangement of surface electrons, which is beneficial to the diffusion of Li+/e-, improving the electrochemical reaction kinetics. As for the CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-700 with the same substance but almost collapsed structure, the CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 can accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur conversion. In the four sulfur-host materials, the CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 not only displays the outstanding adsorption ability on LiPSs, but also presents the best electrocatalytic activity in the Li2S potentiostatic deposition experiments and active sulfur reduction/oxidation conversion reactions, greatly promoting the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries. The S@CoS1.097/MnS/NC@NC-600 cathode can deliver 1010.2 mA h g-1 at 0.5 C and maintain 651.1 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles. In addition, the in-situ X-ray diffraction (in-situ XRD) test reveals that the sulfur conversion mechanism is the processes of the ocS8 -. Li2S -. /3-S8 (first cycle), then /3-S8 M Li2S during the subsequent cycles. Based on the fundamental understanding of the design and preparation of CoxSy/MnS/NC@NC hosts with the desired adsorption and catalysis functions, the work can provide new insights and reveal the defect-engineering to develop the advanced Li-S batteries.

However, dissolution of lithium polysulfides in the liquid electrolyte, low electrical conductivity of sulfur and large volume change during electrochemical cycling are the main technical challenges for practical applications. In this study, a systematic first-principles density functional theory calculation is adopted to understand the interactions between graphene and graphene with oxygen containing functional groups (hydroxyl, epoxy and carboxyl groups) and sulphur (S-8) and long chain lithium polysulfides (Li2S8 and Li2S4). We find the adsorption is dominated by different mechanisms in sulphur and lithium polysulfides, i.e. van der Waals attraction and formation of coordinate covalent Li-O bonds. The adsorption strength is dependent on the inter-layer distance and electron rich functional groups. Through these mechanisms, sulphur and lithium polysulfides can be successfully retained in porous graphene, leading to improved conductivity and charge transfer in the cathode of Li-S batteries.

Reducing the electrolyte amount is critical for the high specific energy of Li-S batteries in practice. However, using lean electrolytes (that is, with a low Electrolyte to Sulfur (E/S) ratio) always leads to a sluggish sulfur reaction kinetics. Herein, a design strategy based on electrostatic attractions between the cations of ionic liquids and the polysulfide anions is proposed to boost the reaction. The positively charged ionic liquid grafted carbon nanofibers can offer a non-contact coulomb force to attract the polysulfides, accelerate the transport of S species for further strong adsorption and therefore improve the reactant kinetics, especially in a lean electrolyte condition. The electrostatic properties are verified by Zeta potential analysis, Kelvin probe force microscopy test and DFT calculation. As a result, it maintains a high stable discharge capacity of 830 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles (sulfur mass loading: 4.0 mg cm(-2); electrolyte/sulfur ratio = 5 mu l mg(-1)) and a capacity up to 845 mAh g(-1) with an extremely challenging E/S ratio of 3.5 mu l mg(-1). This work provides a rational guidance for electrostatic design and a new strategy for the development of lean-electrolyte Li-S batteries.

To develop a high-rate cathode for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, extenuation of the lithium ion diffusion barrier in thick electrodes is potentially straightforward. Here, a phyllosilicate material with a large interlamellar distance is demonstrated in high-rate cathodes as high sulfur loading. The interlayer space (approximate to 1.396 nm) incorporated into a low lithium ion diffusion barrier (0.155 eV) significantly facilitates lithium ion diffusion within the entire sulfur cathode, and gives rise to remarkable nearly sulfur loading-independent cell performances. When combined with 80% sulfur contents, the electrodes achieve a high capacity of 865 mAh g(-1) at 1 mA cm(-2) and a retention of 345 mAh g(-1) at a high discharging/charging rate of 15 mA cm(-2), with a sulfur loading up to 4 mg. This strategy represents a major advance in high-rate Li-S batteries via the construction of fast ions transfer paths toward real-life applications, and contributes to the research community for the fundamental mechanism study of loading-independent electrode systems.

Based on this substrate, a polyaniline (PANi)-coated activated carbon aerogel/sulfur (ACA-500-S@PANi) composite is prepared via a simple two-step procedure, including melt-infiltration of sublimed sulfur into ACA-500, followed by an in situ polymerization of aniline on the surface of ACA-500-S composite. The obtained ACA-500-S@PANi composite delivers a high reversible capacity up to 1208 mAh g(-1) at 0. 2C and maintains 542 mAh g(-1) even at a high rate (3C). Furthermore, this composite exhibits a discharge capacity of 926 mAh g(-1) at the initial cycle and 615 mAh g(-1) after 700 cycles at 1C rate, revealing an extremely low capacity decay rate (0.48% per cycle). The excellent electrochemical performance of ACA-500-S@PANi can be attributed to the synergistic effect of hierarchical porous nanonetwork structure and PANi coating. Activated carbon aerogels with high surface area and unique three-dimensional (3D) interconnected hierarchical porous structure offer an efficient conductive network for sulfur, and a highly conductive PANi-coating layer further enhances conductivity of the electrode and prevents the dissolution of polysulfide species.

Here, we propose a multifunctional structural battery platform by deploying electrodeposition-like reactions to prepare for conformally-coated electrodes, together with carbon fabrics as the skeleton to endow them with mechanical robustness. As a proof of concept, the Li/S battery system based on the electrodepositionlike mechanism was introduced into the structural batteries for the first time. The Young's modulus of optimized sulfur and lithium electrodes reach 9.2 +/- 1.2 GPa and 4.5 +/- 0.6 GPa, respectively, 5-20 times higher than conventional electrodes. Additionally, a thermally stable composite separator combining boron nitride nanofiller with PVdF polymer (BN/PVdF) is rationally designed, which possesses high compressive strength over 180 MPa. The structural cell integrated with these structural components delivered an excellent lifespan under compression up to 20 MPa for 20 cycles at 0.2 C. Moreover, the structural Li/S cell in pouch configuration displays better resistance to mechanical deformation when compared to the regular Li/S cell. This work provides valuable insight into structural batteries with high energy density.

Herein, a carbon matrix (GO-PEG) consisting of a lithium ion conductor (PEG) is synthesized by grafting PEG onto the surface of graphene oxide (GO) via an esterification reaction. Sulfur is in situ precipitated onto the surface of GO-PEG to form GO-PEG@ C/S cathode materials in a one-pot reaction. The GO-PEG@ C/S cathode materials show uniform distribution of sulfur nanoparticles on ionically and electrically conductive nanosheets. When the cathode is fabricated into an all-solid-state lithium-sulfur battery with a solid polymer electrolyte, the battery exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1225 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C (80 degrees C) and good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 86.6% after 100 discharge-charge cycles at 2C and 80 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the introduction of a lithium ion conductor into the matrix skeleton of the sulfur cathode can enhance the comprehensive electrochemical properties of all-solid-state Li-S batteries.

Exploration of microporous bio-carbon scaffold for efficient utilization of sulfur in lithium-sulfur system	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Coir pith carbon; Bio-waste derived carbon; Microporous carbon; Bio-scaffold for sulfur cathode; Lithium sulfur batteries	GRAPHENE-BASED NANOSHEETS; RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM; ACTIVATED CARBONS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; KOH ACTIVATION; POROUS CARBON; BATTERIES; CHALLENGES; NANOTUBES; COMPOSITE	Coir pith, a sustainable and renewable bio-waste material was activated and the porous carbon thus obtained has been explored for the first time as a scaffold for sulfur cathode. Unlike the reported bio-scaffolds, this study demonstrates the possibility of accommodating about 70 wt.% sulfur within the pores of bio-carbon, without leaving any bulk sulfur on the carbon surface. The naturally available lignin and cellulose content of coir pith offers advantages of porogen triggered pore volume of 0.86 cm(3)/g and the Coir pith derived carbon (CPC) is bestowed with an appreciable surface area of 1952 m(2)/g. CPC provides improved electrical conductivity and better confinement of sulfur against dissolution of polysulfides and the required space to admit volume exhalation of the active material, especially when 50 wt.% sulfur is loaded to form CPC/S-50 composite. As a result, CPC/S-50 cathode tolerates 1C rate condition and exhibits a progressive capacity of 695 mAh/g with 95% Coulombic efficiency. The study recommends CPC as yet another potential bio-scaffold for the effective utilisation of sulfur in Li-S system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, existing drawbacks including the shuttling of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), the insulating nature of sulfur and lithium sulfides, and the considerable volume change of the sulfur cathode result in low sulfur utilization and rapid capacity fading. Herein, graphene-based iron-coordinated framework porphyrin (G@POF-Fe) is proposed to fabricate multi-functional separators to retard these obstacles. Benefiting from the superior electrical conductivity of graphene and favorable chemisorption of iron-coordinated porphyrin, the as-obtained G@POF-Fe interlayer can simultaneously facilitate the charge transport, suppress the LiPS shuttling, and buffer the volume expansion. With these advantages, Li-S batteries with the G@POF-Fe interlayers deliver an outstanding rate capability (957 and 830 mA h g(-1) at 1 and 2C, respectively), impressive cycling stability (a high initial capacity of 1065 mA h g(-1), retaining 671 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C), and excellent high-sulfur-loading performance (5.2 mA h cm(-2) with a sulfur loading of 6.54 mg cm(-2) for 250 cycles) even at high current densities. The framework porphyrin serves as a versatile material to precisely regulate electrical conductivity and polysulfide affinity at a molecular lever, which enriches the interface design strategies for high-performance Li-S batteries.

This additive was identified to be an efficient electrolyte additive to suppress the polysulfide shuttling effect existing in the conventional Li-S chemistry. To detect the positive impact of the new additive, oligo (ethylene glycol) functionalized silane was employed as the electrolyte solvent due to its high solvation capability with the lithium polysulfides. The electrochemical results and the SEM data of Li-S battery using the new electrolyte confirmed the role of the LiDFOB as a critical component to eliminate the shuttling of the dissolved polysulfides thus enabling a high coulombic efficiency.

Sulfur/porous graphitic carbon composites with ultra high sulfur loading of 88.9 wt % (88.9%S/PC) and lower sulfur loading of 60.8 wt % (60.8%S/PC) are both synthesized by a simple melt-diffusion strategy, and served as cathode of rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries. In comparison with the 60.8%S/PC, the 88.9%S/PC exhibits higher overall discharge capacity of 649.4 mAh g((S-C))(-1), higher capacity retention of 84.6% and better coulombic efficiency of 97.4% after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.1C, which benefits from its remarkable specific capacity with such a high sulfur loading. Moreover, by using BP2000 to replace the conventional acetylene black conductive agent, the 88.9% S/PC can further improve its overall discharge capacity and high rate property. At a high rate of 4C, it can still deliver an overall discharge capacity of 387.2 mAh g((S-C))(-1). The porous structure, high specific surface area, high pore volume and high electronic conductivity that is originated from increased graphitization of the porous graphitic carbon can provide stable electronic and ionic transfer channel for sulfur/porous graphitic carbon composite with ultra high sulfur loading, and are ascribed to the excellent electrochemical performance of the 88.9%S/PC.

However, Li-S batteries undergo complex phase transitions and large volume changes during the charge-discharge process, which greatly decreases the lifetimes of Li-S batteries. Here, we investigate the use of water-based phytic acid-crosslinked supramolecular binders in the sulfur cathode to prolong charge-discharge cycling of Li-S batteries. The supramolecular binder is fabricated with a mixture of phosphorylated soybean protein isolate (P-SPI), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and phytic acid (PA), which is denoted by SPP. Strong adsorption of polysulfides by the SPP binder is verified by using UV-vis spectroscopy with an in situ battery. In the sulfur cathodes, the three-dimensional carbon (3DC) with the specific surface area of 2208 m(2)/g and the total pore volume of 1.64 cm(3)/g is used as sulfur hosts. The high discharge capacity of 932.8 mAh g(-1) is achieved by SPP-based Li-S batteries at a high sulfur loading of 8.9 mg cm(-2) at 0.1C. A discharge capacity at 1C is 629.7 mAh g(-1), with stable cycling over 800 charge-discharge cycles, and a capacity attenuation of only 0.0298% per cycle. The coulombic efficiency remained at 99.7%. The new type of waterbased supramolecular polymer binder has high potential for use in high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

Unfortunately, pristine BC still suffers from awful cycling performance rooted in their limited physical/chemical adsorption ability towards polysulfide. Herein, we proposed to construct Nickel Aluminum Layered Double Hydroxides (NiAl-LDH) fences coated on H3PO4 activated BC (PAB) as an efficient sulfur host. The decorated NiAl-LDH fences could efficiently reinforce both chemical adsorption and physical confinement effects on polysulfides, and render as an electrocatalyst to significantly boost the redox reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the DFT simulation has been employed to illustrate enhanced interaction forces towards polysulfides. As a result, the prepared NiAl@PAB/S cell exhibits an improved performance of 1216.3 mAh g(-1) initially at 0.2C (1C = 1672 mAh g(-1)), excellent cycling stability during 300 cycles at 1 C (0.13% decay rate per cycle), and superior rate capability up to 3 C (614.2 mAh g(-1)). This work provides a cost-efficient and effective method to significantly improve the overall performance of porous-carbon-based Li-S battery cathode. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Exploration on sulfur/acid treatment of sepiolite composite positive electrode material for lithium-sulfur battery	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Sepiolite; Sulfur cathode; Acid treatment; Thermal treatment	DOPED CARBON NANOFIBERS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; CATHODE MATERIALS; HIGH-CAPACITY; ACID; ADSORPTION; KINETICS; ISOTHERM	High energy density battery system is endowed with more complex Lithium sulfur cathode whose electro-chemical redox reaction and phase transition occurred due to multi electron participation. The different mole ratios of sepiolite mixed with sulfur were synthesized by acid cum thermal treatment method. The morphological analysis illustrates that the sepiolite powder is composed of micro fibrous bundles in the range of 1 mu m to 10 mu m. The sorption isotherms indicate that the sieved sepiolite (Sp) and different mole ratio (4, 6 and 8) of sepiolite/sulfur shows a type-IV isotherm of mesoporous material. The S/SvSp (sulfur/sieved sepiolite) composite cathode exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1066 mAh g(-1) and attains a stable capacity of 596 mAh g(-1) during 40 cycles with 97% of efficiency. All the results correlated with the better electrochemical behaviour of electrode and it satisfies the needs of high energy density storage application.

Moreover, Li4Ti5O12 has a good affinity with sulfur for restraining lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by the Ti-S bond in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Interestingly, extra cobalt element is introduced to form Li2CoTi3O8, which not only increases theoretical capacity for LIBs but also enhances the adsorption of sulfur for LSBs. In this paper, Li2CoTi3O8 nanoparticles are synthesized via a sol-gel method. As the anode for LIBs, Li2CoTi3O8 displays a desired specific capacity (335.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)) and a better rate-capability (188.5 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1); no capacity decay over 400 cycles), which is superior to electrochemical performances of the reported same substances. Besides, Li2CoTi3O8 nanoparticles are designed as both the sulfur host material and the modified separator in LSBs for the first time. Under the LCTO-coated separator, the Li2CoTi3O8/S electrode achieves a first capacity of 1048 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and the stable capacity retention (732.7 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles). The enhanced performance of the Li2CoTi3O8 electrode is the result of synergistic effect of dispersed particles and larger contact area for LIBs and LSBs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The polysulfide adsorption and conversion capabilities of the interlayer are evaluated by a static polysulfide adsorption test and an electrochemical conversion test in an FS-SiO2/C-CNEM symmetric cell. The effects of the FS-SiO2/C-CNEM on the electrochemical properties of the lithium-sulfur batteries are studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge cycle tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The FS-SiO2/C-CNEM interlayer significantly improves the specific capacity, long-cycling stability, and self-discharge behavior of the lithium-sulfur batteries. The cell with the FS-SiO2/C-CNEM interlayer has an initial discharge capacity of 1304 mA h g(-1) and retains 934 mA h g(-1) over 50 cycles at 0.1 C, corresponding to a capacity retention of 72% with 100% Coulombic efficiency. The improved properties are attributed to the suppression of the shuttle effect and the high reutilization of the trapped polysulfides. The adsorption/conversion mechanisms of the polysulfides of the FS-SiO2/C-CNEM interlayer are further elucidated from the results of ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis.

With the steady development of sulfur cathodes, the recent revival of research on dendrite-free Li metal anodes offers opportunities to improve the stabilities and safety of Li-S batteries. However, the low capacities and low Li utilizations of current Li anodes hinder the improvement of the energy densities of Li-S batteries. Here, we present a facile approach to fabricate lithiophilic three-dimensional porous current collectors by modifying commercial metal foams with yolk shell structured N-doped porous carbon nanosheets. Benefiting from the structure-based rational design, this current collector is able to generate dendrite-free Li anodes with improved Coulombic efficiencies and life spans, enabling carbon/sulfur cathodes to exhibit significantly enhanced stabilities (e.g., 78.1% of capacity retention after 1400 cycles). More importantly, we successfully constructed a high-areal-capacity Li-S full cell (9.84 mAh cm(-2)) with 82% Li utilization. This work provides a promising route toward high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

However, there are several major challenges including the poor conductivity and large volumetric expansion of sulfur, and the shuttle effect and uncontrollable deposition of lithium polysulfides, which lead to the low sulfur utilization and poor cycle life in practical applications. The fabrication of state-of-the-art separator based on high electrical conductivity of 3D porous carbon is believed to restrain the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and control the deposition of lithium sulfide. Herein, we report a kind of 3D mesporous carbon nanocage (PCN) with a high electrical conductivity as an efficient polysulfide buffer layer on PP separator in Li-S batteries for high sulfur utilization. The extraordinary electrical conductivity of the 3D PCN can promote the transformation reaction of Li2S/sulfur-to-lithium polysulfides between PCN separators and sulfur cathode. During charge/discharge, PCN serves as a buffer layer to redistribute the shuttling back of LiPSs owing to its abundant mesoporous structure. Thereby, Li-S batteries using PCN separator shows an extraordinary initial discharge capacity of 1044 mAh g(-1) which still remains 652 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1C. This is a significantly boost for sulfur utilization compared with that in Li-S batteries using PP separator. In addition, the advanced Li-S batteries with PCN separators reveal a superior areal capacity (2.5 mAh cm(-2)) at a high sulfur loading amount of 7.34 mg cm(-2), showing the potential in practical application.

This porous electronic conductor with 3D structure improved the electrochemical performance of the cathodes by simultaneously increasing porosity of material and changing conductive pathway. Electrochemical test results showed that the discharge specific capacity of S-CNTs/CF positive electrode decreased slightly from initial 1213.6 mAh g((sulfur))(1) to 798.4 mAh g((sulfur))(1) after 55 cycles. Comparing with powder cathode, the electrochemical performance of S-CNTs/CF cell is improved significantly. It proves that establishing a sulfur electrode with stable conductive and high porous structure provide a promising way to improve the cycle life. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The catalytic conversion of LiPSs appears to be a fundamental way of suppressing this. The highly conducive metal nitrides show great potentials as high-performance catalysts, but the presence of a thin surface oxidation layer, which is normal for nanomaterials, restrains the surface electron transfer and catalytic activity. In this study, we demonstrate that the doping of the oxidation layer is an ideal solution to reviving and enhancing the catalytic activity of nitrides. As a proof of concept, sulfur-doping of a titanium nitride (TiN) oxidation layer is presented here, and the Ti-S bonds formed are responsible for transmitting electrons from the conducive TiN matrix thus guaranteeing a high catalytic activity. Interfacing of Ti-S with Ti-O bonds at the atomic level helps realize strong trapping and fast conversion of LiPSs simultaneously. As a result, the specific capacity, rate performance, and cyclic stability are all greatly improved by the interlayer composed of sulfur-doped TiN and graphenes, which indicates a practical avenue for building high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the shuttle effect greatly reduces the battery cycle life and sulfur utilization, which is great deterrent to its practical use. This paper reviews the tremendous efforts that are made to find a remedy for this problem, mostly through physical or chemical confinement of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Intrinsically, this confinement has a relatively limited effect on improving the battery performance because in most cases, the LiPSs are "passively" blocked and cannot be reused. Thus, this strategy becomes less effective with a high sulfur loading and ultralong cycling. A more positive method that not only traps but also increases the subsequent conversion of LiPSs back to lithium sulfides is urgently needed to fundamentally solve the shuttle effect. Here, recent advances on catalytic effects in increasing the rate of conversion of soluble long-chain LiPSs to insoluble short-chain Li2S2/Li2S, and vice versa, are reviewed, and the roles of noble metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, and some metal-free materials in this process are highlighted. Challenges and potential solutions for the design of catalytic cathodes and interlayers in Li-S battery are discussed in detail.

Furthermore, thermal treatment enabled improvement of the electrochemical properties of the materials. To investigate the optimum carbonization temperature for the BMZIFs, we conducted a thermal treatment experiment to explore the role of different temperatures. The sample morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical characterization was examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge tests. Based on these electrochemical experiments, a sample treated at 900 degrees C was found to show excellent electrical conductivity; the initial discharge capacity of a lithium sulfur battery using Co,Zn-C-900@S as the electrode material was determined to be 1100.2 mAh/g at 0.1C.

Nevertheless, the pragmatical application of Li-S battery on a large-scale is obstructed by its short cycle life and low Coulombic efficiencies, originating from the notorious shuttle effect. To resolve this issue, in this manuscript, the reduced graphene oxide@CoSe2 (rGO@CoSe2) is proposed for the first time to revise the part of separators in the Li-S battery to restrain the shuttling of polysulfides with the aid of graphene with physical absorption and CoSe2 particles with strong chemical anchoring of lithium polysulfides. The results indicate that the Li-S battery fabricated with rGO@CoSe2-redevised separator presents high initial discharge capacities of 1180mAhg(-1) at 0.2 C (1C=1675mAhg(-1)) and long cycle stability at 0.5 C with a low capacity decrease rate of 0.0856% per cycle. The proposed approach demonstrates a viable way for practical application of Li-S battery with good electrochemical properties.

The primary challenges in the development of Li-S batteries include the suppression of the polysulfide shuttle effect and maintenance of high sulfur loading. Herein, we report a strategy of strong chemisorption for polysulfides utilizing a chemically activated graphene matrix co-doped with nitrogen and sulfur. The dopant N and S atoms act as electron attracting atoms, leading to the nearby C atoms and causing oxygen functional groups to be polarized and more active for anchoring sulfur and polysulfides. Meanwhile, highly developed defects and edges, as well as the porous structure derived from graphene chemical activation, not only achieve a high sulfur loading in a well dispersed amorphous state, but also serve as polysulfide reservoirs to alleviate the shuttle effect. When applied as cathode hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries, the nitrogen-sulfur co-doped porous graphene architecture exhibited a high specific capacity of 1178 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, 1103 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C, and 984 mA h g(-1) at 1C rate, and excellent cycling stability for 600 cycles with a retained capacity of 780 mA h g(-1) (0.2C).

However, there are still some thorny issues needed to be tackled before realizing their practical applications, including underperformed rate capability and unsatisfactory cycling stability. Herein, we have constructed the checkerboard-like heterostructured CoS2/Co nanoparticle inside porous carbon by the electrochemically-sulfonated reaction of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and used them as sulfur electrocatalyst. Benefiting from this structure advantage, the catalyst can not only promote the chemical adsorption of LiPS, but also acts as promoter to provide coupled electrons to accelerate its redox reaction. Through synergistic enhancement, the checkerboard-like CoS2/Co heterostructure provides a boosted chemical adsorption and accelerated catalytic conversion of LiPS, rendering suppressed shuttle effect and enhanced Li-S kinetics. In addition, the porous carbon carriers offer abundant nanoscale pores to effectively immobilize sulfur and accommodate its volume expansion. Therefore, the CoS2/Co sulfur composites exhibit decent rate capability up to 5C and long-term cycling performance over 500 cycles at 1C with a capacity fading rate below 0.059% per cycle. Moreover, an admirable cyclic stability can also be achieved under raised sulfur loading of 7.13 mg.cm(-2) and low E/S ratio of 4.5 mL.g(-1).

Usually, light-weight and nonpolar carbon materials are used as the hosts of sulfur, however they struggle on the cycle stability and undermine the volumetric energy density of Li-S batteries. Here, heavy NiCo2O4 nanofibers as carbon-free sulfur immobilizers are introduced to fabricate sulfur-based composites. NiCo2O4 can accelerate the catalytic conversion kinetics of soluble intermediate polysulfides by strong chemical interaction, leading to a good cycle stability of sulfur cathodes. Specifically, the S/NiCo2O4 composite presents a high gravimetric capacity of 1125 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C rate with the composite as active material, and a low fading rate of 0.039% per cycle over 1500 cycles at 1 C rate. In particular, the S/NiCo2O4 composite with the high tap density of 1.66 g cm(-3) delivers large volumetric capacity of 1867 mAh cm(-3), almost twice that of the conventional S/carbon composites.

However, the practical application is impeded by the intrinsic insulation of sulfur and the fatal shuttle effect during the (dis)charging process. Herein, we report a strategy to address the drawbacks of Li-S batteries by inserting an interwoven carbon nanotubes/cerium dioxide electrocatalyst inter layer material (CNTs@CeO2) between the sulfur cathode and the separator. In the CNTs@CeO2 composite, the conductive network interwoven by CNTs facilitates electron transportation, and the abundant active sites in CeO2 cavities ensuring the adsorption-catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides as well as the hollow structure of CeO2 is conducive to rapid electrolyte penetration and lithium ion migration. Benefiting from such multifunction, the battery with a CNTs@CeO2 interlayer exhibits superior rate performance, delivering a high discharge specific capacity of 1040.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and 652.5 mAh g(-1) at 4C, respectively. Moreover, the battery shows excellent cycling stability with a capacity decay rate of 0.064% per cycle at 1C over 1000 cycles. These promising results demonstrate the potential application of CeO2-based electrocatalysts for high energy density Li-S batteries. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Conventional methods, however, reduce the ionic conductivity, sacrifice the overall energy density and increase the cost of production. Here, we report a facile synthesis of an acrylate-based hierarchical electrolyte (AHE). This quasi-solid electrolyte is assembled by in-situ gelation of a pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA)-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-based electrospun network. The structural similarity and synergetic compatibility between the electrospun network and GPE provide the AHE an ester-rich robust structure with a high ionic conductivity of 1.02 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) due to the strong uptake ability and the elimination of commercial separator. The S/AHE/Li polymer battery also renders a high rate capability of 645 mAh g(-1) at 3C, while maintaining excellent retention at both high and low current densities (80.3% after 500 cycles at 0.3C and 91.9% after 500 cycles at 3C). First-principle calculations reveal that the reduced shuttle effect can be attributed to a strong polysulfide anchoring ability of ester functional groups, while cell modeling shows that the geometric design effectively suppresses polysulfide flux. This in-situ integrated method opens up an avenue for the future development of solid-state and polysulfide redox flow sulfur-based batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, we report a novel hierarchical hybrid composed of nitrogen-doped porous graphene (NG), reduced fluorographene or graphene fluoride (RFG), and sulfur as a composite cathode in the Li-S batteries. In comparison with sulfur composites based on only either nitrogen-doped porous graphene or pure reduced fluorographene, the hierarchical hybrid of RFG, NG, and sulfur (NG-RFG/S) shows a better reversible capacity and rate capability performance due to a better confinement effect of lithium polysulfides and sulfur. The NG-RFG/S cathode with similar to 63.2% S content exhibits a high discharge capacity of 1120 mA h g(-1) and retains 632 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C. At the higher rate of 0.5C, the cell still maintains a discharge capacity of about 300 mA h g(-1) after 800 cycles, which reveals the great potential of this hybrid cathode for long-cycle-life, high energy density storage applications.

Nevertheless, sluggish redox reaction kinetics and irreversible capacity loss limit its commercial application. Herein, Mo2C-C/Fe3C composite with synergistic effect serving as host material for Li-S batteries is reported. The strong polar chemical adsorption capacity of Mo2C and its synergistic catalytic effect with Fe3C nanoparticles effectively inhibit the shuttle effect and improve the utilization of active substances. Meanwhile, the carbon substrate acts as a conductive network to achieve rapid charge transfer. Mo2C-C/Fe3C electrode material combining high electrical conductivity, valid catalytic activity, and strong polar chemisorption ability exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The Mo2C-C/Fe3C cathode based on Li-S batteries delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1203.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 587.1 mAh g(-1) at 2 C.

How to exert the complete conversion is the linchpin of biomass chemistry that asserts a waste-free biorefinery, therefore, the cascade use of three building blocks in lignocellulose is laid at the core area of a booming direction for the extension of bioproducts. Herein, we report a biorefinering initiated by dilute acid and alkaline hydrogen peroxide for successively upgrading bamboo into xylooligosaccharides (XOS), lignin, glucose and lithium-sulfur cathode. The total yield of XOS (44.9 % of low degree of polymerization, DP 2-6) has accounted for 54.4 wt% of hemicelluloses and 12.16 wt% of the virgin bamboo after dilute acid hydrolysis. To probe into the potential of depolymerizing alkaline H2O2-extracted lignin into aromatics, its molecular structure was fully explored for pointing out that the lignin was comprised generally of beta-aryl ether groups and hydroxyl units. By hydrolyzing hemicelluloses and subsequently extracting lignin, the chief building-blocks can be further valorized from the independent process units. The two-stage pretreatment peeled off amorphous fractions and then ruined compact architecture, which led to the enhancement of cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis from 16.5-89.3%. A nitrogen doping of biochar (CC) from cellulose enzymatic residue was synthesized serving as lithium-sulfur cathode (CC@S) that retained 526 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C with an average coulombic efficiency and capacity decay per cycle being 97.35 % and 0.14 %. The present study delivers a waste-free route that endows the feasibility for reforming biomass to chemicals, biofuels and energy storage devices.

However, their commercial application is greatly hindered by the incompletely used active materials and unsatisfactory cyclability. Herein, a novel well-honeycombed porous graphene framework (3D-G) was developed using a PMMA-sphere-assisted vacuum filtration method, and used as an advanced sulfur host for enhancing Li-S battery performance. The unique well-honeycombed porous graphene framework not only enhances the electronic conductivity of Li-S cathodes, but also provides numerous active sites for sulfur adsorption. Moreover, the ultrafine sulfur uniformly embedded into the well-honeycombed porous graphene framework increases the utilization of active materials. Benefiting from these synergistic features, 3D-G/S cathodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, such as long-cycling stability with a ultra-low capacity fading of 0.099% per cycle over 200 cycles at a high current density, holding great promise for development of practically viable Li-S batteries.

Here, a unique long-range and phosphorus-deficient phosphorene (BP4-x) framework featured with 3D ordered sponge (3DOS) architecture and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedding is developed, which serves as a high-performance sulfur immobilizer and catalytic promoter for polysulfide conversion. The 3DOS architecture comprise ultrathin and large BP nanosheets and the semi-connected nanosheets afford open channels for fast ion/mass transfer. Simultaneously, CNTs embedded within the BP4-x skeleton as a conductive network can improve the conductivity of the materials. The Li-S batteries constructed with these advanced features exhibits an enhanced capacity of 1120.1 mAh g(-1) with a high coulombic efficiency of similar to 99.4%, and great rate capability of 660.1 mAh g(-1) at 4 C. Our study illustrates potential application of a metal-free phosphorene catalyst for high energy storage devices. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, sulfur utilization, cycling stability, and mechanical durability are still not satisfactory for flexible batteries with high sulfur loadings. Herein, we present one type of new freestanding electrode material derived from a thiourea-based covalent organic gel (COG). COG can accommodate high loading of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and sulfur with the concomitant formation of an embedded conductive CNT network. The unique performance of the COG not only facilitates ion transfer and electrolyte infiltration but also effectively confines polysulfides in the internal cavities. These advantages endow the freestanding CNT/S/COG electrodes with high reversible capacity, good rate performance, excellent cycling stability, and superior structural integrity. CNT/S/COG with an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 12.6 mg cm(-2) delivers a high discharging capacity of 13.7 mA h cm(-2) (1097 mA h g(-1)) at 0.1 C; the capacity retention is as high as 83.9% after 100 cycles. Moreover, CNT/S/COG could be processed into foldable pouch cells. This study has demonstrated great potential of COGs for the fabrication of advanced flexible energy storage devices with high energy density and long cycling life.

MoS2 nano sheets was selectively grown vertically (V-MoS2) on the microwave-reduced graphene (rGO) sheets through chemical coupling to construct a self-supporting sulfur cathode with a nano storage-box structure (V-MoS2 as the wall and rGO as the bottom). RGO, which has a high conductivity of 37 S cm(1), greatly accelerates the transfer of electrons from the active sites on the edge of the layer to the solution. The introduction of carbon tubes can connect the abundant pores in the foam and act as a long-range conductive path. The 2D-orthogonal-2D structure maximally exposes the edge active sites of MoS2, and together with graphene form a nano reactor of sulfur, intermediate lithium polysulfides and discharge product Li2S(2). The effective combination of the microstructure confinement of the nano storage-boxes and the efficient synchronous catalytic mechanism of V-MoS2 greatly improves the electrochemical performance of the lithium-sulfur batteries. As a result, the assembled lithium-sulfur battery displays a high initial discharge capacity of 1379 mAh g(1), good cycle stability (86% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.1C) and superior rate performance.

Here, a natural clay mineral (illite/smectite, ISC) and carbon black (C) coated Celgard(@)2400 (ISC/C@Celgard) separator is reported. The separator shows super-electrolyte-philicity and good mechanical stability. The low-cost and eco-friendly ISC with abundant -OH groups can quickly trap a lot of polysulfides by Li-O and Li-S bonding with polysulfides. The ISC/C layer with uniform nanopores can also inhibit polysulfides shuttle by physical shield. Moreover, good electrical conductivity of the ISC/C layer can reactivate the adsorbed polysulfides and thus enhance S utilization. So, the separator endows the Li-S battery with very high initial reversible capacity (1322 mA h g(-1)) at 0.1 C and excellent cycle stability with low capacity decay rate (0.054% per cycle) during 500 cycles at 1.0 C. Furthermore, a very high areal capacity (5.9 mAh cm(-2)) is achieved for the battery composed of the separator and the self-supporting high S loading (8.9 mg cm(-2)) CNT/S cathode at 0.32 mA cm(-2). This study opens the possibility of developing advanced separators using natural clay minerals for highly stable Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Raiss, C; Peppler, K; Janek, J; Adelhelm, P				Raiss, Christine; Peppler, Klaus; Janek, Juergen; Adelhelm, Philipp			Pitfalls in the characterization of sulfur/carbon nanocomposite materials for lithium-sulfur batteries	CARBON			English	Article							CATHODE; CELLS; COMPOSITES; CAPACITY; ENERGY; THERMODYNAMICS; CHEMISTRY; PROGRESS; SHUTTLE; LIQUID	The preparation of sulfur/carbon composite materials for lithium-sulfur batteries is currently a very active research field. Thereto, nanoporous carbon materials are mixed with or infiltrated by sulfur to provide a close contact between both compounds. The characterization of these often complex and on the nanoscale structured composite materials is usually done by vacuum based methods such as nitrogen physisorption or scanning electron microscopy, for example. In this study we show that results from these measurements can be misinterpreted. The reason is the volatility of sulfur that leads to a rapid migration and continuous redistribution effects, especially at low pressures and/or elevated temperatures. For nitrogen physisorption this means that virtually identical isotherms are found for S-8/C samples, irrespective of their pre-treatment, making it impossible to prove intentional nanostructuring by pore filling. Similar effects are found for scanning electron microscopy studies where sulfur migration and contamination of originally sulfur free samples is evidenced in situ. Further evidence is provided by macroscopic experiments combined with elementary analysis. The results show that characterizing the structure of S-8/C composite materials or electrodes is very challenging. In addition, the observed rapid sulfur redistribution might also have important consequences for the performance of practical lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The combination of F-doped PMIA membrane and SiO2-F co-doped PMIA membrane endows the functional separator with exceedingly high electrolyte uptake and retention, greatly prominent thermostability, and prevented shrinkage. Moreover, its strong physical inhibition and chemisorption can also confine polysulfides. Thus, the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries using the prepared membrane presented a high initial discharge capacity of 1274.8 mAh g(-1) and maintained a reversible discharge capacity of 814.8 mAh g(-1) with high Coulombic efficiency of 98.42 % after 600 cycles at 0.5 C. Meanwhile, the cell exhibited small interfacial resistance and excellent rate capacity. The excellent properties were attributed to high ionic conductivity offered by the large pore volume of unique 3D nanofiber network, excellent liquid electrolyte uptake of SiO2-F co-doped PMIA membrane, and less "shuttle effect" suppressed by both the physical inhibition of polysulfides by the formed gel polymer electrolyte based on F-doped PMIA membrane and chemical confinement of polysulfides by the addition of F and SiO2. The results indicated that the composite separator through the inexpensive, unsophisticated, and efficient preparation method can provide a good choice for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The cell potential profiles predicted from numerical analysis were compared with experimental discharge and charge curves with emphasis on the possibility of the presence of the intermediate solid phase Li2S2(s). Numerical results suggest that the cell potential obtained without the consideration of the intermediate solid phase Li2S2(s) is in the best agreement with experimental results. Also, the polysulfide shuttling phenomenon has been numerically analyzed with electrolytes of different polysulfide solubility and compared with experimental cell discharge and charge curves. Our model clearly shows that the electrolyte of high polysulfide solubility and unprotected negative (anode) electrode can lead to unwanted reduction reactions of high-order polysulfides on the Li electrode, resulting in a significant overcharge problem. This agrees well with our experimental results for identical experimental conditions. Furthermore, the cycling performance of a Li/S cell was predicted, including the effect of the polysulfide shuttle on the subsequent discharge/charge curves. In the simulation, it was found that the high voltage plateau is reduced markedly in the discharge process after incomplete charge because sulfur (S-8) could not be recovered when the polysulfide shuttle problem is significant. Also, it is suggested that cycling performance of Li/S cells would be improved by limiting both the polysulfide diffusivity and the reduction reaction rate of high-order polysulfides at Li electrode during charge.

However, issues such as lithium dendrites and the shuttle effect severely hampered the large-scale application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel bifunctional gel polymer electrolyte, poly(N,N-diallyl-N, N-dimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonylimide))-P(VDF-HFP) (PDDA-TFSI-P(VDF-HFP), PTP), was prepared by anion exchange reaction to tackle the above problems. Benefited from the interaction between TFSI- and quaternary ammonium ion in PTP, a higher lithium-ion transference number was obtained, which could availably protect Li metal anodes. Meanwhile, due to the adsorption interactions between PDDA-TFSI and polysulfides (LiPSs), the shuttle effect of Li-S batteries could be alleviated effectively. Consequently, the Li symmetric batteries assembled with PTP cycled more than 1000 h and lithium metal anodes were protected effectively. Li-S batteries assembled with this polymer electrolyte show a discharge specific capacity of 813 mA center dot h/g after 200 cycles and 467 mA center dot h/g at 3C, exhibiting excellent cycling stability and C-rates performance.

A variety of carbonaceous materials have been investigated to ameliorate these problems by providing a conductive matrix with physical trapping and chemical binding capabilities, but inevitably resulted in typically low sulfur content in the cathode and hence low gross specific energy when considering all the active and inactive masses. A highly conductive and crosslinked matrix with superior trapping and binding capability to sulfur species but a very low mass density is essential. Herein, crosslinked carbon nanofiber aerogel (CNFA) with extremely low density, attained from pyrolysis of bacterial cellulose (BC) aerogel, was studied for sulfur cathodes. With its unique combination of several merits, in particular the capability of strong absorption of catholyte, CNFA based sulfur electrodes exhibit outstanding performance. With 75% sulfur content of the gross cathode mass, cells demonstrated an initial capacity of 1360 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, and exhibited excellent cycling stability with 76% of the initial capacity retained after 200 cycles.

Yeast cells, as a natural biotemplate, are self-duplicable, nitrogen-rich, inexpensive and regular in morphology. Yeast cells show promising applications in the synthesis of nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon materials for energy storage and transition systems. In this work, we have developed a green and facile self-templating route through low-cost and renewable yeast cells with hollow structures to fabricate N-doped hollow porous carbon microspheres (NHPCMs) for encapsulating sulfur. The sulfur-loaded NHPCM (NHPCM@S) composite with 65 wt% sulfur is then used as the cathode material for Li-S batteries. These batteries exhibit a reversible specific capacity of 1202 mA h g(-1) and a capacity retention of 725 mA h g(-1) over 400 cycles at 0.1C with a capacity decay of 0.09% per cycle, as well as an enhanced rate performance of 587 mA h g(-1) at 2C. In the NHPCM@S composite, the stable micro/mesoporous carbon shell acts as an efficient reservoir for soluble polysulfide, and the doped nitrogen in the carbon shell can offer exceptional electronic conductivity and strong adsorption for polysulfide species. This work demonstrates that an environmentally friendly, economical, sustainable, and self-templating route for N-doped hollow porous microspheres with natural and reproducible biological resources can lead to exciting developments in Li-S batteries and their practical applications in portable electronic devices, advanced electric vehicles, and energy storage systems.

However, the full commercialization of Li-S batteries is still hindered by dramatic capacity fading resulting from the notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides. Herein, we first describe the development of a facile, inexpensive, and high-producing strategy for the fabrication of N-, O-, and S-tri-doped porous carbon (NOSPC) via pyrolysis of natural wheat straw, followed by KOH activation. The as-obtained NOSPC shows characteristic features of a highly porous carbon frame, ultrahigh specific surface area (3101.8 m(2)g(-1)), large pore volume (1.92 cm(3)g(-1)), good electrical conductivity, and in situ nitrogen (1.36 at %), oxygen (7.43 at %), and sulfur (0.7 at %) tri-doping. The NOSPC is afterwards selected to fabricate the NOSPC-sulfur (NOSPC/S) composite for the Li-S batteries cathode material. The as-prepared NOSPC/S cathode delivers a large initial discharge capacity (1049.2 mAhg(-1) at 0.2 C), good cycling stability (retains a reversible capacity of 454.7 mAhg(-1) over 500 cycles at 1 C with a low capacity decay of 0.088% per cycle), and superior rate performance (619.2 mAhg(-1) at 2 C). The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of structural restriction and multidimensional chemical adsorptions for cooperatively repressing the polysulfides shuttle.

In this work, we developed hollow mesoporous MnO2 spheres as efficient host materials for the lithium-sulfur batteries. Due to the presence of the polar MnO2, the shuttle effect of the soluble polysulfide can be greatly inhibited. As a result, the as-prepared HMOs/S composites exhibited superior cycle stability, demonstrating excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, owing to the improved electronic conductivity, the HMOs/S composites showed much higher specific capacity than the pristine sulfur electrode.

To achieve the high volumetric energy density of battery, much attention should be paid to the sulfur cathode. Herein, we introduce heavy lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) nanofibers as sulfur host to enhance the volumetric capacity of cathode, maintaining the high gravimetric capacity simutaneously. With the high tap density of 2.26 g cm(-3), LiCoO2 nanofibers can be used to fabricate a really compact sulfur cathode, with a density and porosity of 0.85 g cm(-3) and 61.2%, respectively. More importantly, LiCoO2 nanofibers could act as an efficient electrocatalyst for enhancing the redox kinetics of sulfur species, ensuring the cathode electroactivity and alleviating the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Therefore, a balance between compact structure and high electrochemical activity is obtained for the sulfur cathode. At the sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2), high volumetric and gravimetric capacities of 724 mA h cm(cathode)(-3) and 848 mA h g(cathode)(-1) could be achieved based on the cathode volume and weight, respectively. Moreover, with this efficient S/LiCoO2 cathode, the lithium corrosion by polysulfides is supressed, leading to a more stable lithium anode.

To suppress this effect, a simple way of modifying separator by introducing lithium fluoride (LiF) as a coating layer was developed. Owing to the interaction between LiF and dimethoxymethane (DME, an electrolyte solvent), a dense and viscous sol layer was formed that suppresses PSs passing from the cathode to the anode. The presence of this layer was confirmed by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric/differential thermogravimetric, and scanning electron microscopy. The linear sweep voltammetry test had shown that the LiF-coated separator had a wide electrochemical window above 5 V vs. Li/Li+, and the cell assembled with the LiF-coated separator exhibited an excellent cycling performance with a capacity retention rate of 69.3%. Even without LiNO3 as an electrolyte additive, a high coulombic efficiency of 93% after 200 cycles at 0.2 C was achieved.

Herein, unlike conventional methods of mixing the polar additives with sulfur/carbon composites, melted sulfur mixed with mesocarbon microbeads are used as the electrode and covered with an additive layer of Nb-doped TiO2/graphite composite via two-step blade coating. By doping TiO2 with Nb, electrical and lithium ion conductivity of TiO2 can be increased, thereby enhancing the redox reaction kinetics. Most importantly, chemisorption of lithium polysulfides to Nb-TiO2 can effectively mitigate the shuttle effect, resulting in higher capacity and longer cycle life. The electrode with the Nb-TiO2 additive layer results in a 1st and 100 th cycle specific capacity of 1883 mAh g(-1) and 894 mAh g(-1), respectively, at 0.1 C (1 C=1675 mAh), indicating enhanced electrochemical performance as compared with that of bare lithium-sulfur batteries. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was conducted to investigate the interaction between polysulfides and Nb -TiO2. The results indicate that the Nb-TiO2-layered electrode efficiently traps polysulfides on the cathode and improves the rate capability, cycle performance, and specific capacity.

The ethanol, as the additive, changes the structure of the rGO/g-C3N4 or rGO/g-C3N4/CNT composite from sheet clusters to regular microspheres. In the microspheres, the pores formed by reduced graphene oxide (rGO), g-C3N4, and carbon nanotube (CNT) stacking provide physical confinement for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). In addition, enriched nitrogen (N) atoms of g-C3N4 offer strong chemical adhesion to anchor LiPSs. The dual immobilization mechanism can effectively alleviate the notorious "shuttle effect" of the lithium-sulfur battery. Meanwhile, the cathode with high cyclic stability can be achieved. The rGO/g-C3N4/CNT/S cathode delivers a discharge capacity of 620 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles with a low capacity fading rate of only 0.03% per cycle at 1 C. Even, the cathode shows a retained capacity of 712 mA h g(-1) over 300 cycles with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm(-2)) at 0.2 C.

However, severe shuttle effects, low sulfur conductivity, and especially poor electrode mechanical flexibility restrict sulfur utilization and loading for practical applications. Herein, high-flux, flexible, electrospun fibrous membranes are developed, which succeed in integrating three functional units (cathode, interlayer, and separator) into an efficient composite. This structure helps to eliminate negative interface effects, and effectively drives synergistic boosts to polysulfide confinement, electron transfer, and lithium-ion diffusion. It delivers a high initial capacity of 1501 mA h g(-1) and a discharge capacity of 933 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles, with slow capacity attenuation (0.069% per cycle). Even under high sulfur loading (13.2 mg cm(-2), electrolyte/sulfur ratio = 6 mL g(-1)) or in an alternative folded state, this three-in-one membrane still exhibits high areal capacity (11.4 mA h cm(-2)) and exceptional application performance (powering an array of over 30 light-emitting diodes (LEDs)), highlighting its huge potential in high-energy flexible devices.

Here, based on density functional theory (DFT) computational results and the design concept of efficient, low-cost and environmental friendliness, we report an ultra-thin (similar to 1 nm) Fe3C nanosheets growing on mesoporous carbon (Fe3C-MC) with large specific surface area of 686.9 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 6.52 cm(3) g(-1). Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of two-dimensional Fe3C is revealed according to DFT results. In the Fe3C-MC composite, the mesoporous carbon constructs a conductive network for dispersion of sulfur species, while Fe3C nanosheets play a key role in electronic transmission, LiPSs adsorption and conversion in Li-S batteries. As a result, the Fe3C-MC composite delivers a high initial capacity of 1530 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, and a capacity of 699 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C at a super-high sulfur loading of 9.0 mg cm(-2), meaning a specific area capacity of 6.291 mA h cm(-2). Such sulfur host is expected to accelerate the practical applications of Li-S batteries benefiting from the low-cost and large-scale process.

To resolve these difficulties, we developed modified separators with electrically exploded MoO2@carbon nanotube (MoO2@CNT) nanocomposites. The embedded MoO2 nanoparticles demonstrated strong chemical anchoring properties with polysulfides; meanwhile, a porous CNT scaffold supported suppression of the shuttle effect and acted as an upper current collector. In addition, the mesoporous textural properties of a MoO2@CNT nanocomposite provide a suitable lithium-ion pathway with enhanced ionic conductivity and additional active sites for active sulfur during cycling; finally, a high utilization of sulfur is achieved in a reversible manner. The LSBs using the modified separator with the optimized MoO2@CNT nanocomposite exhibit high discharge capacities of 1067 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles and significant cycling stability at 1 C. Also, an impressive anti-self-discharge feature and improved rate capabilities were achieved through the introduction of a MoO2@CNT nanocomposite. We believe that our approach can be used as a proof-of-concept for further research into effective methods to prepare modified separators with various electrically exploded carbon-metal oxide nanocomposites that can used in high-performance LSBs.

However, the commercial development of lithium-sulfur batteries is restricted by the shuttle action of polysulfides and volumetric expansion of sulfur. Herein, we developed cobalt selenide/carbon cloth composites (CoSe2/CC) as the interlayer. CoSe2 can not only limit the shuttling of polysulfides by Co-S bonds and accelerate the catalytic conversion kinetics of sulfur chemistry, but also increases the electrical conductivity of materials, leading to an excellent cycle stability. As a result, the cell with CoSe2/CC interlayer has a high initial capacity of 1420 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and keeps high-capacity retention of 596 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C rate (70 %). Subsequent electrochemical tests show that CoSe2/CC enhance the electrochemical behavior of the polysulfides. Therefore, the hierarchical CoSe2/CC composites have promising application potential in lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the shuttling effect caused by the dissolution of polysulfides seriously degrades their electrochemical performance. In this paper, Mn2O3 microcubes are fabricated to serve as the sulfur host, on top of which Al2O3 layers of 2 nm in thickness are deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form Mn2O3/S (MOS) @Al2O3 composite electrodes. The MOS@Al2O3 electrode delivers an excellent initial capacity of 1012.1 mAh g(-1) and a capacity retention of 78.6% after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, and its coulombic efficiency reaches nearly 99%, giving rise to much better performance than the neat MOS electrode. These findings demonstrate the double confinement effect of the composite electrode in that both the porous Mn2O3 structure and the atomic Al2O3 layer serve as the spacious host and the protection layer of sulfur active materials, respectively, for significantly improved electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery.

In this work, based on first principles computations, we explored transition metal embedded C2N monolayers (M@C2N, M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) as host materials and catalysts for Li-S batteries. Our results show that M@C2N monolayers could prevent the LiPSs shuttling with strong adsorption energies towards LiPSs, due to the synergistic effect of M-S and Li-N bonds. Moreover, the presence of transition metal atoms in the C2N could improve its electric conductivity. On the whole lithiation process, all the adsorbed systems are still conductive, which is helpful to boost the sulfur utilization. Importantly, M@C2N monolayers could promote the Li2S decomposition and thus enhance the oxidation kinetics of Li2S back to sulfur. Among them, Co@C2N monolayer is the best host material, which possesses the largest adsorption energies with LiPSs and the lowest decomposition energy of Li2S. This work opens a new avenue for the development of host materials with excellent catalytic activity towards LiPSs, and also sheds light on M@C2N as superior cathode materials.

Herein, a hierarchical mesoporous heteroatom-doped carbon (HMHC) including N, O, S has been fabricated using industrial waste bitumen as carbon source. This HMHC possesses high pore volume, excellent electronic conductivity, strong adsorption of lithium polysulfides and remarkable electrocatalytic effects. This HMHC as sulfur host efficiently suppresses polysulfide shuttle and improves the kinetics of electrochemical reaction. The resultant Li-S batteries with low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 8 mu L mg(-1) show outstanding electrochemical performance with high initial discharge specific capacity of 1100.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and excellent capacity retention of 91% after 200 cycles. This study provides a facile method to fabricate hierarchical mesoporous heteroatom-doped carbon materials to tackle the problem of polysulfide shuttle in Li-S batteries.

However, the sluggish reaction during the decomposition of lithium sulfide results in a low specific capacity and poor cycling stability. Herein Co3O4 nano-particle embedded mesoporous carbon rod (Co3O4@MCR) was prepared through a template method to accommodate sulfur as cathode of lithium-sulfur battery. The resultant composite was characterized by Raman spectra, XRD, TEM, SEM, etc. The electrochemical investigation demonstrated that Co3O4@MCR composite exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic performance in lithium-sulfur battery, which was confirmed by cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge-discharge testing, and study of sulfide oxidation using linear sweep voltammetry. With the current density of 0.2 A/g, the specific discharge capacity can be achieved up to more than 1000 mAh/g after 100 cycles. The enhanced electrocatalytic conversion from Co3O4@MCR leads to a low over-potential, fast lithium-ion kinetics and sulfide oxidation reaction.

However, the G/CNT hybrids that have been fabricated differ greatly from the proposed G/SWCNT hybrids because either the covalent C-C bonding is not well constructed or only multiwalled CNTs/carbon nanofibers rather than SWCNTs are available in the hybrids. Herein, a novel G/SWCNT hybrid was successfully fabricated by a facile catalytic growth on layered double hydroxide (LDH) at a high temperature over 950 degrees C. The thermally stable Fe nanoparticles and the uniform structure of the calcined LDH flakes are essential for the simultaneously catalytic deposition of SWCNTs and graphene. The SWCNTs and the CVD-grown graphene, as well as the robust connection between the SWCNTs and graphene, facilitated the construction of a high electrical conductive pathway. The internal spaces between the two stacked graphene layers and among SWCNTs offer room for sulfur storage. Therefore, the as obtained G/SWCNT-S cathode exhibited excellent performance in Li-S batteries with a capacity as high as 650 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles even at a high current rate of 5 C. Such a novel G/SWCNT hybrid can serve not only as a prototype to shed light on the chemical principle of G/CNT synthesis but also as a platform for their further applications in the area of nanocomposites, heterogeneous catalysis, drug delivery, electrochemical energy storage, and so on.

However, the doping interface as a key chemically active site still lacks in-depth understanding owing to the difficulty in design at the molecular scale. Herein, the BOC network derived from covalent organic framework (COF) is prepared on the surface of CNTs via rational design of the organic condensation reaction. This strategy enables boron and oxygen heteroatoms to be uniformly doped throughout porous carbon because of the uniformly-distributed two elements in the COF precursor. Thereby, the BOC matrix is demonstrated to play a pivotal role in promoting the chemical absorption of polysulfides and enhancing cycling stability. The BOC@CNT with 68.5% sulfur shows superior lithium polysulfides absorptivity and displays superior electrochemical performances as a cathode for Li-S batteries, including a large reversible capacity (1077 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C), and outstanding cycling stability (794 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C). The demonstrated strategy for fabricating BOC network by COF precursor for Li-S batteries provides a new approach to rationally design uniform heteroatom interfaces for good electrochemical performances.

However, rapid capacity decay caused by lithium polysulfide shuttle during charging/discharging processes hinder its practical application. In this work, we demonstrate a cellulose encapsulated carbon/sulfur core-shell structure for advanced Li-S batteries based on electrostatic spinning with coaxial spinnerets. Cellulose serves as an excellent "shell" due to its good ion conductivity, flexible structure to accommodate volumetric expansion of sulfur, and strong capability to prevent sulfur and its intermediate reaction products from dissolving into the electrolyte. CMK-3 mesoporous carbon in the core is helpful to confine sulfur in the pores, and improve the electrical conductivity of the fiber electrode together with the carbon black particles on the outside of the fiber. As a result, the obtained cellulose based flexible sulfur electrode delivers a high initial discharge capacity (> 1200 mA h g(-1)), good electrochemical performance with Coulombic efficiency above 99%, and a low capacity decay rate of similar to 0.12% per cycle over 300 charging/discharging cycles.

A hierarchical microporous. mesoporous carbon (HMMC) with a large surface area and pore volume was prepared by the simple one. step carbonization of a mixture of magnesium gluconate (MG) and phenolic resin. The MG was transformed into nanosize magnesium oxide that acted as a hard template during carbonization to create mesopores. The HMMC has a high surface area (similar to 1 560 m(2) . g(-1)) and large pore volume (similar to 2. 6 cm(3) . g(-1)), which provides abundant space for sulfur loading and accommodates volume changes during charge/discharge. The interconnected pore structure and carbon framework ensure fast electron and Li ion transfer. As the cathode of a Li. S battery the sulfur. loaded HMMC has a high discharge capacity of 939 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0. 3 C and a re. versible capacity of 731 mAh . g(-1) after 150 cycles with only a 0. 15% capacity fade per cycle. Even at a high rate of 2 C, it still de. livers a high discharge capacity of 626 mAh . g(-1), showing an excellent rate performance.

The prepared composites was used as high capacity and stable cycling performance cathode for lithium sulfur battery. It delivers a specific capacity of 1210mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a constant current density of 120mA g(-1). In addition, it remains 989 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at a current density of 300mA g(-1) with ultralow capacity fading of 0.025% per cycle. Meantime, the S0.87Se0.13/CPAN cathode exhibits extremely low self-discharge behavior. The superior electrochemical performance of S(0.87)Se(0.13)n/CPAN composites should be ascribed to high S/Se ratio in S0.87Se0.13/CPAN composites and good conductivity brought by the addition of Se, which make full use of high capacity of S. Moreover, the chemical bonding between Se and S, as well as the chemical bonding between S0.87Se0.13 and CPAN decrease the loss of active material. This easy one-step synthesis procedure offers a feasible new route for the development of sulfide-based cathode material. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This work reports a single-step and facile synthetic strategy for fabricating uniform, micro- and mesoporous, nitrogen-sulfur co-doped carbon nanosheets anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (denoted as CNS@rGO). The composite was prepared by polymerizing m-aminobenzene sulfonic acid on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) and subsequent carbonization. The obtained CNS@rGO contains uniform micro- and mesopores for better sulfur loading and further accommodation of the discharged polysulfides. Such a free-standing electrode exhibits a stable specific capacity of 1355 mA h/g at 0.1 C (100 mA g(-1)) and good rate performance. CNS@rGO shows promising characteristics as a high-performance cathode material for Li-S batteries. Furthermore, even at a high current density of 1 C (1 A g(-1)), it exhibits high storage with a capacity of 476 mA h g(-1) over 300 cycles with a decay of 16.8%, which outperforms all previously reported carbon-based materials for Li-S batteries.

In this work, a thin and light interlayer constructed by boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanofibers (BNCNF) has been produced by a facile electrospinning method with following thermal treatment. Through introducing BNCNF film between cathode and separator, the charge transfer resistance decreases largely and the shuttle effect remits to a great extent. The BNCNF exhibits excellent absorption ability for polysulfides under the role of the B center dot center dot center dot S and N center dot center dot center dot Li chemical interaction, and especially the formation of N=B/N-B structure in the carbon nanofiber framework reinforces the electropositive interaction between B atoms and S-x(2-) and the electronegative interaction between N atoms and Li+ cation, simultaneously. The capacity and cycling life of Li-S batteries are improved significantly due to the BNCNF interlayer. The cell with BNCNF interlayer delivered an initial capacity of 1054.7 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C over 1000 cycles with a decay rate of 0.058%. And even at high current density of 5.0 C, it had an initial capacity of 612.2 mAh g(-1) over 600 cycles with a decay rate of 0.085%. The BNCNF interlayer developed here provides a promising methodology to enhance the performance of Li-S batteries.

The synthesized composites were characterized and examined by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical methods such as galvanostatic charge/discharge, rate performance, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests. The obtained HCNF@TiO2-S composite showed a clear core-shell structure with TiO2 nanoparticles coating the surface of the HCNF and sulfur homogeneously distributed in the coating layer. The HCNF@TiO2-S composite exhibited much better electrochemical performance than the HCNF-S composite, which delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1040mAhg(-1) and maintained 650mAhg(-1) after 200cycles at a 0.5C rate. The improvements of electrochemical performances might be attributed to the unique hybrid nanostructure of HCNF@TiO2 and good dispersion of sulfur in the HCNF@TiO2-S composite.

The Ksp/S was further heat treated at 159 degrees C and then coated by polyaniline (PANI) to fabricate Ksp/S-159 and Ksp/S-159/PANI composites, respectively. The heat treated binary sulfur/carbon and PANI coated ternary sulfur complex showed enhanced cycle performance and rate capability. However, the electrochemical behavior of Ksp/S-159 and Ksp/S-159/PANI can be greatly affected by the discharge current. The Ksp/S-159/PANI composite delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1202.3 mAh g (1) and keeps 954 mAh g (1) after 100cycles at 0.5 mA cm (2) ( 0.31C). The Ksp/S-159 presented a maximum capacity up to 892.5 mA h g (1) at 2 ma cm (2) (1.26C) and retained about 409.2 mA h g (1) after 500 cycles. The PANI coated ternary sulfur complex shows good electrochemical performance at low discharge current while the heat treated sulfur/carbon shows good rate capability at high discharge current.

A reduced graphene oxide@sulfur nanocomposite as a high-capacity host matrix for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIAL; LONG-LIFE; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; HYBRID; CELLS	Nanosheets of reduced graphene oxide are a promising cathode material for achieving advanced Li/S batteries with high energy density and high performance. Herein, we report a procedure to synthesize a reduced graphene oxide (RGO) conductive matrix for trapping nanosulfur particles and polysulfide intermediates that impede sulfur from depositing onto the external surface of the carbon wall. The obtained results demonstrated high specific capacities and good cycling stability of the proposed cathode. The RGO@S cathode renders the discharge capacities of 1131.5, 991.45, 799.23, 765.2, and 645.76 mA h g(-1) at the different current rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2C, respectively. Moreover, high specific discharge capacity of about 593.2 mA h g(-1) was delivered at a rate of 1C after 300 cycles of charge/discharge process with a reduced capacity of about 22.5%. As explained, the RGO@S structure has high potential as a cathode of next generation of lithium-sulfur batteries with high energy and power density.	[Sovizi, M.

Herein, a functional composite interlayer consisting of metallic 1T-MoS2 with high catalytic activity and carbon fiber cloth is firstly designed and fabricated for high-performance Li-S batteries. The 1T-MoS2@carbon fiber cloth (1T-MoS2@CFC) composite interlayer with high electrical conductivity not only serves as the upper current collector to improve the utilization of the sulfur cathode, but also acts as a polysulfide barrier and trapper to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides by strong chemical interaction.

The addition of a small amount of glucose during carbonization improved the yield of carbon, and the inherent N contents, especially for pyrrolic N and pyridinic N atoms. After loading 40 wt.% sulfur, the CNHPC/S composite, as a cathode in a Li-S battery, exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1617 mAh g(-1) (96.5% of theoretical capacity) at 0.1C and a capacity loss of 0.05% per charge-discharge cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5C with a stable Coulombic efficiency of 100% in carbonate based electrolyte. Such a great performance can be attributed to the coralline-like hierarchically porous infrastructure and inherently abundant N doping. Given the conversion of waste pollutants into valuable energy-storage materials and the easy process, this work features a promising approach to prepare C/S cathodes for Li-S batteries. The special structural and textural characteristics of CNHPC might be attractive to other practical applications such as supercapacitors and catalysis.

Here we report a lithium-sulfur battery with ultrahigh sulfur loading and excellent cycling stability using porous graphitic carbon (PGC) as a high-conductivity carrier of sulfur and carbon fiber with crisscross conductive framework as an electric attachment site of sulfur. PGC is fabricated through a simple and environmentally friendly synthesis process involving high-temperature graphitization in a N-2 atmosphere followed by an annealing process in air. Due to the presence of porous graphitic structure, with C-O termination groups, PGC endows the lithium-sulfur battery system with excellent cycling performance. The lithium-sulfur battery cathode constructed by PGC with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2) still retains a high specific capacity of 734.4 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. Meanwhile, an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 12.8 mg cm(-2) for a CR2025 coin cell is achieved, which is the highest sulfur loading reported in the literature for the coin cell. The ultrahigh sulfur loading cell also shows good electrochemical properties, profiting from the mesopores terminated with C-O groups, high specific surface area of 1129.9 m(2) g(-1) and high-conductivity graphitic structure.

However, the poor electrical conductivity, significant volume expansion during discharging, and "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) have seriously impeded the further development of LSBs. Herein, inspired by the "lotus blooming" procedure, a 3D composite host material made up of cobalt nanocrystals/carbon nanosheets/carbon nanotubes (Co/CNS/CNT) is synthesized by in situ growth of CNTs to exfoliate off ultrathin CNSs from 0D precursors in a one-step method. As expected, the 3D structure of Co/CNS/CNT provides horizontal and vertical transmission channels for electrons/ions and is conducive to the uniform loading of sulfur and infiltration of the electrolyte. Furthermore, the Co/CNS/CNT host material realizes the synergistic effect of physical and chemical adsorption/catalysis through its 3D structure and fine Co nanocrystals. The Co/CNS/CNT-S cathode shows excellent cycle performance (after 500 cycles at a current density of 1C, the remaining capacity is 660.6 mAh g(-1), and the capacity decay rate per cycle is only 0.06%). This work achieves the transformation of 0D precursors into a 3D framework through a facile strategy, which has great application potential in LSBs.

The PS/G composites are self-supporting, bendable, and compressible, and can be easily compressed into a sheet of binder-free LiS cathode. The PS/G cathode with an extremely high cathode sulfur density of 1.8 g cm(-3) (active materials content of 80%) delivers an excellent specific capacity of 959 mA h g(-1), an areal capacity of 5.5 mA h cm(-2), and exhibits a low capacity fading rate (0.15% per cycle) within 200 cycles (similar to 60% utilization). Consequently, the electrode gives a corresponding high volumetric capacity of 1726 mA h cm(-3) (the volume is based on all cathode materials plus current collector).

Sulfur/polypyrrole composite cathodes for applications in high energy density lithium-sulfur cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; POLYPYRROLE; PERFORMANCE; BATTERIES; PARTICLES; CAPACITY	Lithium-sulfur cells are quite promising devices for the next generation energy storage applications. However, their specific capacity and cycling stability are adversely affected by poor electrical conductivity of sulfur, shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides and the volume expansion of sulfur during lithium intake. These limitations can be averted through modifying the sulfur cathode by making composites with electrically conducting polymers and carbon nanostructures. The work presented in this paper mainly deals with the modification of sulfur cathode by making composites with polypyrrole, graphene, and polypyrrole/graphene and the investigations carried out to assess their suitability to design Li-S cells with high energy density and good cycling stability.

In this work, biomass-derived porous carbonized pine (p-Cp), abundantly available in Canada, is used as the carbon host for S electrode in the Li-S batteries. A multifunctional composite electrocatalyst zinc sulfide/copper sulfide (ZnS/CuS ZCS) is prepared through a simple chemical reaction involving successive immersion approach. The mesoporous p-Cp efficiently encapsulate the sulfur particles and provides sufficient pore volume to accommodate expansion/contraction of sulfur cathode during the charging-discharging processes. The nanostructured ZCS composite facilitates the liquid-solid phase conversion of lithium poly sulfides (LiPSs) to Li2S to limit the LiPSs dissolution in the electrolyte. Our systematic investigation reveals that the CuS accelerates the electron transfer process while ZnS lowers the energy barrier for LiPSs redox kinetics in the composite electrode. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, the p-CpZCS/sulfur cathode achieves a high specific discharge capacity of about 1457 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.1 C. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Conductive carbon films (CF1) were prepared with filter paper and aluminum (Al) thin films were plated onto the surface of the filter paper by the method of magnetron sputtering to fabricate modified carbon films (CF2). The as-prepared carbon films were applied as conductive interlayers inserted between the cathode and the separator for Li-S batteries S/AC/CF1 and S/AC/CF2. The properties of the cathode materials and the carbon interlayers were characterized by XRD and FESEM. Electrochemical performances of three Li-S batteries with and without interlayers (S/AC/CF1, S/AC/CF2 and S/AC) were determined by alternating-current impedance, cyclic voltammetry and constant-current charge and discharge. The assessment results show that S/AC/CF2 is superior to the others with an initial discharge specific capacity of 1273 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 1C. It delivered a reversible capacity of 924 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles and the coulombic efficiency after 200 cycles is still over 95%.

Herein, a multiple confined cathode architecture is prepared by filling graphitized Pinus sylvestris with carbon nanotubes and defective LaNiO3-x (LNO-V) nanoparticles. The composite electrode with high areal sulfur loading of 11.6 mg cm(-2) shows a high areal specific capacity of 8.5 mAh cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) (0.05 C). Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that this unique structure not only provides physical restriction on LiPSs within microchannels but also offers strong chemical immobilization and catalytic conversion of LiPSs attributed to the spin density around oxygen vacancies of LaNiO3-x. These oxygen vacancies elongate the S-S and Li-S bonds and make them easy to break. Furthermore, the lengthwise channels derived from cytoderm restrict the transverse diffusion of polysulfides, leading to a uniform areal current and thus homogeneous lithium infiltration. This suppresses the corrosion of the lithium anode due to polysulfides confinement. The discovery of the multiple confined structure that provides chemical adsorption, fast diffusion, and catalytic conversion for polysulfides can broaden the application of biomass materials and offer a new strategy to achieve robust Li-S batteries.

Modification of the commercial separator with a functional interlayer is an effective strategy to address this issue. Herein, we modified the commercial Celgard separator of Li-S batteries with one-dimensional (1D) covalent triazine framework (CTF) and a carbon nanotube (CNT) composite as a functional interlayer. The intertwined CTF/CNT can provide a fast lithium ionic/electronic transport pathway and strong adsorption capability towards polysulfides. The Li-S batteries with the CTF/CNT/Celgard separator delivered a high initial capacity of 1314 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and remained at 684 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles(-1) at 1 C. Theoretical calculation and static-adsorption experiments indicated that the triazine ring in the CTF skeleton possessed strong adsorption capability towards polysulfides. The work described here demonstrates the potential for CTF-based permselective membranes as separators in Li-S batteries.

Nevertheless, one of the major problems is the infamous shuttle effect of polysulfides, which causes active material sulfur loss and low Coulombic efficiency. Here, we designed a 3-D configuration electrodes. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes paper (MWCNTsP) was used as the current collector, and MWCNTs film was used as the interlayer (MWCNTsI) between the positive electrode and the separator. The unique configuration retarded the dissolution and dispersion of polysulfides. The electrochemical tests showed that the initial discharge capacity reached 1352 mAh/g and the Coulombic efficiency reached around 100% with the 3-D configuration electrode (MWCNTsP-S@MWCNTsI). The discharge capacity remained 1028 mAh/g after 20 cycles. Additionally, the batteries maintained a specific capacity of 902 mAh/g, 782 mAh/g and 509 mAh/g at the current rate of 1C, 2C and 5C, respectively.

It is found that the elemental sulfur was homogeneously dispersed inside the meso-pores of HNMC based on the analyses. Electrochemical tests reveal that the sulfur-HNMC (53.3 wt% sulfur) composite shows high rate capability and long cycling stability as cathode materials. The sulfur-HNMC (53.3 wt% sulfur) composite cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1209 mAh g(-1)and retains as high as 600 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, the cathode also presents a long term cycling stability up to 300 cycles even at 3 C. The results illustrate that the high rate capability and long term cycling stability of sulfur cathode can be enhanced significantly by encapsulating sulfur into the highly ordered nitrogen-rich mesoporous carbon nanostructure, and the HNMC nanostructure would be a promising carbon matrix for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Modified carbon nanotubes for water-based cathode slurries for lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH			English	Article						C; energy storage; S	GRAPHENE OXIDE; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; NANOCOMPOSITE; POLYSULFIDES; PARTICLES; LI2S	In this study, for the first time, chemically modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were used as a conductive additive in the cathode composite for lithium-sulfur batteries. Oxidation of pure CNTs has been carried out using modified Hummers' method, and to partially remove oxygen groups from the CNT surface and increase their electronic conductivity, oxidized CNTs have been hydrothermally treated. The cathode slurry was mixed in water with a water-soluble LA133 binder. Despite the decrease in electronic conductivity of CNTs after chemical treatment, the presence of structural defects and oxygen groups provides uniform distribution of modified CNTs in the sulfur-based composite, which results in more than twice higher electrode specific capacity compared with the electrodes comprising pure CNTs. Using chemically modified CNTs as a conductive additive is proposed as an effective way for the preparation of nontoxic and cost-effective water-based cathode slurries in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Here, we develop a graphene oxide scaffold/sulfur composite-encapsulated microcapsule (GSM) for high-performance Li-S batteries, which is prepared through the co-flow focusing (CFF) approach. The GSM-based cathode displays a high capacity of 1004 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after cycling 200 times, a long-term cycling stability after 1000 cycles at 2C, and a good rate-performance. At temperatures of -5 degrees C and 45 degrees C, the electrochemical performance is also excellent. The computational calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) verify the high adsorption energies of the microcapsules towards polysulfides, suppressing the shuttle effect efficiently. It is expected that the GSM system developed based on the CFF method here and its high electrochemical performance will enable it to be applicable for preparing many other emerging energy-storage materials and secondary batteries.

For the development of high-performance Li-S batteries, we first time utilize a simple growth method to introduce a Prussian blue (PB)-modified Celgard separator as an ion-selective membrane. The unique structure of PB could effectively suppress the shuttle of polysulfides but scarcely affect the transfer ability of lithium ions, which is beneficial to achieve high sulfur conversion efficiency and capacity retention. The Li-S battery with PB-modified Celgard separator has an average capacity decay of only 0.03% per cycle at 1C after 1000cycles.

Carbon additives help overcome the low electrical conductivity of sulfur. Cathodes were prepared at 30 wt% sulfur on different activated carbons having unloaded BET surface areas of 1200-3200 m(2)/g. Sulfur utilization ranged from 33% to 83% of the theoretical capacity (1672 mAh/g) with a strong correlation to the accessible pore volumes having pore widths between 1 and 5 nm. Additionally, cathodes prepared at 12.5-68 wt% on an activated carbon having unloaded BET surface area of 3200 m(2)/g showed excessive sulfur loading provided little additional capacity.

Regardless of the high concentration of RTIL-Li-salt mixtures with fumed silica nano particles, i.e., 80-90% volume ratio, the composites were white powders. Further blending with 5wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) powder caused the composite powders to become transparent sheets of 30-200 mu m in thickness. The electrolyte sheets exhibited liquid-like high apparent conductivities regardless of their solid-like appearance. Sulfur utilization ratios were enhanced using conductive additives with high specific surface areas. Cells with notable performance were successfully assembled after the optimization of the RTIL solvent composition, electrolyte thickness, and conductive additive species. The initial discharge capacity was 1100 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C. After 45 discharge-charge cycles, the discharge capacity was still 690 mAh g-1. This performance is comparable to lithium-sulfur cells that use the RTIL-Li-salt liquid electrolytes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the soluble property of polysulfides into the electrolyte during charge/discharge process leads to low sulfur utilization, severe polarization and short cyclic life, which has been a serious obstacle for practical application. How to anchor the polysulfides onto the cathode materials and moreover, enhance its further conversion to the final products, have been important challenges for the utilization of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel well crystallized nanosized Fe7S8 possessing of a high specific surface area of 55.6 m(2) g(-1) fabricated by a simple microwave-assisted method combined with high temperature pyrolysis technique, is introduced into the S/C composite cathode for the first time. Strong interaction between polysulfides and the Fe7S8 can be realized to relieve the shuttle effect. The redox reaction of polysulfides can also be promoted to reduce electrode polarization. As a result of the enhanced utilization of sulfur, the optimized S@GFS-15 electrode may deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1307.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA h g(-1)) and low decay rates of 0.047% and 0.037% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1 and 2 C respectively when the sulfur loading is ordinary 1.1 mg cm(-2). Even the sulfur loading rises up to 2.6 mg cm(-2), a large initial discharge specific capacity of 1134.5 mA h g(-1) can be achieved at 0.1 C. After 600 cycles, the specific capacity of 457.3 mA h g(-1) with a relatively small average decay rate of 0.062% per cycle can be obtained. Thus, incorporation of the nanosized Fe7S8 with graphene can help to achieve effective performance improvement route for Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reconstruction of multidimensional carbon hosts with combined OD, 1D and 2D networks for enhanced lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Li-S battery; Energy storage; Multidimensional carbon network; Integrated cathode; Multileveled blocking effect	HIGH-PERFORMANCE; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; CATHODE MATERIALS; COMPOSITE; GRAPHENE; MEMBRANE; INTERLAYER; NANOSHEETS; STABILITY; GROWTH	It is a core task to find solutions to suppress the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides and improve high rate capability at the sulfur cathode of lithium sulfur batteries. Herein we first time propose a concept of multileveled blocking "dams" to suppress the diffusion of polysulfides. We report a facile and effective strategy to construct multidimensional conductive carbon hosts for accommodation of active sulfur. Multidimensional ternary carbon networks (MTCNs) with OD nanospheres, 1D nanotubes and 2D nanoflakes are organically combined together to provide multileveled conductive channels to reserve active sulfur and promote stable sustained reactions. In the light of enhanced conductivity and multi leveled blocking "dams" for polysulfides, the designed MTCN5/S cathode has been demonstrated with noticeable improvement in discharge capacity (1472 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and long-term cycling stability (65% retention at 5.0 C after 500 cycles). Our research may provide a new insight in the gradient blocking of polysulfides with the help of multidimensional carbon networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Li, S. H.; Xia, X.

In this study, the thermally exfoliated large lateral-sized graphene (denoted LTG) was employed as the conductive matrix to support sulfur, and its performance was then compared with that of a smaller lateral-sized graphene (denoted STG) for Li-S batteries. The results showed that the LTG-S composite exhibited much higher capacity retention (53%) versus the STG-S (29%) and better rate capabilities. Because they were both identical in morphology, in terms of sulfur content and sulfur distribution, the improved properties probably resulted from the potential prevention of polysulfide diffusion upon cycling due to the larger graphene-based network and higher aspect ratio of the LTG matrix, referred as better polysulfide reservoirs. To further improve the cell performance, a reduced graphene oxide-coated carbon fiber paper (RCF) was inserted between the LTG-S cathode and the separator by a simple drop-coat method, which provided an increased conductive surface area for polysulfides to be oxidized/reduced and buffered volume expansion. As expected, the discharge capacities of 1143 and 622 mA h g(-1) at first use and after 100th cycles were obtained with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%, which were higher than 847 and 455 mA h g(-1) for the cathode without the RCF, respectively. This study highlights the significance of large graphene sheets and interlayers on the inhibition of polysulfide diffusion and offers a new way to solve the problems of Li-S batteries.

Here, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, the potential applications of the experimentally available SiC2 siligraphene (g-SiC2) as an anchoring material of Li-S batteries are systemically investigated. Our results reveal that g-SiC2 exhibits remarkable but not strong binding strength for the soluble Li2Sn species due to the S-Si and Li-C interactions. Especially, the intactness of the Li2Sn species and the good conductance of g-SiC2 can be well preserved after anchoring the Li2Sn species. The further comparative research demonstrate that g-SiC2 is superior to other siligraphenes, enabling it to be a very promising material as an ideal anchoring material for the immobilization of soluble Li2Sn species to avoid their dissolution into electrolyte.

However, the severe polysulfides shuttling in Li-S battery always causes low Coulombic efficiency, capacity fading, and hindering its practical commercialization. Herein, a dual-functional PEI@MWCNTs-CB/MWCNTs/PP (briefly denoted as PMS) separator is assembled through Langmuir-Blodgett-Scooping (LBS) technique for improvement of Li-S battery performance, that is, rational integrating conductive MWCNTs multilayer on a routine PP separator with polyethyleneimine (PEI) polymer. Owing to "proton-sponge"-based PEI feature with the abundant amino/imine groups and branched structures, the PMS separator can provide strong affinity to immobilize the negatively charged polysulfides via electrostatic interaction. Simultaneously, incorporated with the conductive MWCNTs multilayers for the electron transportation, the Li-S cells assembled with PMS separators achieve exceptional high delivery capacity, good rate performance (similar to 550 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 9 A g(-1)), and stable cycling retention (retention of 84.5% at a current density of 1 A g(-1)) even over 120 cycles, especially in the case of high-loading sulfur cathode (80 wt% of S content). This multifunctional separator with dual-structural architectures via self-assembly LBS method paves new avenues to develop high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, a dissolvable ionic crosslinked polymer (DICP) is exploited as a binder for lithium-sulfur batteries by crosslinking the polyacrylic acid and polyethyleneimine through carboxy-amino ionic interaction. This interaction is pH-controlled, and therefore, the crosslinked binder network can be readily dissociated under basic conditions, providing a facile strategy enabling valuable components recycled through a convenient washing method. The sulfur cathode prepared using the recycled carbon-sulfur composite can deliver comparable capacity as that of fresh electrode. In addition, evidence from cell performance and characterizations, such as in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation, confirms that DICP is a more effective binder than its commercial counterpart on suppressing polysulfide dissolution in the electrolyte. Exploiting reversible crosslinked polymer binder for recyclable Li-S batteries with ameliorated electrochemical performance, this study illuminates sustainable development for large-scale energy storage systems.

Enhancing the redox reaction kinetics, depressing the shuttle effect and the controlled deposition of lithium sulfide are simultaneously in urgent requirement for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Benefiting from the structure, the resulting compound demonstrates exceptional performance with a high discharge capacity of 875 mA h g(-1) at 1C, a prominent rate capability of 550 mA h g(-1) at 6C and remarkable electrochemical performances even with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg cm(-2)).

J	Cai, KP; Song, MK; Cairns, EJ; Zhang, YG				Cai, Kunpeng; Song, Min-Kyu; Cairns, Elton J.; Zhang, Yuegang			Nanostructured Li2S-C Composites as Cathode Material for High-Energy Lithium/Sulfur Batteries	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Energy storage; lithium/sulfur batteries; lithium sulfide (Li2S); cathodes; high specific energy; electrochemical activation	ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; CARBON NANOFIBER; ELECTRODE; ION; CHALLENGES; STORAGE	With a theoretical capacity of 1166 mA.h.g(-1), lithium sulfide (Li2S) has received much attention as a promising cathode material for high specific energy lithium/sulfur cells. However, the insulating nature of Li2S prevents the achievement of high utilization (or high capacity) and good rate capability. Various efforts have been made to ameliorate this problem by improving the contact between Li2S and electronic conductors. In the literature, however, a relatively high capacity was only obtained with the Li2S content below 50 wt %; therefore, the estimated cell specific energy values are often below 350 W.h.kg(-1), which is insufficient to meet the ever-increasing requirements of newly emerging technologies. Here, we report a cost-effective way of preparing nanostructured Li2S-carbon composite cathodes by high-energy dry ball milling of commercially available micrometer-sized Li2S powder together with carbon additives. A simple but effective electrochemical activation process was used to dramatically improve the utilization and reversibility of the Li2S-C electrodes, which was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. We further improved the cycling stability of the Li2S-C electrodes by adding multiwalled carbon nanotubes to the nanocomposites. With a very high specific capacity of 1144 mA.h.g(-1) (98% of the theoretical value) obtained at a high Li2S content (67.5 wt %), the estimated specific energy of our cell was similar to 610 W.h.kg(-1), which is the highest demonstrated so far for the Li/Li2S cells. The cells also maintained good rate capability and improved cycle life. With further improvement in capacity retention, nanostructured Li2S-C composite cathodes may offer a significant opportunity for the development of rechargeable cells with a much higher specific energy.

Toward overcoming these limitations, herein an in situ grown C2N@NbSe2 heterostructure is presented with remarkable specific surface area, as a Li-S catalyst and LiPS absorber. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results comprehensively demonstrate that C2N@NbSe2 is characterized by a suitable electronic structure and charge rearrangement that strongly accelerates the LiPS electrocatalytic conversion. In addition, heterostructured C2N@NbSe2 strongly interacts with LiPS species, confining them at the cathode. As a result, LSBs cathodes based on C2N@NbSe2/S exhibit a high initial capacity of 1545 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. Even more excitingly, C2N@NbSe2/S cathodes are characterized by impressive cycling stability with only 0.012% capacity decay per cycle after 2000 cycles at 3 C. Even at a sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm(-2), a high areal capacity of 5.65 mAh cm(-2) is delivered. These results demonstrate that C2N@NbSe2 heterostructures can act as multifunctional polysulfide mediators to chemically adsorb LiPS, accelerate Li-ion diffusion, chemically catalyze LiPS conversion, and lower the energy barrier for Li2S precipitation/decomposition, realizing the "adsorption-diffusion-conversion" of polysulfides.

To investigate the effect of the pore size and the pore volume of mesoporous carbon on the absorption characteristics of the Li-polysulfides, mesoporous carbons with various pore sizes and total pore volumes were prepared by varying the size and the amount of colloidal silica templates. The results show that mesoporous carbon-containing sulfur cathode enhanced the cyclic performance of the batteries significantly. Comparable performances were observed regardless of pore size, suggesting that the pore size is not a critical factor affecting the absorption characteristics of the Li-polysulfides. However, the cyclic performance was affected by the total pore volume, suggesting that a certain pore volume is necessary to confine the majority of the soluble Li-polysulfides generated during cycling and to enhance sulfur utilization. The novel results obtained in this study will contribute to the consolidation of S electrochemistry and further development of high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N/S-Co-doped Porous Carbon Nanoparticles Serving the Dual Function of Sulfur Host and Separator Coating in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						carbon nanoparticles; porous carbon; nitrogen and sulfur doping; lithium-sulfur battery; sulfur/carbon nanocomposite; polysulfides barrier	PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN; CATHODE; POLYSULFIDES; ACTIVATION; ELECTRODES; MEMBRANE; POROSITY; BIOMASS	Porous carbon nanoparticles (PCNs) co-doped with nitrogen and sulfur have been produced by applying a straightforward template-free method entailing a high-temperature reaction between polypyrrole nanoparticles and sodium thiosulfate. The activation process gives rise to porous carbon nanoparticles that combine several important properties: (a) a uniform size of similar to 80 nm; (b) a well-developed porosity with BET surface areas of up to similar to 1700 m(2) g(-1) and pore volumes of up to 2.20 cm(3)g(-1); (c) a sizable N and S heteroatom content (of up to 2.7% N and 7.7% S), and (d) a good electrical conductivity (up to 3 S cm(-1)). The synthesis strategy offers a great versatility since two types of materials, PCN or S/PCN (nanocomposites comprising elemental sulfur infiltrated into the PCN), can be produced by introducing minor changes to the procedure. These materials have been tested on two components of a lithium-sulfur cell. The S/PCN nanocomposite is used as the cathode, whereas the PCN material is deposited onto the separator to form a thin packed layer in order to restrict the mobility of the polysulfides. Remarkably, the PCN coating layer notably enhances the utilization of sulfur (increase of 23% during the first cycles), and it provides robustness during long-term cycling. The battery assembled with these two components exhibits a highly stable cycling performance from the very first charge-discharge cycles and delivers a reversible capacity of 841 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.3%. Despite using a S/PCN composite with a high sulfur content (>70%), the cell was successfully cycled at 2C over 500 charge-discharge cycles and experienced a capacity decay of only 0.089% per cycle.

However, the "shuttle effect" caused by the dissolution of polysulfides always leads to a rapid loss of capacity. To overcome this issue, we successfully constructed an ultrathin separator (similar to 30 nm) with atomic-confined-space (similar to 1.1 nm) by the assembly of layered double hydroxide nanosheets (LDH NSs) and graphene oxide (GO) on a commercial polypropylene separator. Both the experimental results and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirm that the restricted pathways on the LDH/GO ultrathin film effectively block polysulfides but promote the uniform dispersion of Li ions. The (LDH/GO)(20)-assembled Li-S battery exhibits superior performance with a high initial discharge capacity (1092 mA h g(-1)) and excellent cycle stability (0.08% capacity decay per cycle) at 0.2C. In addition, the developed separator exhibits promising high temperature performance, which is attributed to the use of inorganic LDH and GO NSs. This work shows the promise of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials as efficient functional separators for Li-S batteries.

Herein, a novel carbon foam integrated by hollow carbon bubble nanoreactors with ultrahigh pore volume of 6.9 cm(3).g(-1) is meticulously designed for ultrahigh sulfur content up to 96 wt.%. Tailoring polysulfide trapping and ion/electron transport kinetics during the charge-discharge process can be achieved by adjusting the wall thickness of hollow carbon bubbles. And a further in-depth understanding of electrochemical reaction mechanism for the cathode is impelled by the in-situ Raman spectroscopy. As a result, the as-prepared cathode delivers high specific capacitances of 1,269 and 695 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1 and 5 C, respectively. Furthermore, Li-S pouch cells with high areal sulfur loading of 6.9 mg.cm(-2) yield exceptional practical energy density of 382 Wh.kg(-1) under lean electrolyte of 3.5 mu L.mg(-1), which demonstrates the great potential for realistic high-energy Li-S batteries.

The composite was used as the cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. The SiO2 nanospheres with radial meso-channels provided sufficient internal space to accommodate the volume expansion for sulfur and possessed strong adsorption capability for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Additionally, the thin PANI coating serving as conductive frameworks generated sufficient electrical conduction paths and effectively prevented the outward diffusion of LiPSs, leading to long-term stability. Benefitting from the composites' unique structural and compositional advantages, we obtained an initial specific capacity of 1008.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and an outstanding cycling stability at 1 C rate over 1000 cycles with a capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle. An excellent rate performance of 630.2 mA h g(-1) at 2 C was also achieved. Our work reveals the potential application of the porous SiO2@PANI-based sulfur cathodes in future high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Furthermore, first-principle calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis prove the strong adsorption of LiPSs by the SiO2 surface. The formation of S-O bond on the SiO2 is also found to dominate the adsorption mechanism between LiPSs and SiO2.

However, continuous dissolution of cathodic sulfur and followed shuttle effect of polysulfides lead to very limited service lifetime for currently-applied Li-S batteries. Herein, a 3D porous graphene aerogel (GA) decorated with high exposure of anatase TiO2 (001) nanoplatelets is proposed as robust host to immobilize cathodic sulfur. Compared with commonly used TiO2 (101) nanoparticles, the TiO2 (001) nanoplatelets have highly matched lattices with graphene (002) nanosheets, thus facilitating the electronic transfer. The in-site assembled TiO2@GA host exhibits superior sulfur-immobilized capability, which cannot only entrap sulfur by physical confinement, but also capture dissoluble sulfurous species by chemical bonding. The fabricated S@TiO2@GA cathode shows excellent electrochemical performance with high discharge capacity, superior rate capability, and durable cycling stability as well, supposed to be a promising cathode for high-performance Li-S battery applications.

Here, a novel 3D graphene nanosheet-carbon nanotube (GN-CNT) matrix is obtained through a simple one-pot pyrolysis process. The length and density of CNTs can be readily tuned by altering the additive amount of carbon source (urea). Specifically, CNTs are in situ introduced onto the surface of the graphene nanosheets (GN) and show a stable covalent interaction with GN. Besides, in the GN-CNT matrix, cobalt nanoparticles with different diameters exist as being wrapped in the top of CNTs or scattering on the GN surface, and abundant heteroatoms (N, O) are detected, both of which can help in immobilizing sulfur species. Such a rationally designed 3D GN-CNT matrix makes much more sense in enhancing the electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode for rapid charge transfer and favorable electrolyte infiltration. Moreover, the presence of dispersed cobalt nanoparticles is beneficial for trapping lithium polysulfides by strong chemical interaction, and facilitating the mutual transformation between the high-order polysulfides and low-order ones. As a result, the S/GN-CNT composite presents a high sulfur utilization and large capacity on the basis of the S/GN-CNT composite as active material.

Therefore, exploiting a simple but cost-effective approach for the absorption and conversion of LPS and the transfer of electrons and Li+ ions is of para -mount importance. Herein, sandwich structure MWCNTs@N-doped-C@CoS2 integrated with multiple nanostructures of zero-dimensional (0D) CoS2 nanoparticles, 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and 2D N-doped amorphous carbon layer was obtained, where MWCNTs was firstly uniformly attached with a polydopamine (PDA) of excellent adhesion, followed by hydrothermal method, the Co2+ nanoparticles were in-situ grown on the PDA by the formation of complex compound of Co2+ and N atoms in PDA, and then the CoS2 nanoparticles were in-situ grown on CNTs in a point-surface contact way by a bridging of N-doped amorphous carbon layer derived from the carbonization of attached PDA after the vulcaniza-tion at 500 degrees C under Ar atmosphere. The multifunction synergism of absorption, conductivity, and the kinetics of LPS redox is significantly improved, consequently effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and tremendously increasing the utilization rate of active substance. For the Li-S battery assembled with MWCNTs@N-doped-C@CoS2-modified separator, its rate capacity and cycling performance can be greatly enhanced. It can exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 1590 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, a stable long-term cycling performance with a relatively low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle during 500 cycles at 1 C, and a reversible capacity of 772 mAh g(-1) and a capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle during 250 cycles at 2 C. Even at a large current density of 4 C, an initial specific discharge capacity of 634 mAh g(-1) can still be delivered. With a high sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm(-2), additionally, an outstanding cycling stability can also be well maintained at 685 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C after 50 cycles. This work provides a novel and simple but effective strategy to develop such sandwich hybrid materials comprised of polar metal sulfides and con-ductive networks via an effective bridging to help realize durable and stable Li-S battery.

However, the inferior cycling performance as well as rate capability, resulted from the polysulfides shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics, remains as major hurdles for its practical application. Herein, a high-rate and ultrastable Li-S battery has been demonstrated by using the multifunctional iron phosphide (FeP) nanocrystals as an efficient host material to anchor the polysulfides and regulate the polysulfide redox conversion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that FeP can provide strong chemical bonding towards polysulfides. The FeP nanocrystals show high catalytic effect to facilitate the polysulfides conversion reaction and lower the Li2S nucleation energy. Additionally, the 3D rGO-CNTs scaffold enables fast and continuous long-distance electron transportation and accommodates large volumetric change during the charge/discharge processes. As a result, the FeP nanocrystals with intrinsic polysulfide affinity and catalytic activity suppress the polysulfide dissolution and enhance the redox reaction kinetics, enabling ultrastable cycling (0.04% capacity decay per cycle) and excellent rate performance (613.1 mAh g(-1) at 3 C). Significantly, the enhanced Li-S performances provide significant insight for realizing high performance Li-S batteries by incorporating the metal phosphides into the sulfur cathode.

However, the practical electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries needs to be improved. In this work, a carbon nanofibers-carbon matrix-sulfur composite is synthesized to improve the electrochemical properties of lithium-sulfur batteries. The carbon matrix-sulfur composite is fabricated by deoxidizing the carbon precursor-sulfur composite. Morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of materials have been characterized and tested. Results show that the carbon matrix-sulfur composite envelops carbon nanofibers and sulfur is evenly distributed in the carbon nanofibers-carbon matrix-sulfur composite. In a carbon matrix-sulfur composite, sulfur chemically bonds with the carbon matrix. The chemical bonds form in the process of deoxidizing the carbon precursor-sulfur composite. In a carbon nanofibers-sulfur mixture, sulfur is dispersed on carbon nanofibers. In comparison with a carbon nanofibers-sulfur mixture electrode, the carbon nanofibers-carbon matrix-sulfur composite electrode exhibits higher discharge capacity and cycle stability. The better electrochemical performance is ascribed to the restriction for dissolution of lithium polysulfides through the adsorbability of the carbon matrix.

Herein, we presented a facile no-slurry method to synthesize a three-dimensional polyvinylpyrrolidone-sulfur/graphene aerogel composite, which can be pressed into flexible sheets and directly used as a cathode without any additives. With a superior microstructure and high electrical conductivity, the as prepared cathode enables a high areal sulfur loading of 2.8 mg cm(-2), which delivers an initial gravimetric specific capacity of 1192.6 mA h g(-1) and an areal specific capacity of 3.34 mA h cm(-2) at 0.1C. After the first few cycles and stabilization, the cathode exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 94.6% from the 10th to 50th cycle, together with a great rate capability and cycling stability for 200 cycles at 0.5C. Moreover, this no-slurry method is convenient to be integrated with other composites, which has the potential to further improve the performances of lithium-sulfur batteries and simplify the preparation process.

Here, we report a rationally designed Li-S cathode with a dual-confined configuration formed by confining sulfur in 2D carbon nanosheets with an abundant porous structure followed by 3D graphene aerogel wrapping. The porous carbon nanosheets act as the sulfur host and suppress the diffusion of polysulfide, while the graphene conductive networks anchor the sulfur-adsorbed carbon nanosheets, providing pathways for rapid electron/ion transport and preventing polysulfide dissolution. As a result, the hybrid electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performance, including a large reversible capacity of 1328 mA h g (1) in the first cycle, excellent cycling stability (maintaining a reversible capacity of 647 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 300 cycles) with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency, and a high rate capability of 512 mA h g(-1) at 8 C for 30 cycles, which is among the best reported rate capabilities.

Herein, an oxygen-defective MnO2 nanoparticles modified carbon nanotube composite (CNT/OD-MnO2) has been proposed as multifunctional sulfur host materials. In the CNT/OD-MnO2, the continuous CNT frameworks provide abundant conduction paths of electrons, and the oxygen-defective MnO2 nanoparticles can accelerate the adsorption and conversion process of polysulfides during the charge-discharge process. As expected, the derived sulfur cathode exhibits superior electrochemical properties with the assistance of CNT/OD-MnO2. Compared with the CNT/MnO2-S (61.8%) and CNT-S (38.8%) cathodes, the CNT/OD-MnO2-S cathode delivers a higher capacity retention of 81.3% even after 300 cycles. These results confirm the promising application of CNT/OD-MnO2 as an effective sulfur host material for advanced Li-S battery. (C) 2022 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

However, the high ion-path tortuosity of most carbon/sulfur cathodes dramatically hinder their mass transport, thus leading to poor rate performance. This situation goes worse with increasing the electrode thickness. Here, we report a binder-free vertically-aligned carbon nanotube/sulfur (VACNT/S) cathode with an excellent thickness-independent mass transport and high-rate performance. Compared with a conventional disordered carbon nanotube/sulfur electrode, the highly conductive VACNTs provide directional paths for the ultrafast transfer of both lithium ions and electrons, leading to improved kinetics and a stable redox activity. The VACNT/S electrode shows an extremely high initial specific capacity of 894 mA h g(-1)at a 5 C rate, and very stable charge/discharge performance with a capacity of 486.1 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles and a low capacity decay rate of 0.1% per cycle. This work demonstrates an efficient pathway for the design of electrodes for high-rate lithium sulfur batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Porous graphene monoliths have been widely used to alleviate these problems with its confined frameworks of porous structures and strong mechanical property; however, bulk graphene materials were normally loosely packed, leading to the low utilization efficiency of pores and unsatisfactory frustration in suppressing polysulfide dissolution/shuttle owing to their large and highly open pores. Herein, we report the dense integration of sulfur and graphene (S-G) gel through the soft approach to prepare a compact sulfur cathode with dense but porous structure. The compact S-G structures could better increase the bonding between sulfur and graphene, immobilize sulfur and restrain the polysulfide diffusion within the more closed pores than loose counterpart, and thus achieve improved volumetric discharge capacities, high rate and long-term cycling performance.

Conductivity and polarity are two critical parameters for the search of optimal sulfur host materials. However, their role in immobilizing polysulfides and enhancing redox kinetics for long-life LSBs are not fully understood. This work has conducted an evaluation on the role of polarity over conductivity by using a polar but nonconductive platelet ordered mesoporous silica (pOMS) and its replica platelet ordered mesoporous carbon (pOMC), which is conductive but nonpolar. It is found that the polar pOMS/S cathode with a sulfur mass fraction of 80 wt% demonstrates outstanding long-term cycle stability for 2000 cycles even at a high current density of 2C. Furthermore, the pOMS/S cathode with a high sulfur loading of 6.5 mg cm(-2) illustrates high areal and volumetric capacities with high capacity retention. Complementary physical and electrochemical probes clearly show that surface polarity and structure are more dominant factors for sulfur utilization efficiency and long-life, while the conductivity can be compensated by the conductive agent involved as a required electrode material during electrode preparation. The present findings shed new light on the design principles of sulfur hosts towards long-life and highly efficient LSBs.

In addition, all-solid-state LSBs, which use solid-state electrolytes, have been proposed to overcome the polysulfide shuttle effect while improving safety. However, the high interfacial resistance and poor ionic conductivity exhibited by the electrode and solid-state electrolytes, respectively, are significant challenges in the development of these LSBs. Herein, we apply a poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based composite solid-state electrolyte with oxide Li La3Zr O (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte in an all-solid-state LSB to overcome these challenges. We use an electrochemical method to evaluate the degradation of the all-solid-state LSB in accordance with the carbon content and loading weight within the cathode. The all-solid-state LSB, with sulfur-carbon content in a ratio of 3:3, exhibited a high initial discharge capacity (1386 mAh g ), poor C-rate performance, and capacity retention of less than 50%. The all-solid-state LSB with a high loading weight exhibited a poor overall electrochemical performance. The factors influencing the electrochemical performance degradation were revealed through systematic analysis.

The results give unequivocal proof that nitrogen doping could assist mesoporous carbon to suppress the shuttling phenomenon, possibly via an enhanced surface interaction between the basic nitrogen functionalities and polysulfide species. However, nitrogen doping only within an appropriate level can improve the electronic conductivity of the carbon matrix. Thus, the dependence of total electrochemical performance on the nitrogen content is nonmonotone. At an optimal nitrogen content of 8.1 wt %, the carbon/sulfur composites deliver a highest reversible discharge capacity of 758 mA h g(-1) at a 0.2 C rate and 620 mA h g(-1) at a 1 C rate after 100 cycles. Furthermore, with the assistance of PPy/PEG hybrid coating, the composites could further increase the reversible capacity to 891 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. These encouraging results suggest nitrogen doping and surface coating of the carbon hosts are good strategies to improve the performance carbon/sulfur-based cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Nevertheless, the severe dissolution and migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and poor conductivity of sulfur greatly hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this work, Fe-Ni-P@nitrogen-doped carbon (named as Fe-Ni-P@NC) derived from Fe-Ni Prussian blue analog (Fe-Ni PBA) was used as highly efficient sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The Fe-Ni-P particles not only enhance the adsorption of LiPSs but also effectively promote the conversion of LiPSs. In addition, the CN- of PBAs can readily generate nitrogen-doped carbon during pyrolysis, which can improve the conductivity of composites. Due to these advantages, Li-S batteries using S@Fe-Ni-P@NC composites cathodes exhibited good electrochemical performance with outstanding rate capability and stable cycling over 500 cycles with a lower capacity fading rate of 0.08% per cycle at 1 C.

Lithium Sulfonate Functionalization of Carbon Cathodes as a Substitute for Lithium Nitrate in the Electrolyte of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						bromomethylation; Li-S batteries; lithium nitrate; lithium polysulfide shuttle; surface functionalization	MESOPOROUS CARBON; ENERGY DENSITY; NITRIC-ACID; LINO3; INTERPHASES; INTERFACE; COMPOSITE; LIQUID; ANODE; AIR	A method for grafting lithium sulfonate (LiSO3) groups to carbon surfaces is developed and the resulting carbons are evaluated for their potential to reduce the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, replacing the common electrolyte additive lithium nitrate (LiNO3). The LiSO(3)groups are attached to the ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK3) surface via a three-step procedure to synthesize LiSO3-CMK3 by bromomethylation, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) substitution, and cation exchange. As a comparison, ethylenediamine (EN)-substituted CMK3, EN-CMK3, is also synthesized and tested. When used as a cathode in Li-S batteries, the unfunctionalized CMK3 suffers from strong LiPS shuttling as evidenced by its low initial Coulombic efficiencies (ICEs, <10%) compared to its functionalized derivatives EN-CMK3 and LiSO3-CMK3 (ICEs >75%). Postcycling analysis reveals the benefits of cathode surface functionalization on the lithium anode via an attenuated LiPS shuttle. When monitored at open circuit, the functionalized cathodes maintain their cell voltages much better than the CMK3 control and concurrent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals their higher total cell resistance, which provides evidence for a reduced LiPS shuttle in the vicinity of both electrodes. Overall, such surface groups show promise as cathode-immobilized "lithium nitrate mimics."	[Fretz, Samuel J.; Palmqvist, Anders E.

Understanding the function of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide in lithium/sulfur cells	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							MOLECULAR-ORBITAL METHODS; GRAPHENE OXIDE; BASIS-SETS; SULFUR; PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDES; PARTICLES; BINDING	A surfactant material plays a significant role in creating a sulfur/carbon composite for lithium/sulfur cells. CTAB (cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide) is a widely used surfactant material in various fields. In this study we identified the functions of CTAB in a sulfur-graphene oxide composite used as the cathode material for lithium/sulfur cells, and the key features for enhancing the capacity of the cells. The CTAB added in the synthesis procedure reacts with polysulfides during the 155 degrees C heat treatment and produces cetylamine, cetylmethylamine, cetyldimetylamine, and dimethylpolysulfide as products. Furthermore the composite produced by the reactions between cetyldimetylamine and sulfur cover the surface of the sulfur. These work to enhance the performance of the cells. The findings presented here can be applied to various kinds of sulfur/carbon composites to enhance the performance of the sulfur electrode.

Herein the rational hybridization of the sp(2) nanocarbon and nanostructured porous carbon into hierarchical all-carbon nanoarchitectures is demonstrated, with full inherited advantages of the component materials. The sp(2) graphene/CNT interlinked networks give the composites good electrical conductivity and a robust framework, while the meso-/microporous carbon and the interlamellar compartment between the opposite graphene accommodate sulfur and polysulfides. The strong confinement induced by micro-/mesopores of all-carbon nanoarchitectures renders the transformation of S 8 crystal into amorphous cyclo-S-8 molecular clusters, restraining the shuttle phenomenon for high capacity retention of a lithium-sulfur cell. Therefore, the composite cathode with an ultrahigh specific capacity of 1121 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, a favorable high-rate capability of 809 mAh g(-1) at 10 C, a very low capacity decay of 0.12% per cycle, and an impressive cycling stability of 877 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles at 1 C. As sulfur loading increases from 50 wt% to 77 wt%, high capacities of 970, 914, and 613 mAh g(-1) are still available at current densities of 0.5, 1, and 5 C, respectively. Based on the total mass of packaged devices, gravimetric energy density of GSH@APC-S//Li cell is expected to be 400 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 10 000 W kg(-1), matching the level of engine driven systems.

However, the inferior cycle stability and low Coulombic efficiency mainly due to the dissolution of ploysulfides impede the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel three-dimensional clew-like N-doped multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) structure is obtained by carbonizing a kind of Ni-based metal-organic complex. When developed as conductive sulfur-loading hosts for Li-S batteries, the interconnected open-ended MWCNT materials show outstanding properties on encapsulating sulfur and immobilizing polysulfide intermediates. Moreover, the porous graphitic carbon as a conductive matrix facilitates the electron transport and the reversible electrochemical reaction of active materials during cycling. Therefore, a good cycling stability for 1000 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.053% per cycle and a high Coulombic efficiency up to nearly 100% at 0.2C are achieved for the three-dimensional clew-like N-doped MWCNT/sulfur cathode material for Li-S batteries.

The electrochemical results showed that both ACNT/S composite and ACNT/S mixture had a first reversible capacity of 1020 mA h.g(-1), and the capacity retention of ACNT/S composite was 77% after 100 cycles while that of ACNT/S mixture was only 35% with the initial capacity being 850 mA h.g(-1). The experimental results showed that the reversible lithium insertion capacity of the composite was obviously high and the cycling stability was good, which was mainly due to the solid and uniform dispersion of the sulfur and amorphous carbon nanotube matrix in the composite.

Herein, a novel "egg tray" hierarchical architecture of confining and uniformly distributing nano-sulfur into a 3D holey graphene (HG) framework with polyaniline crosslinking (3DHG/NS/CPANI) via photo-assisted method was designed for high-mass-loading LSB cathode. Notably, HG contains both conductive skeletons as electron transfer paths and abundant void spaces in favor of homogenous sulfur anchoring. This configuration improves the contact between nano-sulfur and graphene for effective charge transportation and provides buffering space for volume variations during electrochemical processes. Moreover, a facile photo-assisted method was developed to cross link HG with polyaniline to act as an efficient polysulfide adsorbent, allowing nano-sulfur (NS) to be firmly embedded into the holes of graphene through physical and chemical effects, thus prohibiting the dissolution and shuttle effect of polysulfide. Considering these advantages, the prepared 3DHG/NS/CPANI electrode exhibited excellent performance with high sulfur utilization and specific capacity, resulting in specific discharge capacities at 0.5 and 1C of 1082 and 921 mA h(-1), respectively, and small capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1C. The strategy in this work, which synergistically combines morphology control, nano-sulfur positioning, and structural engineering to enhance the electrochemical performance for Li-S batteries, will offer a valuable reference to energy storage and conversion advances.

Here, we report a strategy of using foldable interpenetrated metal-organic frameworks/carbon nanotubes thin film for binder-free advanced lithium-sulfur batteries through a facile confinement conversion. The carbon nanotubes interpenetrate through the metal-organic frameworks crystal and interweave the electrode into a stratified structure to provide both conductivity and structural integrity, while the highly porous metal-organic frameworks endow the electrode with strong sulfur confinement to achieve good cyclability. These hierarchical porous interpenetrated three-dimensional conductive networks with well confined S-8 lead to high sulfur loading and utilization, as well as high volumetric energy density.

The intense anchoring (by Fe203) and rapid electron transfer (by Fe3C) for lithium polysulfides transformation can be simultaneously achieved on the Fe203-Fe3C heterostructure interface, thus preventing the amassment of lithium polysulfides benefiting from its excellent interfacial contact and improving sulfur utilization. Experimental characterizations and DFT calculations confirmed the restrained polysulfides shuttle and enhanced redox kinetics. Therefore, the battery containing optimal Fe203-Fe3C heterostructure delivered a high capacity of 776.2 mA h g-' after 300 cycles at 1 C at a low fading rate of 0.037% per cycle. Even at a high sulfur loading of 3.5 and 4.5 mg cm -2, high capacities of 773.6 and 533.6 mA h CI at 0.5 C can be achieved with capacity retentions of 91.7 and 94.2%, respectively. This distinctive heterostructure proposes an effective design of high-performance lithium -sulfur batteries contributing to the excellent electrochemical performance, which can synergize the virtues of effectively adsorptive metal oxides and appealing conductive metal carbides.

To address these stumbling blocks, we introduced La2O3 nanorods modification of ketjen black@sulfur (La2O3/KB@S) composite that adsorbs and provides sufficient sites with Li-polysufides interaction. The La2O3 nanorods play a key role in the adsorption and catalysis performance of the polysulfides, which further accelerate the redox kinetics. Consequently, the La2O3/KB@S cathode with sulfur loading of 3.1 mg cm(-2) attained a high initial discharge capacity of 833 mAh g(-1) at a 0.5C rate and displayed excellent cyclic stability with reversible capacity of 380 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with an average of 98% coulombic efficiency. Further, even with high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2), the La2O3/KB@S cathode also presents a capacity of 4.9 mAh at 0.3C and still maintains a stable value of 3.87 mAh after 150 cycles. The results suggest the multifunction La2O3 nanorods anchoring effectively and catalyzing are beneficial to realize the goal of the large-scale application with high load active materials and high-performance LSB.

But, their widespread commercialization has been limited by several obstacles. Elemental sulfur is not conductive electrically and electrochemical conversion during cycles causes intense change in volume. In this work, a sulfur/polyaniline/nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (S@PANi-NGA) nanocomposite synthesized through a facile chemical procedure. Nitrogen-doped amino functionalized graphene aerogel (NGA) used as cross-linker for polyaniline to improve the stability of the entire cathode framework. Also, NGA possesses porous structure, high surface area, and enhances electronic conductance due to the nitrogen atoms doped into graphene sheets. As a result, S@PANi-NGA delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1332 mAh g(-1) at a scan rate of 0.2 C and 872 mAh g(-1) of the capacity retained after 100 cycles. The performance was clearly superior to the sulfur/PANi binary composite, in which pure polyaniline used as accommodator.

Nevertheless, its commercialization is still hampered in virtue of the poor conductivity of sulfur and grievous polysulfide shuttling. To address these issues, in this work, we report a cost-efficient and facile tactic to fabricate frame-structured neodymium-doped bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanoarchitectures, which are reasonably designed as a polysulfide shield to alleviate the shuttling effects. The synthesized nanoarchitectures exhibit typical tetragonal phase with a unique frame structure. The frame structure of BiVO4 impedes polysulfide shuttling, and supplies electronic and ionic transmission routes. Furthermore, the rational doping of neodymium within the BiVO4 nanoarchitectures can improve electric conductivity, as well as efficiently alleviate the loss of sulfur and improve activity for sulfur reduction. Benefitting from the structural feature and doping strategy, the Li-S battery performance with a neodymium-doped BiVO4 nanoarchitecture is significantly improved.

Herein, we report a polyimide-based Janus separator by a simple filtration method introducing MoO3 nanoparticles and MWCNTs-COOH. Using this separator, the lithium-sulfur battery delivers a reversible capacity of 1274 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and a capacity 637 mA h g(-1) at 5 C. Moreover, the separator is flame-retardant and thermal-stable without obvious shrinkage even at 300 degrees C. Experimental observations reveal that uniformly dispersed MoO3 nanoparticles and MWCNTs-COOH as a pore structure regulator can obviously decrease the pore diameter and porosity of electrospun polyimide (PI) skeleton for intercepting polysulfides. The synergistic effect between MWCNTs-COOH, MoO3 and polyimide fibers enables the faster kinetics and more efficient conversion of polysulfides. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Generally, the areal sulfur-loading amount is less than 2.0 mg cm(-2), resulting in a low areal capacity far below the acceptable value for practical applications. In this contribution, a hierarchical free-standing carbon nanotube (CNT)-S paper electrode with an ultrahigh sulfur-loading of 6.3 mg cm(-2) is fabricated using a facile bottom-up strategy. In the CNT-S paper electrode, short multi-walled CNTs are employed as the short-range electrical conductive framework for sulfur accommodation, while the super-long CNTs serve as both the long-range conductive network and the intercrossed mechanical scaffold. An initial discharge capacity of 6.2 mAh center dot cm(-2) (995 mAh center dot g(-1)), a 60% utilization of sulfur, and a slow cyclic fading rate of 0.20%/cycle within the initial 150 cycles at a low current density of 0.05 C are achieved. The areal capacity can be further increased to 15.1 mAh center dot cm(-2) by stacking three CNT-S paper electrodesresulting in an areal sulfur-loading of 17.3 mg cm(-2)for the cathode of a Li-S cell. The as-obtained free-standing paper electrode are of low cost and provide high energy density, making them promising for flexible electronic devices based on Li-S batteries.

However, the areal energy density of sulfur electrodes is usually low due to an excess amount of inactive materials, mostly carbon, in the electrode composite. Typically, the electrode layers must be thin to achieve good specific capacity and cyclic stability. This further reduces the areal capacities, and it is challenging to design high areal density sulfur electrodes. Herein, the possibility of achieving high areal energy density by using ultramicroporous carbon-sulfur (UMC-S) composite electrodes is investigated. For this purpose, the weight of sulfur per area is systematically varied by varying the amount of UMC-S, and its electrochemical performance with respect to current density, cycling voltage window, electrolyte amount, and effect of temperature on cycling is investigated. A sulfur loading of up to 9.7 mg cm(-2) and areal capacities above 4.5 mAh cm(-2) are attained. The results indicate that a high areal energy density can be achieved with UMC-S electrodes, however, at lower current rates. Higher current rates can be achieved by reducing the particle size and by improving the intrinsic electronic conductivity of the UMC host.	[Helen, M.; Fichtner, Maximilian; Reddy, M.

P-MCNT is prepared by a simple electrospinning method using coaxial needles, followed by heat treatment and etching. P-MCNT developed multichannel inner pores of different sizes in an axial direction when different amounts of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were added. The sidewall-holes are prepared by adding SiO2 to the electrospinning solution followed by etching. As the porosity increases, the sulfur content reaches a maximum of 78 wt%. The sulfur/P-MCNT composite for Li-S batteries exhibits superior performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 1315 mAh g(-1) and maintained satisfactory cyclability. This superior performance was ascribed to the morphology of the P-MCNT, which both captured sulfur and restricted its loss during the charge-discharge process. In addition, the introduction of more pores into the carbon material facilitated the diffusion of lithium ions into the electrodes and improved the interfacial charge transfer. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this work three different processes were employed to prepare three types of bamboo derived porous carbon materials. Among them, the sample prepared via a one-step activation method delivered the largest total pore volume (1.146 cm(3) g(-1)) and the largest specific surface area (1824.4 m(2) g(-1)) owning to a hierarchical porous structure. After the sample was used to encapsulate sulfur (S) to prepare carbon/S composite as cathodes for Li-S batteries. The composite loaded with 58.5 wt% S exhibited a high initial capacity of 1453 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)). A reversible capacity of 255 mAh g(-1) was maintained after 500 cycles at 1 C with a capacity decay rate of only 0.0016% per cycle. This suggests that the bamboo derived porous carbon could be a promising conductive carbon matrix for carbon/S composite cathodes in Li-S batteries. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Regardless of the solid-state like appearance, the quasi-solid-state electrolyte exhibited a high liquid-like apparent conductivity of 1.2 x 10(-4)S cm(-1) at 308 K when the volume ratio of DEME-TFSA-Li-TFSA is 75% in the quasi-solid-state composite. By using the quasi-solid-state electrolyte, a quasi-solid-state lithium-sulfur battery was developed and the cell performance was evaluated. The cell has successfully exhibited initial discharge capacities of 1370 mAh g(-1) at 308 K with a 0.05C via the conversion reaction of sulfur and lithium. During 10 charge-discharge cycles, the discharge capacity decreased to 600 mAhg(-1) due to the lower utilization ratio of sulfur by agglomeration of Li2S at the electrode/electrolyte interface.

J	Zukalova, M; Vinarcikova, M; Bousa, M; Kavan, L				Zukalova, Marketa; Vinarcikova, Monika; Bousa, Milan; Kavan, Ladislav			Nanocrystalline TiO2/Carbon/Sulfur Composite Cathodes for Lithium-Sulfur Battery	NANOMATERIALS			English	Article						lithium&#8211; sulfur; titanium oxide; active carbon; electrochemical carbon; mesoporous carbon; battery; surface area		This paper evaluates the influence of the morphology, surface area, and surface modification of carbonaceous additives on the performance of the corresponding cathode in a lithium-sulfur battery. The structure of sulfur composite cathodes with mesoporous carbon, activated carbon, and electrochemical carbon is studied by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption measurements, and Raman spectroscopy. The sulfur cathode containing electrochemical carbon with the specific surface area of 1606.6 m(2) g(-1) exhibits the best electrochemical performance and provides a charge capacity of almost 650 mAh g(-1) in cyclic voltammetry at a 0.1 mV s(-1) scan rate and up to 1300 mAh g(-1) in galvanostatic chronopotentiometry at a 0.1 C rate. This excellent electrochemical behavior is ascribed to the high dispersity of electrochemical carbon, enabling a perfect encapsulation of sulfur. The surface modification of carbonaceous additives by TiO2 has a positive effect on the electrochemical performance of sulfur composites with mesoporous and activated carbons, but it causes a loss of dispersity and a consequent decrease of the charge capacity of the sulfur composite with electrochemical carbon. The composite of sulfur with TiO2-modified activated carbon exhibited the charge capacity of 393 mAh g(-1) in cyclic voltammetry and up to 493 mAh g(-1) in galvanostatic chronopotentiometry. The presence of an additional Sigracell carbon felt interlayer further improves the electrochemical performance of cells with activated carbon, electrochemical carbon, and nanocrystalline TiO2-modified activated carbon. This positive effect is most pronounced in the case of activated carbon modified by nanocrystalline TiO2. However, it is not boosted by additional coverage by TiO2 or SnO2, which is probably due to the blocking of pores.

Single-atom catalyst (SAC) materials hold the promise of strong LiPS binding to the cathode and improved reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries. In this study, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of four SAC materials with TM-N-4-C (TM = Co, Fe, V, and W) formation, from simulations based on the density functional theory. We study for the first time a W-based SAC as the Li-S cathode host and calculate the adsorption energy of five LiPS intermediates (Li2Sn, n = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8). We explore the mechanism for the conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S and present the energy profiles based on the Gibbs free energy for the LiPS reaction pathway from S-8 to Li2S. V- and W-based SACs provide high LiPS binding, of up to 6.0 times of pristine graphene, and largely improved reaction kinetics by lowering the S dissociation barrier of the Li2S2 decomposition by similar to 2.5 times compared to pristine graphene. Our work provides a detailed investigation into the adsorption and conversion of LiPSs on SAC cathode hosts, highlighting their potential on improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries and mitigating the LiPS "shuttle" effect.

However, their commercial applications are still far away mainly due to fast capacity decay in a high sulfur content caused by low utilization of active material and severe polysulfide dissolution during electrochemical cycling. Here we have designed and prepared uniform alpha-Ni(OH)(2) hollow spheres constructed from ultrathin nanosheets with the thickness of similar to 3.5 nm as a hollow sulfur nanosphere host for Li-S batteries. Specifically, the synthesized hierarchical hollow spheres not only manifest the advantages of hollow structure and robust protective shell to encapsulate a very high content of sulfur up to 81 wt%, but also offer sufficient functionalized surfaces to directly bond and entrap polysulfides in hollow sphere. When used as cathode materials for Li-S batteries, the S@Ni(OH)(2) double-shell hollow hybrids exhibit a highly stable cycle life over 1000 cycles at 1 C with a very small capacity decay rate of only similar to 0.04% per cycle.

However, a high sulfur loading produced using traditional blade coating techniques results in many technical issues such as sluggish electron/ion transport kinetics and cracking of the electrodes. Here a well designed two-step electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique is proposed to prepare a flexible, multilayer carbon electrode with a high sulfur areal loading, in which different carbon components by a careful selection are used for different functions in each layer. The unique "aerosol deposition" in the ESD creates buffer voids in the electrode, ensuring fast infiltration of the electrolyte and releasing the internal stress of the electrode thus avoiding the cracking of thick electrodes. With such an integrated design, the as-prepared cathode exhibits excellent flexibility, a long cyclic stability with a low capacity decay of 0.064% per cycle at 1 C for 500 cycles and a high rate capability of 736 mAh g(-1) at 2 C. Moreover, a high areal sulfur loading of 9.4 mg cm(-2) with an areal capacity of 6.2 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C has been achieved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such a dual-confined sulfur cathode, denoted as S@alpha-MnO2-PEDOT, showed high performance in lithium-sulfur batteries. It could reach a capacity of 774.4 mAh.g(-1) at a current density of 1 675 mA.g(-1) (1C) after 200 cycles and 854.1 mAh.g(-1) at a current density of 3 350 mA.g(-1) (2C), manifesting excellent cycling stability and rate capability. The outstanding performances are attributed to the new architecture. In the novel architecture, alpha-MnO2 nanotubes not only provide the physical confinement for sulfur, but also enhance the chemical interaction between the sulfur host material and polysulfides.

J	Chen, Y; Kang, Q; Jiang, PK; Huang, XY				Chen, Yu; Kang, Qi; Jiang, Pingkai; Huang, Xingyi			Rapid, high-efficient and scalable exfoliation of high-quality boron nitride nanosheets and their application in lithium-sulfur batteries	NANO RESEARCH			English	Article						boron nitride nanosheets; cavitation; sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation (SALPE); modified separators; lithium-sulfur batteries	LARGE-SCALE EXFOLIATION; HIGH-YIELD PRODUCTION; POTENTIAL APPLICATION; LIQUID EXFOLIATION; PHASE EXFOLIATION; IONIC LIQUID; GRAPHENE; POLYMER; GRAPHITE; COMPOSITES	Boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) have gained significant attraction in energy and environment fields because of their two-dimensional (2D) nature, large band gap and high thermal/mechanical performance. However, the current low production efficiency of high-quality BNNSs is still a bottleneck limiting their applications. Herein, based on sonication-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation, we demonstrated a rapid, high-efficient and scalable production strategy of BNNSs and documented the effects of a spectrum of exfoliation factors (e.g., ultrasonic condition, solvent and bulk material feeding) on the yield of BNNSs. A record of yield of 72.5% was achieved while the exfoliated BNNSs have few-layer and defect-free feature. Thanks to the Lewis acid sites of the boron atoms, the BNNSs can interact with the polysulfide anions in liquid electrolyte and also can facilitate the uniform lithium deposition, which finally endow a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery with long life. This work provides a facile and rapid strategy for large scale preparation of high-quality BNNSs, also contributes a long-life strategy for dendrite-free Li-S battery, opens new avenues of BNNSs in energy application.

A high-performance sulfur reservoir is one of the most critical components for LSBs to protect the soluble lithium polysulfides (LPSs) from shuttling to lithium anode. Herein, titanium oxide nanowire clots (TOCs) with a two-phase composition and high effective absorption surface area (270.1 m(2)g(-1)) are designed as promising reservoirs to accommodate sulfur and LPSs. The synergistic effects generated from the unique structure of TOCs make the obtained S/TOCs cathode materials exhibit high specific capacity, high coulombic efficiency, and excellent cyclic stability at 1C and 2C rates. The corresponding capacity fading rates per cycle are around 0.14% and 0.11 % for the LSBs being (dis)charged 1C and 2C, respectively. (C) 2021 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, by selectively coating a set of 2-demensional (2D) organic molecules, chenodeoxycholic acid (CA), 4,4',4 '',4 '''-(porphine-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrakis (benzoic acid) (TTBA), berberine chloride hydrate (BCH) and poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA) on honey comb-like porous carbon (HC) interlayers, respectively, the redox kinetics of PSs are remarkably enhanced in the interspace between the 2D molecules and carbon matrix, in the order of CA<TTBA<BCH<PDDA, with the most efficient molecules featured with positively charged amino groups. The capacity of Li-S batteries with PDDA on HC interlayer goes up to 637.6 mAh g(-1) at 10 C and maintains 601.7 and 483.5 mAh g(-1) after 1200 cycles at 2 C and 4 C, corresponding to a decay as low as 0.024% and 0.031% per cycle. Moreover, a reversible high areal capacity of 8.4 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C and superior stability was achieved at a sulfur loading of 8.9 mg cm(-2). This surface passivation technique is demonstrated to be a general strategy for any other carbon materials in promoting the redox kinetics of PSs as interlayers in Li-S batteries.

Here, for the first time, we have used inexpensive oleic acid as a single carbon source, and have added commercial SiO(2)as a template to form a porous structure, whereas introducing Fe(NO3)(3)and Ni(NO3)(2)as catalysts to increase the degree of graphitization. Moreover, the dual metal salts Fe(NO3)(3)and Ni(NO3)(2)can also form FeNi(3)alloy, and our results show that FeNi(3)nanoparticles accelerate the kinetic conversion reactions of polysulfide. By virtue of the well-developed porous structure and high degree of graphitization, the highly graphitized porous carbon-FeNi3(GPC-FeNi3) has high conductivity to ensure fast charge transfer, and the hierarchically porous structure facilitates ion diffusion and traps polysulfide. Thus, a GPC-FeNi3/S cathode displays excellent electrochemical performance. At current rates of 0.2 and 1 C, a cathode of the GPC-FeNi3/S composite with a sulfur content of 70 % delivers high initial discharge capacities of 1108 and 880 mA h g(-1), respectively, and retains reversible specific capacities of 850 mA h g(-1)after 200 cycles at 0.2 C and 625 mA h g(-1)after 400 cycles at 1 C.

However, many challenges remain, such as the design of cathode with high sulfur loading, suppression of shuttle effects, enhanced performance and large scale preparation. Here, we report a novel 3D free-standing nitrogen-doped porous carbon foam (PCF) obtained by carbonization of the natural melaleuca bark, and apply it as a binder-free current collector to host sulfur for Li-S cells. This study shows that the obtained N-doped PCF possesses sheet-like porous carbon structures, high specific surface area, and large pore volume. Taking advantage of these properties, the resulting PCF/S electrodes exhibit an initial discharge capacity of 1330 mAh g(-1), good reversible capacity of 880 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and deliver an excellent cycling stability (over 250 cycles at 0.5 C with 0.14% capacity fading per cycle). In addition, the PCF/S electrodes with large areal mass loading of 6 mg cm(-2) show a high areal capacity of 4.14 mAh cm(-2), revealing a great potential for high energy Li-S batteries.

Functionalization of commercial polypropylene (PP) separators has been considered as a promising alternative strategy for further mitigation of the "shuttle effect" of LPSs. Herein, we re-engineer the surface of PP separator with a sodium-containing TiO2 hybrid composed of nanowires and nanosheets (STO-W/S), forming a unique sandwich-like surface layer. The polar nature of STO surface layer indubitably improves its wettability to electrolyte, subsequently enhancing Li+ conductivity. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of the sandwiched sheet/nanowire hybrid structure, its strong chemical adsorption and the regeneration capability of STO-W/S to LPSs effectively suppresses the "shuttling" of LPSs. As expected, LSBs coupled with STO-W/S modified PP separators show superior electrochemical performance. They deliver high discharge capacity of 813 mAh.g(-1) at 1C and superior cycling stability with a capacity fading rate of 0.067% for each cycle, and the capacity was still maintained at similar to 541 mAh.g(-1) for 500 cycles. Based on the aforementioned advantages, this newly-proposed functionalization strategy for separators can be a promising route to develop the next-generation multifunctional separators for high-performance LSBs.

Rational structural design can improve the sulfur storage capacity of carbon materials, and appropriate heteroatom doping can enhance the adsorption capacity for lithium polysulfides, thus improving the cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we synthesized nitrogen doped porous carbon spheres (NHCSs) with high nitrogen content as cathode host materials for lithium-sulfur batteries, and prepared porous carbon spheres with different nitrogen contents by heat treatment. In comparison, the porous carbon spheres with the highest nitrogen content possess the best polysulfide adsorption capacity and electrochemical activity, leading to a high initial capacity of 806.54 mA h g(-1) at 2C and excellent capacity retention rate of 85.71% after 500 cycles. The high electrochemical reversibility and reaction mechanism of carbon spheres with high nitrogen content were confirmed by in situ Raman and in situ XRD. Moreover, NHCS-1/S still exhibits a high areal capacity of 4.11 mA h cm(-2) even with a sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2). This study provides a new strategy and direction for the design of carbon materials as cathode host materials for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, a facile solid-state growth strategy is reported for the first time to fabricate highly nitrogen doped CNT-graphene 3D nanostructures without the necessity to use chemical vapor deposition. As cathode hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries, the hybrid architectures exhibit reversible capacities of 1314 and 922 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 and 1 C, respectively, and a capacity retention of 97% after 200 cycles at a high rate of 2 C, revealing their great potential for energy storage application.

However, their practical deployment encounters challenges with respect to optimizing the cell-fabrication parameters (e.g., amounts of the active material and electrolyte). We present here an "ant-nest-like" cathode substrate with unique architecture to synchronously attain high electrochemical performance and necessary cell-fabrication parameters. The cells with a high sulfur loading (11.5 mg cm(-2)), a high sulfur content (75 wt%), and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (9 mu L mg(-1)) display a high areal capacity and energy density of, respectively, 7 mA h cm(-2) and 14 mW h cm(-2) with a capacity retention of 70% after 150 cycles. Moreover, the cells exhibit a low self-discharge behavior with a low self-discharge constant of 0.0013 per day and a long rest period of one month. These dynamic and static electrochemical stabilities are attributed to the ant-nest-like structure and low surface area of the cathode substrate that allows, respectively, the accommodation and encapsulation of a high amount of active material and reduces the consumption of electrolyte.

However, lithium-sulfur batteries are still facing some problems that hinder their large-scale commercial application. High conductivity molybdenum dioxide coated with carbon composite (MoO2@C) were introduced to coat the separator to study its application in lithium sulfur batteries. Molybdenum dioxide coated with carbon composite nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method and high-temperature calcination and then was coated on the separator with acetylene black. The coating layer can take advantage of the synergetic effect of physical barrier and chemical adsorption to reduce the loss of active substances. The electrochemical performance of the battery has been improved by applying MoO2@C in lithium-sulfur separator. The first discharge specific capacity is 917 mA h g(-1) under the current density of 1.0 A g(-1), after 300 cycles, the capacity is 618 mA h g(-1); after 200 cycles under the current density of 2.0 A g(-1), the reversible specific capacity can still maintain 551 mA h g(-1).

These losses are caused by dissolution of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) in ether-based electrolytes and have become the main bottleneck to widespread applications of LSBs. Therefore, there is a significant need for electrode materials that have a strong adsorption capacity for LiPS. Herein, a waterborne polyurethane (WPUN) containing sulfamic acid (NH2SO3H) polymer is designed and synthesized as an aqueous-based, ecofriendly binder by neutralizing sulfamic acid with a tung oil-based polyurethane prepolymer. UV-vis spectroscopy shows that the WPUN strongly immobilizes LiPS and thus is an effective inhibitor of the LiPS. Moreover, the WPUN binder has excellent adhesive and mechanical properties that improve the integrity of sulfur cathodes. The WPUN-based cathodes exhibit a significant improvement in their specific capacity and maintain a capacity of 617 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C. Besides, the LSBs assembled with the WPUN-based cathodes show good rate performance from 0.2C (737 mAh g(-1)) to 4C (586 mAh g(-1)), which is significantly higher than that of LSBs assembled with a commercial polymer binder. The structural design of the presented binder provides a new perspective for obtaining high-performance LSBs.

The fabricated hPANIs@S composite presented an excellent reversible capacity of 601.9 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 170 mA g(-1). The capacity increased with the cycle increase, especially at high charge/discharge current. For example, the capacity had only approximate 270 mAh g(-1) after initial 121th cycle at 510 mA g(-1), and the capacity steadily increased to 380 mAh g(-1) after 180th cycle at similar current. These results indicated that cycle property improved compared with that of pure sulfur prepared through in situ synthesis under similar conditions. The enhanced cycle property of the hPANIs@S composite could be due to the homogeneous distribution of fine sulfur particles on the PANI surface, which stabilized the nanostructure of sulfur and enhanced its conductivity during charge/discharge cycles.

The lamellar carbon exhibited a highly mesoporous structure with favorable pore size distribution, large surface area and good electrical conductivity derived from the intrinsic thin-walled parenchyma cells of bagasse. The produced lithium-sulfur battery exhibited excellent cycle stability, due to the unique pore structure of bagasse that can accommodate the drastic volume change during battery cycling, and good rate performance, due to the high electrical conductivity of bagasse derived carbon after pyrolysis. A high initial reversible capacity of 1202 mA h g(-1) (S) at 0.1C as well as a reversible capacity of 494 mA h g(-1) (S) after 180 cycles at 1C was achieved, and the capacity retention was also found to be more than 70% at 1C. The designed processing method for the facile production of lamellar mesoporous carbon derived from direct carbonization of bagasse should be a feasible method for the mass production of cathode materials for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Their performance varies with electrolytes and the electrode-electrolyte compatibility, and it is not possible yet to assert which kind of electrolyte could lead to the optimum performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, different sulfur/carbon composites are prepared in both crystalline and amorphous states by heating. The products are systematically studied as electrodes in lithium-sulfur batteries containing two types of electrolytes: ether-based electrolyte and carbonate-based electrolyte. The amorphous composite exhibits less polarization than the crystalline one in both electrolytes and can achieve higher utilization of sulfur in ether-based electrolyte at a low current density and better cycle stability in carbonate-based electrolyte at a high current density. Furthermore, the kinetics, to be specific, the surface activation energy and lithium ion diffusivity of the electrode in those two electrolytes are presented to properly shed light on the electrochemical performance of the composites being investigated.

The composites were characterized by N-2 adsorption, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical tests. It was found that the composite showing the best performance was the one in which the MWCNT diameter was in the range 10-20 nm and the sulfur content was 85 mass%. SEM confirms that the composite has a MWCNT-core and sulfur-shell structure. Sulfur not only covered the suffice of the MWCNTs, but also filled the voids between the tubes. For the optimized composite the initial discharge capacity is 1272.8 mAh.g(-1)-sulfur and the capacity remaining after 80 cycles is 720.1 mAh.g(-1)-sulfur. Its active material utilization and capacity retention rates are 76.0 and 64.4%, respectively. The active material utilization and cycling performance of the composite are greatly improved compared with a sulfur electrode without the MWCNTs, owing to a high electrical conductivity of the MWCNTs and the stable structure of the composite.

However, the intermediate charge-discharge product dissolves easily into the electrolyte to produce a shuttle effect, which is a key factor limiting the rapid development of Li-S batteries. Among the various materials used to solve the challenges related to pure sulfur cathodes, biomass derived carbon materials are getting wider research attention. In this work, we report on the fabrication of cathode materials for Li-S batteries based on composites of sulfur and biomass-derived porous ramie carbon (RC), which are coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). RC can not only adsorb polysulfide in its pores, but also provide conductive channels. At the same time, the MWCNTs coating further reduces the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte and weakens the shuttle effect. The sulfur loading rate of RC is 66.3 wt.%. As a result, the initial discharge capacity of the battery is 1325.6 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.1 C long cycle, and it can still maintain 812.5 mAh center dot g(-1) after 500 cycles. This work proposes an effective double protection strategy for the development of advanced Li-S batteries.

The morphology and structure of composite were studied by x-ray photoelectron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction analysis. The nanocomposites exhibited good electrochemical performance involving good rate performance, high capacity, and promising cycling stability. The good performance of S-PANI-G results from the synergistic effect of sulfur, polyaniline, and graphene oxide. The composite and method reported here pave the way for the design and synthesis of novel cathode materials for LSBs.

Herein, for the first time, we present high-entropy oxide (HEO, (Mg0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2Co0.2Zn0.2)Fe2O4) nanofibers as catalytic host of sulfur. The HEO nanofibers show a synergistic effect among multiple metal cations in spinel structure that enables strong chemical confinement of soluble polysulfides and fast kinetics for polysulfide conversion. Consequently, the S/HEO composite displays the high gravimetric capacity of 1368.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C rate, excellent rate capability with the discharge capacity of 632.1 mAh g(-1) at 5 C rate, and desirable cycle stability. Furthermore, the S/HEO composite shows desirable sulfur utilization and good cycle stability under a harsh operating condition of high sulfur loading (4.6 mg cm(-2)) or low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (5 mu L mg(-1)). More impressively, the high volumetric capacity of 2627.9 mAh cm(-3) is achieved simultaneously for the S/HEO composite due to the high tap density of 1.92 g cm(-3), nearly 2.5 times of the conventional sulfur/carbon composite. Therefore, based on high-entropy oxide materials, this work affords a fresh concept of elevating the gravimetric/volumetric capacities of sulfur cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Nevertheless, the inevitable "shuttle effect" of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) leads to poor cycle stability. Herein, we report the in-situ coating MnO2 nanosheets on the Co3O4@C nanospheres (Co3O4@C@MnO2) as modified separators for LSBs. The study shows that the outer layer of MnO2 has a high affinity for LiPSs and can anchor LiPSs through strong chemical adsorption. The internal Co3O4@C has admirable catalytic activity, which can accelerate the complete conversion of LiPSs to Li2S. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between the outer layer MnO2 on the adsorption of LiPSs and the inner Co3O4@C on the catalysis of LiPSs, the cells exhibit an outstanding electrochemical performance, including high reversible capacity of 734 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, a low-capacity decay rate of 0.0406% per cycle around 500 cycles. This work provides an impressive method for high-performance LSBs.

The prepared SPC is employed as a conductive matrix in the sulfur cathode (S-SPC) for lithium-sulfur secondary batteries. The BET surface area of the prepared SPC sample is as high as 1,133 m(2) g(-1) and the total pore volume is 2.75 cm(3) g(-1). The electrochemical evaluations including charge-discharge tests, cyclic voltammograms (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectrum suggest that the prepared S-SPC composite presents superior electrochemical stability when compared to the S-SP cathode. The as-prepared S-SPC composite shows improved cycle performance. The reversible discharge capacity is about 637 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, which is much better than that of the as-prepared sulfur-Super P carbon black composite. It may be attributed to the high porosity and excellent conductive structure of the SPC.

In this study, a high catalytic active CNTs@FeOOH composite is introduced as a functional interlayer for Li-S batteries. Interestingly, the existence of oxygen vacancy in FeOOH functions electrocatalyst and promotes the catalytic conversion of intercepted lithium polysulfides (LiPS). As a result, the optimized CNTs@FeOOH interlayer contributed to a high reversible capacity of 556 mAh g(-1) at 3,200 mA g(-1) over 350 cycles. This study demonstrates that enhanced catalytic effect can accelerate conversion efficiency of polysulfides, which is beneficial of boosting high performance Li-S batteries.

J	Chen, KF; Xue, DF				Chen, Kunfeng; Xue, Dongfeng			Multiple Functional Biomass-Derived Activated Carbon Materials for Aqueous Supercapacitors, Lithium-Ion Capacitors and Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						activated carbon; lithium ion capacitor; rice husk; biomass utilization; organic electrolyte	POROUS CARBON; RICE HUSK; ENERGY-STORAGE; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; DENSITY	Biomass-derived activated carbon electrode materials have been synthesized by carbonization and KOH activation processes from an agriculture waste - rice husk, composed of organic compound and silica. The surface area of activated carbon reached 1098.1 m(2)/g mainly including mesopores and macropores due to the template effect of silica in rice husk. Owing to the existence of mesopores and macropores, the as-obtained activated carbon materials can be used in aqueous supercapacitors, lithium-ion (Li-ion) capacitors and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In KOH electrolyte, fast rate performance (as high as 2 V/s) was obtained due to the existence of ideal electrical double layer capacitance. In organic electrolyte, high voltage (2.5 V) was achieved. Activated carbon electrode for Li-ion capacitor also showed capacity of 17 mAh/g at 100 mA/g with the high voltage range of 2.5 V. The capacities of sulfur- activated carbon in Li-S batteries were 1230 and 970 mAh/g at the current densities of 0.1 and 0.2 C. The present results showed that activated carbon materials with mesopores were good host to immobilize polysulfides.

To address above issues, we report a new super-high ionic conductive gel polymer (SHGP) electrolyte (2.2 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 60 degrees C and 0.75 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 30 degrees C), which are significant characteristics for greatly improved quasi-solid-state lithium sulfur battery performance. Moreover, the SHGP electrolyte exhibited strong adsorptivity to lithium polysulfides as the polar functional groups in the SHGP electrolyte through chemical adsorption, leading to the suppressed shuttle effect, which was theoretically confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimentally verified by in-situ UV/Vis results. Such high ionic polymer electrolyte enables a greatly improved specific capacity of 950 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and outstanding cycling performance for 400 cycles at 1.5 C, which is far beyond that of conventional poly (ethylene oxide) based quasi-solid-state battery.

The saturation solubility of sulfur and lithium polysulfides (Li2Sm), the active materials in the Li-S battery, in the electrolytes was quantitatively determined, and the performance of the Li-S battery using the electrolytes was also investigated. Although the solubility of nonionic sulfur was low in all of the electrolytes evaluated, the solubility of Li2Sm in the IL-based electrolyte was strongly dependent on the anionic structure, and the difference in the solubility could be rationalized in terms of the donor ability of the IL solvent. Dissolution of Li2Sm in the ILs with strong donor ability was comparable to that achieved with typical organic electrolytes; the strongly donating IL electrolyte did not prevent redox shuttle reaction in the Li-S cells. The battery performance was also influenced by unfavorable side reactions of the anions (such as tetrafluoroborate (BF4-) and bis(fluorosulfonylamide) ([FSA](-))) with polysulfides and by slow mass transport in viscous ILs, even though the dissolution of Li2Sm into the IL electrolyte was greatly suppressed. Among the IL-based electrolytes, the low-viscosity [TFSA]-based ILs facilitated stable charge/discharge of the Li-S batteries with high capacity and high Coulombic efficiency. The unique solvent effect of the ILs can thus be exploited in the Li-S battery by judicious selection of ILs that exhibit high lithium-ion-transport ability and electrochemical stability in the presence of Li2Sm.

However, the application of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) to assemble quasi-solid-state LSBs opens up a novel research prospective to enhance the cycle life and security. Herein, we propose a 3D membrane, in which the ultraviolet polymerized pentaerythritol tetrakis-divinyl adipate (PETT-DA) serves as the in situ 3D network to simultaneously restrict lithium dendrite and shuttle effect, the long-chain poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoro propylene) (PVDF-HFP) is the co-doped polymer to guarantee high ionic conductivity and toughness, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) act as the interactive nanofillers without the phenomenon of short circuit even when the content reaches 2.5 wt% because of the negligible electronic conductivity. More significantly, the intermolecular hydrogen bonds triggered by MWCNTs further reduce the crystallinity of the membrane, contributing to the superior performance of LSBs. Prominently, the designed 3D GPEs possess the increased Li+ transference number of 0.64 and superior ionic conductivity up to 1.1 x 10(-3) S cm(-1). Furthermore, the assembled LSBs exhibit stable cycling performance with the capacity retention of 85.4% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C, demonstrating the superior electrochemical performance.

However, the insulative sulfur, the volume expansion and high soluble polysulfides are three roots impeding their practical applications, and consequently bring challenges of low sulfur utilization, poor cyclic stability and sluggish redox kinetics. Herein, a special core-shell ZnS-CNTs/S@Ni(OH)2 (labeled as ZnS-CNTs/S@NH) cathode has been designed to overcome above obstacles and elevate the electrochemical performance. The ZnS-CNTs/ S@NH cathode is synthesized via a facile step-by-step strategy, in which ZnS-decorated CNTs was used as a framework to load sulfur and followed with a ultrathin Ni(OH)2 (NH) layer encapsulation. The ZnS-CNT core combines merits of CNT network and polar ZnS quantum dots (QDs), accommodating the volume change, offering efficient pathways for fast electron/ion transport, and anchoring polysulfides through polar interactions. The outer Ni(OH)2 shell physically confines the active material and meanwhile provides plenty of catalytic sites for effective polysulfide chemisorption. Benefiting from these merits, the ZnS-CNTs/S@NH cathode exhibits excellent cell performances in comparison with ZnSCNTs/S and CNTs/S. Its discharge capacity at different C-rates is optimal in the three cathodes, which decreases from 1037.0 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C to 646.1 mAh g-1 at 2.0 C. Its cyclic capacity also manifests the slowest reduction from 861.1 to 760.1 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles at 0.5 C, showing a high retention (88.3%) and a tiny average fading rate (0.078%). The strategy in this work provides a feasible approach to design and construct core-shell cathode materials for realizing practically usable Li-S batteries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, its large scale commercialization is limited by inherent defects of sulfur cathode such as poor electronic conductivity and polysulfide shuttle effect. Herein, we report that titanium carbide particles embedded in CMK-3 mesoporous carbon (TiC/C) with the assistance of supercritical CO2 fluid is highly effective sulfur host to improve cycling capability and rate performance. Compared with TiO2/C-S and CMK-3-S, the TiC/C-S cathode exhibits higher reversible capacity and better cycling performance. It delivers high specific capacities at various C-rates ( 866, 622, and 438 mAh g(-1) at 0.1, 0.5, and 2 A g(-1), respectively) and remarkable capacity retention of 73% ( 200 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1)). The excellent electrochemical properties of TiC/C-S can be attributed to the polar nature and high conductivity of TiC particles. The present work provides a novel strategy in synthesizing cathode materials for high performance Li-S battery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, MoP quantum dot-modified N,P-doped hollow PPy substrates are adopted as separator modification coatings for LSBs. The MoP quantum dots exhibit excellent chemisorption and catalytic conversion capabilities for polysulfides, while the N,P-doped PPy substrates can provide flexible channels for Li+/electron transport and act as a physical barrier to suppress the shuttle effect. As a result, LSBs assembled with modified separators exhibit excellent rate capability (739 mAh/g at 3 C) and cycle performance (600 mAh/g at 1 C after 600 cycles, 0.052% decay per cycle). Moreover, even under a high sulfur loading of 3.68 mg/cm(2), areal capacities of 3.58 and 2.92 mAh/cm(2) for the 1st cycle and 110th cycle are achieved. In addition, according to density functional theory calculations, MoP quantum dots have large adsorption energy for S-8 and Li2Sn which further confirms the possibility of lowering the initial nucleation energy barrier of Li2S and helps to improve the kinetics of the subsequent Li2S reaction. This study proposes a novel method for using transitionmetal phosphides as catalysts in high-performance LSBs.

However, a number of Li-S batteries currently reported suffer from severe drawbacks such as the insulating nature of sulfur, sluggish redox kinetics, and the shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides. To overcome these challenges, herein, carbonyl group functionalized porous carbon nanofibers assembled with nickel (Ni/PCNFO) are proposed to serve as an efficient sulfur host in Li-S batteries. Such a Ni/PCNFO-S composite cathode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performances, which are attributed to three factors: (1) the large inner space of the PCNF can afford a high S content and accommodate the volume expansion; (2) high electrical conductivity is provided by the carbon nanofiber skeleton and the electrocatalytically active Ni species embedded in the PCNF significantly facilitate the redox kinetics of the S species; and (3) the carbonyl group anchored on the Ni/PCNF can effectively suppress the polysulfide effect via strong chemical affinity/adsorption with polysulfides. With these advantageous features, the Li-S batteries based on Ni/PCNFO-S cathodes exhibit a high specific capacity (1320 mA h g(-1)), excellent rate capability (780 mA h g(-1)), and long cycling stability (910 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.2C).

However, the rapid capacity degradation, mainly caused by polysulfide dissolution, remains a significant challenge prior to practical applications. In this work, a sulfur cathode modified by bifunctional nafion/gamma-Al2O3 membrane has been successfully prepared, which can remarkably immobilize the polysulfides within the unique cathode structure due to its ions selectivity and absorbent capacity. A high initial discharge capacity of 1448.0 mAh g(-1) can be achieved at 1C and 788.6 mAh g(-1) preserved after 200 cycles, indicating a slow degradation. Furthermore, the coulombic efficiency maintains as high as 97% during cycling. The excellent electrochemical properties can be attributed to the bifunctional and stable membrane which can dramatically reduce the shuttle effect and keep integrated even after charging-discharging for 200 cycles.

Li-S batteries have been attracted increasing attention owing to the high theoretical capacity of element sulfur (S, 1672 mAh g(-1)). Nevertheless, the insulation nature of the S element and polysulfide shuttle effect, resulting in low S utilization and poor cycling stability, are the main obstacles to widespread practical utilization of Li-S batteries. To tackle these issues, a well-designed hybrid cathode, consisted of S-infused activated carbon fiber (ACF) cloth and a thin TiO2 wrapping layer (TiO2-ACF/S), is developed in this work with the TiO2 wrapping layer as a polysulfide chemisorption layer, while the ACF cloth being a conductive network. Compared to the pure S and ACF/S cathodes, the TiO2-ACF/S hybrid cathode, with a high S loading of about 3.0 mg cm(-2), displays an improved initial specific capacity (915 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C), cycle stability (capacity retention of 77% after 100 cycles, 702 mAh g(-1)), and rate ability (438 mAh g(-1) at 5C). The enhanced electrochemical performances of TiO2-ACF/S hybrid cathode are attributed to the synergistic effects from TiO2 (polysulfide chemisorption material), ACF (electronically conductive material) and S (high hosting capacity of Li ions).

In spite of the intrinsic advantages, Li-S batteries currently are confronted with a variety of problems such as low specific capacity and short cycle life. In this work, a novel sulfur/carbon composite was prepared using coconut shell carbon as raw material for Li-S batteries. The structure of the composite could accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur particles and trap the dissolved polysulfide produced during the electrochemical reaction. Therefore, the composite based cell demonstrates a high initial capacity of 878 mA h g(-1) at a rate of 0.1 C, and excellent cycling stability, in which a reversible capacity of 774 mA h g(-1) was maintained even after 50 cycles.

J	Deng, T; Men, XL; Jiao, XC; Wang, J				Deng, Teng; Men, Xin-Liang; Jiao, Xue-Chao; Wang, Juan			CNTs decorated Cu-BTC with catalytic effect for high-stability lithium-sulfur batteries	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Li-S batteries; Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs); Carbon nanotubes (CNTs); Catalytic effect; Long cycle stability	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDE; SEPARATOR; HOST; COMPOSITE; ELECTRODE; SULFIDE; SITES	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have received widespread attention for the reason that their specific capacity is dramatically higher than that of current lithium-ion batteries. However, Li-S batteries still have problems such as poor conductivity, severe "shuttle effect", huge volume changes in the cathode, and lithium dendrites. Here, we report the introduction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-Cu-BTC and obtained Cu-BTC/CNTs with a three-dimensional structure by hydrothermal method. This structure solves the problem of inefficient electrochemical performance caused by poor conductivity when using Cu-BTC to adsorb lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). At the same time, the abundant porous structure is capable of effectively alleviating the volume expansion of the cathode during the reaction process. More importantly, Cu-BTC/CNTs catalyzes redox reactions, greatly improves the catalytic effect of Cu-BTC on LiPSs and the utilization of sulfur. As a result, The Cu-BTC/CNTs/S as sulfur host in the Li-S batteries cathode delivers an initial discharge of 924.69 mAh/g at 0.2C. Even at a high rate of 1C, it also exhibits a specific capacity of 805.28 mAh/g and still maintains 406.68mAh/g after 200 cycles at 1C. The above results indicate that the introduction of CNTs not only improves the overall conductivity of the material but also can fully exert the catalytic effect of Cu-BTC on the conversion of LiPSs. This work provides a convenient strategy to promote the conversion of LiPSs along with improving the catalytic activity of MOFs in Li-S batteries.

The importance of the dissolution of polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries and a perspective on high-energy electrolyte/cathode design	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Energy storage; Lithium-sulfur battery; Shuttle effect; Polysulfide confinement	COMPOSITE CATHODE MATERIALS; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; MEMBRANE	The dissolution of polysulfides is widely considered to be a major obstacle for developing lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) because it results in a shuttle effect. A popular strategy to address this issue is prevent -ing polysulfide dissolution, e.g., trapping/confining polysulfides in porous carbons. However, this conflicts with the advantage of commonly used ether-based electrolytes, i.e., the dissolution of polysulfides in such electrolytes is beneficial for delivering Li + to sulfur-based species compared to sluggish solid-state trans-port. Thus, a question is raised on the feasibility of the strategy to prevent polysulfide dissolution. Here, it is shown that the dissolution of polysulfides in ether-based electrolytes is necessary for a high capacity, suggesting that it might not be right to prevent the dissolution of polysulfides in such electrolytes. Thus, other approaches should be developed. A perspective is hence provided for designing electrolyte/cathode for high-energy LSBs. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, their practical applications are seriously limited by low utilization of active materials, rapid capacity attenuation, and poor rate performance. Herein, porous reduced graphene oxide and sulfur hybrid aerogel (RGA@S) cathode materials with various sulfur loadings (4.2 to 22.2 mg cm(-2)) have been designed and fabricated with a facile assembly strategy for Li-S batteries. Benefitting from the highly uniform distribution of sulfur, an ultrahigh mass specific capacitance (1386 mA h g(-1)) and a superior areal specific capacitance of 25.86 (mA h cm(-2)) were achieved. In addition, with the employment of the stable interconnected porous structure of RGA@S electrodes, the redox reaction kinetics were efficiently modified, resulting in an improved rate performance. More importantly, the plentiful free spaces in RGA@S electrodes facilitate the adsorption of intermediate polysulfides within the cathode, realizing a long cycle life Li-S battery with an ultralow capacity fading upon 2000 cycles (0.013% per cycle).

The Li-S cell equipped with WN0.67@NG modified polypropylene (PP) separator exhibits outstanding electrochemical performances: a long-term stability with only a capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle over 200 cycles and a large capacity of 725 mAh g(-1) at 4C; interestingly, a favorable capacity of 776 mAh g(-1) can be maintained after 100 cycles at 0.2C for assembled Li-S pouch cell under a high sulfur loading conditions of 4.3 mg cm(-2) with lean electrolyte occupation (6 mu L mg(-1)). The outstanding performance can be attributed to the following advantages of WN0.67@NG interlayer: the high conductivity of NG sheets can facilitate the electron transfer and act as a physical block for restricting the LiPSs shuttle; most importantly, the polar WN0.67 nanoneedles embedded on the NG sheets not only provide abundant active sites for chemisorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs, but also contribute to the nucleation and growth of Li2S; further theoretical calculations and in-situ Raman spectra clearly reveal the adsorption and catalytic conversion mechanism of WN0.67@NG interlayer at the molecular level. The work provides new insight into rational design and facile fabrication of multifunctional separators for industrial applications in high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, a facile strategy is demonstrated to prepare 3-dimensional hierarchical porous nitrogen doped graphene as a sulfur host material for lithium sulfur battery, where urea is employed as both nitrogen doping source and self-removed template for pore structure optimization. The resultant material possesses high nitrogen doping content, 3-dimentional interconnected hierarchical porosity and conductive network and robust mechanical structure, which give rise to a comprehensive ability for multiscale electron/ion transfer, sulfur accommodation and polysulfides confining. Benefiting from the rational structure design, the sulfur loaded composite exhibits high sulfur utilization (1311mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C), high rate capability (950, 762 and 580 mA h g(-1) at 1, 2 and 3 C respectively) and excellent cycling stability with high sulfur mass loading (714 mA h g(-1) at 1.5mA cm(-2) after 400 cycles for a sulfur loading of 4mg cm(-2)). The outstanding electrochemical performance, scalable fabrication process, and compatibility with industrial slurry-coating process makes it an ideal host material for practical application of lithium sulfur battery.

However, the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides and poor reaction kinetics severely impede the commercial application. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) multi-functional C@SnS2 compound material is designed for PP separator modification. Chemical etching is skillfully used to construct evenly distributed vacancies and activated carbon sites from ZIF-67 in one step, which is beneficial to the uniform growth of SnS2 subsequently. The C@SnS2 shows a synergic effect between porous carbon matrix and polar SnS2 due to the unique structure, combining electrochemical kinetics and anchoring-catalytic-conversion of polysulfides. Therefore, excellent long-term cycling performance (646 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C, the loss rate of 0.062% per cycle) and outstanding rate capacity (793 mAh g(-1) at 2 C) are obtained. This work provides an effective attempt to inhibit the shuttle effect and improve the kinetic process in Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we report room temperature all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries using thin sulfur layer-embedded FeS2 (FeS2@S) microsphere composites as active materials in the FeS2@S-Li10GeP2S12-Super P cathode electrode. Setting the cut-off voltage between 1.5 and 2.8 V, only lithiation-delithiation reactions between L2FeS2 and FeSy and direct reaction between Li2S and S will occur, which avoids large volume change of FeS2 caused by the conversion reaction, leading to the structure integrity of FeS2@S. The resultant batteries exhibit excellent rate and cyclic performances, delivering specific capacities of 1120.9, 937.2, 639.7, 517.2, 361.5, and 307.0 mA h g(-1) for the FeS2@S composite cathode, corresponding to the normalized capacities of 1645.5, 1252.9, 782.5, 700.2, 478.4, and 363.6 mA h g(-1) for sulfur at 30, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 mA g-1, respectively. Besides, they can retain the normalized capacity of 430.7 mA h g(-1) for sulfur at 1000 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles at room temperature.

However, high sulfur loading, especially at a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S), usually causes low sulfur utilization, mainly caused by the slow redox kinetics of polysulfides and the passivation of the discharge product, poor electrically/ionically conducting Li2S. Herein, by using cobalt-based metal organic frameworks (Co-MOFs) as precursors, a Co, N-doped carbonaceous composite (Co, N-CNTs (carbon nanotubes)-CNS (carbon nanosheet)/CFC (carbon fiber cloth)) is fabricated with hierarchically ordered structure, which consists of a free-standing 3D carbon fiber skeleton decorated with a vertical 2D carbon nanosheets array rooted by interwoven 1D CNTs. As an effective polysulfides host, the hierarchically ordered 3D conductive network with abundant active sites and voids can effectively trap polysulfides and provide fast electron/ions pathways to convert them. In addition, Co and N heteroatoms can strengthen the interaction with polysulfides and accelerate its reaction kinetics. More importantly, the interwoven CNTs with Co, N-doping can induce 3D Li2S deposition instead of conventional 2D deposition, which benefits improving sulfur utilization. Therefore, for Co, N-CNTs-CNS/CFC electrodes, even at a high sulfur loading of 10.20 mg cm(-2) with a low E/S of 6.94, a high reversible areal capacity of 7.42 mAh cm(-2) can be achieved with excellent cycling stability.

In this work,N-bromophthalimide (C8H4NO2Br, NBP), an aromatic molecule with carbophilic, sulfiphilic, lithiophilic, and solvophilic nature, is introduced into active graphene (AG) to fabricate the sulfur composite cathode. The carbophilic NBP is anchored readily on the AG surfacevia pi-pi stacking interaction. During discharging, the dissolved lithium polysulfide anion (LiSn-) is grafted into the sulfiphilic NBP spontaneouslyviaS(N)2 substitution reaction to form C8H4NO2SnLi, which brings the dissolved LiSn-back to the AG surface in the composite cathode. Moreover, the lithiophilic and solvophilic nature of NBP improve the wettability of the porous composite cathode, and the electrolyte molecule is easily penetrated into the micro-mesopores of AG to facilitate the diffusion of the electrolyte. Thus, NBP, as a multi-functional compound in Li-S battery, can immobilize LiSn-and enhance the diffusion of the electrolyte. The above features of NBP endow the sulfur composite cathode with improved electrochemical performance in the cycling stability.

J	Cheng, XB; Huang, JQ; Zhang, Q				Cheng, Xin-Bing; Huang, Jia-Qi; Zhang, Qiang			Review-Li Metal Anode in Working Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Li-SM3 Conference	APR 26-27, 2017	London, ENGLAND				SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES; POLYMER ELECTROLYTE; CURRENT COLLECTORS; NANOWIRE NETWORK; GRAPHENE OXIDE; STABLE HOST; S CELLS; PERFORMANCE; SURFACE	Due to the high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh kg(-1), lithium-sulfur batteries are strongly regarded as the promising next-generation energy storage devices. However, the practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries are challenged by several obstacles, including the low sulfur utilization and poor lifespan, which are partly attributed to the shuttle of lithium polysulfides and lithium dendrite growth in working lithium-sulfur batteries. Suppressing lithium dendrite growth is a necessary step not only for a safe and efficient Li metal anode, but also for a high capacity cell with a high Coulombic efficiency. Herein we review the lithium metal anode protection in a polysulfide-rich environment, relative to most reviews on lithium metal anode without considering the effect of lithium polysulfides in lithium metal batteries. Firstly, the importance and dilemma of Li metal anode issues in lithium-sulfur batteries are underscored, aiming to arouse the attentions to Li metal anode protection. Specific attentions are paid to the surface chemistry of Li metal anode in a polysulfide-rich lithium-sulfur battery. Next, the proposed strategies to stabilize solid electrolyte interface and protect Li metal anode are included. Finally, a general conclusion and a perspective on the current limitations, as well as recommended future research directions of Li metal anode in lithium-sulfur batteries are presented.

One separator was one-side coated with MoS2 towards anode, and the other separator was double-side coated with AC and MoS2 (AC-MoS2) towards cathode and anode respectively. These slurries of AC and MoS2 have the high specific surface area and porous structure, moreover, MoS2 has a highly 'catalyst' effect on sulfide conversion by virtue of its high electrochemical activity as well as strong binding energy with soluble lithium polysulfides. Assembled Li-S batteries with separators coated by AC-MoS2, MoS2 and uncoated separator show the initial discharged specific capacities of 1318 mAh g(-1) and 1257 mAh g(-1) and 957 mAh g(-1) respectively, and those of 719 mAh g(-1), 548 mAh g(-1) and 306 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at 0.2 C rate, with the coulombic efficiency remains over 98%. At the same time, the morphology of the separator coated by AC-MoS2 after 200 cycles exhibits a homogeneous sulfur distribution. This coating technology on the separator provides a facile and efficient route to obtain the superior Li-S battery.

Herein, we report a multifunctional pomegranate-like porous carbon nanofibers with LaF3 doped (La@PCNFs) by electro-blowing spinning technique and subsequent one-step carbonization process for high stability Li-S battery. Interestingly, a number of hollow and mesoporous carbon grains with high graphitization evenly and densely grow inside the macroporous carbon skeleton, which can construct a fast and hierarchical transfer channel and largely enrich the exposed active sites. More importantly, the polar interfaces decorated with active ionic C-F and LaF3 nanocrystal have strong trapping to the lithium polysulfide during cycles. Therefore, the La@PCNFs cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 640 mAh.g(-1) and a low average capacity decay of 0.05% during 1000 cycles at 5 C, which will shed some lights on the development of other biomimetic materials for various energy conversion and storage systems.

With this strategy, the volume expansion and aggregation of sulfur nanoparticles can be effectively mitigated, thus enabling high sulfur utilization and improving the specific capacity and cycling stability of the electrode. Modification of the TiO2-S nanocomposites with graphene can trap the polysulfides via chemisorption and increase the electronic connection among various components.

As compared with the pristine Co-N-C, the intercalated CNTs can lead to significant enhancements of specific surface area, sulfur loading and electroconductivity, thus pronouncedly improving the overall Li-S battery performance. More specifically, the Co-N-C/CNTs/S cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1440.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C while 1104.4 mA h g(-1) for Co-N-C/S. At 1C, the capacity decay rate of Co-N-C/CNTs/S is 0.09% per cycle after 500 cycles with the coulombic efficiency more than 98.2%, while 0.14% per cycle with the coulombic efficiency of 96.4% for Co-N-C/S. Evidently, the interpenetration of CNTs into the sulfur host materials is a simple and effective strategy to promote the Li-S battery performance.

The MGC is synthesized via the simultaneous activation and graphitization of peanut shell char promoted by K2FeO4, which possesses ultra-micropore (pore width <0.7 nm) volume as high as 0.65 cm(3) g(-1) and the predominant pore width less than 0.4 nm. After sulfur infusion, the S/MGC composite with 50.5 wt% sulfur loading exhibits superior long-term cycling stability and rate performance in S/MGC vertical bar Li full cell. The cell delivers high capacity of 1146 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 570 mAh g(-1) even at 4 C. Moreover, the capacities of 826 and 571 mAh g(-1) remain after 1000 cycles at 1 C and 2 C, respectively. In addition, the cell exhibits good storage property. The well confined S2-4 inside the interconnected ultra-micropores with graphitic carbon walls endows the S/MGC composite with good electronic conductivity and stability, while unoccupied pores within the S/MGC facilitate fast Lithorn transport and kinetics of electrochemical reactions.

Ultra-thin 2D MoO2 nanosheets (MoO2 NSs) have been synthesized by chemical vapor deposition and then mixed with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using as coating materials of the Celgard 2400 polypropylene separator to solve these problems. The 2D character of MoO2 NSs produced high surface/volume ratios and abundant active binding sites for anchoring LiPSs. In addition, the partial reduction of MoO2 NSs in a H-2/Ar mixture introduced oxygen vacancies in their surface, which acted as catalytic sites for LiPS conversion, while the CNT network ensured rapid electron transfer for LiPS conversion reactions. Symmetric dummy cell tests showed that a 30wt%MoO2/CNT coated separator reduced the energy barrier for Li2S nucleation, and first-principles calculations verified its strong binding energy to entrap LiPSs and increase Li2S precipitation. Because of these features, a cell with a 30wt%MoO2/CNT coated separator had an improved specific capacity of 738 mAh.g(-1) at 1 C with a slow decay rate of 0.053% for 800 cycles.

However, sluggish redox kinetics and the shuttle effect of polysulfides in the cyclic process lead to low sulfur utilization, severe polarization and poor cyclic stability. Herein, an SnS modified porous carbon nanosheet (SnS/PCNS) hybrid material is synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and used to modify the separator of the LSB for the first time. Specifically, SnS/PCNS can not only adsorb polysulfides, but also enhance the redox reaction of polysulfides. In addition, SnS/PCNS are shown to promote rapid nucleation and uniform deposition of Li2S, and to improve the discharge capacity and heighten cyclic stability. The initial capacity is 1270 mAh g(-1)at 0.5 C, the slow decay rate of each cycle is 0.039% at 1 C. When the sulfur loading is improved to 6 mg cm(-2), the high reversible capacity is 955.3 mAh g(-1)at 0.5 C. As a new polysulfides adsorbent, SnS provides a potential route for the commercialization of LSBs.

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) hollow heterostructure, con-structed by reduced graphene oxide coated hollow TiO2 microspheres (noted as H-TiO2@rGO heterostructures), is developed as progressive host-interlayer integrated electrodes for Li-S batteries. It is noteworthy that the hollow TiO(2 )microspheres provide a applicable space for loading and trapping sulfur nanoparticles, and the shell formed by TiO2 particles ensures enrichment of catalytic active sites, thus effectively trapping and promoting the transformation of soluble polysulfides. The elastic rGO layer can greatly promote the electrical conductivity of S host, as well as to significantly buffer volume expansion during charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the H-TiO2@rGO heterostructures modified integrated electrode can effectively improve the diffusion of lithium ions while preventing the shuttle effect due to the excellent trapping effect to polysulfides and the presence of continuous shell with holes composed of TiO2 small particles. Therefore, the rational designed host-interlayer integrated electrode of H-TiO2@rGO heterostructures not only confine the sulfur/polysulfides in 3D hollow microspheres, but also achieve catalytic transition of the polysulfides dissolved in electrolyte to solid Li2S2/Li2S, both of which synergistically achieves an extremely fading rate of 0.025% per cycle over 1000 times at 1C. The H-TiO2@rGO heterostructures proposed in this paper may supply a fresh idea for the fine design of Li-S battery integrated electrodes.

After fluorination of graphitized MWCNTs, F-WMCNTs with a core-shell structure (fluorocarbon atomic ratio C/F = 1:1) can be obtained. The surface of F-WMCNTs was fluorinated to form a fluorinated carbon structure, while the internal structure of the original MWCNTs remains. F-MWCNTs/MWCNTs and cellulose fibers form a 3D crosslinked network structure, which effectively captures polysulfides. This layer was confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The F-MWCNTs interlayer Li-S battery maintained specific capacities of 1026 mAh/g, 938 mAh/g, and 764 mAh/g at 1C, 2C, and 3C, respectively, showing excellent rate performance.

In this work, the beneficial effect of copper sulfide for enabling high areal capacity lithium-sulfur all-solid-state batteries is shown. Copper sulfide-carbon (CuSC) and three different copper sulfide-sulfur-carbon (CuSS) composites are investigated as positive electrodes in all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries. The composites are prepared via facile and low-cost mechanochemical ball-milling. It is found that the CuS/C ratio greatly influences the redox properties of the CuSC cathode. Scanning electron microscopy, ex-situ X-ray diffraction, and galvanostatic cycling were also conducted to evaluate the CuSS composite electrodes in Li vertical bar LiI-Li3PS4 vertical bar CuS-S-C solid-state cells. High mass loading cells made using these composite electrodes deliver capacities as high as 1600 mAh g((CuS+S))(-1) and 7 mAh cm(-2) at 20 degrees C. The higher density of CuS also leads to larger volumetric capacities, up to 3900 mAh cm((CuS+S))(-3), thus enabling a potential energy density gain up to 15% with respect to a conventional Carbon-Sulfur cathode.

To overcome this problem for achieving long cycle life and high rate performance, anchoring materials are highly desirable. In this work, for the first time, we explore the anchoring behaviors of polysulfides on C3B and C3N monolayers with reference to pristine graphene by using density functional theory computations. The complicated anchoring mechanisms are further explored by analyzing the competition between van der Waals, electrostatic, and chemical interactions. Our results suggest that C3B monolayer shows the best anchoring performance for lithium polysulfides due to the strong chemical interaction induced by charge transfer while C3N monolayer has relative weak anchoring effect due to the electrostatic interaction. Based on the enhanced conductivity, strong anchoring ability, and improved rate capability, C3B monolayer shows the promise as an anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this work, a composite of organically modified carbon nanotube (CNT) and zirconia (ZrO2) nanoparticles is synthesized and used as a surface coating on a commercial Celgard separator to restrain the shuttle effect and improve battery performance. Electrolyte uptake and water contact angle measurements show that the CNT/ZrO2 composite-coated separator has an enhanced electrolyte wettability. Thermal shrinkage results reveal an improvement in the stability of the coated separators, especially at high temperatures. Electrochemical measurements also show the effectiveness of the CNT/ZrO2 composite-coated separator in a Li-S battery. The initial discharge capacity is improved after coating, as is the capacity retention rate. In addition, a battery with a CNT/ZrO2 composite-coated separator attains an impressive capacity reversibility as high as 91.7% in a rate performance test from 0.1 to 2 C. The composite coating restrains the shuttle effect effectively and improves the thermal shrinkage properties of the separator. Thus, the use of a CNT/ZrO2 composite-coated separator should improve the prospects for practical application of Li-S batteries. (c) 2018 Author(s).

However, security issues have become a major challenge in practical applications. Both lithium-ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries have safety problems that need to be solved. Herein, a polymer electrolyte suitable for the two types of batteries was easily synthesized. A polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)-based polymer electrolyte with 1-butyl-1-methyl pyrrolidine bis-trifluoromethyl sulfonimide (Py14TFSI) was used as the solid electrolyte. The ionic conductivity of the LiTFSI/Py14TFSI/cellulose acetate (CA)/PVDF polymer electrolyte was 1.45 x 10(-4) S cm(-1). The electrochemical stability window was 4.95 V. The transference number of the lithium ion was 0.231. The constant-current polarization test results showed that the polarization voltage was only 0.04 V when the current density was 1 mA cm(-2). The first discharge specific capacity of the Li vertical bar LiTFSI/Py14TFSI/CA/PVDF vertical bar LiFePO4 battery was 125.7 mA h g(-1) (0.5 C), and the capacity retention rate was 95.22% after 50 cycles at room temperature. A multistage porous conductive carbon (M-PCC) material with micropores and mesopores was applied as the host of the sulfur cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries. The M-PCC material provided a carrier for sulfur and sulfide with a specific surface area of 1132.68 m(2) g(-1). The solid-state lithium-sulfur battery (Li vertical bar LiTFSI/Py14TFSI/CA/PVDF vertical bar S@M-PCC) had excellent electrochemical performance. The first discharge specific capacity was 1245.9 mA h g(-1) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 97.34%. The energy of Py14TFSI cation and Li2S8 calculated by DFT was 8.8345 eV, which indicated that the polysulfide cannot adsorb onto the polymer electrolyte. XPS was used to measure the elemental composition of the anode-electrolyte interface after charge-discharge cycling. The uniform growth of lithium dendrite was observed by the SEM image of the anode after cycles. The results showed that a solid-state lithium-sulfur battery produced uniform solid electrolyte interface films and completely suppressed the shuttle effect.

The major challenges associated with high sulfur loading electrodes are poor material utilization caused via the nonconductivity of the charged product (S) and the discharged product (Li2S), poor stability arisen from dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) into most organic electrolytes and pulverization, and structural damage of the electrode caused by large volumetric expansion. A multifunctional synergistic composite enables ultrahigh sulfur content for advanced LSBs, which comprises the sulfur particle encapsulated with an ion-selective polymer with conductive carbon nanotubes and dispersed around Magneli phase Ti4O7 (MS-3) by the bottom-up method. The ion-selective polymer provides a physical shield and electrostatic repulsion against the shuttling of polysulfides with negative charge, whereas it can permit the transmission of lithium ion (Li+) through the polymer membrane, and the carbon nanotubes twined around the sulfur promote electronic conductivity and sulfur utilization as well as strong chemical adsorption of LiPSs by means of Ti4O7. Because of this hierarchical construction, the cathode possesses a lofty final sulfur loading of 72% and large sulfur areal mass loading of 3.56 mg cm(-2), which displays the large areal specific capacity of 4.22 mA h cm(-2). In the same time, it can provide excellent cyclic performance with the corresponding capacity attenuation ratio of 0.08% per cycle at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. Especially, while sulfur areal mass loading is sharply enhanced to 5.11 mg cm(-2), the MS-3 composite exhibits a large initial areal capacity of 5.04 mA h cm(-2) and still keeps a high reversible capacity of 696 mA h g(-1) at 300th cycle even at a 1.0 C. The design of high sulfur content cathodes is a viable approach for boosting practical commercialized application of LSBs.

In our work, the mixture of acetylene black and multiwalled carbon nanotubes is uniformly applied onto the commercial polypropylene membranes to attain the modified separators. While investigating different samples, the underlying influence of the coating layer is systematically scrutinized on the electrochemical behaviors of sulfur cathodes, relying on the extensive electrochemical and structural measurements. During the charge/discharge process, the coating layer can function as the second current collector and drastically contribute to the improved lithium ions diffusion, determining the electrochemical kinetics of sulfur-involved reactions. Moreover, it is found that the thicker the layer, the faster the lithium ions diffuse. It should be noted that the coating layer also plays a role of the second sulfur reservoir to endow the ample active sites for sulfur and polysulfides, which is directly witnessed for the first time. Because of the positiveness and effectiveness of the modified layer on separators, the sulfur cathode can offer the superior cycling and rate performance to that with the original separator.

Herein, we report an ideal core-shell sulfur host material based on core-shell carbon encapsulated multi-chambered carbon nanospheres (MCCN@C) for Li-S batteries. The hierarchical and micro-mesoporous core in MCCN@C can allow a high sulfur loading (83.1 wt%) and serve as the physical barrier to block the polysulfide dissolution, and the carbon shell can provide additional physical confinements for improving the retention of soluble polysulfides. Moreover, the well-designed conductive networks of the MCCN@C material interconnected by carbon chambers can promote fast electron transfer and electrolyte penetration. In Li-S batteries, MCCN-S@C composite cathodes deliver significantly enhanced electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 1163 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles, remarkable rate capability (626 mA h g(-1) at 5.0C) and ultrahigh long-term cycle stability at high rates (651 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 2.0C with 0.032% capacity decay per cycle). More importantly, the MCCN@C-S composite cathode with 3.6 mg cm(-2) sulfur also delivers a high and stable electrochemical performance over 200 cycles.

J	Zhang, XY; Zhou, HY; Wang, JG				Zhang, Xingyuan; Zhou, Hanyuan; Wang, Jian-Gan			Nitrogen-rich microporous carbon framework as an efficient polysulfide host for lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							CATHODE; NANOSPHERES; IMMOBILIZER; MATRIX	Lithium-sulfur batteries are recognized as a promising high-energy-density and low-cost energy storage devices. However, the sulfur cathode suffers from poor cycling stability resulting from the serious polysulfide shuttle. Herein, we develop a nitrogen-rich and highly porous carbon polyhedron for effectively hosting sulfur. The carbon host manifests an ultrahigh specific surface area of 3400 m(2) g(-1), a dominated micropore volume of 0.96 cm(3) g(-1), and a high-level nitrogen doping of 8.3 at.%. Such an intriguing structure could suppress the polysulfide shuttle via physical confinement by micropores and strong chemical adsorption by polar nitrogen species. Moreover, the electrically conductive carbon enables a substantially enhanced electrochemical kinetics. Consequently, the carbon/sulfur composite electrode delivers an ultralow fading rate of 0.033% per cycle at 2 C over 500 cycles and superior rate capability (483 mAh g(-1)at a high 5 C rate). The present study demonstrates the potential use of nitrogen-rich porous carbon framework as an efficient polysulfide host for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Two-dimensional (2D) MXene materials can immobilize polysulfides via strong chemisorption and physical hinderance. However, MXene nanosheets tend to restack in solution, losing their favorable electronic conductivity due to functional substituents on the surface. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) MXene material is fabricated with MXene nanosheets and carbon-poly (diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) nanoparticles using self-assembly strategy. As the sulfur host, the 3D material not only prevents MXene nanosheets from restacking, but also ensures to provide a framework to confine S and raises the utilization of sulfur. As a result, the sulfur cathode demonstrates a highly reversible specific capacity of 1016.8 mAh g -1 at 0.2 C, excellent rate capability, and long-term cycling stability, with the capacity decay rate of only 0.075% per cycle over 600 cycles at 1 C.

Here, inspired by a plant, philodendron hederaceum, a hierarchically structured 3D graphene nanostructure composed of vertically aligned porous graphene nanosheets and interconnected nanocages (denoted as PHG) is designed and prepared by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method in a fluidized-bed reactor. Compared to in-plane graphene, the hierarchical pores of PHG facilitate the infiltration of electrolyte and transport of ions as well as improve the charge storage capability. The integrated conductive networks of the graphene nanoarchitecture accelerate the transportation of electrons, and the in situ-formed connections between the units of the nanocages are robust for durable electrochemical properties. When used as anode materials of lithium-ion batteries, the PHG exhibits a reversible capacity of 1560 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), more importantly, high-rate capacities (160 mAh g(-1) at 4 A g(-1)), and stable cycling performance. Moreover, for lithium-sulfur batteries, this hierarchically structured 3D graphene could be loaded with sulfur at a higher mass loading, which delivers high specific capacity (1640 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), and maintains stable performance. Considering the structural properties, as-prepared 3D graphene will have a wide range of applications in energy storage.

However, sluggish conversion kinetics and the notorious shuttle effect of the polysulfides present in sulfur cathodes hinder the practical use of Li-S batteries. Herein, an electrocatalytic sulfur host with a two-dimensional (2D) sandwich structure is synthesized and found to display excellent properties for overcoming the noted challenges. The electrocatalytic sulfur host is prepared by covalently grafting a conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) to MXene nanosheets and denoted as CMP-M. The CMP component features triazine and benzothiophene units and thus the constituent heteroatoms endow CMP-M with a plethora of chemisorption sites to capture various polysulfides. The MXene component provides an electrocatalytic template to construct the 2D sandwich composite and can facilitate charge transfer while accelerating polysulfide conversion. Li-S cells prepared using CMP-M as sulfur hosts are found to exhibit a number of outstanding performance metrics including a high specific capacity (i.e., 1402 mA h g-1 at 0.1C), an outstanding rate capability (i.e., 610 mA h g(-1) at 4C), and a low capacity decay (from an initial value of 730 to 550 after 1000 cycles at 2C, corresponding to 0.025% per cycle). The methodology presented herein offers a universal approach for constructing electrocatalytic 2D composites that are useful not only in Li-S batteries but also in other contemporary energy technologies.

Here, we realize a novel "solid -> solid" cathode mode for LSBs via a transplantable solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The SEI is in situ formed in a carbonate-based electrolyte with high-concentration dualsalt during the initial discharge process. The solid -> solid cathode process does not involve any dissolution of the intermediates; hence, the "shuttle effect" can be totally eliminated. Furthermore, the SEI shows a high electrolyte compatibility and can be transplanted to the conventional carbonate-based/ether-based electrolytes. The sulfur/carbon composite with 65% sulfur a reversible specific capacity of 1009 mA h g(-1) and negligible self-discharge. The SEI strategy can successfully break the limitation from the traditional "catholyte" electrode mechanism. Meanwhile, it provides large flexibility for designing high-loading carbon hosts and selecting an electrolyte for high-performance LSBs.

Galvanostatic cycling at different C-rates with and without an electrolyte additive and cyclic voltammetry were used to probe the electrochemical performance of the cells with the PP-g-PLiSS separators and to compare it with the performance of the cells utilizing state-of-the-art separator, Celgard 2400. Overall, it was found that regardless of the applied cycling rate, the use of the grafted separators greatly enhances the Coulombic efficiency of the cell. An appropriate Li-exchange-site (-SO3-) concentration at and near the surface of the separator was found to be essential to effectively suppress the polysulfide shuttle without sacrificing the Li-ion mobility through the separator and to improve the practical specific charge of the cell.

The highly porous cathode is fabricated by using self-assembled nanostructured block copolymer as template. The block copolymer template is formed via phase inversion route followed by filling the empty spaces by oligomeric phenolic resin, thermopolymerization of the resin, and finally by carbonization. Semi-gelled film of self-assembled block copolymer is immersed in solution of nonsolvent mixture. After washing away of low molecular additive, a highly porous mat is generated. After successful filling with carbon precursor inside the template, crosslinking and carbonization under inert atmosphere result in a highly porous carbon material, which is further hybridized with sulfur via melt diffusion of elemental sulfur. This new fabrication route of template formation by phase inversion requires no solvent/thermal annealing step to generate nanostructure aided by block copolymer. The cathode material shows excellent cycle stability over 240 charging-discharging cycles, rate handling over 100 cycles.

However, rapid capacity fade and low sulfur content caused by the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the low conductivity of sulfur hinder the practical applications of Li-S batteries. In this regard, we synthesized metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived Co9S8/C hollow polyhedra grown on three-dimensional graphene aerogel (3D GA) as an efficient sulfur host material. The highly porous, conductive and freestanding 3D GA framework enables high sulfur content (77.3 wt%). The polar Co9S8/C provides strong chemical binding to immobilize polysulfides, and suppress the shuttling effect. Significantly, the Co9S8/ C/GA/S cathode exhibits excellent long cycling stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.0473% per cycle over 400 cycles. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although carbonaceous materials can improve the sulfur content and sulfur loading, the addition of binders and conductive agents limits the increase in energy density to a great extent. Here, carbon-free titanium nitride nanobelt (TiN-NB) thin films with flexible, conductive, hierarchically porous, and free-standing structures have been successfully developed to construct high-sulfur-loading and high-energy-density sulfur electrodes. In addition, macroscopically intertwined 3D nanobelt networks can provide an effective transport path for lithium ions and electrons, and a microscopically high specific surface area and porosity provide a necessary guarantee for the adsorption and catalytic transformation of polysulfides. At a sulfur loading of 1.0 mg cm(-2), the TiN-900@aS electrode delivers an initial capacity of 1436.7 mAh g(-1). After 150 cycles, the reversible capacity still remains at 1032.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C. Precisely, at a high sulfur loading of 7.1 mg cm(-2), the discharge capacity of the TiN-900gs electrode is maintained at 403.1 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1C.

However, "shuttle effect" and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides impede its practical application. Herein, a novel g-C3N4/Co-based MOFs derived chestnutlike superstructure (Co/CNT@DCNS) was prepared to act as the component of interlayer through a low-temperature one-step carbonization strategy. The prepared superstructure was constructed by the strong catalysis of OD Co nanoparticles, high conductivity of 1D CNTs and excellent polysulfides adsorption of 2D defect CxNy nanosheets, which could not only ensure the rapid electrons/ions transport and fast redox kinetics, but also provide sufficient spaces for accommodating the volume expansion of active materials. Therefore, the cells with the prepared interlayer exhibited stable performances with an initial capacity of 1348.3 mAhg(-1) and an extended cycling stability of 0.04% per cycle during the 1000 cycles at 1C. Even at a high sulfur loading of 3.1 mg cm(-2), a specific capacity of 691.7 mAh g(-1) can be maintained after 500 cycles at 0.5C. This work shares a convenient and safe strategy for the synthesis of multi-dimension, dual-functional and stable superstructure interlayer for advanced Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, the commercialized Li-S batteries is challenging owing to the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), poor electronic activity of sulfur and safety issues. In this work, flexible and binder-free 3D porous 1,3,5-triformylbenzene-tris(4-aminophenyl) amine (Tf-TAPA) covalent-organic framework (COF) derived N-doped carbon (CTT)/ 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) paper is designed as electronic conductive sulfur host to restrict the LiPSs. To boost the safety of Li-S batteries and further reduce the LiPSs diffusion, all-solid-state Li-S batteries are constructed by utilizing polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based solid electrolyte with low LiPSs solubility and high safety. With the synergistic advantages of porous and electronic conductive CTT, MXene and solid-state electrolyte, the all-solid-state Li-S batteries display excellent safety character and stable cycling stability about 584 mAh g-1 even after 100 cycles.

However, this approach focused only on the suppression of dissolved polysulfides on the cathodic side without considering the further entrapment of polysulfides on the anodic side. In this study, we first designed a multifunctional trilayer membrane comprising a carbon layer and a boron nitride (BN) layer to facilitate the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries and protect the Li anode from unexpected side reactions. When a BN-carbon separator was employed, the sulfur cathode delivered stable capacity retention over 250 cycles and an excellent specific capacity (702 mAh g(-1)) at a high current density (4 C). The BN-carbon separator also facilitated the uniform plating/striping of Li and, thus, suppressed the severe growth of dendritic Li on the electrode; this led to the stable operation of the Li anode with a high Coulombic efficiency and improved cycling performance.

Electrochemical catalysis, one effective method, promotes the reaction kinetics and inhibits the "shuttle effect". Here, we present a three-dimensional ordered macro-porous carbon with abundant cobalt-nitrogen-carbon active sites as a matrix catalyst, leading to accelerated polysulfide redox kinetics. In addition, the interconnected conductive frameworks with ordered macro-porous carbon afford fast ion/electron transport and provide sufficient space to adapt to the volume expansion of the sulfur electrode. Owing to the aforementioned advantages, a lithium-sulfur battery with the matrix catalyst delivers a high specific capacity (1140 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C) and a low capacity decay rate (0.0937% per cycle over 500 cycles). Moreover, there is a high rate capacity (349.1 mA h g(-1)) even at the high current density of 2C and sulfur loading of 3.8 mg cm(-2) due to the improved polysulfide redox kinetics by a catalytic effect.

However, their commercialization strongly depends on overcoming the shuttle effect caused by Li polysulfide species (LiPSs), the low utilization efficiency of active S material, and the uncontrolled growth of Li dendrites. Electrolytes can be the key to these issues and promote the reaction kinetics of Li-S batteries through electrolyte engineering. In this review, after introducing the development history and working mechanism of Li-S battery, advanced in-situ characterization techniques that facilitate insight into the underlying mechanism of Li-S batteries are discussed. Subsequently, various strategies for suppressing the shuttle effect of LiPSs are simply summarized. The role of LiPSs is thoroughly discussed and a comprehensive overview is provided, and the electrolyte engineering strategies for eliminating the dissolution of LiPSs and inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites in Li-S battery systems are focused. In addition, the controversy over suppressing versus promoting the dissolution of LiPSs to the bulk electrolyte is deeply discussed, and techniques and theoretical calculations for characterizing the solvation structure of Li+ ions are presented. Finally, prospects and personal perspectives are provided on electrolyte engineering as the future research directions for Li-S batteries.

J	Li, BY; Xiao, Q; Luo, YZ				Li, Buyin; Xiao, Qi; Luo, Yuanzheng			A modified synthesis process of three-dimensional sulfur/graphene aerogel as binder-free cathode for lithium sulfur batteries	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Graphene aerogel; Lithiumsulfur batteries; Cathode materials; Binder-free	SANDWICH STRUCTURE; COMPOSITE	Among the existing rechargeable battery systems, lithium sulfur batteries exhibit ultra-high theoretical specific capacity (1672mAh/g) and specific energy (2600 Wh/kg). However, its practical applications have been limited by several problems, especially the dissolution of lithium polysulfides and shuttle effect, which will cause poor cycling stability. Herein, we synthesized a 3D porous graphene aerogel through a modified two-step hydrothermal reduction method, which has been simultaneously used as the matrix to load sulfur and the shield to constrain the dissolution of polysulfides. The graphene aerogel containing sulfur was mechanically pressed to circular disc and directly used as cathode without any additives, which shows great flexibility and excellent electrical conductivity. Since no extra conductive additives and binder are needed, this binder-free method is also more facile than conventional processes. Meanwhile, the shield was used as lithium polysulfides absorber to suppress the shuttle effect. Compared with conventional lithium sulfur batteries, this novel cathode with unique battery structure enables a higher areal sulfur loading of >2.5mg/cm(2) and initial specific capacity of >1100mAh/g. More importantly, the dissolution and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides were suppressed effectively by the graphene aerogel matrix and shield, greatly improving the cycling stability.

SYNTHESIS OF CARBON NANOTUBES ON A SHUNGITE SUBSTRATE AND THEIR USE FOR LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING PHYSICS AND THERMOPHYSICS			English	Article						multiwalled carbon nanotubes; lithium-sulfur batteries; composite; CVD	CATHODE	A shungite mineral has been used as a support material of catalyst particles to synthesize multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Raman spectroscopy enabled us to follow the formation of MWCNTs. The morphology of synthesized MWCNTs was investigated by a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron microscope. As a result of simple heat treatment at 300 degrees C for 3 h in an inert atmosphere, a novel sulfur/multiwalled carbon nanotubes/polyacrylonitrile (S/MWCNT/PAN) composite was synthesized. These methods of obtaining MWCNTs and S/MWCNT/PAN composite based on heat treatment possess the advantages of simplicity and low cost. The introduction ofMWCNTs into the composite gives a highly conductive and mechanically flexible framework with an enhanced electronic conductivity and the ability to absorb polysulfides between the Li anode and cathode, which leads to an enhanced cyclability and a higher coulombic efficiency. The cell with this S/MWCNT/PAN ternary composite cathode demonstrates a stable reversible specific discharge capacity of 800 mA.h.g(-1) after 50 cycles at a battery C-rate of 0.2 C.

However, the multiphase sulfur redox reactions with sophisticated homogeneous and heterogeneous electrochemical processes are sluggish in kinetics, thus requiring targeted and high-efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a semi-immobilized molecular electrocatalyst is designed to tailor the characters of the sulfur redox reactions in working Li-S batteries. Specifically, porphyrin active sites are covalently grafted onto conductive and flexible polypyrrole linkers on graphene current collectors. The electrocatalyst with the semi-immobilized active sites exhibits homogeneous and heterogeneous functions simultaneously, performing enhanced redox kinetics and a regulated phase transition mode. The efficiency of the semi-immobilizing strategy is further verified in practical Li-S batteries that realize superior rate performances and long lifespan as well as a 343 Wh kg(-1) high-energy-density Li-S pouch cell. This contribution not only proposes an efficient semi-immobilizing electrocatalyst design strategy to promote the Li-S battery performances but also inspires electrocatalyst development facing analogous multiphase electrochemical energy processes.

Inspired by the transportation system of the plant root in nature, a biomimetic root-like carbon/titanium nitride (TiN/C) composite nanofiber is designed as a freestanding current collector for the high sulfur loading cathode. Like the plant root which absorbs water and oxygen from soil and transfers them to the trunk and branches, the root-like TiN/C matrix provides high-efficiency polysulfide, electron, and electrolyte transfer for the redox reactions via its three-dimensional-porous interconnected structure. In the meantime, TiN can not only anchor the polysulfides via the polar Ti-S and N-S bond but also further facilitate the redox reaction because of its high catalytic effect. With 4 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading, the TiN/C@S cathode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 983 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C current density; after 300 charge/discharge cycles, the discharge capacity remains 685 mA h g(-1), corresponding to a capacity decay rate of similar to 0.1%. Even when the sulfur loading is increased to 10.5 mg cm(-2), the cell still delivers a high capacity of 790 mA h g(-1) and a decent cycle life. We believe that this novel biomimetic root-like structure can provide some inspiration for the rational structure design of the high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries and other composite electrode materials.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is still impeded by the aggregation of sulfur, low-sulfur utilization, shuttling of dissolved polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we designed a hierarchically maple leaf-like structured sulfur electrodes by in-situ growth of ultrathin sulfur microcrystal on two-dimensional MXene-graphene-cellulose nanofiber (MGN) matrice (denoted as IS-MGN@S). The sulfur microcrystal as cathode can achieve improved kinetics than bulk sulfur due to its few layers of sulfur atoms, which is proved by the density functional theory calculations. The MXene not only confines polysulfides through strong chemisorption but also promotes the catalytic conversion of polysulfides. The introduction of graphene improves the conductivity and boosts the immobilization and conversion of polysulfides. As a result, the IS-MGN@S cathode demonstrates remarkable electrochemical properties with a high-initial capacity (1229 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C), substantial improvement in rate capability (770 mAh g(-1) at 2C), and stable long-term cycling capacity. Moreover, the pouch cells with IS-MGN@S cathode and gel electrolyte demonstrate excellent mechanical properties under mechanical damage (nail & cut tests, severe deformations), suggesting their promising applications for wearable electronic devices.

Herein, we have prepared cerium-oxide/graphene (CeO2/GR) interlayer by a simple secondary scraping and coating method, in which the uniformed CeO2 nanoparticles as diameter size of 10 nm with complete crystal structure were in- situ formed on GR by hydrothermal method and high temperature annealing. CeO2 nanoparticles, as a polar metal oxide can provide a large surface area to adsorb polysulfide, improve the utilization rate of the active material and inhibit the shuttle effect, GR can improve the conductivity of cathode materials. As a result, the electrochemical performance of LSBs can be significantly improved by CeO2/GR interlayer. As the best one, the battery with CeO2/GR-1.8 interlayer showed an excellent capacity of 1488 mA h g-1 under a current density of 167.5 mA g-1 (0.1 C). Besides, it exhibited a long-term cyclability with an inferior capacity decay of 0.13% per cycle and a super-high coulombic efficiency of 99.96% within 350 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance could due to the extra polysulfides adsorbed by CeO2, which contributed uniformly on the interlayer surface could be recycled and utilized during the long time cycling.

Herein, coral-like hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) is developed by a dual alkaline activation process. The production of HPC is inexpensive and scalable, which gives a great promise as sulfur host for the future application of Li-S batteries. Moreover, the as-prepared material achieves an admirable interconnected conductive network, hierarchical pore size distribution and notably high pore volume. This architecture contributes to ultrafast ion diffusion, rapid mass transport, robust electrode configuration as well as effective physical adsorption for soluble polysulfide, thus enabling a favorable scaffold for Li-S battery cathodes with high sulfur utilization and exceptionally electrochemical stability. As a consequence, the HPC based sulfur cathode manifests high areal capacity of 7.5mAh/cm(2) with a high sulfur loading and superb cycling stability over 500 cycles with lower sulfur loading. The classification of alkali significantly affects on the hierarchical porosity of the resultant carbon. And the correlation between the pore size distribution and electrochemical performance is revealed. This work offers a hierarchical material engineering of a sulfur host material for restricting the mobile polysulfide moieties, thus achieving a high efficiency and stable Li-S battery.

Systematic investigation of these MCS composites reveals that MC with a larger pore volume can hold a higher maximum sulfur loading, but overall the battery performance is very similar for different MCS composites at full sulfur-filling conditions (i.e., the condition at which the sulfur loading approaches the maximum limit set by the pore volume of the individual MC and, therefore, the pores of each MC are fully filled by sulfur). For the same MC, partial sulfur-filling (i.e., the condition at which the sulfur loading is lower than the maximum limit and, therefore, the pores are only partially filled with sulfur) leads to an improved initial discharge capacity and cycle stability, probably because of improved electrical and ionic transport during electrochemical reactions. Based on this understanding, an MCS composite electrode using MC with a large pore volume, partial sulfur filling, and a novel surface modification was designed for Li-S batteries. An initial capacity of similar to 1390 mA h g(-1) (based on sulfur) and a capacity retention of similar to 840 mA h g(-1) over 100 cycles at a 0.1 C rate were obtained using MC (22 nm, 4.8 cm(3) g(-1)) with 50 wt% sulfur loading and a commercially available Clevios P (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDT/PSS)) coating.

Here, a new type of ultrathin carbon-wrapped titanium nitride nanomesh (TiN NM@C) is prepared using a rationally designed nano-confinement topochemical conversion strategy. The ultrathin 2D geometry with well-distributed pores offers TiN NM@C plentiful exposed active sites and rapid charge transfer, leading to outstanding electrocatalytic performance tackling the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). LSBs employing TiN NM@C electrocatalyst deliver excellent rate capabilities (e.g., 304 mAh g(-1) at 10 C), greatly outperforming that of using TiN nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanosheets (TiN NPs@C) as a benchmark. More impressively, a free-standing electrode for LSBs with a high sulfur loading of 7.3 mg cm(-2) is demonstrated, showing a high peak areal capacity of 5.6 mAh cm(-2) at a high current density of 6.1 mA cm(-2). This work provides a new avenue for the facile and controllable fabrication of 2DNLMs with impressive electrocatalysis for LSBs as well as other energy conversion and storage technologies.

However, the use of a lithium-metal anode poses serious safety concerns due to lithium dendrite formation, which causes short-circuiting, and possible explosions of the cell. One feasible way to address this issue is to pair a fully lithiated lithium sulfide (Li2S) cathode with lithium metal-free anodes. However, bulk Li2S particles face the challenges of having a large activation barrier during the initial charge, low active-material utilization, poor electrical conductivity, and fast capacity fade, preventing their practical utility. Here, the development of a self-supported, high capacity, long-life cathode material is presented for Li-S batteries by coating Li2S onto doped graphene aerogels via a simple liquid infiltration-evaporation coating method. The resultant cathodes are able to lower the initial charge voltage barrier and attain a high specific capacity, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability. The improved performance can be attributed to the (i) cross-linked, porous graphene network enabling fast electron/ion transfer, (ii) coated Li2S on graphene with high utilization and a reduced energy barrier, and (iii) doped heteroatoms with a strong binding affinity toward Li2S/lithium polysulfides with reduced polysulfi de dissolution based on first-principles calculations.

Herein, leaf-like interconnected network structure of MWCNT/Co9S8 was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The MWCNT/Co9S8/S delivers a high specific capacity and good cycling stability. The initial discharge capacity of MWCNT/Co9S8/S is 1124 mAh g(-1) and retains at 503 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. The improved electrochemical performance of MWCNT/Co9S8/S could be attributed to the interconnected network MWCNT and polar Co9S8. As conductive skeletons, the interconnected network structure of MWCNT midribs provide fast conduction paths for electron and additional space for volume expansion of sulfur. Furthermore, sulfur particles well-distributed on the MWCNT/Co9S8 scaffold facilitate Li+ ions storage and release for energy delivery, which is beneficial to excellent activation of sulfur and high rate capacity. In addition, the polar Co9S8 leaves provide strong binding sites to trap polar polysulfide intermediates, which can suppress the shuttle effect effectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the defect-rich carbon black (CB) as sulfur host was successfully constructed through a rationally regulated defect engineering. Thus-obtained defect-rich CB can act as an active electrocatalyst to enable the sulfur redox reaction kinetics, which could be regarded as effective inhibitor to alleviate the LiPS shuttle. As expected, the cathode consisting of sulfur and defect-rich CB presents a high rate capacity of 783.8 mA center dot h center dot g(-1)at 4 C and a low capacity decay of only 0.07% per cycle at 2 C over 500 cycles, showing favorable electrochemical performances. The strategy in this investigation paves a promising way to the design of active electrocatalysts for realizing commercially viable Li-S batteries.

To address these issues once for all, we developed a three-in-one multifunctional binder based on three-dimensional (3D)cross-linked tannic acid (TA)/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) complex, wherein TA can drastically enhance the stability of PEO in electrolyte solution. As-designed TA/PEO binder integrates multiple functions in one material: (1) greatly retard the shuttle effect, (2) effectively maintain cathodes integrity, (3) improve lithium ions transfer capacity, yet this point is often ignored in many existing binders. Benefiting from the above merits, even with a simple sulfur/carbon composite as cathode materials as a proof-of-concept, the assembled Li-S batteries using the TA/PEO binder present a discharge capacity of 476.7 mA h g(-1) over 1000 cycles at 0.2 C, much higher than that with the PVDF binder (only 30 mA h g(-1)). The corresponding capacity fade is approximately 0.03%, superior to most reported binders. Even at a high sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm-2, the cell delivers a capacity retention of 74.5% over 150 cycles. Additionally, the cathode preparation using our TA/PEO binder is an aqueous process, making it particularly promising for large-scale manufacturing.

Herein, a hierarchically porous three-dimension (3D) carbon architecture assembled by cross-linked carbon leaves with implanted atomic Co-N-4 has been delicately developed as an advanced sulfur host through a SiO2-mediated zeolitic imidazolate framework-L (ZIF-L) strategy. The unique 3D architectures not only provide a highly conductive network for fast electron transfer and buffer the volume change upon lithiation-delithiation process but also endow rich interface with full exposure of Co-N-4 active sites to boost the lithium polysulfides adsorption and conversion. Owing to the accelerated kinetics and suppressed shuttle effect, the as-prepared sulfur cathode exhibits a superior electrochemical performance with a high reversible specific capacity of 695 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and a low capacity fading rate of 0.053% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C. This work may provide a promising solution for the design of an advanced sulfur-based cathode toward high-performance Li-S batteries.

The Co-3DC-rGO was used to modify commercial PP to prepare the Co-3DC-rGO/PP separator. The performance of Co-3DCrGO/PP separator was evaluated in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). SEM images exhibited that a three-dimensional carbon (3DC) skeleton was obtained by corn husk transformation, and the ZIF-67-derived cobalt decorated carbon dodecahedrons were homogeneously filled into the hierarchical pores of the 3DC structure. TEM images displayed that Co metal nanoparticles can escape from ZIF-67 and scatter on the rGO nano-sheets and 3DC skeleton. Benefitting from the synergy effects of the 3D carbon skeleton, rGO, and Co metal nanoparticles, the electrochemical performance of LSBs with Co-3DC-rGO/PP separator is better than LSBs with commercial PP separator. When tested at 1C, the LSB with Co-3DC-rGO/PP separator presents a high stable reversible capacity of 516.3 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles. This research provides new ideas for the preparation of LSBs separator. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the fast capacity decay of sulfur cathode caused by polysulfide dissolution and low specific capacity caused by poor electrical conductivity still impede the further development of lithium-sulfur battery. To address above issues, this study reports the synthesis of feather duster-like TiO2 architecture by in situ growth of TiO2 nanowires on carbon cloth and further evaluates as sulfur host material. The strong chemical binding interaction between the polysulfides and TiO2 feather duster efficiently restrains the shuttle effect, leading to enhanced electrochemical kinetics. Besides, the in situ grown TiO2 NWs array also supply high surface for sulfur-loading and fast path for electron transfer and ion diffusion. As results, the novel CC/TiO2/S composite cathode exhibits a high capacity of 608 mA h g(-1) at 1.0 C after 700 cycles corresponding to capacity decay as low as 0.045% per cycle with excellent Coulombic efficiency higher than 99.5%.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur batteries is one of the important bottlenecks that limits its rapid development. Herein, physical and chemical dual adsorption of lithium polysulfides are achieved by designing a novel framework structure consisting of MnO2, reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The framework-structure composite of MnO2/rGO/CNTs is prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The framework exhibits a uniform and abundant mesoporous structure (concentrating in similar to 12 nm). MnO2 is an alpha phase structure and the alpha-MnO2 also has a significant effect on the adsorption of lithium polysulfides. The rGO and CNTs provide a good physical adsorption interaction and good electronic conductivity for the dissolved polysulfides. As a result, the MnO2/rGO/CNTs/S cathode delivered a high initial capacity of 1201 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. The average capacities were 916 mAh g(-1), 736 mAh g(-1), and 547 mAh g(-1) at the current densities of 0.5 C, 1 C, and 2 C, respectively. In addition, when tested at 0.5 C, the MnO2/rGO/CNTs/S exhibited a high initial capacity of 1010 mAh g(-1) and achieved 780 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, with a low capacity decay rate of 0.11% per cycle. This framework-structure composite provides a simple way to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

This GCFF interlayer trapped the polysulfides on the cathode side and increased the utilization of sulfur by suppressing the shuttle phenomenon. Also, the GCFF was shown to be able to act as an upper current collector to reduce the charge-transfer resistance owing to the high crystallinity of the graphitic carbon fibers. The sulfur cathode with the GCFF interlayer showed a high specific initial discharge capacity of 1280.14 mAh g(-1) and excellent cycling stability (1004.62 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles) at 0.2 C. Also, an image of the glass fiber (GF) separator on the anode side confirmed the presence of an SEI after 200 cycles, which apparently resulted from stable Li deposition on the Li metal because of the low or medium concentration of sulfur in the electrolyte solution. Our observations should contribute to elucidating the key features of complex threedimensional carbon fabrics with crystalline graphitic structures that allow them, when inserted as interlayers, to markedly improve the performance of rechargeable batteries.

In this work, we reported a new strategy to stabilize sulfur cathodes with alkylene radicals to covalently connect sulfur through the formation of low-solubility lithium polysulfides, which enables high Coulombic efficiencies of 99.9% at 0.2 C, 99.9% at 0.5 C, 100% at 1 C, 100% at 2 C, 100% at 4 C, 100% at 6 C as well as outstanding rate capability with a high capacity of 702 mAh g(-1) at 6 C. The proposed mechanism was clearly revealed by in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy, demonstrating that short chain polysulfides as discharge products with low solubility are mainly produced during charging and discharging process. Moreover, DFT calculations confirmed that the bond breakage of the linear sulfur chains preferentially takes place in the center of the linear polysulfane, resulting in the formation of short-chain polysulfides, which could effectively avoid the production of soluble long-chain polysulfide and suppress the shuttling effect for high Coulumbic efficiency and high-rate capability lithium sulfur batteries.

Structural Dependence of the Sulfur Reduction Mechanism in Carbon-Based Cathodes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; COMPOSITE; CYCLE; TRANSITION; NANOTUBES; METALS	Lithium-sulfur batteries constitute a promising energy storage technology due to their high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, their commercialization has been hindered due to the low cycling life of the devices caused by long chain polysulfide shuttling between electrodes, the low conductivity of sulfur, and the volumetric expansion upon sulfur reduction. Nanostructured porous carbon cathodes have been the object of extensive research due to their proven capacity to overcome the aforementioned issues, though there is still a limited understanding of the physical-chemical behavior leading to high electrochemical performances. Herein, quantum chemical calculations are used to study the effect of the structure of porous carbon cathodes on the sulfur reactivity in lithium-sulfur batteries. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are initially employed to evaluate sulfur reduction mechanisms and kinetics in a confined environment. A porous cathode architecture is modeled through parallel graphene layers with, elemental sulfur rings in the interlayer and filled with 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) organic solvent and lithium ions. AIMD simulations showed fast reduction of elemental sulfur and formation of short chain polysulfide. Carbon dangling bonds at the cathode edge were confirmed to enhance the reactivity through strong sulfur-carbon and lithium-carbon interactions. Furthermore, adsorption calculations through density functional theory (DFT) proved the capacity of small pores to retain long polysulfide chains, providing a complete atomistic description of the physical-chemical behavior of sulfur and polysulfide in porous cathodes of lithium sulfur batteries. Finally, this work also demonstrates the influence of the specific current on the amount of sulfur utilization and practical specific capacity of the battery.

Herein, we present a new concept in which an organic oligoaniline, amine-capped aniline trimer (ACAT), serves as an effective suppressor of the LiPS migration in Li-S cells. The strong interaction between LiPS and ACAT facilitates the formation of bulky ACAT-LiPS complexes (organoLiPS complexes), which are then size-selectively sieved by the porous polymeric separators employed in Li-S cells. Thus, the addition of ACAT significantly ameliorates the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries due to suppressed LiPS migration. This new concept offers a viable strategy to achieve practically viable Li-S batteries.

Herein, a N-doped carbon-coated intercalated-bentonite (Bent@C) with interlamellar ion path and 3D conductive network architecture is designed to improve the performance of Li-S batteries by expediting ion/electron transport in the cathode. The interlamellar ion pathways are constructed through inorganic/organic intercalation of bentonite. The 3D conductive networks consist of N-doped carbon, both in the interlayer and on the surface of the modified bentonite. Benefiting from the unique structure of the Bent@C, the S/Bent@C cathode exhibits a high initial capacity of 1,361 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and achieves a high reversible capacity of 618.1 m Ah g(-1) at 2C after 500 cycles with a sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2). Moreover, with a higher sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm(-2), the cathode still delivers a reversible capacity of 560.2 mA h g(-1 )at 0.1C after 100 cycles.

Herein, we report the fabrication of a three-dimensional porous hollow core@shell structure composed of a carbon aerogel assembled core etched via nano-CaCO3 and a polypyrrole nanoparticle shell as a sulfur scaffold for Li-S batteries. The as-prepared sulfur cathodes exhibit excellent reversible capacity (1031.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), outstanding rate capability (566.5 and 477.2 mAh g(-1) at 1 and 2 C, respectively), and superior cycling stability (74.2% capacity retention rate at 1 C). The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the extraordinary core-shell structure: the honeycomb-like carbon aerogel core provides fast transportation for the Li+/e-, and even sufficient free space for the volume expansion; the polypyrrole nanoparticle shell acts not only as a physical obstacle but also as a polar material to restrict the shuttling of polysulfides by chemical interaction. These inspiring results specify that such electrodes could empower high performance, fast charging, and flexible Li-S batteries through a tunable molecular self-assembly method to clad strong polar material on carbon materials.

In this work, it is demonstrated that these problems can be significantly ameliorated via intrinsic lattice defect engineering in carbon-based sulfur host materials. Specifically, porous carbon nanotube microspheres (ePCNTM) are developed through a scalable spray drying method, followed by a critical water-steam etching under high temperature. Such "sauna" activation constructs abundant intrinsic topological defects in the carbon lattice, endowing ePCNTM with enhanced sulfur adsorbability and catalytic activity in sulfur redox reactions. In addition, the interwoven and highly porous architecture renders favorable conductivity, homogeneous sulfur distribution, and massive host-guest interactive surfaces. As a result, the ePCNTM-based sulfur electrodes achieve excellent cyclability with an ultralow capacity attenuation rate of 0.046% per cycle upon 500 cycles, excellent rate capability up to 3 C, and decent areal capacity retention of 3.2 mAh cm(-2) after 50 cycles under raised high sulfur loading. Thus, this synergistic approach, combining composite nanostructuring and intrinsic defect engineering, yields highly competitive Li-S batteries, which is also expected to inform advanced material development in related energy fields.

The composites are characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric (TG) measurements. The results show that sulfur is well dispersed and encapsulated homogeneously in the micropores of the flower-shaped activated porous carbon (FA-PC) with excellent electrical conductivity, high surface area, and large pore volume. The electrochemical tests show that the FA-PC/S composites with 60 wt % S have a high initial discharge capacity of 1388 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), good cycling stability (reversible discharging capacity of approximately 600 mA h g(-1) at 1600 mA g(-1)), and excellent rate capability.

The rational integration of nanomaterials into an effective membrane is expected to regulate the complex energy chemistry of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this contribution, a bio-inspired beaver-dam-like membrane was proposed as a robust and sulphifilic nest separator for advanced Li-S cells. The nest separator was integrated by a continuous polypropylene, a highly electrical conducting network of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and lithium polysulfide (LiPS)-suppressing adsorbents of magnesium borate hydroxide (MBOH) nanofibers to enhance the redox reaction of LiPS intermediates and retard their migration in a working cell. The kinetic behavior of LiPS conversion on sulphifilic surface was well understood through direct measurements of lithium sulfide nucleation and potentiostatic discharge profiles, demonstrating the interfacial affinity between MBOH and LiPS. The smart hybridization of MBOH and CNTs in nest separators rendered the Li-S cell with long cycling stability of 785 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles, high rate capability of 500 mA h g(-1) at 6 C, enhanced areal capacity of 2.91 mA h cm(-2), and improved thermal stability. The presented bio-inspired design sheds fresh light on a novel electrolyte system to demonstrate the superb electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries and affords new insights into understanding the interfacial interaction between LiPS and adsorbents.

Here, selective catalysis is proposed as a fundamental remedy for the consecutive solid-liquid-solid sulfur redox reactions. The proof-of-concept Indium (In)-based catalyst targetedly decelerates the solid-liquid conversion, dissolution of elemental sulfur to polysulfides, while accelerates the liquid-solid conversion, deposition of polysulfides into insoluble Li2S, which basically reduces accumulation of polysulfides in electrolyte, finally inhibiting the shuttle effect. The selective catalysis is revealed, experimentally and theoretically, by changes of activation energies and kinetic currents, modified reaction pathway together with the probed dynamically changing catalyst (LiInS2 catalyst), and gradual deactivation of the In-based catalyst. The In-based battery works steadily over 1000 cycles at 4.0 C and yields an initial areal capacity up to 9.4 mAh cm(-2) with a sulfur loading of approximate to 9.0 mg cm(-2).

The sulfur was impregnated into the microspheres to generate sulfur-Graphene/C/ SiO2 composites (S-G/C/SiO2) for Li-S batteries. The 3D porous microspheres consist of SiO2 nanoparticles connected by interconnected graphene and carbon layer, which could leave enough room for volume changes of sulfur during the charge-discharge process, and imprison the polysulfide via physical adsorption and chemical binding, thus effectively improving the cycle stability. As a result, the S-G/C/SiO2 with 20.1 wt. % SiO2 exhibits high discharge capacities up to 1118.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, an excellent rate capability of 551.7 mA h g(-1) at 5C, and an exciting cycle performance of 626.3 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 0.5C (ultralow capacity decay of only 0.062% per cycle), represented to be a promising cathode material for Li-S batteries.

Here, we prepared a nitrogen-doped carbon shell structured porous carbon-bimetal alloy composite with a particle diameter of 150 nm. In the shell of the structure, Co-Fe alloy particles as diameter of 20 nm with nitrogen-doped carbon coated were uniformly distributed. This porous nanocarbon materials have a rich surface area that can serve as a site for sulfur load. The uniform Co-Fe alloy catalytic and absorptive site can improve the oxidation-reduction reaction kinetics of LSBs and inhibit the shuttle effects of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the spatial domain restriction of the shell can be helpful to anchor S and polysulfides inside the structure. Because of these synergistic benefits, the Li-S batteries with this material cathode performs an excellent cycling stability with the capacity decay rate of 0.055% per cycle at 0.1 C after 100 cycles (initial capacity is 1226 mAh g-1) and 85.5% of initial capacity at 1 C after 300 cycles (initial capacity is 899.5 mAh g-1). Even with a high sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm-2, it still achieves a high capacity of 3.43 mAh cm-2 (75% of initial capacity) after 100 cycles. This study provides the potential possibility to achieve large-capacity long-cycle work in lithium-sulfur batteries. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ultraviolet/visible absorption, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies verified strong adsorption of Li2S6 by LiMn2O4. It could be explained by following possible adsorption mechanism that part Mn4+ on the surface of LiMn2O4 was reduced and transformed Mn3+ and Mn2+, at the same time, some S-6(2-) was oxidized and transformed Li2S6-x (1 < x < 6) which was adsorbed on S/LiMn2O4 electrode. In addition, S/LiMn2O4 electrode could exhibit the capacities of 924.9 and 728.0 mA h g(-1) at 1st and 300th cycle at 0.5 C, respectively, exceeding S/Acetylene black electrode's capacities of 722.1 and 518.9 mA h g(-1) in sequence. Rate property tests suggested that S/LiMn2O4 electrode had higher capacity than S/C electrode, which as well indicated that LiMn2O4 had better help in limiting polysulfides and promoting utilization of sulfur.

Sulfur was further dispersed onto the surface of PDA-HRG sheets by S/CS2 solution impregnation method to obtain PDA-HRG/S composite as the cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries. The resulting composites are characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and so on. The ultralight graphene matrix could improve the conductivity of the electrode and offer a large surface for deposition of sulfur, while the coating of hydrophilic soft PDA layer can adsorb polar polysulfides on-site and accommodate the volume change of S during the discharging processes, resulting in an excellent electrochemical performance.

The highly conductive and light-weight porous graphene foam not only increases the electron pathway of cathode, but also adsorbs the dissolved high-order lithium polysulfides during cycles, thus the loss of active materials is greatly avoided with only minimum mass addition approximately 0.3 mg cm(-2) on cathodic side. Additionally, the atomic layer deposition method is applied to deposit the zinc oxide nano-scale coating on graphene foam interlayer in order to chemically trap the polysulfides with minimized deterioration on conductivity of graphene foam. Among all the graphene foam, graphene foam@zinc oxide and graphene foam/graphene foam@zinc oxide interlayers, the graphene foam/graphene foam@zinc oxide exhibits the best electrochemical performance, delivering an initial specific capacity of 1051 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and retaining a reversible capacity of 672 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, while the cell without interlayer only shows 346 mAh g(-1). These results demonstrate the strategy of including a zinc oxide modified graphene foam interlayer as an effective light-weight interlayer for improving Li-S cell performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, some tricky challenges, such as electrically insulating elemental sulfur, shuttle effect and lithium dendrites, have been limiting its practical application. Modification of separators, which is found as a facile and low-cost settlement, has shown great advantages in solving the above three crucial problems, leading to greatly improved performance of Li-S batteries. In this paper, we summarize recent progresses on separators for Li-S batteries including coatings such as carbon materials, polymers, and inorganic materials, and tailoring multi-functional gel separators to achieve Li-S batteries with high performance. The importance and development directions of functional separators in the further commercialization of Li-S batteries are also discussed.

These unique features enable the composite cloth to be a promising material for energy storage application. As an efficient polysulfide adsorbent, the composite can be applied in lithium-sulfur batteries by being sandwiched between the sulfur cathode and polymeric separator. With this novel configuration, a high reversible capacity of ca. 900 mAh g(-1) and excellent cycle-life has been achieved, which is ascribed to the excellent polysulfides adsorption and confinement capability of the special core-shell and hollow structured porous hybrid fibers. Additionally, the composite cloth can be applied in supercapacitors as a flexible binder-free electrode, exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 271 F g(-1) (360 F cm(-3)) at 0.1 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH, as well as excellent rate capability and cycling stability. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor supplies a high energy density of up to 9.4 Wh kg(-1) (12.5 Wh L-1) with a power density of 25.0 W kg(-1) (33.3 W L-1) and remains 5.7 Wh kg(-1) (7.6 Wh L-1) with 4.5 kW kg(-1) (6.0 kW L-1).

These challenges are addressed in this study by the tandem use of a polysulfide conversion catalyst and a redox-targeting mediator in a gel sulfur cathode. Specifically, the gel cathode reduces the polysulfide mobility and hence the polysulfide shuttle and the passivation of the lithium anode by the crossover polysulfides. The redox mediator restrains the deposition of inactive sulfur species in the cathode thereby enabling the Fe-N and Co-N co-doped carbon catalyst to prolong its catalytic activity. Consequently, the integrated catalytic system is able to increase the discharge capacity of high-loading (6.8 mg cm(-2)) lean-electrolyte (4.0 mu L mg(-1)) Li-S batteries from similar to 630 to similar to 1316 mAh g(-1), concurrently with an improvement of the cycle life (600 cycles with 46% capacity retention at 1.0 mA cm(-2)). Redox mediator assisted catalysis in a gel cathode is therefore an effective strategy to extend the application of the sulfur conversion catalyst in lean electrolyte Li-S batteries.

However, the application of LSBs until now has been stubbornly dragged by the "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) due to dissolution of LiPSs in electrolyte and reaction with the lithium anode, incurring a severe capacity decay. Herein, the straightforward separator modification method that multiphase and multicomponent nickel-iron oxide heterostructure grown on oxidized carbon nanotube (NiFe2O4-NiO/OCNT) composites directly coated on the polypropylene (PP) separator, has been implemented, which effectively inhibits the migration of LiPSs, enhances the electron and lithium-ion transfer, and promotes the redox kinetics by virtue of the heterostructure interfaces between NiFe2O4, NiO, and OCNT. In conclusion, the synthesized NiFe2O4-NiO/OCNT/PP separator delivers good rate capacities and high stability up to 1000 cycles at 2 C with a low-capacity decay rate of approximately 0.065 % per cycle.

The material therefore maximizes theoretical capacity while inhibiting the formation of polysulfide intermediates that lead to parasitic shuttle. The material we report contains a 1:1 ratio of S:C with a theoretical capacity of 609mAhg(-1). The cell gains capacity through 100cycles and has 98% capacity retention thereafter through 200cycles, demonstrating stable, long-term cycling. Raman spectroscopy confirms the proposed mechanism of disulfide bonds breaking to form a S-Li thiolate species upon discharge and reforming upon charge. Coulombic efficiencies near 100% for every cycle, suggesting the suppression of polysulfide shuttle through the molecular design.

Carbonaceous materials take a leading stand for the improvement of gravimetric and areal capacity in lithium-sulfur batteries; however, they exhibit some intrinsic deficiencies, including insufficient fixation on lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and low tap density, incurring poor volumetric performance and inferior cycling behavior. Here, we report a sulfur cathode based on highly conductive ZrB2 nanoflakes with only 2 wt % conductive carbon. The resultant closely packed ZrB2-S electrode delivers a high areal capacity of 8.5 mAh cm(-2) and cell-level volumetric energy density of 533 Wh L-1 with a high sulfur loading of 7.8 mg cm(-2) and an ultralow electrolyte dosage. With combined spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculation results, it was confirmed that an in-built Janus crystal facet self-mediation is on-site constructed by the exposed B and Zr atoms for an effective bonding and selective conversion on LiPS upon charge-discharge processes.

However, their specific capacity and cyclic stability are hindered by poor conductivity of sulfur and the dissolution of redox intermediates. Here, we design polypyrrole-MnO2 coaxial nanotubes to encapsulate sulfur, in which MnO2 restrains the shuttle effect of polysulfides greatly through chemisorption and polypyrrole serves as conductive frameworks. The polypyrrole-MnO2 nanotubes are synthesized through in situ polymerization of pyrrole using MnO2 nanowires as both template and oxidization initiator. A stable Coulombic efficiency of similar to 98.6% and a decay rate of 0.07% per cycle along with 500 cycles at 1C-rate are achieved for S/PPy-MnO2 ternary electrodes with 70 wt % of S and 5 wt % of MnO2. The excellent trapping ability of MnO2 to polysulfides and tubular structure of polypyrrole with good flexibility and conductivity are responsible for the significantly improved cyclic stability and rate capability.

However, its practical application is mainly hindered by volume expansion during cycling and irreversible shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, we reported a rational design and fabrication of multi yolk-shell Co-NC@ nitrogen doped hollow carbon spheres (Co-NC@N-HCSs) as sulfur host for high performance Li-S batteries via a nano-confined synthesis strategy. The growth mechanism of multi yolk-shell ZIF-67s@N-HCSs nanostructure was studied and the ZIF-67 yolks were tunable by changing the reactant concentration. Regarding to multi yolk-shell Co-NC@N-HCSs hybrid, the nitrogen doped carbon shell provides effective physical confinement, abundant sulfur loading space and volume expansion alleviation, while the multi polar Co-NC yolks can enhance the internal electron conductivity inside the cavity and offer stronger chemisorption capability for LiPSs as well as catalytic effects on the redox reaction of LiPSs. Benefiting from the unique multi yolk-shell design, the S/Co-NC@N-HCSs electrode with sulfur content of 80.82 wt%, exhibits high discharge capacity of 1173 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and 995.8 mAh g(-1) at 1C. It also shows long cycle life up to 450 cycles with a slow capacity decay rate of 0.13% per cycle. The electrochemical performance of S/Co-NC@N-HCSs is obviously promoted compared with S/N-HCSs, suggesting its potential to develop high performance lithium sulfur batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we reported an efficient strategy to confine active sulfur in chemically tailored graphene nanosheets, which were prepared via modified chemical activation of hydrothermal reduced graphene oxide hydrogels. Due to its high specific surface area, large pore volume, controllable size and distribution of nanopores, the two-dimensional (2D) highly porous activated graphene nanosheets (AGNs) were proved to be a promising scaffold to uniformly confine elemental sulfur (S) in their nanopores with high loading. The resultant AGNs/S nanocomposites exhibited a reversible capacity up to 1379 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C as well as remarkable cycling stability, which may contribute to the desirable structural features. The dense nanopores of AGNs, as "microreactors" for the electrochemical reactions of sulfur, minimized polysulfide dissolution and shuttling in the electrolyte, and also reserved fast transport of lithium ions to the sequestered sulfur by ensuring good electrolyte penetration. Furthermore, the AGNs with good electronic conductivity allowed good transport of electrons from/to the poorly conducting sulfur for electrochemical reactions at high rates.

Here, we develop a nepenthes-like N-doped hierarchical graphene (NHG)-based separator to realize an efficient polysulfide scavenger for Li-S batteries. The 3D textural porous NHG architectures are realized by our designed biotemplating chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach via the employment of naturally abundant diatomite as the growth substrate. Benefiting from the high surface area, devious inner-channel structure, and abundant nitrogen doping of CVD-grown NHG frameworks, the derived separator favorably synergizes bifunctionality of physical confinement and chemical immobilization toward polysulfides, accompanied by smooth lithium ion diffusions. Accordingly, the batteries with the NHG-based separator delivers an initial capacity of 868 mAh g(-1) with an average capacity decay of only 0.067% per cycle at 2 C for 800 cycles. A capacity of 805 mAh g(-1) can further be achieved at a high sulfur loading of similar to 7.2 mg cm(-2). The present study demonstrates the potential in constructing high-energy and long-life Li-S batteries upon separator modification.

Study of Improvement Life and Electrochemical Characteristics for Lithium/sulfur Battery using Porous Carbon Sphere	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			Korean	Article						Li-S battery; cabon sphere; meso pore; cycle life; rate-capability		Dissociation into Lithium-polysulfide electrolyte due to repeated cycles during the Lithium/Sulfur battery reaction is a major problem of reduced battery lifespan. We searched for a porous carbon with a large specific surface area that infiltrated S to prevent liquid Lithium-polysulfide from being dissolved in electrolyte, induce adsorption of Lithium-polysulfide, and further increase conductivity. In order to obtain porous carbon spheres with a large specific surface area, the carbon spheres of 1939 m(2)/g were raised to 2200 m(2)/g through additional KOH treatment. In addition, through heat treatment with S, a carbon sulfur compound containing 75 wt% of S was fabricate and material analysis was conducted on the possibility of using the cathode material. The electrochemical characteristics of the Reference (622; sulfur: 60%, conductive material: 20%, binder: 20%) pouch cell and the pouch cell made using 75wt% of carbon sulfur compound were analyzed. 75wt% of carbon sulfur pouch cell showed a 20% increase in lifespan and 10% improvement in C-rate compared to the Reference pouch cell after 50 cycles.

Despite many efforts in pursuing long cycle life, relatively little emphasis has been placed on increasing the areal energy density. Herein, we have designed and developed a 'pie' structured electrode, which provides an excellent balance between gravimetric and areal energy densities. Combining lotus root-like multichannel carbon nanofibers 'filling' and amino-functionalized graphene 'crust', the free-standing paper electrode (S mass loading: 3.6 mgcm(-2)) delivers high specific capacity of 1,314 mAhg(-1) (4.7mAhcm(-2)) at 0.1 C (0.6mAcm(-2)) accompanied with good cycling stability. Moreover, the areal capacity can be further boosted to more than 8mAhcm(-2) by stacking three layers of paper electrodes with S mass loading of 10.8 mgcm(-2).

The composite was characterized by elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical measurements. XRD and FTIR results showed that sulfur well dispersed in the core-shell structure and PPy structure was successfully obtained via in situ oxidative polymerization of pyrrole on the surface of sulfur particles. TEM observation revealed that PPy was formed and fixed to the surface of sulfur nanoparticle after polymerization, developing a well-defined core-shell structure and the thickness of PPy coating layer was in the range of 20-30 nm. In the composite, PPy worked as a conducting matrix as well as a coating agent, which confined the active materials within the electrode. Consequently, the as prepared S/PPy composite cathode exhibited good cycling and rate performances for rechargeable lithium/sulfur batteries. The resulting cell containing S/PPy composite cathode yields a discharge capacity of 1039 mAh.g(-1) at the initial cycle and retains 59% of this value over 50 cycles at 0.1 C rate. At 1 C rate, the S/PPy composite showed good cycle stability, and the discharge capacity was 475 mAh.g(-1) after 50 cycles.

Ultraviolet (UV)-curing technology is an effective strategy to solve the abovementioned problems. However, carbon black and other conductive agents used in the production of the battery industry show strong absorption of UV light; thus, a single photoinitiator cannot absorb enough light intensity to realize initiation, limiting its application in the battery industry. In this work, the concept of full-band absorption is introduced into the manufacturing process of the LSB cathode to solve the abovementioned problems. The full-band absorption of photoinitiators in the UV band is successfully realized by combining the photoinitiators 2-benzyl-2-dimethylamino-1-(4-morpholinylphenyl)-1-butanone, 2-isopropyl thioxanthone, and bis (2,4,6-trimethyl benzoyl)-phenoxyphosphine. An ultraviolet in situ polymerized polyurethane acrylate (PUA) binder is successfully prepared by the combination of photoinitiators. PUA is used as the binder of LSBs and exhibits an excellent long-cycle performance of 1500 cycles with a low decay rate of 0.04% per cycle at 0.5 C. Thus, UV-curing technology provides a new prospect and possibility of industrialization for battery manufacturing.

In order to obtain such DM-PAs/S composites, the non-sulfur-containing disordered mesoporous polyacenes (DM-PAs) precursor, which had a high BET surface area of 1136.0 m(2)/g, a pore volume of 1.37 cm(3)/g and unique bimodal mesopores (2.98/7.39 nm), was firstly prepared by using phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin as raw material as well as both polyethylene glycol (PEG) and ZnCl2 as activation agents. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that, the as-prepared DM-PAs/S could be served as superior cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. It was disclosed that the DM-PAs/S with the S content of about 67 wt % (S-DM-PAs/S-67) presented the best electrochemical properties when the specific capacity is calculated based on the total mass of DM-PAs/S composite containing active sulfur and inactive DM-PAs. At a charge/discharge rate of 1 C, the S-DM-PAs/S-67 electrode exhibits a good long-term cycling stability with a high reversible capacity of about 513.57 mAh/gSulfur after 500 cycles. The advanced electrochemical performances should be attributed to the uniform distribution of sulfur in the DM-PAs matrix, high electronic conductivity of DM-PAs, and the effective hinder of dissolvable polysulfides by the pores in the DM-PAs.

The resulting composite showed a high specific surface area of 1620.7 m(2) g(-1) and a high sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2). The calixarene is uniformly dispersed on the carbon spheres and efficiently captures polysulfides by interaction with the sulfonate groups. Meanwhile, the cross-linked porous structure of the composite restricts the migration of polysulfides. The cathode delivers an outstanding electrochemical performance with an initial capacity of 1304.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. Furthermore, it displays excellent long-term cycling stability, maintaining 884.7 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5 C.

The Li-S battery using the CNTs-COOH@hemin cathode exhibits the optimal initial specific capacity (1637.8 mAh g(-1)) and cycle durability (up to 1800 cycles). Various in situ characterization techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, and UV-vis spectroscopy, combined with density functional theory computations are used to investigate the structure-reactivity correlation and the working mechanism in the Li-S system. It is demonstrated that the unique structure of the CNTs-COOH@hemin composite with good conductivity and adequate active sites resulting from molecule catalyst as well as the strong absorption to polysulfides entrapped by the coordinated Fe(III) complex with Fe-O bond enables the homogeneous dispersion of S, facilitates the catalysis and conversion of polysulfides, and improves the battery's performance.

To overcome the bottleneck, we used 1D TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (T-CNF) and 2D rGO nanosheets as "rebar" and "cement" to construct a tough framework, and the monolayer MXene (m-MXene) was uniformly wrapped on the framework forming a MXene-coated three-dimensional aerogel (MCG aerogel) with high ionic and electronic conductivity. It is worth mentioning that the negatively charged groups of MXene can not only accelerate the ion diffusion rate and the conversion process of polysulfides by anchoring polysulfides through strong adsorption sites, but also construct an ion selective layer to inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Moreover, the T-CNF-enhanced three-dimensional structure alleviates the negative impact of sulfur volume expansion during the charging and discharging process, making it possible to directly used the aerogel as self-supporting electrodes without any binder. Therefore, the T-CNF/rGO hybrid aerogels with monolayer MXene coating as cathode materials for Lithium-sulfur batteries exhibit high discharge capacity of 1470 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and improved rate capability of 744 mA h g(-1) at 5 C. The high-strength framework structure with uniform surface sulfur-anchor coating design strategy offers a new angle of regulating the diffusion kinetic rate of lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this work, a facile vacuum filtration method is employed to graft polyethyleneimine to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in a "hand-in-hand" way using the amino and catechol groups from polydopamine. The resulting polymer-reinforced rGO (PPG) film is applied as a free-standing auxiliary functional layer for Li-S batteries. It has been confirmed by both theoretical calculations and experimental methods that, benefiting from the rich amine groups and oxygen-containing functional groups, the as-prepared PPG composite film shows great ability to capture polysulfides. Moreover, its high conductivity enables itself to function as a polysulfide reservoir, thus facilitating the successive reutilization of the trapped active materials and improving sulfur utilization. For this reason, the PPG film can also be regarded as a cathode material, serving as a novel "SPPG cathode" together with the pure sulfur cathode. The cell assembled with the pure sulfur cathode and the PPG auxiliary functional layer displays high reversible capacity, excellent Coulombic efficiency, and good cycling stability, suggesting that the rational auxiliary functional layer design ensures a good match with pure sulfur cathodes and shows the potential to achieve energy-dense Li-S batteries.

Herein, we report a facile strategy to synthesize a hierarchically porous carbon via the pyrolysis of seaweed biomass under inert atmosphere and apply it as a cathode material in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries for the first time. Systematic materials characterization suggests that the seaweed carbon (SWC) is doped with N and displays micro-, meso- and macroporous structures and possesses a high total pore volume of 1.48 cm(3) g(-1) and a high surface area of 1510.71 m(2) g(-1), which is beneficial for encapsulating a large amount of sulfur. The as-obtained SWC-S composite, containing 65.7 wt% sulfur content, delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 1221.2 mAh g(-1) and retained a capacity of 826.4 mAh g(-1) after 70 cycles at 0.2 C. Additionally, the SWC-S composite produced a reversible capacity of 540.6 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at high rate of 1 C. Compared to the pure sulfur cathode, the SWC-S cathode displays excellent rate capabilities, low polarization and good reaction kinetics, highlighting that this biomass-derived porous carbon is suitable for assembling high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, we increase the capacity retention and cycle life of the Li-S battery through the addition of an interlayer made of polypyrrole (PPy)-treated carbon paper (CP) in a Li-S battery. We first quantitatively investigate the effect of the thickness of the carbon paper and then optimize a novel interlayer prepared by using PPy adhered to the carbon paper. The results show that 300 mu m CP is the best choice among the three thicknesses. The CP-300 samples deliver a reversible capacity of 490 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles with a 0.5 C rate and show the best rate performance. Because of the porous structure and conductivity of the as-prepared PPy interlayer, the battery incorporating the PPy interlayer exhibits more excellent cycle performance and better rate performance than the CP batteries. Surprisingly, the PPy-coated CP-200 battery displays a reversible capacity of 555 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles with a 0.5 C rate. This feasible way to modify a carbon paper interlayer may have promising prospects in the Li-S battery field.

However, practical application of a Li-S battery is restricted severely by easy dissolution of lithium polysulfides and high flammability of sulfur. Herein, we developed, for the first time, a multifunctional composite directly prepared by a facile, green, low-cost, and large-scale ball-milling method with fly ash and sulfur. Due to the unique microstructure and sulfur related components as chemical anchors, composites possessed good electron/ion transport, favorable resistance to volume change of sulfur, and strong chemical affinity to polysulfides, which greatly facilitate redox kinetics, maintain structural integrity of the cathode, and suppress polysulfide shuttling in electrolyte, hence significantly boosting electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery with high initial discharge capacity, superior cycling stability, and satisfying rate capability. Typically, Li-S batteries based on a composite with a sulfur loading of 86.9% present initial discharge capacities of 969.8, 894.3, and 769.7 mAh g(-1) as well as capacity decay rates of 0.068% (400 cycles), 0.1% and 0.042% per cycle (200 cycles) at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 C, respectively. Moreover, the average specific self-extinguishing time of the composite-based cathode was clearly reduced to less than half of that of the pristine sulfur-based cathode, indicating significantly promoting the safety of the battery.

The heteroatoms considered were B, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S and Cl.

Herein, we present a porous Mo2C-Mo3N2 heterostructure/rGO host and the Mo2C-Mo3N2 heterostructure combines the merits of high adsorption Mo2C and high catalytic Mo3N2 so as to achieve rapid anchoring-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs across the Mo2C-Mo3N2 heterointerface. The Mo2C-Mo3N2 heterointer-face boosts the trapping efficiency and conversion to Li2S of LiPSs. rGO provides fast paths for electron transport as well as serves as a protective layer to prevent the structure from being damaged during cycling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that Mo2C has stronger adsorption ability for Li2S4 than Mo3N2 and Mo3N2 has better reaction kinetic characteristics. Experimentally, Mo2C-Mo3N2/rGO@S electrode respectively shows outstanding rate capability. At high sulfur loadings (3.4 and 5.0 mg cm(-2)), the capacity retention values are 78%, and 70% at 0.5C after 300 cycles. Mo2C-Mo3N2/rGO sulfur electrodes shows high Li+ diffusion coef-ficient of 4.56 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1), which benefits from the accelerated conversion of LiPSs at interface. Our results reveal the critical role of anchoring-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs in terms of inhibiting the shuttle effect.

However, due to the reproducibility of nonpolar S-8, polar polysulfide intermediates and the final Li2S during cycling, developing an effective matrix to reduce sulfur consumption in the cathode and improve the cycle stability is still challenging. Herein, a polar and nonpolar matrix consisting of twined multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and high nitrogen-doped porous carbon is designed, in which the twined MWCNT could provide the nonpolar and physical bind, meanwhile, the N-enriched porous carbon derived from ionic liquid could provide polar and chemical anchoring. The composite is prepared by carbonizing the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (Emim-dca) ionic liquid, which is loaded on the intertwined MWCNT. The ionic-liquid-derived composite material shows more microporous and low-diameter mesoporous structures than intertwined MWCNT, and the nitrogen content reaches 7.42 At%. Assembled in lithium-sulfur batteries, the specific capacity of the battery reaches 1558.6 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle of 0.1 C. After the 300 times cycling at 1 C, the specific capacity still remains 614.34 mAh g(-1) and the attenuation is only 0.021% for each cycle. Moreover, the attenuation in the changing rate charge-discharge test is weaker than the pure intertwined MWCNT composite cathode.

The main challenge is to increase the electrochemical utilization and stabilization of sulfur cathodes by mitigating the undesirable soluble polysulfide shuttle problem. Herein, a zinc selenide/carbon hybrid (ZnSe/C) is constructed as a regulator of commercial polypropylene (PP) separator to modify the sulfiphilicity of polysulfide species. It is revealed that the polar ZnSe/C hybrid greatly inhibits the shuttling effect by strong chemisorption and thereafter fast electrocatalytic transformation of polysulfides. Accordingly, the ZnSe/C-modified PP separator could kinetically expedite the redox reaction and effectively promotes the utilization and confinement of the active sulfur in the cathode side. As a consequence, the ZnSe/C-PP-cell exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, including an impressive capacity delivery of 1458/605 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C/5 C and long lifetime with 608 mAh g(-1) retained after 1000 cycles at 1 C. This study paves a rational pathway for designing and propelling transition-metal-selenide electrocatalysts toward the practical application of Li-S batteries.

Large S-8 and small S2-4 molecules are successfully infiltrated into 22 nm mesopores and 0.5 nm micropores, respectively. We successfully investigate the effect of sulfur immobilization in mesopores and micropores on the electrochemical performance of lithiumsulfur (Li-S) battery based on NDCsulfur hybrid cathodes. The large S-8 molecules in 22 nm mesopores can be removed by a prolonged heat treatment, with only small molecules of S2-4 immobilized in micropores of NDC matrices. The NDC/S2-4 hybrid exhibits excellent cycling performance, high Coulombic efficiency, and good rate capability as cathode for Li-S batteries. The confinement of smaller S2-4 molecules in the micropores of NDS efficiently avoids the loss of active sulfur and formation of soluble high-order Li polysulfides. The porous carbon can buffer the volume expansion and contraction changes, promising a stable structure for cathode. Furthermore, N doping in MOF-derived carbon not only facilitates the fast charge transfer but also is helpful in building a stronger interaction between carbon and sulfur, strengthening immobilization ability of S2-4 in micropores. The NDS-sulfur hybrid cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 936.5 mAh g(-1) at 100th cycle with a Coulombic efficiency of 100% under a current density of 335 mA g(-1). It displays a superior rate capability performance, delivering a capacity of 632 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 5 A g(-1). This uniquely porous NDC derived from MOF nanocrystals could be applied in related high-energy storage devices.

Morphological examination showed that the sulfur and PAN in the composite were wrapped by highly conducting wrinkled layers of GO, aiding in higher utilization of the active mass. The composite exhibited good cycling stability. The first-cycle capacity obtained with PAN/S/GO was 1402 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C rate with a Coulombic efficiency of 99%; furthermore, it delivered a capacity of 1096 mAh g(-1) in the 50th cycle, which was higher than that of and S/GO composites. The improved performance is attributed to the adsorptive properties of GO as well as surface functional groups in GO, which aid in confining polysulfide species within the cathode architecture.

Successful implementation of Li-S batteries requires the development of a robust and high-performance sulfur cathode. Unfortunately, the current approaches focus on the development of sulfur-carbon composites without a fundamental understanding of the reduction mechanism of sulfur and the role of carbon. To develop a clear understanding of the efficacy of carbon/sulfur composites, we investigated the electrochemical behavior of Li-S batteries employing different cathode structures.

A multi-functional PP@MWCNTs-OHP@PP sandwich separator was formed by MWCNTs-OHP cellulose paper sandwiching between two polypropylene(PP) membranes and was used in lithium-sulfur battery. The morphology and structure of PP@MWCNTs-OHP@PP were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The electrochemical test showed that the initial discharge capacity of Li-S batteries with the PP@MWCNTs-OHP@PP sandwich separator reached to 1532 mA . h/g and the utilization rate of active substances reached 91.5%. The capacity still maintained 516 mA . h/g at 1C after 500 cycles with stabilized coulombic efficiency above 96.4% and slow capacity decay rate of 0.028% per cycle. As the charge-discharge rate decreased from 3C to 0.1C, the discharge capacity recovered from 336 mA . h/g to 820 mA . h/g, showing excellent magnification.

The CNS nanoparticles and N in CNS/N-rGO strongly interact with polysulfides, whereas graphene, as a conductive network, can improve its electrical conductivity. A CNS/N-rGO/sulfur composite cathode was prepared via the sulfur melting diffusion method. The electrochemical study showed that the CNS/N-rGO/sulfur cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1430 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1C. Moreover, it retained a specific capacity of 685 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5C with a coulombic efficiency of 98%, which was better than that of commercial rGO. This composite was used as a sulfur cathode for a lithium-sulfur battery, exhibiting excellent rate capability and remarkable performance in terms of long cycling stability.

Nevertheless, issues of poor conductivity, severe volume change during cycling, and particular deleterious shuttle effects impede the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a convenient and scalable method via electrostatic self-assembly and in situ solvothermal strategies is employed to prepare three-dimensional hierarchical nMOF-867/Ti3C2Tx. In this advantageous heterostructure, nMOF-867 with rich porosity not only provides the accommodation of sulfur but also enables chemical binding of polysulfides through stable double bonds (Li-N and Zr-S bond), while the distribution of nMOF-867 on the highly conductive Ti3C2Tx would promote redox conversion kinetics of adsorbed polysulfides. Furthermore, structurally stable nMOF-867/Ti3C2Tx can serve as a buffer to reduce the volume expansion during the charge/discharge process. Hence, nMOF-867/Ti3C2Tx, the sulfur host of lithium-sulfur batteries, exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1302 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a remarkable rate capability of 581 mAh g(-1) at 4 C. Impressively, a high initial capacity of 801 mAh g(-1) can be retained at 1 C, with the slight capacity fading rate of 0.054% per cycle over 1000 charge/discharge cycles. This work provides the inspiration to generally fabricate the well-designed MXene-based nanocomposites for lithium-sulfur batteries with good performance.

Under a photo illumination, the photocatalysis effect derived from the photo-generated electrons/holes efficiently decreases the reaction energy barrier of polysulfides to Li2S by 70 mV; and the photoconductive effect largely increases the charge concentration and boosts the electrochemical kinetics because of abundant photo-generated carriers. The photo-assisted LSB could also be directly photo-charged and gain a specific discharge capacity of 608 mA h g-1 with a high energy conversion efficiency of 2.3%, which is about 36.3% of the theoretical specific capacity of the LSB. Consequently, a stable reversible capacity of approximately 1225 mA h g-1 is achieved with an outstanding 100% energy efficiency, which is ~10% higher than the circumstance of no light illumination, indicating that the photo-assisted LSB achieves an apparent lossless energy storage under only 0.5-sun illumination in the wavelength range of 300800 nm. This work provides a completely sustainable model for efficiently promoting the electrochemical performances of LSBs.

However, the insulating of sulfur, Li2S2/Li2S, and the shuttling effect of high order lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) hinder its practical applications. Herein, a heterostructure is explored to enhance the conversion reaction kinetics and adsorption ability of LiPSs. By rationally designing a conductive carbon framework and polar metal sites, both experimental and theoretical results show strong adsorption abilities for dissolved LiPSs and promote the conversion reaction rate. A CoSe2/Co3O4@NC-CNT/S cathode shows an excellent rate performance (approximate to 1457 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and still retains approximate to 688 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 5 C). When performing charge-discharge in long-term stability at 2 C, the CoSe2/Co3O4@NC-CNT/S cathode delivers a high initial specific capacity of approximate to 780 mAh g(-1) and retains approximate to 602 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with an excellent Coulombic efficiency of approximate to 95.4%. Remarkably, the battery can entirely operate even at a very high sulfur loading of approximate to 10.1 mg cm(-2) and lean electrolyte condition. This work emphasizes a new strategy to rationally design heterostructures that can encourage the industrial application of LSBs.

However, commercial development of lithium-sulfur batteries is severely hindered by the cathode host materials. To tackle this issue, we synthesized a new host material, high surface area, three-dimensional (3D) diamond-cage porous polymer frameworks PPN-13, to construct sulfur electrode by impregnating sulfur into its nano-pores. The PPN-13-S cathode deliveries a specific discharge capacity up to 606.4 mA h/g over 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a high coulombic efficiency. It demonstrates that the 3D porous structure PPN-13 as host material shows the high performance and a remarkable positive effect on the capacity retention as cathode materials in lithium-sulfur batteries. Due to the unique features of the material, our research provides a new type of materials for tailoring cathode materials in lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, "polysulfide shuttle" is known as a major issue of accelerating capacity fading and corroding the metal lithium anode, which impedes its commercial application. Here, a nitrogen-sulfur codoped two-dimensional carbon material is synthesized using a novel template method by pyrolyzing chemical adsorption of montmorillonite and methylene blue. The microstructure and morphologies of the synthesized two-dimensional carbon materials are fully characterized using SEM, TEM, XRD, and Raman techniques. The experiment results indicate that the carbon material shows a typical graphene structure. The micro/mesoporous and heteroatoms codoped structure of the synthesized carbon material exhibits excellent performance in electronic conductivity and polysulfides confinement. The functional separator laminated with the binder-free carbon material endows the battery outstanding electrochemical and rate performances. The excellent rate performance is discovered a capacity of 828 mAh g(-1) at 4 C with good reversibility. The battery presents a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1049 mAh g(-1) with good capacity retention of 690 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C. Consequently, the separator laminated with the nitrogen-sulfur codoped graphene is promising for the construction of high performance Li-Sd batteries.

Larger and soluble polysulfide intermediates (Li2Sx, 4x8) are trapped by the graphene shells and thus to refrain from dissolution into the organic electrolyte, so that a stable cycling performance can be achieved. Moreover, the graphene shell and hollow space in-between also help to ensure the integrity of the hybrid cathode against the volume expansion upon cycling. On the other hand, MC confines smaller sulfur molecules (S2-4) within its small pores and suppresses the formation of soluble polysulfides. The resulting electrode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 982mAhg(-1) with enhanced capacity retention of 85.4% after 100(th) cycles at 0.2 C rates. More importantly, it exhibits a high discharge capacity of 886mAhg(-1), which is maintained at 601mAhg(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C with a coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%, which is the best performance among reported cycle stabilities.

Herein, a cathode material with S up to 93 wt % is designed via a hollow donor-pi-acceptor heterosystem, which combines catalytic sites, adsorption sites, and good conductivity together. Following this guidance, a hollow porous carbon sphere is prepared with CoO particles and single V atoms decorated on it (Co/V-HPCS), providing ultrahigh volumetric space for sulfur. Even the electrode made of sulfur-loaded Co/V-HPCS (Co/V-HPCS@S) has a high content of 90 wt % (sulfur content in the electrode is similar to 83.5 wt %), and the cathode exhibits an excellent discharge capacity of 575.2 mAh g(-1) under 0.2C after 100 cycles. With careful analysis by means of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), the catalytic amounts of CoO particles and single V atoms loaded on the carbon shell are confirmed, which endows the material with outstanding catalytic ability to transfer sulfur and excellent adsorption of polysulfides. This concept of the cathode material increases the possibility of advanced long-life Li-S batteries with high tap density and high energy density.

Herein, a new strategy based on the fluidized bed chemical vapor deposition (FB-CVD) process was proposed to prepare 3D graphene networks (3DGNs) with various nano-architectures. Specially designed SiC-C@graphene core/shell nanoparticles were prepared taking the advantages of the FB-CVD system, and 3DGNs with hierarchical nanostructures were obtained after removing the SiC core. The 3DGNs performed well as electrodes of lithium-sulfur batteries. The C-S cathode showed good rate performance at the current density of 0.1-2.0 C, and an initial discharge capacity of 790 mAhg(-1) cathode was achieved at a current density of 0.2 C. The Li-S batteries showed stabilized coulombic efficiency as high as 94% and excellent cyclic performance with an ultra low cyclic fading rate of 0.075% for the initial 280 cycles at a current density of 1.0 C. The improved electrochemical performance was ascribed to the enhanced conductivity by the connective graphene networks and the weakened shuttle effect by the special outer graphene layers. Mass production of the products was realized by the continuous FB-CVD process, which opens up new perspectives for large scale application of 3D graphene materials.

Red phosphorus nanoparticles (RPEN)-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) film (RPEN@CF) is reported herein as a novel interlayer for Li-S batteries, which shows strong chemisorption of LiPSs, good flexibility, and excellent electric conductivity. A pulsed laser ablation method is engaged for the ultrafast production of RPEN of uniform morphology, which are deposited on the CNT film by a direct spinning method. The RPEN@CF interlayer provides pathways for effective Li+ and electron transfer and strong chemical interaction with LiPSs. The S/RPEN@CF electrode shows a superior specific capacity of 782.3 mAh g(-1) (3 C-rate) and good cycling performances (769.5 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C-rate). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the morphology and dispersibility of RPEN are crucial in enhancing Li+ and electron transfer kinetics and effective trap of LiPSs. This work demonstrates the possibility of using the RPEN@CF interlayer for the enhanced electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries and other flexible energy storage devices.

The sulfur content of this terpolymer is about 72 wt%. As it is viscous but flowable at room temperature, it can be mixed with conductive graphene without binders. Poly(sulfur-styrene-peanut oil) (poly(S-Sty-P)) terpolymer is further successfully utilized as the active cathode material in Li-S batteries. The initial specific capacity of this kind of battery reaches 1008 mAh g(-1). After 100 cycles, the specific capacity keeps at 611 mAh g(-1) with the capacity retention rate above 60% and coulombic efficiency close to 100%. Compared with the traditional sulfur cathode material, this terpolymer cathode material exhibits higher capacity, better cycle performance, and superior high-rate performance. In addition, it can be directly coated on the aluminum foil collector without additional binders, which reduces the internal resistance effect from additional binders and simplifies the battery assembly process.

Due to the chemical interaction between electrodes and intermediates produced in charging and discharging process, the Janus-polar two dimensional (2D) electrode materials can enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery by overcoming shuttle effect and increasing diffusion rates. Here, it is explored the structural, electronic, and dynamic characteristics of Li ion, S-8 cluster, and lithium polysulfides adsorbed over Janus Phosphorus Nitride monolayer with blue phosphorene phase (b-PN) by using first-principles calculations. The reported findings highlight potential of the b-PN monolayer as a good host material, given that the large absorption energies of different clusters vary from -0.47 to -3.78 eV, which can suppress shuttle effect effectively. These strong adsorptions are origin from the chemical interaction between nitrogen atoms of the b-PN and Li atoms in lithium polysulfides in present work. Particularly, it is predicted that b-PN monolayer has extremely small diffusion barriers for Li ion and Li2S8 clusters of 0.10 and 0.03 eV, which leading to a higher battery charge and discharge rate than reported graphene and MoS2. It is hoped that this efficient strategy for promising host materials of sulfur-electrode guides the development of next-generation lithium-sulfur batteries.

Here we report an effective sulfur host material prepared by implanting cerium oxide (CeO2) nanocrystals homogeneously into well-designed bimodal micromesoporous nitrogen-rich carbon (MMNC) nano spheres. With the high conductivity and abundant hierarchical pore structures, MMNC nanospheres can effectively store and entrap sulfur species. Moreover, the inserted polar and electrocatalytically active CeO2 nanocrystals and high nitrogen content of MMNC can synergistically solve the hurdle of the polysulfide dissolution and furthermore significantly promote stable redox activity. By combining these advantages, CeO2/MMNC-S cathodes with 1.4 mg cm(-2) sulfur exhibit high reversible capacities (1066 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 200 cycles and 836 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C after 500 cycles), good rate capability (737 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C), and high cycle stability (721 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C after 1000 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.024% per cycle). Furthermore, a high and stable reversible capacity of 611 mAh g(-1) is achieved after cycling for 200 cycles with higher sulfur loading of 3.4 mg cm(-2).

These batteries exhibit a high initial discharge capacity (> 1500 mAh g(-1)). Sulfur, acetylene black, and the solid electrolyte Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4 are mixed by planetary ball milling to form composites that contain amorphous phases of the starting materials, as well as a byproduct with a novel structural unit arising from the reaction between sulfur and the solid electrolyte. Batteries with a composite electrode/Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4/Li-In anode configuration exhibit a high initial discharge capacity (> 1100 mAh g(-1)). However, the capacity fades during cycling (similar to 500 mAh g(-1) at the 30th cycle), possibly because of the increased resistance of the composite. Structural and compositional changes of the byproduct and the solid electrolyte itself during the battery reaction could contribute to the increase in resistance that cause the deterioration of cyclability.

The carbon nanofibers showed a well-designed pore structure: centered macropores are surrounded by a denser cycle consisting of micro-/mesopores near the surface. Sulfur was encapsulated into the pores by solution penetration, followed by a melt diffusion method to generate a flexible sulfur/HPCNF (S/HPCNF) cloth as the binder-free cathode in lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The HPCNF carbon with multi-scaled pores acts as an efficient host for large amounts of sulfur, and accommodates the associated volume expansion during electrochemical cycling. Moreover, the hierarchical architecture significantly reduces the escape of polysulfides during the cycling. The unique material allowed sulfur loading of 2.2 -12.1 mg cm(-2), and exhibited a high sulfur utilization of more than 80% with high areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm(-2), demonstrating that S/HPCNF is a promising cathode material for Li-S batteries of high energy density.

Toluene-soluble (TS), toluene-insoluble and pyridine-soluble (PS), pyridine insoluble (PI) fractions were separated by extracting pitch with different solvents followed by the activation using alkali KOH to obtain porous carbons which were used as sulfur host materials. It is found that different fractions possess different reactivity which mainly relies on the molecular weight and structures. The light component TS, equipped with more active sites, tends to be activated to porous carbon with well-developed pores and it promotes the optimal distribution of sulfur compared to heavy fractions PS and PI. When used as sulfur host, TS-based carbon displays better electrochemical performance compared to PS/PI-based carbon. The relationship between the structure and electrochemical performance of fraction-based porous carbon has been established. The findings provide a method for judging and regulating the structure and electrochemical performance of porous carbons derived from pitch-based precursors. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

To address such issues, Fe-Nx sites enriched microporous nanoflowers planted with tangled bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (Fe-Nx-C/Fe3C-CNTs NFs) are found to be effective catalytic mediators with strong anchoring capabilities for LiPSs. The bamboo-like carbon nanotubes catalyzed by Fe3C/Fe entangled each other to form a conductive network, which encloses a flower-like microporous carbon core with embedded well-dispersed Fe-Nx active sites. As expected, electrons smoothly transfer along the dense conductive bamboo-like carbon network while the flower-like carbon core consisting of micropores induces the homogeneous distribution of tiny sulfur and favors the lithium ions migration with all directions. Meanwhile, Fe-Nx sites strongly trap long-chain LiPSs with chemical anchoring, and catalyze the redox conversion of LiPSs. Due to the aforementioned synergistic effects, the S@Fe-Nx-C/Fe3C-CNTs NFs cathode exhibited a remarkable specific capacity (635 mAh g(s)(-1)) at 3 C and a favorable capacity decay with 0.04% per cycle even after 400 cycles at 1 C.

Herein, a highly efficient conductive network is developed by growing herringbone structured carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on the surface of graphene aerogel (GA-CNFs-Ni) and is further applied as a functional coating layer in Li-S batteries. The conductive coating layer, serves as both a shield to trap the active materials detached from the cathode and a conductive "second current collector" to reactivate the trapped active materials. The herringbone structured CNFs enriched with defects and gaps enlarge the available reaction site for electrons, the electrolyte and sulfur species, ensuring the smooth operation of the sulfur cathode with high loading and high content. In addition, the uniformly distributed Ni nanoparticles also exert strong chemical bonding with polysulfides by first-principle calculations. Consequently, the GA-CNFs-Ni coated separator enables the "double high" sulfur cathode (5 mg cm(-2), 90 wt%) to display an ultrastable cycle capability and superior rate performance. Moreover, a high sulfur loading of 10 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (6 mL mg(-1)) are obtained, delivering a high areal capacity of 5.5 mA h cm(-2) after 60 cycles.

Moreover, the addition of insulating binder in the electrode increases the internal resistance, reducing specific capacity and rate performance. Herein, we develop a composite binder with higher electronic conductivity, superior mechanical property and strong adsorption of polysulfides that imparts it some electrocatalytic activity. The reduced graphene oxide-polyacrylic acid (GOPAA) binder is prepared via a simple solution process. At constant loading fraction of 10 wt%, using GOPAA binder induces a 30% enhancement in the cathode capacity, better cycle life and rate capability compared to using PAA binder, reducing both the local charge-transfer resistance and the global electronic resistance before and after cycling. These are attributed to the enhanced binding strength and synergistic effect of reduced graphene oxide and PAA forming well-dispersed conductive bridges to promote rapid electron transfer. Additionally, GOPAA provides active sites for adsorption of lithium polysulfides and electrocatalytic activity, shifting redox peaks in cyclic voltammetry and improving roundtrip efficiency.

However, their performance is limited by polysulfide shuttling problem and sluggish kinetics of Li-S reactions. Notorious polysulfide shuttling can be effectively overcome by physicochemical adsorption of polysulfides in porous electrodes. Thereafter, slow conversion rate of polysulfide adsorbed on the electrode emerged as a new bottle-neck issue to Li-S battery performance. Herein, we report an bifunctional metal-nitrogen-carbon electrocatalytic electrode made of Co-embedded N-doped graphitic carbon decorated on free-standing N-doped carbon fabric for electrocatalysis of polysulfide conversion and the understanding on its electrocatalytic effect. The Co-embedded N-doped graphitic carbon is identified as the bifunctional active center to electrocatalytically accelerate the oxidation of Li2S and the polysulfide conversion. First-principles calculations reveals that the graphitic N sites neighbored to Co in carbon matrix exhibit the modest reactivity for strong yet favorable adsorption/dissociation of polysulfide species. It leads to greatly reduced energy and kinetics barrier for polysulfide conversion without weakening the polysulfide adsorption on the electrode. The integrated and hierarchically porous electrode design further maximizes the electrocatalytic effect in thick electrode with high sulfur loading. The electrocatalytic electrodes with sulfur loading up to 6.5 mg cm(-2) can be directly applied in LiS batteries without tedious electrode fabrication, exhibiting very low capacity decay rate of 0.034% for 500 cycles and excellent high-rate capability up to 5 C. This work may provide the new insight into the understanding on vital role and chemical nature of electrocatalysis in promoting Li-S battery performance.

We develop a cobalt nanoparticle-encapsulated carbon nanowire arrays on carbon cloth (CC@Co-CNAs) to enable the fast redox reaction kinetics of the lithium sulfur batteries. The nanowire array-decorated carbon cloth as conductive matrix for sulfur active material could provide highly exposed cobalt nanoparticle active sites, owing to the high length-diameter ratio of the prepared CC@Co-CNAs. The binding affinity between the cobalt nanoparticle-incorporated materials and polysulfide intermediates is enhanced by Co-S bonds, which facilitates the redox reaction of active materials and consequently results in a high sulfur utilization for cathode especially with high sulfur loading. The lithium sulfur battery with CC@Co-CNAs as electrode materials delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1228 mAh g(-1) at 0.25 C, and a high initial discharge capacity of 807 mAh g(-1) at 1C with a low capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle during 300 cycles. Moreover, a discharge capacity of 958 mAhg(-1 )at 0.1 C is achieved for the cell even with a corresponding sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm(-2) . (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, various refined nanomaterials or carbon-based hosts possess low density, high surface area, and large porosity, leading to undesirable reduction on both gravimetric and volumetric energy densities. Herein, spherical metal oxides with high tap density are introduced as carbon-free hosts of sulfur for the first time. The ternary oxides show a superior synergistic effect of adsorption and electrocatalytic conversion of soluble intermediate polysulfides. Besides, oxide microspheres can build stable conductive frameworks and open channels in porous electrodes for fast transport of electrons and active diffusion of electrolyte. Such a synergistic effect and unique structural feature of porous electrodes are favorable for achieving good utilization and stable cycle performance of the sulfur cathode. Typically, the S/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 composite exhibits good cycle stability with a low capacity decay rate (0.057% per cycle) during 500 cycles at 0.1 C. Importantly, due to the high tap density (1.81 g cm(-3)), the S/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 composite delivers a larger volumetric capacity (1601.9 mAh cm(-composite)(-3)) almost 2.3 times of S/carbon composite (689.4 rnAh CM-composite-3). Therefore, this work provides a feasible strategy to reach long life and high volumetric capacity of cathode based on metal oxides as sulfur hosts.

Herein, the utilization of microporous (d<2 nm) carbon/sulfur composites using a carbonate-based electrolyte is studied to obtain more insights into the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the cathode surface in Li-S cells. The sulfur was confined in model carbide-derived carbon (CDC) system with uniform micropores as well as in commercial microporous activated carbon materials. The molecular structure of sulfur in the pores is characterized by means of EXAFS spectroscopy. The electrochemical evaluation of confined sulfur cathodes revealed quasi solid-state transformation mechanism as well as the generation of a protective SEI layer on the cathode surface. This cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) allows common microporous carbon/sulfur cathodes to reversibly cycle in carbonate-based electrolyte, while mesoporous systems show rapid capacity fade due to leaky CEIs. Based on this result, the influence of the porosity of the porous carbon host materials on the essential cathodic SEI layer formation is discussed for carbonate-based electrolytes in Li-S batteries.

However, some obstacles still hinder the practical use of lithium-sulfur batteries, which are mainly caused by the poor electronic conductivity and polysulfide migration. To deal with these problems, hollow TiO(2)spheres wrapped in graphene (HTOS/G) composites are developed and used as host materials for sulfur particles. Due to the synthetic effect of improving electronic conductivity and inhibiting the polysulfide migration by employing HTOS/G as host materials, the as-prepared HTOS/G-S composites exhibit high specific capacity and excellent cycling stability. The initial specific capacity is as high as 1263 mAh g(-1)at 0.1C. The HTOS/G-S composites display high capacity retention of 87.8% after 300 cycles at the current density of 2C.

However, the defects in battery electrodes seriously hinder commercial applications, such as the shuttle effect of polysulfides and the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites. In this work, a modified separator with a sandwich-like structure was prepared using nanoscale flower-like strontium fluoride and graphene, which were filtered onto a PP separator. The strontium fluoride graphene (SrF2-G) sandwich separator can effectively inhibit the shuttling of polysulfides, promote the rapid transfer of ions and electrons, and also effectively inhibit the irregular growth of lithium dendrites. This mainly benefits the efficient physical barrier effect and strong chemical catalysis, and the unique structure leads to high conductivity. The SrF2-G-based battery exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, including a high initial discharge capacity of 1140 mA h g(-1) that is maintained at 873 mA h g(-1) over 300 cycles at 0.5C, a high-rate performance of 878 mA h g(-1) at 3C, and an extremely low capacity decay rate of 0.05% at 1C after 350 cycles. This work solves the inherent problems of lithium sulfur batteries to some extent and provides insight for practical applications in the future.

In this paper, we designed and prepared a waterborne polyurethane/polyacrylic acid/graphene (WPU/PAA/GN) multi-functional composite binder. The polyoxyethylene segments in WPU are used to promote the migration of lithium ions and provide high elongation. The introduction of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and graphene forms a double hydrogen bond network through simple in situ blending, which gives the binder higher strength and electronic conductivity. More importantly, the physical crosslinking of PAA and WPU can achieve high resilience and ensure the integrity of the cathode structure during charging and discharging. In addition, abundant polar functional groups provide strong chemical adsorption for lithium polysulfide. The synergistic effect of various components makes the binder possess the functions of high resilience, good electrical conductivity, and strong adsorption, which provides a simple and effective solution for the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries. As a result, the assembled lithium-sulfur battery displayed a high initial discharge capacity of 1243 mAh g(-1), good cycle stability (81% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.5 C) and superior rate performance.

But the practical use of a Li-S battery is still hindered by its rapid capacity decay owing to the polysulfide dissolution. In spite of much efforts in combining sulfur with porous carbon materials to suppress the dissolution of the polysulfide, relatively little attention has been paid to the role of silica in polysulfide adsorption. Herein, an efficient strategy is applied to limit the polysulfide dissolution by using a silica coated sulfur/vaporgrown carbon fiber composite (S/VGCF@SiO2) as the cathode material for the Li-S battery. The as-prepared S/VGCF@SiO2 composite exhibits better cycle stability and higher rate performance, compared with the bare S/VGCF composite. This improved performance is mainly due to the introduction of SiO2, which can effectively inhibit the "shuttle effect" of polysulfide.

To address these persistent challenges in a unified manner, a dual-function, flexible, free-standing framework by coupling catalytic and lithiophilic 1T '-MoTe2 nanosheets with conductive carbon nanotubes (MoTe2-CNT), which serve as a host for both a sulfur cathode (S/MoTe2-CNT) and a lithium-metal anode (MoTe2-CNT/Li) is presented here. MoTe2-CNT not only guides a uniform growth of lithium within the framework, but also forms a thin, unique sulfide-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) composed of lithium thiotellurate on the Li surface when paired with a sulfur cathode. This SEI stabilizes Li deposition, suppresses electrolyte decomposition, and prevents Li loss, thereby prolonging cycle life. Full coin cells with a very low negative to positive electrode capacity ratio of approximate to 2.5 and a high areal capacity of 7.6 mA h cm(-2) display 75% capacity retention after 500 cycles. The pouch cells fabricated with MoTe2-CNT deliver a high capacity of 1533 mA h g(-1) and energy density of 319 Wh kg(-1) at a low electrolyte-to-capacity ratio of approximate to 2.9 mu L [mA h](-1) and a low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio of 4.5 mu L mg(-1).

However, challenges arising from the nature of materials have plagued the commercialization of this technology, among which the notorious shuttle effect, serious volume expansion and insulating nature of sulfur and its low order reduced products are key problems. Constructing nanocomposites of sulfur with heteroatom-doped carbon nanostructures is an efficient and promising approach. However, there are limited reports on boron and oxygen dual doping treatment used in lithium-sulfur batteries, let alone explaining an in-depth mechanism. Herein, we prepared boron and oxygen dually doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (BO-MWNTs) as the host material for sulfur. With the successful introduction of boron and oxygen, the electrical conductivity of the carbon material is obviously increased. Furthermore, the effect of doped heteroatoms on the carbon/sulfur (C/S) composites and its mechanistic understanding are explored and confirmed via both experiments and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that B and O dual dopants can offer abundant adsorptive sites and lead to strong chemisorption between the carbon and the sulfides. This dual doping treatment leads to improved cycling stability and rate capability performance of the C/S cathode. Hence, the proposed innovative mechanistic understanding of boron and oxygen doping on carbon materials is hopeful to shed light on the designing principle for advanced C/S composites.

The CNTs with extraordinary conductivity supply more electron transport to the cathode and make much more sense in enhancing the rate performance of the sulfur cathode. In the matrix, cobalt nanoparticles and hetero-atom nitrogen can help in immobilizing sulfur species, leading to the improvement of polysulfide shutting. Moreover, the increased specific surface area and mesoporous channel enhance the sulfur loading and facilitate electrolyte diffusion. On integrating these fascinating benefits into one electrode material, as a result, the hybrid composite (CNT@CoeNeC/S) cathode presents a high initial capacity of 1316.1 mAh/g at the current rate of 0.1C. Even at high current rate of 5C, a decent capacity of 620.7 mAh/g can still be achieved. The capacity of hybrids materials can be maintained at 970 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 0.2C, and a capacity retention of 79.8%, revealing it great potential for energy storage application.

The PCs with various surface microstructures were used as hosts for sulfur, and their electrochemical performances were investigated systematically. The KOH activated carbon exhibited not only a maximum specific surface area, 2287.3 m(2) g(-1) but also a broadened pore size distribution, 2.60 to 3.87 nm, as well as a large pore volume, 1.273 cm(3) g(-1), leading to a high sulfur content, 71 wt%. Interestingly, the KOH activated carbon-sulfur composite (CS) exhibited superior electrochemical performances. The initial discharge capacity under 0.1C, 1350 mA h g(-1) was obtained. After 100 cycles under 0.2C, the capacity of 750 mA h g(-1) was maintained. When the current density increased to a 1C the capacity of 728 mA h g(-1) was reached, but only capacities of 360 mA h g(-1) and 264 mAhg(-1) were reached, respectively, for the ZnCl2-and H3PO4-CS samples. The improved electrochemical performances were due to the lowest resistance of charge transfer from the SEI layer (R-s) and the interfacial electrons (A(ct)). Both reduced resistances were attributed to the microstructural features that suppress the polysulfide dissolution.

Nevertheless, the low utilization of active materials and detrimental shuttle reactions severely inhibit the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a lightweight 2D boron doped g-C3N4 nanosheets (BCN) with abundant active sites and increased conductivity prepared by a facile route is introduced onto commercial separators to achieve high performance Li-S batteries. The prepared BCN displays a 2D thin layer nanosheet structure with a thickness of 2.5 nm. The boron doping not only can increase surface area and improve electrical conductivity, but also chemically anchor more polysulfides due to the formed B-N bond, which can effectively minimize the shuttling of polysulfides through the synergistic effect of physical yield and chemical confinement. As a result, the assembled Li-S batteries employing BCN separators with multifunction display large discharge capacity of 1197 mAh g(-1), high sulfur utilization and outstanding durability with a capacity decay rate of 0.09% per cycle at 1 C after 500 cycles, which are also supported by the density functional theory simulation. Additionally, the alleviated self-discharge behavior and good areal capacity (up to 6.4 mAh cm(-2)) at a high sulfur loading of the cell are also demonstrated. The exploration of BCN modified separator furnishes a viable way to construct high energy density and long lifespan Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Unfortunately, the insulating nature and shuttling effect of sulfur are crucial obstacles. In this study, a "network-sphere" structure of in-situ reduced Sn modifying SnO2 nanospheres embedded in carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) porous nanofiber network (CBC@SnO2-Sn) is designed via two-step thermal treatment as 3D sulfur host material for LSBs to overcome these issues. The CBC exerts a positive role in alleviating the volume change as well as accelerating the electron and ion transfer. More significantly, the uniformly distributed SnO2 nanospheres with in-situ reduced Sn not only provide numerous active sites for chemisorption of polysulfides, but also accelerate the redox kinetics by catalyzing the polysulfides conversion, coordinately alleviating the shuttle effect during cycling. The CBC@SnO2-Sn/S cathode delivers an outstanding electrochemical performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 1573.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and superior cycling stability (564.6 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 3 A g-1 with the coulombic efficiency kept above 99%). The novel structure, with synergy effect between conductive network and polysulfide adsorption-conversion, creates a promising strategy in improving the electrochemical performance for LSBs and other energy storage applications.

In this direction, we design a unique sulfur host derived from a honeycomb-like, porous nitrogen-doped carbon framework consisting of MoC with a three-dimensional architecture (H-MoC-NC) as both the adsorbent and catalyst for high-rate and long-lasting lithium-sulfur batteries. The interconnected carbon skeletons with a nitrogen-doped polar surface induce uniform sulfur distribution and fast charge transfer, which are supplied with strong physical confinement and the high-efficiency reaction of sulfur species. The adsorptive/catalytic MoC planes with maximized exposure endow sulfiphilic and catalytic sites that improve the ion conduction, chemical interaction, and redox kinetics in polysulfide regulation. Owing to the synergistic mode between conductive and catalytic functions, sulfur electrodes based on S/H-MoC-NC are characterized by enhanced battery performance with low polarization, high initial discharge capacity (1316 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C), superior rate capacities (646 mA h g(-1) at 3C), and decent cycling durability with a minimized capacity fading rate of 0.049% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 3C. The work not only probes the design of conductive and catalytic networks to be a promising architecture, but also demonstrates the enormous potential of MoC as an effective sulfur host for high-performance in the Li-S chemistry.

Herein, a novel multifunctional graphene oxide-Zn(II)-triazole complex (denoted as GO-Zn(II)-AmTZ) with excellent property at low temperature(-20 degrees C) is successfully prepared. In GO-Zn(II)-AmTZ, the metal ions (Zn(II)), amine groups and the N penta-heterocycle are introduced synchronously, leading improvement of Li-S performance at both room and low temperature. As a result of the multifunctional arrangement, GO-Zn(II)-AmTZ cathodes could provide a discharge capacity of 315 mAh g(-1) (0.5C) after 100 cycles at -20 degrees C. A capacity of similar to 520 mAh g(-1) is achieved over 300 cycles at room temperature with low capacity attenuation rate at current rate of 0.5C. The improved performance is speculated to the contribution of enhanced polysulfide immobilization of GO-Zn(II)-AmTZ modified by the Zn(II), amine groups and the N atoms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its chemical structure and electrochemical properties have been poorly understood. In this discussion, we analyze the previously published data in combination with our own results to propose a more reasonable chemical structure that consists of short -S-x- chains covalently bonded onto cyclized, partially dehydrogenated, and ribbon-like polyacrylonitrile backbones. The proposed structure fits all previous structural characterizations and explains many unique electrochemical phenomena that were observed from the Li/SPAN cells but have not been understood clearly.

The ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets can provide remarkable binding strength, large surface area and fast charge transfer, therefore leading to favorable chemical interaction with polysulfides in Li-S batteries. Accompanied with the synergistic effects between physical confinement of porous carbon and chemical interactions of SnS2, S/C-SnS2 composites with different mass ratio of ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets and C show much improved electrochemical properties. Among them, S/C-SnS2 composite with 10 wt% of ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets and 75 wt% of sulfur maintains superior long term cycling capacities of 800 mAhg(-1) at 0.5 C after 300 cycles and 540 mAhg(-1) at 2 C after 700 cycles.

However, the development of LiSBs is facing many obstacles, such as the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur, shuttling effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), sluggish Li2S decomposition, and low discharging/charging efficiency. Suitable electrocatalysts that can solve the above problems are promising in the development of LiSBs. Herein, 13 two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frame-works (MOFs) of nitrogen-, sulfur-, and oxygen-coordinated transition-metal (TM) atoms (Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) are selected and constructed to reveal the structure-activity relationship of 2D MOFs in terms of the electrocatalytic performance. Among all the 2D MOFs investigated, Cu-3(HITP)(2), Zn-3(HITP)(2), and Cu-3(C18H9O3N3)(2) offer moderate binding strength to LiPSs, which effectively suppresses Li2Sn dissolution and shuttling. Cu-3(HITP)(2) exhibits good electrical conductivity, a low Gibbs free energy barrier, effective electrocatalytic ability for Li2Sn decomposition, and a high sulfur loading amount. A descriptor phi is proposed to correlate the binding energies of the 2D MOFs to the coordination environment and the electronegativity of the TM atoms in the LiPSs via an implicit volcano plot. These findings are helpful for understanding the electrocatalytic effect of 2D MOFs in LiSBs and represent a promising approach for the development of future LiSBs.

The PTBT featured the polythiophene-structure main chain as a highly conducting framework and the benzenethiol side chain to copolymerize with sulfur and form a crosslinked organosulfur polymer (namely S/PTBT). Meanwhile, it could be in-situ deposited on the current collector by electro-polymerization, making it a binder-free and free-standing cathode for Li-S batteries. The S/PTBT cathode exhibited a reversible capacity of around 870 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and improved cycling performance compared to the physically mixed cathode (namely S&PTBT). This multifunction cathode eliminated the influence of the additives (carbon/binder), making it suitable to be applied as a model electrode for operando analysis. Operando X-ray imaging revealed the remarkable effect in the suppression of polysulfides shuttle via introducing covalent bonds, paving the way for the study of the intrinsic mechanisms in Li-S batteries.

A series of ultrathin hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets (HPCNs) is fabricated through carbonization of precursors obtained through the Friedel-Crafts reaction-assisted loading of polystyrene on graphene oxide. Hierarchical pore structures consist of three parts: (1) the micropores (1.3 nm), which were provided by porous polystyrene through the Friedel-Crafts reaction; (2) the mesopores (3.8 nm), which were provided by slab pores from the stack of carbon nanosheets; and (3) the pores (>5 nm) formed from the random stack of carbon nanosheets. Controlling the carbonization time and temperature adds to a prominent increase in specific surface area from 405.8 to 1420 m(2) g(-1). It was found that excessive carbonization would destroy the hierarchical pore structure. These porous carbon materials were used as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur battery and showed good performance. HPCN/sulfur cathode has good rate performance and cycle performance, and the capacity retention rate is 87% after the current density rises from 1 to 3 C and 91% after 200 cycles.

The sluggish redox kinetics of the electrochemistry and the high solubility of polysulfides during cycling result in insufficient sulfur utilization, severe polarization, and poor cyclic stability. Herein, sulfiphilic few-layered MoSe2 nanoflakes decorated rGO (MoSe2@rGO) hybrid has been synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method and for the first time, is used as a conceptually new-style sulfur host for LSBs. Specifically, MoSe2@rGO not only strongly interacts with polysulfides but also dynamically strengthens polysulfide redox reactions. The polarization problem is effectively alleviated by relying on the sulfiphilic MoSe2. Moreover, MoSe2@rGO is demonstrated to be beneficial for the fast nucleation and uniform deposition of Li2S, contributing to the high discharge capacity and good cyclic stability.

Herein, we report a novel cathode composite composed of "moss-like" P-doped NiSe2 arrays grown on activated carbon cloth substrates (P-NiSe2/ACC). Experiments and DFT calculations together suggest that P-doping enhances the electron transfers between P-NiSe2 and LiPSs, leading to improved chemical adsorptions and catalytic effects towards the redox conversions of the active sulfur species. This effectively inhibits the shuttling of LiPSs and maximizes the utilization of sulfur towards high specific capacities and stable long-term cycling at high sulfur loadings. The strong interactions and effective catalysis of P-NiSe2 on LiPSs also enables three-dimensional growth of Li2S2/Li2S on the P-NiSe2/ACC cathode, realizing effective accommodation of volume expansions and significant alleviation of cathode passivation. As a result, the P-NiSe2/ACC cathode provides a high specific capacity of 1211 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and an outstanding high-rate performance of 679 mAh g(-1) at 3 C. At the high sulfur loading of 9.9 mg cm(-2), an area capacity of 8.42 mAh cm(-2) is achieved with stable cycling for 100 charge discharge cycles. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, previously reported carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or carbon composite-based interlayers can be easily blocked by LiPS adsorption and impede the transmission of lithium ions due to the lack of rationally designed porous structures. Here, we prepared a hierarchical porous Fe3C-C/CNT membrane interlayer with rapid ion-transport macropores and hierarchical polysulfide-trapping mesopores via a convenient and scalable phase inversion approach for high-energy-density Li-S batteries. The rationally designed porous structure of Fe3C-C/CNT interlayers significantly provides a good environment for the fast transportation of Li+ ions and electrons, and it simultaneously effectively restrains the shuttle effect by the chemical adsorption energy of the Fe3C nanoparticles toward soluble LiPSs. As a result, due to the self-supporting (FeC)-C-3-C/CNT interlayer, batteries with high sulfur loading (7.06 mg cm(-2)) and a low ratio of electrolyte to sulfur (5.7 mu L mg(-1)) can exhibit a high areal capacity up to 4.32 mA h cm(-2), achieving high gravimetric specific energy (1560 W h kg-1) and volumetric specific energy (1694 W h L-1). This facile approach of membrane interlayer fabrication and structural design provides a promising future for practical applications of LiS batteries.

However, the shuttling effect of soluble polysulfides and low electrical conductivity of sulfur and Li2S still hinder its commercialization. In this work, high electrical-conductive carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with uniformly embedded polytungstates (HPW@CNFs) are proposed for advanced Li-S batteries. H3PW12O40 (HPW) is a kind of molecular nano-sized metal cluster which contains rich Lewis acid/base sites that can stabilize polysulfide effectively through chemical bonding, while CNFs play the role of physical barriers for polysulfides and transmission channel for electrons. The HPW@CNFs/S cathode shows an ultra-stable cycling performance with extremely small decay rate of 0.015% per cycle over 400 cycles at 0.5 C.

While the poor conductivity of sulfur, the volume effect and 'shuttle effect' during charge and discharge, and slow redox kinetics of polysulfide intermediates still limit the practical application. To solve these problems, we synthesize a valid 3D hybrid material (Co9S8@N-CHS) of nanosized Co9S8 evenly distributed on N-doped carbon hollow spheres with strong chemical coupling by in situ carbonization of Co(NO3)(2)@resorcinol/formaldehyde and sulfidation. It presents a high electronic conductivity, absorbing chemical adsorption capability to polysulfides and can catalyze the sulfur redox processes. Compared with S/AC and S/N-CHS electrodes, S/Co9S8@N-CHS electrodes achieve an excellent initial discharge specific capacity of 1337 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and a long cycle life with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.027% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C and the coulombic efficiency is above 99%. Consequently, it is an effective sulfur host material for high performance Li-S batteries.

However, the notorious shuttling of polysulfides severely hinders their widespread applications. Herein, we report an efficient polysulfide double-blocking strategy that simultaneously employs the in-situ formed sulfur encapsulated in porous carbon materials (S@C) as cathode and metal-organic framework-derived CoS2 nanosheets as polar interlayer to fabricate highly-stable Li-S batteries. The S particles with high loading of 71% are uniformly confined within the large voids and cavities of porous carbon skeleton, and the carbon shell could control the cathodic volume, ensure the fast ionic transfer, and physically confine the polysulfides. Further, the nanosheet-like CoS2 interlayer presents strong chemical adsorption of polysulfides, as confirmed by the experiments and DFT calculations. As a result, the strong synergistic effect of S@C cathode and CoS2 interlayer yields superior Li-S batteries with high initial capacity (1271 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C), remarkably enhanced rate capability and excellent cyclability with a quite low fading rate of 0.136% per cycle. Therefore, our proposed strategy of double blocking polysulfides will offer new ways for achieving high-stable and long-lifetime Li-S batteries.

And then AB/S/polypyrrole (AB/S/PPy) ternary composite is prepared by chemical oxidation polymerization method. AB is an effective sulfur storage substrate, and its chain-like structure provides a good basis for the rapid transmission of lithium ions and electrons. PPy as an outermost coating layer not only alleviates volume expansion but also effectively inhibits the shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) during charge and discharge process. The experimental results demonstrate that the addition of carbon and the conductive polymer significantly contributes to improving the electrochemical performance of AB/S/PPy composite cathode. At a current density of 200 mA g(-1), the initial specific discharge capacity of AB/S/PPy composite cathode is 1090 mAh g(-1), and retains 577 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. In comparison, AB/S composite and pure sulfur electrode exhibit poor electrochemical performance. Therefore, all the experimental results indicate that AB/S/PPy ternary composite is a potential cathode material for LSBs.

J	Li, TT; He, C; Zhang, WX				Li, Tongtong; He, Cheng; Zhang, Wenxue			A novel porous C4N4 monolayer as a potential anchoring material for lithium-sulfur battery design	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							DOPED GRAPHENE; POLYSULFIDES; BORON; PHOSPHORENE; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; DIFFUSION; IRON; CO	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to high theoretical specific energy and environmental friendliness. However, the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) has become a major obstacle for developing Li-S batteries. In this work, we explored a new C4N4 monolayer, which could be easily prepared from its bulk form using a similar mechanical exfoliation approach to that of graphene due to its smaller exfoliation energy. The C4N4 monolayer could suppress the shuttling of LiPSs and produce significant improvement in the cycling performance of Li-S batteries. Moreover, adsorption calculations revealed that polysulfide captured by C4N4 was chemisorbed with a suitable range of adsorption energies from -1.931 to -3.119 eV. Furthermore, excellent surface diffusions of LiPSs on C4N4 resulted in a fast charge/discharge rate. Moreover, to improve the electrical conductivity of C4N4, graphyne was selected to construct a C4N4/graphyne heterostructure. Based on these remarkable results, we conclude that C4N4 is a highly promising anchoring material for Li-S batteries. We hope that our studies will inspire more experimental and theoretical studies on exploring the potential of other 2D nanostructures as lithium-sulfur battery hosts.

The results indicate that the porous nanocomposite enhances the electrolyte infiltrate into the cathode materials evenly, has a good capability of confining the soluble polysulfides and preventing the aggregation of insoluble Li2S. The regenerated elemental sulfur of the porous sulfur/ carbon nanocomposite cathode exists in nano-size particles in the pore and the resistance decreases compared with the original cathode. Moreover, the porous nanocomposite realizes the micro-reactors during the discharge charge process and can accommodate the volume change which is benefit for stabilization of the cathode during the electrochemical reaction.

However, low practical energy density and poor cycling life are obstacles to the practical application of Li-S batteries. A highly conductive and lightweight poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate-carbon nanotube (PEDOT:PSS-CNT) interlayer for Li-S batteries has been fabricated. The PEDOT:PSS-CNT interlayer not only acts as a soft buffer to scavenge excess lithium polysulfides in the pores and restricts polysulfides from migrating to the lithium anode by chemical absorption, but also serves as an assisted current collector to improve the electronic conductivity for the sulfur cathode. With these synergistic contributions, pure sulfur cathode with the PEDOT:PSS-CNT interlayer shows a high capacity (921mAhg(-1)at 0.5C; 1C=1675mAhg(-1)), enhanced cycling performance (a capacity retention of 70.9% after 200cycles), and good rate performance. The excellent electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode plus the easy fabrication of such a functional interlayer bring feasible Li-S batteries for practical applications one step closer.

A commercial Nafion ionomer, which can reduce thiosulfate sodium to sulfur insitu, owing to its acidity, provides immobile lithium ions after lithium exchange in the nanocomposite to attract the negatively charged polysulfide species for reduction during discharge. The capacity decay of the second cycle discharge, which is about 25% of the value for a conventional carbon-sulfur composite, is reduced to about 3% by introducing Nafion into the nanocomposite, and the capacity retention of this novel carbon-Nafion-sulfur nanocomposite is improved by more than 100% during long-term battery operation.

Oxygen vacancies (OVs), the common defects in metal oxides, are often used to immobilize and catalyze lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). However, little effort has been devoted to developing novel oxygen defects manufacturing strategies and controlling its concentration to obtain an ideal effect. Herein, defect-rich electrocatalysts composed of In2O3-x nanoparticles and carbon spheres (CS) for Li-S batteries are reported by hydrothermal composition. Both experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that an appropriate quantity of oxygen vacancies can enhance the chemical adsorption and catalytic ability of LiPSs. As expected, the In2O3-x @CS-0.6/rGO-based cell displays an outstanding rate performance of 872 mAh g(-1) at 3 C and a low fading rate of 0.058% each cycle after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, as well as a favorable areal capacity of 6.98 mAh cm(-2) under high sulfur mass loading of 6.81 mg cm(-2). This work furnishes a newness strategy to the rational design of oxygen vacancies of metal oxides and boosts the development of defect engineering in electrochemical applications.

However, recent studies have mainly focused on the singular function of the catalyst, i.e., either oxidation or reduction of polysulfides. As such, the goal of rapid cycling of sulfur species remains to be highly desired. Herein, a Pt-carbide composite as a bifunctional catalyst was developed to simultaneously accelerate both the reduction of soluble polysulfides and the oxidation of insoluble Li2S/Li2S2. Typically, a Pt-NbC composite was synthesized by growing Pt nanoparticles on the surface of NbC, and the resultant intimate interface in the hybrid is a key component for the bifunctional catalysis. During the reduction process, polysulfides could be grabbed on the surface of NbC via strong adsorption, and then these trapped polysulfides could be catalytically converted by Pt nanoparticles. During the oxidation process, both NbC and Pt exhibited catalytic activities for the dissolution of Li2S. This process could lead to the renewal of the surface of the catalyst. By combining the sulfur cathode with a Pt-NbC-CNT (Pt-NbC anchored on a carbon nanotube)-coated separator, the cell was able to demonstrate a high initial capacity of 1382 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.2C. Furthermore, the cell was able to achieve an exceptional rate capability of 795 mAh g(-1) at 5C, and it was also able to show significantly inhibited self-discharge behavior. Thus, this work explores the catalyst design and the mechanism of a bifunctional catalyst for the performance enhancement in Li-S cells.

Effects of Photochemical Oxidation of the Carbonaceous Additives on Li-S Cell Performance	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						photochemical oxidation; oxygen functional group; carbonaceous material; multidimensional carbon; lithium-sulfur battery	HIGH-SULFUR; LITHIUM; CATHODE; CHALLENGES; FUTURE	We introduce a simple and easy way to functionalize the surface of various carbonaceous materials through the ultraviolet light/ozone (UV/O-3) plasma where we utilize the zero-, one-, and two-dimensional carbon frameworks. In a general manner, the lamps of a UV/O-3 generator create two different wavelengths (lambda = 185 and 254 nm); the shorter wavelength (lambda = 185 nm) dissociates the oxygen (O-2) in air and the longer wavelength (lambda = 254 nm) dissociates the O-3 and creates the reactive and monoatomic oxygen radical, which tends to incorporate onto the defects of the carbons. By tailoring the association and dissociation of the oxygen with various forms, carbon black, carbon nanofibers, and graphite flakes, chosen as representative models for the zero-, one-, and two-dimensional carbon frameworks, their structure can be oxidized, respectively, which is known as photochemical oxidation. Various carbons have their own distinctive morphology and electron transport properties, which are applicable for the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cell. We, here, report on the improvement of electrochemical performance of the lithium/sulfur cell through such an efficient functionalization approach.

Here, it is first presented that enriched edge sites derived from vertical standing and ultrathin 2D layered metal selenides (2DLMS) can simultaneously achieve the thermodynamic and kinetic regulation for polysulfides diffusion, which is systematically elucidated through theoretical calculation, electrochemical characterization, and spectroscopic/microscopic analysis. When employed to fabricate compact coating layer of separator, an ultrahigh capacity of 1338.7 mA h g(-1) is delivered after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, which is the best among the reports. Over 1000 cycles, the cell still maintains the capacity of 546.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C. Moreover, the cell exhibits outstanding capacities of 1106.2 and 865.7 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at stern temperature of 0 and -25 degrees C. The superior low-temperature performance is appealing for extended practical application of LSBs. Especially, in view of the economy, the 2DLMS is recycled as an anode of lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries after finishing the test of LSBs. The low-cost and scalable 2DLMS with enriched egde sites open a new avenue for the perfect regulation of the sulfur electrode.

Herein, the titanium-based nanorods/ketjen black (KB) composite prepared by a facile hydrothermal reaction is deposited on polypropylene to fabricate a bi-functional separator (KTO-2/PP) for Li/S cell. Using bare sublimed sulfur cathode, the cell based on KTO-2/PP separator exhibits excellent rate capability, delivering 1122, 856, and 566 mAh g(-1) at 0.2, 1 and 2C, respectively. Moreover, the reversible capacity of the KTO-2/PP based cell can reach 754 mAh g(-1) (1C) in the 200th cycle. Such performance boost is primarily ascribed to the KTO-2/PP separator, that Li+ is allowed to pass through but lithium polysulfides (LiPS) is shielded against shuttle. The conductive KB facilitates electron transport and adsorbs LiPS physically. The titanium-based nanorods adsorbs LiPS chemically by forming Ti-S bond which is confirmed by XPS analysis. Regarding the aged Li/S cell using KTO-2/PP, the smooth surface of PP (facing lithium anode) and the less sediment and negligible corrosion on anode indicate that the KTO-2/PP separator acts as an efficient barrier to inhibit the LiPS migration and enhances the electrochemical performance.

However, there are still several obstacles that restrict their commercial applications such as the insulating nature of sulfur, large volumetric expansion of sulfur cathodes and the shuttle effect of the soluble lithium polysulfide (Li2Sx, 4 <= x <= 8) intermediates, leading to the low sulfur utilization, fast capacity fading and low coulombic efficiency. Herein, we develop a simple, low-cost and high-yield method to synthesize mesoporous hollow carbon capsules (MHCCs) as sulfur cathode hosts for Li-S batteries. There are numerous worm-like mesopores with a size of 3.8 nm on the capsule's wall (about 10 nm in thickness). As the sulfur hosts, the 3.8 nm mesopores on the walls of MHCCs can dramatically prevent polysulfides inside or adsorbed on the surface of the MHCCs to effuse from cathode to anode. As a consequence, the sulfur cathodes that utilizing unique MHCCs as the sulfur hosts (MHCCs/S cathodes) can significantly improve the long-term cycle performance (72% capacity retention after 600 cycles) of Li-S batteries.

However, the sulfur loading and sulfur content are low in most of the reported Li-S batteries, resulting in a low practical energy density. Herein, binder- and metal-current-collector-free lightweight electrodes based on a free-standing three dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped graphene/TiN composite aerogel (3DNG-TiN) are designed and prepared to assemble high energy density Li-S batteries. The 3D network structure in the aerogel provides excellent charge transport channels and large microand submicron pores to ensure an ultrahigh sulfur loading. Notably, the polar TiN nanoparticle component in the composite effectively suppresses the shuttling effect and accelerates the reaction kinetics of polysulfides, which significantly enhances the cycling and rate performance of resulting Li-S batteries. Additionally, the lightweight free-standing 3DNG-TiN electrode (3.54 mg/cm(2)) boosts the absolute sulfur content in the cathode up to 85.0 wt %. Li-S batteries with a high sulfur loading (20.0 mg/cm(2)) exhibit high initial areal capacities of 18.9 mA h/cm(2) and 16.2 mA h/cm(2) after 100 cycles at 2.0 mA/cm(2). This work provides a new strategy to achieve a high energy density of Li-S batteries.

However, practical applications of Li-S batteries are severely restricted by not only intrinsic polysulfides shuttle resulting from their concentration gradient diffusion and sluggish conversion kinetics but also serious safety issue caused by thermolabile and combustible polymer separators. Herein, it is presented for the first time that a robust and multifunctional separator with urchin-like Co-doped FeOOH microspheres and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an interlayer simultaneously achieves to suppress polysulfides shuttle as well as improves thermotolerance and nonflammability of commercial PP separator. Accordingly, Li-S batteries with modified separator exhibit remarkable performance in a wide range temperatures of -25-100 degrees C. Typically, under 25 degrees C, ultrahigh initial capacities of 1441 and 827.29 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and 2 C are delivered, and remained capacities of 936 and 663.18 mA h g(-1) can be obtained after 500 cycles, respectively. At 0.1 C, the S utilization can reach up to 97%. Significantly, at 1 C, the batteries also deliver an excellent performance with remained capacities of high to 862.3, 608.4 and 420.6 mA h g(-1) after 100, 300 and 450 cycles under 75, 0 and -25 degrees C, respectively.

However, the serious polysulfide shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode poses a critical challenge for the development of Li-S batteries with elevated sulfur loadings. In addition, the poor robustness of traditional blade-casting cathodes greatly impedes the practical applications of flexible Li-S cells that display high areal capacity. To address these concerns, we report herein a freestanding hybrid sulfur host via in situ crafting of flexible carbon cloth (CC), vertically grown graphene nanoflakes over CC (G/CC) and metal-organic-framework derived CoP anchored on vertical graphene (CoP@G/CC). The thus-derived sulfur cathodes (CoP@G/CC-S) with a typical sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2) exhibit outstanding electrochemical performances, including excellent rate capability (930.1 mA h g(-1) at 3.0C) and impressive cycling stability (0.03% capacity decay per cycle after 500 cycles at 2.0C).

The molecular structure of the GFC film is primarily composed of aromatic components, and the film is doped by N (8.62%) and 0 (8.12%) elements. The conductivity of the final product reaches as high as 0.71 S cm(-1). The GFC film serves as the conductive interlayer to greatly improve the performance of Li-S batteries including capacity retention and rate capability. By inserting the GFC film, the battery can deliver a capacity of similar to 700 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 C. Even performed at 5 C, it is able to deliver a reversible capacity of more than 650 mAh g(-1). This research presents a facile and effective method for the fabrication of superior macroscopic carbon monolith, which holds great potential in other forms of electrochemical energy storage.

However, sulfur cathodes suffer from issues such as shuttle effects, uncontrollable deposition of lithium sulfides species, and volume expansion of sulfur, which result in rapid capacity fading and low Coulombic efficiency. In recent years, metal-oxide nanostructures have been widely used in Li-S batteries, owing to their effective inhibition of the shuttle effect and controlled deposition of lithium sulfide. However, the nonconductive metal-oxides used in Li-S batteries suffer from extra diffusion process, which slows down the electrochemical reaction kinetics. Herein, we report the synthesis of carbon nanoflakes decorated with conductive aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO@C) nanoparticles, through a facile biotemplating method using kapok fibers as both the template and carbon source. A sulfur cathode based on the AZO@C nanocomposites shows better electrochemical performance than those of cathodes based on ZnO and Al2O3 with poor conductivity, with a stable capacity of 927 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1C (1C = 1,675 mA.g(-1)) after 100 cycles. A reversible capacity of 544 mAh.g(-1) after 300 cycles was obtained even after increasing the current density to 0.5C, with a 0.039% capacity decay per cycle under a sulfur loading of 3.3 mg.cm(-2). Moreover, a capacity of 466 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5C could still be obtained when the sulfur loading was increased to 6.96 mg.cm(-2). The excellent electrochemical performance of the AZO@C/S composite can be attributed to its high conductivity of the polar AZO host, which suppresses the shuttle effect while simultaneously improving the redox kinetics in the reciprocal transformation of lithium sulfide species.

The RG@CoS@C-C-RG@CoS@C architecture enables fast electron and Li+ diffusion, strong adsorption of S/Li2Sx and high-efficiency conversion on two-sided RG@CoS surfaces. With detailed experimental and theoretical characterization, we reveal that although the conformal graphene coating largely shields the catalytic activity and adsorbing ability of CoS nanosheets, the exposed interfaces of CoS at the defective sites of the graphene coating exhibit especially strong lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) anchoring and high conversion efficiency, with high-flux Li+ and electron transfer from the circumjacent graphene coating and the buried carbon nanofibers. Furthermore, the exposed interfaces exhibit an effective decrease in Li2S decomposition by releasing Li+ onto the circumjacent graphene surface with a low Li+ diffusion barrier and anchoring the remaining Li-S bond on the exposed CoS interface with a high adsorption energy. The unique structure consisting of catalytic CoS nanosheets, defective RG coating, and interwoven C fiber interlayers enables not only the coupling of Li+ diffusion and electron transfer but also efficient regulation of the polysulfide reaction, thereby producing a synergistic catalyzing effect on both LiPS conversion and Li2S decomposition. As a result, the batteries with RG@CoS@C membranes as interlayers exhibit stable cycle performance and reversible capacities of 629.2 mA h g(-1) after 420 cycles at 2.0 C. The proposed strategy will contribute to guiding the design of novel composite materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The main disadvantage is the relatively low sulfur content in sulfurized carbon materials. Borrowing the idea from rubber crosslinking chemistry, here we report the use of a vulcanization accelerator in carbon sulfurization. Vulcanization accelerators significantly improve sulfur content by similar to 8 wt%, which results in a remarkable increase in the discharge capacity of corresponding Li-S batteries by similar to 120 mA h g(-1) while maintaining the outstanding cycling stability and low self-discharge. The effectiveness of this approach and the wide variety of vulcanization accelerator chemistry will pave the way for sulfurized carbon materials towards practical applications in Li-S batteries.

The self-assembled graphene aerogel with nano-MnO2 modified walls serves as the rigid sulfur container while the cross-linked PVP-PVA interpenetrating network acts as the flexible polysulfide trap. The synergic actions enable the hybrid host to present not only good electronic and ionic 3D transfer pathways, but also superior physical and chemical sulfur confinement. Consequently, the MGPP@S composite cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical energy storage performance. It shows initial discharge capacity of 1492, 1054, 833, 659 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, respectively; meantime it retains a capacity over 755 mAh g(-1) during 250 cycles at 0.2C and only has 0.06% capacity decay per cycle during 500 cycles at 1C. The major capacity decay on first several cycling is accounted for sulfurous consumption in saturating the electrolyte and building the interfacial layer; afterwards, the composite electrode can perform consistent capability upon extending cycling.

However, it still faces many challenges, the most important of which lies in the notorious polysulfide shuttle effect. Herein, we design and fabricate graphene-supported, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived NiSe2 nanoparticles (rGO-NiSe2) as separator modifiers. The NiSe2 nanoparticles with high catalytic activity can effectively adsorb polysulfides and accelerate their conversion. A highly conductive graphene as a catalyst substrate can effectively decrease the internal resistance of the battery. In addition, the intercalation growth of octahedral MOF-derived NiSe2 nanoparticles between graphene sheets provides abundant active sites for polysulfides. The battery with a rGO-NiSe2-modified separator provides an initial capacity of 1356.5 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, and only experiences a low capacity decay rate of 0.079% per cycle during 500 cycles of operation at 1 C. Even under a relatively high loading amount of 5.2 mg cm-2, the battery can still yield a high specific capacity of 774.3 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and a capacity retention of 84% after 100 cycles.

However, its practical application has been seriously hindered by the rapid capacity degradation associated with the "shuttle effect" and unstable electrodes. Such negative issues during charge-discharge process could be alleviated by modification of the separator, which is demonstrated in this paper. Here, we report a sandwich-type vanadium nitride/polyvinylidene fluoride-polymethylmethacrylate/hexagonal boron nitride separator (VN/PVDF-PMMA/hBN) by electrospinning of PVDF-PMMA nanofiber membrane, followed by magnetron sputtering of VN and hBN layer at the opposite size of the membrane. Compared to conventional coating method, magnetron sputtering led to an ultrathin coating layer of 200 nm. The sputtered VN/ PVDF-PMMA/hBN separator showed higher porosity (68.7%) than commercial polypropylene (PP) separator (44.5%), and significantly high electrolyte uptake (335.8% s. 175.9%), which can lead to rapid transportation of lithium ions. In the meantime, the membrane showed clear benefit in inhibiting polysulfide diffusion and lithium metal electrode stabilization due to the presence of polar C=O groups that interact with the polysulfides. As a result, the Li-S battery with VN/PVDF-PMMA/hBN separator showed a high initial discharge capacity of 1077.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, which only slightly decreased to 905.1 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. Significantly higher than the battery with commercial PP separator.

Currently, many efforts have been devoted to solving problems related to either shuttle effect on sulfur cathode or dendrite growth on lithium anode. However, dual side protection is rarely reported. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized yolk-shell nitrogen doped carbon frameworks embedded with heterostructures ZnSe-CoSe2 (ZnSe-CoSe2 @NC), working as "two-in-one " hosts for both the sulfur cathode and lithium anode protection. As an anode host, the in situ formed Li2Se phase contributes to the Li+ transfer. Co and Zn guides a homogenous growth of Li within the 3D framework, thus effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. Meanwhile, the heterostructure ZnSe-CoSe2 endows the cathode host with superior electronic conductivity, strong polysulfide chemisorption and efficient catalytic activity for polysulfide redox when compared with single metal selenides. Combined with these advantages, this Li-S full cell exhibits ultralong cycle life over 1000 cycles at 2 C. Even with a high sulfur loading (6.08 mg cm(-2)) and lean electrolyte (4.1 mu L mg(-1)), the full cell achieves a high areal capacity of 4.16 mA h cm(-2) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. This work not only provides a new approach for the structure design of Li-S full battery, but also improves the utilization of active electrode materials.

On one hand, the CNT film with high conductivity, microstructural rough surface, high flexibility and mechanical durability retains stable and direct electronic contact with the sulfur cathode materials, therefore decreasing internal resistivity and suppressing polarization of the cathode. On the other hand, the highly porous structure and the high surface area of the CNT film provide abundant adsorption points to support and confine sulfur cathode materials, alleviate their aggregation and promote high sulfur utilization. Moreover, the lightweight and compact structure of the CNT film adds no extra weight or volume to the sulfur cathode, benefitting the improvement of energy densities. Based on these characteristics, the sulfur cathode with a 100-layer cross-stacked CNT film presents excellent rate performances with capacities of 986, 922 and 874 mAh g(-1) at cycling rates of 0.2C, 0.5C and 1C for sulfur loading of 60 wt%, corresponding to an improvement of 52%, 109% and 146% compared to that without a CNT film. Promising cycling performances are also demonstrated, offering great potential for scaled-up production of sulfur cathodes for Li-S batteries.

However, the performance of LSBs is hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, heterostructual Nb2O5 nanocrystals/reduced graphene oxide (Nb2O5/RGO) composites are introduced into LSBs through separator modification for boosting the electrochemical performance. The Nb2O5/RGO heterostructures are designed as chemical trappers and conversion accelerators of LiPSs. Originating from the strong chemical interactions between Nb2O5 and LiPSs as well as the superior catalytic nature of Nb2O5, the Nb2O5/RGO nanocomposite possesses high trapping efficiency and efficient electrocatalytic activity to long-chain LiPSs. The effective regulation of LiPSs conversion enables the LSBs enhanced redox kinetics and suppressed shuttle effect. Moreover, the Nb2O5/RGO nanocomposite has abundant sulfophilic sites and defective interfaces, which are beneficial for the nucleation and growth of Li2S, as evidenced by analysis of the cycled separators. As a result, LSBs with the Nb2O5/RGO-modified separators exhibit excellent rate capability (816 mAh g(-1) at 3 A g(-1)) and cyclic performance (628 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles). Remarkably, high specific capacity and stable cycling performance are demonstrated even at an elevated temperature of 50 degrees C or with higher sulfur loadings.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur and large volume change still inhibit all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries from achieving favorable electrochemical performances. In this work, linear-chain compound vanadium tetrasulfide (VS4) anchored reduced graphene oxide (rGO-VS4) nanocomposites are successfully synthesized via a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. Furthermore, 10%rGO-VS4@Li7P3S11 nanocomposites with multi-channel continuous electronic/ionic conductive network are prepared by a facile liquid-phase deposition reaction and further employed as an alternative material for sulfur cathode in all-solid-state lithium batteries. Typically, Li/75%Li2S-24%P2S5-1%P2O5/Li10GeP2S12/10% rGO-VS4@Li7P3S11 all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries deliver high reversible capacity of 611 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) after 100 cycles, corresponding to 853 mAh g(-1) based on the mass of sulfur. Even after being cycled at 0.5 A g(-1) between 1.5 and 3.0 V for 500 cycles, it still shows the discharge specific capacity of 333 mAh g(-1) based on sulfur content with excellent cycling stability. The excellent rate capability and cycle performances can be ascribed to the multi-channel continuous electronic/ionic conductive networks and the improved structural stability. In addition, the electrochemical reaction kinetics and capacity contributions as well as reaction mechanisms of 10%rGO-VS4@Li7P3S11 in all-solid-state lithium batteries were revealed by ex-situ characterization techniques.

On the other hand, there are still challenging issues for the practical applications of Li-S batteries, including low sulfur utilization, poor cyclability, and rate capability. Although considerable efforts are made to overcome the current obstacles in Li-S batteries, one is still far from meeting the requirements for the commercialization of Li-S batteries. This review outlines the recent progress in Li-S batteries based on novel configurations, such as incorporating functional interlayers/separators beyond the approach for preparing novel cathodes, and discusses the role of the configuration in Li-S batteries.

In such a battery, 3D electrode of sulfur embedded into porous graphene sponges (S-GS) was directly used as the cathode with large areal mass loading of sulfur (12 mg cm(-2)), approximately 6-12 times larger than that of most reports. The graphene sponges (GS) worked as a framework that can provide high electronic conductive network, abilities to absorb the polysulfides intermediate, and meanwhile mechanical support to accommodate the volume changes during charge and discharge. As a result, the S-GS electrode with 80 wt.% sulfur can deliver an extremely high areal specific capacitance of 6.0 mAh cm(-2) of the 11th cycle, and maintain 4.2 mAh cm(-2) after 300 charge-discharge cycles at a rate of 0.1C, representing an extremely low decay rate (0.08% per cycle after 300 cycles), which could be the highest areal specific capacity with comparable cycle stability among the rechargeable Li/S batteries reported ever.

We probe the role played by the lone pairs of the dopants in confining the lithium polysulfides (LiPS) to understand the mechanism of binding. Our results show that the Li bond between the polysulfides and the doped GNRs is analogous to a hydrogen bond and also dipole-dipole interactions play a key role in anchoring the polysulfides. A critical donor-Li-acceptor angle of 180 degrees is found to be essential for proper adsorption of LiPS, highlighting the importance of the directionality of lone pairs. The charge lost by the sulfur atom of the polysulfide upon adsorption and shape of the lone pair basins and the value of Electron Localization Function (ELF) at the dopant position can provide a quick estimate of the strength of the bond. Significant contractions in the ELF profiles are also observed upon Li2S adsorption, further providing evidence for the hydrogen bond-like nature of the Li bond. Our results corroborate the fact that all acceptors capable of forming hydrogen bonds can be employed as suitable dopants for carbon-based cathode hosts in Li-S batteries.

Unfortunately, lithium-sulfur batteries suffer from several limitations that still produce a relatively fast capacity fading and poor utilization of active materials. In order to alleviate the disadvantages that arise at the cathode, several researchers have searched for new electrode materials. Because of the long standing tradition in the use of carbons in energy storage systems, carbonaceous cathodes have been the most popular choice. Recently, however, there has been a trend for the study of non-carbonaceous materials as cathodes in lithium-sulfur systems. Materials such as polymers, metal oxides, metal carbides, amongst many others were reported, showing excellent properties which make them compete side by side with state of the art carbonaceous cathodes. These materials have generally improved the conductivity of the conventional sulfur electrode, and have provided a 3D soft adsorbent porous structure, which efficiently traps polysulfides. These characteristics are reflected in an improved electrochemical performance, reaching, in some cases, capacity retention values close to 1000 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at high discharge rate. Here, we propose a review of these non-carbonaceous cathodes. (C) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

The hollow core-shell interlinked carbon spheres were obtained through solution synthesis of polymer spheres followed by a pyrolysis process that occurred in the hermetical silica shell. During the pyrolysis, the polymer sphere was transformed into the carbon core and the carbonaceous volatiles were self-deposited on the silica shell due to the blocking effect of the hermetical silica shell. The gravitational force and the natural driving force of lowering the surface energy tend to interlink the carbon core and carbon/silica shell, resulting in a core-shell interlinked structure. After the SiO2 shell was etched, the mesoporous carbon shell was generated. When used as the sulfur host for Li-S batteries, such a hierarchical structure provides access to Li+ ingress/egress for reactivity with the sulfur and, meanwhile, can overcome the limitations of low sulfur loading and a severe shuttle effect in solid carbon-supported sulfur cathodes. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy images provide visible evidence that sulfur is well-encapsulated in the hollow void. Importantly, such anchored-core carbon nanostructures can simultaneously serve as a physical buffer and an electronically connecting matrix, which helps to realize the full potential of the active materials. Based on the many merits, carbon-sulfur cathodes show a high utilization of sulfur with a sulfur loading of 70 wt % and exhibit excellent cycling stability (i.e., 960 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C).

Nevertheless, the 'shuttle effect' of soluble polysulfide (a discharge product) reduces their cycling stability and capacity, thus restricting their practical application. To tackle this challenging issue, we herein report a sulfonated covalent organic framework modified separator (SCOF-Celgard) that alleviates the shuttling of polysulfide anions and accelerates the migration of Li+ ions. Specifically, the negatively charged sulfonate can inhibit the same charged polysulfide anion through electrostatic repulsion, thereby improving the cycle stability of the battery and preventing the Li-anode from being corroded. Meanwhile, the sulfonate groups may facilitate the positively charged lithium ions to pass through the separator. Consequently, the battery assembled with the SCOF-Celgard separator exhibits an 81.1% capacity retention after 120 cycles at 0.5 C, which is far superior to that (55.7%) of the battery with a Celgard separator. It has a low capacity degradation of 0.067% per cycle after 600 cycles at 1 C, and a high discharge capacity (576 mAh g(-1)) even at 2 C. Our work proves that the modification of a separator with a SCOF is a viable and effective route for enhancing the electrochemical performance of a LSB.

However, its practical application is hindered by poor conductivity of sulfur and the shuttle effect. Herein, a hierarchical three-dimensional nitrogen and phosphorous codoped graphene and carbon nanotubes with 70 wt% of sulfur content (N, P codoped G/CNTs-S70) composite was prepared using melamine phosphate as a single precursor of N and P. The simultaneous introduction of N and P creates high active sites on the G/CNTs backbones, restricts the detachments of sulfur from the host G/CNTs, and induces strong chemical adsorption of the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. The as-prepared N, P codoped G/CNTs-S70 composite delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1550 mA h g(-1) and retains a capacity of 735 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. This is a significant improvement in the rate capability and cycling stability compared with the un-doped G/CNTs-S70 cathode. This simple strategy with single precursor offers promising electrochemical properties for Li-S batteries.

However, in the lithium-sulfur battery, the commercial separator shows feeble ability for promoting the conversion of accumulated long-chain polysulfides to the short-chain polysulfides on the surface of the cathode. In this work, a carbon-intercalated montmorillonite is designed to release the imprisoned capacity of the sulfur cathode by activating the accumulated long-chain polysulfides on the surface of the cathode. Benefiting from the advantages of carbon-intercalated montmorillonite, the lithium-sulfur battery achieves a high discharge capacity of 818 mAh g(-1) over 300 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) with a sulfur loading of 2.6 mg cm(-2). The systematic analyses by cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance reveal that the regulation of redox environment on the cathode surface by reducing the accumulated long-chain polysulfides to short-chain sulfides is a scalable solution for constructing the actual lithium-sulfur batteries.

But the poor conductivity of sulfur and particularly the migration of soluble polysulfides greatly hindered the application of Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a novel strategy for trapping polysulfides by coating a separator with an interwoven framework of MoO3 nanorods and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the interlayer in Li-S batteries. The interwoven scaffold-like MoO3@CNT network provides abundant conducting channels and pathways for ions and electrons, leading to high rate capabilities. While the MoO3@CNT interlayer acting as a barrier effectively mitigates the shuttle effect in Li-S batteries, the MoO3 nanorods enfolded by CNTs uniformly play an important role in immobilizing sulfur species. Consequently, the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries are improved, giving rise to higher capacities with a longer cycling life. The Li-S batteries with the MoO3@CNT interlayer can deliver a specific capacity of 755 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.3C, and show an excellent rate capability with a capacity of 655 mA h g(-1) at 3C.

However, the serious polysulfides shuttle and slow redox reaction kinetics hinder their large-scale commercial applications. Various attempts have been made to solve the problems. Herein, a CoSe@NC nanofiber membrane was prepared by electrospinning method and used as independent functional interlayer for the Li-S batteries. The visualized adsorption experiments show that the CoSe@NC nanofiber exhibits strong adsorption capability for polysulfides; In addition, CoSe nanoparticles with strong catalytic activity can accelerate the conversion of polysulfides. The adsorption-catalysis synergy of CoSe@NC can therefore effectively enhance the rate performance and cycling stability of Li-S batteries. The cell assembled with CoSe@NC functional interlayer delivers a high initial reversible discharge capacity of 1317 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C rate. After 200 cycles at 1.0 C, the capacity decay rate is only 0.16% per cycle.

Metal anions WO42- and MoO42- are grafted on plant polyphenol-modified CFs and then in situ converted into WN/Mo2C implanted in a matrix of CNFs (WMCNFs). The obtained WN/Mo2C is of quantum size and uniform distribution, exposing the active sites maximally. Further, the heterostructure of the bimetallic composite enables unique electronic interaction, thereby synergistically enhancing its adsorption capability toward soluble intermediates and activating its catalytic function for liquid-liquid and liquid-solid conversions. Combining these merits, when used as a separator modification material and a sulfur host simultaneously, the WMCNFs composite exhibits remarkable cycling stability with 91.45% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 2 C and also prominent rate performance of delivering 552.75 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of 10 C. Meanwhile, the stable luminescence operation of LED lights powered by the assembled pouch cell demonstrates the application potential of this biomaterial-derived composite.

Prussian blue analogues (PBs) have demonstrated their efficiency in hindering the shuttle effects as host materials of sulfur; unfortunately, they show an inferior electronic conductivity, exhibiting considerable lifespan but poor rate performance. Herein, we rationally designed a PB@reduced graphene oxide as the host material for sulfur (S@PB@rGO) hybridsviaa facile liquid diffusion and physical absorption method, in which the sulfur was integrated into Na2Co[Fe(CN)(6)] and rGO framework. When employed as a cathode, the as-prepared hybrid exhibited excellent rate ability (719 mA h g(-1)at 1C) and cycle stability (918 mA h g(-1)at 0.5C after 100 cycles). The improved electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergetic effect of PB and conductive rGO, which not only enhanced the physisorption of polysulfides but also provided a conductive skeleton to ensure rapid charge transfer kinetics, achieving high energy/power outputs and considerable lifespan simultaneously. This study may offer a new method manufacturing high performance Li-S batteries.

Here, an efficient strategy to produce nitrogen-enriched hierarchical porous carbon (N-HPC) is reported by facile pyrolysis of magnesium citrate and subsequent NH3 treatment. As-prepared N-HPC presents a developed hierarchical micro-and trimodal meso-porosity with a high specific surface area of 1290 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 3.04 cm(3) g(-1). It also shows an abundant nitrogen doping of 3.6%. When used for electrochemical electrodes in supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, significantly enhanced performances have been obtained compared with commercially available activated carbon. In supercapacitor testing, the N-HPC electrode shows a specific capacitance of 101 F g(-1) in a nonaqueous electrolyte. And the capacitance retains 67% even at a 200-fold charge/discharge rate. Moreover, its performance in Li-S batteries is more outstanding. It enables a very high sulfur loading (76.2% by weight) and the resulting N-HPC/S cathode shows high discharge capacities of 1153 mA h g(sulfur)(-1) (or 702 mA h g(electrode)(-1)) at 0.2C and 671 mA h g(-1) even at 4C.

But it was impeded by poor electronic conductivity, serious shuttle effect, and enormous volume expansion. Herein, hierarchical porous carbons were simply prepared by a modified nanoCaCO(3) hard-template method from glucose. The template-removal step was modified from HCl washing to HCl soaking. This allowed the microstructure of carbon product significantly involved. Furthermore, the mass ratio of CaCO3 nanoparticles and glucose played an important role in booming of hierarchical porous and specific surface area. When integrated with S, functioned as cathode in Li-S battery, improved electrochemical performances were exhibited, such as high initial discharge capacity and good capacity retention. This modified hard-template method suggested a promising way to fabricate hierarchical porous carbon matrix available to apply in advanced Li-S battery.

Increasing conductivity and introducing polarity into the sulfur host can effectively overcome these long-standing problems. Herein, we first prepared Co3W3C@ C@CNTs/S material and used it in the cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries. Carbon nanotubes treated with acidification have good dispersibility in aqueous solution, good adsorption on positively charged metal ions due to abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface. After carbonization treatment, Co3W3C will be firmly anchored on the surface of carbon nanotubes, which is conducive to improving the electrical conductivity and stability of its own materials. Polar Co3W3C can form a strong interaction with polysulfide intermediates, effectively inhibiting its shuttle effect, improving the utilization of sulfur cathode electrodes, and keeping the capacity and cycle stability. The Co3W3C@C@CNTs/S electrode material has a capacity of 1093 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and 482 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1). Even after 500 cycles of 2 A g(-1), the capacity of each cycle is only reduced by 0.08%.

However, the commercialization remains constrained by the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics of polysulfides. Herein, a spraying/discharging strategy is employed to fabricate binder-free omega-Li3V2O5 (omega-LVO) catalytic network with multi-polarization centers by intercalating Li-ions into tetrahedral V2O5 for addressing the mentioned issues. Li (0.51 eV) and V (0.57 eV), which have a strong positive electric potential, and O (-0.57 eV), which has a strong negative electric potential, exhibit high polarity that can capture polysulfides effectively. In addition, the amounts of the polarity sites would be significantly increased because the catalyst is composed of light elements. Therefore, the omega-LVO octahedron can catalyze polysulfides to short-chains sufficiently. The blue shift in synchronous ultraviolet-visible spectra and ultra-low Tafel plots of 34 and 20 mV dec(-1) at two discharge plateaus demonstrate excellent kinetics behavior even with a low catalyst loading. Furthermore, the conductive networks facilitate electronic/ionic transmission and thereby boost their electrochemical performances. This work offers an efficacious method to promote kinetics behaviors and lessen the gap between theoretical specific capacities and future commercialization of LSBs.

However, the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries is limited by low utilization of active materials and excessive capacity decay which caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfide in the practical applications. In this article, effective polysulfide adsorption method was applied via using modified PP separator coated super P and Al2O3 on the two sides, respectively. As a result, this strategy solves the problems of polysulfide shuttle effect and poor sulfur conduction at the same time. The initial discharge specific capacity of lithium-sulfur batteries, which assembled with the super P + PP + Al2O3 separator, could reach 1247 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 C. After 60 discharge / charge cycles, the discharge capacity was still 987 mAh g(-1), with a capacity retention of 79%. This method of simultaneous modification on both sides of the separator provides a new idea for the modification of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the commercial application of Li-S batteries is limited because of the severe polysulfide shuttle effect, the insulating nature of sulfur, and fast capacity decay. To address these obstacles, we report for the first time a facile synthesis of an amorphous cobalt boride (Co2B)@graphene material as a novel sulfur host, which provides high specific capacity and cycling performance. Endowed by the unique synergistic effect of Co and B interaction with polysulfides and the high electrical conductivity of graphene, the cobalt boride (Co2B)@graphene composite shows a specific capacity of 1487 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and delivers an outstanding cycling performance with a capacity of 758 mA h g(-1) for the 450(th) cycle at 1C, representing a 0.029% fading rate per cycle.

However, the rapid capacity fading due to the shuttling effect of long-chain lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) between electrodes and sluggish redox kinetics remain a big hindrance in practical applications. Herein, three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (GA) with uniformly distributed and defect-rich 1T/2H-MoS2 nanosheets has been developed by adding melamine foam (MF) as the hard template. The resultant MF-GA-MoS2 composites have strong electron transfer capabilities and rich catalytic activity sites that can adsorb and catalyze the conversion of LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S, thus reducing the shuttle effect to improve the performance of Li-S batteries. Li-S batteries with the defect-rich MF-GA-MoS2composites modified separator exhibit amazing initial discharge capacity of 1323 mAh g(-1) at 0.2, high ratio capacity of 718 mAh g(-1) at 1C after 400 cycles, and low decay rate of 0.0485% per lap after 800 cycles at 3C. This work provides a novel strategy for the development of separator modified materials with high adsorption and catalytic properties in Li-S batteries.

The composites contain 80 wt.% sulfur and 20 wt.% of either MnO2 or TiO2, leading to a sulfur content in the electrode of 64 wt.% and revealing a reversible, fast, and lowly polarized conversion process in the cell with limited interphase resistance. The S-TiO2 composite exhibits an excellent rate capability between C/10 and 2C, and a cycle life extended over 400 cycles at 2C, owing to the effects of the nanometric TiO2 additive in boosting the reaction kinetics. Instead, the micrometric sized particles of MnO2 partially limit the electrochemical activity of S-MnO2 to the current rate of 1C. Nevertheless, both S-MnO2 and S-TiO2 withstand a sulfur loading up to values approaching 6 mg cm(-2), and deliver an areal capacity ranging from about 4.5 to 5.5 mAh cm(-2) at C/5. The excellent performances of the metal oxide-sulfur electrodes, even at high active material loading, and the possible scalability of the synthetic pathway adopted in the work suggest that the composites are viable cathodes for next-generation Li-S batteries with high energy density and efficient electrochemical process.

Regarding these issues, herein, a sponge-like Ketjen black (KB)-triphenylphosphine sulfide (TPS) multifunctional modification layer was proposed to coat the separator of the advanced Li-S batteries. The layer was formed by an in situ spontaneous reaction between triphenylphosphine (TPP) of the conventional KB-TPP layer and Li2S6 solution. This functional layer can ensure a high e(-) and Li+ conductivity while inhibiting the diffusion of soluble polysulfides. As a result, the redox activity, rate capability, and cycling stability of the batteries are significantly enhanced. Comparing with the discharge capacities at 2C for the PE separator, introducing the KB-TPS functional layer was beneficial for the capacity retentions of the cells, since the capacity increased from 16.1% to 66.6% at the same C-rate. A capacity degeneration rate of 0.045% per cycle was obtained for the cell with an S area density of 3.6 mg cm(-2). This work is a step forward in the exploration of advanced Li-S batteries, being a valuable reference for the study of related systems.

New insights into both the internal chemical reactions in a lithium-sulfur system and effective routes to retard self-discharge for highly stable batteries are crucial for the design of lithium-sulfur cells. Herein, a lithium-sulfur cell with a carbon nanotube/sulfur cathode and lithium-metal anode in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide/1,3-dioxolane/dimethyl ether electrolyte was selected as the model system to investigate the self-discharge behavior. Both lithium anode passivation and polysulfide anion diffusion suppression strategies are applied to reduce self-discharge of the lithium-sulfur cell. When the lithium-metal anode is protected by a high density passivation layer induced by LiNO3, a very low shuttle constant of 0.017 h(-1) is achieved. The diffusion of the polysulfides is retarded by an ion-selective separator, and the shuttle constants decreased. The cell with LiNO3 additive maintained a discharge capacity of 97% (961 mAhg(-1)) of the initial capacity after 120 days at open circuit, which was around three times higher than the routine cell (32% of initial capacity, corresponding to 320 mAhg(-1)). It is expected that lithium-sulfur batteries with ultralow self-discharge rates may be fabricated through a combination of anode passivation and polysulfide shuttle control, as well as optimization of the lithium-sulfur cell configuration.

Herein, novel Co0.85Se nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet arrays (Co0.85Se/NC) were constructed on carbon cloth as the self-supported host for a sulfur cathode using a facile fabrication strategy. The interconnected porous carbonbased structure of the Co0.85Se/NC could facilitate the rapid electron and ion transfer kinetics. The embedded Co0.85Se nanoparticles can effectively capture and catalyze lithium polysulfides, thus accelerating the redox kinetics and stabilizing sulfur cathodes. Therefore, the Co0.85Se/NC-S cathode could maintain a stable cycle performance for 400 cycles at 1C and deliver a high discharge specific capacity of 1361, 1001, and 810 mAh g(-1) at current densities of 0.1, 1, and 3C, respectively. This work provides an efficient design strategy for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries with high energy densities.

However, several barriers, including polysulfide shuttle effect, the slow solid-solid surface reaction pathway in the lower discharge plateau, and corrosion of Li anode still limit its practical applications, especially under the lean electrolyte condition required for high energy density. Here, we propose a solution-mediated sulfur reduction pathway to improve the capacity and reversibility of the sulfur cathode. With this method, a high coulombic efficiency (99%) and stable cycle life over 100 cycles were achieved under application-relevant conditions (S loading: 6.2 mg cm(-2); electrolyte to sulfur ratio: 3 mL(E) g(s)(-1); sulfur weight ratio: 72 wt%). This result is enabled by a specially designed Li2S4-rich electrolyte, in which Li2S is formed through a chemical disproportionation reaction instead of electrochemical routes. A single diglyme solvent was used to obtain electrolytes with the optimum range of Li2S4 concentration. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the solution pathway in a practical Li-S cell. This solution pathway not only introduces a new electrolyte regime for practical Li-S batteries, but also provides a new perspective for bypassing the inefficient surface pathway for other electrochemical processes.

The modified separator provides effective trapping of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), catalyzed sulfur redox, as well as suppressed formation of Li dendrites in one configuration. The highly catalytic and dual sulfiphilic/lithiophilic FeTaPc exhibits a tight adsorption geometry with LiPSs, which enables promoted electron exchange between the adsorbed LiPSs and the current collecting rGO. Dendrite suppression on the Li anode is enabled by the high Li-ion transference number resulted from the interactions of FeTaPc@rGO with Li-ion and its counterions. The hindering of LiPSs migrations by FeTaPc@rGO also alleviates the surface corrosion of the Li anode. The synergistic effect of the modified separator results in elevated sulfur redox kinetics, improved sulfur utilizations and stable charge/discharge cycling with areal sulfur loadings up to 5 mg cm(-2) on carbon-based cathodes with high sulfur contents. This study extends the effects of modified separators to the Li anodes, opening up new opportunities for future developments of Li-S batteries.

Plastic waste residue-derived boron and nitrogen co-doped porous hybrid carbon for a modified separator of a lithium sulfur battery	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Pyrolytic plastic waste residue; Top-down process; Multi-hetero-atom doping site; Modified separator; Lithium sulfur battery	PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDES; PYROLYSIS; DIOXIDE; CONVERSION; NANOTUBES; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM; NANOWIRE; PROGRESS	The continuous consumption of plastic has caused plastic waste accumulation and negative impacts on the environment. In response to this issue, plastic waste recycling through a pyrolysis process to produce liquid oils has been proposed. However, the pyrolysis process involves discarded or incinerated residue and effective utilization of the pyrolytic residue is required accordingly. This work introduces a hybrid carbon material that has not only high porosity but also polar sites, such as metal oxides and multi-heteroatom (boron and nitrogen) doping sites. This material was synthesized from pyrolytic residue through a top-down process, unlike the conventional bottom-up synthesis process employed for hybrid carbon. The resultant material is used as a functional layer of a modified separator, and it can effectively suppress the shuttle effect with excellent lithium polysulfide trapping ability and positively contribute to redox reaction kinetics of lithium sulfur batteries. As a result, a resultant cell with the pyrolytic residue derived modified separator exhibited outstanding cyclic stability and electrochemical performance: the capacity decay per cycle was only 0.057% even after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 C. This work will provide a useful reference to suggest a promising approach for effective utilization of the pyrolytic plastic waste residue. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The S/MC composites with 50, 60, and 72 wt.% sulfur loading are prepared by a facile heat treatment method. Electrochemical performance of the as-prepared S/MC composites are measured by galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), with carbonate-based electrolyte of 1.0 M LiPF6/(PC-EC-DEC). The composite with 50 wt.% sulfur presents the optimized electrochemical performance, including the utilization of active sulfur, discharge capacity, and cycling stability. At the current density of 50 mA g(-1), it can demonstrate a high initial discharge capacity of 1624.5 mAh g(-1). Even at the current density of 800 mA g(-1), the initial capacity of 1288.6 mAh g(-1) can be obtained, and the capacity can still maintain at 522.8 mAh g(-1) after 180 cycles. The remarkably improved electrochemical performance of the S/MC composite with 50 wt.% sulfur are attributed to the carbon matrix with microporous structure, which can effectively enhance the electrical conductivity of the sulfur cathode, suppress the loss of active material during charge/discharge processes, and restrain the migration of polysulfide ions to the lithium anode.

Hydrothermal carbon-based nanostructured hollow spheres as electrode materials for high-power lithium-sulfur batteries	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							COMPOSITE CATHODE MATERIALS; ELECTRICAL ENERGY-STORAGE; ION BATTERIES; RATE CAPABILITY; NANOSPHERES; CHALLENGES; CARBONIZATION; LIMN2O4	Carbon hollow spheres were produced using a sustainable approach, i.e. hydrothermal carbonization, using monosaccharides as carbon precursors and silica nanoparticles as hard-templates. Hydrothermal carbonization is an eco-efficient and cost-effective route to synthesize nanostructured carbonaceous materials from abundant biomass-derived molecules. After further thermal treatment under an inert atmosphere and removal of the silica-based core by chemical etching, porous hollow spheres depicting 5-8 nm thin shells were obtained. Subsequently, carbon-sulfur composites were synthesized via a melt diffusion method and used as nanostructured composites for cathodes in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells. The morphology of the hollow spheres was controlled and optimized to achieve improved electrochemical properties. Both high specific energies and high specific powers were obtained, due to the unique nanostructure of the hollow spheres. These results revealed that using optimized carbonaceous materials, it is possible to design sustainable Li-S cells showing promising electrochemical properties.

The enhancement of conductivity and introduction of polarity to the sulfur host is an effective strategy to overcome these long-standing challenges. In this work, a facile one-step carbonizing process is used to synthesize a unique porous and conducive nanocomposite where Fe3C nanoparticles are embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon sheets (Fe3C@NPCS). As demonstrated in Li2S4 adsorption experiments and confirmed by density functional theory calculations, Fe3C nanoparticles are able to strongly adsorb polysulfides via strong Fe-S chemical bonds. Due to the remarkable conductivity, Fe3C nanoparticles can also accelerate the electrochemical reactions of the polysulfides through fast electron transportation. The carbon sheets prevent the aggregation of Fe3C nanoparticles and accommodate sulfur and its volume expansion during charge/discharge processes. With these features, the resultant sulfur cathodes (Fe3C@NPCS-S) deliver an excellent cycling performance with a capacity decay of 0.036% per cycle, and high rate performance of ca. 1127, 1020, 907, 802, 731 and 647 mAh g(-1) under current densities of 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 C, respectively.

However, the associated low yield and high cost of such delicately constructed carbon materials have been the major bottleneck for their practical utilization. Herein, we present a hundred-gram fabrication of a graphitic carbon nitride@hierarchical porous carbon (g-C3N4@HPC) composite, which is derived from low-cost biomass and used as the sulfur host for Li-S batteries. On this material, interconnected and hierarchical porosity of HPC physically traps the polysulfides and buffers the volume variation, and in the meantime, the uniformly dispersed g-C3N4 nanoparticles and N dopants on it provide strong chemical affinity to further immobilize the polysulfides. Therefore, the g-C3N4@HPC/S cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1150.1 mAh g(-1) and excellent cycling stability with a very small capacity decay of 0.024% cycle(-1) for 250 cycles, at a high sulfur loading of 64.5 wt%. Importantly, this g-C3N4@HPC composite is derived from very cheap and eco-friendly precursors, enabling the hundred-gram production at bench-top scale, which shows significant viability for practical Li-S battery application.

Sparingly Solvating Electrolytes for High Energy Density Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							IONIC LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; LI-S; SUPERCONCENTRATED ELECTROLYTES; POROUS-ELECTRODES; ANION RECEPTORS; DESIGN; CARBON; LI-O-2; PERFORMANCE; REVERSIBILITY	Moving to lighter and less expensive battery chemistries compared to contemporary lithium-ion requires the control of energy storage mechanisms based on chemical transformations rather than intercalation. Lithium sulfur (Li/S) has tremendous theoretical specific energy, but contemporary approaches to control this solution-mediated, precipitation dissolution chemistry require large excesses of electrolyte to fully solubilize the polysulfide intermediates. Achieving reversible electrochemistry under lean electrolyte operation is the most promising path for Li/S to move beyond niche applications to potentially transformational performance. An emerging Li/S research area is the use of sparingly solvating electrolytes and the creation of design rules for discovering new electrolyte systems that fundamentally decouple electrolyte volume from sulfur and polysulfide reaction mechanism. This Perspective presents an outlook for sparingly solvating electrolytes as a key path forward for long-lived, high energy density Li/S batteries including an overview of this promising new concept and some strategies for accomplishing it.

In this process, the formation of a unified poly acrylonitrile /graphene oxide conductive network is accompanied by the uniform loading of sulfur, with a fraction of 52%. The as-prepared S/PAN/GO hybrid delivers an initial capacity of 1424 mAhg(-1) at 0.1C. The electrochemical performance of the composite is ascribed to the conductive network designed by interconnected GO and PAN, which supply an unimpeded and uninterrupted path for electron and Li-ion transfer and accommodate the volume variation of sulfur during charge/discharge cycling. Furthermore, the residual functional groups on S/PAN/GO composite can support close contact of the conducting matrix with sulfur and efficiently confine the diffusion of polysulfides. This study gives a green and highly active technique for carbon-sulfur electrode construction for lithium-sulfur batteries. The electrochemical execution improvement can be attributed to the multiple effects of the PAN and GO additive such as conductivity, sulfur distribution, and an active absorber for the reaction products.

However, the undesired shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 2 < n <= 8) and the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites have hindered their practical applications. Herein, a self-assembled freestanding MoO3/carbon nanofiber (MoO3/CNF) composite membrane is effectively integrated into Li-S batteries as a functional interlayer. Improved cell performance is achieved due to the strong interfacial chemical and physical interactions between the interlayers with Li2Sn. The Li-S batteries exhibit a decent cyclic stability with a fading rate of 0.12% per cycle for 500 cycles at 1675 mA g(-1), a high rate performance and a low self-discharge rate. In this rational design, the CNF network provides abundant electron pathways and physically prevents polysulfide diffusion. The polar MoO3 nanorods act as effective anchoring sites by the chemical interactions with Li2Sn. Meanwhile, the suppressed Li-dendrite growth on the Li-anode surface results in a stable Li stripping/plating.

The dual-layered cathode is composed of a sulfur active layer and a polysulfide absorption layer, and both layers are based on vitamin C treated graphene oxide at various degrees of reduction. By controlling the degree of reduction of graphene, the dual-layered cathode can increase sulfur utilization dramatically owing to the uniform formation of nanosized sulfur particles, the chemical bonding of dissolved polysulfides on the oxygen-rich sulfur active layer, and the physisorption of free polysulfides on the absorption layer. This approach enables a LSB with a high specific capacity of over 600 mAhg(sulfur)(-1) after 100 cycles even under a high current rate of 1C (1675 mAg(sulfur)(-1)). An intriguing aspect of our work is the synthesis of a high-performance dual-layered cathode by a green chemistry method, which could be a promising approach to LSBs with high energy and power densities.

However, the capacity attenuation caused by "shuttle effect" hinders their practical application. In this work, layered rotten egg albumen carbon (REAC) was fabricated via freezing dry and carbonization methods to enhance capacity retention of LSBs. The LSBs with REAC modified polypropylene (REAC PP) separator exhibit the following superior electronical performances: (1) the conductive REAC improves lithium ion (Li+) coefficient by increasing the electrical conductivity; (2) the nitrogen-doped sites in REAC enhances polysulfide adsorption and increases the electronic conductivity; (3) the compact layered structure inhibits the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides and enhance electrochemical performance. The LSBs with REAC PP separator and 72 wt% sulfur deliver an initial capacity of 1092.8 mA h g-1 at 0.1C. Also, such LSBs exhibit capacity of 633.8 mA h g-1 at 1C with low decay rate of 0.055% per cycle in 400 cycles. Considering the waste recycling, simple synthesis and enhanced electrochemical performance, REAC PP separator is promising for LSBs.

The structure characteristic and composition analysis of samples are conducted with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), elemental analysis (EA), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The electrochemical performances are characterized by galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The results show that the nitrogen-doped activated microporous carbon spheres (NAMCS) present uniform spherical morphology, abundant nitrogen content of 9.64 wt%, and large specific surface areas of 1578.6 m(2)/g. Compared with the activated microporous carbon sphere/sulfur (AMCS/S) composite, the NAMCS/S composite with same sulfur loading of 64 wt% can deliver a higher initial capacity of 1004.6 mAh/g and a stable capacity retention of 79.1% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C rate as well as a remarkable Coulombic efficiency of 93% and relative low capacity decay of 0.2% per cycle. These effective improvements are attributed to the change of surface physicochemical property, chemical interaction between nitrogen functionality and polysulfides and the physical adsorption of abundant microporous structure.

The natural nori powder was calcined at 900 degrees C for 3 h under Ar, in which NaCl non-aqueous ionic liquid can exfoliate carbon aggregates into nanosheets. The structural characterization of GNSCS by a series of techniques demonstrates the graphene-like feature. When evaluated as the matrix for sulfur cathode, GNSCS/S exhibits more prominent cycling stability and rate capability. A discharge capacity of 548 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 1.6 A g(-1) after 400 cycles was delivered with a capacity fade rate of only 0.13% per cycle and an initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) as high as 99.7%. When increasing the areal sulfur loading up to 3 mg cm(-2), the discharge capacity can still be retained at 647 mA h g(-1) after more than 100 cycles with a low capacity degradation of only similar to 0.30% per cycle. The features of N/S dual-doping and the graphene-like structure are propitious to the electron transportation, lithium-ion diffusion and more active sites for chemically adsorbing polysulfides. It is anticipated that other functional biochar carbon can also be attained via the low-cost, sustainable and green method.

To ensure the high utilization and electrochemical capacity of sulfur in all-solid-state batteries, both the electronic and ionic conductivities of the sulfur cathode should be as high as possible. In this work, an intercalation-conversion hybrid cathode is proposed by distributing sulfur evenly on electroactive niobium tungsten oxide (Nb18W16O93) and conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for achieving high performance ASSLSBs. Herein, Nb18W16O93 shows good electrochemical lithium storage in the hybrid cathode, which could serve as an effective Li-ion/electron conductor for the conversion of sulfur in the discharge/charge processes to achieve a high utilization of sulfur. However, CNTs could further increase the electronic conductivity of the hybrid cathode by constructing good conductive frameworks and suppress the volumetric fluctuation during the interconversion of sulfur and Li2S. With this strategy, the S/Nb18W16O93/CNT cathode achieves a high sulfur utilization of 91% after one cycle activation with a high gravimetric capacity of 1526 mA h g(-1). In addition, excellent rate performance is also obtained at 0.5 C with a reversible capacity of 1262 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles. This work offers a new perspective to develop ASSLSBs.

However, a well-designed electrocatalyst with abundant active centers to facilitate conversion of LiPSs and prolong the lifespan of Li-S batteries is still required. Herein, a novel heterostructure of polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes composite with hierarchical MnO (MnO/PPy-2) was designed as a host. N-containing functional groups and p-conjugated structures in PPy and polar MnO supply proper trapping ability toward LiPSs. More polar (=C-N+) and Mn-OH bonds are beneficial for electron transfer on conductive PPy substrate, which guarantee the uniform deposition of Li2S. Moreover, the hierarchical structure provides abundant surface and active sites for LiPSs entrapping and catalyzing, avoiding the electric contact loss. The synergetic merits of proper adsorption and conversion make MnO/PPy-2 composite a competitive host in the Li-S field. The cathode (S-MnO/PPy-2) exhibits a superior rate performance and cycling stability enabling 1000 cycles at 1 C with 0.032% capacity loss per cycle. This work paves a way to fabricate and utilize conductive polymer/metal oxides heterostructures as catalyst in Li-S batteries and provides a new sight to understand catalyst design in energy storage devices.

This synthesis route was advantageous since sulfur was loaded simultaneously and caddice-like ball morphologies were formed in one step during spray drying. The unique hierarchical structure and polycrystalline nature of S-ZnO/CNTs microspheres did not only facilitate the physical and chemical confinement of sulfur but also inhibited shuttling behaviors of polysulfides. Therefore, the testing of S-ZnO/CNTs composite as cathodes in Li-S batteries revealed elevated initial specific capacities reaching 1237.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. In addition, the cathodes presented cycling stabilities, with 919.2 mAh g(-1) retained capacitance after 150 cycles. At elevated C-rate of 3 C, the cathodes showed also substantial specific capacities reaching 495.6 mAh g(-1). Overall, the proposed preparation strategy looks promising for preparation of future advanced cathode materials for (Li-S) batteries.

The use of common nonpolar carbon/sulfur composites has proved to be a good way to improve the performance, but they still cannot efficiently trap highly polar lithium polysulfides due to the weak interactions between nonpolar carbon and polar polysulfides. Herein, we report a new strategy of using polar cysteamine groups to trap polar polysulfides, leading to greatly enhanced capacity of similar to 920 mAh g(-1)at 1 C with a high Coulombic efficiency of similar to 99.1%, and a long cycle life of over 600 cycles with a capacity retention higher than 80%. Importantly, in situ UV/Vis spectroscopy was employed to identify intermediates during cycling, which demonstrates the constructed unique polar cysteamine functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can greatly reduce the production of polysulfides and suppress the shuttle effect. The broken-bond model of linear polysulfane during cycling was further demonstrated by density functional theory calculations. The present strategy of using polar cysteamine-functionalized CNTs to trap soluble intermediates is promising and has significant potential for the development of highly efficient lithium sulfur batteries.

The synthesized beta-Mo2C/CNFs with 3D network structure and high surface area are not only conducive to ion transport and electrolyte penetration but also effectively intercept the shuttle of lithium polysulfide by polar surface interaction. Moreover, the reaction kinetics of the batteries enhanced is due to the presence of beta-Mo2C, promoting the solid-state polysulfide conversion reaction in the charge-discharge process. Compared with the batteries with CNF interlayer and without interlayer, the batteries using a beta-Mo2C/CNFs interlayer with a sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2) delivered excellent electrochemical performance because of a facile redox reaction during cycling. The discharge capacity at the first cycle at 0.7 mA cm(-2) was 1360 mAh g(-1), maintaining a specific capacity of 974 mAh g(-1) after 160 cycles. Furthermore, it showed a high-rate capacity of 700 mAh g(-1) at 14 mA cm(-2). This work demonstrates the beta-Mo2C/CNFs as a promising interlayer to exploit Li-S battery commercialization.

In the extraordinary ternary system, the hierarchical NiO hollow structures are tightly wrapped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO), and Sn particles are homogeneously anchored on surface of NiO/RGO composite. This work demonstrated that NiO/RGO-Sn interlayer plays an important role on immobilizing polysulfides, realizing the reactivation of dissolved polysulfides in Li-S batteries. The hierarchical NiO with abundant pores which benefit for polysulfide storage and buffering volume change when acted as interlayers. Simultaneously, RGO with high conductivity serving as upper current collector can significantly improves the electrochemical performance. Besides, NiO and uniformly dispersed Sn particles on the surface of NiO/RGO can effectively prevent the polysulfides from diffusing to the lithium anode by physical and chemical absorption. Immobilizing effect of NiO and Sn for sulfur species and polysulfides is deeply investigated by XPS techniques. The excellent performance of the cell is dominated synergistically by several factors including high electron conductivity of RGO sheets, the abundant pores and the chemical reaction between Sn, NiO species and polysulfides.

Despite numerous efforts concerning this issue, combatting sulfur loss remains one of the greatest challenges. Here we show that this problem can be effectively diminished by controlling the sulfur as smaller allotropes. Metastable small sulfur molecules of S2-4 were synthesized in the confined space of a conductive microporous carbon matrix. The confined S2-4 as a new cathode material can totally avoid the unfavorable transition between the commonly used large S-8 and S-4(2-). Li-S batteries based on this concept exhibit unprecedented electrochemical behavior with high specific capacity, good cycling stability, and superior rate capability, which promise a practicable battery with high energy density for applications in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage systems.

According to the characterization of Co-N-G, there was a homogeneous and dispersed distribution of N and Co active sites embedded in the Co-N-G sample. The 2D sheet-like microstructure and Co, N with a strong binding energy provided significant physical and chemical adsorption functions, which are conducive to the bonding S and suppression of LiPSs. Moreover, the dispersed Co and N as catalysts promoted the reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries via the reutilization of LiPSs and reduced the electrochemical resistance. Thus, the discharge specific capacity in the first cycle for the Co-N-G/S battery reached 1255.7 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C. After 100 cycles, it could still reach 803.0 mA h g(-1), with a retention rate of about 64%. This phenomenon proves that this type of Co-N-G composite with Co and N catalysts plays an effective role in improving the performance of batteries and can be further studied in Li-S batteries.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides hampers their commercial application. Here, a Ca(OH)(2)-carbon framework derived from crab shells is successfully used to design a modified separator for Li-S batteries. Benefiting from the effective dispersal of Ca(OH)(2) in the conductive carbon framework, the Ca(OH)(2)-carbon framework confers two benefits: first, it facilitates electron and ion transfer during redox reactions, and second, it efficiently traps the dissolved polysulfides. An enhanced Li-S performance is achieved by the utilization of a Ca(OH)(2)-carbon framework-modified separator, resulting in an initial capacity of 1215 mA h g(-1) and a high reversible capacity of 873.5 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at a rate of 0.5C. The results of this work show that Ca(OH)(2)-carbon frameworks derived from crab shells could be promising nanostructured materials to improve the performance of Li-S batteries.

In this regard, a sparingly PS solvating electrolyte based on sulfolane and hydrofluoroether is known as a promising concept to enhance the volumetric energy density by increasing the cycling stability. So far, little is known about the impact of the carbon porosity on the electrochemical sulfur utilization. Herein, carbon materials with varying pore diameter and architecture (micropores, mesopores and hierarchical pores) are studied as scaffold for Li-S cathodes using TMS/TTE electrolyte to obtain more insights into the relationship between the carbon scaffold porosity and the modified conversion mechanism of sparingly solvating electrolytes. The electrochemical evaluation under lean conditions (5 mu l mg(S)(-1)) revealed stable cycling performance for all Li-S cathodes. Using microporous electrodes, a reversible quasi-solid-state conversion is detected by an additional third discharge plateau being confirmed by cyclovoltammetry. GITT experiments give evidence that the carbon porosity impacts the reaction kinetics of the polysulfide conversion by using TMS/TTE electrolyte. Based on these findings, new mechanistic insights into the operation of Li-S batteries are provided by using sparingly solvating electrolytes.

However, the practical specific energy and cycle life of Li-S pouch cells are significantly hindered by thin sulfur cathodes, flooded electrolytes and excess Li metal anodes. Here, an ultrathin and highly efficient boron nitride/single-wall carbon nanotube (BN/SWCNT) interlayer (UHEI) achieves excellent Li-S pouch cell performance with high sulfur loading and a lean electrolyte. Compared with the reported interlayer materials, the UHEI can not only hinder the diffusion of polysulfides, but also promote further redox reactions and allow Li+ to pass through easily. Meanwhile, this UHEI can significantly improve lean electrolyte performance (E/S ratio of 8 mu L mg(-1)) and both high and low plateau capacities of Li-S batteries with a high sulfur loading (10 mg cm(-2)). Moreover, a normalized "ratio of the areal loading interlayer to sulfur (I/S)" was proposed and two "interlayer efficiency index (IEI)" were obtained by using I/S to quantify the efficiency of interlayers at a certain current density and guide the design of high-efficiency interlayers. The IEI of our UHEI@PP is dozens of times higher than previously reported results. Li-S cells with UHEI@PP delivered a remarkable discharge capacity of 6.6 mA h cm(-2) after 100 cycles at 0.2C for pouch cells (4.1 mg cm(-2) per side, E/S ratio of 10 mu L mg(-1)). The work provides new insights into separator modification for the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries in the future.

Herein, a multifunctional CNT based interlayer was obtained by a simple polyelectrolyte (PDDA-TFSI) modified method. Due to the electro-positivity of PDDA-TFSI and the electronic coupling between CNT and PDDA-TFSI, the CNT/PDDA-TFSI inter layer exhibits a strong adsorption and effective catalysis towards polysulfides. Furthermore, the continuous CNT network ensures the successful electron transport during the charge-discharge process. As expected, the electrochemical properties of Li-S battery can be promoted significantly with the assistance of CNT/ PDDA-TFSI interlayer. Even after 300 cycles, the CNT/PDDA-TFSI interlayer-based Li-S battery also delivers a higher capacity retention of 79.2%, proceeding Li-S batteries with and without CNT interlayer. This work proves that CNT/PDDA-TFSI film as a multifunctional interlayer has a promising application in advanced Li-S battery. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we present a unique porous sulfur composite consisting of a porous sulfur particle coating with conductive hydrogel polypyrrole, which is prepared through a templated method. The pores inside the sulfur particles offer a good buffering space for the volume expansion of sulfur upon lithiation; while the external polypyrrole coating improves the conductivity and suppress the transfer of polysulfides. The porous sulfur@polypyrrole composite exhibits a capacity of about 900 mAh g(-1) after cycling for 100 times at 0.12 C, along with a good Coulombic efficiency around 99.9%, which is much better than the polypyrrole-coated non-porous sulfur particles and pure sulfur particles. When cycled for 500 times, the capacity fading rate is as low as 0.09% per cycle. After three rounds of rate-performance measurements, the capacity retention of the sulfur@polypyrrole at different rates remain above 97%. The density functional theory calculations and electrochemical impedance spectra demonstrate a polysulfide-adsorptive and a stable electric transportation surface of the sulfur@polypyrrole composite, respectively.

The in-situ polymerized PPy layer in this special structure is helpful to inhibit aggregation of sulfur particles with small size, the polysulfide dissolution and shuttling, and offer fast and efficient transport of electron/lithium ion within the electrode. Besides, the flexible PPy layer effectively accommodates the volume expansion. PPy with partial PO43- doping was also employed to improve cycling stability and C-rate performance of S@PPy composite by exchanging a with PO43-. Thus, the sulfur electrode with a high sulfur loading of 80% delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1142 mA h g(-1) and maintained a high capacity of 805 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. The corresponding capacity retention over 100 cycles was about 65%, with a limited decay of 0.3% per cycle. Even at a high current density of 1.5 C, the composite still exhibited a high discharge capacity of about 700 mA h g(-1). This results mean that the designed electrode can achieve a high practical specific energy density of more than 400 W h/kg, far beyond the commercial LiCoO2 batteries. Due to low cost, facile large-scale synthesis and superior electrochemical performance of S@PPy cathode with high sulfur loading, this work will provide a very promising method to further promote the Li-S batteries in the practical application of portable electronic devices, electric devices and energy storage system.

The electrochemical activity of insulating elemental sulfur as the positive electrode was enhanced by the mutual dispersion of elemental sulfur and carbon in the composite powders. Subsequently, a tight interface between the sulfur-carbon composite and the LiBH4 powders was manifested only by cold-pressing owing to the highly deformable nature of the LiBH4 electrolyte. The high reducing ability of LiBH4 allows using the use of a Li negative electrode that enhances the energy density. The results demonstrate the interface modification of insulating sulfur and the architecture of an all-solid-state Li-S battery configuration with high energy density. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Herein, a facile synthesis of mesoporous graphene platelets (NSGs) with in situ nitrogen and sulfur doping by the pyrolysis of a self-assembled L-cysteine precursor on sodium chloride crystal surface for structure-directing is presented. The mesoporous lamellar structure of the NSG possesses a uniform distribution of pyrrolic N, pyridinic N, and thiosulphate structured heteroatoms originating from in situ doping, which promotes the confinement of intermediate polysulfides. Combining the strong interactions with soluble polysulfide, flexible mesoporous architecture, and high conductivity of graphene, the prepared NSG material exhibited a high initial capacity of 1433 mA h g(-1) at a 2C rate as well as a reversible capacity of 684 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. This demonstrates that the in situ nitrogen and sulfur doped thin lamellar structure of graphene would be a promising cathode material for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we improved the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries by covalently immobilizing the discharge products on carbon nanofibers by using cysteamine as a medium, which enabled us to achieve unprecedented capacity retention of similar to 87.6% after 500 cycles at a current rate of 1C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)) with high sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2). Significantly, in situ UV/vis spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of the electrolyte offered direct evidence for the proposed mechanism. No detectable signals of dissoluble polysulfides in the electrolyte were observed at any intermediate states, indicating the effect of covalent bonds on the reduction of long-chain polysulfide Li2Sx (4 < x <= 8) production. Theoretically, DFT calculations indicated the presence of different S-S bond lengths in linear polysulfanes and verified the presence of short-chain polysulfide Li2Sx (1 <= x <= 4) intermediates during discharge. This strategy provides an important way to solve one of the essential issues limiting the commercial applications of Li-S batteries.

However, the shuttle of polysulfide induces rapid poor cycling stability of lithium-sulfur cells. Using an interlayer inserted between the sulfur cathode and the separator to capture these soluble intermediates can diminish this effect effectively. Herein, a ultrathin TiO2 nanotubes/graphene oxide (TiO2 NTs/GO) hybrid membrane (the thickness is less than 10 mm) used as an interlayer in lithium sulfur battery can effectively improve the cycle performance by trapping the soluble polysulfides. As a result, the sulfur cathode with TiO2 NTs/GO hybrid membrane as interlayer exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1431.5 mA h g(-1) and maintains the reversible capacity of 845.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C after 100 cycles.

The electrochemical measurements of PC-Li-Nafion membrane show that its Li-ion transference number is 0.928, ionic conductivity of 2.1 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) can be achieved at 70 degrees C and its electrochemical window is 0 similar to +4.1 V vs. Li+ /Li. It is observed that the Li dendrites are suppressed by using PC-Li-Nafion membrane due to its single-ion conducting property. The amounts of Li-Nafion resin binder and conductive carbon in the cathode are optimized as 40% and 10% respectively to make a balance of ionic and electronic conductivities. A thin-layer Li-Nafion resin with a thickness of around 2 pm is fabricated between the cathode and PC-Li-Nafion membrane to improve the interfacial contact and further enhance the specific capacity of the cell. When measured at 70 degrees C, the Li-S cell delivers a reversible specific capacity of 1072.8 mAh g(-1) (S) at 0.05 C and 895 mAh g(-1) (S) at 1 C. The capacity retention at 1 C is 89% after 100 cycles. These results suggest that high-performance solid-state Li-S cells can be fabricated with the Li-Nafion polymer electrolyte.

Herein, a lithium-rich conjugated sulfur-incorporated, polymeric material based on poly(Li2S6-r-1,3-diisopropenylbenzene) (DIB) is developed as a cathode material for high rate and stable Li-S batteries. Motivated by extra Li+ ions affording fast Li+ redox kinetics across the conjugated aromatic backbones, the Li-rich sulfur-based copolymer exhibits high delivery capacities (934 mAh g(-1) at 120 cycles), impressive rate capabilities (727 mAh g(-1) even under a current of 2 A g(-1)), and long electrochemical cycling performance over 500 cycles. Moreover, by use of the elastic nature and thermoplastic properties of the sulfur-incorporated, polymeric material, a prototype of a flexible Li-S pouch cell is constructed by using a poly(Li2S6-r-DIB) copolymer cathode and paired with the flexible carbon cloth/Si/Li anode, which exhibits stable electrochemical performance (658 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles) and operational capability even under folding at various angle (30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, 150 degrees, 180 degrees). This work extends the molecular-design approach to obtaining a high-performance organosulfur cathode material by introducing extra Li+ ions to promote redox kinetics, which provides valuable guidance for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries for practical applications.

Unfortunately, the N-C interface as a critical chemical active site is still short of a deep and detail understanding owing to the difficulty of interfacial structure engineering on the molecular scale. In this work, an interwoven coaxial cable network with ultrahigh nitrogen content of 9.56 wt% has been successfully fabricated through engineering a rationally designed Schiff-base chemistry. This in-situ bottom-up strategy enables the targeted heteroatom doping throughout the entire networks on molecular scale. Thus, a homogenous interface between nitrogen and carbon matrix can be achieved even at such a high doping level, which is demonstrated to play the key role in facilitating the chemical absorption of sulfur/polysulfides, and eventually improving the cycling stability of the electrode. Consequently, the composite demonstrates outstanding long cycling performance with a high specific capacity of 729 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles and a superior rate capability. The bottom-up strategy for fabricating the N-doped carbon networks will open up a new avenue for deeply understanding the critical role of interface in rational designing of N-doped carbon materials.

Formation of Large Polysulfide Complexes during the Lithium-Sulfur Battery Discharge	PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED			English	Article							LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; GRAPHENE; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; MOLECULES; MECHANISM; CAPACITY; OXIDE	Sulfur cathodes have much larger capacities than transition-metal-oxide cathodes used in commercial lithium-ion batteries but suffer from unsatisfactory capacity retention and long-term cyclability. Capacity degradation originates from soluble lithium polysulfides gradually diffusing into the electrolyte. Understanding of the formation and dynamics of soluble polysulfides during the discharging process at the atomic level remains elusive, which limits further development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Here we report first-principles molecular dynamics simulations and density functional calculations, through which the discharging products of Li-S batteries are studied. We find that, in addition to simple Li2Sn (1 <= n <= 8) clusters generated from single cyclooctasulfur (S-8) rings, large Li-S clusters form by collectively coupling several different rings to minimize the total energy. At high lithium concentration, a Li-S network forms at the sulfur surfaces. The results can explain the formation of the soluble Li-S complex, such as Li2S8, Li2S6, and Li2S4, and the insoluble Li2S2 and Li2S structures. In addition, we show that the presence of oxygen impurities in graphene, particularly oxygen atoms bonded to vacancies and edges, may stabilize the lithium polysulfides that may otherwise diffuse into the electrolyte.

Enhancement in Electrochemical Performance of Lithium-Sulfur Cells through Sulfur Encapsulation in Hollow Carbon Nanospheres Coated with Ultra-Thin Aluminum Fluoride Layer	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						Aluminum Fluoride; Cyclic Voltammetry; Lithium; Li-S Batteries; Polysulfide Shuttle	FLUORINATED ETHER; GRAPHENE-OXIDE; CATHODE MATERIALS; LI; BATTERIES; COMPOSITE; LICOO2; NANOPARTICLES; NANOTUBES; ELECTRODE	The current status of cathode materials for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is not satisfactory for full-scale commercial production. This mainly stems from the unsolved problems associated with the polysulfide shuttle, which leads to lower sulfur utilization and significant capacity decay after a few hundred cycles. To better confine sulfur and its associated polysulfides, a core/double-shelled nanocomposite was synthesized. The inner shell was composed of a carbon nanosphere with high conductivity, while the outer shell was an ultra-thin aluminum fluoride (AlF3) layer to better retain polysulfides in the cathode structure. The AlF3 coating increased the initial discharge capacity to 1191 mA h g(-1) with capacity retention of 76.3% and Coulombic efficiency > 99% over 100 cycles. Taking advantage of this tailored design, a reversible capacity of 702 mA h g(-1) over 500 cycles at 1 C was achieved with only 0.052% capacity decay per cycle. This impressive electrochemical performance was ascribed to the enhanced conductivity and effective entrapment of polysulfides.

Nevertheless, previous research simply attributed the performance improvement of sulfur cathodes to the chemical adsorption ability of polar metal compounds toward lithium polysulfides (LPS), while a deep understanding of the enhanced electrochemical performance in these various sulfur hosts, especially at the molecular levels, is still unclear. Herein, for a mechanistic understanding of superior metal phosphide host in Li-S battery chemistry, an integrated phosphide-based host of CF/FePRC (carbon cloth with grown FeP@C nanotube arrays) is chosen as the model, and this binder-free cathode can exclude interference from the binder and conductive additives. With a systematic electrochemical investigation of the loading sulfur in such oxide-and phosphide-based hosts (CF/Fe3O4@C and CF/FeP@C), it is found that CF/FeP@C@S shows much superior Li-S performances. The greatly enhanced performance of CF/FeP@C@S suggests that FeP can well suppress the shuttle effect of LPS and accelerate their transformation during the charge discharge process. The first-principles calculations reveal the performance variations of Fe3O4 and FeP in Li-S batteries mainly because the shifts of the p band of the FeP could accelerate the interfacial electronics transfer dynamics by increasing the electronic concentration in the Fermi level of adsorbed Li2S4. The current work sheds light on the promising design of superior Li-S batteries from both theoretical and experimental aspects.

For the first time, we advocate a recently synthesized two-dimensional material, biphenylene, as an anchoring material for the lithium-sulfur battery. The density functional theory calculations show that LiPSs bind with pristine biphenylene insubstantially with binding energy ranging from -0.21 eV to -1.22 eV. However, defect engineering through a single C atom vacancy significantly improves the binding strength (binding energy in the range -1.07 to -4.11 eV). The Bader analysis reveals that LiPSs and S8 clusters donate the charge (ranging from -0.05 e to -1.12 e) to the biphenylene sheet. The binding energy of LiPSs with electrolytes is smaller than those with the defective biphenylene sheet, which provides its potential as an anchoring material. Compared with other reported two-dimensional materials such as graphene, MXenes, and phosphorene, the biphenylene sheet exhibits higher binding energies with the polysulfides. Our study deepens the fundamental understanding and shows that the biphenylene sheet is an excellent anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries for suppressing the shuttle effect because of its superior conductivity, porosity, and strong anchoring ability.

The sulfur-CNT composite film with an areal density of similar to 5 mg cm(-2) has a high sulfur content of 65 wt % and is tough enough to be directly employed as the cathode in Li-S cells without binders, conductive additives, and current collectors. The porous and film-like CNT matrices enormously improve the electrical conductivity of sulfur and offer 3D pathways for fast Li ion diffusion, while the strong covalent bonds formed between sulfur and CNTs ensure the stability of sulfur during charge/discharge. Consequently, the film electrode delivers an initial capacity of 1100 mA h g(-1) and can retain a reversible capacity of 740 mA h g(-1) after 100 charge/discharge cycles at 0.1 C. It also shows good rate capability that a reversible capacity of 520 mA h g(-1) can be reached at the rate of 2 C. Moreover, the high sulfur content gives rise to a high energy density of similar to 1200 W h kg(-1) based on the total mass of the electrode.

However, its practical application is impeded by severe "shuttle effect" and low cycle stability. As a consequence, in this work, we report N-doped carbon nanospheres (N-CNSs) composited with S as cathode for Li-S batteries. The stacked carbon nanosphere structure can not only improve the conductivity of cathode, but also work as barriers to retard diffusion of intermediate polysulfide. Owing to the unique structure, the N-CNSs/S cathode exhibits superior electrochemical performances with high specific capacity (1228 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), and excellent rate capability as well as good cyclic life. Our smart designed strategy may promote the development of high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the potential of Li-S batteries has not yet been realized because of several technical barriers. Poor electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the low electrical conductivity of the fully charged and discharged species, the irreversible loss of polysulfide anions and the decrease in the number of electrochemically active reaction sites during battery operation. Here, we report that the introduction of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) into the sulfur cathode dramatically enhanced sulfur/sulfide utilization, yielding high performance. In addition, the GQDs induced structural integrity of the sulfur-carbon electrode composite by oxygen-rich functional groups. This hierarchical architecture enabled fast charge transfer while minimizing the loss of lithium polysulfides, which is attributed to the physicochemical properties of GQDs. The mechanisms through which excellent cycling and rate performance are achieved were thoroughly studied by analyzing capacity versus voltage profiles. Furthermore, experimental observations and theoretical calculations further clarified the role played by GQDs by proving that C-S bonding occurs. Thus, the introduction of GQDs into Li-S batteries will provide an important breakthrough allowing their use as high-performance and low-cost batteries for next-generation energy storage systems.

The Li2S6 catholyte was added in the fibrous CSCNC network as the current free electrode for Li-S batteries, which was used as the positive catalyst to restrain the shuttle effect and facilitate the reaction kinetics. Additionally, CoS2 and Co are dual functional electrocatalysts for facilitating lithium sulfide nucleation onto the surface of CSCNC, thus reduce electrochemical polarization and enhance the specific capacity. This CSCNC@Li2S6 electrode exhibits 877 mAh g(-1) capacity retention with sulfur loading of 7.11 mg over 200 cycles and has an average decay of 0.11% per cycle. Additionally, the composite electrode with sulfur loading accomplishes up to 14.22 mg, providing 12.7 mAh of extremely high capacity, which is much higher than that of the carbon-based electrodes for Li-S batteries.

Herein, we construct artificial lithium isopropyl-sulfide macromolecules as an ion-selective interface on the Li metal (IS-Li) by a facile electrochemical polymerization method, in which the polymer network improves the elasticity and toughness to accommodate the volume change of the Li anode and the formed lithium-organosulfides provide great mechanical strength to resist the destruction of Li dendrites. Importantly, this interfacial layer is proved to be sufficient in damping polysulfide anion diffusion and stopping irreversible reduction between polysulfides and metallic Li, which greatly contribute to the performance improvement of Li-S batteries. The resulting Li-S batteries exhibit long-term stability with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency. This effective strategy sets a new approach for regulating the interfacial chemistry of Li metal anodes, which is significant for highly stable Li-S batteries.

However, the "shuttle effect" of the sulfur cathode, resulting in poor cyclic performance, is a big barrier for the development of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel sulfur cathode integrating sulfur, flexible carbon cloth, and metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived N-doped carbon nanoarrays with embedded CoP (CC@CoP/C) is designed. These unique flexible nanoarrays with embedded polar CoP nanoparticles not only offer enough voids for volume expansion to maintain the structural stability during the electrochemical process, but also promote the physical encapsulation and chemical entrapment of all sulfur species. Such designed CC@CoP/C cathodes with synergistic confinement (physical adsorption and chemical interactions) for soluble intermediate lithium polysulfides possess high sulfur loadings (as high as 4.17 mg cm(-2)) and exhibit large specific capacities at different C-rates. Specially, an outstanding long-term cycling performance can be reached. For example, an ultralow decay of 0.016% per cycle during the whole 600 cycles at a high current density of 2C is displayed. The current work provides a promising design strategy for high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

However, their practical commercialization is still facing many intractable problems, of which the most difficult is the shuttle effect of dissolved polysulfides. To restrict the shuttle of polysulfides, herein, a novel double-layer lithium aluminate/nitrogen-doped hollow carbon sphere (LiAlO2/NdHCSs)-modified separator was designed. The upper NdHCSs layer on the separator works as the first barrier to physically and chemically adsorb polysulfides, whereas the bottom LiAlO2 layer acts as the second barrier to physically block the polysulfides without restricting the Li+ transport due to the high ionic conductivity of LiAlO2. Cells with the LiAlO2/NdHCSs-modified separator showed an initial discharge capacity of 1500 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, and a discharge capacity of 543.3 mA h g(-1) was obtained after 500 cycles at 2C. Especially, when the areal density of the active material was increased to 4.5 mg cm(-2), the cells retained a discharge capacity of 538.6 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5C. The outstanding electrochemical performance of Li-S cells with the LiAlO2/NdHCSs-modified separators show a new approach for the applications of Li-S batteries.

However, severe shuttle effect and sluggish redox reaction kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), resulting in unsatisfactory rate performance and cycling stability, greatly hinder the further development of LSBs. Herein, we successfully synthesized a hollow structured Co-Fe layered double hydroxide (Co-Fe LDH). This Co-Fe LDH could inhibit the diffusion and accelerate the redox reaction kinetics of LiPSs, indicating that Co-Fe LDH is an effective adsorption/catalytic bifunctional sulfur host. When served as a cathode material for LSBs, the sulfur-loaded Co-Fe LDH (Co-Fe LDH@S) delivers a high specific capacity and outstanding cyclic stability with a low average capacity decay rate at 1 C. This composite cathode also displays excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 530.7 mAh g-1 at 2 C. The results demonstrate that the Co-Fe LDH@S composites are a promising cathode for high-performance LSBs.

To address these issues, a sodium alginate (SA)-derived affinity laminated chromatography membrane built-in electrode is designed. This is the first attempt to utilize this type of membrane, which is widely used for the selective adsorption of proteins, in the battery field. An ordered multilayer structure throughout the electrode can easily be obtained, and the number of membrane layers can be also conveniently controlled by varying the cross-linking time of SA. The PS shuttling effect is efficiently suppressed and the permeability of PSs is reduced by enveloping the carbon/sulfur powder in ultrathin laminated chromatography membranes. As a result, these designed electrodes deliver a superhigh initial capacity of 1492 mA h g(-1), with a capacity retention almost 20% higher than the contrast. This low-cost and easily mass-producible strategy inspired by affinity chromatography is expected to effectively solve the PS shuttling problem toward high-loading and long-lifetime Li-S batteries in practice.

Unfortunately, the high dissolution of polysulfides and the low conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide lead to a fast capacity decay and a poor specific capacity of the sulfur cathode, which impedes the further development of lithium-sulfur batteries. To overcome these issues, we propose a 3D binder-free collector via in situ-grown polar TiO2 nanowires on carbon-nanofibers, which can successfully suppress the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides and improve the electron conductivity of the sulfur cathode. The prepared TiO2-nanowires arrays provide a large surface area for sulfur loading and a convenient path for electron transfer. These characteristics result in a high ion diffusion capacity of up to 699 mA h g(-1) with an excellent coulombic efficiency, higher than 98.5% after 300 cycles at 1.0 C, and a capacity decay as low as 0.075% per cycle.

The NMAP interlayer has a three-dimensional porous structure, which not only reduces the loss of active materials, but also captures soluble polysulfides; NMAP material has strong chemical adsorption capacity for adsorbing polysulfide. The morphology and structure of the composite interlayer were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical test results showed that the first discharge capacity of electrode with NMAP interlayer reached 1 437 mAh.g(-1) at a rate of 0.050, and the utilization rate of active material was as high as 85.8%. The specific discharge capacity still reached 668 mAh . g(-1) at 4C, and the coulomb efficiency remained at 99.1% showing excellent magnification and cycling performance.

As one type of promising Li battery, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have an advantage of high theoretical energy density (2600 W h kg(-1)). Nevertheless, the notorious polysulfide shuttle and low sulfur loading are the main obstacles to widespread practical utilization of Li-S batteries. To tackle these issues, we design and construct a pyrrole modified graphene aerogel foam (Py-GF) by a simple hydrothermal and freeze drying method as the sulfur host, where pyrrole provides strong chemical bonding for polysulfide anchoring and graphene aerogel foam serves as a matrix to enhance the conductivity as well as increase the sulfur loading of the cathode simultaneously. The Py-GF@S cathode, with a high sulfur loading of about 6.2 mg cm(-2), displays an improved initial specific capacity (1220 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and 985.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C) and cycle stability (capacity retention of 81% after 100 cycles at 0.5C). We anticipate that the work described here will be helpful to develop Li-S batteries that meet the requirements of practical applications.

XPS reveals the formation of strong chemical bonding (-C-S-C- and C-SOx-C (x = 2-4)) in the structure of SNC materials. Moreover, the results demonstrate that SNC-S composites showed higher specific capacity and better cycle performance than the pristine nitrogen co-doped carbon material (NC)/sulfur (NC-S) composites. Except for providing more lithium storage sites due to faradaic reactions, the incorporation of sulfur not only immobilizes the sulfur and polysulfide species, thus improving the interfacial characterization between the electrode and the electrolyte, but also influences the reversible dissolving balance of long-chain polysulfides and suppresses the "shuttle effect", resulting in better electrochemical behavior. This facile approach of the SNC matrix could provide a practical research direction for lithium sulfur batteries.

The primary issues that hinder the practical applications of this system include its poor utilization of sulfur, limited cycle life and retarded rate performance. In the present study, hemp-derived carbon (C-hemp) is made into a composite with room temperature-synthesized MnO2, which acts as a host for sulfur in the lithium-sulfur battery system. The composite material is characterized physico-chemically and electrochemically using various techniques. This composite exhibits better electrochemical performance as a sulfur carrier compared to pristine carbon. An initial specific capacity of 926 mA h g(-1) is obtained at 0.1 C for C-hemp/MnO2-sulfur, which surpasses that of the C-hemp-sulfur sample. C-hemp provides a conductive matrix as well as porous sites for the accommodation of sulfur, while MnO2 exhibits the ability to absorb polysulfide chemically. Thus, this composite is established as a potential cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Nevertheless, the notorious shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) seriously impedes its practical applications. Here, we report an all-CVD approach to realize the direct growth of ReS2@N-doped graphene (NG) heterostructure, which serves as an ultralight high-performance interlayer for elevated LiPS regulation via easy transfer onto the commercial separator. In contrast to the traditional interlayers constructed via vacuum filtration of nanostructured materials that inevitably increase the thickness and weight of the separator, our all-CVD-enabled ReS2@NG film possesses an area of 15 mm x 100 mm, a thickness of similar to 0.5 mu m and a negligible areal weight of 80-90 mu g cm(-2). Benefiting from the two-dimensional (2D) vertically-erected nanostructure, adsorptive ReS2-conductive NG interface, and favorable electrical conductivity, thus-derived ReS2@NG interlayer readily enhances reaction kinetics for LiPS conversion and boosts the reutilization of trapped LiPS whilst guaranteeing smooth transportation of lithium ions. Accordingly, an initial discharge capacity of 854 mAh g(-1) with an average capacity decay of 0.064% per cycle after 800 cycles can be harvested at 2.0 C. Even at a high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm(-2), an initial areal capacity of 6.1 mAh cm(-2) can be gained, which still retains 5.8 mAh cm(-2) after 40 cycles at 0.1 C. This work is anticipated to shed light upon the construction of CVD-enabled versatile 2D heterostructures for enriching the interlayer design with multi-functionality and cost-effectiveness.

However, its traditional fabrication process is complex, which makes it difficult to reasonably control the content and distribution of each component. In this work, to rationally design the heterostructure, the atomic layer deposition is utilized to hybridize the TiO2-TiN heterostructure with the three-dimensional carbon nanotube sponge. Through optimizing the deposited thickness of TiO2 and TiN layers and adopting the annealing post-treatment, the derived coaxial sponge with uniform TiN-TiO2 heterostructure exhibits the best catalytic ability. The corresponding lithium-sulfur battery shows enhanced electrochemical performance with high specific capacity of 1289 mAh g(-1) at 1C and capacity retention of 85% after 500 cycles at 2C. Furthermore, benefiting from the highly porous structure and interconnected conductive pathways from the sponge, its areal capacity reaches up to 21.5 mAh cm(-2). It is challenging to optimize catalytic heterostructures for lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Here, authors prepare nanometer-scale TiN-TiO2 heterostructures via atomic layer deposition on carbon nanotube sponge to realize stable Li-S batteries with high areal capacity and improved rate capability.

However, practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are severely limited by the short cycle life caused by the polysulfide shuttling (PSS) effect. Herein, we report on a PSS-resistant yet redox-active sulfur host containing N-doped carbon dodecahedra supported cobalt single atoms (denoted as Co-SAs@NC) derived from a binary Co-Zn MOF-precursor. The results show that the sulfur cathode built on the Co-SAs@NC is electrocatalytically active towards soluble-polysulfides-to- insoluble-Li2S conversion, thus mitigating the detrimental PSS effect. The LSB using this new sulfur host exhibits a 600-cycle stable operation with a capacity of 737 mAh g(-1) at 1C and 2.0 mg cm(-2) S-loading. At a higher sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm(-2), it can still deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1069 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and maintain 400 mAh g(-1) at 1C for 150 cycles. Theoretical analysis suggests that the Co-N-4 moiety in the Co-SAs@NC is fundamentally responsible for the observed activity and stability.

However, shuttle effect is one of the main problems that restrict the commercial application of Li-S batteries. Apart from it, accelerating the dissociation of Li2S to LiS and Li+ is also very important to achieve high Coulombic efficiency. Recently, it has been found that metal atoms exhibit strong interactions with lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx), which can be used as single-atom catalysts by embedding in the matrix. Covalent organic framework (COF) materials have porous structures and large surface area, which can anchor Li2Sx by introducing active sites. In this study, we constructed metal phthalocyanine COFs (MPc-COFs, M = Ti, V, Mn, Cu, and Zn) as the cathode, which combined the advantages of metal atoms and COFs. The adsorption and catalysis performance of Li2Sx species were investigated by MPc-COF cathode using density functional theory. The results show that the strong adsorption capacity of TiPc-COF and VPc-COF and the formation of axial complexes make them unfavorable for Li-S batteries. MnPc-COFs show excellent conductivity and sulfur fixation capacity, which also have a lower energy barrier in the catalytic oxidation of Li2S. This work has a guiding significance in the design of catalytic electrodes for Li-S batteries.

The reaction was driven by thermal heat from the exothermic recombination of Na+ and Cl- (or F-) ions into NaCl (or NaF) salts. The result was an increase of the overall system temperature up to 1320-1750 degrees C followed by the simultaneous formation of sodium halide-carbon coreeshell nanoparticles. Therefore, hollow carbon nanospheres with diameter and shell thickness of similar to 50-500 nm and similar to 10-50 nm, respectively, were produced after water washing of the reaction product. The composite cathode materials for Li-S batteries were manufactured by infiltrating sulfur into the hollow core of nanospheres. The electrochemical cycling showed discharge capacity of similar to 700 mAh g(-1) (after 100 cycles) at 0.5 degrees C current rate which is more than similar to 2.4 times larger than that for the sulfur/carbon black composites prepared by the same technique. The enhancement of battery performance was attributed to the well-organized and unique 3D structure of hollow carbon, enabling better utilization of sulfur. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although many scientific issues have been well solved, the low-cost and green synthesis of the sulfur host to realize efficient electrochemical conversions between polysulfides and sulfur needs more consideration for commercial application. Herein, Co nanocrystal encapsulated in 3D nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (Co@NC) is produced in gram-scale via a simple pressure-cooking strategy by using biomass as raw material. The heterogeneous catalyst was featured by an oval morphology consisting of a tremendous amount of mesopores. The Co nanocrystals in the 3D mesoporous carbon could promote the confinement and fast conversion of polysulfides; simultaneously, the 3D hollow oval morphologies could not only substantially relieve the volume change of the cathode part but also enhance the lithium-ion transportation. Consequently, a sulfur cathode within Co@NC with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg/cm(2) exhibits significantly improved cycle stability with a fade of 0.17% per cycle over 200 cycles. Our works prove the beneficial effects of heterogeneous catalysis in polysulfide conversion reactions and provide a green, facile, scalable, and low-cost synthetic strategy of advanced hollow carbon monolith for high-performance Li-S batteries.

CeO2 nano-crystal with abundant -OH and -NO2 was used as the additive in the sulfur cathode. The additive can adsorb sulfur and lithium polysulfides during charge/discharge process, suppressing the dissloving and migrating of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte. Thus the "shuttle effect" caused by dissloving of lithium polysulfides can be evidently inhibited, resulting in the enhanced cycle performance and the improved coulombic efficiency of Li-S battery. Furthermore, CeO2 nano-crystal with abundant -OH and -NO2 is beneficial to enhance the wettability between electrolyte and sulfur cathode, improving the utilization rate of active material. With 5wt% CeO2 nano-crystal added in the sulfur cathode, the discharge capacities at 0.1C and 0.5C (1C=1675 mA/g) after 100 cycles are as high as 750 mAh/g and 598 mAh/g, respectively, both much higher than those of the sulfur cathode without CeO2 nanocrystal. Simultaneously, the resistance of the cell is also reduced evidently before and after cycling owing to the addition of CeO2 nano-crystal in the cathode.

It was found that the GO/CNT-S composites showed the enhanced charge transfer by conducting network of GO/CNT and the improved sulfide ion movement. It is related to the improved surface area, because positively charged CNT would be used as a modifier for graphene sheets exfoliation. Electrochemical performances of prepared composites were evaluated in lithium-ion cells by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. When applied as the cathode material in lithium sulfur cells, GO/CNT-S composites exhibited a high reversible capacity of 1152.9 mAh g(-1) in the first cycle and maintain a satisfactory cyclability. The results indicate that the GO/CNT-S composites based lithium sulfur cells have a potential to replace the current lithium-ion cells.

However, Li-S battery still exhibits significant challenge for commercial application due to the "shuttle effect". Here, we prepare a composite of Cr2O3-decorated carbon nanofibers (Cr-CNFs) inherited from natural collagen fibers of solid leather wastes (SLWs) and design a multifunctional separator coating for high-performance Li-S batteries. The physical blocking effect of the fibrous morphology of Cr-CNFs and the chemical adsorption by nano Cr2O3 phase in Cr-CNFs could synergistically trap polysulfides to suppress the shuttle effect in Li-S batteries. Moreover, the Cr-CNFs can form conductive network in the as-prepared separator coating, which facilitates the efficient utilization of active materials, due to its specific fibrous structure. Our results demonstrate a superior capacity retention (similar to 810 mAh g(-1) after 260 cycles at 0.2 C, < 0.1% decay rate per cycle), long cycle life, and high coulombic efficiency (> 95%) for the Li-S batteries built with our Cr-CNFs separator coating. The high performance of Li-S battery with Cr-CNFs separator coating as well as the efficient reutilization of SLWs make the Cr-CNFs a promising material for Li-S batteries.

J	Zhu, FS; Zhang, MG; Wang, L; Cao, XY				Zhu, Fengshuai; Zhang, Mingang; Wang, Ling; Cao, Xiangyu			Synthesis and electrochemical performance of CeO2@CNTs/S composite cathode for Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Hydrothermal reaction; Cerium-oxide-doped carbon nanotubes; Composite; Lithium polysulfides	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; MICROPOROUS CARBON; NANOPARTICLES; POLYSULFIDES; POLYANILINE; NANOSPHERES; ELECTRODES; CONVERSION; GROWTH; HOST	The shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is one of the crucial factors restraining its commercial application, because LiPSs (lithium polysulfides) usually leads to poor cycle life and low coulomb efficiency. Some studies have shown that metal oxides can adsorb soluble polysulfides. Herein, CeO2 (cerium-oxide)-doped carbon nanotubes (CeO2@CNTs) were prepared by the hydrothermal method. The polar metal oxide CeO2 enhanced the chemisorption of the cathode to LiPSs and promoted the redox reaction of the cathode through catalysis properties. Meanwhile, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) enhanced cathode conductivity and achieved more sulfur loading. The strategy could alleviate polysulfide shuttling and accelerate redox kinetics, improving Li-S batteries' electrochemical performances. As a result, the CeO2@CNTs/S composite cathode showed the excellent capacity of 1437.6 mAh g(-1) in the current density of 167.5 mA g(-1) at 0.1 C, as well as a long-term cyclability with an inferior capacity decay of 0.17% per cycle and a superhigh coulombic efficiency of 100.434% within 300 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance was attributed to the polar adsorption of CeO2 on polysulfides and the excellent conductivity of CNTs.

Herein, an innovative sulfur host is proposed, based on an iodine-doped bismuth selenide (I-Bi2Se3), able to solve these limitations by immobilizing the LiPS and catalytically activating the redox conversion at the cathode. The synthesis of I-Bi2Se3 nanosheets is detailed here and their morphology, crystal structure, and composition are thoroughly. Density-functional theory and experimental tools are used to demonstrate that I-Bi2Se3 nanosheets are characterized by a proper composition and micro- and nano-structure to facilitate Li+ diffusion and fast electron transportation, and to provide numerous surface sites with strong LiPS adsorbability and extraordinary catalytic activity. Overall, I-Bi2Se3/S electrodes exhibit outstanding initial capacities up to 1500 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and cycling stability over 1000 cycles, with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.012% per cycle at 1 C. Besides, at a sulfur loading of 5.2 mg cm(-2), a high areal capacity of 5.70 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C is obtained with an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 12 mu L mg(-1). This work demonstrated that doping is an effective way to optimize the metal selenide catalysts in LSBs.

However, the notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides and low areal sulfur loading still hinder its practical application. Herein, a nitrogen-enriched hierarchical porous carbon (NEPC) was prepared via a one-step activation process, which is simultaneously served as a coating layer on the polypropylene (PP) separator and sulfur-host material in cathode, acting as a physical barrier for blocking the migration of polysulfides, playing an important role in chemical and/or physical adsorption of polysulfides, and thus significantly improving the electrochemical performance in a Li-S battery with good prospects for the practical application. Specifically, a Li-S battery assembled by a modified separator with an optimum coating thickness and S/NEPC cathode with high areal sulfur loading of 7.1 mg cm(-2) shows superior electrochemical performance, with high specific and areal capacities of respective similar to 950 mAh.g(-1) and similar to 6.8 rnAh.g(-2) as well as stable cycle capability at 0.2C (1C = 1675 mkg(-1)) rate. This dual polysulfides confinement strategy provides new guidance to rational design of multifunctional carbon-based materials for boosting the performance of a practical Li-S battery.

However, their experimental data are mostly based on cathodes with low sulfur mass loading, while the practical application of Li-S cells requires cathodes with high sulfur loading (>= 4 mg cm(-2)) and high sulfur content (>= 70 wt%). Thus, research on the effects of such coatings on Li-S cells with high sulfur loading is essential. Herein, we demonstrate the effectiveness of an oxidized multiwall carbon nanotube (o-MWCNT) coating (0.4 mg cm(-2)) for improving the electrochemical performance of cathodes with sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm(-2). Due to the physical and chemical trapping of polysulfides, efficient electron conduction and fast ion transport induced by the coating, the fabricated Li-S batteries show dramatically improved specific discharge capacities of up to 925 mA h g(-1) (the areal capacity of the cathode is 4.6 mA h cm(-2)) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) after 50 cycles; they also show good rate performance.

Under the significant effect of OAPS, the PMIA-based GPE acts as a multi-functional separator with exceedingly high electrolyte uptake, exceptional thermal stability and robust mechanical strength. Particularly, the -NH2 groups of OAPS provide an electronegative environment, which facilitate the lithium ions migration while inhibit the negative polysulfide anions transfer. Thus, the PMIA-based GPE exhibits an effective electrostatic shielding effect to restrain lithium polysulfide on cathode side, while vigorously stimulating the transmission of lithium ions. As a great result, the lithium ions migration, the interface impedance and the reversible rate capacity of the assembled lithium-sulfur battery obtain a marked improvement. Meantime, the cell with the PMIA-based separator, adopting conventional sulfur-carbon black as cathode materials, delivers a high initial capacity of 851.1 mAh.g(-1) with capacity retention of 458.3 mAh.g(-1) after 800 cycles at 0.5 C rate, accompanied by a low capacity decay of 0.057% per cycle. Therefore, the prepared PMIA separator imbedding with OAPS can be deemed as an extraordinary potential candidate for the application in high-performance lithium-sulfur cells.

Herein, we report a lithiophilic and sulfiphilic NbN decorated nitrogen-doped graphene (NbN@NG) interlayer on a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator. Due to the lithiophilic features of NbN nanodots effectively hindering the growth of lithium dendrites, the Li//Li symmetric battery with NbN@NG/PP delivers outstanding stability at 5 mA h cm(-2) over 1100 h. Owing to the polar and conductive NbN nanodots with strong interaction and high catalytic conversion towards LiPSs suppressing the shuttling effect, the Li-S battery with NbN@NG/PP delivers a high discharge capacity of 1284 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and excellent high-rate performance at 2C with a negligible capacity fading of 0.036% per cycle over 500 cycles. The Li-S pouch battery with NbN@NG/PP delivers a capacity of 847 mA h g(-1) with a low electrolyte volume/sulfur loading ratio of 6 mu L mg(-1). Theoretical density functional theory and in situ Raman spectroscopy effectively demonstrate the mechanism for LiPSs conversion. This work provides a new design strategy for multifunctional separators and new insights into the performance-enhancement mechanism towards high-performance shuttle-free and dendrite-free Li-S batteries.

Sulfur crystallization in the cathode of lithium-sulfur battery during the charging process: A possible alternative to reduce the shuttle effect	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery charge; Polysulfides oxidation; Electrolyte additive; Polyelectrolyte binder; Shuttle effect	X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; IN-SITU; LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; MECHANISM; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODES; EFFICIENCY; SHELL; LINO3	Most studies on lithium-sulfur batteries have paid attention to eliminating the shuttle effect caused by polysulfides via trapping polysulfides in cathodes. However, the charging process is neglected because the formation of an eight-membered sulfur ring is hindered by the low probability of head-to-tail contact in the long eight-membered chain. However, reducing the polysulfide concentration in an electrolyte can also be a good alternative. In this study, benefiting from electrolyte additives, polysulfide concentration in the electrolyte is reduced by oxidizing soluble polysulfides into insoluble sulfur disposing on surface of graphene during charging. Furthermore, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images of the cathode charged to 3.0 V show that this sulfur crystal transforms from rectangular to regular hexagonal in a single crystal plane, revealing that the most stable crystal type for sulfur in this system is hexagonal and not rhombic. And reducing the shuttle effect by decreasing the density of polysulfides in the electrolyte via sulfur crystallization during charging is a novel and promising method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, the technology readiness level of Li-S batteries increased steadily in recent years due to extensive research, as well as the number of reported prototype cells. However, an often ignored test parameter is the application of external pressure to the cell stack. In this study, the influence of external pressure on the performance of Li-S cells is investigated. Therefore, five-layered pouch cells with solvent-free processed cathodes are assembled. These cells are tested under lean electrolyte conditions (electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 4.5 mu l mg(S)(-1)). To evaluate the influence of the used electrolyte system either the state-of-the-art 1,2-dimethoxyethane/1,3-dioxolane electrolyte or the sparing polysulfide solvating hexyl methyl ether/1,3-dioxolane electrolyte is deployed. The impact of pressure application is evaluated electrochemically as well as by post-mortem focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy of the cycled electrodes. Moreover, a technique for infiltration of sulfur into the carbon host matrix is presented, discussed, and successfully implemented.

Exfoliated-metal carbide (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets have high electronic conductivity and contain rich functional groups for effective trapping of polysulfides. Mesoporous carbon with a robust porous structure provides sufficient spaces for loading sulfur and effectively cushion the volumetric expansion of sulfur cathodes. Theoretical calculations have confirmed that metal carbide can absorb sulfur and polysulfides, therefore extending the cycling performance. The Ti3C2Tx@Meso-C/S cathodes have achieved a high capacity of 1225.8 mAh g(-1) and more than 300 cycles at the C/2 current rate. The Ti3C2Tx@Meso-C hybrid architecture is a promising cathode host material for lithium-sulfur batteries.

The separator modification as a simple and effective technique has been extensively applied in Li-S batteries to solve inherent defects. Herein, the composite of Ketjen black (KB) and Ti4O7 was synthetized by carbothermal reduction and made into KB/Ti4O7-modified separator. The multifunctional layer can improve utilization of active substances and restrain shuttling effect by forming synergistic effect of physical obstruct and chemisorption for polysulides. The cell using KB/Ti4O7 separator exhibits enhanced electrochemical properties reflecting in higher specific capacity (1074 mAh g(-1) at 1C) and longer cycling life (836 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles). The above results indicate that the composite of carbon and metallic oxide modified separator is pretty suitable for advanced Li-S battery.

Here, the ZIF-67 can provide more active sites for sulfur attachment after vacuum treatment. The MnO(2 )coated on the surface of ZIF-67@S was introduced through the redox reaction of KMnO4 under ice bath with high purities, which can also effectively form a sandwich structure to encapsulate the sulfur particles attached to the surface of the MOF. TheMnO(2) can chemically bind polysulfdes strongly and further relieve volume expansion, which might enhance the performance of lithium-sulfur battery. This combination of physical adsorption of ZIF-67 itself and filling of MnO2 can effectively encapsulate sulfur to obtain high specific capacity. When the ZIF-67@S@MnO2 composite is initially discharged, the specific capacity can reach about 1250 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C. In addition, the as-obtained composite exhibits stable specific capacities of 895 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, 686 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and 484 mAh g(-1) at 2 C after 100 cycles, respectively. The encouraging compartment structure and excellent electrochemical performance can be recommended for energy storage applications. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, its practical application is impeded by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides, huge volume expansion, and overgrowth dendrite of lithium. Herein, we propose an artificial conformal agar polymer coating on a lithium anode (marked as A-Li). The functional layer facilitating the formation of a compact interphase on the lithium anode can effectively accommodate expansive volume and restrain the growth of dendritic lithium. The Li/Li symmetric cell with A-Li delivers stable plating/stripping cycling over 300 h at a high current density of 3.0 mA cm(-2) and a high fixed areal capacity of 3.0 mAh cm(-2). The cycle life of Li-Cu cells with A-Li is twice longer than that of pristine cells, and the Li-S batteries equipped with A-Li anodes also deliver an enhanced specific capacity and high Coulombic efficiencies. This work provides a pathway to protect metal Li anodes and contributes to the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, to date, its commercial application was hindered by the inherent problems of sulfur cathode. Additionally, with the rapid decline of non-renewable resources and active appeal of green chemistry, the intensive research of new electrode materials was conducted worldwide. We have obtained a sheet-like carbon material (shaddock peel carbon sheets SPCS) from organic waste shaddock peel, which can be used as the conductive carbon matrix for sulfur-based cathodes. Furthermore, the raw materials are low-cost, truly green and recyclable. As a result, the sulfur cathode made with SPCS (SPCS-S), can deliver a high reversible capacity of 722.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles with capacity recuperability of similar to 90%, demonstrating that the SPCS-S hybrid is of great potential as the cathode for rechargeable Li-S batteries. The high electrochemical performance of SPCS-S hybrid could be attributed to the sheet-like carbon network with large surface area and high conductivity of the SPCS, in which the carbon sheets enable the uniform distribution of sulfur, better ability to trap the soluble polysulfides and accommodate volume expansion/shrinkage of sulfur during repeated charge/discharge cycles.

However, it remains a huge challenge for ASSLSBs to achieve high areal active mass loading and high active material utilization simultaneously due to the insulating nature of sulfur and Li2S, and the large volume change during cycling. Herein, a Li2S@C nanocomposite with Li2S nano-crystals uniformly embedded in conductive carbon matrix, is in situ generated by the combustion of lithium metal with CS2. Benefiting from its unique architecture, the Li2S@C exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance as cathode for ASSLSBs, with both ultrahigh areal Li2S loading (7 mg cm(-2)) and 91% of Li2S utilization (corresponding to a reversible capacity of 1067 mAh g(-1)). Moreover, the Li2S@C also possesses outstanding rate capability and cycling stability. High reversible capacity of 644 mAh g(-1) is delivered at 2 mA cm(-2) even after 700 cycles. This work demonstrates that ASSLSBs with superior electrochemical performance can be realized via rational design of the cathode structure, which provides a promising prospect to the development of ASSLSBs with practical energy density surpassing that of lithium ion batteries.

However, the Li dendrite growth from the anode and the "polysulfide shuttle" from the cathode may cause poor cycling performance and safety concerns, hindering the practicality of Li-S batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a novel separator design by coating three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanofiber (CNF) interlayers on both sides of the separator to achieve a high performance Li-S battery. The CNF interlayer can not only render a uniform Li deposition on the anode by eliminating the "tip effect", but also restrain the polysulfide diffusion on the cathode with its porous and highly conductive 3D architecture, enhancing the utilization of S-related species significantly. So an average Coulombic efficiency of the Li metal anode protected by a CNF interlayer is up to 95% for 100 cycles at 0.5 mA cm(-2). Moreover, Li-S batteries with CNF interlayers can exhibit remarkable cycle performance, presenting an initial specific capacity of 1207.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and retaining at 828.1 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. In addition, the low-cost raw materials and the simple preparation for CNF interlayers is suitable for industrial scale-up. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The materials were characterized by XRD, SAXS, SEM, TEM, Raman, EA, BET, CV and RRDE. The results showed that FDU16-PEI/S exhibited the largest initial discharge capacity of 1266 mAg g-1 at 0.1C and presented a lower capacity fading rate of 0.26% per cycle for the 100 cycles in comparison with the capacity fading rate of FDU16/S (0.41%), FDU16-EDA/S (0.31%) and FDU16-TEPA/S (0.29%). During the RRDE experiments, all samples revealed similar RRDE profiles in all disk voltage (DV) regions, suggesting they resemble the dissolution behavior of the LiPS intermediates during the cycling process. The FDU16-PEI/S owned a smaller slope value of ring current change in the DV II region, indicating a lower dissolution of LiPS intermediates from the sulfur electrode. The order of LiPS adsorption efficiency was shown to be PEI > TEPA > EDA. This study demonstrated carbon materials functionalized with large amine groups provide strong affinities with LiPS intermediates, resulting in notably improving cycle performance in Li-S batteries.

Enhancing the conductivity of the sulfur cathode and moderating the dissolution of lithium polysulfides are two key factors for the success of lithium-sulfur batteries. Here we report a sulfur host that overcomes both obstacles at once. With inherent metallic conductivity and strong adsorption capability for lithium-polysulfides, titanium monoxide@carbon hollow nanospheres can not only generate sufficient electrical contact to the insulating sulfur for high capacity, but also effectively confine lithium-polysulfides for prolonged cycle life. Additionally, the designed composite cathode further maximizes the lithium-polysulfide restriction capability by using the polar shells to prevent their outward diffusion, which avoids the need for chemically bonding all lithium-polysulfides on the surfaces of polar particles.

However, gas evolution induced by spontaneous decomposition of organic electrolytes during cell cycling leads to the capacity decay and safety issues of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, the gas evolution behavior in a working Li-sulfur (Li-S) battery based on the most widely used 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)/1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolyte was probed through gas phase chromatography, mass spectrum of as-produced gas in pouch cells, as well as the first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics. An adsorption-to-reaction mechanism that DOL/DME firstly adsorbed lithium and then decomposed was proposed and verified. DOL with a small decomposition barrier was found to be easily decomposed into ethylene. When the DME: DOL ratio in the organic of Li-S cell was increased, a high and long discharge plateau as well as a large discharge capacity were observed. We also protected Li metal anode to avoid the direct contact between electrolyte and fresh Li metal through the polysulfide additives. The as obtained cell afforded few gas evolution and consequently a long cycling life. This understanding sheds fresh light of ultra-long cycling life of Li-S pouch cell from the viewpoint of stable electrolyte based on theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, which can be extended to other LMBs based on multi-electron redox reactions.

The oriented-macroporous-carbon (OMC) incorporated with gamma-Al2O3 is prepared through pyrolysis of a glucose-urea-resin-filled MOF MIL-53 with double templates of NaCl-KCl eutectic and nano-CaCO3. The glucose-urea resin and NaCl-KCl eutectic fill the tunnels in the MIL-53 to avoid tunnel collapse and combination during pyrolysis. The nano-CaCO3 stays out of the tunnels to prevent from forming sealed tunnels. The synthesized OMC exhibits excellent polysulfide absorption capability, ascribed to its ultrahigh specific surface area and the coexistence of active O and N sites for polysulfide absorption.

High interface resistance of the electrodes and poor ion conductivity of solid-state electrolytes are two main challenges for solid-state batteries, which require operation at elevated temperatures of 60-90 degrees C. Herein; we report the facile synthesis of Al3+/Nb5+ codoped Cubit Li2La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) nanoparticles and LLZO nano particle decorated porous carbon foam (LLZO@C) by the onestep Pechini sol-gel method. The. LLZO nanoparticle-filled poly(ethylene oxide) electrolyte shows Unproved conductivity compared with filler-free samples. The sulfur composite cathode based on LLZO@C can deliver an attractive specific capacity of >900 mAh g(-1) at the human body teniperature 37 degrees C and a high capacity of 1210 and 1556 mAh g(-1) at 50 and 70 degrees C, respectively. In addition, the solid-state Li-S batteries exhibit high Coulombic efficiency and show remarkably Stable cycling performance.

Tuning Transition Metal Oxide-Sulfur Interactions for Long Life Lithium Sulfur Batteries: The "Goldilocks" Principle	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						Li-S batteries; polythionate; redox potential; sulfur hosts; transition metal oxides	NICKEL PEROXIDE; ION BATTERIES; VANADIUM-OXIDES; CYCLE-LIFE; CATHODES; GRAPHENE; SURFACE; POLYSULFIDES; DEPOSITION; REDUCTION	The lithium-sulfur battery is a compelling energy storage system because its high theoretical energy density exceeds Li-ion batteries at much lower cost, but applications are thwarted by capacity decay caused by the polysulfide shuttle. Here, proof of concept and the critical metrics of a strategy to entrap polysulfides within the sulfur cathode by their reaction to form a surface-bound active redox mediator are demonstrated. It is shown through a combination of surface spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry studies that only materials with redox potentials in a targeted window react with polysulfides to form active surface-bound polythionate species. These species are directly correlated to superior Li-S cell performance by electrochemical studies of high surface area oxide cathodes with redox potentials below, above, and within this window. Optimized Li-S cells yield a very low fade rate of 0.048% per cycle. The insight gained into the fundamental surface mechanism and its correlation to the stability of the electrochemical cell provides a bridge between mechanistic understanding and battery performance essential for the design of high performance Li-S cells.

Fe-carbon hybrid composite interlayer for improved electrochemical performance of Li-S battery	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Fe-carbon interlayer; Density functional theory; Catalytic graphitization; Carbon xerogel; Li-polysulfides; Li-S battery	MOLECULAR-ORBITAL METHODS; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; SELF-DISCHARGE; BASIS-SETS; CATHODE; SHUTTLE; SHELL	The major bottlenecks in achieving the full potential of Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are the insulating nature of sulfur and Li-polysulfide (Li-PS) shuttling which lead to their poor rate performance and cyclic stability. In this work, we solve these critical issues using a unique Fe-carbon hybrid composite inter layer prepared by the catalytic graphitization of resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) xerogel. The physicochemical characterizations of the interlayer material reveal that it consists of iron-nanoparticles encapsulated by graphitic carbon within the amorphous RF xerogel derived hard carbon matrix (Fe-G-HC-IL). The Li-S battery, with Fe-G-HC-IL as a functional separator and activated candle soot-sulfur composite cathode, demonstrates a significantly improved electrochemical performance than without the interlayer. The Li-S battery with Fe-G-HC-IL shows the capacity of 1057 mAh g(-1) at 1 C-rate with a decay rate of 0.055% per cycle and excellent rate capability. Further, density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates that the Fe embedded carbon structure present in interlayer composite contributes significantly to the improvement in the conductivity and minimization of Li-PS shuttling. Additionally, this Fe-carbon hybrid structure electro catalyzes the conversion of Li-PS to desired end products of the redox reactions which further enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

To reduce the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte and prolong the cycling stability, nanoparticle-stacked metal nitride derived from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as an interlayer was inserted between sulfur cathode and separator to confine polysulfides by physical and chemical interactions. Meanwhile, the surface of metal nitride will form an oxide passivation layer. The passivation layer possesses hydrophilic metal-O group and provides a polar surface for strong binding with polysulfide. What's more, the nanoparticles-stacked structure could immerge and retain electrolyte well, which could enhance the ability of promoting the electron exchange rate. The sulfur electrode with nanoparticle-stacked metal nitride interlayer has an excellent cycle performance owing to the interactions between metal nitride and polysulfides. The battery delivered an initial capacity of 764.6 mAh g(-1) and still possesses a capacity of 477.5 mAh g(-1) with the retention of 62.4% after 800 cycles. (C) 2017 Science China Press.

By this template-free method, MCSs with different porosity are deduced by manipulating the volume ratio of ethanol in the solvent for chitosan. The resulted MCSs show controllable surface areas, pore volumes and bimodal pore size distribution. They are employed as substrates for the preparation of sulfur/carbon composite cathode. Electrochemical performance of the MCSs with 50 wt% sulfur loading is investigated. One of the S/MCS composite cathodes displays initial discharge capacity of 1163 mAhg(-1), excellent rate capability of 510 mAhg(-1) at 2 C and good cycling stability of 715 inAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. The sulfur loading content could reach as high as 60%, while it still could deliver a capacity of 642 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.

Effective lithium polysulfide (LiPS) capturing is enabled by the lithiophilic N-containing phthalocyanine rings and the sulfiphilic Co central atoms. This adsorption geometry utilizes the Co unoccupied d-orbitals as electron super-exchange highways. Elevated kinetics of LiPSs reactions in the liquid phase as well as liquid-solid transitions were revealed by electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations. Uniform deposition of Li2S films was also observed, which preserves cathode integrity and sulfur utilization during cell cycling. The catalyzed sulfur redox is also significantly facilitated by the fast electron and Li-ion transport to and from the reaction sites through the conductive MWCNT skeletons and the lithiophilic substituent amino groups on TaPcCo. With 6 wt % addition of TaPcCo-MWCNT in the cathode coatings, high sulfur utilization is achieved with areal sulfur loadings of up to 7 mg cm(-2). Stable long-term cycling is achieved at 1 C at a sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2), with an initial areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm(-2) retention of 3.5 mAh cm(-2) after 500 cycles. Considering the high structural diversity of phthalocyanines macromolecules, this study provides opportunities for a new class of Li-S catalysts.

Recent advances in the cathode materials and solid-state electrolytes for lithium sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HIGH-ENTROPY-ALLOY; LI-S BATTERIES; CARBON MATERIALS; STABILITY	Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have sparked a lot of attention due to their high theoretical energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, several challenges, notably unstable cycle life and low sulfur consumption, have hampered the development of workable LSBs for commercial use. Most of these challenges arise from the cathode materials and liquid electrolytes. This mini-review attempts to highlight the current advancements in cathode materials and solid-state electrolytes for the development of next-generation LSBs.

However, the majority of substrates with both high electronic conductivity and full coverage of adsorption-catalysis synergy are difficult to achieve. Herein, nitrogen functionalized porous carbon nanofibers assembled with nickel ferrite nanoparticles (NFO/NCFs) are successfully prepared by electrospinning combined with hydrothermal treatment, which were applied to current collector containing Li2S6 catholyte and binder-free for Li-S batteries. With its abundant active sites, the NFO/NCFs have a vital role in the adsorption and catalysis of the polysulfides, which further accelerate the redox kinetics. Consequently, Li2S6 catholyte impregnated NFO/NCFs electrode (sulfur loading: 5.09 mg cm(-2)) exhibits the first discharge capacity of 997 mAh g(-1) and maintains at 637 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles at 0.2C, which is superior cycling performance than NCFs. Even at 10.2 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading, the composite electrode shows a high area capacity of 8.35 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1C and retains 6.01 mAh cm(-2) after 150 cycles. The results suggest the multifunction NFO/NCFs that anchor effectively and catalysis are beneficial to realize the goal of the large-scale application for Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The MoS2-MoO3 heterostructures can conform to the CS morphology, forming two-dimensional nanosheets, and thus shorten the transport path of lithium ion and electrons. Based on our theoretical calculations and experiments, the heterostructures show strong surface affinity toward polysulfides and good catalytic activity to accelerate polysulfide conversion. Benefiting from the above merits, the Li-S battery with a MoS2-MoO3/CS modified separator exhibits good electrochemical performance: it delivers a high discharge capacity of 1531 mAh g (-1)at 0.2 C; the initial capacity can be maintained by 92% after 600 cycles at 1 C, and the discharge capacity decay rate is only 0.0135% per cycle. Moreover, the MoS2-MoO3/CS battery still achieves good cycling stability with 78% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.2 C with a high sulfur loading of 5.9 mg cm(-2). This work offers a facile design to construct the MoS2-MoO3 heterostructures for high-performance Li-S batteries, and may also improve one's understanding on the heterostructure contribution during polysulfide adsorption and conversion.

In this work, we report the synthesis of trace iron-decorated nitrogen/sulfur co-doped hierarchically porous carbon through pyrolysis of a polymer network with impregnated silica nanoparticles, zinc acetate, and ferric nitrate, followed by the removal of templates and isolated iron particles. Both micropores and mesopores exist in the thus-synthesized materials with a specific surface area of 1055 m(2) g(-1). The synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits a promising electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reactions under both alkaline and acidic conditions as evidenced by half-wave potentials and limiting current density. The half-wave potential of the synthesized material is about 44 mV higher and about 60 mV lower than that of Pt/C under alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Moreover, the synthesized material is more electrochemically stable than the commercial Pt/C under both alkaline and acidic conditions. In addition, the synthesized material displays a capacity of 1130 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C as a sulfur host in a Li-S battery, and the capacity decay is 0.114% per cycle at 1.0 C over 400 cycles.

In this study, a novel ZIF-7@carbon composite with ZIF-7 sheets vertically rooted on carbon cloth was developed as multifunctional interlayer to address these issues. The composite shows directional layered structure with outstanding compactness, and thus can provide massive active sites for accelerated redox reactions. The pore channels are perpendicular to the square surface, resulting in extremely high utilization of one-dimensional channels. Therefore, this structure can not only maintain the structural stability during the charge-discharge process by providing enough space for volume expansion, but also contribute to efficient exposure and utilization of active sites for the physical/chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfide. As a result, Li-S batteries with the as-developed interlayer deliver a considerable areal capacity of 4.75 mAh cm(-2) at an elevated sulfur loading of 5.5 mg cm(-2), and an impressive cyclability with an extremely low capacity-fading rate of merely 0.04% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C.

AbstractAs promising energy storage systems, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted significant attention because of their ultra-high energy densities. However, Li-S battery suffers problems related to the complex phase conversion that occurs during the charge-discharge process, particularly the deposition of solid Li2S from the liquid-phase polysulfides, which greatly limits its practical application. In this paper, edge-rich MoS2/C hollow microspheres (Edg-MoS2/C HMs) were designed and used to functionalize separator for Li-S battery, resulting in the uniform deposition of Li2S. The microspheres were fabricated through the facile hydrothermal treatment of MoO3-aniline nanowires and a subsequent carbonization process. The obtained Edg-MoS2/C HMs have a strong chemical absorption capability and high density of Li2S binding sites, and exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance and can effectively hinder the polysulfide shuttle effect and guide the uniform nucleation and growth of Li2S. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Edg-MoS2/C HMs can effectively regulate the deposition of Li2S and significantly improve the reversibility of the phase conversion of the active sulfur species, especially at high sulfur loadings and high C-rates. As a result, a cell containing a separator functionalized with Edg-MoS2/C HMs exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 935mAhg(-1) at 1.0C and maintained a capacity of 494mAhg(-1) after 1000 cycles with a sulfur loading of 1.7mgcm(-2). Impressively, at a high sulfur loading of 6.1mgcm(-2) and high rate of 0.5C, the cell still delivered a high reversible discharge capacity of 478mAhg(-1) after 300 cycles. This work provides fresh insights into energy storage systems related to complex phase conversions.

However, it is also blamed for diminishing the volumetric energy density and being susceptible to side reactions. Herein, polyethylenimine intercalated graphite oxide (PEI-GO) with a low SSA of 4.6 m(2) g(-1) and enlarged interlayer spacing of 13 angstrom is proposed as a superior sulfur host, which enables homogeneous distribution of high sulfur content (73%) and facilitates Li+ transfer in thick sulfur electrode. LSBs with a moderate sulfur loading (3.4 mg S cm(-2)) achieve an initial capacity of 1157 and 668 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. Even when the sulfur loading is increased to 7.3 mg cm(-2), the electrode still delivers a high areal capacity of 4.7 mAh cm(-2) (641 mAh g(-1)) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. The excellent electrochemical properties of PEI-GO are mainly attributed to the homogeneous distribution of sulfur in PEI-GO and the strong chemical interactions between polysulfides and amine groups, which can mitigate the loss of active phases and contribute to the better cycling stability.

Activated carbon and sulfur were agitated in CS2-modified scCO2 at 100 degrees C and 150 bar for 3 h. The appreciable densities and solvent power, combined with low viscosity, low surface tension and high diffusivity of scCO2, facilitated highly dispersed impregnation of high loading percentage of sulfur into porous structure of activated carbon whilst enabling excellent electrical contact. Lab Li-S battery test showed that after 150 cycles under current density of 0.5 C, the resultant carbon-sulfur composite exhibited a capacity retention of similar to 60%, higher than that of similar to 45% for the counterpart prepared by melting infiltration.

However, they suffer from the loss of active material, insulating nature of sulfur, degradation of the lithium anode and fast capacity fading due to polysulfide shuttling. In this work, a novel approach has been made to improve the performance of the Li-S battery by using functional separators that are modified using a plasma technique. The plasma-modified functional separator is made by firstly irradiating a polymer separator with a plasma, secondly followed by coating it with a thin carbon layer which is then thirdly subjected to an additional plasma treatment to modify the carbon layer. The plasma treatment generates various functional groups on the surfaces of the polymer separator and the carbon layer. The plasma-modified functional separator is found to provide more wettability, electric conduction paths and active sites that could facilitate the redox reactions and lithium ion transport as well as reduce the polysulfide shuttling, ultimately leading to a dramatic improvement in the performance of the Li-S battery. Among various plasma gases tested, such as CO2, N-2 and O-2, the CO2 plasma is found to be the most effective in improving the electrochemical properties of the functional separators. The polysulfide permeation rate through the CO2-plasma-modified functional separator is reduced by about 70 times and the Li-S battery employing the functional separator displays an initial capacity of 1204 mA h g(-1) and a remaining capacity of 802 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C rate, which account for 57% and 61% increments, respectively, as compared with those of the cell using a pristine separator. In-depth physicochemical and electrochemical analyses have also been carried out to characterize the modified separators and carbon layers and to interpret the reasons for the improved performance of the Li-S batteries employing the functional separators. Accordingly, these functional separators modified with plasma are confirmed to be very promising for the development of high performance Li-S batteries.

Within this method, the 3D nanoporous carbonaceous framework is obtained by a one-step carbonization of sodium citrate. The ultrafine VN nanoparticles with typical size of 5-10 nm are prepared by a common condition of 700 degrees C heat-treatment under flowing N-2, and they are uniformly dispersed in the pores of carbon skeleton, as shown in the TEM images. The VN nanoparticles here play important roles of enhancing electronic conductivity, anchoring polysulfides and catalyzing reaction reversion. At a rate of 1C, the 3DNPC/VN-S cathode exhibits a discharge specific capacity of 734 mAh g(-1) for the initial cycle and a reversible capacity of 615 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles, achieving a high capacity retention rate of 83.8%. Even at a high rate of 8 C, the discharge capacity of the 3DNPC/VN-S cathode can still reach 687 mAh g(-1), indicating an excellent rate performance. Therefore, this novel strategy is effective on designing a high-performance lithium-sulfur battery. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, the active tin dioxide nano-octahedra enclosed by {332} crystal facets (SnO2 {332}) are synthesized on reduced graphene oxide and demonstrate powerful chemisorption and catalytic ability, accelerating the redox kinetics of sulfur species in lithium-sulfur chemistry. Attributed to abundant unsaturated-coordinated Sn sites on {332} crystal planes, SnO2 {332} has outstanding adsorption and catalytic properties. The material not only adsorbs and converts polysulfides efficiently, but also prominently lowers the decomposition energy barrier of Li2S. The batteries with these high active electrocatalysts exhibit excellent cycling stability with a low capacity attenuation of 0.021% every cycle during 2000 cycles at 2 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 8.12 mg cm(-2), the batteries can still cycle stably and maintain a prominent areal capacity of 6.93 mAh cm(-2) over 100 cycles. This research confirms that crystal facet engineering is a promising strategy to optimize the performance of catalysts, deepens the understanding of surface structure-oriented electrocatalysis in Li-S chemistry, while aiding the rational design of advanced sulfur electrodes.

Here we systematically investigate the electrochemical performance of a series of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) for Li-S batteries. All TMNs we investigated were found to have much stronger binding strength with polysulfide intermediates than graphene and transition metal sulfides (TMSs), indicating good performance of sulfur immobilization. These TMNs can also facilitate the lithium diffusion and activate the decomposition of Li2S, suggesting the good rate performance, high reversible capacity, and long cycling life of Li-S batteries. We also demonstrated that, among the TMNs, VN exhibits great potential as the anchoring materials in Li-S batteries with enhanced electrochemical performance. Our results provide a rational strategy to design and screen the materials to achieve high performance of Li-S batteries.

The combination with impedance spectroscopy yields valuable insights into the precipitation and dissolution of lithium sulfide during 10 cycles of galvanostatic cycling. The use of a deuterated electrolyte increases strongly the sensitivity to detect the sulfur and Li2S precipitates at the carbon host electrode and allows us to observe the time-dependent initial wetting of the system. No correlation of the scattering signal of the micropores with either lithium sulfide or sulfur is observable during the whole course of the experiment. Hence both reaction products do not precipitate inside the microporous structure but on the outer surface of the micrometer-sized carbon fibers used in this study. The excellent scattering contrast allows a detailed analysis of the formation and dissolution process of nanoscopic Li2S structures. While lithium sulfide particles grow homogeneously during the precipitation period, smaller Li2S particles dissolve first followed by a sudden dissolution of the larger Li2S particles.

It is found that the NC@FCF membrane is composed of interlaced and circuitous carbon fibers, and the carbon spheres are distributed in the interspaces among carbon fibers. After infiltration with sulfur, the S-NC@FCF membrane was directly used as a cathode for Li-S batteries. The freestanding cathode exhibits an excellent rate capability, large charge-discharge capacity, and outstanding cycle performance, exhibiting an initial discharge capacity of 1143.7mAhg(-1) and maintaining 778.2mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C. The excellent electrochemical performance results from the synergistic effect of the 3D carbon-fiber network, which provides electronic conduction pathways, and the porous structure formed through the accumulation of carbon spheres, which can encapsulate S, absorb polysulfides, and facilitate Li+ transfer.

Here, an advanced graphene nanocage structure with the capability of hosting both cyclo-S-8 and smaller sulfur molecules (S2-4) is reported. The cage inner cavity is partially filled with S-8 to form a yolk-shell structure that enables free volumetric variation of S-8 during (de)lithiation. In the graphene shell of the cage, S-8 are downsized to S2-4 to activate extra sulfur loading sites within graphene layers. Importantly, the graphene shell exhibits inward volumetric variation upon (de)lithiation of the loaded S2-4, and the overall electrode strain is thus minimized. This prototyped design promises an ultimate solution to maximize sulfur loading in carbon matrices as well as to circumvent the polysulfide dissolution problem and boost the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries in the future.

With the Co-N-C composite as a sulfur host, the initial capacity of lithium-sulfur batteries is as high as 1290.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, and Li-S batteries still exhibit good cycling stability and high capacity with a retained capacity of 795.7 mA h g(-1) and a nearly 100% coulombic efficiency after 300 cycles. The good performance of Li-S batteries can be attributed to a higher specific surface area and pore volume of the carbon matrix and good chemical affinity of Co and N elements toward polysulfides. It is found that Co-N-C composite can effectively adsorb lithium polysulfide by physical, chemical adsorption and well inhibit the shuttle effect. In addition, Co-N-C composite which act as a catalyst can also significantly promote the conversion of polysulfide, accelerate the kinetics, thereby improving the performance of Li-S batteries.

In order to address some drawbacks of the LSBs, here, sulfur was encapsulated by carbon black nanospheres (CN) and oxidized carbon nanosheet (OCN) with a sheet-like morphology by a mechanofusion and a colloidal coating techniques, respectively. Core-double shell S@CN@OCN composites were used as the cathode materials for Li-S batteries. The first CN shell can reduce the volume expansion of the sulfur during the charging process and also enhance the electrical conductivity. The second OCN shell can accommodate the volume expansion of the sulfur and decrease the "redox shuttle effect". The LSB using the core-double shell S@CN@OCN cathode can provide the first and second discharge specific capacities of 1,313 and 1,279 mAh g(1) at 0.1C, respectively. In addition, the stability of this LIB tested at 1C over 400 cycles provides 77% capacity retention and 98% coulombic efficiency. This newly designed core-double shell S@CN@OCN structure may be the promising cathode of LSBs leading to the practical applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Targeting this critical challenge, we develop an advanced polysulfide barrier by modifying the conventional separator with CNTs-interspersed V2C/V2O5 nanosheets to alleviate the shuttle effect. The partial oxidization of V2C MXene constructs the V2C/V2O5 composite with V2O5 nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on few-layered V2C nanosheets, which synergistically and concurrently improves the sulfur confinement and redox reaction kinetics. Moreover, the interstacking between the 1D CNTs and the 2D V2C/V2O5 not only prevents the agglomeration of nanosheets for efficient exposure of active interfaces but also constructs a robust conductive network for fast charge and mass transfers. The Li-S cells with V2C/V2O5/CNTs-modified separator realize a high initial capacity (1240.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), decent capacity retention (82.6% over 500 cycles), and favorable areal capacity (5.9 mAh cm(-2)) at a raised sulfur loading (6.0 mg cm(-2)). This work affords a unique multifunctional separator design toward durable and efficient sulfur electrochemistry, holding great promise for improving the electrochemical properties of Li-S batteries.

However, this task turns out extremely challenging due to the lack of scalable production of rationally designed sulfur-rich particles, as well as fundamental understanding of the main issues of thick electrodes. Here, we develop a hail-inspired sulfur nanostorm (HSN) technology to efficiently produce calendering-compatible sulfur-rich secondary particles with customizable composition and material functions. To dig out the fundamental links between sulfur-rich particles properties and their electrochemical performance, an electro-mechanical method is proposed to evaluate the sulfur-rich particles properties (calendering-compatibility and conductivity). Meanwhile, the role of active material calendering-compatibility in controlling its electrochemical performance is discussed by a "healthy" microenvironment model as learned from cell biology. Consequently, a high areal capacity of 12 mAh cm(-2) @ 1 mA cm(-2) is realized in coin-cell. Furthermore, a pouch cell with a high specific capacitance of 1294 mAh g(-1) in a quasi-lean electrolyte is successfully demonstrated. In a nutshell, this study may provide guidelines for the design, fabrication and characterization of high-quality of thick sulfur cathode for Li-S batteries.

Constructing an interlayer is an efficient way to block the LiPS shuttling, but maintaining a low Li ion diffusion resistance with such an interlayer is hard to achieve. Herein, a thin porous carbon nanosheet embedded with TiO(2)nanoparticles (denoted PCNS-TiO2) was used to fabricate an interlayer on the separator, which effectively solves the above problem. The PCNS-TiO(2)was prepared by using the Ti(3)C(2)T(x)MXene as the two-dimensional (2D) template directing the porous carbon sheet formation, and the Ti(3)C(2)T(x)transformed into TiO(2)nanoparticles embedded in the PCNS. The decomposition of the MXene eliminates the ion blocking effect by the 2D nanosheet structure. The thin and hierarchical porous structure allows fast Li ion diffusion across the interlayer, and at the same time, the porous structure and the strong adsorption ability of TiO(2)effectively block the polysulfide diffusion. Thus, the Li-S battery with this interlayer shows good rate performance with a high capacity of 627 mA h g(-1)at 2 C. Meanwhile, stable cycling performance is also achieved, showing a low capacity decay of 0.063% per cycle after 300 cycles at 0.5 C.

The severe "shuttle effect" during the charge/discharge cycle causes significant performance degradation, and has become a great challenge for the practical application of rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries. The biological reductant dithiothreitol (DTT) in the interlayer of lithium-sulfur batteries could reduce the shuttle effect by chemically cutting the polysulfide. The biocatalysts of molecular scission provide a gentle and innovative way to address the problems in lithiumsulfur batteries. Understanding the specific working principle of DTT would serve to expand the application of reducing agents in lithium-sulfur battery systems. A systematic theoretical study has been performed on the DTT-assisted polysulfide reduction. The steps for DTT to reduce the polysulfide chains, including the intermediate product of each reduction step (i.e. cleavage site of polysulfides) were clarified. The difference between the reduction of long chain and short chain polysulfides and the modification method of DTT to promote the reduction kinetics were also unraveled. It is hoped that our study could provide mechanistic insights into the DTT promoted performance of Li-S batteries and give inspiration for biological reagent expansion.

Contribution to the understanding of the performance differences between commercial current collectors in Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Current collector; Carbon paper; Aluminum foil; Lithium-sulfur battery	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; POLYSULFIDE CONVERSION; GRAPHENE; EFFICIENCY; ACTIVATION; CHEMISTRY; PROGRESS; REDOX	Lithium-sulfur batteries have been recognised as highly promising next-generation batteries, due to their low cost and high theoretical energy density. Despite numerous advances in this technology over the last decade, its commercialisation is still a challenge that has not yet been achieved. Many efforts have been made to improve the problems that these batteries present, mainly by investigating different cathode manufacturing strategies, testing novel Li anodes, new additives in the electrolytes, and modified separators or interlayers. However, the characteristics of the current collectors used in the preparation of the electrodes have been rarely addressed. Three commercial collectors are commonly used in basic research on Li-S batteries: Al foil, carbon coated Al foil (Al-C), and carbon paper (gas diffusion layer, GDL). In this work, a detailed study of the electrochemical response of these commercial collectors has been carried out. The tests were carried out on two S composites formed by carbons of a different natures, commercial carbon black and synthetic N-doped graphene. In addition, the S impregnation method was different, using either melt diffusion at 155 degrees C or ethylenediamine as S solvent, respectively. In both systems, the results were similar-the electrodes supported on GDL delivered higher specific capacities than those supported on Al and Al-C, with minimal differences between the two. Of the different collector properties examined to explain this behaviour, namely Al corrosion, electrical conductivities, surface level composition, and surface texture, only the latter had a significant effect in the performance of GDL-based electrodes. SEM images revealed a rough and cracked surface formed by the agglomerated carbon particles that give rise to a complex pore system, predominantly consisting of macropores. All of these features are beneficial for a better anchoring of the active material on the collector surface, in addition to enhancing the wettability of the electrolyte and favouring reaction kinetics. In contrast, the Al-based collector possesses a very smooth and non-porous surface, detrimental to both the active material-substrate interface and the active material impregnation by the electrolyte.

Thermal treatment at 300 degrees C plays an important role in the sulfur encapsulation process. With 20 h of heating time, a portion of sulfur remained on the surface of carbon, whereas with 60 h of heating time, sulfur is confined deeply in the small pores of carbon that cannot be fully exploited in the redox reaction, thus causing low capacity. The S/CMK-3 composite with thermal treatment for 40 h at 300 degrees C contained 51.3 wt.% sulfur and delivered a high initial capacity of 1375 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C. Moreover, it showed good capacity retention of 704 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and 578 mA h g(-1) at 2 C even after 100 cycles, which proves its potential as a cathode material for high capability lithium sulfur batteries.

Here we report a flexible and high-energy lithium-sulfur full battery device with only 100% oversized lithium, enabled by rationally designed copper-coated and nickel-coated carbon fabrics as excellent hosts for lithium and sulfur, respectively. These metallic carbon fabrics endow mechanical flexibility, reduce local current density of the electrodes, and, more importantly, significantly stabilize the electrode materials to reach remarkable Coulombic efficiency of >99.89% for a lithium anode and >99.82% for a sulfur cathode over 400 half-cell charge-discharge cycles. Consequently, the assembled lithium-sulfur full battery provides high areal capacity (3 mA h cm(-2)), high cell energy density (288 W h kg(-1) and 360 W h L-1), excellent cycling stability (260 cycles), and remarkable bending stability at a small radius of curvature (<1 mm).

Here we report design and synthesis of hierarchical porous g-C3N4/reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) as light-weight sulfur host material for Li-S batteries via a poly-condensation method using silica nanoparticles as hard templates. Microstructure of the g-C3N4/r-GO architecture has been characterized. Electrochemical evaluations indicate that the g-C3N4/r-GO/S composite cathode with 75 wt% of sulfur and moderate macropore density in the host material displays the best Li-storage properties. The reversible capacity reaches 589.6 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current rate of 2 C (3.35 A g(-1)). Especially the rate capability is excellent. Even at 3.5 C, the reversible capacity can reach 55% of the capacity at 0.2 C. This light-weight g-C3N4/r-GO architecture composed of electrical conductive r-GO layers, polar g-C3N4, and hierarchical pores is a promising sulfur host material for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The as-prepared S@TiO2/Ti2C composites exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance. The initial discharge specific capacity was 1408.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C with a high sulfur content of 78.4 wt.%. At a high current rate of 2C and 5C, the batteries still maintained a capacity up to 464.0 and 227.3 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, respectively. The enhanced electrochemical properties of S@TiO2/Ti2C composites was attributed mainly to the synergistic effect between the encapsulation and adsorption of TiO2 for active sulfur, and the conductivity and relieving the volumetric expansion of Ti2C for cathode materials. This structure strategy was an attractive route for restraining the shuttle effect and improving the rate capability of sulfur cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy characterizations have confirmed that this method can produce a homogeneous sulfur coating on the graphene surface and prevent the graphene sheets from aggregation simultaneously to form a three dimensional carbon network. When tested as a cathode in lithium sulfur batteries, the hybrid material exhibits a high discharge capacity and good cycling stability at a current density of 1A/g, even as the sulfur content reaches an extremely high level (75.2% wt). Its excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the stable carbon skeleton formed by the monolayer graphene sheets and the good contact between sulfur and graphene.

However, practical application of Li-S batteries suffers from low rechargeability, poor rate capability and cycling instability of sulfur cathode, which can be mainly ascribed to the poor conductivity of sulfur and the dissolution of the intermediate polysulfides generated during discharge-charge cycles. In this work, a Nafion/super P-modified dual functional separator is designed to improve the long-term cycle stability and rate capability of the pure sulfur cathode. The electrostatic repulsion between the SO3 groups and the dissolved negative S-n(2) ions, and the trap and reutilizing effect of super P for polysulfides, provide double insurance to confine the polysulfides within the cathode side, leading to great improvement in both reversible capacity and cycling stability of the sulfur cathode as compared to the battery with pristine Celgard separator. With such dual functional separator, a simple elemental sulfur cathode with 70% S content delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1087 mAh g (1) at 0.1C and a long-term cyclability with only 0.22% capacity fade per cycle over 250 cycles at 0.5C.

The effects of activation temperature on the textural properties of the pig bone based carbons were investigated. The hierarchical porous carbons exhibit the largest BET specific surface areas and pore volume when the activation temperature reaches 850 degrees C, and the carbon still maintains a highly hierarchical structure even when the temperature is up to 950 degrees C. The pig bone derived hierarchical porous carbon/sulfur composites have been tested as a novel cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. The result shows that the cycle stability and the utilization of sulfur in the lithium-sulfur batteries have been largely improved. The hierarchical porous carbon/sulfur cathode has a high initial capacity of 1265 mAh g(-1) and 643 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, which is higher than that of the normal cathodes with compact structures.

The composite cathode was made from active sulfur (or lithium sulfide), carbon black, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), LiClO4, and acetonitrile. And the polymer electrolyte (PE) was made of gel-type linear PEO with tetra(ethylene glycol dimethyl ether). The open circuit voltage (OCV) of the Li-S battery was about 2.5 V. The Li-S battery showed two reduction peaks and one oxidation peak, which correspond to those of the cell made of lithium sulfide as active material and it had an irreversible kinetic mechanism, which was supported by the charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments as a function of current load and sweep rate. When iron (Fe) powder was added to the composite cathode, its effect on the electrochemical property of the cell was investigated. This cell showed higher specific capacity and longer cycle life than the Li-S battery, and several possible explanations for the effect of Fe in Li-S battery has been presented.

The excellent electronic conductivity of the porous MXene debris, and the good mechanical strength, superior thermal stability as well as large electrolyte infiltration of ESM make MXene/ESM an ideal separator for high-performance Li-S batteries. The strong chemisorption induced from both Ti-S bond formed between Ti atom in MXene and the lithium polysulfides by the Lewis acid-base interaction and affinity of O and N containing functional groups on ESM to the lithium polysulfides greatly prevents the shuttling effect of the polysulfides. Compared with a commercial polypropylene separator, the Li-S battery with the MXene/ESM separator containing a KJC/S cathode and a Li metal anode displays greatly improved cycling stability with a capacity retention of 74% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C, while the Li-S battery with a polypropylene separator remains only 11%. The rate performance of Li-S battery with the MXene/ESM separator has also been enhanced compared to that with a polypropylene separator. Specifically, the Li-S battery with the MXene/ESM separator has a discharge capacity of 1321 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, 1112 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, 1003 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and 948 mAh g(-1) at 1 C.

Nevertheless, further application has been hindered by rapid capacity attenuation largely result from the shuttle effect caused by intermediate polysulfides diffusion. Appropriate binders can play a crucial part of anchoring the lithium polysulfides in sulfur cathode through robust chemical bonds hence enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we explored a new type of binder (chloroprene rubber) that double bond is designed in the binder structure as the vulcanizable group which could significantly enhance the cycle performance of Li-S batteries. The evolution of the chemical bond and the effects of chemical structure of polymer binders were studied in detail. The resulting electrodes exhibit a high initial capacity of 5.43 mAh cm(-2) and a reversible capacity retention of 4.06 mAh cm(-2) after 120 cycles at 0.05 C, which is superior to Li-S battery with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. The improved performance is due to the vulcanizable double bonds, which has been demonstrated to efficaciously in situ anchoring the polysulfides to the S-cathodes by the breakage of C=C to form C-S bonds.

Improving the conductivity of sulfur cathode and stabilizing the polysulfide shuttle are the key factors for obtaining high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, metallic and polar TiB2 nanomaterials are applied for the first time as sulfur hosts. The 70S/TiB2 composite exhibits a long-term cycling stability up to 500 cycles at the current density of 1 C. It is worth noting that even when the sulfur areal mass loading is up to 3.9 mg cm(-2), a stable capacity of 837 mA h g(-1) can be still maintained after 100 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performance can be attributed to the strong anchoring effect of TiB2 to lithium polysulfides, which is confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculations with a favorable surface-passivated chemistry. The study presented here will shed a new light for metal borides as hosts to improve the cycling life of lithium-sulfur batteries and provide a deep comprehension of the instinct interaction evolution at a molecular level, which is invaluable in the material rational fabrication for future high-performance Li-S batteries.

Here, a novel porous microcapsule system containing a carbon nanotubes/tin dioxide quantum dots/S (CNTs/QDs/S) composite core and a porous shell prepared through a liquid-driven coaxial microfluidic method as Li-S battery cathode is developed. The encapsulated CNTs in the microcapsules provide pathways for electron transport; SnO2 QDs on CNTs immobilize the polysulfides by strong adsorption, which is verified by using density functional theory calculations on binding energies. The porous shell of the microcapsule is beneficial for ion diffusion and electrolyte penetration. The void inside the microcapsule accommodates the volumetric change of sulfur. The Li-S battery based on the porous CNTs/QDs/S microcapsules displays a high capacity of 1025 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. When the sulfur loading is 2.03 mg cm(-2), the battery shows a stable cycling life of 700 cycles, a Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.9%, a recoverable rate-performance during repeated tests, and a good temperature tolerance at both -5 and 45 degrees C, which indicates a potential for applications at different conditions.

However, the notorious shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics are still significant challenges for further development. Herein, Ni12P5 nanoparticles are devised and grown on a reduced graphene oxide (Ni(12)P(5@)rGO) framework via a self-template and recrystallization-self-assembly strategy, as the modifier for separators in LSBs for the first time. The support of rGO for Ni12P5 nanoparticles could solve the self-aggregation problem. Ni12P5 nanoparticles not only effectively adsorb polysulfides by polar interaction, but also supply active sites to ameliorate the kinetics of the redox reaction of sulfur. Consequently, when a sulfur-containing commercial acetylene black material (70 wt% sulfur content) is used as the cathode composite without complicated fabrication or surface modification, an LSB with Ni12P5@rGO modified separator shows excellent cycling stability and a capacity degradation of 0.074% per cycle at the current density of 1 C for 500 cycles. When the areal mass of sulfur further increases to 3.5 mg cm(-2), the capacity degradation is only 0.071% per cycle at 150 cycles. This study could accelerate the application of phosphides in LSBs.

However, their practical performance is seriously limited by the dissolution and diffusion of long-chain polysulfides. In this study, a multifunctional cathodic interlayer was constructed, which composed by Mg-Al layered double hydroxides (MALDHs) modified N-doped honeycomb-like porous carbon nanofibers (NPCNFs). The NPCNFs in the prepared interlayer can combine the physical confinement of the porous structure and the chemical role of the nitrogen atoms to suppress the dissolved lithium polysulfide (LiPS). Furthermore, highly conductive interlayer contains NPCNFs can be regarded as a second current collector, and the hierarchical pores is beneficial to adapt the volume change during the redox process. More importantly, the obtained polar MALDHs not only can strongly interact with LiPS by chemical combination, but also enhance the redox kinetics by forming cooperative interface. As a result, the Li-S cells with the cathodic interlayers obtains a high initial discharge capacity of 1452 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, superior rate capability up to 2 C rate with a capacity of 952 mAh g(-1) and excellent long-term cycling stability by maintaining a low average capacity fading (0.065% per cycle) during 500 cycles at 1 C. Therefore, the interlayer contains MALDH@NPCNFs has extraordinary potential to be used in high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Despite these attractive features, the practical performances of sulfur cathode still remain a lot of challenges, such as the electrical insulating nature of S and Li2S, huge volume change during cycling, notorious shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs), sluggish redox kinetics and construction of thick electrodes with high sulfur loading. Here, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles anchored on the carbon nanotube (CNT) paper is proposed as free-standing sulfur host to address the issues. The cross-linking CNT network can serve as conductive matrix and accommodate volume change upon cycling simultaneously. Meanwhile, the CoFe2O4 nano particles are capable of effectively anchoring LiPSs to suppress the shuttle effect and accelerating LiPSs conversion to boost redox kinetics. Moreover, the free-standing paper electrode without any binder is conducive to constructing stable cathode with high sulfur loading. In consequence, the well-designed S/ CoFe2O4/CNT paper cathodes deliver impressive electrochemical performance, demonstrating an initial discharge capacity of 755.3 mAh g(-1) and remaining a high reversible capacity of 642.6 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at 2 C with an inconspicuous decay of 0.04% per cycle.

However, the poor utilization of active substrate, caused by the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide and poor electrochemical kinetics, hinders the commercial application of LiSBs. Herein, N-doping and ultrahigh surface area carbon aerogel in coral-like structure (NHCA) used as a modification of separator in LiSBs was successfully prepared by atmospheric pressure drying and activation subsequently. The introduction of NHCA not only block the shuttle effect of polysulfide with a similar effect of molecular sieve, but also built a low-resistance conductive network between the cathode and separator. After 200 cycles at 1 A/g, the capacity of cell with NHCA-7/Celgard was retained at 820 mAh/g, with just 0.13% decay per cycle. The research outcomes of this study provide a new insight for the interlayer modification of advanced LiSBs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ex situ X-ray diffraction and Raman analyses are involved to shed light on the discharge mechanism of the CFx/S cathode. The maximum power density breaks through 32023 W kg(-1) within the primary discharge by the low fluorine content CFx/S cathode. The high-fluorine content one can retain an appreciable reversible capacity after 200 cycles at ultra-fast rate of over 10 C.

The structure and composition of the prepared NMC and NMC@S composites are confirmed with nitrogen sorption, elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show a homogeneous distribution of sulfur within NMC@S. In comparison with free doped mesoporous carbon (MC), the NMC@S with high sulfur content (65%) is found to exhibit a higher initial discharge capacity of 1012 mA h g(-1) and higher capacity retention. The electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries is improved by the nitrogen doping, which not only enhances the electric conductivity but also further confines polysufides to the mesoporous carbon from shuttle effect.

The as-prepared TiO2 nanofibers possess anatase-rutile mischcrystal structure. Sulfur was mixed with the TiO2 nanofibers to form S-TiO2 composite by a melt diffusion process. The S-TiO2 composite displays more excellent discharge capacity retention of 58% after 50 cycles compared to pure S, and the discharge capacity is 530 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, which is ascribed to the adsorption of lithium polysulfide by TiO2.

The porous carbon matrix (PCM-Z), which was obtained using de-waxed cotton and ZnCl2 as an activator, has a surface area of 1056 m(2) g(-1) and a pore volume of 1.75 cm(3) g(-1). The PCM-Z was mixed with sublimed sulfur and then heated in nitrogen gas to form a carbon-sulfur 58 wt% composite (PCM-Z-S) which has excellent electro-chemical proprieties. The PCM-Z-S delivers a capacity of 850 mAh g(-1) at 1C and retains 630mA h g(-1) after nearly 200 cycles which are values much higher than that of a carbon matrix prepared without ZnCl2. These results show the sulfur-impregnated porous carbon matrix (PCM-Z-S) has great potential as a cathode material in a lithium-sulfur battery.

Morphological and structural analyses, by means of SEM and XRD, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling in lithium cells are employed for characterization of the materials. Tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether containing lithium trifluoromethansulfonate is considered the preferred electrolyte for performing the electrochemical tests. Prior to use in cells, the electrolyte characteristics in terms of H-1, Li-7, and F-19 nuclei self-diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, and ionic association degree are studied by combining NMR and impedance spectroscopy. The best lithium-sulfur composite reported herein achieves a capacity higher than 500mAhg(-1) over 140cycles with no sign of dendrite formation or failure. This performance is considered sufficiently suitable for the development of high-energy lithium batteries, in particular, considering the expected safety of the cells by employing a nonflammable glyme electrolyte instead of a conventional carbonate-based one.

The carbon matrix consists of graphene nanosheet (GS) and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT). The "GS/MWCNT@S" composite allows for infiltration of electrolyte into the cathode, assists in entrapment of polysulfide intermediates, and accommodates some of the stress and volume expansion that occurs during charge discharge processes. In addition, the uniform distribution of sulfur in the conductive carbon matrix promotes utilization of the active materials. A Li-S cell containing the GS/MWCNT@S cathode delivered a capacity of 1290.8 mAh/g and exhibited stable specific capacities up to 612.1 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.1 C. These results demonstrate that this cathode material is a promising candidate for rechargeable lithium batteries with high energy density. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of N/S atoms co-doping and the activation of KOH on NS-PACs were investigated in the macro-morphology, micro-structure, and electrochemical performance using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), as well as galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. The experimental data demonstrated that the NS-PACs show stable foam-likes porous structure, and the specific surface area (SSA) and pore volumes are 2155.81 m(2)g(-1) and 1.43 cm(3)g(-1), respectively, and reveals perfect N/S atoms doping with S atomic content of 1.4% and N atomic content of 0.78%. Moreover, the initial discharge capacity of NS-PACs is 1477.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and the extraordinary long-run cycling stability after 500 cycles reaches 803.4 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C. These outstanding electrochemical performances of NS-PACs are associated with efficient physical confinement by porous architecture together with the potent chemical adsorption of N/S atoms with polysulfide.

However, further improvement is limited by the inhomogeneity and the small amount of the doping atoms. An intercalation method to improve the conductivity and polarity of 2D-layered alpha-MoO3 nanoribbons is developed here, thus, resulting in much improved electrochemical performance as sulfur host with better rate and cycle performance. The first principle calculations show that the binding energy of MoO3 and lithium polysulfides, lithium sulfide and sulfur is significantly improved after Sn intercalation. The Sn0.063MoO3-S cathode delivers an initial specific capacity of 1390.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C with the Coulombic efficiency up to 99.7% and shows 79.6% retention of the initial capacity over 500 cycles at 1 C rate with a capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle. This intercalation method provides a new strategy to engineer the electrochemical properties of 2D materials.

The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The MCN/S composite cathode displays excellent electrochemical performance with initial discharge capacities of 1284.5 and 1107.1 mA h g(-1) for 66.7 wt% active material at 0.1 and 0.5C, respectively. And it presents good rate performance and stability with remaining discharge capacity of 828.4 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5C. The excellent performances are mainly attributed to the crosslink mesoporous structure and the strong chemical interaction between sulfur and carbon-nitrogen framework, which not only can provide polysulfides reservoirs and transport channels for the transportation of ions and electrons within MCN/S, but also is beneficial to restrain polysulfides migration.

The SEM and TEM images indicate that the nanocomposite NGNS-S-PANI consists of N-doped graphene-sheets, sulfur and PANI with a layered structure. The ternary-layered NGNS-S-PANI exhibits excellent electrochemical performance compared with the corresponding binary-layered nitrogen-doped graphene/sulfur (NGNS-S). A highest specific discharge capacity up to 1277.3 mA h g(-1) at the first cycle and 693 mA h g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.5 C were achieved with enhanced Coulombic efficiency of 98.5%, representing a promising cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. The high electrochemical performance of NGNS-S-PANI can be attributed to its well-designed ternary-layered nanoarchitecture. The rough surface of the ternary-layered composite with an elastic polyaniline (PANI) coating helps to retard the diffusion of polysulfides and to alleviate the volumetric expansion; also the nitrogen-doped graphene improved the electrical conductivity of the matrix.

This designing approach allowed performing high sulfur loading in the cathode, while maintaining prominent stability and good charge/discharge capacity. The results showed that at a sulfur loading of 2.1 mg cm(-2), the cell with S/NiCo2S4/N-CNT cathode delivered an average discharge capacity of 998 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, and preserved an excellent discharge capacity of 713 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 1 C. At the same time, the cell demonstrated high stability and reversibility delivering a capacity of 950 mA h g(-1) when current density reduced back again to 0.1C. Furthermore, the S/NiCo2S4/N-CNT cathode showed a steady capacity of 915 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C over 100 cycles.

Operando Spectromicroscopy of Sulfur Species in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Li-SM3 Conference	APR 26-27, 2017	London, ENGLAND				LI-S BATTERY; X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; IN-SITU; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; DISCHARGE PRODUCTS; POLYSULFIDES; SPECTROSCOPY; MECHANISM; SHUTTLE; ADSORPTION	In this study, a novel cross-sectional battery cell was developed to characterize lithium-sulfur batteries using X-ray spectromicroscopy. Chemically sensitive X-raymaps were collected operando at energies relevant to the expected sulfur species and were used to correlate changes in sulfur species with electrochemistry. Significant changes in the sulfur/carbon composite electrode were observed from cycle to cycle including rearrangement of the elemental sulfur matrix and PEO10LiTFSI binder. Polysulfide concentration and area of spatial diffusion increased with cycling, indicating that some polysulfide dissolution is irreversible, leading to polysulfide shuttle. Fitting of the maps using standard sulfur and polysulfide XANES spectra indicated that upon subsequent discharge/charge cycles, the initial sulfur concentration was not fully recovered; polysulfides and lithium sulfide remained at the cathodes with higher order polysulfides as the primary species in the region of interest. Quantification of the polysulfide concentration across the electrolyte and electrode interfaces shows that the polysulfide concentration before the first discharge and after the third charge is constant within the electrolyte, but while cycling, a significant increase in polysulfides and a gradient toward the lithium metal anode forms. This chemically and spatially sensitive characterization and analysis provides a foundation for further operando spectromicroscopy of lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

Their practical applications, however, are largely compromised by poor cycling stability and rate capability because of detrimental shuffling of polysulfide intermediates, complicated multiphase sulfur redox reactions, and uncontrolled precipitation of the discharge products (lithium sulfide, Li2S). Herein, monodispersed Co single-atom catalyst on conductive nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet (CoSA-N-C) with high Co content of 15.3 wt% was fabricated through a salt-template method and used as a sulfur host material to simultaneously alleviate the polysulfide shuffling, propel the redox kinetics of dissolved polysulfides, and mediate the deposition of Li2S. The robust two-dimensional architecture of CoSA-N-C with large surface area, high porosity, and dual lithiophilic-sulfiphilic Co-N species enable strong physical and chemical polysulfides confinement and fast electrons/ions transfer process. The densely populated Co-N-4 coordinated moieties function as electrocatalytic sites to accelerate the reversible conversion between lithium polysulfides and Li2S. Importantly, the CoSA-N-C enables spatially controlled deposition of Li2S nanoparticles during the battery discharge process, as opposed to conventional Li2S passivation layers that fully covered the conductive host. Consequently, the as-fabricated cathodes based on the CoSA-N-C deliver high sulfur utilization (1574 mAh-g(-1) at 0.05 C), outstanding rate capability (624 mAh g(-1) at 5 C) and superior long-term stability (capacity fade rate of 0.035% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 1 C). Even under a sulfur loading up to 4.9 mg cm(-2), the reversible areal capacity could reach 4.24 mAh cm(-2) after 120 cycles at 0.2 C, delivering an ultrahigh capacity retention of 91.8%. This work sheds inspiring insights on the important role of single atomic metal with high mass loading in mediating the deposition of lithium sulfides and accelerating the reversible conversion of lithium polysulfides toward decent-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur and the dissolution of the polysulfides Li2S5 (4 <= n <= 8) seriously restrict its practical application. The metastable small sulfur molecules (S2-4) stored in microporous carbon (pore size of <0.6 nm) as the active materials can avoid the production of the soluble polysulfide and solve the shuttle effect thoroughly. In addition, the conductivity of sulfur can be also improved. However, the preparation of microporous carbon materials with reasonable pore size and unique morphology for efficiently encapsulating S2-4 is still challenging. Herein, three flowerlike microporous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets with the pore size of <0.6 nm (namely, FMNCN-800, -900, and -1000) as the cathode materials in Li-S batteries were obtained from temperature-dependent carbonization of the metal-organic framework (MOF), Zn-TDPAT, which was from the simply reflux reaction of N-rich ligand H(6)TDPAT with Zn(II) salt. Our study showed that the FMNCN-900 from carbonization of Zn-TDPAT at 900 degrees C has suitable pore volume and nitrogen content, accommodating small S2-4 molecules in its micropores with the mass uptake of about 45%. Meanwhile, the appropriate amount of the nitrogen doping and the unique nanostnicture of the flowerlike carbon nanosheet in the FMNCN-900 can effectively support its fast electronic transmission and lithium-ion conduction. The resulting S@FMNCN-900 composite cathode material presents the excellent electrochemical property in the Li-S battery (here the carbonate as electrolytes) with a reversible capacity of about 1220 mAh/g at 0.1C after 200 cycles and even 727 mAh/g at 2C after the long-term cycle of 1000 with only around 0.02% capacity loss per cycle. Obviously, the results indicate that the delicate construction of MOF-derived nitrogen-doped microporous carbon nanosheet is a promising strategy to develop novel electrode material for high-performing Li-S batteries.

Therefore, it is urgent to find a novel host material that could tackle these problems with a cost-effective manner. Herein, the mesoporous and hollow carbon sphere embedded with homogeneous VN quantum dots (noted as VN-H-C) is constructed and applied as an efficient host for a sulfur cathode, which features both physical and chemical trapping ability for soluble LiPSs. More importantly, VN quantum dots can significantly accelerate the electrochemical conversion of LiPSs. As a consequence, the S@VN-H-C cathode exhibits a high specific capacity of 856.5 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and maintains 602.5 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of only 0.059% per cycle. This study provides a feasible strategy for designing nanostructured materials as effective sulfur hosts in Li-S batteries.

The chromium doping remarkably controls structure, decreases carbon sphere size and promotes network interconnect. The nano Cr-CA composites with large pore volume and high specific surface present stronger adsorption ability and effectively immobilize polysulfides. The Cr-CA/S composite cathodes display excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacity and long cycling stability. Especially, the Cr-2-CA/S cathode with 65.9 wt% of sulfur delivers initial specific capacity of 1343 and 987 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 0.2 C and 2 C, respectively. It exhibits the outstanding long-term cyclic stability with the discharge capacity of 873mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C for the 300th cycle. The excellent performance is mainly attributed to special anchoring role of Cr2O3 to polysulfides and its catalytic effect for redox reaction process. Furthermore, the adsorb energy between polysulfides and Cr2O3 and theoretic analysis by DFT definitely reveals and supports immobilizing and catalytic mechanism. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

When co-mixed with 1,3-dioxolane (DOL), the DOL/TFEE electrolyte suppressed the polysulfide dissolution and shuttling reaction.

However, owing to interface incompatibility between the nanocarbon with homogeneous nonpolar surface and intrinsic polar sulfur guests, the cathode materials still face poor stability during the long-term cycling process. Herein, based on a highly effective sulfur host, namely manganese oxide nanosheets grown on both sides of the N-doped hollow porous carbon nanospheres (NHCSs@MnO2), we put forward a rational physical and chemical dual-encapsulation strategy for the application of advanced Li-S batteries. The multifunctional, integrated and hollow hybrid nanospheres can provide efficient electron-modified interface, hold much more active material, and importantly face-to-face effectively prevent polysulfide dissolution and diffusion via the synergistic restriction, thus the developed NHCSs@MnO2/S composite exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1249 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and a sustainable cycling stability with ultralow capacity decay of only 0.041% per cycle over 1000 cycles, implying its great prospects for the improved cyclability and electrochemical performance as application of advanced Li-S battery.

Atomic layers of TiO2 were further deposited on the electrode and the thickness was controlled by adjusting the number of deposition cycles to 0, 5, 20 and 40. The results showed that all the surface modified electrodes demonstrate high capacity, good rate capability, and enhanced cyclability compared to the bare electrode. Specifically, the electrode contained 59% (by weight, wt%) sulfur and with the addition of 20 cycle-TiO2 it demonstrated a superior boost in the active sulfur utilization (discharge capacity: 1374 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C). It also delivered initial discharge capacity up to 1069.5 mA h g(-1) and 918.3 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C with an average coulombic efficiency of about 99.7%. Moreover, the capacity retention increased from 42% to 61% from 0.1C to 4C with the addition of 20 cycle-TiO2. The improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the on-site TiO2 absorption for polysulfide retention as well as the charge transfer enhancement. Theoretical calculations revealed that TiO2 exhibits a strong binding energy for lithium polysulfide species. These results suggest that the TiO2 modified NG has potential to be used as a cathode for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The influence of alkali/carbon ratio and activation temperature on pore feature and electrochemical performance of C/S composites was investigated. Pore volume was found to have a positive correlation with discharge capacity and cycle stability and an inverse correlation to overall impedance. Porous carbon with largest pore volume of 2.04 cm(3) g(-1) obtained at alkali/carbon ratio of 3.5 and 800 degrees C was able to accommodate 65 wt.% sulfur. Highest discharge capacity of 796 mA h g(-1) was delivered at 0.5 C and 80.5% of it was kept after 100 cycles. After 500 cycles, the composite still delivered a high discharge capacity of 615 InA h g(-1), indicating superior cyclestability. Optimization on sulfur content in C/S composite was explored and 65 wt.% was found to be the best proportion. Both too low and too high sulfur content resulted in inferior electrochemical performance.

Herein, we present a facile synthesis of hollow carbon nanoballs (HCNBs) anchored with ultrafine TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2@HCNBs) in which the HCNBs with hollow interiors and graphitic crystallization accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur upon lithiation and improve the cathode conductivity, while the TiO2 nanoparticles effectively trap the polysulfides through strong chemical bonding. Notably, the SpTiO(2)@HCNBs with a high sulfur loading of , similar to 73 wt % demonstrate superior cycle performance at 0.5 C over 600 cycles with a slow capacity decay and deliver high specific capacities of 1217, 1013, 893, and 773 mA h/g at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 C, respectively. The adsorption test clearly reveals the efficient suppression of the polysulfide shuttling owing to the spatial and chemical confinement of the TiO2@HCNBs host.

Herein, the two-dimensional nitrogen/sulfur synchronous-doped few-layer graphene (N, S-FLG) was prepared by a simple calcination route at 900 degrees C under an argon atmosphere with g-C3N4 as a structural template. The calcination temperature favorably adjusted the doping levels and surface texture of the as-obtained samples. Relying on the synergistic interaction of the structural traits, as the reservoir of sulfur, NS-FLG-900 (calcination temperature 900 degrees C) can maintain a reversible capacity of 602 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at a current density of 0.8 A g(-1) and 506.4 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at a current density of 1.6 A g(-1). The outstanding performance is obtained due to the synergistic effect of the introduction of N and S into the carbon lattice, the high pore volume (1.31 cm(3) g(-1)) and large specific surface area (460.9 m(2) g(-1)).

The optimum content of DBP was found to be 400 wt% with respect to the polymer for achieving the highest ionic conductivity. Microporous polymer electrolytes (MPEs) were prepared by incorporating liquid electrolytes in the membrane. A maximum ionic conductivity of 1.5x10(-3) (S/cm) was obtained at room temperature when using 1 M LiBF4 and 1 M LiPF6 solutions in TEGDME/EC (1:1). The MPEs were evaluated for the first discharge capacity in Li/S cells, which exhibited a single plateau at ca. 2.6 V, with a maximum discharge capacity of 900 mAh/g for LiPF6 in TEGDME/EC electrolyte. The binary solvent TEGDME/EC was found to be more suitable than PC/EC for Li/S cells in terms of the first discharge capacity. The active material utilization of the sulfur cathode was found to be better for 40 wt% sulfur, relative to higher sulfur contents; we attribute this phenomenon to the effectiveness of the conductive carbon coating on sulfur present at this composition.

However, the application of Li-S batteries has been hindered by the poor conductivity of sulfur, polysulfides diffusion, and unsatisfactory practical gravimetric energy density. Herein, the lightweight multiwalled carbon nanotube/polyacrylic acid (MWCNT/PAA) composite film was developed, which could combine functions of the current collector and conductive interlayer into one composite film, to realize the integrated sulfur cathode with successful sufficient electron transport and strong polysulfides adsorption. As a result, the cathode could deliver not only improved cycle performance but also a higher discharging capacity based on the total electrode mass, demonstrating the promising application of the two-in-one integrated sulfur cathode in high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, we report an ultrathin yet multifunctional polysulfide blocking layer (MPBL) coated on the cathode to effectively restrain the polysulfides shuttling. This MPBL, which was prepared by a simple, one-step electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique, was fully and compactly coated on the electrode with controllable thickness, realizing the full protection of the whole cathode. It is noted that the MPBL can be very thin that guarantees the fast ion diffusion but still keeps a high efficiency of blocking polysulfides due to a combination of physical (from carbon) and chemical confinement (from conductive polymer). In addition, the MPBL with good conductivity can act as the upper current collector to reuse the captured polysulfides, and thus improve the sulfur utilization during cycling. With such multifunctional design, the MPBL-coated carbon-sulfur cathode exhibits long cyclic stability and high rate capability, which has only 0.042% capacity decay per cycle at 1C for 1000 cycles and a capacity of 615 mA h g(-1) even at a high rate of 3C.

The resulting carbon material has a specific area as high as 3271 m(2)g(-1) and a hierarchical porous structure consisting of mixed parts microporous (< 2nm) and low range mesoporous (2-50 nm) volumes with majority of pores less than 3 nm in diameter. Sulfur/carbon composites with 80 wt% and 90 wt% sulfur contents were obtained using a simple wet chemical deposition method. It is found that the sulfur is uniformly dispersed inside the nanopotes, which is favorable for both the good utilization of sulfur and the confinement of intermediated soluble lithium polysulfides. N -doping can further enhance the chemical interaction between polar polysulfides and the carbon host. When used as a cathode, this composite with high sulfur content exhibited good cycle and rate performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The nanocasting approach with a polycarbosilane precursor and subsequent pyrolysis, followed by silica template removal and chlorine treatment, results in carbide-derived carbons DUT-86 (DUT = Dresden University of Technology) with remarkable textural characteristics, monodisperse, spherical mesopores tunable in diameter, and very high pore volumes up to 5.0 cm(3) g(-1). Morphology replication allows these nanopores to be arranged in a nanostructured inverse opal-like structure. Specific surface areas are very high (2450 m(2) g(-1)) due to the simultaneous presence of micropores. Testing DUT-86 samples as cathode materials in Li-S batteries reveals excellent performance, and tailoring of the pore size allows optimization of cell performance, especially the active center accessibility and sulfur utilization. The outstanding pore volumes allow sulfur loadings of 80 wt %, a value seldom achieved in composite cathodes, and initial capacities of 1165 mAh gsulfur(-1) are reached.

However, practical applications of Li-S batteries are still limited by the relatively low performance, owing to poor conductivity of sulfur itself and discharge products (Li2S/Li2S2) as well as the shuttle effect of the intermediate polysulfide. Herein, honeycomb-like mesoporous Co, N-doped carbon nanosheets (MC-NS) with a high specific surface area and abundant defects are developed which, simultaneously enable polysulfide confinement and highly efficient conversion. Moreover, density functional theory calculations and experiments show that the Co-N-C catalytic site as well as defects on the carbon skeleton of the MC-NS facilitate high efficiency in suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. In situ Raman spectra further demonstrate the enhancement of adsorption ability and conversion efficiency of polysulfides on this host. As a result, the MC-NS enables much increased specific capacity and cycling stability of Li-S batteries. This work provides a useful strategy for realizing practical applications of high-performance Li-S batteries.

In this study, first-principles with density functional theory study was adopted to investigate the anchoring behavior of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) on InP3 monolayer. The structures of different LiPSs adsorbed on InP3 monolayer were obtained by calculating the adsorption energy, charge transfer and adsorption distance. The electron distribution and the electronic properties were investigated and the stability of LiPSs on InP3 monolayer was studied. The results indicate that InP3 monolayer shows strong chemical interactions with LiPSs because of the considerable adsorption energies (from -1.08 eV to -4.43 eV in vacuum and -0.94 eV to -3.21 eV in DME/DOL solvent). The adsorption of LiPSs on InP3 monolayer can also result in electron redistribution and reduction of the energy gap near Fermilevel in density of states (DOS). Moreover, InP3 monolayer can also maintain a balance between anchoring and intactness of LiPSs. Our study demonstrates that InP3 monolayer can be an excellent anchoring material for Li-S batteries and can provide theoretical basis of exploring novel 2D materials in field of energy storage.

However, the rapid performance degradation associated with the so-called "shuttle effect" during the charge-discharge process in a typical lithium-sulfur battery greatly limits its practical application. Modification of the separator in a lithium-sulfur battery is an effective approach to alleviate the "shuttle effect". Here, we report a facile method to generate a novel SnO2 functionalized separator to tackle the problem of polysulfide shuttling. We show that the functionalized separator has a neglectable weight/volume increase compared to the pristine separator, which is important for the maintenance of a high energy density of the battery. The functionalized SnO2 serves as a multi-functional layer that improves the performance of the battery. On one hand, the SnO2 layer enhances the compatibility and wettability between the separator and electrolyte, and thus promotes the transfer of Li+. On the other hand, the strong physical/chemical interaction between SnO2 and polysulfide ions helps to suppress the migration of polysulfide effectively. As a consequence of these features, lithium-sulfur battery assembled with SnO2 functionalized separator shows excellent cycling stability and improved rate performance.

However, liquid electrolyte-based LSBs suffer from "polysulfide shuttle", and safety concerns originated from the use of flammable organic electrolytes and the formation of lithium dendrites. Herein, we report a novel bilayer framework through integrating a three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanofiber/sulfur (CNF/S) cathode with one-dimensional (1D) ceramic Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) nanofiber-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solid composite electrolyte to serve as both cathode and electrolyte for room-temperature ASSLSBs. The stabilized cycling performance of this novel bilayer structure design lies in the reduced interfacial resistance and enhanced electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability due to the addition of Li+ conducting 1D LLTO nanofibers, as well as the formed fast-continuous electron/ion transportation pathways within the 3D cathode architecture. Meanwhile, the mechanically robust bilayer framework with micro-/meso-pores could also accommodate the large volume change of sulfur during continuous charge-discharge process and help suppress the Li dendrite formation. As a result of the aforementioned benefits of the novel bilayer structure design, the introduced ASSLSBs could deliver a stable cycling performance at room temperature with high Coulombic efficiency of over 99%.

However, their highly coordinated, electronically insulating and structurally unstable nature overshadows the merits of MOFs to a great extent. In this work, a novel UiO-66/carbon nanotube (UC) composite was initially synthesized via a facile one-pot synthesis strategy, in which abundant linker-missing defects were caused by introduced competitive coordination. Meanwhile, flexible and interlaced carbon nanotubes (CNTs) throughout mechanically stable UiO-66 nanoparticles constructed a reliable conductive network. Because of its superior structural stability, high electronic conductivity and strong polysulfide chemisorption, the UC architecture as the sulfur cathode in Li-S batteries shows stable cycling, delivering an initial capacity of 925 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and a very low fading rate over 800 cycles of 0.071% per cycle at 1 A g(-1). A strong chemical affinity between coordination defects and LiPSs was revealed by first principles calculations and apparent absorption, which indicates significant entrapment of soluble polysulfides by the UC composite, thus leading to the outstanding cycling performance of S@UC electrodes.

In this regard, sulfur is loaded with three different materials such as metal oxide (MnO2) and carbon source of Acetylene Black (AB) and polymer Polyethylene glycol (PEG) which can be used as an electrode for Li-S batteries. The structural and morphological behavior has been analyzed by x-ray diffraction, Raman analysis and scanning electron microscopy. S/MnO2 composite delivers a discharge capacity of 1030 mAh g(-1) in its initial cycle. S/MnO2 composite has a strong ability to adsorb the lithium polysulfides escalating the Coulombic efficiency.

However, most of the previous work has mainly focused on tackling the "polysulfide shuttle" originating from the S cathode, while the dendrite problem coming from the Li metal anode has often been overlooked. Herein, to solve the issues arising from both the cathode and anode simultaneously, we propose a novel cell configuration for the first time by inserting CNT films on both sides of the separator in Li-S batteries, in which the cathode-side CNT film works as a shield to suppress the "polysulfide shuttle" and the anode-side CNT film acts as a powerful shield to prevent the Li dendrite growth. In the new cell configuration, the S/rGO cathode with a high S loading of about 4.0 mg cm(-2) displays a high specific capacity (1336 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), excellent rate ability (1070, 833, 656, and 444 mAh g(-1) at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively), and sustainable cycling stability for 150 cycles with high Coulombic efficiency (>99%) at 1 C, while the Li metal anode displays an ultrasmooth surface. We believe this work will aid in developing other metal-based (e.g., Na, K, Zn, and Al) batteries.

In this paper, a novel electrode material which synthesized by yttrium oxide (Y2O3) nanorods modified Ketjen black@sulfur (Y2O3/KB@S) composites is introduced and evaluated in Li-S batteries. Y2O3 nanorods have good adsorption-catalytic synergistic effect on polysulfides, which can curb the shuttle effect and enhance the redox kinetics of polysulfides. The initial specific discharge capacity of Y2O3/KB@S electrode shows 828 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C current density, and the capacity maintains at 388 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with the areal sulfur loading of 3.1 mg cm(-2). Furthermore, Y2O3/KB@S cathode delivered 5.09 mAh g(-1) discharge capacity and retained 4.21 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C current density when the areal sulfur loading increasing to 5.0 mg cm(-2). Therefore, Y2O3 nanorods modified Li-S battery cathode material has good application potential in its industrialization process. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In situ sulfur deposition route to obtain sulfur-carbon composite cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; DISCHARGE PROCESS; BLACK COMPOSITES; RATE CAPABILITY; POLYSULFIDES; PERFORMANCE; REDUCTION; CELLS	An in situ sulfur deposition route has been developed for synthesizing sulfur-carbon composites as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. This facile synthesis method involves the precipitation of elemental sulfur into the nanopores of conductive carbon black (CCB). The microstructure and morphology of the composites are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicate that most of the sulfur in the amorphous phase is chemically well-dispersed in the nanopores of the CCB. The sulfur content in the composites is confirmed using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The S-CCB composites with different sulfur content (52 wt%, 56 wt% and 62 wt%) deliver remarkably high initial capacities of up to 1534.6, 1357.4 and 1185.9 mA h g (1) at the current density of 160 mA g (1), respectively. Correspondingly, they maintain stable capacities of 1012.2, 957.9 and 798.6 mA h g(-1) with the capacity retention of over 75.1% after 100 cycles, exhibiting excellent cycle stability. The electrochemical reaction mechanism for the lithium-sulfur batteries during the discharge process is investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The significantly improved electrochemical performance of the S-CCB composite is attributed to the carbon-wrapped sulfur structure, which suppresses the loss of active material during charging-discharging and the restrained migration of the polysulfide ions to the anode. This facile in situ sulfur deposition method represents a low-cost approach to obtain high performance sulfur-carbon composite cathodes for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries.	[Wang, W.

Effect of Graphene on Sulfur/Polyacrylonitrile Nanocomposite Cathode in High Performance Lithium/Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; REVERSIBLE CAPACITY; CYCLE PERFORMANCE; SULFUR BATTERIES; ANODE MATERIAL; COMPOSITE; ELECTROLYTE; ETHER	A novel sulfur/polyacrylonitrile/graphene nanocomposite has been synthesized via a simple combination of ballmilling with low temperature heat-treatment. The nanocomposite was examined as a cathode for high performance lithium/sulfur batteries. The SEM and TEM observations revealed that sulfur/polyacrylonitrile particles are incorporated into graphene networks homogenously. Charge/discharge tests and ac impedance spectroscopy have shown improved conductivity and electrochemical properties of the composite with the addition of graphene. The lithium cell with this ternary composite cathode delivered a discharge capacity of 612 mAh g(-1) in the second cycle at 0.1 C, and retained about 77% of this value over 100 cycles. Even up to 4 C rate, the lithium cell demonstrated an excellent rate capability, delivering a highly reversible discharge capacity of 360 mAh g(-1). (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

The activated carbon aerogel was used as a conductive host of elemental sulfur to prepare a composite by a melt-infiltration method. Nitrogen adsorption, SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the samples before and after the sulfur infiltration. Cyclic voltammetry,, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the composite as a cathode in lithium ion batteries. It is found that the composite has a sulfur content of up to 6.6. 2%, a high initial discharge capacity of 1 287 mAh.g(-1) at a current density of O. 2 C and a retained capacity of 643 mAh.g(-1) after 200 cycles, which are much higher than those of a sulfur cathode without the carbon host. The composite also exhibits excellent rate capability.

The electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries largely depends on the efficient reversible conversion of Li polysulfides to Li2S in discharge and to elemental S during charging. Here, we report on our discovery that monodisperse cobalt atoms embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (Co-N/G) can trigger the surfacemediated reaction of Li polysulfides. Using a combination of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculation, we reveal that the Co-N-C coordination center serves as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to facilitate both the formation and the decomposition of Li2S in discharge and charge processes, respectively. The S@Co-N/G composite, with a high S mass ratio of 90 wt %, can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 1210 mAh g(-1), and it exhibits an areal capacity of 5.1 mAh cm(-2) with capacity fading rate of 0.029% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.2 C at S loading of 6.0 mg cm(-2) on the electrode disk.

Enhanced Li-S Batteries Using Amine-Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes in the Cathode	ACS NANO			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; molecular sorbents; lithium-nitrile interactions; sequestering lithium polysulfide	SULFUR BATTERY; ENERGY-STORAGE; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITES; CAPACITY	The rechargeable lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is an attractive platform for high-energy, low-cost electrochemical energy storage. Practical Li-S cells are limited by several fundamental issues, including the low conductivity of sulfur and its reduction compounds with Li and the dissolution of long-chain lithium polysulfides (LiPS) into the electrolyte. We report on an approach that allows high-performance sulfur carbon cathodes to be designed based on tethering polyethylenimine (PEI) polymers bearing large numbers of amine groups in every molecular unit to hydroxyl- and carboxyl-functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes. Significantly, for the first time we show by means of direct dissolution kinetics measurements that the incorporation of CNT-PEI hybrids in a sulfur cathode stabilizes the cathode by both kinetic and thermodynamic processes. Composite sulfur cathodes based the CNT-PEI hybrids display high capacity at both low and high current rates, with capacity retention rates exceeding 90%. The attractive electrochemical performance of the materials is shown by means of DFT calculations and physical analysis to originate from three principal sources: (i) specific and strong interaction between sulfur species and amine groups in PEI; (ii) an interconnected conductive CNT substrate; and (iii) the combination of physical and thermal sequestration of UPS provided by the CNT=PEI composite.

A simple and general approach for in situ synthesis of sulfur-porous carbon composites for lithium-sulfur batteries	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; LI-S BATTERIES; RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM; CATHODE MATERIALS; MESOPOROUS CARBONS; ELECTRODES; ACTIVATION; PARTICLES; STABILITY; BIOMASS	Porous carbon materials constitute an excellent conductive matrix for the immobilization of sulfur in the cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we provide a novel, easy, sustainable, general and scalable procedure for the preparation of such cathodes, which combines in the same process both the generation of a S-doped porous carbon and the incorporation of elemental sulfur within the pores. To achieve this, a biomass-based substance (i.e., tannic acid) is activated with sodium thiosulfate, yielding a carbonized solid that includes a high-surface area carbon (up to 2550 m(2) g(-1)) and sodium polysulfides. Once this solid is immersed in an acid medium, the polysulfides generated as activation by-products are oxidized in situ to elemental sulfur that spontaneously diffuses into the pores of the carbon, which gives rise to the hybrid sulfur-carbon composite. When tested as cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries, these hybrid materials exhibit high sulfur utilization (similar to 80%) even for the composites with a sulfur content as high as 82%, as well as an excellent rate performance (590 mA h g(-1) S at 5C). The cycling stability of the batteries was confirmed by their low capacity fading (0.049% of capacity decay per cycle), maintaining 85% of their initial capacity after 300 charge-discharge cycles at 1C. Cathodes with a high sulfur loading (7.1 mg S per cm(2)) were steady cycled providing reversible areal capacities of 4.4 mA h cm(-2) at 0.2C after 100 charge-discharge cycles.

Valence modulating/engineering of the metal active centers is an underlying tactic to expedite the sluggish kinetics of LiPSs for high performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we craft Zn2+-modulated bimetallic carbides electrocatalyst of Co3ZnC-embedded carbon submicrospheres anchoring on 3D macro-mesoporous N-doped carbon (denoted as Co3ZnC@NC) via a facile one-pot synthesis that employs dicyandiamide as the carbon/nitrogen precursor. Results demonstrate that the balance of the predominantly active Co2+/Co-0 pair can be effectively modulated by the incorporated zinc cations, which leads to inhibited shuttle effect and accelerates the catalytic conversion kinetics of LiPS intermediates. When acted as the interlayer to modify commercial separator, Co3ZnC@NC confers the superb cycling stability on corresponding Li-S batteries with high discharge capacities and exceptionally high-rate performance, owing to the well-defined surface structure and the increased Co2+ active sites of Co3ZnC@NC. Even the sulfur loading is kept at 4 mg cm(-2), the battery achieves an areal capacity of 3.22 mAh cm(-2) after 50 cycles. This work unveils the potential of cation modulated bimetal-based electrocatalysts and also inspires an alternative avenue to exploit surface mediated redox electrocatalysts for high-performance Li-S batteries.

In the present study, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets wrapped Sulfur nanocomposite (S-RGO) synthesized by hydrothermal method and confirmed the wrapping of RGO sheets on Sulfur nanoparticles by various analytical techniques. The synthesized S-RGO nanocomposite demonstrated improved interaction of sulfur nanoparticles with RGO which is confirmed through XPS analysis. The synthesized S-RGO resulted in significantly improved reversible specific capacity and higher rate capability (823 mAh/g at 0.1C, 400 mAh/g at 1C) with 77 wt% of sulfur loading amount on the cathode of the Li?S battery. Therefore, the present study opens up new insights into sustainable development in the field of Li?S battery energy storage applications.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed that this treatment doped fluorine and oxygen on the surface of the CNT, and experimental results showed that this treatment had significantly improved adsorption of polysulfides in the CNT sponge. As a result, this sponge cathode accommodated a remarkably high sulfur areal loading of 8 mg cm(-2), showing a high areal capacity of 7.1 mAh cm(-2) at the 100th cycle at an areal current density of 1.28 mA cm(-2) with an average capacity fading of 0.048% per cycle. The adsorbing energy of Li2S6 on the F/O-doped carbon structure was calculated using the density functional theory, confirming that the doping made the polysulfide adsorption stable particularly due to fluorine. This study provides a useful approach of simultaneously introducing both fluorine and oxygen to carbon in order to significantly improve the polysulfide adsorption on the carbon cathode and thereby obtain high areal discharge capacity, which is much more important than specific discharge capacity for actual battery operation.

Manganese dioxide (MnO2), one kind of transition metal oxide, is widely applied to decorate the PP (Polypropylene) separator. However, the fabrication by physical coating is always multistep and complicated. Here, we design a simple and fast method to chemically decorate separator. Based on the oxidizing property of acidic KMnO4 solution, the PP separator was oxidized and an ultrathin self-assembled MnO2 layer was directly constructed on one side of separator, by immersing in acidic KMnO4 solution for only 1 h. The self-assembled MnO2 layer has the synergistic effect of adsorption and catalytic conversion on polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect. It can also help battery to maintain excellent electrochemical kinetics in the electrochemical cycle and maintain the effective recycling of active substances. As a result, the shuttling of polysulfide is greatly prohibited by this novel functional separator, and cycling stability is outstandingly improved, with a low-capacity decaying of 0.058% after 500 cycles at 0.5C. The rapid and simple modification method proposed in this study has a certain reference value for the future large-scale application of lithium-sulfur battery. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Here, an all-in-one design concept for a Janus separator, enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy, is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of the anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains high-elastic-modulus and high-thermal-conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen-group-grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), by which the formation of "hot spots" can be effectively avoid, the Li-ion flux homogenized, and dendrite growth suppressed. Meanwhile, at the interface between the separator and the cathode, the homogenously exposed single-atom Ru on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can "trap" polysulfides and reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g(-1) at 5C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of the Janus separator, a lithium-sulfur pouch cell using the Janus separator delivers a cell-level energy density of 310.2 Wh kg(-1). This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the Li anode and the sulfur cathode in LSBs.

It was fabricated by one-step hydrothermal synthesis, follow by chemical vapor deposition method. The oxygen defects on the surface of Co/TiO2-x@carbon enhanced its electrical conductivity and strengthened the chemical interactions with polysulfides toward superior sulfur confinement. Moreover, the carbon coating layer has a hollow spherical architecture that can accelerate electron or ion transportation. Additionally, the Co nanoparticles promote sulfur redox conversion. Benefiting from these synergistic features, the S/Co/TiO2-x@carbon electrode delivers outstanding cycling stability (the capacity decay rate of 0.044% per cycle after 500 cycles) and a superior rate performance (972 mAh g(-1) at 2.0C).

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were added into the composites as a modifier on GNS layers. The embedment of SWCNTs into composites can inhibit agglomeration of GNS and increase an effective surface area of the structural electroactive sites. The electrochemical property of the composites was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge curves and cycle performance. The micro-structure and morphology of the composites were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transition electron microscopy (TEM). The GNS/SWCNT/sulfur composites exhibited the improved current density of redox reaction and the cycle stability for an application of rechargeable lithium-sulfur cells.

Carbon aerogels can not only serve as electroactive materials for secondary batteries, but also can serve as carbon matrices to disperse electroactive materials or to confine electroactive materials. According to the type of carbon precursors employed in the area of secondary batteries, carbon aerogels can be divided into four kinds, that is phenolic resin derived carbon aerogels, carbon nanotube aerogels, graphene aerogels and biomass derived carbon aerogels. In this review, we first provide a brief review on the synthesis of these carbon aerogels in sequence. The preparation of phenolic resin derived carbon aerogels usually involves five steps: (1) sol formation; (2) gelation; (3) solvent exchange; (4) drying; (5) carbonization. For the successful preparation of carbon nanotube aerogels, surfactant assistance or surface functionalization is necessary. Resorcinol-formaldehyde derived carbons, carbon nanotubes, biopolymers were usually employed as crosslinkers to enhance physical and chemical properties of graphene aerogels. Natural biomass could be converted into carbon aerogel by a hydrothermal treatment, freeze-drying and post-pyrolysis process. Next, we summarize the recent progress and advances on carbon aerogels and carbon aerogel based materials for secondary batteries, focusing on lithium ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries. For lithium ion batteries, most of researches concentrated on carbon aerogel based nanocomposites as anode materials. For lithium-sulfur batteries, carbon aerogels, heteroatoms doped carbon aerogels and carbon aerogel based nanocomposites were used as hosts for immobilization of sulfur species and as interlayers to further block the penetration of lithium polysulfides.

Introducing suitable anchoring materials to immobilize and even convert Li2Sn species is an effective strategy to alleviate this question for achieving excellent cycling performance. Herein, the anchoring performance of a series of pi-conjugated metal bis(dithiolene) complex nanosheets (M3C12S12, where M denotes Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, and Pd) for Li-S batteries was investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations. Our results revealed that the M3C12S12 nanosheet exhibits remarkable binding strength for trapping soluble Li2Sn species due to the significant synergistic effect between M and S atoms in M3C12S12 and keeps the intact structures of the soluble Li2Sn species. Especially, the M3C12S12 nanosheet can also act as effective catalyst for S reduction during discharge process and Li2S oxidation during charge process. Thus, the M3C12S12 nanosheet can be utilized as an excellent bi-functional material for the capture and catalytic conversion of Li2Sn species Li-S batteries.

Compared to pure sulfur and TAC@S composite, the core shell structured TAC@S@PPy composite exhibits a higher discharge specific capacity of 1111 mAh g(-1), and still maintains at 731 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 335 mA g(-1). Whereas, TAC@S composite and pure sulfur only retain 472 and 224 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at the same current density, respectively. Therefore, these results indicate that the core-shell structured TAC@S@PPy composite with a dual-conductive layer would be a promising cathode for LSBs.

The Li-S cells with PEI showed a significant improvement in cycle performance as well as in discharge capacity, compared with the Li-S cells using PVP only. The discharge capacity at the 50th cycle was found to be similar to 580 mAh/g-sulfur, 83% of an initial capacity (similar to 720 mAh/g-sulfur), at a high current density of 2.0 mA cm(-2). It was observed that the Li-S cells with a mixed electrolyte of 0.5 M LiCF3SO3/0.5 M TBAPF(6) did not show a distinct improvement in the aspect of discharge capacity. The Li-S cells, however, showed a significant enhancement in the cycle life characteristics much better than that of Li-S cells with 1.0 M LiCF3SO3. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, hydroxylate multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-OH) were grafted with a supramolecular polymer (heptakis(6-amino-6-deoxy)-beta-cyclodextrin) to form a polysulfide-engulfing net, which was coated on a separator. Such a molecular microarray structure of a polymer can block the polysulfides and have biomimetic cellular behavior for engulfing polysulfides. The cavity (similar to 6 A) and functional groups of the supramolecular polymer can provide a dynamic structure for reversible adsorption of polysulfides while the conductive MWCNT-OH ensure fast electron transfer. The batteries with the modified separator exhibited excellent rate capacities (945.5 and 625.4 mA h g(-1) at 2 C and 4 C rates, respectively). Especially, the high areal capacities of 5.86 and 7.2 mA h cm(-2) achieved at S loadings of 4.5 and 6.0 mg cm(-2) and good cycling stability after 200 cycles at 0.1 C can be obtained. This demonstrates a strategy of supramolecular polymer-grafted carbon for dynamic polysulfide adsorption toward advanced Li-S batteries.

Herein, a universal "three-region" configuration including: Region I (sulfur source region), Region II (LiPS electrocatalysis region), and Region III (multi-functional shield) for high-areal capacity Li-S batteries is proposed. Mechanism of the configuration including the competitive relationship between Region II and Region III based on the Sabatier principle is further confirmed through density functional theory theoretical simulation and a series of in situ experimental methods. Compared with a conventional mechanical mixing electrode structure, it is demonstrated that the orderly integration "three-region" configuration is able to prevent shuttling of LiPS effectively, which delivers high gravimetric energy density at the sulfur loading of 10.7 mg cm(-2). Furthermore, a pouch cell achieves a high capacity of 148.15 mAh at a sulfur loading of 108 mg, which is by far higher than that of most previous batteries and pouch Li-S cells. Impressively, with bending and even partial damage, the pouch cell can still work normally, showing considerable safety.

The surface morphology and structure of the VN/CA (VCA) composites, and the electrochemical performance of these composites based sulfur cathodes were investigated systematically. This mono-dispersed microsphere composite presents hierarchical pore and uniform dispersion of vanadium nitride, and effectively immobilizes the polysulfides due to the synergistic effects between the VN and CA matrix. Moreover, the VN on the CA has catalytic effect on the electrode reaction, displaying high discharge voltages. In particular, a higher initial discharge capacity of 1279 mAh g(-1) can be obtained at 0.2 C, and it retains 1001 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. Even at a higher rate of 1 C, the capacity still delivers 802 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, serious shuttle effects and sluggish reaction kinetics obstruct the practical implementation of Li-S batteries. Herein, a functional separator modified with polytetraphenylporphyrin cobalt adsorbed onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PTPPCo/MWCNT) was fabricated by a simple vacuum filtration method. Because of the excellent conductivity of the MWCNT as well as the enhanced chemical adsorption and powerful catalytic activity of PTPPCo, the shuttle effect was effectively suppressed and the reaction kinetics were greatly enhanced. Consequently, the Li-S cells with the modified functional separator PTPPCo/MWCNT showed a prominent initial reversible capacity of 1330 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.2C, enhanced rate performance, outstanding cycling stability (with a slight average capacity decay of 0.038% per cycle at 2C for 500 cycles), and excellent anti-self-discharge ability.

In this work, anionic oxygen vacancies in niobium oxide nanoparticle is fabricated on a high-conductive hierarchical porous nano-carbon as a sulfur anchor and lithium ion accelerator. As evidenced by optical coloration and electrochemical measurements, the oxygen-deficient electrocatalyst shows much stronger interaction ability to polysulfides and endows superior catalytic ability of propelling ion kinetics and facilitating the precipitation of Li2S. Theoretical simulations have also revealed that Nb-S bonds are formed when polysulfides interacts with AOV-Nb2O5-x catalyst. Consequently, the as-prepared sulfur cathode exhibits a high initial capacity of 1489 mA h g(-1), corresponding to the theoretical utilization of 89%, and a long life for 600 cycles at 1 C. Enhancing current rate to 5 C, a rate capacity of 899 mA h g(-1) is obtained, demonstrating rapid conversion kinetics. Impressively, even increasing the areal loading to 4.2 mg cm(-2) with the lean electrolyte, the pouch cell can still exhibit the initial areal capacity of 3.54 mA h cm(-2) at 0.343 mA cm(-2) and stabilize for several tens of cycles, providing the promise for fast-charge batteries.

Nevertheless, flexible Li-S batteries have unsatisfactory electrochemical performance owing to electrode fracture during repeated bending, the volume change of sulfur species and the severe shuttle effect. Binders play essential roles in these batteries but have always lacked attention. Herein, a self-healing polyvinylpyrrolidone-polyethyleneimine (PVP-PEI) binder cross-linked by hydrogen bonds, which also regulates polysulfide redox kinetics, is reported. The dynamic hydrogen-bonding networks repair the cracks and ensure the integrity of the electrode while numerous polar groups such as C(sic)O and -NH2 suppress the shuttle effect by immobilizing polysulfides. Therefore, Li-S batteries with the PVP-PEI binder exhibit excellent cycling stability (a capacity decay rate of 0.0718% per cycle at 1 C after 450 cycles), an outstanding areal capacity of 7.67 mAh cm(-2) even under a high sulfur loading (7.1 mg cm(-2)) and relatively lean electrolyte conditions (E/S ratio = 8 mu L mg(-1)). Flexible Li-S pouch cells using the PVP-PEI binder show a stable performance for 140 cycles and a favorable capacity retention of over 95% after 2800 bending cycles, confirming its application potential in high-performance flexible Li-S batteries.

Trapping and Redistribution of Hydrophobic Sulfur Sols in Graphene-Polyethyleneimine Networks for Stable Li-S Cathodes	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						cycle stability; graphene; hydrothermal; lithium-sulfur batteries; polyethyleneimine	LONG-LIFE; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; BATTERIES; OXIDE; NITROGEN; NANOCOMPOSITES; ELECTROLYTE; NANOSHEETS; SPHERES	The lithium-sulfur battery is a promising next-generation rechargeable battery system which promises to be less expensive and potentially fivefold more energy dense than current Li-ion technologies. This can only be achieved by improving the sulfur utilization in thick, high areal loading cathodes while minimizing capacity fading to realize high practical energy densities and long cycle-life. This study reports a simple method to fabricate a high capacity, high loading cathode with one of the highest cycle-stabilities reported. It is demonstrated that sulfur sols formed by crashing dissolved elemental sulfur into water are trapped between graphene oxide sheets when flocculated with polyethyleneimine. Low temperature, hydrothermal treatment produces a conductive, partially covalent composite exhibiting outstanding cycle-stability. Using this method, sulfur can be uniformly distributed at fractions as high as 75.7 wt%. Electrodes with high areal sulfur loadings (up to approximate to 5.4 mg cm(-2)), prepared using these composites, lead to projected high cell level practical energy densities of 400 Wh kg(-1). The electrodes demonstrate negligible capacity loss over 250 cycles at 0.15 C and only 0.028% capacity loss per cycle over 810 cycles at 0.75 C. Eventual capacity fading is found to be linked to degradation of lithium-metal anode suggesting that the cathode material remains stable over even more extended cycling.

Regulating the electronic structure of substrate materials could be an effective strategy to further modulate surface polysulfide adsorption and interface electron transfer for advanced Li-S batteries. Herein, a cobalt-doped vanadium nitride (Co-VN) microflower hierarchical structure with a 5% Co/V ratio was synthesized as a substrate material. Theoretical calculation indicated that the polysulfide adsorption energy of Co-VN (-5.04 eV) was enhanced compared to that of VN (-4.14 eV). Electrochemical experiments verified that the polarization and internal resistance of VN were lowed after Co doping. Electrochemical tests showed that the cyclic stability of the Co-VN/sulfur (Co-VN/S) composite cathode was greatly improved compared to the undoped one, achieving an impressive initial capacity of 706 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C and that the fading rate of discharge capacity over 500 cycles was only 0.034% per cycle. A discharge capacity of 873 mAh g(-1) under remarkable sulfur loading (4.42 mg cm(-2)) was also achieved with a capacity decay rate of 0.028% per cycle over 100 cycles.

Unfortunately, some technical obstacles hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries, such as the formation of polysulfide intermediates between the cathode and anode as well as the insulating nature of the sulfur cathode and other discharge products. Glass fiber (GF) separators provide some cavities to withstand the volume change of sulfur during cycling, leading to long-term cycling stability. Here, the application of polar materials with a novel liquid graphene oxide (L-GO) binder rather than the standard poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder as effective coatings on the GF separator of the Li-S cell has been developed to suppress the shuttle effect. The deposition of silicon dioxide (SiO2), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (PDAAQ) with the L-GO binder on the GF separator was investigated with a polycarboxylate-functionalized graphene (PC-FGF/S) cathode and a Li metal anode. The cells with modified coatings and L-GO as an efficient binder could accelerate conversion of long-chain polysulfides to short-chain polysulfides and significantly suppress the polysulfide dissolution, resulting in capacity retentions of similar to 1020, 1070, and 1190 mAh g(-1) for the cells with SiO2/L-GO-, TiO2/L-GO-, and PDAAQ/L-GO-coated separators after 100 cycles. The results demonstrate that ultrathin SiO2-, TiO2-, and PDAAQ-containing coatings with the L-GO binder on the GF separator can drastically improve the cyclability of the Li-S cells even after a long cycling life.

The obtained carbon was found to feature hierarchical pore structure, as evidenced by nitrogen sorption isotherm analysis. Composite sulfur-carbon electrode has been prepared using this carbon by means of simple dry-mixing technique and subjected to electrochemical testing in model Li-S cells with electrolyte being 0.5 M lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf) and 0.5 M lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in mixture of 1,2dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL). The Li-S cells assembled with obtained composite sulfur-carbon cathode demonstrated a large initial specific discharge capacity of about 829 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C current rate and delivered ca. 712 mA h g(-1) after subsequent 50 charge and discharge cycles, which corresponds to 86% capacity retention. Generally, the investigated Li-S cells have exhibited good cycling stability and excellent reversibility. Thus, the obtained waste-derived activated porous carbon can be considered as a promising component for the composite cathode material of Li-S batteries.

The NMO/RGO/S microsphere was developed by spray drying the NMO, GO, and S suspension followed by a hydrazine reduction process. The resulting hierarchical microsphere, constructed by cross-linked NMO nanorods and RGO sheet, shortens the electron/ion diffusion pathway. It also provides adequate void space to accommodate S and mitigate the volume variation during cycling. Additionally, the polar NMO nanorods offer strong chemical adsorption to lithium polysulfides, which was confirmed by adsorption experiment. Owing these features, the NMO/RGO/S electrode exhibited a high specific capacity and good cyclability as well. The initial discharge capacity is 952.8 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, and after 500 cycles, a discharge capacity of 520 mAh g(-1) is maintained, which corresponds to a capacity fading of 0.09% per cycle. The simple preparation method for the construction of NMO/RGO/S microsphere reported in the study advances the development of efficient cathode materials for Li/S battery.

This 3D nanocarbon-sulfur network combines three different nano carbons, as follows: zero dimensional carbon nanoparticle, one-dimensional carbon nanotube, and two-dimensional graphene. This 3D nano carbon-sulfur network is synthesized by using a method based on soluble chemistry of elemental sulfur and three types of nanocarbons in well-chosen solvents. The resultant sulfur-carbon material shows a high specific capacity of 1115 mA h g(-1) at 0.02C and good rate performance of 551 mA h g(-1) at 1C based on the mass of sulfur-carbon composite. Good battery performance can be attributed to the homogeneous compositing of sulfur with the 3D hierarchical hybrid nanocarbon networks at nanometer scale, which provides efficient multidimensional transport pathways for electrons and ions. Wet chemical method developed here provides an easy and cost-effective way to prepare sulfur-carbon cathode materials with high sulfur loading for application in high-energy Li-S batteries.

Catalysis, as a process optimization approach, offers an option to eliminate the intrinsic issues. However, exploring and understanding the role of catalysts on electrode reaction remains critical bottle-necks, particularly as they are prone to continuous evolution under complex dynamic environment. Herein, platinum nanoparticles loaded on MXene nanosheets, as sulfur host, and the action of catalysts on the reaction process are investigated via ex-situ monitors upon solid-liquid-solid chemical transformation of sulfur species. These traces confirm that the high performance originates from electron transfer between catalysts and LiPSs, which lowers the nucleation barrier from liquid LiPSs to solid Li2S/Li2S2. Further, the accelerated liquid-solid conversion can alleviate the accumulation of LiPSs, and boost the reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries. The findings corroborate the electronic modulation between catalysts and LiPSs, which is a generalizable strategy to optimize energy conversion efficiency of Li-S batteries.

For high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries, a dense electrode with low porosity is desired to minimize electrolyte intake, parasitic weight, and cost. Here we report the profound impact on the discharge polarization, reversible capacity, and cell cycling life of lithium-sulfur batteries by decreasing cathode porosities from 70 to 40%. According to the developed mechanism-based analytical model, we demonstrate that sulfur utilization is limited by the solubility of lithium-polysulfides and further conversion from lithium-polysulfides to Li2S is limited by the electronically accessible surface area of the carbon matrix. Finally, we predict an optimized cathode porosity to maximize the cell level volumetric energy density without sacrificing the sulfur utilization.

However, rapid capacity fading is a significant problem facing its practical realization. Here we present the fabrication of a sandwich structured electrode by confining elemental sulfur in a TiO2 nanocrystal (3-5 nm) decorated graphene nanosheet host (graphene/TiO2). Elemental sulfur occupies the inter-particle mesopores of the TiO2 nanocrystal layer and is in intimate contact with the graphene. The sandwich structured graphene/TiO2/S electrode exhibits enhanced cycling stability with high specific capacity and high Coulombic efficiency. The enhanced electrochemical performance is highly related to the well-defined sandwich structure and the in situ formation of a mixed ionic/electronic conductor (LixTiO2). The sandwich structure could favor rapid diffusion of the electrolyte during the charge-discharge process. Pore absorption of the graphene/TiO2 host and the on-site adsorption of the TiO2 nanocrystals could alleviate the dissolution and shuttling of the polysulfides. More importantly, the in situ formed LixTiO2 works synergistically with the highly conductive graphene layer to facilitate easier Li+/e(-) transport. The sandwich structure plus the unique functions of the graphene/TiO2 host conceptually provide new opportunities to achieve the long-term cycling stability of a sulfur electrode.

The rational design of composites consisting of transition metals and conductive nanocarbon is considered an effective strategy to construct cathode materials for Li-S batteries with excellent cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, we propose a spray drying method to fabricate 3D pomegranate-like titanium nitride (TiN)@graphene composites as hosts for sulfur cathodes. The hollow spheres are coated with graphene layers to form a shell, serving as a highly efficient electrochemical reaction chamber and a reservoir for polysulfides. The TiN@graphene/S electrode exhibits an excellent capacity of 810 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C. The cathodes with high areal sulfur loadings of 2.8 and 3.6 mg cm(-2) maintained remarkable capacities of 568 and 515 mA h g(-1), respectively, after 500 cycles. The TiN hollow spheres not only accommodate the large volume expansion of sulfur but also improve the conversion of polysulfides during the discharge/charge process. The excellent electrical conductivity of the few-layered graphene shell facilitates electron transport and maintains structural stability. This work offers a strategy to combine inorganic compounds and nanocarbon as sulfur hosts to improve the electrochemical properties of Li-S batteries.

The key to achieve a high performance electrode for Li-S battery lies in the arrangement of the building blocks into a well-designed structure, in which the nanocarbon framework not only acts as an electronic conduit to the encapsulated active materials but also serves as a mini-electrochemical reaction chamber. Therefore, a nanocomposite with sulfur entrapped into hierarchical porous graphene was proposed and fabricated for Li-S batteries. The nanocomposite electrode exhibits high discharging capacitance of 1068 and 543 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 and 10 C, respectively. The discharging capacity of 386 mA h g(-1) can be presented at ultra-low temperature of -40 degrees C, which far exceeds the operating range of conventional lithium-ion batteries. The large scale produced hierarchal graphene was mainly decorated with epoxy and hydroxyl groups, which can enhance the binding of S to the C-C bonds due to the induced ripples by the functional groups. These results provided a promising electrode material for energy storage device with high capacitance, which is important for the increasing demands of power sources in cold environments, such as battery systems for electric vehicles in cold zone or for aeronautic applications.

As sulfur ratio is 85% (w/w) in the composite, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation show that the moniliform particles with 10 nm sulfur shells preserve the morphology of carbon cores. Tested as the cathode material in a lithium cell with binary organic electrolyte at room temperature, the composite shows excellent electro-chemical performance. It exhibits a specific capacity up to 1232.5 mAh g(-1) at the initial discharge and its specific capacity remained above 800 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. Meanwhile, the composite also exhibits the high-rate behavior at 800 mA g(-1) of current density. Assuming a complete reaction to the final product. Li2S, the utilization of the electrochemically active sulfur is about 85% at the initial cycle. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is introduced to understand the impact of the microstructure of composite on electrochemistry.

However, the viable design of versatile interlayer to retard the shuttling effects and improve the sluggish kinetics is still a focus and paramount challenge. Herein, we present a tentacles-like metallic nickel-modified and nitrogen-doped carbon skeleton (NCS) to serve as adsorbent and catalyst in the lithium-sulfur battery (LSBs). The carbonized skeleton and derived carbon tubes jointly construct conductive networks and adequate ion pathways. Meanwhile, abundant metallic nickel nanoparticles synergistically build a multifunctional interface with polar networks for the fixation and conversion of polysulfides, giving rise to significant improvement of cyclic stability and reaction kinetics of LSBs. As a result, the Li-S batteries using NCS as an interlayer could possess superior electrochemical performance including cyclic stability, high specific capacity (1204.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, 998.7 mAh g(-1) at 1C), and good Coulombic efficiency. More importantly, even with the areal sulfur loading of up to 6.1 and 7.5 mg cm(-2), it still demonstrates superior electrochemical performance with the areal capacity of 4.2 and 5.9 mAh cm(-2) with steady cycling, respectively. In conclusion, we confirm this work provides a promising way to explore and expand the application of metal nanoparticles in interlayers for advanced Li-S batteries.

Galvanostatic discharge-charge tests show that the as-assembled Li-S battery could deliver a high discharge specific capacity of 1457 mA hg(-1) (based on the sulfur cathode) at 0.1 C, indicating the high Li electroactivity of the system. The reversible capacity is 926.4mA hg(-1) in the first cycle, and could remain as high as 670 mA hg(-1) after 50 cycles, revealing the favorable compatibility between the RTIL P1A3TESI electrolyte and the two electrode materials in the Li-S battery. The as-assembled Li-S battery in the charged state can be used for energy output without activation process by charging. This green rechargeable Li-S battery typically gives an output voltage of 1.5 V per cell, which raises the potential for directly replacing the widely used 1.5V primary alkaline batteries and dry cells without any change of external circuits of current electronic devices but more rechargeable and powerful.

In this work, Li2S is chemically anchored onto the surface of two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO), which is then tangled and connected by one-dimensional carbon nanotube (CNT) to promote electron transfer, and finally further embedded with PANI-derived carbon (PDC) to suppress a polysulfide shuttle. The deliberately designed carbon matrix offers a fast electron and ion transfer route, suitable surface area, void volume, and pore size for redox reactions and polysulfide confinement. Furthermore, PDC could synergistically immobilize polysulfides inside the cathode by means of chemisorption so as to restrain the shuttle effect in LSBs. Last but not least, PDC with a quinone-based structure could function as a redox mediator (RM) to facilitate Li2S oxidation with minimized polarization. Benefited from the aforementioned advantages, the as-fabricated Li2S-GO/CNT/PDC composite, which is coupled with a lithium metal as the anode, delivers initially a high specific capacity of 925 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and good retention capability of 550 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at 2 C. Therefore, the good electrochemical behavior of the Li2S-GO/CNT/PDC composite suggests its promising prospects for the commercial application of LSBs in high-energy storage devices.

However, its high sensitivity to moisture and oxygen makes time-consuming slurry-casting process not appropriate for Li2S cathode production. Herein, interconnected carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and porous carbon (PC) inlaid with Li2S (Li2S@PC@CNF) has been fabricated via a carbothermal reduction strategy by selecting a cost-effective and environmentally friendly precursor, i.e., bacterial cellulose (BC) hydrogel filled with glucose and Li2SO4. Self-supporting Li2S@PC@CNF could be directly applied as the cathode, thereby detouring the routinely needed slurry-casting procedure. CNFs serve as a network for electron transport and meanwhile a skeleton to support the free-standing Li2S@PC@CNF electrode, while PC seamlessly connects CNFs due to the initial hydrogen bonding between glucose and cellulose, providing physical confinement for lithium polysulfides and large interface area for electrochemical reaction. Thereby, due to its unique ferroconcrete-like architecture, Li2S@PC@CNF based LSBs delivers a high initial specific capacity of 700 mA h g(-1) with 500 mA h g(-1) retained after 400 cycles, and presents promising rate capability of 450 mA h g(-1) at 2 C.

As for quasi-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs), it is also very important to confine the shuttle effect and Li dendrite growth. Herein, we synthesize GPEs polymerized under ultraviolet, in which the poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoro propylene) (PVDF-HFP) is one of the polymer matrices to provide high ionic conductivity and toughness, pentaerythritol tetrakis-divinyl adipate (PETT-DA) is another polymer matrix to simultaneously suppress shuttle effect and lithium dendrite. More importantly, Li(6.4)ALa(3)Zr(1.4)ATa(0.6)O(12) (LLZTO) provides the Li. transport sites to facilitate the Li+ transport speed. Meanwhile, it can hinder the crystallization of polymers, reducing crystallinity of GPEs. Prominently, the designed GPEs with 10 wt% LLZTO have elevated ionic conductivity of 8.74 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) and Li* transference number of 0.69, accompanied with superb capacity retention of 88.6% after 300 cycles at 1C. Importantly, the excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability give more potentials to the commercialization of LSBs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Whereas, the shuttle effect of polysulfides limits the utilization of active materials, reducing the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, by directly using waste newspapers as a substrate, a waste newspaper/multi-walled carbon nanotube/TiO2(NMT) interlayer has been prepared for stable Li-S batteries. In the composite interlayer, the newspaper functions as the basic frame for loading materials. Carbon materials absorbed by the newspaper provide both a conductive pathway and physical adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPS). Meanwhile, TiO2 inhibits the dissolution of LiPS in the electrolyte by strong chemical bonding. The morphology and spectra prove that the newspaper plays a key frame role in the functional composite interlayer. The electrochemical analyses demonstrate that the as-fabricated interlayer can obviously improve the cycling performance of Li-S battery. At a 0.5 C (1.0 C = 1675 mA h g(-1)) charge-discharge current density, after 500 cycles, the Li-S battery with NMT interlayer still exhibits a discharge capacity of 463.7 mA h g(-1) with a low capacity decay per cycle of 0.071%.

In this work, the anchoring properties of single-sided modified Ca2NX and Y2CX and double-sided modified Ca2NX2 and Y2CX2 (X = H, O, F, Cl and S) in LiSBs were systematically studied by first principle calculation. The unmodified sides of Ca2NF, Y2CH, Y2CCl and Y2CS have a strong interaction with S8, but it will promote the decomposition of S8 and cause unnecessary loss of active materials. On the contrary, double-sided modified Ca2NCl2, Y2CF2 and Y2CCl2 have moderate adsorption energies for lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn) and S8. The decomposition barriers of Li2S on the surfaces of Ca2NCl2 and Y2CCl2 are significantly lower than that of natural Li2S, and Li+ has a rapid diffusivity on their surfaces. Therefore, Ca2NCl2 and Y2CCl2 can suppress the shuttle effect and improve the battery performance, which indicates they are ideal anchoring materials for LiSBs.

Here, a unique three-dimensional hollow reduced graphene oxide microsphere decorated with ZnO nanoparticles (3D-ZnO/rGO) is synthesized to decrease the dissolution of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) into the electrolyte. The chemical adsorption of ZnO on LiPS is combined with the physical adsorption of 3D-rGO microsphere to synergistically suppress the shuttle effect. The obtained 3D-ZnO/rGO can provide sufficient space for sulfur storage, and effectively alleviate the repeated volume changes of sulfur during the cycle. When the prepared S-3D-ZnO/rGO was used as the cathode in LSB, an initial discharge specific capacity of 1277 mAh g(-1)was achieved at 0.1 C. After 100 cycles, 949 mAh g(-1)can still be maintained. Even at 1 C, a reversible discharge specific capacity of 726 mAh g(-1)was delivered.

In our work, a titanium carbide - titanium dioxide/single-walled carbon nanotube/sulfur (TiC-TiO2/SWCNT/S) cathode with high conductivity and effective polysulfides adsorption is prepared by a facile method for fabricating Li-S batteries. The batteries with this composite cathode show a good performance at 0.1 C due to relatively high utilization of sulfur, reaching 1338.6 mAh.g(-1) specific capacity at first cycle and retaining 802.5 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, it presents an excellent rate performance with 711.2 mAh.g(-1) at 4 C, and recovers to 1006.9 mAh.g(-1) when the current returns to 0.1 C. Also a slow capacity decay (0.045% decay rate per cycle) is observed at 1 C. These results suggest that a small amount of SWCNT can increase the conductivity of the whole composite to a great extent, and the strong adsorption ability of TiO2 increases the cycle life. This work offers an efficient and low-cost strategy to obtain high performance batteries with great potential for commercial applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Possessing superior physical adsorption capacity and electrical conductivity, this functional carbon coating can act as a barrier to effectively intercept polysulfides and further improve the utilization of sulfur. This functionality greatly improves rate capability and cycle life. The initial discharge specific capacity of a lithium-sulfur battery with CNT/AC-coated separator could reach 1495.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. After 200 discharge/charge cycles, it can still deliver a reversible capacity of as high as 742 mAh g(-1) with a low fading rate of 0.25% per cycle. When the rate is increased to 1 C, the S cathode can still deliver a discharge capacity of 988.4 mAh g(-1) and retain the remaining capacity of 718 mAh g(-1) over 50 cycles.

The nitrogen-doped carbyne analogue was synthesized by the dehydrochlorination and polymerization of 1, 1, 2-trichloroethane and urea. The XPS characterization indicated that nitrogen atoms have been effectively doped into the carbon skeleton with a nitrogen content of 4.32 wt%, and the obtained N-CAS cathode has a porous structure with uneven pore width. The electrochemical results showed that the N-CAS cathode can deliver a high initial capacity (1570mAh/g at a current density of 200 mA/g) and rate capability (500mAh/g at 2000 mA/g), and after 300 cycles, it displays a reversible capacity as high as 900mAh/g in carbonic ester electrolyte, which are better than that of non-doped carbyne polysulfide. These results suggest that doped nitrogen have electrostatic interaction on the lithium polysulfides to improve electrochemical stability and accelerate redox dynamics.

A comparison was made between a glyme based electrolyte, which exhibits high polysulfide solubility, and a fluorinated ether based electrolyte, which was proposed to reduce the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides. A separate analysis was conducted on porous carbon cathodes and separators obtained from cycled battery cells. The determination of the species concentration trends allowed a deeper understanding of the differences in battery cell operating mechanism. We have determined that polysulfide species are formed in similar concentrations in both examined electrolytes, but they remain trapped in the cathode pores in the fluorinated ether based electrolyte lithium-sulfur battery cells. The polysulfide concentration in the separators of the fluorinated ether cells was below the limit of detection, which indicates that the solubilities of polysulfides in the fluorinated electrolyte are below 50 mu M. This results in absence of disproportionation or coproportionation reactions between the polysulfide species in solution. This different mechanism influences the change in length and potential of the voltage plateaus of the battery cells during galvanostatic cycling. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, sulfur-containing C-rich SiCN composites are processed from silicon carbonitride (SiCN) ceramics, synthesized at temperatures from 800 to 1100 degrees C. To embed sulfur in the porous SiCN matrix, an easy and scalable procedure, denoted as melting-diffusion method, is applied. Accordingly, sulfur is infiltrated under solvothermal conditions at 155 degrees C into pores of carbon-rich silicon carbonitride (C-rich SiCN). The impact of the initial porosity and microstructure of the SiCN ceramics on the electrochemical performance of the synthesized SiCN-sulfur (SiCN-S) composites is analysed and discussed. A combination of the mesoporous character of SiCN and presence of a disordered free carbon phase makes the electrochemical performance of the SiCN matrix obtained at 900 degrees C superior to that of SiCN synthesized at lower and higher temperatures. A capacity value of more than 195 mAh/g over 50 cycles at a high sulfur content of 66 wt.% is achieved.

We have fabricated a metal-organic framework-derived (MOF) Co9S8/S (cobalt sulfide/sulfur) modified separator in LSBs which displays highest durability and excellent performance. The material successfully suppresses polysulfide shuttling, which is a determining factor in the deterioration of performance and lifetime of a battery. The Co9S8/S material is derived from a Co-MOF. Its porosity and structural features make it an efficient material for capturing lithium polysulfides (LiPS), which is involved in chemical interactions with polarities within Co9S8/S. The kinetics of redox reactions involving LiPS are facilitated by the conductive properties of the material. A prolonged cycle life of 2000 charge-discharge cycles at a 1 C-rate is observed when Co9S8/S is applied to the surface of a separator in the LSBs. An excellent discharge capacity of 879 mAh g(-1) with the coulombic efficiency being maintained above 85 % throughout the course of 2000 charge-discharge cycles at a 1 C-rate is achieved. Our strategy results in a material with unpresented high stability and durability of a MOF-derived material which have fundamental importance in industrial and future commercialization of LSBs.

Herein, a novel facile strategy, utilizing potassium ferrate (K2FeO4), to fulfill the synchronous carbonization and iron carbide (Fe3C) doping of folium cycas to prepare Fe3C nano-particles/porous biochar (Fe3C/PB) composite materials is proposed. The as-prepared Fe3C/PB samples possess a porous structure with a large specific surface area (2732.3 m(2) g(-1)) and a cumulative pore volume of 1.6 cm(3) g(-1), in which Fe3C plays a key role in electronic transmission, LiPSs adsorption and conversion in Li-S battery. After sulfur infusion, the Fe3C/PB@S composite with 69.6 wt% sulfur loading exhibits the highest initial discharge capacity of 1347.7 mA h g(-1) at the rate of 1 C. It is stable at 837.6 mA h g(-1) after 5 cycles, and is capable to maintain at 555.3 mA h g(-1) even after 250 cycles. The rational design of porous structural biochar materials with Fe3C doping is of great significance to achieve low-cost, green and large-scale production to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery and promote the industrial applications.

Considering the limitation of lithium ion batteries in energy density, lithium-sulfur batteries hold the promise to be the next generation of high energy density battery systems. Despite the great efforts devoted to exploring the cathode building block units based on nanocarbon materials, the rational design of the flexible cathode scaffold is still a challenge. Herein, we demonstrated the rational design of a sulfur cathode based on interlinked all-carbon scaffolds. Long carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were employed to form highly efficient conductive networks and MgO-templated carbon nanocages were used as building blocks for sulfur accommodation. The graphene-based carbon nanocages were directly generated and welded in the CNT networks. Electrochemical evaluation indicates that the rationally-designed structure endows the sulfur cathode with a high specific capacity and rate performance. The initial discharge capacity of the electrode reaches up to 1354 mAh g(-1) at 0.34 A g(-1). Even at a current density of 8.35 A g(-1), a reversible capacity of 750 mAh g(-1) can still be preserved, which is 70% of that at 0.84 A g(-1). Such a versatile method for the construction of electrode scaffolds shows potential for flexible electrodes in high performance lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors.

However, they still suffer from severe capacity fading and moderate rate capability. Herein, we provide rational design and controllable fabrication of highly uniform flower-like hierarchical carbon nanospheres (FCNS) for sulfur accommodation for lithium/sulfur battery cathodes. The as-prepared three dimension FCNS with a size of around 200 nm seem to be assembled by petal-like carbon nanosheets with a thickness of about 4 nm, forming many mesoporous channels, which lead to their high surface area and large pore volume. With such a tailor-made structure, FCNS/sulfur composite cathodes with high sulfur-loading (81 wt%) deliver high specific capacity, long cycling life and excellent rate capability. Particularly, N-doped flower-like carbon nanospheres (NFCNS) with higher surface area (1223 m(2) g(-1)) and larger pore volume (2.33 cm(3) g(-1)) are also fabricated by treating with NH3 and used to host sulfur in lithium-sulfur battery cathodes, exhibiting more excellent rate capability (829 mA h g(-1) at 5C) and cycling stability with a decay of 0.03% per cycle over 200 cycles at 1C. Even though the area density is improved to 2.5 mg sulfur per cm(2), the battery still has a decay of 0.056% per cycle over 200 cycles.

We incorporated them into electrode and interlayer in Li-Sulfur batteries. First, we controlled pore size and distributions in mesoporous carbon fibers (mpCNF) via adding polymethyl methacrylate as a sacrificial polymer to the polyacrylonitrile carbon precursor, followed by varying activation conditions. Secondly, nitrogen groups were introduced via cyclization of PAN on mesoporous carbon nanofibers (mpCPAN). We compared the synergistic effects of all these features in cathode substrate and interlayer on the performance Li-Sulfur batteries and used various characterization tools to understand them. Our results revealed that coating CPAN on both mesoporous carbon cathode and interlayer greatly enhanced the rate capability and capacity retention, leading to the capacity of 1000 mAh/g at 2 C and 1200 mAh/g at 0.5 C with the capability retention of 88% after 100 cycles. The presence of nitrogen groups and mesopores in both cathodes and interlayers resulted in more effective polysulfide confinement and also show more promise for higher loading systems.

Carbon-based substrates gained recently increasing interest as alternative to conventional aluminum substrate. We show herein that cells based on sulfur-graphene composite reveal higher reversible capacity and lower polarization using carbon-based support rather than the typical aluminum current collector. The enhancement of cell performances is attributed to a decrease of electrode-electrolyte interphase resistance promoted by the use of carbon-support, as detected by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) upon cyclic voltammetry (CV). This beneficial effect is ascribed to an improved contact of the active material particles with the support, and to increased electrode/electrolyte wetting due to its porosity and chemical nature, which are detected by Hg porosimetry, N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, SEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Therefore, the results reported in this work may be of interest for setting-up the most suitable condition for achieving high performance Li/S battery.

In this study, three- dimensional ( 3D) graphene/ S hybrid ( G/ S) is prepared by a one- pot hydrothermal method together with redox reaction between S- based compound and graphene oxide ( GO). G/ S has a three dimensional porous structure, where graphene is interconnected with each other forming a 3D conductive network. It demonstrates that the pore structure of G/ S can be well controlled by optimizing the drying method of the 3D graphene- based materials. Freeze drying and evaporation-induced drying can induce different density and pore structure of G/ S. Electrochemical tests illustrate that the resulting hybrid can deliver a specific capacity of 891 mAh center dot g(-1) and 575 mAh center dot g(-1) for the 1st and 100th cycle at a current density of 500 mAh center dot g(-1).

Presently, however, high specific capacities do not translate to high specific energies, mainly because of the electrolyte excess, which does not meet the required "lean electrolyte" condition. We introduce a separator that requires a minimal amount of electrolyte, 4.5 mu L mg(-1), for successful cycling of practical sulfur cathodes. Taking advantage of the self-assembly chemistry of polyelectrolyte complexation, we synthesized a tailored porous nanoparticle, which because of its amphiphilicity, is able to form a submicron coating on the low-surface energy Celgard separator by dip-coating. The tuned pore-size in the range of 1.5-2 nm, abundance of functional groups, and unprecedented adsorption capacity toward LiPS allows the polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticle decorated (PPX) separator to function as an efficient LiPS modulator, while uniquely maintaining lean electrolyte conditions and excellent transport properties. The PPX separator enabled a cell with capacity of 1348 mAh (5.12 mAh cm(-2)) at 0.2 C. Achieving the challenging trade-off between high capacity and lean electrolyte, we were able to attain high energy density in a pouch cell prototype with an initial capacity of 1218 mAh g(-1) and an energy density of 250 Wh kg(-1).

Although various materials as sulfur hosts can improve the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries, expensive raw materials, complex synthesis and lower sulfur loading impede their practical application. Herein, ultrafine Ti4O7 nanoparticle-embedded porous carbon (PC@Ti4O7) as an efficient sulfur host was facilely prepared using commercial TiO2 nanoparticles and phenolic resin. In this strategy, the highly conductive ultrafine Ti4O7 nanoparticles with abundant active adsorption sites can efficiently trap polysulfides and accelerate their conversion. In addition, the size of the Ti4O7 nanoparticles, depending on the commercial TiO2 nanoparticles, could be easily controlled. Moreover, the sufficient interspaces around the Ti4O7 nanoparticles are beneficial for maximizing the confinement of polysulfides. The hybrid cathode exhibits excellent cycling stability at a high rate of 4C over 1000 cycles. Particularly, the electrode with a sulfur loading of up to 15.6 mg cm(-2) retains an ultrahigh areal capacity of 8.6 mA h cm(-2) at 0.3C over 100 cycles. The low-cost and facile preparation of the PC@Ti4O7 composite provides new insight for the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Here we propose a novel templated spherical coassembly strategy to fabricate the MoS 2 /C hollow spheres as an efficient sulfur host material. The unique hollow structure provides enough interior space for accommodating a substantial amount of sulfur, and effectively suppresses the diffusion of dissolved polysulfides by both physical confinement and chemical adsorption. Moreover, the ionic transport as well as the ability to mitigate volume variation upon cycling is also improved, thereby maximizing the utilization of sulfur. Owing to these merits, when evaluated as a sulfur host for lithiumsulfur batteries, the MoS 2 /C hollow spheres exhibit appealing electrochemical performance with an impressive specific capacity of 1082 mA h g -1 at 0.1 C, excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability with a low fading rate of 0.04% per cycle.

By simple stirring mixing of the resultant MWNT suspension with nano-sulfur aqueous suspension, a novel porous sulfur/multiwalled carbon nanotube composite (S/MWNT) was synthesized. This preparation method based on the suspension mixing possesses the advantages of simplicity and low cost. Homogeneous dispersion and integration of MWNT in the composite results in a porous, highly conductive and mechanically flexible framework with enhanced electronic conductivity and ability to absorb the polysulfides into its porous structure. The cell with this S/MWNT composite cathode demonstrates a high reversibility, resulting in a stable reversible specific discharge capacity of 708 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Furthermore, the S/MWNT composite cathode with sulfur content of 62.5 wt% exhibits a good rate capability with discharge capacities of 946, 780 and 516 mAh g(-1) at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 C, respectively.

This polymer can be instantaneously carbonized into highly conductive carbon, which can then be used as both an immobilizer host and conductivity enhancer for sulfur cathodes. The cathode material of S/PAB-C was prepared via a rapid dissolution-precipitation method combined with an in situ and instantaneous carbonization process to obtain 3D graphene-like PAB-C with an artificial honeycomb-like morphology. Benefitting from this particular design, the S/PAB-C cathode with an optimal content of 75% sulfur exhibits excellent discharge-charge performance, which shows initial discharge capacities of 1449 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and 1087 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C, and retains a stable capacity of 900 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles with a high retention of 82.6% at 0.5C. The strategy which utilizes instantaneous carbonization of PAB and an in situ sulfur trapping process offers a new way to enhance the cycling stability and enriches the architectural design of LSBs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the brand new methodology to in situ synthesize highly conductive carbon for application in LSBs.

J	Song, Y; Ren, J; Wu, GY; Zhang, WL; Zhang, CW; Yin, FX				Song, Yan; Ren, Jun; Wu, Guoyan; Zhang, Wulin; Zhang, Chengwei; Yin, Fuxing			High capacity and rate capability of S/3D ordered bimodal mesoporous carbon cathode for lithium/sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH			English	Article						mesoporous materials carbon; ordered bimodal mesopores; lithium/sulfur battery	HIERARCHICAL POROUS CARBON; SULFUR BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITES; SHRINKAGE; TEMPLATE; CRYSTALS	3D ordered bimodal mesoporous carbon (OBMC) with a high specific surface area of 1368.7 m(2)/g, ordered large mesopores, and small mesopores on the walls is prepared by a surfactant-free rapid method using SiO2 nanosphere arrays as templates. The resulting OBMC is then composited with sulfur to prepare S/OBMC hybrids via a simple solution infiltration method followed by a heat treatment process. In S/OBMC composite, sulfur is uniformly infiltrated inside the 3D hierarchical pores of OBMC. On the basis of this systematic design, the obtained S/OBMC cathode shows a large discharge capacity value of 1590 mA h/g at first cycle and maintains 989 mA h/g after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Furthermore, at 1 C charge-discharge rate, a reversible discharge capacity of 733 mA h/g after 100 cycles is reached. The extraordinary electrochemical property of S/OBMC derives from the unique bimodal mesoporous structure with large mesopores and small mesopores that can facilitate the mass transfer and strict dissolution of polysulfide species into the electrolyte.

The experimental observations reveal that the lithiothermic reaction of loaded Ag2S with molten Li and the capillary effect of carbon cloth matrix improve the Li wettability of Ag2S@CC. Benefiting from the miscibility of nano-Ag and Li on the carbon fibers, the Li/Ag@CC can effectively induce the uniform stripping/plating behavior of Li to inhibit dendrite growth, resulting in a long lifetime over 2000h with low voltage hysteresis and fluctuation. Furthermore, the S parallel to Li/Ag@CC full battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 5.4 mAh cm(-2) and stable cycling performance for 200 cycles.

However, sp(3)-like defect structure, a combination of high strength and conduction of graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rarely reported. Herein, 3D neural-like hybrids of graphene (from reduced graphene oxide) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been integrated via sp3like defect structure by a hydrothermal approach. The sp(3)-like defect structure endows 3D nanocarbon hybrids with an enhanced carrier transfer, high structural stability, and electrocatalytic durability. The neural-like structure is shown to demonstrate a cascade effect of charges and significant performances regarding bio-electrocatalysis and lithium-sulfur energy storage. The concept and mechanism of "sp(3)-like defect structure" are proposed at an atomic/nanoscale to clarify the generation of rational structure as well as the cascade electron transfer.

The small amount of active reactant phloroglucinol promotes synthesis of carbon aerogel (CA) and formation of uniform and porous carbon spheres. The CA-Sm composites present an interlinked porous structure and high specific surface area. The CA-Sm with sulfur loading (CA/S-Sm) from the composite via molten sulfur technique exhibits an enhanced performance with long-term cycling stability and high rate capacity. In particular, the cathode of CA/S-Sm-2 with Sm/C molar ratio of 2/400 achieved a high initial discharge capacity of 1347 and 976 mAh g (1) at 0.2C and 2C, respectively. And the cathode exhibited a nice long-term cycling stability with a high initial discharge capacity of 1175 mAh g (1) and maintained 861 mAh g (1) after 300 cycles at 0.5C. The excellent electrochemical performance of the battery is attributed to interrelated nanospheres, porous carbon structure, large specific surface area of Sm2O3-doped CA composites and improved electronic and ionic transport at the cathode.

Raman spectroscopy shows that long-chain polysulfides (S-8(2-)) were formed via S8 ring opening in the first reduction process at similar to 2.4 V vs Li/Li+ and short-chain polysulfides such as S4(2-), S-4(-), S-3(-), and S2O42- were observed with continued discharge at similar to 2.3 V vs Li/Li+ in the second reduction process. Elemental sulfur can be reformed in the end of the charge process. Rate constants obtained for the appearance and disappearance polysulfide species shows that short-chain polysulfides are directly formed from S8 decomposition. The rate constants for S8 reappearance and polysulfide disappearance on charge were likewise similar. The formation of polysulfide mixtures at partial discharge was found to be quite stable. The CS2 additive was found to inhibit the sulfur reduction mechanism allowing the formation of long-chain polysulfides during discharge only and stabilizing the S-8(2-) product.

Graphene-Modified Electrodeposited Dendritic Porous Tin Structures as Binder Free Anode for High Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Co-electrodeposition; Sn/G composite; Sandwich-type electrode; Sulfur/carbon composite; Lithium-Sulfur battery	CARBON NANOPARTICLES; REVERSIBLE CAPACITY; SN; COMPOSITE; NANOCOMPOSITE; EFFICIENCY; OXIDE; FABRICATION; NANOSHEETS; NANOTUBES	In this paper, we report a novel Sn/G/RGO-S battery with high capacity and good cycle life in comparison to conventional lithium-ion batteries. Low cost electroplating and drop cast method are developed for the first time to prepare binder free highly porous 3D Sn/G/RGO composite on carbon paper substrate as anode. The unique 3D porous network of Sn/G composite allows better accommodation of volume expansion induced by Li insertion, while presence of graphene in the co-electrodeposited Sn/G composite provides enhanced electron conduction. Additional coating of RGO on the surface of co-electrodeposited Sn/G composite protects the electrode surface from the direct electrolyte contact, and minimizes the progressive SEI formation during repeated charge-discharge cycles. Consequently, Sn/G/RGO electrode in half-cell exhibits a much superior electrochemical performance and better cycle life. We also demonstrate a full-cell by using S/C as cathode and Sn/G/RGO composite with a very thin lithium foil on the surface as anode in order to avoid serious safety issues allied with lithium metal. Sn/G/RGO-S full cell delivers a high discharge capacity of 413 mAh g(-1) at the end of 40 cycles. The cell delivers a specific energy of about 660 Wh kg(-1) based on the weight of sulfur and 336 wh kg(-1) based on the total mass of the S/C electrode. The simple designed and cost effective technique to fabricate high performance Sn/G/RGO-S battery would be feasible for alternative clean energy sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To address such issues, we designed and synthesized a porous carambola-like N,S-doped carbon framework embedded with Mo2C particles (designed as N,S-Mo2C/C-ACF) as the interlayer material to block the polysulfide shuttle and it behaves as a catalytic mediator for LiPS conversion. The modified separator of polypropylene functionalized by N,S-Mo2C/C-ACF, showing ultrafast wetting ability to the electrolyte and high lithium ion (Li+) conductivity, proves to be highly effective for inhibiting the polysulfide shuttle and simultaneously promoting the reutilization of adsorbed LiPSs. When used in Li-S batteries by coupling with a Super P/sulfur cathode, over a wide temperature range of 5-55 degrees C, the as-fabricated batteries delivered excellent rate capability and long cycle stability. Especially, at a high rate of 5 C, the discharge capacities of 405, 630, and 670 mA h g(s)(-1) were achieved when tested at 5, 30, and 55 degrees C, respectively. The remarkable wide temperature performance is appealing for extended practical application of Li-S batteries.

The results showed that both an appropriate poristy and high level of S doping lead to the excellent electrochemical performance. The optimal HPC-Na-900/S composite exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance as cathode materials for Li-S batteries. Specially, the electrochemical performances of the resultant HPC/S composites change randomly with the surface area, pore volume except porosity and surface chemistry under the testing conditions. The porosity plays a more important role than surface area as well as pore volume which are the crucial parameters in designing of porous carbon, and only the ratio of these hierarchical pores reaches a specific range, the best battery performance can be achieved. The introduction of heteroatom are also key factors that determines the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.

The examined process is evaluated concerning its stress mechanism and its influence on the properties of the resulting composite materials. The architecture of the composites can be described as a core-shell structure, whose size and strength depend on the expended stress input from the mixing process. The comparison of electrodes from these composite particles with a reference cathode based on pure carbon black proves an increase in the energy density of approximately 30%. Furthermore, using the composite particles, a higher amount of additional carbon black enables an increase in the specific capacity of approximately 25% due to the improvement of the mechanical properties of the coating.

A sulfur host for loading Co4N nanoparticles into porous carbon has been designed as the cathode for high-performance Li-S batteries. The porous carbon successfully confines sulfur and Co4N in the pores, and the synergistic effect of physical and chemical adsorption can effectively inhibit the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides. Besides, the Co4N nanoparticles can also catalyze the redox reaction kinetics. At a current density of 0.5 C, S@KJ-Co4N cathodes deliver a high specific discharge capacity of 958.3 mAh g(-1) and retain at 784.0 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, corresponding to a decay rate of 0.09% per cycle. It is believed that this work can provide a promising strategy for the design of many energy storage systems.

However, the insulating sulfur and the shuttling effect concerning lithium polysulfides always persecute the sulfur cathode of Li-S batteries. Consequently, a globular polypyrrole (PPy) interlayer (GPIL) with multifunctional polysulfide-blocking ability wraps the carbon aerogel/sulfur cathode to restrain this shuttling effect. Ultimately, a high-performance Li-S battery is obtained through a polypyrrole coating design. The maximum discharge specific capacity of the sulfur cathode with a GPIL is 882 mAh g(-1) at 1.4 mA cm(-2) with the reversible specific capacity and an average Coulombic efficiency of similar to 652.7 mAh g(-1) and 98.1%, respectively, after 100 cycles, indicating an effective impediment of the shuttling effect. Moreover, the Li-S battery with a GPIL can still deliver 520 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention rate of >96% after 100 cycles at a high current density of 2.8 mA cm(-2), significantly outstripping most of the interlayers recently reported. This work highlights the meaning of this multifunctional interlayer and also promotes the great application potential of carbon aerogel as the host of the sulfur cathode for Li-S batteries.

However, both structural change and drastic phase transfer arising from irreversible and unstable conversion between S/Li2S and polysulfides during cycling would lead rapid capacity decay and short cycle-life for lithium-sulfur battery. Herein, inspired by such principle of zippers, a self-healing zipperlike sulfur electrode was designed, which was fabricated by organo-polysulfide (-S-x-) polymer binder (PSPEG) and sulfur nanocomposite with organo-polysulfide (-S-x-) chains grafted on carbon host (CPS/S). The organopolysulfide (-S-x -) chains on/in the carbon host or binder can not only function as redox mediator to control phase transfer between S/Li2S and polysulfides but also act as "zipper teeth" and "zipper sliders" respectively to repair the electrode spontaneously as the sulfur electrode suffered from mechanical damages and cracks. Owing to this unique zipper-like electrode design, the structural collapse and the agglomeration of S/Li2S were effectively suppressed. Consequently, the sulfur electrode exhibits both high capacity and excellent cycling stability, showing a specific capacity of 812 mA h g(-1) at 1.0 C after 300 cycles. Moreover, as the sulfur loading was increased to 7.6 mg cm(-2), the CPS/S + PSPEG electrode can still deliver a high areal capacity of 6.47 mA h cm(-2) with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (4.5:1, mu L:mg) after 60 cycles, which verifies the feasibility of the zipper-like electrode design.

A dual-spatially-confined reservoir for sulfur by wrapping microporous carbon with dense graphene, micro@meso-porous DSC (dual-spatial carbon), is synthesized to solve this issue. Such a structure is prepared through two distinctive methods: graphene promoted in situ hydrothermal carbonization of organics to grow micropores on itself, and liquid mediated drying of graphene hydrogel to form mesoporous graphene frameworks. In contrast to previously reported hierarchical carbon/S, the inner micropores are mainly responsible for loading sulfur, which could help confine its particle size, thus increasing the electrical/ionic conductivity and the utilization of sulfur, and restrain lithium polysulfide dissolution because of strong interaction with pore walls; while the outer mesopores act as another reservoir to stabilize the overflowed polysulfide and to enhance the Li+ transport. The S-micro@meso-porous DSC cathode exhibits better discharge capacity and cycling performance than S-microporous AC and S-micro@macro-porous DSC, i.e., 59% and 37% higher capacity remaining at 0.5 C than the latter two, respectively.

However, their practical applications have been hindered by several challenges, induding poor conductivity of S and its intermediates, shuttle effects of polysulfides, Li dendrite growth, etc. Tremendous efforts have been taken to tackle these issues by developing functional S host materials, separators and interlayers, solid-state electrolytes, etc., during the past decade. Compared to structurally complicated materials and intricate preparation approaches, electrospun nanofibers have obtained tremendous interests since they have played an extremely crucial role in improving the overall performance of Li-S cells due to their unique features such as easy-setup, substantial surface area, outstanding flexibility, high porosity, excellent mechanical properties, etc. In this Account, we highlight the advancements and progress of electrospun nanofibers applied for obtaining advanced Li-S batteries based on our research: from the traditional liquid system to a full solid-state cell. It starts with the fundamental electrochemistry and challenges of Li-S batteries and then focuses on the advantages of utilizing electrospun nanofibers in Li-S batteries and their working mechanisms, which are detailed from five perspectives: (i) cathode design; (ii) interlayers; (iii) separators; (iv) solid-state electrolytes; (v) Li anode protection. For example, we will discuss (1) how the appropriate nanofiber cathode designs improve the electrical conductivity and utilization of the cathode, (2) how nanofiber interlayers minimize the diffusion of polysulfides, (3) how nanofiber separators improve cells' rate capability, (4) how nanofiber-based solid-state electrolytes boost the overall ionic conductivity, accelerating the use of Li-S cells, and (5) how the applications of nanofibers suppress the Li dendrite growth. In the end, the critical research directions needed and the remaining challenges to be addressed are summarized. It is expected that this Account would provide an understanding of the importance for achieving advanced Li-S cells via utilizing electrospun nanofibers, inspiring extensive research on their rational designs and promoting the development of this field.

In order to make Li-S batteries more competitive, combination of trapping sites and electrocatalytic properties for polysulfides is an effective way to improve the battery performance. In this study, we prepare a type of multifunctional V3S4-nanowire/graphene composites (V3S4-G) by uniformly dispersing V3S4 nanowires on the graphene substrate. This structure contributes to the sufficient exposure of multifunctional V3S4 active sites which can anchor polysulfides and accelerate reaction kinetics. Thus, the Li-S batteries based on the multifunctional V3S4-G sulfur cathode deliver a stable cycling performance and good rate capability. Even at sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2), the V3S4-G sulfur cathode possesses a low capacity decay rate of 0.186% per cycle at 0.5 C.

Here, a novel sulfur-polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPS) copolymer is synthesized by one-step thermal polymerization. The break and recombination of C??O lead to the formation of PVPS, which is proved by various characterizations. Due to the strong chemical confinement of C?S bond, the excellent polysulfides adsorption ability of PVP with abundant polar bonds (such as C?O and C?N) and the improved charge transfer of PVPS, 20PVPS combining with PVP-modified separator as ?residence? of polysulfides delivers the high reversible capacity of 1079 and 729 mAh g-1 at 0.1 and 2 C and a slow capacity fading rate of 0.093% over 500 cycles at 1 C. These findings provide a reference for the synthesis of low-cost, biocompatible and highperformance sulfur-rich copolymer in lithium-sulfur battery.

A highly efficient polysulfide mediator for lithium-sulfur batteries	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; CATHODES; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; DEPOSITION; POROSITY; SURFACE; HYBRID; OXIDE; XPS	The lithium-sulfur battery is receiving intense interest because its theoretical energy density exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries at much lower cost, but practical applications are still hindered by capacity decay caused by the polysulfide shuttle. Here we report a strategy to entrap polysulfides in the cathode that relies on a chemical process, whereby a host-manganese dioxide nanosheets serve as the prototype-reacts with initially formed lithium polysulfides to form surface-bound intermediates. These function as a redox shuttle to catenate and bind 'higher' polysulfides, and convert them on reduction to insoluble lithium sulfide via disproportionation. The sulfur/manganese dioxide nanosheet composite with 75 wt% sulfur exhibits a reversible capacity of 1,300mAh g(-1) at moderate rates and a fade rate over 2,000 cycles of 0.036%/cycle, among the best reported to date. We furthermore show that this mechanism extends to graphene oxide and suggest it can be employed more widely.

Comparing with the currently existing sulfur impregnation method, this facile one-pot method is proved to be energy-saving and time-saving, to have a sulfur content that is exactly controllable and to be environment-friendly. In the hydrothermal environment, sulfur would selectively diffuse into the pores of carbon hosts due to its high mobility, homogeneous dispersibility, hydrophobicity and carbon affinity. As a result, the S/C composite obtained from hydrothermal-assisted method under a low temperature of 120 degrees C and a short time of 2 hours exhibits a comparable battery performance to that obtained from the traditional melting method under 155 degrees C for 20 hours, which reached 1239 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and 796 mA h g(-1) at even 1C between 1.85-2.8 V, being rather suitable for large-scale manufacture and commercial development.

Herein, we discuss the influence of sulfur content and distribution onto the N and O co-doped hierarchically porous biomass carbon matrix (PC) to achieve high specific capacitance and cycling stability. Sulfur encapsulated PC was prepared from an eco-friendly source with a high surface area of 2065 m(2)g(-1) and a pore volume of 1.5 cm(3)g(-1). PC with 54, 68 & 73% of sulfur content (PCSCs) have been investigated as cathode materials for Li-S battery. PC with 54% sulfur displayed better performance with an initial discharge capacity of 1606 mA hg(-1) and a cycling stability of 1269 mA hg(-1) at 0.1C rate after 100 cycles due to better dispersion of sulfur in the porous architecture. The higher cycling stability of PCSC (54%) is due to the N and O co-doped hierarchical porous carbon layers, enhancing the sulfur utilization ratio and mitigating the polysulfide shuttle during the cycling process.

Lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery has attracted much attention owing to its high theoretical energy density and abundance, but many challenges such as rapid capacity fade and low sulfur loading and utilization have impeded its practical use. Here, we present a free-standing TiO2 nanowire/graphene hybrid membrane for Li/dissolved polysulfide batteries with high capacity and long cycling life. Graphene membrane with high electrical conductivity is used as a current collector to effectively reduce the internal resistance in the sulfur cathode and physically immobilize the dissolved lithium polysulfides. The TiO2 nanowires introduced into the graphene membrane offer a hierarchical composite structure, in which the TiO2 nanowires not only have strong chemical binding with the lithium polysulfides, but also show a strong catalytic effect for polysulfide reduction and oxidation, promoting a fast redox reaction kinetics with high capacity and low voltage polarization. This hybrid electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 1327 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C rate, a Coulombic efficiency approaching 100%, high-rate performance of 850 mA h g(-1) at 2 C rate, and long cyclic stability with a capacity of 1053 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C rate over 200 cycles, demonstrating great prospect for application in high energy Li-S batteries.

We show that noble metal nanoparticles are useful for tuning the properties of cathode materials. On one hand, the surface chemistry of the metals enhances the polysulfide anchoring strength involved in carbon-based Li-S electrode cycling batteries. On the other hand, the metallic nanoparticles' nucleation and growth decreases the carbonaceous foam's mesoporosity appearing, at first glance, as a penalty. The Au@C-HIPE(80HF) sample shows a capacity for the first discharge at 327 mA h cm(-3) decreasing to 182 mA h cm(-3) after 50 cycles, corresponding, respectively, to 430 and 240 mA h g(-1). The most efficient sample in terms of power density per mass, C-HIPE(2P5HF), exhibits a capacity for the first discharge at 202 mA h cm(-3) decreasing to 150 mA h cm(-3) after 50 cycles (respectively 1680 and 1000 mA h g(-1)). Hence, considering the capacity retention, the most interesting sample (C-HIPE(2P5HF)), if power density per weight is taken as the main criteria of choice, becomes one of the least efficient if we consider power density per volume. This work further demonstrates the importance of normalizing the power density not only by weight (mA h g(-1)) but also by volume (mA h cm(-3)) in order to provide absolute and comparable energy storage capabilities from one sample to another.

The aligned structure and the presence of interconnected micro voids/channels in the 3-D FLG/PrGO-S electrodes serves as template not only for the high sulfur loading (up to 80 wt%, areal loading of 1.2mg cm(-2)) but also compensates for the volume changes occurring during charge-discharge cycles. The inter-connectivity of the electrode system further facilitates fast electronic and ionic transport pathways. Consequently, the binder-free 3-D FLG/PrGO-S electrodes display a high first-cycle capacity (1320 mA h g(-1) at C/20), along with excellent rate capability of similar to 830mA h g(-1) and 700 mA h g(-1) at 2C and 5C rates, respectively. The residual functional groups of PrGO (-OH, -C-O-C-and -COOH) facilitate fast and reversible capture of Li+ ions while confining the polysulfide shuttles, thus, contributing to excellent cycling capability and retention capacity. The 3D electrodes demonstrate excellent capacity retention of similar to 80% (1040 mA h g(-1) at C/10) over 350 charge-discharge cycles. Comparatively, the 2-D planar PrGO-S electrodes displayed poor electronic conductivity and can only provide 560 mA h g(-1) after 150 cycles, thereby further highlighting the vital role of the electrode morphology in improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

A Comprehensive Approach toward Stable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with High Volumetric Energy Density	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article							IMPROVED CYCLE-LIFE; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; CARBON COMPOSITES; POLAR HOST; CATHODE; GRAPHENE; ELECTRODE; NITROGEN; REDOX; POLYSULFIDES	A comprehensive approach is reported to construct stable and high volumetric energy density lithium-sulfur batteries, by coupling a multifunctional and hierarchically structured sulfur composite with an in-situ cross-linked binder. Through a combination of first-principles calculations and experimental studies, it is demonstrated that a hybrid sulfur host composed by alternately stacking graphene and layered graphitic carbon nitride embraces high electronic conductivity as well as high polysulfide adsorptivity. It is further shown that the cross-linked elastomeric binder empowers the hierarchical sulfur composites-multi-microns in size-with the ability to form crack-free and compact high-loading electrodes using traditional slurry processing. Using this approach, electrodes with up to 14.9 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading and an extremely low electrolyte/ sulfur ratio as low as 3.5: 1 mu L mg(-1) are obtained. This study sheds light on the essential role of multifaceted cathode design and further on the challenges facing lithium metal anodes in building high volumetric energy density lithium-sulfur batteries.

One of their major technical problems is the sulfur active material loss and significant volume change during the charge-discharge process, resulting in rapid capacity fading. Here, we propose sulfur-inserted polymer-anchored edge exfoliated graphite as a positive electrode to accommodate the conflicting requirement of physically restraining sulfur dissolution while maintaining structural flexibility to cope with the volume expansion. The introduction of sulfur between the flexible polymer-anchored graphene layers is achieved by a simple chemical reaction at ambient temperature. The obtained sulfur-carbon composite demonstrates superior sulfur efficiency and cyclability compared to mesoporous carbon-based counterparts. The strong interfacial attraction between sulfur and highly-conductive graphene sheets at the confined interlayer space enables rapid charge transfer and effectively inhibits the polysulfide dissolution, resulting in improved redox reaction reversibility and sulfur efficiency. More importantly, the structural flexibility of layered structure, derived from polymer-anchor, guarantees the stable cycling by accommodating the significant volume expansion of sulfur active materials. Our work provides a simple, proof-of-concept strategy for improving the overall performance of carbon-based positive electrode for Li-S batteries.

Sulfur/mesoporous carbon composites combined with gamma-MnS as cathode materials for lithium/sulfur batteries	IONICS			English	Article						Sulfur composite electrode; Manganese Sulfide; Deposition; Lithium/sulfur Batteries	PERFORMANCE	With the aim to develop high-performance sulfur electrode, manganese sulfide (MnS) was combined with sulfur/porous carbon composite electrode by a simple precipitation method. Both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results show that as-prepared MnS corresponds to Rambergite phase with a hexagonal structure (gamma-MnS). MnS could be uniformly dispersed in the carbon matrix when the content was less than 20 wt%. When the content of MnS increased, gamma-MnS particles aggregated on both outside of the mesoporous carbon channels and the surface of carbon particles. The CV curves of MnS/MC in the first cycle were similar to elemental sulfur, indicating partially decomposed MnS at the surface of mesoporous carbon. Charge/discharge tests indicated that the initial discharge-specific capacity of S/MnS/MC was 1412.5 mAh g(-1) and remained a reversible capacity of 727.4 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at a current of 100 mA g(-1), which is superior to that of sulfur composite electrode without MnS.

Such a structure can not only store sulfur in the micro- and mesopores, which restrict the shuttling of polysulfides, but also ensure good electrical conductivity of the whole system due to the incorporation of CNTs. The hierarchical porous structure also ensures fast mass transportation. These factors effectively guarantee the high electrochemical performance of sulfur stored in this carbon in lithium-sulfur batteries.

To achieve this goal, the following requirements for designing carbon/metal compound composites need to be met: (i) the carbon materials need to exhibit suitable specific surface area, void structure, and electrical conductivity; (ii) the weight content of the metal compounds should be low; and (iii) the metal compounds need to show a strong adsorption and efficient electrocatalytic function for LiPSs. In this study, inspired by the body structure of an octopus, a new carbon/NiS2 hierarchical composite is reported, in which the apical NiS2 nanoparticles (0D) on a 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are supported on a three-dimensional carbon (3DC) framework (3DC-CNTs-NiS2). The 3DC-CNTs-NiS2 composite has a high specific surface area (271 m(2) g(-1)), good electrical conductivity, and low NiS2 content (9.2 wt %), and the apical NiS2 nanoparticles are capable of adsorption and electrocatalysis toward LiPSs, demonstrated by both electrochemical characterization and theoretical calculation. When used as a cathode host of the Li-S battery, it exhibits an ultra-stable cycling performance with a fade rate of 0.043% per cycle over 1000 cycles; even with a high S loading (6.5 mg cm(-2) with 90 wt % of S), the soft package battery delivers a high area capacity of 5.0 mAh cm(-2) under the E/S ratio of 5 mu LE mg(-1)s. This work provides a new approach to design and fabricate multi-functional S hosts with high S loading.

To solve these obstacles, we design a cobalt sulfide nanoparticle-embedded flexible carbon nanofiber membrane (denoted as CoS2@NCF) as sulfiphilic functional interlayer materials. The hierarchically porous structure of carbon nanofiber is conducive to immobilizing sulfur species and facilitating lithium-ion penetration. Moreover, electrocatalytic CoS2 nanoparticles can significantly enhance the catalytic effect, achieving favorable adsorption-diffusion-conversion interface of polysulfide. Combined with these synergistic features, the assembled Li-S cell with CoS2@NCF interlayer exhibited a great discharge capacity of 950.9 mAh g(-1) with prolonged cycle lifespan at 1 C (maintained 648.1 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles).

J	Xie, PF; Zhang, BY; Zhou, YK; Li, P; Tian, XH				Xie, Pengfei; Zhang, Bingyin; Zhou, Yingke; Li, Ping; Tian, Xiaohui			A dual-coated multifunctional separator for the high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						PMMA; Li7La3Zr2O2 sheets; Acetylene black; Multifunctional separator; Li-S battery	GEL POLYMER ELECTROLYTE; PERMSELECTIVE SEPARATOR; CARBON; LAYER; ANODE	The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery has received widespread attention because of the high theoretical energy density and inexpensive raw material. However, some issues still restrict its commercialization, including the shuttle effect, the lithium dendrite growth and low safety, etc. In this work, a PMMA-LLZO/PP/AB multifunctional separator was designed and facilely prepared to overcome these problems. A composite dense layer of the PMMA and LLZO sheets with excellent interface stability was coated on one side of the PP separator to face lithium metal anode, which can inhibit the lithium dendrites growth and increase the safety. Meanwhile, this composite coating possesses high affinity with the liquid electrolyte and the soluble polysulfides, which can improve the ionic conductivity, effectively adsorb the polysulfides. An acetylene black (AB) layer was further coated on the other side of the PP separator to not only act as an electron conductor but also adsorb and hinder the migration of lithium polysulfides. The co-modified PMMA-LLZO/PP/AB separator displays remarkable electrochemical performances and an excellent thermal stability. The cell with the co-modified separator exhibits high specific capacities of 1456 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 969 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C, and retains a capacity of 413 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles, corresponding to a retention of 42.6% as well as a low decay of 0.114%/cycle. Especially, the cell with the multifunctional separator also displays a high capacity and a low decay even for a high sulfur mass loading cathode of 2.5-3.0 mg cm(-2) or at a high temperature of 60 degrees C. The co-modified multifunctional separator has great application potential in the high-performance Li-S battery. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One of the effective solutions deals with concurrent management of both electrodes. Nevertheless, this direction remains in a nascent stage due to a lack of material selection and mechanism exploration. Herein, we devise a temperature-mediated direct chemical vapor deposition strategy to realize the controllable synthesis of three-dimensional boron/nitrogen dual-doped graphene (BNG) particulated architectures, which is employed as a light-weighted and multi-functional mediator for both electrodes in Li-S batteries. Benefiting from the "sulfiphilic" and "lithiophilic" features, the BNG modified separator not only enables boosted kinetics of polysulfide transformation to mitigate the shuttle effect but also endows uniform lithium deposition to suppress the dendritic growth. Theoretical calculations in combination with electro-kinetic tests and operando Raman analysis further elucidate the favorable sulfur and lithium elec-trochemistry of BNG at a molecular level. This work offers direct insight into the mediator design via con-trollable synthesis of graphene materials to tackle the fundamental challenges of Li-S batteries.

The CHPCFs exhibit a large length/diameter (L/D) ratio, a cross-linked structure and a reasonable hierarchical porous distribution, which provides "green channels" for both e(-) and Li+ transport. Besides, the CHPCFs possess large micro-porous surfaces to confine the polysulfide (PS) diffusion. As a result, the S/CHPCF cathodes simultaneously achieve excellent C-rate performance and cycling stability of 535 mA h g(-1) at 15C (1C = 1672 mA g(-1)), and 0.076% capacity attenuation per cycle at 5C during 500 cycles. The structure-performance relationship of the carbon materials and Li-S batteries was studied in detail. This research work sheds light on material design for Li-S batteries with excellent C-rate performance.

Herein we design a cross-linked framework of reduced graphene oxide anchored with Cu2-x Se nanoparticles (Cu2-x Se@rGO) by building an electrolyte/Cu2-x Se/graphene triple-phase interface to be a high-efficiency electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. Importantly, this three-dimensional conductive network possesses a large specific surface area with high ion transport capability, meanwhile providing strong physical constraint for efficient adsorption of soluble polysulfides. Further, this triple-phase catalytic interface provides strong chemical adsorption and abundant Cu2-x Se nanoparticle sulfiphilic active sites, effectively inhibiting the dissolution of polysulfides and guaranteeing the efficient polysulfide adsorption catalysis as well as rapidly uniform Li2S nucleation. Consequently, with the Cu2-x Se@rGO separator, a lower capacity decay rate about 0.059% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2 C is obtained. What's more, with a higher areal sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm(-2), the capacity is still maintained at 805 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles. Therefore, this work will open new avenue to construct 2D transition metal selenide for superior performance Li-S batteries.

Energy use and climate change improvements of Li/S batteries based on life cycle assessment	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						LCA; Global warming potential; Battery; Lithium-sulfur	LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; PLUG-IN HYBRID; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; CARBON; LCA; GRAPHENE; SYSTEMS	We present a life cycle assessment (LCA) study of a lithium/sulfur (Li/S) cell regarding its energy use (in electricity equivalents, kWh(el)) and climate change (in kg carbon dioxide equivalents, CO2 eq) with the aim of identifying improvement potentials. Possible improvements are illustrated by departing from a base case of Li/S battery design, electricity from coal power, and heat from natural gas. In the base case, energy use is calculated at 580 kWh(el) kWh(-1) and climate change impact at 230 kg CO2 eq kWh(-1) of storage capacity. The main contribution to energy use comes from the LiTFSI electrolyte salt production and the main contribution to climate change is electricity use during the cell production stage. By (i) reducing cell production electricity requirement, (ii) sourcing electricity and heat from renewable sources, (iii) improving the specific energy of the Li/S cell, and (iv) switching to carbon black for the cathode, energy use and climate change impact can be reduced by 54 and 93%, respectively. For climate change, our best-case result of 17 kg CO2 eq kWh(-1) is of similar magnitude as the best-case literature results for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The lithium metal requirement of Li/S batteries and LIBs are also of similar magnitude.

Much effort has been made to improve the practical energy densities and cycling stability of Li-S batteries via diverse designs of materials nanostructure. However, achieving simultaneously good rate capabilities and stable cycling of Li-S batteries is still challenging. Herein, we propose a strategy to utilize a dual effect of metal carbide nanoparticles decorated on carbon nanofibers (MC NPs-CNFs) to realize high rate performance, low hysteresis, and long cycling stability of Li-S batteries in one system. The adsorption experiments of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) to MC NPs and corresponding theoretical calculations demonstrate that LiPS are likely to be adsorbed and diffused on the surface of MC NPs because of their moderate chemical bonding. MC NPs turn out to have also an electrocatalytic role and accelerate electrochemical redox reactions of LiPS, as proven by cyclic voltammetry analysis. The fabricated Li-S batteries based on the W2C NPs-CNFs hybrid electrodes display not only high specific capacity of 1200 mAh/g at 0.2C but also excellent rate performance and cycling stability, for example, a model setup can be operated at 1C for 500 cycles maintaining a final specific capacity of 605 mAh/g with a degradation rate as low as 0.06%/cycle.

However, the commercialization of LSBs remains extremely challenging primarily due to poor cycling performance and safety concerns, which are inherently caused by low conductivity of S-8 and Li2S, severe polysulfide shuttling, and high polarization by solid Li2S2/Li2S deposition. Catalytic materials could facilitate the large-scale practical application of LSBs by overcoming all these challenges. In this review, we investigate the sulfur species evolution in LSBs and explore the roles of catalytic materials in charge/discharge processes, highlighting the catalysis of solid S-8 to liquid polysulfides and solid Li2S2 to Li2S. Furthermore, we offer systematic strategies from atomic to macro levels, including defect engineering, morphology engineering and catalyst compositing, to enhance catalysis efficiency in terms of sulfur supercooling, fast charge transfer, thiosulfate generation, disulfide bond cleavage, tuneable Li2S growth and Li2S decomposition enhancement. The design and availability of the proposed catalytic materials will further advance LSB technology from coin cells and pouch cells to the subsequent commercialization scale.

However, a series of problems, such as sulfur acting as an insulator, the shuttle effect and the growth of lithium dendrites, have hindered their commercial application. To simultaneously tackle these three challenges, a composite quasi-solid/gel polymer electrolyte consisting of a nonporous supporting layer made by lightly cross-linked PMMA and a coated acetylene black layer was prepared to realize high-performance Li-S batteries. The nonporous polymer membrane was used to efficiently suppress the growth of lithium dendrites and promote the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase, while the acetylene black layer facing the sulfur cathode can hinder the polysulfide diffusion and promote rapid electron transfer. The as-prepared lithium-sulfur batteries show good cycling stability for 200 cycles, with an initial specific capacity of 994.5 mA h g(-1) at 1C and perfect rate performance with a reversible capacity of 657.5 mA h g(-1) at 3C. The growth of lithium dendrites was also effectively suppressed. This work provides a new concept for the structural design of Li-S batteries and promises to promote the further commercialization of Li-S batteries.

In this study, N-doped ordered multi-hollow layered carbon embedded with Mo2C is successfully prepared (Mo2C@NC-NaCl) under the co-regulation of dicyandiamide and sodium chloride on the carbon material. In the carbon material, the multi-hollow layered carbon skeleton derived from biomass acts as an advanced sulfur host, which can accelerate electron trans-portation and buffer volume changes. The synergistic effect of Mo2C nanoparticles and pyridine N anchors lithium polysulfides and realizes fast sulfur electrochemistry. Benefiting from the above advantages, Mo2C@NC-NaCl with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2) delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1226.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. Even at a high rate of 1 C, the battery still achieves an initial capacity of 853.7 mAh g(-1) and the average capacity decay rate per cycle is 0.065% over 500 cycles. It is expected this work provides a new perspective for large-scale production of cathode materials for Li-S batteries.

The influence of sintering temperature and duration on the phase, ionic conductivity, and activation energy of Li6PS5Cl was systematically investigated. The Li6PS5Cl electrolyte with a high ionic conductivity of 3.15 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature (RT) was obtained by sintering at 550 degrees C for just 10 min, which was more efficient taking into account such a short preparation time in comparison with other reported methods to synthesize Li6PS5Cl SSEs. All-solid-state lithium sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) based on the Li6PS5Cl SSE were assembled by using the nano-sulfur/multiwall carbon nanotube composite combined with Li6PS5Cl as the cathode and Li-In alloy as the anode. The cell delivered a high discharge capacity of 1850 mAh g(-1) at RT for the first full cycle at 0.176 mA cm(-2) (similar to 0.1C). The discharge capacity was 1393 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. In addition, the Coulombic galvanostatic cycling. The experimental data showed that Li6PS5Cl was a good candidate for efficiency remained nearly 100% during the SSE used in ASSLSBs.

However, most of reported solid state Li-S batteries (SSLSBs) with SPEs show unsatisfying cycle performances owing to low utilization of S and notorious shuttle effect. In our case, to address above issues, a mixed electron/ion conducting interlayer which consists of carbon nanotubes, polyethylene oxide and lithium salt is introduced into SSLSBs. The carbon nanotubes and mixture of polymer/lithium salt construct conductive channels of electrons and Li ions, respectively, resulting in electronic/ionic conductivity of the interlayer. Additionally, the carbon nanotubes of interlayer can absorb polysulfides. Therefore, the interlayer can localize polysulfides and deliver electrons/Li ions to them, enabling polysulfides to accomplish redox reaction in the interlayer. The results shows that SSLSBs with interlayer deliver initial discharge capacity of 750 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C under ambient temperature, and 83.8% capacity is retained after 320 cycles. Even the current rate is increased to 0.1 C, the SSLSBs show an initial discharge capacity of 740 mAh g(-1) with 70% capacity retention after 400 cycles. Undoubtedly, the strategy of the mixed electron/ion conducting interlayer will be a milestone to SSLSBs.

The 1T-MoS2 significantly accelerates the conversion Li2S8 catholyte to Li2S, chemically adsorbs lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) from solution, and suppresses crossover of the LiPSs to the anode. These experimental findings are explained by density functional theory calculations that show that 1T-MoS2 gives rise to strong adsorption of polysulfides on its surface and is electrocatalytic for the targeted reversible Li-S conversion reactions. The CC/1T-MoS2 electrode in a Li-S battery delivers an initial capacity of 1238 mAh g(-1), with a low capacity fade of only 0.051% per cycle over 500 cycles at 0.5C. Even at a high sulfur loading (4.4 mg cm(-2)) and low electrolyte/S (E/S) ratio of 3.7 mu L mg(-1), the battery achieves an initial reversible capacity of 1176 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C, with 87% capacity retention after 160 cycles. The post 500 cycles Li metal opposing 1T-MoS2 is substantially smoother than the Li opposing CC, with XPS supporting the role of 1T-MoS2 in inhibiting LiPSs crossover.

However, the market penetration of Li-S batteries has been plagued due to the gap in scientific knowledge between the fundamental research and the real application need. Here, a facile and effective approach to integrate commercial carbon nanoparticles into microsized secondary ones for application in high loading sulfur electrodes is proposed The slurry with the integrated particles is easily cast into electrode laminates with practically usable mass loadings. Uniform and crack-free coating with high loading of 2-8 mg cm(-2) sulfur are successfully achieved. Based on the obtained thick electrodes, the dependence of areal specific capacity on mass loading, factors influencing electrode performance, and measures used to address the existing issues are studied and discussed.

By creating three-dimensionally interconnected micropores and mesopores, sufficient space for sulfur storage, as well as electrolyte pathways, can be secured in the carbon spheres. Sulfur is mainly confined in mesopores with diameters of a few tens of nanometers in the carbon spheres and separated on the mesoscopic domain, which is advantageous for enhancing charge transfer and effectively accommodating volume expansion of sulfur during electrochemical reactions with Li+. The important role of the micropores, with diameters of less than 2 nm, is to extend effective interfacial contact between the sulfur and electrolyte, leading to enhancement of Li+ mobility. The sulfur-porous carbon sphere composite exhibits excellent cyclic performance and rate capability without significant capacity degradation caused by the loss of soluble Li polysulfides or electrical isolation of the active sulfur in the cathode. Importantly, the shape of the porous carbon spheres is advantageous for building robust electrodes with high-energy density. Our observations, based on various structural and electrochemical analyses, will be helpful for understanding and consolidating the fundamental aspects of the electrochemistry of sulfur. Furthermore, our approach is expected to be helpful in designing and tailoring advanced cathode materials with improved performance for lithium-sulfur batteries.

The biggest challenge regarding the application of the Li-S battery is to suppress the polysulfide shuttle while maintaining a high sulfur loading mass. Here, a dual polysulfide confinement strategy is designed by confinement of sulfur in polydopamine-coated MXene nanosheets (denoted as S@Mxe@PDA) that performs as a high-performance cathode for Li-S cells owing to their inherently high underlying metallic conductivity and chemical bonding and strong chemical adsorption to lithium polysulfides (LPs). This dual LPs confinement strategy is supported by the results of density functional theory calculations. It is demonstrated that the S@Mxe@PDA cathode exhibits outstanding electrochemical properties, including high reversible capacity (1044 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles at 0.2 C), superior rate capability (624 mAh g(-1) at 6 C) and excellent cycling stability (556 mAh g(-1) after 330 cycles at 0.5 C with 4.4 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading). This work offers a facile and effective method for boosting Li-S batteries into practical applications.

In this work, the hollow V2O5 nanospheres wrapped by activated carbon as the host material for sulfur were prepared. The results indicate that initial specific discharge capacity of the electrode is 972mA h g(-1) and it can be maintained at 730mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. The average decay rate of the capacity for the AC@V2O5/S only is 0.09% per cycle after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. This excellent performance could result from the polar hollow V2O5 nanospheres providing more adsorption sites, which are conducive to electrolyte diffusion and confine polysulfides during the reaction of sulfur and polysulfide.

To solve this problem, carbon nanotubes modified by Co3O4 nanoparticles were prepared as the cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. Uniform-sized Co3O4 nanoparticles are highly effective to chemically adsorb the soluble polysulfides to inhibit the "shuttle effect". Moreover, the effect of Co3O4 content on the final electrochemical performance is also discussed. Co3O4 has strong chemical interaction but a low inherent electrical conductivity. It is necessary to balance the LiPS adsorption capability as well as the electrical conductivity of the composite material, and an excess amount grown on the carbon nanotubes will not lead to further increased electrochemical performance. Finally, compared with unmodified carbon nanotubes, the optimized composite material with decorated Co3O4 delivers improved high-rate and cycling performance. The specific capacity at 0.2 C reaches 821 mAh g(-1) and capacity retention of 81.7% can be achieved at 0.5 C after 200 charge and discharge cycles.

Efficient conversion of lithium polysulfides into S as well as Li2S/Li2S2 in the charge and discharge process is a crucial factor to improve the performance of LSBs. Among all the competing polysulfides conversion catalysts, MoS2 is considered as the one of the strongest competitors. Herein, the dual effects of nickel introduction and phosphorus doping on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of MoS2 materials are detailedly investigated. It has been found that the Ni-P coordinated sites on the MoS2 can provide the affluent sites for adsorption and conversion of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the phase transition of MoS2 from 2H phase to metallic 1T phase can be distinctly improved owning to nickel introduction, which enhances the electrochemical performances of LSBs. Besides, the P-0.1-Mo0.9Ni0.1S2/CNT/S displays a good initial capacity of 742 mAh g(-1) with a low fading rate of 0.075% per cycle at 1C as well as the discharge capacity of 463 mAh g(-1) at the 500th cycle. Therefore, the strategy of Ni introduction and heteroatom doping can effectively inhibit Polysulfides shuttle and promote the performance of LSBs.

However, there are still many difficulties in the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries, such as large volume expansion of sulfur and shuttle effect of polysulfides, which led to rapid capacity attenuation and poor cycling performance. To address these problems, herein, nanosized phosphorus-modified Fe4N supported by nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped graphene nanosheets (P-Fe4N@NPG) has been synthesized by a simple solvothermal method combined with subsequent nitriding and phosphating calcination, and then used as a sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries. Benefiting from the high electrical conductivity, multiple composition and unique structure, the obtained P-Fe4N@NPG/S cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performances: the cathode presents a high initial specific capacity of 1386.1 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, distinct cycling performance (417.4 mA h g(-1) at 1C after 1000 cycles) and excellent rate performance with a sulfur loading of 73 wt%. Even if the sulfur loading increases as high as 3.52 and 5.65 mg cm(-2), the cathode still displays an excellent rate performance and outstanding areal capacity of 6.03 mA h cm(-2), respectively. These results indicate that our design of P-Fe4N@NPG is a great development in the application of sulfur hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we describe a strategy to synthesize highly pyridinic-N-doped three-dimensional (3D) carbons for the chemisorption of LiPSs, which consist of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8-derived carbon (ZIF-8(C)) coated on the surface of N-doped carbon nanotubes supported by carbon nanosheets (NCNTs-CS-ZIF-8(C)). Using the obtained carbons as sulfur hosts, the S/NCNTs-CS-ZIF-8(C) cathodes show a high sulfur utilization of 86% at 0.1 C, a low capacity decay rate of 0.052% per cycle over 700 cycles at 1 C and impressive cycling life that is 564 mA h g(-1) after 700 cycles at 1 C. First principles calculations based on the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) reveal that increasing the amount of the pyridinic-N component can enhance the adsorption of LiPSs, which yields effective suppression of the LiPS shuttle.

Various strategies have been proposed to boost the performances of Li-S batteries, including nanostructured sulfur composites, functional separators/interlayers, electrode/electrolyte additives, and so on. However, how to combine two or more strategies to efficiently settle these challenging issues confronted by Li-S batteries is in desperate need. Here, we demonstrate a powerful combined strategy of introducing novel 3D WS2/carbon nanotube (CNT) networks built by hybridization of 1D CNTs with 2D WS2 into Li-S batteries, simultaneously serving as a functional cathode additive and separator coating. Such 3D WS2/CNTs networks with abundant edge sites, a large active surface, and a fast electron pathway twice perform functions from the cathode side and separator surface: (1) to suppress polysulfide diffusion through a physical barrier and chemical interactions; (2) to accelerate LiPS conversion reactions; and (3) to enhance conductivity for better sulfur reactivation and high utilization. As a result, the as-built WS2/CNTs-incorporated battery configuration achieves a commendable combination of capacity, rate, and cycle stability (1491 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, 754 mA h g(-1) at 5 C, and initial capacity of 1069 mA h g(-1) with an ultralow decay rate of 0.040% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C) along with remarkably mitigated anode corrosion and low self-discharge.

Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) and their derived nanomaterials are ideal sulfur-fixing materials owing to their abilities to anchor LiPSs, accelerate redox conversion, and smooth Li2S precipitation. Herein, the hollow CoxFe3-xO4 heterostructure nanocages with highly interconnected pore architecture obtained by a PBA-assisted strategy are synthesized to overcome the abovementioned obstructions of LSBs. It is found that the bimetallic oxide-based heterostructure can not only inhibit LiPS diffusion via forming metal-sulfur bonds but also accelerate the LiPS conversion kinetics. Meanwhile, the hollow porous structure contributes to the physical confinement of LiPSs and acts as a buffer for the volume change. Thereby, the rate capability and cycling stability of hollow CoxFe3-xO4@S composite electrodes have been improved significantly. As a result, the hollow CoxFe3-xO4@S cell displays an excellent initial capacity of 1301.6 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). Even at 1 A g(-1), it exhibits an outstanding initial capacity of 898.9 mAh g(-1) with a negligible capacity loss rate, which is only 0.106% per cycle after 500 cycles. This work provides a new perspective for the construction and design of multifunctional hollow heterostructure materials for more efficient and stable LSBs.

Herein, we found that, despite the weak polysulfide adsorption on hierarchical S-doped carbon nanocages (hSCNCs), the hSCNC-encapsulated sulfur cathode still exhibited better performance than the counterpart using undoped carbon nanocages, showing a high capacity of 579 mA h g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) after 400 cycles, and a high areal capacity of 4.7 mA h cm(-2) with a high sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2). The electrocatalysis-promoted mechanism of S-doped carbon was demonstrated, which facilitated polysulfide conversion and suppressed the polarization effect, thereby leading to superior performance.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium-polysulfides (LiPSs) and the sluggish conversion kinetics impede the wide commercialization of LSBs. In this work, porous and catalytic MoN nanosheets were fabricated on the conductive carbonized cotton cloth (denoted as CCC@MoN) to serve as an interlayer for LSBs. The porous structure of MoN nanosheets provides abundant catalytic sites to capture LiPSs and accelerates conversion kinetics. Notably, hollow and conductive fibers in CCC substrate can physically restrain LiPSs and serve as a secondary current collector to recycle the dissolved sulfur species. Thus, the highly catalytic porous MoN and conductive CCC can synergistically generate an efficient trapping-conversion ability toward polysulfides. With the assistance of the CCC@MoN interlayer, the LSBs exhibit remarkable cycling stability and rate performance. Even with a high areal sulfur loading (5 mg/cm-1) cathode, an impressive areal specific capacity of 4 mAh/cm(-1) can still be achieved at 0.1 C. This work paves a new way for the design of multifunctional interlayers in the commercial application of LSBs. (C)& nbsp;2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, several limitations of LSBs such as the lithium polysulfide shuttle, large volume expansion, and low electrical conductivity of sulfur need to be resolved for practical applications. To address these limitations, herein, a multidimensional architectured hybrid (Co@CNT/nG), where Co3O4 nanoparticles are encapsulated into three-dimensional (3D) porous N-doped reduced graphene oxide interconnected with carbon nanotube (CNT) branches, is synthesized through a simple pyrolysis method. The synergistic effect achieved through the homogeneously distributed and encapsulated Co3O4 nanoparticles, the interconnected CNT branches, and the 3D hierarchical porous structure and N-doping of Co@CNT/nG significantly suppresses the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and enhances the conversion redox kinetics for the improved sulfur utilization. We validate this effect through various measurements including symmetric cells, Li2S nucleation, shuttle currents, Tafel slopes, diffusion coefficients, and post-mortem analyses. Importantly, Co@CNT/nG-70S-based LSB cells achieve a high-specific capacity of 1193.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and a low capacity decay rate of 0.030% per cycle for 700 cycles at 5 C, delivering a high areal capacity of 5.62 mAh cm(-2) even with a loading of 6.5 mg cm(-2).

However, practical applications of LSBs are still largely hindered by the complicated sulfur redox reactions and the fatal polysulfide shuttling. In nature, cytochrome c reductase works as an efficient biocatalyst for oxidative phosphorylation benefiting from the synergistic electron transfer between porphyrins and sulfur clusters. Inspired by this, herein, two porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks (Hf-H2DPBP and Hf-CoDPBP) supported by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were demonstrated to be efficient electrocatalysts for accelerating polysulfide redox kinetics when as separator coatings for LSBs. Consequently, the cells exhibited high initial specific capacities of 1345 mAh g(-1) (Hf-H2DPBP/CNT) and 1325 mAh g(-1) (Hf-CoDPBP/ CNT) at 0.1 C, and maintained outstanding stability with capacities of 582 mAh g(-1) (Hf-H2DPBP/CNT) and 513 mAh g(-1) (Hf-CoDPBP/CNT) after 500 cycles at 2 C with a decay rate of only 0.079% and 0.086% per cycle, respectively. Even at a high sulfur loading up to 6.2 mg/cm(2), the cells still demonstrated excellent performances with an initial specific capacity of 911 mAh g(-1) (Hf-H2DPBP/CNT) and 952 mAh g(-1) (Hf-CoDPBP/CNT) at 0.1 C, and retained the specific capacities of 745 mAh g(-1) (Hf-H2DPBP/CNT) and 818 mAh g(-1) (Hf-CoDPBP/ CNT) after 60 cycles, respectively. Furthermore, the high and comparable electrochemical performances can be attributed to the remarkable redox kinetics of both free-base and Co porphyrins toward polysulfides, as supported by DFT calculations.

Herein, the 3d transition metal (TM) doped 2D boron nitrides (BN), labeled as TM-BN, are studied for the anchoring and redox kinetics of LiPSs using first principles calculations. From the simulated results, the TM atom and adjacent N atoms are active adsorption sites for binding S atoms in LiPSs/S8 and Li atoms in LiPSs, respectively. A negative d-band center closer to the Fermi level of TMBN is key for enhancing the binding strength of TM-S and lowering the Li2S decomposition energy barrier, while it deteriorates the activity of adjacent N atoms. Fortunately, the electrolyte environment has little effect on the superiority of the TM-BN for binding polysulfides/S8, guaranteeing the sturdy anchor of polysulfides/S8 in realistic conditions. The trade-off effect on the activities of TM and adjacent N atom sites in TM-BN for binding LiPSs highlights the excellence of Ti/V/Cr-BN as modification materials for LSB. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Highly dispersed MoP encapsulated in P-doped porous carbon boosts polysulfide redox kinetics of lithium-sulfur batteries	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Metal organic framework; Electrocatalysis; Molybdenum phosphide; Shuttle effect	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; MOLYBDENUM PHOSPHIDE; HYDRODESULFURIZATION; PERFORMANCE; CATALYSTS; SHUTTLE; LI2S	Lithium-sulfur batteries have been considered as a promising next-generation battery system because of their high theoretical energy density and natural abundance of sulfur. However, the loss of active material and the sluggish kinetics of polysulfide severely hinder the large-scale application. Herein, the highly dispersed MoP nanocrystallites encapsulated in phosphorus-doped porous carbon (MoP@PC) is successfully synthesized by metal organic framework-derived strategy. As a polysulfide reservoir, MoP@PC can efficiently capture and convert polysulfides by constructing a well-designed adsorption conversion cooperative interface to enhance kinetics. Typically, the lithium-sulfur cell with a MoP@PC reservoir exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1158 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 degrees C and an enhanced sulfur utilization of 17% (285 mA h g(-1)). The present strategy provides applicable guidelines for synthesizing other highly dispersed transition metal compounds and optimizing the reaction interface of electrocatalyst material for lithium-sulfur battery.

Regarding sulfur-based cathodes, they not only help to strengthen the utilization of sulfur, but also effectively immobilize polysulfides to alleviate their dissolution and diffusion. Herein, a new confinement strategy is initiated by a distinctive sulfur scaffold, namely nitrogen doped graphitic ladder-structured carbon nanotubes (NGLCNTs) loaded with appropriate amount of metallic cobalt nanoparticles. Benefiting from both the unique graphitic ladder-structure and metallic cobalt nanoparticles in the nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes, the NGLCNTs host not only promotes ion transfer and electron transmission during the redox reactions from higher-order polysulfides to Li2S2/Li2S, but also efficiently restricts the outward diffusion and dissolution of polysulfides as well as benefits the nucleation and growth of Li2S. As a result, the NGLCNTs/S cathode has successfully overcome the crucial issues, and it exhibits greatly enhanced electrochemical performances with excellent rate capabilities of up to 8C and long term cycling life of over 500 cycles.

Here we report a novel matryoshka-like CuS@void@Co3O4 architecture of double micro-cubes (is-cubes) that locks sulfur between the CuS core and the Co3O4 shell. Plenty of existing spaces between the is-cubes suffice a high loading of sulfur and volumetric accommodation. The robust, double closed cubes configuration greatly enhances the confinement of polysulfides. In parallel, the CuS core increases the electronic conductivity and contributes to additional capacity, while the Co3O4 shell ensures a better interface activity. A high Li+ ion diffusion coefficient is obtained during the sulfur and lithium sulfide transformation. The constructed battery displays an initial capacity up to 1480 mAh g- 1, and a Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 99%. A capacity retention higher than 500 mAh g- 1 with a CE larger than 99.8% after cycling 400 times at 0.2 C are achieved. In addition, under a temperature of -5 degrees C, a high capacity of 700 mAh g- 1 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles is achieved, indicating a good low-temperature tolerance.

However, sulfur electrodes still suffer from rapid capacity fading, which is mainly caused by the undesirable dissolution of polysulfide intermediates and the irreversible deposition of discharge products. In this work, we describe an interconnected core-shell pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile@carbon/sulfur (pPAN@C/S) nanostructure for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Sulfur was firstly confined in a conductive porous carbon host as C/S to enhance the conductivity of sulfur, constrain polysulfide intermediates and alleviate volume expansion during cycling. Then a conductive pPAN shell was formed by annealing of PAN absorbed on the surface of C/S at 300 degrees C to further prevent polysulfide intermediates from dissolution by an additional physical and chemical barrier. Meanwhile, the conductive pPAN shell could prevent the irreversible deposition of insoluble discharge products, leading to improved cyclic stability. The interconnected core-shell pPAN@C/S electrodes exhibit a very high initial discharge capacity of 1269 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and show excellent cycling stability and rate performance.

Herein, La2O3 nanoparticles anchored on graphene composite is designed and demonstrates a high-performance sulfur immobilizer and conversion promoter. Benefiting from the composite, the corresponding Li-S batteries display good cycling stability (capacity fading rate 0.051 % per cycle after 500 cycles), high initial specific capacity (1423.7 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)), and excellent cycling performance at high sulfur loading (5.03 mg cm(-2)). The results of experiments and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations revealed that the La2O3 nanoparticles is a desirable separator modification material that can effectively tuning the absorption and conversion interactions with polysulfides through S-La and Li-O chemical bonds.

Herein, high catalytic-activity Ce-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were combined into reduced graphene oxides (rGO) as the sulfur cathode (Ce-doped TiO2/rGO/S). The impact of doping amounts of Ce on oxygen vacancies (OVs) was studied. Among the different Ce doping amounts, the 0.4 wt% Ce doping TiO2 (0.4 Ce-TiO2) exhibits the best catalysis and adsorption for Li2S6 due to the most OVs in 0.4 Ce-TiO2. Rich OVs can provide more active sites for sulfur adsorption and present stronger catalytic activity to polysulfides. With an electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio of 7 mu L mg(S)(-1), the 0.4 Ce-TiO2/rGO/S exhibits the best electrochemical capability when compared with TiO2/rGO/S and rGO/S. It has a high capacity of 1421.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C=1675 mA g(-1)), and excellent rate performance. The 0.4 Ce-TiO2/rGO/S also has a higher capacity and more stable cyclic performance than TiO2/rGO/S when the temperature elevates to 60 degrees C.

In this work, we prepared a hierarchical N/P co-doped porous carbon (DPC) via NH4H2PO4 and KHCO3 dual-activation of the porous carbon, which was obtained by annealing of nano-calcium carbonate/sucrose composites.

The structural superiority of DPC host materials, i.e., highly porous structure, hierarchical pores and N/P co-doping contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of the materials.

To address such issue, we fabricated a homogeneous ultrathin Ta(2)O(5)( )layer deposited on separators via typical pulsed laser deposition. The polar surface of the Ta2O5 coating can not only serve as a barrier inhibiting polysulfides shuttling due to strong chemisorption, but also accelerate the redox kinetics of immobilized polysulfides, which was demonstrated by density functional theory calculations and electrochemical experiments. With the Ta2O5 modified separator, the cell using a cathode prepared by nitrogen-doped graphene achieves good rate capability in contrast to the one with bare commercialized separator. Specifically, even at a high areal sulfur loading of 5.27 mg cm(-2), the cell can deliver a high initial areal capacity of 5.3 mAh cm(-2) and retains 4.2 mAh cm(-2) over 60 cycles, which exceeds commercial lithium-ion batteries (4 mAh cm(-2)), suggesting its actual application possibility.

However, to bring Li-S batteries into real life, several challenges still need to be overcome, such as dissolution of intermediate polysulfides, large volume change, and low electrical conductivity of sulfur. In this study, phosphorus-doped graphene anchored with well-dispersed cerium oxide nano-crystals (CeO2/PG) were prepared as effective sulfur host materials through a hydrothermal synthesis method followed by a thermal treatment process. The cerium oxide nanocrystals/phosphorus-doped graphene (CeO2/PG) nanocomposites can provide high electrical conductivity, sufficient spaces for the storage of sulfur, and strong chemical binding with polysulfides. In particular, well-dispersed polar CeO2 nanocrystals effectively exhibit chemical affinity with polysulfides and promote polysulfide redox reactions during the cycling. Furthermore, phosphorus dopants can offer a sufficient number of active sites for polysulfide trapping and enhance the overall electrical conductivity of graphene nanosheets. As a result, a S@CeO2/PG cathode with 72.3 wt% sulfur content exhibits a high specific capacity (1287 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C-rate) and good cycling stability (577.7 mA h g(-1) at 1 C-rate after 100 cycles).

In this paper, a TiO2/TiC composite substrate material with the different crystal structure by means of changing sintering temperature is synthesized and its physical properties and electrochemical performances have been researched. Through X-ray diffraction analysis, it can be found that the crystal structures of TiC and TiO2 in the TiO2/TiC composite substrate material sinter at different temperature both have been changed obviously due to the strong interaction between the oxygen atom and titanium and carbon atoms. By comparison, when sintering at 600 degrees C, the composite matrix material has higher crystallinity and they accordingly have some confusion after sintering at 500 degrees C. Raman spectrum information displays that TiO2/TiC composite substrate materials with high crystallinity allow the loaded sulfur to enter the pores and it is easier to form a stable physical adsorption. However, TiO2/TiC composite substrate material with some confusion is easier to form chemical adsorption with sulfur. Electrochemical test results illustrate that the specific discharge capacities of TiO2/TiC composite substrate material with the higher crystallinity loaded 55% sulfur can be achieved to 1247.91 and 834.62 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 0.5C, respectively. Then, after 300 times charge and discharge cycles at 0.2C, the discharge capacity retention rate of TiO2/TiC composite substrate material with some confusion loaded 45% sulfur can reach 54.40%. To sum up, we can conclude that the TiO2/TiC composite materials with different crystal structures will have a serious impact on the electrochemical performances of sulfur cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the sluggish redox reaction due to the low conductivity of discharge products is the major challenge that still impedes its application. In this work, iodine is introduced into sulfur/graphene composite via an facile in situ chemical reaction method, forming a sulfur/iodine/graphene (S/I-2/G) composite cathode material for LSB. During cycling, the generated intermediate I radicals can induce the formation of the oligomer as Li-permeable protective layer, which attaches to the cathode surface and can efficiently suppress the diffusion loss of polysulfides. Also, the introduced I-2 can promote the oxidation of Li2S/Li2S2 to Li2Sn (n = 4-8), thus decreasing the deposition of Li2S/Li2S2 on the electrode surface, reducing the overpotential and improving the active material's utilization. The optimized S/I-2/G cathode (S:I-2 = 1:0.1) material delivers better electrochemical performance as compared with that of the material without iodine. Even with a high mass loading of 6.0 mg cm(-2), the cathode still shows a low capacity decay rate of 0.13% per cycle and high Coulombic efficiency of 97.9% over 500 cycles. This work may offer a feasible design for developing high-loading cathode of LSB. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS"). Published on behalf of ECS by IOP Publishing Limited.

However, Li-S batteries face severe technical problems where the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides is the biggest problem because it leads to the degradation of the cathode and the lithium anode, and finally the fast capacity decay. Compared with the composites of elemental sulfur and other matrices, sulfur-containing polymers (SCPs) have strong chemical bonds to sulfur and therefore show low dissolution of polysulfides. Unfortunately, most SCPs have very low electron conductivity and their morphologies can hardly be controlled, which undoubtedly depress the battery performances of SCPs. To overcome these two weaknesses of SCPs, a new strategy was developed for preparing SCP composites with enhanced conductivity and desired morphologies. With this strategy, macroporous SCP composites were successfully prepared from hierarchical porous carbon. The composites displayed discharge/charge capacities up to 1218/1139, 949/922, and 796/785 mA h g(-1) at the current rates of 5, 10, and 15 C, respectively. Considering the universality of this strategy and the numerous morphologies of carbon materials, this strategy opens many opportunities for making carbon/SCP composites with novel morphologies.

However, the shuttle effect poses a formidable challenge to development of Li-S batteries. Considering that all ions in electrolytes move through separators between electrodes, significant attention should be paid to separators to prevent the shuttle effect. Here, a new class of spiderweb-mimicking, anion-exchanging separators based on polyionic liquids (spiderweb separators) is demonstrated to address the aforementioned issue. The spiderweb separator consists of sandwich-type functional nanomats (top/bottom layers = multi-walled carbon nanotube-wrapped polyetherimide nanomats, middle layer = poly(1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PVIm[TFSI], polyionic liquid)/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) nanomat) on polyethylene separator. The middle nanomat layer enables (discharge voltage-dependent) reversible trap/release of polysulfides via an anion exchange reaction between TFSI(-)anions (from PVIm[TFSI]) and polysulfides. The top/bottom nanomat layers respectively act as an upper current collector and a blocking layer to prevent crossover of polysulfides to Li anodes. Driven by its unique morphology and chemical functionalities, the spiderweb separator prevents the shuttle effect while ensuring facile ion transport, leading to exceptional improvement in the electrochemical performance (capacity = 819 mAh g(-1) and cycling retention = 72% (at 2.0 C/2.0 C) after 300 cycles) of Li-S batteries.

In this study, titanium nitride (TiN) nanocrystals merely and evenly anchored on carbon nanosheets (TiN@CNs) are prepared by heat treating TiO2@CNs in flowing ammonia. TiN nanoparticles do not accumulate in places without CNs, which can alleviate volume expansion in cycling process. CNs with high conductivity and a large specific surface area can accelerate Li+ and electron transportation and accommodate a higher sulfur content. Moreover, TiN nanocrystals can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate the redox reaction, which can be explained by the adsorption experiment of LiPSs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. Thus, the TiN@CNs-2/S cathode delivers an initial capacity of 1273 mAh g(-1) and remains at 908 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles for 0.5 A g(-1). For the long-term cycle performance, the cathode exhibits a slow capacity decay rate of 0.035% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2 A g(-1). This novel structure has potential in the design of advanced performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the technical challenges raised from the soluble polysulfide (PS) in organic electrolyte deter their implementation in practical applications. Nanoengineered structure and chemical adsorptive materials hold great promise in mitigating the PS migration problem. Here, we develop a tubular titanium oxide (TiO2)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite structure (TG) as a sulfur hosting material for constructing better performed LieS batteries. The TG/sulfur cathode (TG/S) is able to deliver similar to 1200 mAh g(-1) specific capacity with stable operation for over 550 cycles. Moreover, the TG/S composite cathode shows stable Coulombic efficiencies of over similar to 95% at various C rates, which are similar to 10% higher than those of the rGO/sulfur (G/S)counterparts. The superior electrochemical performances of TG/S could be ascribed to the synergistic effects between the conductive rGO support and the physically/ chemically absorptive TiO2, that is, the spatial tubular structure of TiO2 provides intimate contact and physical confinement for sulfur, while the polar TiO2 in TG/S shows strong chemical interaction towards the sulfur species.

J	Dong, Y; Ben, T				Dong Yan; Ben Teng			Impregnated Sulfur in Carbonized Nitrogen-containing Porous Organic Frameworks as Cathode with High Rate Performance and Long Cycle Life for Lithium-sulfur Batteries	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN CHINESE UNIVERSITIES			English	Article						Li-S battery; Nitrogen-containing porous carbon; Porous organic framework	COMPOSITES	The undesirable cycling performance caused by soluble polysulfides shuttling between anode and cathode has been considered as the main challenge that has hindered its practical applications for lithium-sulfur(Li-S) batteries. To solve this issue effectively, a nitrogen-containing porous carbon, namely JUC-Z2-900, developed from a porous organic framework, namely JUC-Z2, bearing a high surface area(805 m(2)/g), small pore size(0.5 nm) and nitrogen doping(2.15%, mass fraction), has been used as a host material for Li-S batteries. The micropores of JUC-Z2-900 can confine the smaller sulfur molecules S2-4, which can essentially alleviate the critical problem of polysulfide dissolution. Furthermore, nitrogen-containing JUC-Z2-900 can promote chemical adsorption of sulfur. The above two factors can improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries effectively. To compare the effects of sulfur contents and melt-diffusion strategy in JUC-Z2-900/S composites, a series of JUC-Z2-900/S composites was synthesized and their electrochemical performances were explored, indicating good rate performance and excellent cycling stability of the composites contributed by both appropriate mass percentage of sulfur and its confinement in the micropores.

To overcome these problems, we design new electrolytes containing N-methoxyethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (Pyr(1,201)TFSI) and tri(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (TEGDME) in mass ratio of 7:3. Moreover, Lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiODFB) is introduced for the modification. Although the addition of LiODFB as additive lead to extremely high viscosity of electrolyte and inferior performance of the cells, the electrolyte containing lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, 0.84 nm) and LiODFB (0.60 nm) mixture with a total molar concentration of 0.4 mol kg(-1) as binary lithium salt shows excellent electrochemical performance. The Pyr(1,201)TFSI/TEGDME electrolyte with LiTFSI/LiODFB binary lithium salts in mole ratio of 6:4 is obtained after optimizing ratio. The Li-S cells containing this electrolyte system show excellent capacity and cycle performance, whose initial discharge capacity is 1264.4 mAh g(-1), and retains 911.4 mAh after 50 cycles with the coulombic efficiency more than 95%. It can be attributed the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI)-forming ability of LiODFB which protect Li anode from suffering lithium dendrites and prevent the shuttle phenomenon. The novel electrolytes provide good cycling stability and high coulombic efficiency for the Li-S batteries, which is suggested as a promising electrolyte for Li-S batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To minimize the environmental impact of the Li/S cell manufacturing and to compete with Li-ion cells in both performance and cost, electrodes cast using an aqueous process are highly desirable. Here we describe the discovery and application of a lithiated redox-mediating supramolecular binder based on the well-known n-type semiconductor, perylene bisimide, that forms high-fidelity sulfur electrodes from water-processed slurries. A 1.4-fold improvement in sulfur utilization at 3.0 C and 58% increase in capacity retention after 250 cycles at 1.5 C are reported for the prelithiated, supramolecular binder compared to control samples. These improvements are attributed to the self-assembly of lithiated perylene bisimide binders in water to yield nanowire web morphologies that increase interfacial area between electrode components and exhibit enhanced electrode-current collector adhesion.

Al and Ti were respectively deposited onto the surface of S/AC electrodes by the method of radio-frequency magnetron sputtering to modify the electrodes and improve the battery performance. The properties of S/AC and the sputtered cathode materials, labeled S/AC/Ti and S/AC/Al, were characterized by XRD and FESEM. Electrochemical performances of the Li/S batteries with the three cathode materials were determined by alternating-current impedance, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant-current charge and discharge. Experiments showed that S/AC, S/AC/Ti and S/AC/Al delivered initial specific capacity of 1197 mA h g(-1), 1255 mA h g(-1) and 1257 mA h g(-1) respectively under the current rate of 0.5C. And the modified batteries operated reversibly over 100 cycles and maintained a discharge specific capacity of 722 mA h g(-1) and 977 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles, superior to 634 mA h g(-1) of S/AC. Besides, the coulombic efficiencies of the sputtered electrodes were over 0.97 after 100 cycles.

Herein, tungsten oxide/zirconia (WO3/ZrO2) with a ratio of 3:7 is prepared and incorporated into a 2D compacted Li2S-graphene matrix through pelletization. The proposed composite material shows a great potential as cathode material for Li-S batteries. In the composite cathode, the high electrical conductivity of graphene and presence of a metastable high-pressure Li2S phase allows the direct conversion of Li2S to S (8) during the first activation process, and simultaneously the incorporated tungsten oxide/zirconia particles act as a polysulfide mediator to block the outflow of soluble polysulfide into the electrolyte solution. Therefore, the composite cathode shows high interfacial stability and thus substantially 40 extends the lifetime of the Li-S battery over 200 cycles at a high Li,S loading of 10 mg cm(-2). The practical Li-S full battery fabricated by combining the composite cathode and graphite anode provides reliable cycling stability over 1500 cycles.

Premade yolk-shell particles with a S core and a carbon or conductive polymer shell are proven to be an effective way to alleviate all of the above three obstacles. Nevertheless, the reported preparation methods of yolk-shell particles with a S core and a polymer shell usually require complicated synthesis steps, which would severely inhibit their exploration in large-scale production. Here, a facile method to prepare Spa polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) yolk-shell particles with the S core and PVA shell via a self-emulsification process is reported. On the one hand, the presence of abundant active hydroxyl groups along PVA chains enables PVA to act as a polymeric surfactant of S/CS2 dispersed in water solution. On the other hand, these hydroxyl groups can be cross-linked by glutaraldehyde and form a robust shell. After the evaporation of CS2, perfect S@PVA yolk-shell particles can be obtained. Meanwhile, along with the escape of CS, solvent, a lot of submicron-sized pores on the PVA shell can be formed, which will provide transporting paths for Li' ions. Furthermore, the pore number on the shell is tunable by controlling the evaporation rate of CS,. After adding carbon (C) into the S core to enhance its electronic conductivity, the initial specific capacity of the corresponding Li-S-C@PVA battery can reach 1117 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, and the decay rate is only 0.036% per cycle at 1C for over 800 cycles.

CG is prepared by splitting multi-wall carbon nanotubes and loaded with S via chemical deposition and then coated with polyaniline via in situ polymerization under the control of ascorbic acid. The physical and electrochemical performances of the resulting CG-S@PANI are investigated by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, charge-discharge tests, and electronic conductivity measurements. CG-S@PANI as a cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries delivers an initial discharge capacity of 851 mA h g(-1) (616 mA h g(-1) on the basis of the cathode mass) at 0.2 C with a capacity retention of over 90% after 100 cycles. This nature is attributed to the co-contribution of CG and conductive PANI to the concurrent improvement in electronic conductivity and chemical stability of the sulfur cathode.

N-doping of carbon and deposition of the inherently polar MnO2 promote chemical binding of the host with sulfur and its reduction products, known as polysulfides. Meanwhile, proper N-doping can improve the electron conductivity of carbon, and the nanosheet structure may help to guarantee facile electron-and lithium-ion transport through MnO2. Attributed to these advantages, the NHPC@MnO2/S cathode with a high sulfur content (70 wt% and 2.6 mg cm(-2)) exhibited an excellent cycle stability: its capacity retention was 93% within 100 cycles at 0.5 C. It also displayed a good rate capability: discharge capacities being similar to 1130 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, similar to 1000 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, similar to 820 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, and similar to 630 mAh g(-1) at 2 C. Our work demonstrates the synergistic effect of MnO2 nanostructure and N-doped carbon nanospheres for enhanced performance of lithium-sulfur battery cathodes.

However, the poor reaction reversibility weakened its application. Here, a bifunctional electrocatalyst with highly active Co-N-x sites was synthesized by pyrolyzing Co/Zn bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks and used as separator coating layer to improve the reversibility of LSB. Using zinc as sacrificial template, the severe agglomeration of cobalt is effectively avoided, and abundant Co-N-x active sites are obtained. Investigations in reaction kinetic reveal that Co-N-x sites have a bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards Li2S deposition and dissolution during cycling. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the strong electrocatalytic effect of Co-N-x sites, which results in a reduced Gibbs free energy for the liquid-solid reactions of lithium polysulfides to Li2S. Under the same experimental condition, the introduction of Co-N-x bitunctional electrocatalyst contributed to a 31% reversible capacity increase for LSB, with a capacity of 896 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, and a slow capacity decay rate of 0.033% per cycle over 1000 cycles. Even for thick electrode with a sulfur loading of 6 mg cm(-2), a reversible capacity of 4.2 mAh cm(-2) can still be obtained at 0.2 C over 100 cycles.

Consequently, PNTF is sandwiched between sulfur cathode and separator to act as the functional interlayer for Li-S battery. Because of the adsorption effect between PPy and lithium polysulfides and the conductivity of PPy films, the polymer interlayer can not only decrease the polarization of sulfur cathode significantly, but also suppress shuttle effect and the redistribution of active material during charge/discharge process effectively. Li-S battery with the functional interlayer shows an encouraging electrochemical performance. With approximately 2.5-3 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading on the electrode, the initial discharge capacity is 1102 mAh g(-1), and the capacity retains at 712 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5C, and the coulombic efficiency increases to around 92% in the electrolyte without LiNO3.

The use of hazardous wastes derived from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), especially the activated carbon used in odor control systems, is a highly abundant, scalable, and cost-effective strategy. The reuse of waste materials is a key aspect, especially for the sustainable development of emerging energy storage systems, such as lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, granular active carbons from two WWTP treatment lines were regenerated in air at low temperature and utilized as the sulfur host with micro-/mesoporous framework. The resulting regenerated carbon and sulfur composites were employed as cathodes for Li-S cells. The SL-ACt3@S composite electrode with 60 wt% loaded sulfur exhibited a remarkable initial capacity of 1100 mAh g(-1) at C/10 rate and higher than 800 mAh g(-1) at C/2. Even at a rate of 1C, it maintained a high capacity of almost 700 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 85.4 % after 350 cycles, demonstrating a very low capacity fading of only 0.042 % per cycle. It is essential to note that the coulombic efficiency was always higher than 96 % during all the cycles. In this proposal, the only used source material was expired carbon from WWTP that was obtained with a simple and effective regeneration process. This "trash into treasure" strategy leads to a new way for using hazardous waste material as high-performance and environmentally safe electrodes for advanced Li-S batteries.

However, Li-S batteries have been plagued with fast capacity loss and dissolution and diffusion of the polysulfides. In this study, honeycomb polyaniline-dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (hPANI-DBSA) was prepared through the breath figure (BF) method, then, sulfur was electrodeposited on hPANI-DBSA and used to investigate the electrochemical properties of the Li-S cells. The hPANI-DBSA/S exhibit a higher capacity and excellent reversible capacity of 873.5 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. An initial specific capacity of 848 mAh/g at 0.2 C and coulombic efficiency of 99.3% over 100 cycles was achieved. The results suggest that this approach can also be useful for applying the Li-S cathodes for use in high capacity lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Herein, we report a bifunctional composite of heterostructured ZnO/Co3O4 nanocrystals on a 3D hierarchical reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotubes skeleton (ZCNC@GC). The strong polarity of ZCNC benefits the polysulfides adsorption and uniform Li deposition, inhibiting the polysulfides shuttling, and Li dendrite growth. Meanwhile, the micro/nano interface field effect combined with the overall network conductive skeleton establishes a smooth and hierarchical conductive pathway, facilitating the charge transfer, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics. As a result, the full battery affords a rate performance of 652 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and a capacity decay of only 0.034% per cycle at 5 C over 500 cycles, surpassing most Li-S batteries. This work provides a perspective on the interface engineering of electrode materials for fabricating built-in electric fields to promote the Li-S battery system.

However, the low conductivity of sulfur and the discharge species (Li2S2, Li2S), the shuttle issue of soluble intermediates, and the large volume change hinder their further practical application. In this study, vanadium dioxide (VO2) was successfully grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) surface via a one-step rapid and facile solvothermal method, and named as the VO2@rGO binary host. In this structure, the VO2 nanoflakes displayed intensive chemical adsorption for polar lithium polysulfide species (LiPSs), accelerating the conversion of long-chain LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S discharge products and thus suppressing the shuttling of soluble LiPSs. Additionally, rGO could ensure good electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode and significantly enhanced the electrochemical reaction kinetics. Particularly, the VO2@rGO/S cathode demonstrated a high initial discharge capacity of 1358 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and retained a stable cycling performance with a reversible capacity of 1049 mA h g(-1) over 370 cycles (low capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle). Such excellent performance revealed its good potential for use in advanced lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the TMDCs that engineer the electrode/electrolyte interface are usually produced through chemical hydrothermal methods, which show low crystallinity and thick multilayer structure. Herein, a highly crystalline and atomically thin tungsten disulfides on carbon cloth (WS2@CC) was developed via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and served as an effective electrode/electrolyte interface for Li-S battery. Our results demonstrate that the atomically thin WS2 with high crystal quality and abundant edges sites can effectively accelerates the redox kinetics of sulfur/lithium polysulfides and regulates the precipitation/decomposition of insoluble Li2S. More importantly, it was revealed that the hierarchical flower-stacked WS2 with excessive exposed catalytic edges shows extremely strong polysulfide adsorption, which causes the sulfur species aggregation and passivation on the WS2@CC surface, thus resulting in deformed rate performance and poor cycling stability as compared to the few-layer WS2@CC. Our work provides a new insight into the structural engineering of TMDCs by CVD for Li-S battery, and suggests the importance of rational chemisorption and catalysis of the interface to realize the high-performance Li-S battery.

In this work, a labyrinth electrode material design is presented to overcome these difficulties in lithium-sulfur batteries. The shell of NiO-Co3O4 hollow spheres as the "wall" to prevent the polysulfide dissolution cross-links into a labyrinth network as a sulfur host. The 3D labyrinth network not only provides enough inner space to load sulfur but also adapts to its large volume expansion during lithiation and delithiation. In addition, the polar NiO-Co3O4 shells can promote the chemical adsorption of polysulfides, while NiO-Co3O4 shells can promote the conversion of polysulfides into Li2S. With this unique design, the 3D labyrinth-like NiO-Co3O4@S electrode presents a good electrochemical performance, delivering high capacity with a stable cycling life of up to 200 cycles at 1C and the attenuation rate of each cycle is only 0.1%.

High-resolution transmission and scanning electronic microscopy observations showed the formation of irregularly interlaced nanosheet-like structure consisting of graphene with uniform sulfur coating on its surface. The electrochemical properties of the resulting composite cathode were investigated in a lithium cell with a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) prepared by trapping 1 mol dm(-3) solution of lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonamide in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether in a polymer matrix composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/poly(methylmethacrylate)/silicon dioxide (PVDF-HFP/PMMA/SiO2). The GPE battery delivered reversible discharge capacities of 809 and 413 mAh g(-1) at the 1st and 50th cycles at 0.2C, respectively, along with a high coulombic efficiency over 50 cycles. This performance enhancement of the cell was attributed to the suppression of the polysulfide shuttle effect by a collective effect of S/GNS composite cathode and GPE, providing a higher sulfur utilization.

To satisfy the commercial applications, it's necessary to establish the highly efficient and long-life Li-S batteries by synchronously restraining the shuttle effect and enhancing the polysulfides redox. Here, we prepared hierarchical mesoporous SnO2 nanosheets on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) namely C@SnO2 with the novel topological method. The obtained C@SnO2 materials not only show the strong chemisorption to trap polysulfides but also can more effectively decrease the electrochemical polarization to enhance the polysulfides redox. With the 3D conductive framework CNFs as the current collector, the hierarchical C@SnO2/S nanosheets material electrode delivered a specific capacity of 1228 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and retained a stable cycling performance at 2C over 1000 cycles with the decay as low as approximate to 0.024% per cycle.

However, their cyclic stability and life span are considerably impaired by polysulfide shuttling and self-discharge. Here, we design a microfiber glass filter-molybdenum disulfide/carbon-titanium nitride (mu FGF-MoS2/C-TiN) interlayer for suppressing the shuttle of polysulfides and selfdischarge of Li-S batteries. TiN in the interlayer molecularly captures high-order polysulfide Li2S8 with an adsorption energy up to -6.48 eV, the largest high-order polysulfide absorption value ever reported. The mu FGF-MoS2 layer mechanically seizes polysulfides with interconnected torturous mesopores by functioning as a molecular sieve. With a sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2), the Li-S batteries based on mu FGF-MoS2/C-TiN exhibit remarkable over-1000-cycle stability with an only 0.05% capacity decay per cycle and deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) at 1C. The self-discharge is alleviated with an insignificant 10.3% capacity loss after a 30-day rest.

To address the two main predicaments, we explored a dual functional 3D hierarchical filter element structured Mo2C nanosheet based sulfur electrode. The Mo2C based sulfur electrodes fulfill the requirements of conductivity (30 S cm(-1)) and entrapment of diffusing polysulfide intermediates, and meanwhile possess the advantages of high crystallinity and large specific surface area. As a filter and reservoir for polysulfides, Mo2C nanosheets possess a strong chemical interaction with polysulfides to mitigate the shuttling of polysulfides.

In this study, we successfully synthesized micro/mesoporous activated carbon from rice husk (AC-RH) through carbonizing the rice husk and activating it with ZnCl2. Elemental sulfur was loaded to the micro/mesopores through a solution infiltration method to form an AC-RH/S composite. The obtained AC-RH/S composites with different sulfur-loading levels were tested as cathode materials for lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The AC-RH/S composite with sulfur loading (AC-RH/S1) of 23 wt% showed an initial discharge capacity of 1352 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C-rate. After 100 cycles of charge/discharge at a current density of 335 mA g(-1), the AC-RH/S1 composite retained a high specific capacity of 518 mA h g(-1) with a capacity retention of 49%. The material delivered a capacity of 426 mA h g(-1) at 2C rate. These results suggest that rice husk can be a sustainable resource for the large-scale production of activated carbon, which is a promising material for the cathodes of Li-S batteries.

We prepared an NMCP/S composite by sublimating sulfur into NMCP. As a Li-S battery cathode, the NMCP/S composite delivers a high initial capacity of 1308mAhg(-1) at 50mAg(-1), a stable reversible capacity of 496.3mAhg(-1) after 150 cycles at 400mAg(-1), and an excellent rate capacity of 639mAhg(-1) at 800mAg(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the unique 3D carbon matrix. The mesoporous-carbon polyhedron structure ensures fast electron/ion diffusion and provides large free space for volumetric expansion of sulfur during repeated charge/discharge. Furthermore, nitrogen doping enhances conductivity and interaction between carbon host and polysulfide guest via chemical binding, which can suppress the shuttle of polysulfides to a certain extent.

The Li-S battery with the in situ barrier showed an initial specific capacity of 683 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 1675 mA g(-1), and maintained a discharge capacity of 454 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles. The capacity decay rate was 0.1% per cycle and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99% was achieved. Experimental characterizations and theoretical models demonstrate the in situ polymerized solid barrier stops sulfur transport while still allowing bidirectional Li+ transport, alleviating the shuttle effect and increasing the cycling performance. The soft and sticky nature of the solid electrolyte barrier makes it a good sealant, forming an enclosed catholyte chamber on the sulfur side.

However, it is still not conclusively known how polysulfide ring/chain participates in the whole cycling and whether the discharge and charge processes follow the same pathway. Herein, we demonstrate the direct observation of sulfur radicals by using in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique. Based on the concentration changes of sulfur radicals at different potentials and the electrochemical characteristics of the cell, it is revealed that the chemical and electrochemical reactions in Li-S cell are driving each other to proceed through sulfur radicals, leading to two completely different reaction pathways during discharge and charge. The proposed radical mechanism may provide new perspectives to investigate the interactions between sulfur species and the electrolyte, inspiring novel strategies to develop Li-S battery technology.

However, the commercialization application of Li-S battery is severely restricted by the intrinsic poor conductivity of sulfur, dissolution of polysulfide as well as the well-known shuttle effect. Herein, binary transition metal oxide manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4) prepared by coprecipitation was successfully used to modify the polypropylene (PP) separator for the first time. The bifunctional modified separator decorated with MnFe2O4 and conductive acetylene black (AB) can efficiently hinder the diffusion of polysulfides due to synergistic effect of effective chemical adsorption and auxiliary physical blocking. Consequently, the cells with modified separator exhibit outstanding rate capacities of 920mAh/g at 1C, 845mAh/g at 2C and superior cycling performance of 625mAh/g after 500 cycles at 1C with a low capacity decaying of 0.074% per cycle. To the best of our knowledge, this work not only firstly testifies that MnFe2O4 could entrap the polysulfide and alleviate the shuttle effect, but also presents a novel strategy by modifying separator with binary metal oxide to enhance the rate capacity and cycle performance of Li-S battery.

However, the rapid capacity fading of the batteries caused by the "shuttle effect" of soluble polysulfides restricted its applications. Here, a novel thermostable double-layer membrane based on F-doped poly-m-phenyleneisophthalamide (PMIA) membrane and F-mangano-manganic oxide (Mn3O4) co-doped PMIA membrane is fabricated through electrospinning method. The F-PMIA membrane and F-Mn3O4-co-doped PMIA membrane in the double-layer membrane can act as the matrix to prepare gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). More importantly, the F-doped PMIA membrane in combination with F-Mn3O4-co-doped PMIA membrane, render the engineered functional separator with extraordinary high electrolyte uptake and eminent preserving liquid electrolyte, excellent thermal stability and shrinkage resistance, strong catalytic conversion, forceful chemisorption and physical blocking the "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides for Li-S battery. Based on these merits, the assembled batteries with the novel separator exhibited a high first-cycle discharge capacity with 1237.1 mAh g(-1), excellent discharge capacity retention of 814.0 mAh g(-1) and high Coulombic efficiency of 98.83% after 1000 cycles at the current density of 0.5 C rate. In addition, the obtained Li-S battery with GPE presented a low interfacial resistance and high rate capacity (624.1 mA h g(-1) at 2 C rate after 600 cycles). The reasons of these excellent electrochemical performances for the battery using the prepared membrane were ascribed to the suppressed "shuttle effect" through both the physical trapping of lithium polysulfides by the GPE based as matrix on F-doped PMIA membrane and chemical binding of intermediates by F-Mn3O4-co-doped membrane. The new separator will open up an effective avenue to enhance the capability and cyclability of Li-S batteries.

Effects of cell construction parameters on the performance of lithium/sulfur cells	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						sulfur; graphene oxide; nanocomposites; electrolyte; binder; lithium batteries	POSITIVE-ELECTRODE MATERIALS; SULFUR BATTERIES; GRAPHENE OXIDE; LI-ION; CATHODE; CHALLENGES; BINDER; NANOTUBES	Current lithium-ion batteries are predicted to be unable to provide the specific energy required to meet the ever-increasing demands of rapidly emerging technologies. Due to a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh/g, sulfur has gained much attention as a promising positive electrode material for high specific energy rechargeable batteries. Although the lithium/sulfur cell has been studied for many years and continues to receive much attention today as an alternative power source for zero-emission vehicles and advanced electronic devices, the realization of this novel cell's promise as a commercial product has yet to be successful. The major problems with sulfur electrodes involve: (1) the dissolution of sulfur (as polysulfides) and the resulting diffusion of dissolved polysulfides and (2) the deposition of insulating products (including Li2S) on both the negative and the positive electrodes. These solid deposits can physically block the electrode reaction sites, thus passivating the electrode surfaces. Another important problem is the large volume change that occurs with the conversion of S to Li2S. It is important to understand that the performance of Li/S cells is hampered by linked chemical and mechanical degradations and both degradation mechanisms must be correctly alleviated in order to markedly improve current-technology Li/S cells. In this study, improved cycling performance via the reactive functional groups on graphene oxide to successfully immobilize sulfur and lithium polysulfides during operation has been demonstrated. The use of a new electrolyte and binder leads to improved cell performance in terms of high-rate capability (up to at least 2 C) and good reversibility (S Li2S), yielding at least 800 cycles have also been demonstrated.

A comprehensive approach is to tune the multi-electron redox reactions and construct reversible chemical bonds with polysulfide intermediates. In this study, RuO2 nano dots (NDs) are proposed to anchor polysulfides, trigger the surface-mediated reduction of polysulfides and to facilitate the formation of Li2S2/Li2S through its catalytic effect for the first time. When serving as the sulfur host, the RuO2 NDs can retard the shuttle of polysulfides, accelerate the redox reaction of polysulfides, and therefore result in improved sulfur utilization and enhanced rate performance. The designed RuO2@NMCs/S ternary electrodes with high sulfur loading of 70 wt% could achieve a low decay rate of 0.07% per cycle for 500 cycles at a 0.5 C-rate. Realized by fast electrode kinetics, the reversible capacity of 634 mA h g(-1) is attained at a high C-rate of 5 C. Overall, this strategy sheds new light on the oxide mediators for reversible modulation of electrochemical reactions in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.

The polysulfide shield is composed of Li+-Nafion, polyethylene oxide, and super P carbon. Hierarchical porous carbon is used as a sulfur holder to anchor polysulfide and improve cathode conductivity. Unlike all-solid Li-S batteries, the resultant Li-S battery shows excellent performance in both rate capacity and cycleability. The sulfur lithiation capacity reaches 1330 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C (0.335 A g(-1) of S) and 690 mAh g(-1) (338 mAh g(-1) of electrode materials) at 10 C (16.75 A g(-1) of S). The cell with the fabricated separator (SNP/Celgard) showed very low capacity degradation rate of less than 0.1% per cycle at 1 C (a discharge current density of 1.675 A g(-1)).

However, the notorious shuttle effect of the intermediate polysulfides as well as low conductivity of sulfur greatly limits their practical applications. Here, we introduce a new design that uses a porous-CNT/S cathode (PCNT-S) coupled with a lightweight multifunctional porous sulfur-nitrogen dual-doped graphene (SNGE) interlayer. It is confirmed that the introduced SNGE has outstanding conductivity, high ability to trap polysulfides, ability to modulate Li2S2/Li2S growth, and the functionality to protect separator integrity. With such rich functionalities, the SNGE interlayer enables the PCNT-S cathode to deliver a reversible specific capacity of similar to 1460 mA h g(-1) at 0.25C and a much higher rate performance, up to 40C, with a capacity retention of 130 mA h g(-1). Critically, these cathodes exhibited ultrahigh cyclability when cycled at 8C for 1000 cycles, exhibiting a capacity degradation rate of 0.01% per cycle. To the best of our knowledge, such a low capacity degradation rate beyond 5C in the cathodes of advanced Li-S batteries has been reported only rarely. These results impressively revealed the outstanding high-power output performance of the Li-S batteries.

Herein, MOF-derived Fe3C compounded with the nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheet, Fe3C/NG, was prepared and applied to realize a stable long cycle of Li-S batteries. With the catalytic and conductive Fe3C nanoparticles distributed on the conductive nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets, the Fe3C/NG composite could quickly adsorb and catalyze LPSs under a high current density or large sulfur loading, thus achieving high rate performance for the cell. Even at a current density of 6 C, the Li-S cell with the Fe3C/NG-coated separator can still have a specific capacity of 954.5 mA h/g at the first cycle, and maintain 439.9 mA h/g after 500 stable cycles. Meanwhile, when the cell has a high sulfur loading of 6.5 mg/cm(2), a stable specific capacity of 6.0 mA h/cm(2) could still be maintained at 0.1 C. Such a lightweight separator coating with excellent catalytic performance and conductivity can provide a good example for the search of catalytic coatings for the high-performance Li-S battery.

The branched KB particles serve as the structural skeleton to support CMSs while the hybrid polymer precursor forms multiscale pores upon pyrolysis. The CMSs possessing an extremely large pore volume of 2.08 cm(3)g(-1) and a large specific surface area of 756 m(2)g(-1) are melt-infiltrated with sulfur to form sulfur/CMS composite cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. The cathode delivers a remarkable initial capacity of 1006 mAh g(-1) at 1 C with high retention of 67.5% after 1000 cycles, and an initial capacity of 728 mAh g 1 at 2 C with high retention of 68.5% after 2000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the distinct functional and structural features of CMS framework: namely, microscale grain size, closely packed KB particles, large pore volume and hierarchical pore size, as well as superior conductive framework, which in turn suppress the shuttling of dissoluble polysulfides and boost the utilization of encapsulated sulfur. The above findings may offer insights into designing new carbon frameworks for other types of high performance rechargeable batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The electrodes are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge test. The cell with the rolled NFF interlayer shows superior performance in terms of capacity utilization, reversibility, and enhanced rate capability. It exhibits reversible discharge capacity of 604 mAh g(-1) after 80 cycles at 0.2 C, which is much higher than that of pristine sulfur without NFF (424 mAh g(-1)). The improvement on electrochemical performance is attributed to the 3D architecture of nickel foam foil as lithium-sulfur batteries interlayer, which can provide a good conductive network with structural stability and the porous architecture accommodating the migrating polysulfide to reduce the shuttling phenomenon during the charge-discharge processes.

Herein, a multi-functional composite interlayer is developed by in-situ polymerizing pyrrole (PPy) on graphene nanosheet (PPy/G) and examined by Fourier Transformed infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The graphene layers in PPy/G assure the high conductivity of the composite interlayer, while the high content of pyrrolic nitrogen sites of PPy in PPy/G composite interlayer can effectively trap the polysulfides (PSs) and promote the redox kinetics of PSs, which is valuable to suppress PSs dissolution and enhance utilization of sulfur content in Li-S batteries. Besides, the composite interlayer also facilitates the homogenous flux of Li+ and inhibits the growth of Li dendrite on Li metal anode. As a result, PPy/G interlayer delivers an impressive capacity of 535 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and an area capacity of 5.18 mAh cm(-2) at a sulfur load of 5.8 mg cm(-2) after 100 cycles. A steady capacity of 664 mAh g(-1) is also accomplished in lean-electrolyte condition after 100 cycles.

Here, using ball milling, a well-dispersed active material within the carbon network is achieved using carbon black Super C65 and synthetic graphite KS6 as conductive agents. Calendering these electrodes increases the electronic percolation path resulting in enhanced electrochemical performances and reaction kinetics. Using high-speed and high-impact preparation methods improves the quality and performances of the S-8/C composite electrodes when compared with electrodes prepared using a simple mixing method (magnetic stirring). The scanning electron microscopy images indicate that KS6 is able to incase S-8 particles, resulting in a homogeneous distribution of the active material that in turn enhances the accessibility of the active material by the electrolyte and electrons. Compared with the S-8/Super C65 composite electrode, a discharge capacity of 703 mAh g(-1) is delivered by the S-8/KS6 composite electrode during the first cycle. After 30 cycles, the S-8/KS6 composite electrode delivers 477 mAh g(-1) compared to only 411 mAh g(-1) for the S-8/Super C65 composite electrode due to a continuous capacity fading.

The morphology, structure and composition of the obtained NUCNT/S electrode were studied. Meanwhile, the effect of nitrogen doping on the electrochemical performance of the NUCNT/S cathode was discussed in detail. The results show that the NUCNT/S cathode presents excellent cyclability and rate capability, and the superior electrochemical properties of the NUCNT/S cathode can be attributed to the co-effect of rational design of the cathode nanostructure and successful nitrogen doping in the carbon matrix. On the one hand, NUCNTs with large surface areas and a special unzipped structure have a good effect on wrapping S particles. On the other hand, N doping can not only promote the distribution of sulfur particles and the electronic conductivity of the carbon matrix, but also immobilize the sulfur particles and polysulfides, which results in good sulfur utilization and long cycle life of the cathode. Therefore, the design of the NUCNT/S composite provides a promising candidate for the cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, and it also offers a strategy to prepare a sulfur cathode with a novel structure and advanced performance.

However, lithium-metal anode degradation remains a persistent problem causing safety concerns for Li-S batteries, hindering their practical utility. One possible strategy to circumvent the aforementioned problems is to use alternative, high-capacity, lithium-free anodes (e.g., Si, Sn, carbon) and a Li2S cathode. However, a large potential barrier was identified on the initial charge of insulating bulk Li2S particles, limiting the cell performance. In this work, the bulk Li2S particles were effectively activated with an electrolyte containing P2S5, resulting in a lowered initial charging voltage plateau. This permits the direct use of commercially available bulk Li2S particles as a high-capacity cathode for room-temperature, rechargeable Li-S batteries, significantly lowering the manufacturing cost of Li-S cells.

To solve the above problems, we construct a N-doped carbon nanotubes/carbonized cellulose paper (IF-N-CNTs-CCP) with three-dimensional conductive network structure through noncovalent modification assisted high-temperature carbonization. IF-N-CNTs-CCP interlayer can effectively block the shuttle effect by strong chemisorption and physical barrier, improving the utilization of sulfur. However, it doesn't prevent the free migration of lithium ions, resulting in a remarkable acceleration of electrochemical reaction kinetics. Moreover, the three-dimensional IF-N-CNTs-CCP interlayer can provide a large number of lithiophilic sites and significantly reduce the regional current density, thus inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites, enhancing the safety of LSBs. As a result, the LSBs with IF-N-CNTs-CCP interlayer deliver a negligible capacity fading rate of 0.037% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2.0 C, and a high-capacity retention of 95% at 0.2 C with a sulfur loading of 3 mg/cm(2) with a correspondingly lean electrolyte condition (E/S ratio = 6 mu L/mg). This work provides an effective strategy for the application of functional interlayer in LSBs, which can suppress the shuttle effect and lithium dendrite.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), growth of lithium dendrites, and overuse of lithium resources still hinder their further application. To address these problems, we constructed a porous network structure in which Sn is melted and coated on a frame that has a carbon nanotube (CNT) core and a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) coating as cross-linking shell (CNT@NC@Sn). This hierarchically porous membrane electrode, which has an ultrahigh porosity of approximately 90%, works as a matrix to strengthen the conductivity of Li+ and electrons and provides enough space for the conversion between sulfur and LiPSs. Moreover, the in situ thin coating of Sn not only promotes the adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs but also provides lithiophilic binding sites and induces uniform lithium deposition. Thus, the thiophilic-lithiophilic porous membrane electrode with lithium loaded on the frame (in the form of Sn-Li alloy) by electroplating can replace lithium sheets, reduce the use of Li, and improve the safety performance of the battery. Additionally, these dual-functional membranes boost the reaction kinetics and conductivity of the cathode by dispersing the sulfur slurry in the porous membrane framework. As a result, the lithium-sulfur full battery assembled with the CNT@NC@Sn integrated membrane electrode exhibits stable cycling with a reversible capacity of 617.1 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C. The capacity decay rate per cycle is 0.105%, and the N/P ratio is as low as 2.98.

The resultant condensed separators with Co-C coating (Co-C@separator) can effectively decrease the pore size of commercial separators from 200 to 300 nm to 2.2-10 nm. The decreased pore sizes block the shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through the separator, thus solving the annoying 'shuttle effect' via physical confinement. Furthermore, the embedded Co nano-nodes in Co-C polyhedrons are capable of capturing LiPSs via strong chemical adsorption of soluble LiPSs. Through this advantage combined with the rapid Li-ion transport through the intragranular pores between the Co-C polyhedrons, a sulfur-rich cathode (72% sulfur) has achieved outstanding performance when using the Co-C@separator, delivering decent cycling stability (675 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1)) and high rate performance (401 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1)).

The facile and cost-effective bio-inspired method possesses a high product yield of 40.7 wt%. The AAC sample has a high BET surface area of 2269 m(2) g(-1) and large pore volume of 1.05 cm(3) g(-1), which is beneficial to effectively hold the sulfur and restrain the diffusion of polysulfides during the galvanostatic charge/discharge processes using as the cathode matrix for the rechargeable Li-S battery. The pore size distribution of the AAC sample is ranging from 0.6 to 2.0 nm, which leads to the nonconductive sulfur being loaded into the micropores of the carbon matrix in highly dispersed state, having and/or losing electrons easily at the same time. The optimized AAC/S composite material shows an excellent cycle performance and a good rate capability when using as the cathode in Li-S battery. The initial discharge capacity of 1277 mAh g(-1) can be obtained at 0.1 degrees C. A stable discharge capacity of about 710 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 degrees C and the discharge capacity of 613 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 1 degrees C may be achieved after 200 charge/discharge cycles.

However, their practical implementation is hindered because of inherent issues of the technology such as the shuttling effect of the polysulfide intermediates and the formation of dendritic lithium metal (Li-0) deposits during battery operation leading to the short cycle life of the cell. It is generally accepted that the formation of robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on the surface of the Li-0 anode is an effective way to mitigate these issues. Herein, the use of salt additives, lithium ( difluoromethanesulfonyl) (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide {Li[N( SO2CF2H)( SO2CF3)], LiDFTFSI} and lithium tricyanomethanide [LiC(CN)(3), LiTCM], added to the classical solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) comprising lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is proposed, with the aim to improve the quality of the SEI layer on the Li0 anode. Through this approach, SEI layers with good mechanical integrity and Li-ion conductivity are formed thanks to the beneficial anion chemistry of these salt additives, allowing the PEO-based all-solid-state lithium-sulfur cells to be cycled for more than 100 cycles with good rate capability and Coulombic efficiency. These results attest to the great importance of electrolyte additives, even at small doses, to improve the battery performance through the selective modification of SEI components.

However, achieving a scalable synthesis for the sulfur electrode material whilst maintaining a high volumetric energy density remains a serious challenge. Here, a continuous ball-milling route is devised for synthesizing multifunctional FeS2/FeS/S composites for use as high tap density electrodes. These composites demonstrate a maximum reversible capacity of 1044.7 mAh g(-1) and a peak volumetric capacity of 2131.1 Ah L-1 after 30 cycles. The binding direction is also considered here for the first time between dissolved lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and host materials (FeS2 and FeS in this work) as determined by density functional theory calculations. It is concluded that if only one lithium atom of the polysulfide bonds with the sulfur atoms of FeS2 or FeS, then any chemical interaction between these species is weak or negligible. In addition, FeS2 is shown to have a strong catalytic effect on the reduction reactions of LiPSs. This work demonstrates the limitations of a strategy based on chemical interactions to improve cycling stability and offers new insights into the development of high tap density and high-performance sulfur-based electrodes.

In this work, we have designed manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheet functionalized sulfur@ poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) core-shell nanospheres (S@ PEDOT/MnO2) for high performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. A PEDOT layer is used to address the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and acts as a protective layer to prevent dissolution of polysulfides. The MnO2 nanosheets functionalized on PEDOT further provide a high active contact area to enhance the wettability of the electrode materials with electrolytes and further interlink the polymer chains to improve the conductivity and stability of the composite. As a result, S@ PEDOT/MnO2 exhibits an improved capacity of 827 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C (1C = 1673 mA g(-1)) and a further similar to 50% enhancement compared to S@ PEDOT (551 mA h g(-1)) without MnO2 functionalization. In particular, the discharge capacity of S@ PEDOT/MnO2 is 545 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C. Our demonstration here indicates that the functionalization of inorganic nanostructures on conducting polymer coated sulfur nanoparticles is an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical cycling performance and stability of sulfur cathodes for Li-S batteries.

However, challenges remain in achieving high electronic/ionic conductivity and suppressing the shuttle effect, especially for cathodes with high sulfur loading. Here we report a 3D free-standing hierarchical structure of VO2(P) (paramontroseite VO2) nanoparticles grown on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) arrays as a catalytic host for high-performance sulfur cathodes. In this architecture, the VO2(P) nanoparticles function as catalysts to oxidize the LiPS to produce thiosulfate due to the strong chemical interaction. Furthermore, thiosulfates act as a mediator to catenate long-chain LiPS together and convert short-chain Li2S2/Li2S and surface-bound polythionate complexes. Accordingly, the VO2(P)-NCNT/S cathode exhibits excellent performance with high discharge capacity output (approximate to 1200 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C), stable long-term cycling (approximate to 67% retention at 2 C for 500 cycles), and high sulfur loading cycling (initial areal capacity of 10.2 mA h cm(-2) at 0.2 C for 200 cycles). This nanostructure catalytic cathode with high sulfur loadings, as well as stable cycling performances, is attractive for developing practically useable Li-S batteries.

Although various flexible batteries have been explored based on one-dimensional and two-dimensional platforms, developing a high energy density electrode with high structural integrity remains challenging. Herein, a scalable, one-pot wet spinning strategy is used to synthesize a flexible porous cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) for the first time, which consists of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene crumples (GCs) and sulfur powders. The electrode structures are tailored using GCs with different dimensions and functional features that are critical to its robustness under mechanical deformation and electrolyte penetration into the battery components. The optimized rGO/GC/S composite ribbon cathodes deliver a high capacity of 524 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.2 C. A shape-conformable battery prototype comprising an rGO/GC/S cathode and a lithium anode demonstrates a stable discharge characteristic under repeated bending/flattening cycles. The LSB prototype supported by an elastomer presents stable discharge behavior with high mechanical robustness against an extension of up to 50%. The above-mentioned findings shed new light on developing sulfur cathodes for flexible, high performance LSBs based on the rational design of graphene structures.

The incorporation of sulfur and carbon matrices is the most appropriate strategy to contain sulfur and suppress the soluble polysulfide shuttle. However, in the conventional methods including mechanical mixing, heat treatment and wet-chemistry synthesis, it is very difficult to guarantee the precise sulfur content, uniform sulfur distribution, and strong interaction between sulfur and carbon. Hence, a novel synthetic strategy that utilizes supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) to fabricate C@S composites for Li-S batteries has been successfully developed. Taking the advantages of high infiltrability, excellent diffusivity and superior solvability, SC-CO2 not only serves as an intercalator that penetrates into the pores and interlayers of carbon matrices to expand/exfoliate the porous structure and tightly-stacked layered graphite structure, but also plays the role of a marvellous hydrophobic solvent to dissolve sulfur and transfer it into the inner pores and interlayers of carbon matrices. Taking AC@S as an example, it exhibits the highly reversible capacity of 817 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1), and excellent cycling stability with a satisfactory capacity retention of 90.5%. We believe that this novel strategy will open up the prospects for synthesizing more efficient C/S composites to suppress the diffusion of polysulfides and enhance the structural stability and reaction kinetics of the sulfur cathode.

Nanoscale defect engineering of lithium-sulfur battery composite cathodes for improved performance	NANOSCALE			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; GRAPHENE OXIDE; MESOPOROUS CARBONS; POLYSULFIDES; EFFICIENCY; NANOTUBES; FOAMS; HOST	For lithium-sulfur batteries to surpass the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, sulfur-containing cathodes require high sulfur loading (>70 wt%) relative to all inactive components, anchoring sites to prevent polysulfide shuttling, high capacity (>1000 mA h g(-1)), and stable cycling performance. Here we demonstrate a nanomanufacturing route to produce low-density hybrid nanomaterial electrodes that synergize the mechanical and electrical integrity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with the chemical defect properties of carbon nanohorns (CNHs) to produce carefully optimized properties for binder-free lithium-sulfur battery cathodes. High sulfur loadings (>75%) are achieved through a brief (<20 minute) vapor phase treatment at 155 degrees C, with sulfur infiltration kinetics that increase with defect content of the hybrid composite. By controlling the relative concentration of CNHs to CNTs, and hence defect engineering the composite, we determine an optimized hybrid structure with a 7 : 3 relative weight ratio that exhibits a reversible capacity of more than 1200 mA h g(sulfur)(-1) when operated at 0.1C and a capacity retention of over 85% after 100 cycles. The excellent cyclability and high capacity of these electrodes is one of the best reported to date for binder-free carbon composites and we demonstrate this to be due to the role of defects in promoting the retention of high order polysulfides for subsequent conversion to the insoluble low-order polysulfide reaction product. Our work highlights the critical intersection between controllably manufactured compositions of hybrid nanostructures and improved performance in batteries capable of surpassing the energy storage capability of conventional Li-ion.

Here, a novel approach is developed to fabricate high-density graphene bulk materials with ink-bottle-like mesopores by phosphoric acid (H3PO4) activation. These pores can effectively confine the polysulfides due to their unique structure with a wide body and narrow neck, which shows only a 0.05% capacity fade per cycle for 500 cycles (75% capacity retention) for accommodating polysulfides. With a density of 1.16 g cm(-3), a hybrid cathode containing 54 wt% sulfur delivers a high volumetric capacity of 653 mA h cm(-3). As a result, a device-level volumetric energy density as high as 408 W h L-1 is achieved with a cathode thickness of 100 mu m. This is a periodic yet practical advance to improve the volumetric performance of Li-S batteries from a device perspective. This work suggests a design principle for the real use Li-S batteries although there is a long way ahead to bridge the gap between Li-S batteries and Li-ion batteries in volumetric performance.

J	Eng, AYS; Cheong, JL; Lee, SS				Eng, Alex Yong Sheng; Cheong, Jian Liang; Lee, Su Seong			Controlled synthesis of transition metal disulfides (MoS2 and WS2) on carbon fibers: Effects of phase and morphology toward lithium-sulfur battery performance	APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY			English	Article						Transition metal disulfides; Two dimensional materials; Solvothermal synthesis; Synthetic control; Phase engineering; Lithium-sulfur batteries	IN-SITU; NANOSHEETS; 1T-MOS2; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; DICHALCOGENIDES; NANOPARTICLES; INTERLAYER; ELECTRODE; CATHODE; CLOTH	Group 6 transition metal disulfides (TMDs) are highly anisotropic 2D layered nanomaterials, which can adopt diverse phases and morphologies. While a large variety of "top-down" (e.g. chemical intercalation/exfoliation) and "bottom-up" approaches (e.g. colloidal synthesis, chemical vapour deposition) are available to produce different TMDs, it is difficult for a single procedure to access their various phases and morphologies from a common precursor. Herein, we present a unified synthetic scheme based on a solvothermal method, which can be achieved despite using just one common tetrathio-metallate precursor. TMD composition (Mo vs. W), phase (semiconducting vs. metallic), and morphology (edge vs. basal plane orientations) may thus be controlled and grown on supporting carbon fibers. Employing this controllable approach for the first time, we systematically study TMD structure-property relationships toward lithium sulfur battery (LSB) performance, based on their ability to act as polysulfide anchors in LSB cathodes. Using voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic cycling, we observed that the TMD phase plays the most important role influencing cell performance compared to morphology, for both MoS2 and WS2. At high C-rates, 1T-phase edge-oriented polytypes outperformed others due to the combination of its metallic character and preferential edge adsorption. For long-term cycling however, 1T-phase basal-oriented polytypes had the highest capacity retention, attributed to its lower charge transfer resistances. An increased areal capacity of similar to 4 mAh cm(-2) was also demonstrated toward future application of LSBs.

In this paper, the surface modification of MIL-88A(Fe) is carried out by Dawson-type polyoxometalate (POM), and a hollow capsule shell material with P2W18 , Fe3O4, and C components is synthesized by the subsequent carbonization process. When applied as the sulfur host, the hollow capsule shell material can efficiently improve the conductivity of sulfur electrode and restrain the volumetric change of active sulfur while charging and discharging. On this foundation, electrochemical analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation show that the P2W18 on the outer layer of the capsule shell have effective electrocatalytic activity and potent chemical bond on the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which is helpful to block the shuttle effect. Therefore, the as-assembled LSBs display the outstanding specific capacity and prominent cycle stability. Specifically, it delivers an excellent reversible capacity of 1063 mAh/g after 100 cycles of charge-discharge at a rate of 0.5 C, accounting for a preservation by 96% in comparison to that of the initial cycle. Moreover, even after 2000 cycles at 1 C, the reversible specific capacity of 585 mAh/g can still be maintained with an average decay rate of only 0.021%.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is hindered by several obstacles, such as the insulating nature of elemental sulfur and the high solubility of lithium polysulfide products. In this work, a new type of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) microsphere was synthesized successfully and used as a carbon framework for the sulfur cathode of lithium sulfur batteries. Commercial aqueous-dispersed MWCNTs of low cost are easily accessible for the large-scale production of the carbon skeleton through a simple spray drying approach. The as-prepared carbon framework shows a porous microspherical architecture with the particle size of around several micrometers, and the MWCNTs in it are intertwined to construct a three-dimensional (3D) continuous electronic conductive network. For the sulfur cathode, the C/S microspheres (MS-C/S) were facilely prepared by a melt-diffusion method. The obtained MS-C/S electrode displays excellent cycling stability and rate capability. The electrode with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2) shows an initial discharge capacity of 983 mA h g(-1) and a stable capacity of 858 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.2C. Even when the current rate increases to 0.5C, a stable capacity of 806 mA h g(-1) is maintained over 100 cycles.

Due to this unique three-layer-structure, the discharge specific capacity of Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite cathode retained at 554 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, which represents 68.8% retention of the initial discharge specific capacity. In comparison, the Sulfur Polypyrrole composite cathode, with the same components as Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite, but without the three-layer-structure, has the discharge specific capacity of 370 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, which is 32.3% retention of the initial discharge specific capacity. Therefore, it can be concluded that the unique three-layer-structure plays an essential role in improving the performance of the Lithium/Sulfur batteries. Moreover, the effects of LiNO3 additive in the electrolyte on coulombic efficiency are discussed to further confirm the containment function of the external layer of polypyrrole in the Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite, which is the evidence that the external layer of polypyrrole can effectively confine the dissolved polysulfides.

The loading of sulfur and the weight percentage of sulfur in the cathode usually have a significant influence on the energy density. Herein, we report an easy synthesis of a self-supporting sulfur@ graphene oxide-few-wall carbon nanotube (S@GO-FWCNT) composite cathode film, wherein an aluminum foil current collector is replaced by FWCNTs and sulfur particles are uniformly wrapped by graphene oxide along with FWCNTs. The 10 wt% FWCNT matrix through ultrasonication not only provided self-supporting properties without the aid of metallic foil, but also increased the electrical conductivity. The resulting S@GO-FWCNT composite electrode showed high rate performance and cycle stability up to similar to 385.7 mA h g(electrode) similar to 1 after 500 cycles and close to similar to 0.04% specific capacity degradation per cycle, which was better than a S@GO composite electrode (353.1 mA h g(electrode)(-1)). This S@ GO-FWCNT composite self-supporting film is a promising cathode material for high energy density rechargeable Li-S batteries.

Despite great efforts devoted to solving the polysulfide shuttle between the cathode and anode electrodes, it remains a serious challenge to build highly-stable lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein we demonstrate a strategy of introducing an ion selective membrane to improve the stability and coulombic efficiency of lithium-sulfur batteries. The sulfonate-ended perfluoroalkyl ether groups on the ionic separators are connected by pores or channels that are around several nanometers in size. These SO3- groups-coated channels allow ion hopping of positively charged species (Li+) but reject hopping of negative ions, such as polysulfide anions (S-n(2-)) in this specific case due to the coulombic interactions. Consequently, this cation permselective membrane acts as an electrostatic shield for polysulfide anions, and confines the polysulfides on the cathode side. An ultra-low decay rate of 0.08% per cycle is achieved within the initial 500 cycles for the membrane developed in this work, which is less than half that of the routine membranes. Such an ion selective membrane is versatile for various electrodes and working conditions, which is promising for the construction of high performance batteries.

The ether with partially fluorinated structure reduces the conductivity of the electrolyte but increases distinctly the reversible capacity and coulombic efficiency of the cell, meanwhile decreases the self-discharging loss at the rest period of the cell. The limited dissolution of polysulfides into electrolyte due to the presence of TFTFE is an important factor for the improvement of overall cell performance. Moreover, TFTFE is found to modify the surface film on Li anode greatly, blocking the access of polysulfides to metallic Li and side-reactions between them. TFTFE acts as both polysulfides-restraining solvent and film-forming agent in a Li/S cell system, reflecting the particular functions of the fluorinated ether.

However, rapid capacity decay and short cycle life, mainly resulting from polysulfide dissolution, remains a great challenge for practical applications. Herein, we present a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived Co9S8 array anchored onto a chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown three-dimensional graphene foam (Co9S8-3DGF) as an efficient sulfur host for long-life Li-S batteries with good performance. Without polymeric binders, conductive additives, or metallic current collectors, the free-standing Co9S8-3DGF/S cathode achieves a high areal capacity of 10.9 mA hr cm(-2) even at a very high sulfur loading (10.4 mg cm(-2)) and sulfur content (86.9 wt%).

After being loaded with sulfur, the as-obtained 3D-S-RGO composite was used as a cathode for Li-S batteries. Due to its unique 3D-structured porous carbon layers with a high surface area, a high sulfur loading (75.8%) was achieved. More importantly, its 3D structure can also serve as a polysulfide storeroom to relieve the shuttle effect. Therefore, compared with regular sulfur-loaded reduced graphene oxide (S-RGO), the 3D-S-RGO cathode exhibits a greatly improved discharge capacity and cycling stability. The 3D-S-RGO cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1140 mAh g (1) at 0.2 C and remains at 790 mAh g (1) after 200 cycles. This study shows that the 3D structure is essential for improving the performance of graphene-based cathodes in Li-S batteries. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With the merits of a high sulfur content (77%), uniform distribution and strong C-S bonds achieved by this method, the as-prepared materials demonstrate excellent performance in lithium-sulfur batteries. The electrode delivers high specific capacities at various C-rates (e. g. about 1160 and 590 mA h g(-1) at current densities of 0.1 and 2.0 A g(-1), respectively) and remarkable capacity retention, remaining above 857 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at a high rate of 0.5 A g(-1). This electrochemical strategy is industrially viable and scalable, and thus may pave a new way to push the commercialization of Li-S batteries.

However, dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LPS) into electrolyte causes undesirable effects, resulting in loss of active materials, low Coulombic efficiency, and fast capacity fading. To address these issues, designed interlayers are inserted between a separator and S cathode to evaluate the effect of blocking of long chain LPS and catalytic conversion of LPS to Li2S2/Li2S on battery performance. In order to amplify the effect of interlayer, the Ni2P nanoparticles are electrochemically deposited on carbon fabric (CF) which exhibit excellent adsorption and conversion effect of LPS. A cell fabricated with the Ni2P@CF interlayer allows remarkable improvement in the capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle at 1C for 1000 cycles and outstanding high rate capability. The cell delivered a capacity retention of 64% employing a current density of 8 C.

However, practically, Li-S batteries suffer from short cycling life and low sulfur utilization, particularly in the case of high-sulfur-loaded cathodes. Here, we report on a light-weight nanoporous graphitic carbon nitride (high surface-area g-C3N4) that enables a sulfur electrode with an ultralow long-term capacity fade rate of 0.04% per cycle over 1500 cycles at a practical C/2 rate. More importantly, it exhibits good high-sulfur-loading areal capacity (up to 3.5 mAh cm(-2)) with stable cell performance. We demonstrate the strong chemical interaction of g-C3N4 with polysulfides using a combination of spectroscopic experimental studies and first-principles calculations. The 53.5% concentration of accessible pyridinic nitrogen polysulfide adsorption sites is shown to be key for the greatly improved cycling performance compared to that of N-doped carbons.

Such corncob-like porous and channel structures exhibit unique physicochemical properties, and a high density of pores improves the surface roughness of the materials, so that the materials have a very high sulfur-carrying capacity. Confinement effects provided by porous containers and dispersed channels not only buffer volumetric expansion of sulfur during cycles, but also facilitate electrolyte transport to some extent and increase the rate of utilization of active substances. Furthermore, S-C bonds can enhance chemical adsorption of carbon for sulfur and improve the structural stability of the materials. The results indicate that PCFs, as sulfur carriers, provide a good electrochemical performance. The specific discharge capacity of sulfur-carrying FCFs (PCF/S) at a high current density of 1.1 C is still higher than that of the sulfur-carrying carbon fibers (CF/S) at a lower current density of 1.0 C. After 300 cycles, the specific capacity of the PCF/Sat 1.1 C remains at 660 mAh g(-1)while that of CF/S at 1.0 C is only 246 mAh g(-1).

Herein, cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles embedded into carbon spheres (CoP@C) as an interlayer on commercial poly-propylene (PP) separator are designed through a facile co-precipitation method to address the above issues. The spherical CoP@C composite with numerous active sites can not only capture the LiPSs via strong chemical anchoring ability effectively, but also have good electrocatalytic ability to decrease the redox conversion barrier and enhance Li+ ion transport, ultimately promote the LiPSs conversion kinetics. Therefore, the Li-S batteries with CoP@C-PP separator show excellent electrochemical performance with high initial capacity of 1213 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 degrees C, excellent cyclability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.058% per cycling upon long-term 800 cycles at 1.0 degrees C, and a superior rate performance with 654 mAh g(-1) even at 5.0 degrees C.

Cyclic voltammograms (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) suggest that the electrochemical stability of the S-OMCs is obviously superior to the pristine sulfur cathode. The S-OMCs composite shows excellent cycling performance with a reversible discharge capacity of about 800 mAhg(-1) after 25 cycles. This would be attributed to an appropriate conductive structure in which the active sulfur is highly dispersed in and contacted with the OMCs matrix. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The meso- and macropores in PN-V2O5 were confirmed by pore size distribution, which provided the favorable space to accommodate sulfur. The X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the crystal structures of S and V2O5 could be preserved below the heating temperature of 160 degrees C and that high heating temperature (200 degrees C) will result in reaction between S and V2O5. The pore size distribution curves of S/C/PN-V2O5 composites revealed that the penetrated S in PN-V2O5 pores mainly occupied the mesopores and macropores, which was further confirmed by a typical cross-sectional PN-V2O5 with Auger analysis. The S/C/PN-V2O5 composite cathode exhibited a discharge capacity of 632 mAh g(-1) after 60 cycles at the current density of 100 mA g(-1) and the capacity retention of S/C/PN-V2O5 electrode was 27.3% higher than that of SIC electrode, demonstrating a better cycling performance.

However, lithium-sulfur batteries still encounter a series of challenges such as low conductivity and serious volumetric expansion of sulfur during the discharge process as well as the stubborn shuttle effect of polysulfides. Such problems have greatly plagued the real applications of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we have synthesized below-5-nm g-C3N4 nanodots based on a pore confinement effect, and they are embedded in a MOF-derived N, S co-doped hollow porous carbon shell (CN@NSHPC) via a unique double solvent-induced strategy. CN@NSHPC displays superior lithium polysulfide (LiPS) adsorptivity and a high sulfur loading of 73%. When applied as an electrode in lithium-sulfur batteries, the CN@NSHPC electrode delivers an excellent specific capacity of 1447 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, good rate capability of 387 mA h g(-1) at 5C, and excellent cycling stability, specifically, only 0.048% decay per cycle at 1.0C over 500 cycles. This proposed strategy provides an insight into a new pathway to construct co-doped carbon hollow nanostructure and nanodot materials by the pore confinement effect.

Novel design and mechanisms to encapsulate lithium polysulfides are greatly desired by high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries towards practical applications. Herein, we report a strategy of utilizing anthraquinone, a natural abundant organic molecule, to suppress dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides species through redox reactions during cycling. The keto groups of anthraquinone play a critical role in forming strong Lewis acid-based chemical bonding. This mechanism leads to a long cycling stability of sulfur-based electrodes. With a high sulfur content of similar to 73%, a low capacity decay of 0.019% per cycle for 300 cycles and retention of 81.7% over 500 cycles at 0.5 C rate can be achieved. This finding and understanding paves an alternative avenue for the future design of sulfur-based cathodes toward the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries.

In principle, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a strong potential for improving sulfur usage because of their high electrical conductivity. Furthermore, opening holes in CNTs or creating pores on the walls is also a useful approach to not only enhance the diffusion of Li ions, but also enable more sulfur to fill the interior of the CNTs, which would be beneficial in retaining the soluble poly-sulfide intermediates and accommodate volume variations. Herein, we designed a mild one-step oxidation approach to create porous CNTs (PCNTs) through a chemical reaction between CNTs and rare oxygen sourced from a nebulized water stream at high temperatures. The higher specific surface area and pore volume values confirmed that PCNTs had significant porosity, compared with raw CNTs. When the PCNTs-S composites were tested as cathode materials in Li-S batteries, the cathode with 78 wt% S content exhibited an initial reversible capacity of 1382 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C. Furthermore, a reversible capacity of 150 mA h g(-1) can be preserved, even at a very high current rate of 15 C. More importantly, it is also confirmed that a cathode with 89 wt% S content unexpectedly delivered a reversible capacity as high as 1165 mA h g(sulfur)(-1)/830 mA h g(electrode)(-1) at the initial cycle, and 792 mA h g(sulfur)(-1)/564 mA h g(electrode)(-1) after 200 cycles at a current rate of 0.2 C. To the best of our knowledge, such a high rate performance (15 C) and S loading (89 wt%) in cathodes of advanced Li-S batteries have been infrequently reported in previous research.

However, the structure of carbon materials and the way that they are packed are important factors, because they determine the number and size of pores of future layers and, consequently, the permeability of ions. This work presents interlinked carbon nanocages (IL-CNCs) as the coating materials for the separators of Li-S batteries. The surface morphology, pore structure, and cyclic performances as well as the rate properties of the composite separators were fully analyzed. IL-CNCs coatings offer abundant surfaces and an interface to trap polysulfide as well as a long transmission distance to prevent polysulfide ions from penetrating the membrane.

Cellulose Separators With Integrated Carbon Nanotube Interlayers for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: An Investigation into the Complex Interplay between Cell Components	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTROLYTE; SHUTTLE; PERFORMANCE; INTERPHASE; RESISTANCE; ANODE; LINO3	This work aims to address two major roadblocks in the development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries: the inefficient deposition of Li on the metallic Li electrode and the parasitic "polysulfide redox shuttle". These roadblocks are here approached, respectively, by the combination of a cellulose separator with a cathode-facing conductive porous carbon interlayer, based on their previously reported individual benefits. Both approaches result in significant improvements in cycle life in test cells with positive electrodes with practically relevant specifications. Despite the substantially prolonged cycle life, the combination of the interlayer and cellulose separator generates an increase in polysulfide shuttle current, leading to greatly reduced Coulombic efficiency. Based on XPS analyses, the latter is ascribed to a change in the composition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Li electrode. At the same time, the rate of electrolyte decomposition is found to be lower in cells with cellulose-based separators, which corroborates the observation of longer cycle life. These seemingly contradictory and counterintuitive observations demonstrate the complicated interactions between the cell components in the Li-S system and how strategies aiming to mitigate one unwanted process may exacerbate another. This study demonstrates the value of a holistic approach to the development of Li-S chemistry. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

A variety of adsorbents have been applied as interlayers to alleviate the shuttle effect. Nevertheless, the unsuccessful oxidation of Li2S on interlayers leads to loss of active materials and blocks Li ion transport. In this work, a MoN-based interlayer sandwiched between the C-S cathode and the separator is developed. Such an interlayer not only strongly binds lithium polysulfides via Mo-S bonding but also efficiently accelerates the decomposition of Li2S. The acceleration mechanism toward Li2S decomposition is determined to be a combination of contributions of catalytic cleavage of Li-S bond in Li2S based on the proposed covalence-activation mechanism and rapid migration of the produced Li ions. As a result, the C-S cathodes with the as-developed interlayer manifest a negligible charging potential barrier and outstanding cycling stability with a very low capacity fading rate of 0.023% per cycle during 1500 cycles at 1 C. High areal capacity of 6.02 mAh cm(-2) is achieved for high sulfur loading of 7.0 mg cm(-2) after cycling at 0.1 C. The material and strategy demonstrated in this work can open the door toward developing shuttle suppression interlayers without impairing cathode performance.

However, the low surfur utilization and shuttling of lithium polysulfides hinder their practical applications. Herein, a multifunctional interlayer composed of Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 nanosheets grown on carbon fiber cloth is reported. Fe-doping in the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets improves the interactions and adsorption of polysulfides. Promoted reaction kinetics, higher rating performance and more stable long-term cycling are achieved. As a result, the Fe-Ni(OH)2/CFC interlayer enables an initial capacity of 1318 mAh g-1 at 0.5C, and a capacity retention of 923 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles with a low capacity fading rate.

Herein, a 1D pi-d conjugated metal-organic framework (MOF), Ni-MOF-1D, is presented as an efficient sulfur host to overcome these limitations. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Ni-MOF-1D is characterized by a remarkable binding strength for trapping soluble LiPS species. Ni-MOF-1D also acts as an effective catalyst for S reduction during the discharge process and Li2S oxidation during the charging process. In addition, the delocalization of electrons in the pi-d system of Ni-MOF-1D provides a superior electrical conductivity to improve electron transfer. Thus, cathodes based on Ni-MOF-1D enable LSBs with excellent performance, for example, impressive cycling stability with over 82% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 C, superior rate performance of 575 mAh g(-1) at 8 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.63 mAh cm(-2) under raised sulfur loading of 6.7 mg cm(-2). The strategies and advantages here demonstrated can be extended to a broader range of pi-d conjugated MOFs materials, which the authors believe have a high potential as sulfur hosts in LSBs.

It has been found that only N-G with clustered pyridinic N-dopants can strongly attract LiPSs with large enough binding energies to effectively anchor the soluble LiPSs, due to (i) an enhanced attraction between Li ions in LiPSs and pyridinic N-dopants and/or (ii) an additional attraction between S anions in LiPSs and Li ions captured by pyridinic N-dopants. This study has, for the first time, provided a fundamental understanding on the origin of the effective anchoring of LiPSs by N-doped carbon materials, which suppresses the shuttling of LiPSs and produces significant improvement in the cycling performance of Li-S batteries. These findings can also guide the design of more effective N-doped carbons or other N-rich materials for Li-S batteries, preventing the undesirable LiPS shuttling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Many recent investigations have focused on the development of methods to wrap the sulfur material with a diffusion barrier layer. However, there is a trade-off between a perfect preassembled wrapping layer and electrolyte infiltration into the wrapped sulfur cathode. Here, we demonstrate an in situ wrapping approach to construct a compact layer on carbon/sulfur composite particles with an imperfect wrapping layer. This special configuration suppresses the shuttle effect while allowing polysulfide diffusion within the interior of the wrapped composite particles. As a result, the wrapped cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries greatly improves the Coulombic efficiency and cycle life. Importantly, the capacity decay of the cell at 1000 cycles is as small as 0.03% per cycle at 1672 mA g(-1).

To address these issues, we have successfully designed a freestanding graphitic porous carbon nanofibers piece, which can accommodate high sulfur loading up to 70%, and be served as the polysulfides reservoirs to alleviate shuttle effect. Furthermore, the 3D graphitic porous carbon nanofibers can facilitate the diffusion and transport of electrons and ions owing to the superior electrical conductivity and interconnected porous nature resulting in improved electrochemical performance. The obtained sulfur and porous carbon nanofibers (S@P-CNFs) composite cathode shows high rate capability of 670 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and excellent cycling stability of 720 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1C.

Herein, cobalt (Co) nanoparticles embedded inside nitrogen (N)-doped hierarchical porous carbon (MgCo-HC) are prepared via one-pot approach. As a result, MgCo-HC unique structure with the large surface area and Co, N-doping is proposed for the strong physical/chemical ad-sorption of PSs, high conductivity, fast redox reaction kinetics and the high S utilization. The resultant S cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 1086.4 mA h/g at 0.1 C, low-capacity fading rate of 0.041% per cycle over 880 cycles at 2 C, and superior rate performance up to 5 C. More intriguingly, the S/MgCo-HC electrode delivers reversible area capacities of 5.1 and 5.5 mA h/cm(2) at 0.1 C under high S loading and learn electrolyte condition, respectively. Furthermore, the assembled Li-S soft-packaged battery is also readily assembled, which highlights stable electrochemical properties under folding conditions. This work provides a simple strategy to design advanced S hosts for the practical application of Li-S batteries with excellent electrochemical performance. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here a convenient method is designed to fabricate the 2D louts-like N-Co2VO4-Co heterostructures with well-abundant interfaces and oxygen vacancies (V-o), endowing the materials with both "sulfiphilic" and "lithiophilic" features. When employed as the modification layer coated on commercial Celgard 2400 separator, the as-prepared N-Co2VO4-Co/PP with synergistic adsorption-electrocatalysis effects achieves desirable sulfur electrochemistry, thus showing a high initial discharge capacity of 1466.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and stable cycle life with a fade rate of 0.03% per cycle over 1000 cycle at 3.0 C. Moreover, a superior areal capacity of 12.84 mAh cm(-2) is preserved under high sulfur loading of 14.3 mg cm(-2).

J	Wei, WL; Liu, P				Wei, Wenli; Liu, Peng			Rational porous design for carbon nanotubes derived from tubular polypyrrole as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries	MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS			English	Article						Lithium sulfur batteries; Pore size; N; O-doped porous CNTs; Polypyrrole; KOH activation	PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN; FABRICATION; COMPOSITE; CATHODE; CORE	Heteroatom doped porous carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely used as sulfur host and stable polysulfide reservoir in the Li-S batteries. In the present work, the effect of the pore size in the porous CNTs on the battery performance of the CNTs-based sulfur cathodes was investigated by comparing the electrochemical performance of the N, O-doped porous CNTs, which were designed by the carbonization of the PPy nanotubes as precursor with different amounts of KOH as activating agent. The results showed that sulfur could completely fill the mesopores and hollow cavity of the mesoporous carbon nanotubes (PNCT-2) prepared with severe KOH activation, with theoretical calculated sulfur content. In comparison with the S-PCNT-1 cathode with sulfur coated onto the outer surface of the microporous carbon nanotubes (PNCT-1), the S-PCNT-2 cathode possessed higher specific capacity and rate capacity, as well as better cyclic life. Such features are ascribed to the large specific surface area and the appropriate pore size of the PCNT-2, which provides an efficient diffusion path for the sulfur and electrolyte as well as polysulfide trap suppressing the "shuttle effect" efficiently.

Nonetheless, most of the previous successful demonstrations have been based on limited areal capacities. For realistic battery applications, however, the chronic issues from both the anode (lithium dendrite growth) and the cathode (lithium polysulfide dissolution) need to be readdressed under much higher loading of sulfur active material. To this end, the current study integrates the following three approaches in a systematic manner: 1) the sulfur electrode material with diminished lithium polysulfide dissolution by the covalently bonded sulfur-carbon microstructure, 2) mussel-inspired polydopamine coating onto the separator that suppresses lithium dendrite growth by wet-adhesion between the separator and Li metal, and 3) addition of cesium ions (Cs+) to the electrolyte to repel incoming Li ions and thus prevent Li dendrite growth. This combined strategy resolves the long-standing problems from both electrodes even under the very large sulfur-carbon composite loading of 17 mg cm(-2) in the sulfur electrode, enabling the highest areal capacity (9 mAh cm(-2)) to date while preserving stable cycling performance.

To overcome this problem, an ideal anchoring materials is urgent. In the current work, we explore the potential application of BC2N allotropes (approximated by Type-I and Type-II structures) as anchoring materials for Li-S batteries by using first-principles method with van der Waals interaction. Type-I is a direct-bandgap semiconductor, while type-II is semi-metallic due to inversion symmetry of its structure. They show remarkable but not too strong chemical interaction with S-8 and Li2Sx clusters and enhanced electrical conductivity. In addition, the introduction of dopants and defects result in semiconductor-to-metal transition on type-I BC2N, and enhancement of binding energies and still keep intact Li2Sx clusters. Our findings demonstrate that defective and doped BC2N monolayers are promising anchoring materials for Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it is a challenge to develop high performance electrodes for commercialization of rechargeable Li-S battery system because of the dissolution of polysulfides during charging and discharging process and the insulating nature of sulfur. In this work, we firstly demonstrate the novel host material of -molybdenum carbide/carbon nanofibers (-Mo2C/CNFs) with good electrical conductivity and porous structure, which is synthesized via the facile one-pot electrospinning method and subsequent thermal treatment to impregnate sulfur in Li-S battery. The as-prepared -Mo2C/CNFs act as polysulfide reservoirs to alleviate the shuttle effect by the physical and chemical adsorption. Meanwhile, the mesoporous structure of -Mo2C/CNFs can facilitate the electron transport for surface reactions and improve the reaction kinetics. It is demonstrated that -Mo2C/CNFs/sulfur composite displays a high lithium-ion diffusion coefficient, a low interfacial resistance and excellent electrochemical performance than that of CNFs/sulfur and pure sulfur.

However, the practical utilization of lithium-sulfur batteries is compromised by fast capacity decay, limited sulfur loading and significant polysulfide shuttling. Herein, we designed and prepared a free-standing lithium-sulfur electrode by loading sulfur into a hybrid material (Mo3Ni3N/Mo2C-CBC/S) constructed by growing Mo3Ni3N/Mo2C nanoparticles on carbonized bacterial cellulose film (CBC). High sulfur content up to 70 wt% and high areal sulfur loading of 15.5 mg cm(-2) in Mo3Ni3N/Mo2C-CBC/S membrane are achieved. Reversible specific capacities of 1218 and 823 mA h g(-1) are delivered for current rates of 0.1 and 1.0 C, respectively. A high capacity over 500 mA h g(-1) is retained after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. The superior electrochemical performance of Mo3Ni3N/Mo2C-CBC/S composite is attributed to the unique structure feature and the synergistic effect of the Mo3Ni3N and Mo2C nanoparticles. The Mo3Ni3N/Mo2C component could suppress the dissolution and shuttling of the polysulfides and Mo2C could improve the electronic conductivity of the composite, consequently contributing to the excellent electrochemical performance of the composite.

However, the low areal sulfur loading and notorious shuttle effect severely restrict the energy density and practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we employ a rational design concept to fabricate a nitrogen-doped carbon foam/sulfur cathode decorated with rGO based on commercial melamine foam. The as-prepared cathodes have robust flexibility and abundant internal voids that can enable them to be directly used as advanced self-supported high sulfur-containing electrodes with a loading of 3.2-8.8 mg cm(-2), meanwhile significantly accommodating the large volume change of sulfur. Based on the in situ nitrogen-doping and rGO decoration, the shuttle effect is also effectively inhibited via the chemical adsorption and physical immobilization of lithium polysulfide. Additionally, the close combination of a carbon skeleton and highly conductive rGO forms an interconnected 3D network that boosts electron and ion transport. Owing to these unique merits, the resultant cathodes deliver high capacity and excellent cycling performances with an ultrahigh capacity retention of 91% and a highly stable reversible capacity of 520 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.5C. Even with a high sulfur loading (6.4 mg cm(-2)) and sulfur content (74%), a high initial discharge capacity of 913 mA h g(-1) (5.8 mA h cm(-2)) and an improved reversible capacity of 720 mA h g(-1) (4.6 mA h cm(-2)) are still achieved after 50 cycles at 0.1C.

Towards Next Generation Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: Non-Conventional Carbon Compartments/Sulfur Electrodes and Multi-Scale Analysis	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTRICAL ENERGY-STORAGE; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; FLUORINATED ETHER; IMPEDANCE RESPONSE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CATHODE	In this work, a novel heterofunctional, bimodally-porous carbon morphology, termed the carbon compartment (CC), is utilized as a sulfur host within a lithium-sulfur battery cathode. A multi-scale model explores the physics and chemistry of the lithium-sulfur battery cathode. The CCs are synthesized through a rapid, low cost process to improve electrode-electrolyte interfacial contact and accommodate volumetric expansion associated with sulfide formation. The CCs demonstrate controllable sulfur loading and ca. 700 mAh g(-1) (at 47%-wt S) reversible capacity with high coulombic efficiency due to their unique structures. Density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics characterize the interface between the C/S composite and electrolyte during the sulfur reduction mechanism. Stochastic realizations of 3D electrode microstructures are reconstructed based on representative SEM micrographs to study the influence of solid sulfur loading and lithium sulfide precipitation on microstructural and electrochemical properties. A macroscale electrochemical performance model is developed to analyze the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. The combined multi-scale simulation studies explain key fundamentals of sulfur reduction and its relation to the polysulfide shuttle mechanism: how the process is affected due to the presence of carbon substrate, thermodynamics of lithium sulfide formation and deposition on carbon, and microstructural effects on the overall cell performance.

S nanoparticle is uniformly decorated on the graphene surface, and PANI nanowires cover the graphene/S surface. When used as cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, the specific ternary composite achieves excellent electrochemical performance with high capacity and improved cycling stability. The graphene/S/PANI sample delivers a specific capacity of up to 837 mAh g(-1) after a few cycles at 0.1C, which is considerably higher than that delivered by the graphene/S sample. In addition, the graphene/S/PANI sample and the graphene/S sample show improved cycling stability with improved Coulombic efficiency compared with pure S sample. This observation indicates the successful prevention of the polysulfide species diffusion owing to graphene introduction. Furthermore, the activation mechanism of graphene/S is studied through morphology change during cycling, which demonstrates that activation is ascribed to the gradual spread of S on the graphene surface during cycling.

The extended skeleton of PAF-41 is constructed by N-bridged biphenyl groups to generate a consecutive conjugative electronic structure. The hierarchical porous skeleton and the presence of N atoms effectively confine the electroactive species by synergistic physisorption and chemisorption to alleviate the shuttle effect that is induced by the soluble polysulfides. These features render the sulfur impregnated PAF-41 (SPAF-41) improved lithium-sulfur battery performances, especially the cycling stability. SPAF-41 composite cathode with high sulfur loading of 72wt% exhibits enhanced rate capability and excellent cycling performance. The cell delivers a high capacity of 725.8mAhg(-1) at 0.5 degrees C in the first cycle and sustains a reversible capacity of 491.4mAhg(-1) after 500 charge-discharge cycles. A low decay rate of 0.06% per cycle is achieved. The well conductive PAF-41 support bestows the cell high Coulombic efficiency of 97.36%.

However, the severe shuttle effect and poor conductivity of polysulfides greatly hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this study, we have employed the first-principles calculations to propose a promising anchoring material of boron-phosphide (BP) monolayer for Li-S batteries. The anchoring behaviors and electronic properties of lithium polysulfides on the BP monolayer have been investigated. The results verify that the BP monolayer can be regarded as a moderate anchoring material because the adsorption energy of the polysulfide species on the BP monolayer is in the range of 0.57-2.85 eV. Such a moderate anchoring material is suggested to be the best choice for battery electrode. By analyzing the components of van der Waals, electrostatic and chemical interactions, the complicated anchoring mechanisms are explored. Furthermore, the adsorption of lithium polysulfides can reduce the band gap of BP monolayer, exhibiting enhanced performance of electronic conductivity. Our results of the good anchoring performance and the enhanced electronic conductivity suggest that the BP monolayer has great promise as a cathode anchoring material for Li-S batteries, which could inspire more experimental and theoretical studies to explore and develop the potential of other 2D sheets in energy storage systems.

However, the battery technologies have often suffered from a short cycle life and poor rate stability arising from the well-known "polysulfide shuttle" effect. Here, we report a novel cell design by sandwiching a sp(3) boron based single ion conducting polymer electrolyte film between two carbon films to fabricate a composite separator for lithium-sulfur batteries. The dense negative charges uniformly distributed in the electrolyte membrane inherently prohibit transport of polysulfide anions formed in the cathode inside the polymer matrix and effectively blocks polysulfide shuttling. A battery assembled with the composite separator exhibits a remarkably long cycle life at high charge/discharge rates.

When used as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries, Fe2O3@rGO shows a high specific capacity of 400.5 mAh g(-1) at 2 C after 500 cycles. The prominent performance is due to the collaborative assembly of rGO, which provides stable structural support and favourable conductivity, and core-shelled Fe2O3 microspheres, which are certified to have a strong interaction with polysulfides. The loose and stable skeletons of highly electroconductive rGO can offer a conducive framework for rapid ion/electron transport. Meanwhile, the unique core-shelled structure of Fe2O3 with the ample void space can anchor polysulfides through the strong chemical adsorption and buffer the mechanical stresses caused by volume expansion during the charge and discharge processes. Moreover, Fe2O3 promotes the transformation of polysulfides to insoluble LiPSs during the discharging process, effectively alleviating the shuttling of the polysulfides.

A key aspect of this study is the deposition process, which provides a uniform and fine highly porous microstructure for the cathode. The electrophoretic process is simple, less energy intensive with more control of the C-S ratios and particle sizes than some of the reported methods. The study investigates the performance of this cathode material against a pre-lithiated silicon anode as well as against conventional Li foil anodes. With the conventional Li anodes the results (an energy density of about 690 +/- 10 W h kg(-1)) are comparable to those currently in the literature for full cells. With pre-lithiated Si anodes, the electrophoretic architecture gives improved voltages and improved cycling stability compared to other studies where complex C-S architectures are used, and this appears to be related in part to lower S dissolution in these deposited structures. Overall, the results indicated the strength of the simple electrophoretic process for preparation of the carbon-sulfur cathode material.	[Sonia, T.

However, the issues associated with lithium anodes remain unsolved owing to the immature lithium anode construction and protection technology, which leads to internal short circuits, poor capacity retention, and low coulombic efficiency for high-sulfur-loading Li-S batteries. Herein, a highly stable 3D lithium carbon fiber composite (3D LiCF) anode for high-sulfur-loading Li-S batteries was demonstrated, in which a self-formed hybrid solid-electrolyte protection layer was constructed on a lithium metal surface through codeposition of thiophenolate ions and inorganic lithium salts by using diphenyl disulfide as a co-additive in the electrolyte. The aromatic components from thiophenolate could improve the stability of the protection layer, and the 3D structure of the carbon fiber could effectively buffer the volume effect during lithium cycling. A Li-S battery based on a 3D LiCF anode exhibited excellent cycling stability with an energy efficiency of 89.2% for 100cycles in terms of a high energy density of 22.3mWhcm(-2) (10mAhcm(-2) area capacity of lithium cycling). This contribution demonstrates versatile and ingenious strategies for the construction of a 3D lithium anode structure and protection layer, providing an effective solution for practical stable Li-S batteries.

Sulfur/porous carbon composites were synthesized by thermally treating a mixture of sublimed sulfur and porous carbon. The morphology, structure, and electrochemical performance of the composite were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and a variety of electrochemical techniques. The electrochemical measurements show that the SPC2 electrode presents a more favorable electrochemical kinetics than the SPC1 electrode. In comparison with SPC1, it is shown that the rate of Li+ diffusion with SPC2 is significantly higher and the charge transfer resistance is much lower. The PC2 with high surface area (735.2 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume (1.56 cm(3) g(-1)) not only increases the electronic conductivity of composites, but also facilitates transfer of the Li ion in the composite electrode.

The OCT possessed large specific area and pore volume, which could effectively store sulfur. The method was clean, facile and low cost. Moreover, the S@OCT composite exhibited admirable electrochemical performances. The S@OCT with 65%(w/w) sulfur delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1 255.2 mAh.g(-1) (1.8 mAh.cm(-2)) and retained 756.9 mAh.g(-1) (1.09 mAh.cm(-1)) at the current rate of 0.2C after 100 cycles with a high coulomb efficiency. What's more, when tested at 5C, its initial capacity was up to 649.1 mAh.g(-1) (0.93 mA h.cm(-2)) and retained 504.2 mAh.g(-1) (0.72 mAh.cm(-2)) after 100 cycles.

However, the issues of shuttle effect of polysulfide, poor conductivity of sulfur, and volume expansion during lithiation/delithiation seriously restrict the development of Li-S batteries. Inspired by the strong chemical absorption between metal oxides and polysulfides, a jujube pit like Fe3O4/C composite derived from iron-based metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF) are applied as efficient sulfur host in Li-S batteries in this work. Benefitting from the strong chemical bond between iron ion and polysulfides, as well as the interaction between oxygen anion and lithium ion, the Fe3O4/C composite can immobilize the sulfur and inhibit the diffusion of polysulfides efficiently. In addition, the carbon component not only improves the electrical conductivity, but also serves as buffer layer to accommodate the volume variation upon charging/discharging. Consequently, such Fe3O4/C/S cathode shows a high initial specific capacity of 1324mAh/g at a current density of 0.05 C and could retain a specific capacity of 642mAh/g after 300 cycles at current density of 1 C, corresponding to a low fading rate of 0.072% per cycle.

Novel Composite Polymer Electrolytes of PVdF-HFP Derived by Electrospinning with Enhanced Li-Ion Conductivities for Rechargeable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						lithium-sulfur battery; composite polymer electrolyte; nanoparticle fillers; polymer membranes; low electrolyte (E)/sulfur (S) ratio; mechanical properties; electrochemical stability	CATHODE MATERIALS; CARBON NANOTUBES; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; SOLID ELECTROLYTES; PHASE INVERSION; PERFORMANCE; MEMBRANES; FTIR; TIO2; POLYSULFIDES	Composites of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoro propylene) (PVdF-HFP) incorporating 10 wt % bis-(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and 10 wt % particles of nanoparticulate silica (nm-SiO2), nanoparticulate titania (nm-TiO2), and fumed silica (f-SiO2) were prepared by electrospinning. These membranes served as host matrix for the preparation of composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) following activation with lithium sulfur battery electrolyte comprising 50/50 (vol %) dioxolane/dimethoxyethane with 1 M LiTFSI and 0.1 M LiNO3. The membranes consist of layers of fibers with average fiber diameter of 0.1-0.2 mu m. CPEs with f-SiO2 exhibited higher ionic conductivity with a maximum of 1.3 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C obtained with 10 wt % filler compositions. The optimum CPE based on PVdF-HFP with 10 wt % f-SiO2 exhibited enhanced charge-discharge performance in Li-S cells at room-temperature eliminating polysulfide migration, delivering initial specific capacity of 895 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C-rate and a very low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios between 3:1 to 4:1 mL.g(-1). The CPEs also exhibited very stable cycling behavior well over 100 cycles (fade rate similar to 0.056%/cycle), demonstrating their suitability for Li-S battery applications. In addition, the interconnected morphological features of PVdF-HFP result in superior mechanical properties (200-350% higher tensile strength). Higher Li-ion conductivity, higher liquid electrolyte uptake (>250%) with dimensional stability, lower interfacial resistance, and higher electrochemical stability are some of the attractive attributes witnessed with these CPEs. With these improved performance characteristics, the PVdF-HFP system is projected herein as suitable polymer electrolytes system for high-performance Li-S rechargeable batteries.

Sulfur containing gases, H2S and SO2, are dominant air pollutants, while sulfur plays as the clean energy carrier for Li-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, through confining the gaseous comproportionation reaction in water, between H2S and SO2 that normally produces uncontrollable aggregates, we develop a completely clean approach to convert the air pollutants into water-dispersed sulfur nanoparticle (WDS). The WDS is contaminant-free, size-controllable, and more promisingly solution processable, and is thus ideal for achieving solution hybridization with other materials for various applications. As a typical example, an aqueously fabricated WDS/carbon nanotube composite delivers the theoretical capacity of sulfur at 0.5 A g(-1), and a capacity of similar to 750 mAh g(-1) even at a high current density of 5.0 A g(-1). In addition to the normal use of sulfur as cathode, a new-concept WDS/carbon interlayer with a low sulfur content has been designed to inhibit the shuttling of polysulfides, greatly improving the cycling performance of the Li-S battery. The proposed approach gives a good example to turning pollutants into clean energy carriers by green chemistry.

The as-prepared S@CNT-G-TiN composite materials delivered an excellent initial specific capacity of 1291 and 642 mAh/g at 0.1 C and 3 C, respectively. The S@CNT-G-TiN cathode with 7.5 mg/cm(2) sulfur loading exhibited a reversible areal capacity of 7.7 mAh/cm(2) after 100 cycles, which proved that the S@CNT-G-TiN cathode was favored for the construction of high sulfur loading Li-S batteries. The superior electrochemical performance could be attributed to the specific CNT-G-TiN host, which provide a conductive network in the electrode and suppress the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). 5 Ah Li-S pouch cell was also fabricated by using the S@CNT-G-TiN cathode, which exhibited high-energy density of 401 Wh/kg and retained a stable cycling performance with an average capacity fading of 0.2% per cycle after 50 cycles, indicating the potential applications of S@CNT-G-TiN composite materials in high-performance Li-S batteries.

The conductive SACNT matrix not only avoids self-aggregation and ensures dispersive distribution of the sulfur nanocrystals but also offers three-dimensional continuous electron pathway, provides sufficient porosity in the matrix to benefit electrolyte infiltration, confines the sulfur/polysulfides, and accommodates the volume variations of sulfur during cycling. The nanosized sulfur particles shorten lithium ion diffusion path, and the confinement of sulfur particles in the SACNT network guarantees the stability of structure and electrochemical performance of the composite. The nano S-SACNT composite cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1071 mAh g(-1), a peak capacity of 1088 mAh g(-1), and capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles with high Coulombic efficiency (similar to 100%) at 1 C.

Commonly, thermal sulfur infiltration into mesoporous carbon was a representative method for S-C composites; however, these had some problems such as pore blocking or nonuniform deposition of sulfur. Electrochemical sulfur impregnation without chemical or thermal infiltration reduced the preprocess time and enabled efficient polysulfide diffusion into the carbon pores. As the soluble polysulfides are smaller and more mobile than solid-state sulfur, they could be physically or chemically adsorbed into the pores of the carbon additives.

This one-pot preparation method is efficient through its inherent simplicity and low cost. The resultant S/PPy@RGO composite was characterized via EDS, XRD, SEM, TEM and electrochemical measurements. In the S/PPy@RGO ternary composite, reduced graphene oxide played a crucial role of coating a thin layer to trap soluble polysulfide intermediates, provide a continuous electrically conducting network and accommodate volume expansion. Meanwhile polypyrrole with its high absorptivity, joins sulfur and RGO as a binding agent, and tether polysulfides into its porous framework. Therefore, the synthesized S/PPy@RGO composite delivers excellent rate ability and highly cycling stability. This composite can retain a specific discharge capacity of 615.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, even after 100 cycles.

In this contribution, we use Ni-embedded porous graphitic carbon fiber (PGCF@Ni) as the scaffold to construct a novel cathode and anode for LSBs. With the help of elaborate surface engineering, the constructed solid electrolyte interface (SEI)@Li/PGCF@Ni anodes can effectively restrain the growth of lithium dendrites during the cycle, exhibiting an ultralow overpotential of similar to 10 mV for 2000 h at 1 mA cm(-2)/1 mA h cm(-2). The underlying mechanism is further investigated by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. Additionally, the PGCF@Ni/S cathode fabricated by the molten sulfurizing method manifests superior rate performance and stability. Ultimately, the assembled SEI@Li/PGCF@NiIIPGCF@Ni/S full battery exhibits prominent electrochemical property with a high capacity retention of about 77.9% after 600 cycles at 1 C. Such success at the performance improvement in LSBs may open up avenues toward other rational designs of high-quality electrodes in electrochemical energy storage.

The resolving of this issue demands for a robust binder to hold the polysulfide/sulfur particles, but without causing severe disintegration of the electrode. A polar polymeric binder with high mechanical strength was designed and synthesized for use in high-performance sulfur cathodes. The complementary multiple hydrogen bonds formed in the polymeric binder significantly enhanced the adhesive strength of the binder, and buffered the dramatic volume expansion of the sulfur cathode during cycling. The strong physical and chemical interactions between the functional groups (e.g. carboxyl and tertiary amine groups) of the binder and the polysulfides effectively mitigated the shuttling effect in the Li-S batteries. As a consequence, the sulfur cathode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance at a high sulfur loading, yielding an initial discharge capacity of 627.8 mA h g(-1) with sulfur loading up to 9.610 mg cm(-2) at a rate of 0.2C, corresponding to an aerial capacity of 6.03 mA h cm(-1). The present work opens a new avenue for constructing a high-performance Li-S battery using a simple and effective binder.

As the performance of Li-S cells with liquid electrolytes is impaired by the solubility of reaction intermediates, solid-state cell concepts represent an auspicious approach for future electrochemical energy storage. However, the kinetics of Li-S solid-state batteries and high charge/discharge rate still remain major challenges, and in-depth knowledge of the charge carrier transport in solid-state composite sulfur cathodes is still missing. In this work, the charge transport and cyclability of composite cathodes consisting of sulfur, Li6PS5Cl and carbon, with varying volume fractions of ion- and electron-conducting phases is investigated. The limiting thresholds of charge transport are elucidated by comparing the battery performance with effective transport properties of the cathode composite. Although both the effective electronic and ionic conductivities indicate high tortuosity factors, ionic transport is identified as a critical bottleneck. This work underscores the importance of quantitative transport analysis as a tool for cathode optimization.	[Dewald, Georg F.; Ohno, Saneyuki; Hering, Joachim G.

To overcome this problem, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing novel micro-or nano-structured host materials, aiming to trap soluble polysulfide within the network. Herein, we report a new approach to construct a sulfur electrode by impregnating sulfur into the nanopores of covalent-organic frameworks (COFs). Our results clearly demonstrate that by using a 2D COF as a host material, e. g. CTF-1 (CTF: covalent triazine-based framework), the thus-prepared cathode can show a remarkable positive effect on the capacity retention of Li-S batteries. Considering the unique features of COFs, such as highly flexible molecular design and a controllable pore size, this proof-of-principle study provides new opportunities for materials scientists for tailoring cathode materials in Li-S batteries.

Constructing sulfur hosts with high conductivity, suppressed shuttle effect, and rapid kinetics is essential for their practical application in LSBs. Here, we synthetically utilized the merits of ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) and layered Ni(OH)(2) to boost the performance of LSBs. A novel core-shell ZnSe-CNTs/S@Ni(OH)(2) was constructed using the ZnSe-CNTs network as framework to load sulfur and following with Ni(OH)(2) encapsulation. The CNT network decorated with ZnSe QDs not only serves as a conductive framework providing fast electron/ion transfer channels, but also limits polysulfide diffusion physically and chemically. Layered Ni(OH)(2), the wrinkled encapsulation, not only permits fast electron/ion transfer, but also buffers the expansion, confines active materials, and limits the polysulfide dissolution chemically. When used as a cathode, ZnSe-CNTs/S@Ni(OH)(2) presents enhanced electrochemistry performance compared with ZnSe-CNTs/S and CNTs/S. The average specific capacity decreases from 1021.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C to 665.0 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, showing rate capacity much higher than ZnSe-CNTs/S and CNTs/S. After 150 cycles, the capacity at 0.5 C slowly reduces from 926.7 to 789.0 mAh g(-1), showing high retention of 85.1%.

Therefore, it is desirable to develop a new VG growth technique with a novel structure to enable wide applications. Herein, we devise a novel complex permittivity-dependent plasma confinement-assisted VG growth technique, via asymmetric growing a VG layer on one side of N-doped carbon nanofibers for the first time, using a unique lab-built high flux plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition system, as a bifunctional nanofiber membrane to construct Li-S batteries with low negative/positive (N/P) and electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios. The unique nanofiber membrane could simultaneously protect the cathode and anode, enabling an excellent electrochemical performance with low N/P and E/S ratios in Li-S batteries. Such a full cell delivers high gravimetric energy density and volumetric energy density of 340 Wh kg(-1) and 547 Wh L-1, respectively, at low N/P (2:1) and E/S (4:1) ratios. Furthermore, a pouch cell achieves a high areal capacity of 7.1 mAh cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of 6 mg cm(-2). This work put forward a novel pathway for the design of high-energy density Li-S batteries.	[Zhang, Yongshang; Wu, Zhiheng; Silva, S.

In this study, a multifunctional host with vacancy-rich MoSSe vertically grown on reduced graphene oxide aerogels (MoSSe/rGO) is designed as the host material for both sulfur and lithium. The embedding of Se into a MoS2 lattice is introduced to improve the inherent conductivity and generate abundant anion vacancies to endow the 3D conductive graphene based aerogels with specific sulfiphilicity-lithiophilicity. As a result, the assembled Li-S batteries based on MoSSe/rGO exhibit greatly improved capacity and cycling stability and can be operated under a lean electrolyte (4.8 mu L mg(-1)) and a high sulfur loading (6.5 mg cm(-2)), achieving a high energy density. This study presents a unique method to unlock the catalysis capability and improve the inherent lithiophilicity by heteroatom doping and defect chemistry for kinetics-enhanced and dendrite-free Li-S batteries.

In this work we describe how a free-standing sulfur/reduced graphene oxide with embedded carbon nanotubes electrode has been synthesized by a novel, facile and eco-friendly method taking advantage of the solubility difference of polar and nonpolar materials. First, the nonpolar elemental sulfur is dissolved in a weak polar solvent (ethanol) by intensive ultrasonication. During a subsequent heavy polar solvent (deionized water) drop-wise procedure, nano-sized sulfur particles are precipitated from the ethanol and deposited on the dispersed carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide. Noticeably, since ascorbic acid is taken as the reducing agent for graphene oxide at 75 degrees C, the process produces no toxic byproducts. Besides, the 'as-designed' sulfur/reduced graphene oxide with embedded carbon nanotubes graphene oxide displays a unique structure with both the sulfur and carbon nanotubes embedded in the basal plane of reduced graphene oxide. The manufactured electrode is found to exhibit excellent rate capability and cyclability, with the maximum capacity of 1025 mA h g(-1) observed in the third cycle and a stable capacity of 704 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles.

However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPs) and sluggish Li-S chemistry has severely limited their wide implication. Herein, we designed an ultrathin and vacancy-rich ZnCo-layered double hydroxide (ZnCo-LDH) anchored on CNT substrate (noted as CNT-LDH/Ar). Theoretical calculations and analysis at the experimental level are used to comprehensively explain the mechanism by which the oxygen vacancies (Vo) regulate the catalytic activity and adsorption capacity mechanism. The introduction of CNT not only improves a three-dimensional conductive network, but also exposes more active sites for polysulfide adsorption and conversion. More importantly, our design of Vo endows the material with excellent half-metallicity properties, adsorption capacity and low redox barrier. Benefiting from these properties, the S/CNT-LDH/Ar cathode exhibited excellent rate capability with 524.3 mAh g(-1) at 5 C, and maintained an excellent cyclability over 500 cycles at 1.0 C with a capacity fading of only 0.042% per cycle. Most importantly, decent cyclability can be acquired with a remarkably raised sulfur loading up to 5.5 mg cm (2) with the lean electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 6 mL g(-1).

Doping heteroatoms was confirmed to enhance the affinity of polysulfide and the carbon host, release the shuttle effect, and improve the battery performance. To enhance the Lewis acidity and reinforce the interaction between polysulfide and the carbon skeleton, a novel covalent triazine framework (CTFO) was designed and fabricated by copolymerizing 2,4,6-triphenoxy-s-triazine and 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine through Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Polymerization led to triazine substitution on the para-position of the phenoxy groups of 2,4,6-triphenoxy-triazine and produced two-dimensional three-connected honeycomb nanosheets. These nanosheets were confirmed to exhibit packing in the AB style through the intralayer pi-pi interaction to form a three-dimensional layered network with micropores of 0.5 nm. The practical and simulated results manifested the enhanced polysulfide capture capability due to the abundant N and O heteroatoms in CTFO. The unique porous polar network endowed CTFO with improved Li-S battery performance with high Coulombic efficiency, rate capability, and cycling stability. The S@CTFO cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 791 mAh g(-1) at 1C and retained a residual capacity of 512 mAh g(-1) after 300 charge-discharge cycles with an attenuation rate of 0.117%. The present results confirmed that multiple heteroatom doping enhances the interaction between the porous polar CTF skeleton and polysulfide intermediates to improve the Li-S battery performance.

However, it should be admitted that conventional preparation routes for porous carbon are complicated and generally involve high-temperature processing, which increases the cost and production difficulty. In this work, a facile hydrothermal tactic was put forward to fabricate oxidized porous carbon materials (OPCBs) for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The specific surface area of OPCBs and the size of the formed pores could be flexibly adjusted by regulating hydrothermal conditions, simultaneously retaining the intact structure of the particles, even without seriously affecting the conductivity of carbon/sulfur composites in some OPCBs. Polar interfaces introduced by hydrothermal processing could immobilize long-chain lithium polysulfide via the chemical interaction, whereas the appearance of micro-mesoporous structure played a critical role in physical restrictions of sulfur species and offered a more rapid lithium-ion transmission pathway during cycling. As a result, the optimized OPAB-140-1.5@S delivered a superior comprehensive cycle performance, which maintained quite an impressive reversible capacity of 602 mA h g(-1), even after 400 cycles with a low decay rate of 0.08% per cycle. In addition, the tailor-made pore structures with different characteristics prepared by the straightforward technique provide some enlightenment on the potential orientation to multi-field applications.

Herein, a freestanding multifunctional interlayer, prepared by layer-by-layer assembling of the single-atom cobalt-anchored nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (NC@SA-Co) and dual network of carbon nanotube-cellulose nanofiber (CNT-CNF) hybrid, is proposed to effectively enhance the polysulfide immobilization and sulfur redox kinetics. The conductive CNT network acts as the physical barrier to confine the polysulfide diffusion and to facilitate the reuse of polysulfides. The oxygen-group-terminated CNF network allows the hopping of Li+ ion and suppresses the polysulfide crossover due to the strong electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the 2D NC@SA-Co with numerous well-defined single sites of Co-N-4 can effectively serve as an electrocatalyst to boost the reversible reaction of polysulfides. As a result, the assembled Li-S batteries with the multifunctional interlayer deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 1160 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and an ultralow capacity decay of 0.058% per cycle over 700 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading of 7.2 mg cm(-2), a high areal capacity of 8.3 mAh cm(-2) can be achieved.

However, the poor conductivity of sulfur species and the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides (PSs) severely limit the practical application of Li-S battery. Here, a large-scaled covalent triazine framework/multiwall carbon nanotube (CTF/MWCNT) hybrid used as a multi-functional separator modifier combining strong PSs-anchor ability of CTF with high electrical conductivity of MWCNT was proposed. The ordered porous structure and large specific surface area of CTF make it good physical trap ability for PSs shuttle, and the abundant pyridinic nitrogen groups of CTF render it effectively adsorb PSs by chemical sorption, while the high electrical conductivity of MWCNT can facilitate electron transfer. As it turns out that the multi-functional separator applied in Li-S battery shows significant enhancements in the utilization of sulfur, specific capacity, Columbic efficiency, rate capability (982 mAh g(-1) at 2 C) and cycling stability (0.045% specific capacity loss per cycle at 1 C along 1000 cycles) as well as suppression of self-discharge and Li dendrite growth. Furthermore, it is practicable to incorporate the slurry cast multi-functional layer onto the commercial separator, which provides ideas for constructing advanced multi-functional separators for commercially viable Li-S battery.

For this composite, the 3D porous graphene aerogel provides an interconnected conductive framework to improve the electron conductivity and the utilization of sulfur. The encapsulation of polypyrrole on the sulfur can restrict the polysulfide diffusion and enhance the cycling stability of the lithium-sulfur battery. The micro-structure characterization confirms the homogeneous dispersion of sulfur and polypyrrole on the graphene aerogel backbone. The graphene aerogel/sulfur/polypyrrole composite cathode with a sulfur content of 73 wt% presents an initial discharge capacity of 1288 mA h g(-1) and maintains 1017 mA h g(-1) after 100 charge-discharge cycles at 0.5C, which is much higher than that of the composite lacking polypyrrole.

However, the shuttle effect hinders their practical application. Here, novel nitrogen-doped micro-/mesoporous carbon (N-MIMEC), derived from crab shells, was fabricated via a sustainable and cost-effective route. A modified separator coated with an N-MIMEC layer for Li-S batteries exhibits many advantages: (1) the micro-/mesopores provide enough surface area for sulfide adsorption, and accommodate the volume change; (2) the nitrogen in N-MIMEC enhances polysulfide adsorption and increases the electronic conductivity of the carbon framework; and (3) the conductive layer acts as an upper current collector, increasing the electrical conductivity. An enhanced Li-S battery with an N-MIMEC-coated separator was constructed, with an initial capacity of 1301 mA h g(-1) and a high reversible capacity of 971.3 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C. Also, upon further increasing the sulfur loading from 63 wt% to 77 wt%, the corresponding Li-S batteries exhibit a high reversible capacity of 578 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C, with a decay rate of about 0.029% per cycle. Considering the green and sustainable source material, simple preparation and good electrochemical performance, the N-MIMEC-coated separator is promising for Li-S battery applications.

However, the LSBs have several limitations including the low electronic conductivity of sulfur (5 x10(-30) S cm(-1)), associated lithium polysulfides (PSs), and their migration from the cathode to the anode. In this study, a separator coated with a Ketjen black (KB)/Nafion composite was used in an LSB with a sulfur loading up to 7.88 mg cm(-2) to mitigate the PS migration. A minimum specific capacity (C-s) loss of 0.06% was obtained at 0.2 C-rate at a high sulfur loading of 4.39 mg cm(-2). Furthermore, an initial areal capacity up to 6.70 mA h cm(-2) was obtained at a sulfur loading of 7.88 mg cm(-2). The low C-s loss and high areal capacity associated with the high sulfur loading are attributed to the large surface area of the KB and sulfonate group (SO3-) of Nafion, respectively, which could physically and chemically trap the PSs.

The electrochemical properties of the S/ZnO@NCNT composite cathode were evaluated in Li/S batteries. It delivered an initial capacity of 1032 mAh.g(-1) at a charge/discharge rate of 0.2C and maintained a reversible capacity of 665 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles. The coulombic efficiency of the cathode remains unchanged above 99%, showing stable cycling performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed the formation of S-Zn and S-O bonds in the composite. This indicates that an enhanced cycling and rate capability of the S/ZnO@NCNT composite could be ascribed to advantages of the ZnO@NCNT matrix. In the composite, the active ZnO-rich surfaces offer a high sulfur-bonding capability and the NCNT core acts as a conductive framework providing pathways for ion and electron transport. The as-prepared S/ZnO@NCNT composite is a promising cathode material for Li/S batteries.

The physical and electrochemical behavior of the NCFs were investigated and it was found that their electrochemical performances depended on the pyrolysis temperature. Of the samples carbonized at 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C, those carbonized at 900 degrees C performed best, and delivered a reversible capacity of 875 mAh.g(-1) at a high sulfur loading of 4.19 mg.cm(2) and retained at 707 mAh.g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.2 C. The coulombic efficiency of the NCF-900@Li2S6 electrode was almost 98.55% over the entire cycle life. In addition, the capacity retention of the electrode reached 81.53% even at a high current density of 1 C for over 150 cycles. It was found that the NCFs carbonized at 900 degrees C had the highest electrical conductivity, which might be the dominant factor that determined its performance for use as a positive current collector.

The results demonstrated the presence of 1 M LiTFSI/PYR13TESI ionic liquid; the interface stability at the electrode/solid electrolyte (i.e., Li/LGPS) was improved remarkably by forming an in situ solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. As a result, an effectively reduced interfacial resistance from 2021 to 142 Omega cm(2) and stable Li stripping/plating performance (over 1200 h at 0.038 mA cm(-2) and 1000 h at 0.1 mA cm(-2)) were achieved in the Li/LGPS/Li symmetric cells. On this basis, the Li-S solid-state batteries were further architectured with one of the S@C composite [where C is the ketjen black carbon (KBC) or PBX 51-type activated carbon (PBX51C) or multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MCNTs)] cathode and the LGPS solid electrolyte. The batteries with S@KBC electrodes delivered an excellent discharge/charge performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 1017 mA h g(-1) and better stability than those of the batteries with the S@PBX51C and S@MCNTs electrodes. High surface area, unique beneficial pore structure, and better particle dispersion of sulfur in the S@KBC composite facilitate high sulfur utilization and also increase the intimate contact between the electrode and LGPS solid electrolyte during the discharge/charge process.

Herein, we demonstrate a new strategy for developing a hierarchical phosphorus-doped graphene/carbon nanofiber/sulfur aerogel (PGCNF/S) with "network" morphologies, in which sulfur spheres are wrapped with graphene sheets and carbon nanofibers (PGCNFs) with "net" structures and this carbon matrix has greatly improved the electrochemical performances of sulfur spheres. PGCNF nets ensure a uniform loading of sulfur spheres that leads to a high sulfur mass loading of 85 wt%. Also, the good porous structures achieved with this PGCNF/S cathode can provide sufficient space for volume expansion of active sulfur spheres. Due to its structural advantages, this binder-free PGCNF/S cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 1360 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, and a high areal capacity of 21.5 mA h cm(-2) based on a high sulfur mass loading of 15.8 mg cm(-2). Furthermore, a long term cycling stability of 600 cycles has been achieved by this PGCNF/S cathode with an average coulombic efficiency of similar to 99.8%. This work highlights a broadly adaptable strategy of "network" structures for developing scalable and high-energy density electrode materials for energy storage devices.

Formation of Multilayer Graphene Domains with Strong Sulfur-Carbon Interaction and Enhanced Sulfur Reduction Zones for Lithium-Sulfur Battery Cathodes	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						energy conversion; molecular dynamics; ensembles; multi-layered graphene; sulfur-carbon interactions	REACTIVE FORCE-FIELD; ELECTRONEGATIVITY EQUALIZATION METHOD; HIGH-CAPACITY; AB-INITIO; COMPOSITE; ELECTROLYTE; SIMULATIONS; MECHANISM; ANODE	A newly designed sulfur/graphene computational model emulates the electrochemical behavior of a Li-S battery cathode, promoting the S-C interaction through the edges of graphene sheets. A random mixture of eight-membered sulfur rings mixed with small graphene sheets is simulated at 64wt%sulfur loading. Structural stabilization and sulfur reduction calculations are performed with classical reactive molecular dynamics. This methodology allowed the collective behavior of the sulfur and graphene structures to be accounted for. The sulfur encapsulation induces ring opening and the sulfur phase evolves into a distribution of small chain-like structures interacting with C through the graphene edges. This new arrangement of the sulfur phase not only leads to a less pronounced volume expansion during sulfur reduction but also to a different discharge voltage profile, in qualitative agreement with earlier reports on sulfur encapsulation in microporous carbon structures. The Li2S phase grows around ensembles of parallel graphene nanosheets during sulfur reduction. No diffusion of sulfur or lithium between graphene nanosheets is observed, and extended Li2S domains bridging the space between carbon ensembles are suppressed. The results emphasize the importance of morphology on the electrochemical performance of the composite material. The sulfur/graphene model outlined here provides new understanding of the graphene effects on the sulfur reduction behavior and the role that van der Waals interactions may play in promoting formation of multilayer graphene ensembles and small Li2S domains during sulfur reduction.

The irradiation cross-linking mechanism was first determined by Fourier transform infrared spectra, elemental analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. At the same time, according to the relationship between the different degree of crosslinking produced by irradiation and the change of sulfur load after PAN vulcanization, the sulfur storage mechanism of vulcanized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) for lithium-sulfur battery cathode material was discussed. Using Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra and other analytical methods, from the perspective of cross-linking, the reaction position of S in SPAN was demonstrated , and the tertiary carbon on the PAN main chain was the active site for chemical bonding with S. It provides a new basis for exploring the SPAN structure. The increase in the degree of cross-linking promotes the electrochemical stability of the SPAN cathode material formed after vulcanization, and the capacity retention rate can he increased to 98%.
