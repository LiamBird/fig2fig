However, applications of Li-S battery have been hindered by limited specific capacity due to the poor conductivity and low content of sulfur, as well as fast capacity fading caused by polysulfide shuttling problems. Here, silver iodide is introduced as a host material for fabricating sulfur cathodes for Li-S batteries. Silver metal and lithium iodide, as the discharge products of silver iodide, can improve the redox environment, increase the ionic and electronic conductivity, and inhibit the shuttle of polysulfides during the charge and discharge processes. With a high sulfur content of 90.4%, the S/AgI composite delivers enhanced cycle performance with a decay rate of 0.092% per cycle within 500 cycles at 0.5 C, thanks to the synergistic effect of silver and lithium iodide. This opens the door to the rational design of halogen-containing transition-metal compounds as a class of cathode materials for Li-S battery.

The cells employing the PANiNF/MWCNT-functionalized separators facilitate high reversible capacities of 709, 641, and 612 mA h g(-1) at, respectively, C/5, C/2, and 1C rates after 100 cycles. High charge-storage capacity retention was also found in the cell with the PANiNF/MWCNT-functionalized separator after a resting time of 12 h. Such dynamic and static electrochemical stability could be ascribed to the synergistic physical adsorption and chemical immobilization of the polysulfides by the ultra-lightweight PANiNF/MWCNT coating (only 0.01 mg cm(-2)). This demonstrates that the design of hybrid polymer/carbon-coated-separators has the potential to become a viable approach for successfully developing practical Li-S batteries.

However, microporous carbon/ sulfur composites suffer from lower sulfur contents through the traditional sulfur loading methods. In this paper, we present an effective and facile approach to prepare a double-hollow-sphere structured microporous carbon coated sulfur composite by in situ oxidizing the microporous carbon coated metal sulfide precursor. The composite efficiently traps sulfur inside the microporous-walled hollow carbon sphere. With the appropriate sulfur content ranging from 55 wt% to 75 wt%, the composites demonstrate promising cycling performance. The composites deliver a capacity retention of 96.11% at 0.2C after 100 cycles, and a relatively low decay rate of 0.05% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1C.

Herein, a facile approach is utilized to prepare free-standing 3D cathode substrates comprising nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) scaffold and metal-organic framework derived interconnected chain-like hollow N-C nanocages, forming a highly porous N-C nanofiber (HP-N-CNF) framework. The N-C skeleton provides highly conductive pathways for fast lithium ion/electron diffusion. The hollow interconnected N-C nanocages not only offer enough space to absorb a high volume of active material but also effectively channelize severe volume stress during the electrochemical performance. The Li-S cell utilizing HP-N-CNF as cathode host displays exceptional battery parameters with high effective sulfur content (83.2 wt%), ultrahigh sulfur loading (14.3 mg cm(-2)), and low E/S ratio (6.8 mu L mg(-1)). The Li-S cell exhibits a maximum areal capacity of 12.2 mAh cm(-2) which stabilizes at approximate to 5.5 mAh cm(-2) after the 130th cycle at 0.05 C-rate and is well above the theoretical threshold. Therefore, the proposed unique nanostructure synthesis approach would open new frontiers for developing more realistic and sustainable host materials with feasible battery parameters for various energy storage applications.

J	Beltran, SP; Balbuena, PB				Beltran, Saul Perez; Balbuena, Perla B.			First-principles explorations of the electrochemical lithiation dynamics of a multilayer graphene nanosheet-based sulfur-carbon composite	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							LITHIUM STORAGE; BATTERIES; CATHODE; NANOCOMPOSITES; STABILITY; MECHANISM	Graphitized-polymer-based sulfur cathodes have emerged as alternative cathode materials that are able to overcome many of the technical challenges that currently hinder lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries from their use in long-term high-energy applications. However, even though graphitized-polymer-based sulfur cathodes can be synthesized through a facile thermal procedure, and there is evidence of sulfur-carbon chemical bonding, little is known about the electrochemical lithiation processes in these structures. So far, no mechanistic study has followed the dynamics of the discharging process, and no theoretical study has addressed why certain Li-S batteries based on graphitized-polymer-based sulfur cathodes have shown an initial discharge capacity higher than the theoretical discharge capacity of sulfur (1672 mA h g(-1)). Here we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations as a tool to follow the electrochemical lithiation processes in a multilayer graphene nanosheet-based sulfur-carbon composite model embedded in a liquid 1,3-dioxolane solvent phase. Our model reproduces the main structural motifs associated with graphitized-polymer-based sulfur cathodes: chemical sulfur-carbon bonding and - stacking for the carbon backbone. Our results indicate that sulfur-carbon bonding prevents sulfur from retaining its stable cyclic structure before lithiation yielding a distribution of linear sulfur chains tightly bonded to the carbon backbone. During lithiation, we observe a competing effect for the incoming electrons between the sulfur atoms and the carbon backbone. This effect induces the partial reduction of the carbon backbone leading to accumulation of additional lithium around it, favoring the lithiation process beyond a 2:1 Li:S molar ratio. As a consequence, it also limits the formation of extended Li2S-like structures as the final reduction products. Finally, comparison of the calculated voltage discharge profile of our model shows close agreement with reported experimental voltage profiles based on sulfur/polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathodes, with the proposed mechanisms providing a plausible structural explanation for the additional discharge capacity of SPAN-based cathodes compared to the theoretical discharge capacity of sulfur.

Synthetic TMDs produced by chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) methods`tend to grow parallel to the growth substrate. Here, we show that with the right precursors and appropriate tuning of the CVD growth conditions, ReS2 nanosheets can be made to orient perpendicular to the growth substrate. This accomplishes two important objectives; first, it drastically increases the wetted or exposed surface area of the ReS2 sheets, and second, it exposes the sharp edges and corners of the ReS2 sheets. We show that these structural features of the vertically grown ReS2 sheets can be exploited to significantly improve their performance as polysulfide immobilizers and electro-chemical catalysts in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries and in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). After 300 cycles, the specific capacity of the Li-S battery with vertical ReS2 catalyst is retained above 750 mA h g(-1), with only similar to 0.063% capacity decay per cycle, much better than the baseline battery (without ReS2), which shows similar to 0.184% capacity decay per cycle under the same test conditions. As a HER catalyst, the vertical ReS2 provides very small onset overpotential (<100 mV) and an exceptional exchange-current density (similar to 67.6 mu A/cm(2)), which is vastly superior to the baseline electrode without ReS2.

However, the conventional cathode configuration borrowed from lithium-ion batteries may not allow the pure sulfur cathode to put its unique materials chemistry to good use. The solid((sulfur))-liquid((polysulfides))-solid((sulfides)) phase transitions generate polysulfide intermediates that are soluble in the commonly used organic solvents in Li-S cells. The resulting severe polysulfide diffusion and the irreversible active-material loss have been hampering the development of Li-S batteries for years. The present study presents a robust, ultra-tough, flexible cathode with the active-material fillings encapsulated between two buckypapers (B), designated as buckypaper/sulfur/buckypaper (B/S/B) cathodes, that suppresses the irreversible polysulfide diffusion to the anode and offers excellent electrochemical reversibility with a low capacity fade rate of 0.06% per cycle after 400 cycles. Engineering enhancements demonstrate that the B/S/B cathodes represent a facile approach for the development of high-performance sulfur electrodes with a high areal capacity of 5.1 mA h cm(-2), which increases further to approach 7 mA h cm(-2) on coupling with carbon-coated separators.

The influence of the structure of raw biomass on microstructure, sulfur-loading amount, and electrochemical performance was investigated in detail. The results demonstrated that the catkin-derived porous carbon (CPC) inherited the 1D-structured morphology and exhibited the highest specific surface area (2033.09 m(2)/g), the largest sulfur loading (53.72%), and the highest initial discharge specific capacity (1369.52 mA h g(-1)) under 0.1 C. Comparatively speaking, the wrinkled cloth-like sakura petal-derived porous carbon showed a better capacity (1218.14 mA h g(-1)) but poor cycling performance.

However, precisely designed core shell structures of conductive elements can offer a viable solution. Herein, a facile and scalable approach is presented to synthesize polyaniline (PANi) wrapped ketjenblack carbon-sulfur composites as cathode active materials of the lithium-sulfur battery. PANi synthesized in formic acid displays higher electrical conductivity than that in hydrochloric acid as well as greater doping degree. Formic acid PANi doping avoids any chloride ions that promote pitting corrosion of Al current collectors enabling direct casting of active material slurries. The as-prepared cathode material delivers discharge capacities of 1435 mA h g(-1), 850 mA h g(-1) and 485 mA h g(-1) at C/20, C/5 and 1C with nominal capacity fading for 500 cycles of galvanostatic charge-discharge.

The chemical bonds exist between PPy and rGO through the formation of graphitic N and pyridine oxide N, and the C-S, S-C = S and S-O chemical bonds form between rGO/PPy and S in the structure of the rGO/PPy/S material. The loading content of sulphur is 69.43 wt.% for the rGO/PPy/S sample. The rGO/PPy/S material exhibits a high performance when used as the cathode of Li-S battery. The initial and last discharge capacity arrived at 991.5 and 626.7 mAh g (1) at 1C with 400 cycles which is corresponding to the capacity retention ratio of 63.2%, indicating its very high cyclic stability. The discharge capacity of 537.4 mAh g (1) could be obtained at 5C and it maintained at 442.1 mAh g (1) after 400 cycles with the Coulombic efficiency of more than 90%, showing its excellent rate stability.

Nonetheless, the shuttling of soluble long-chain polysulfides severely deteriorates the cyclic performances of the batteries. Herein, an encapsulated sulfur electrode to tackle the shuttle effect is designed. This high-performance electrode is fabricated by encapsulating the active sulfur inside a sealing configuration composed of lithiated Nafion (Li-Nafion), carbon black (BP2000), and a binder of polytetrafluoroethylene. The dense surface of the encapsulated configuration can physically obstruct the mobility of soluble polysulfides. Meanwhile, the sulfonic acid groups fixed on the Li-Nafion backbone provide a robust electrostatic repulsion to inhibit the negatively charged polysulfides from migrating into the electrolyte. Therefore, the encapsulated sulfur electrode delivers 522.6 mAh g(-1) at the 600th cycle with a retention of 80.36%, exhibiting a more competitive cyclic stability than the pristine sulfur electrode.

Transmission electronic microscopy revealed the formation of a highly developed network structure consisting of PAN and sulfur homogeneous mixing at nanosized level, providing the "buffering" space to accommodate the volume change of sulfur upon cycling and retaining the structural integrity preventing the material agglomeration and degradation. Benefiting from this unique structure, the S/pPAN composite cathode demonstrated enhanced reversibility, resulting in a discharge capacity of 1177 mAh g(-1) at the second cycle and retained about 100% of this value over 100 cycles at 0.5C. Furthermore, the S/(p)PAN composite cathode delivered a discharge capacity of 981 mAh g(-1) at the 100th cycle at 1C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, the notorious "shuttle effect" phenomenon of polysulfides has greatly hindered its commercial applications. Herein, a coating composite cathode is fabricated via a facile phase separation approach, in which commercially available gel PVDF-HFP (poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)) electrolyte could be formed a thin and dense coating on sulfur cathode. Moreover, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are employed as conducting skeleton to provide effective electron transfer pathway, which could ensure a long-term cycling life. By elaborately adjusting the concentration and thickness of gel electrolyte, coating composite cathodes with various surface morphologies are obtained. The optimized coating composite cathode with PVDF-HFP gel layer (5 wt%) exhibits a small capacity decay (0.179% per cycle) after 105 cycles at 0.5C, and an outstanding rate performance (408 mAh g(-1) at 2C), which holds a great potential for large-scale applications.

Binding mechanism of sulfur and dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile in sulfur/polymer composite cathode	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Polyacrylonitrile; Lithium-sulfur battery; Sulfur content; Cathode; Composite	ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; CARBON NANOTUBES; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; BATTERIES; CAPACITY; SOLVENT; CELL	A composite consisting of sulfur/dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile is one of the most promising cathode materials for use in rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries. However, the reported sulfur contents have been low, less than 50 wt%, which compromise the intrinsic high specific capacity and energy of elemental sulfur and hence decrease significantly the specific energy of the composite. To identify the potential to further increase the sulfur content, we elucidate the binding mechanism of sulfur and polyacrylonitrile in their composite. The heat treatment experiments at varying timespans with excess sulfur showed a constancy of sulfur content after a critical length of timespan, indicating the saturation of sulfur in the structure of dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile. Based on molecular structure and size consideration, it is proposed that the binding involves the formation of an 8 membered ring of sulfur embedded between 4 heterocyclic rings of dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile. From this model and experimental results, we show that there exists an upper limit of sulfur content in the sulfur/dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile composite at 56 wt%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we pioneeringly prepared a 3D cotton-pad-like hierarchically porous carbon (CPHPC) structure stacked by hexagonal highly graphitized carbon nanosheets based on In-MOFs synthesized at room temperature, which was demonstrated to be the effective sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The sulfur@CPHPC cathodes exhibit excellent rate performance with reversible capacities of 1349 and 691 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 and 20 C, respectively, and admirable cycling performance with quite low decay rates of 0.033% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 0.5 C and 0.014% per cycle for 3800 cycles at 10 C. The admirable electrochemical performances are ascribed to the superior conductivity resulting from the 3D highly graphitized carbon conductive network, the effective confinements of polysulfides arising from sufficient contact between the carbon host and sulfur, and the high stability of rigid structures stacked by porous nanosheets. This easily achieved unique carbon structure and its derivatives in the form of carbon have a critical role to play in the performances of not only Li-S batteries but also lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, catalysis, and chemical absorption.

Disordered mesoporous carbons replicated by silica nanoparticles were partially filled with sulfur via a melt-diffusion method. Sulfur-impregnated disordered mesoporous carbon (DMC-S) composites were used as an interlayer between a cathode and anode to provide additional active materials for a Li-S cell. The Li-S cell with the DMC-S interlayer exhibited an approximately two-fold increase in areal capacity compared with the control cell without an interlayer. DMC-S composites offer the unique advantage of acting as a porous framework to accommodate active materials and suppress polysulfide diffusion. We propose that this new approach provides a viable path for the development of Li-S batteries with a high-energy density and excellent cycling stability.

Here, we report a CMP embedded with a single-atom Co catalyst (Co-CMP) as an electrocatalytic sulfur host for promoting the cathode reactions of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The Co-CMP was synthesized by copolymerizing a dibromo salcyen Co complex with tris(ethynylthiophene)triazine using standard Sonogashira coupling methodology. In addition to featuring a single-atom catalyst (SAC), the Co-CMP possesses a high quantity of pyridinic nitrogen atoms and relatively large pore sizes that collectively facilitate sulfur cathode chemistry. The performance displayed by Li-S cells fabricated with the Co-CMP was outstanding when compared with cells that were devoid of a SAC, particularly in terms of specific capacity (1404 vs. 1338 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C), rate capability (766 vs. 613 mA h g(-1) at 2 C), and cycling stability (549 vs. 314 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C). Density functional theory calculations in conjunction with X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy measurements revealed that the single-atom Co catalyst lowers the cathode reaction energies by forming bonding interactions with the polysulfide anions as well as the Li cations that are present in sulfur cathodes. Since the methodology is modular and obviates the extreme steps required by other approaches, it can be employed to synthesize new classes of CMPs containing SACs with predictable structures and functions for use in a broad range of contemporary catalytic applications.

The composition analysis and structure characteristics of samples are conducted by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The electrochemical performances of samples are examined by cyclic voltammetric (CV), charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The effects of the carbonization temperatures on the physicochemical and electrochemical performances of the resultant mesoporous carbon polyhedron are carefully studied. The results show that the activated mesoporous carbon polyhedron (AMCP-950), which is prepared by the MOF-5 (Zn4O(BDC)(3)) carbonized at the optimized temperature (950 degrees C) and then KOH activation, has uniform sponge-like morphology, abundant mesoporous structure and huge large specific surface areas of 2211.1 m(2)/g. Besides, AMCP-950/S composite shows the high sulfur content of 79.0 wt%, the excellent electrochemical performance with the high initial capacity of 1274.0 mAh/g (based on the weight of C/S active substance) and over 81.7% capacity retention after 50 cycles at a discharge rate of 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mAh/g) as well as excellent coulombic efficiency.

We present here a new cathode active material (a covalently grafted polysulfur-graphene nanocomposite (polySGN)) for ultrahigh loading Li-polyS batteries. The new cathode active material polySGN offers several advantages: (i) the well-dispersed graphene sheets offer highly electrically conductive pathways for electrons to travel within the polySGN matrix; (ii) the intermediate organosulfide moieties alleviate irreversible sulfide deposition on electrodes; and (iii) the in situ formed coating layer on the cathode-side surface of the polymeric separator further reduces polysulfide migration. The Li-polyS batteries employing polySGN as the cathode active material accomplish the highest sulfur loading (up to 10.5 mg cm(-2)) and the highest areal capacity (,(-)similar to 12 mA h cm(-2)) reported thus far in the literature.

Using them to construct large-scale 3D frameworks further extends their utility in electrochemical applications because it exposes more interfaces and active sites. In this study, electrostatic interactions are used to wrap polyhedra particles of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets to prepare the composite structure. Pyrolyzing this structure generates a 3D porous carbon framework (PCF) composed of polyhedral-shaped hollow carbon coated with reduced GO. The size of the polyhedral macropores can be adjusted from nanometer scale to micrometer scale. The PCFs generate a continuous network of heterostructured carbon with a large surface area and large pore volumes that are particularly useful as porous electrodes in lithium-sulfur batteries. The PCF/S composite electrode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 1151 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and a low capacity decay of 0.035% per cycle after 650 cycles.

Herein, a multifunctional heterostructure material (MoS3-Ti3C2Tx) comprising a functionalized MXene (Ti3C2Tx) and amorphous MoS3 is prepared by a scalable electrostatic self-assembly method. Remarkably, as lithium-ion battery anodes, the resultant MoS3-Ti3C2Tx not only exhibits increased electrochemical activity, accelerated lithium-ion diffusion and fast charge transfer kinetics but also shows high specific capacity, excellent rate performance and long-term cycling stability. By virtue of these merits, MoS3-Ti3C2Tx offers an excellent reversible capacity of 1043 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) and exhibited a capacity of 568 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1) after 1000 cycles. When acting as the cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries, the amorphous MoS3 anchored on MXene demonstrates high capture and catalytic activity towards polysulfide conversion. Accordingly, the optimized electrode exhibits a capacity of 836 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles and a satisfactory rate performance of 463 mAh g(-1) at 2C after 400 cycles. Moreover, the associated conversion mechanism is studied by ex situ XPS. These results demonstrate that heterostructure composites constructed by an amorphous sulfide and surface functionalized MXene are feasible electrode materials for both lithium-sulfur batteries and lithium-ion batteries.

For the as-prepared sulfur-rich polymeric materials (C-S copolymer), diynes or polydiynes are chemically cross-linked with a large amount of polymeric sulfur to form a cage-like semi-interpenetrating network (semi-IPN) structure. Due to the strong chemical interaction of sulfur with the carbon framework and the unique cage-like structure in C-S copolymers, the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides out of the cathode is effectively suppressed through chemical and physical means. As a result, the sulfur-rich C-S polymeric materials with semi-IPN structure exhibit excellent cycling stability and high coulombic efficiency. The initial discharge capacity is 1143 mA h g(-1) at a 0.1 C rate. The capacity still remains at 70% even after about 500 cycles at a high current density of 1 C. In addition, a high coulombic efficiency of over 99% is obtained during the entire range of cycling.

Benefiting from a conductive C outer Layer, the S@MnO2@C hybrid nanosphere provided highly efficient pathways for fast electron/ion transfer and sufficient free space for the expansion of the encapsulated sulfur nanoparticles. Moreover, the dual-shell composed of a MnO2 inner Layer and a C outer Layer coating on S not only improved the efficacious encapsulation of sulfur, but also significantly suppressed the dissolution of polysulfides during cycling. As a result, the S@MnO2@C electrode shows high capacity, high coulombic efficiency and excellent cycling stability. The S@MnO2@C cathode delivered a discharge capacity of 593 mA h g(-1) in the fourth cycle and was able to maintain 573 mA h g(-1) after 100 charge-discharge cycles at 1.0C, corresponding to a capacity retention of 96.6%.

The main challenge in developing long-life Li-S batteries is to simultaneously suppress the shuttle effect and high areal mass loading of sulfur required for practical applications. To solve this problem, we have designed a novel nickel phosphide nanoporous composite derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sulfur host materials. Homogeneous distribution of Ni2P nanoparticles significantly avoids soluble polysulfides migrating out of the framework through strong chemical interactions, and the conductive 3D skeleton offers an accelerating electron transport. As a result, S@Ni2P/NC has exhibited an enhanced performance of 1357 mAh g(-1) initially at 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) and remaining at 946 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles. Even at an areal mass loading of sulfur as high as 4.6 mg cm(-2), the electrode still showed an excellent specific capacity of 918 m Ah g(-1).

While total pore volume in sulfur cathodes affects AE/S and performance, it is shown here that pore morphology, size, connectivity, and fill factor all matter. Compared to conventional thermally dried sulfur cathodes that usually render "open lakes" and closed pores, a freeze-dried and compressed (FDS-C) sulfur cathode is developed with a canal-capillary pore structure, which exhibits high mean performance and greatly reduces cell-to-cell variation, even at high sulfur loading (14.2 mg cm(-2)) and ultralean electrolyte condition (AE/S = 1.2 mu L mg(-1)). Interestingly, as AE/S is swept from 2 to 1.2 mu L mg(-1), the electrode pores go from fully flooded to semi-flooded, and the coin cell still maintains function until (AE/S)(min) approximate to 1.2 mu L mg(-1) is reached. When scaled up to Ah-level pouch cells, the full-cell energy density can reach 481 Wh kg(-1) as its E/S approximate to AE/S ratio can be reduced to 1.2 mu L mg(-1), proving high-performance pouch cells can actually be working in the ultralean, semi-flooded regime.

It is therefore desirable to explore multifunctional host candidate coupled with advanced fabrication technique to concurrently modulate both electrodes. Herein, we propose a versatile 3D printed (3DP) framework comprising nitrogen-doped porous Ti3C2 MXene (N-pTi(3)C(2)T(x)) that is competent in regulating dual electrodes of Li-S batteries. Such a 3DP scaffold possesses hierarchical porosity, high conductivity, as well as ample nitrogen sites to synergize lithiophilic-sulfiphilic feature. Serving as a dendrite inhibitor, 3DP N-pTi(3)C(2)T(x) interlayer could dissipate the local current and homogenize Li deposition, accordingly rendering a dendrite-free anode to maintain an ultralong lifespan up to 800 h at 5.0 mA cm(-2)/5.0 mAh cm(-2). Meanwhile, the 3DP N-pTi(3)C(2)T(x) host enables suppressed polysulfide shuttle and accelerated sulfur electrochemistry especially under elevated sulfur loadings. Thus-printed Li-S full cells (3DP N-pTi(3)C(2)T(x)/S parallel to 3DP N-pTi(3)C(2)T(x)@Li) can continuously operate over 250 cycles at a sulfur loading of 7.56 mg cm(-2), accompanied by a capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle. More impressively, an ultimate capacity of 8.47 mAh cm(-2) is harvested after 60 cycles at 12.02 mg cm(-2).

Palladium-cobalt (Pd3Co) nanoparticles are successfully employed as redox promoters in Li-S cells. These cells show high capacity retention and excellent Coulombic efficiency, which are attributed to the fast charge transfer of Pd3Co. Characterization of the Pd3Co nanoparticles is performed via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, fast Fourier transform analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray, and X-ray diffraction. At 0.1 C-rate, the initial discharge and charge capacities of the Pd3Co-sulfur electrodes are 1.24 and 1.36 times higher than those of the bare sulfur electrodes. During the first discharge cycle, the overpotential of the Pd3Co electrode (100 mV) is much lower than that of the bare sulfur cell (190 mV). After 200 cycles at 1.0 C-rate, the Pd3Co-sulfur electrodes deliver a discharge capacity of 544 mAh g(-1) and a high Coulombic efficiency (99.6%). Moreover, the capacity retention of Pd3Co cells is 83.9%. The inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data demonstrate that the Pd3Co nanoparticles can suppress the dissolution of lithium polysulfides and the shuttle effect. These results indicate that the reaction kinetics of the sulfur electrodes is enhanced by the Pd3Co nanoparticles. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

Confining Sulfur within a Zeolite Host Wrapped inside Conducting Polymer Sheaths as Cathode for Li-S Battery	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						Li-S battery; Sulfur Cathode; Zeolites; Conducting Polymer; Cyclability; Rate capability	RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES; HOLLOW CARBON NANOFIBERS; PERFORMANCE; NANOMATERIALS; SPECTROSCOPY; COMPOSITES; TRANSITION; ELECTRODE; NAY	We discuss here the efficient confinement of sulfur and poly-sulfides within a non-carbonaceous ion conducting zeolite (NaY) host wrapped inside electronically conducting polyaniline (PAni) sheaths as a low-cost, high performance cathode for rechargeable lithium-sulfur battery. The sulfur is observed to be confined within the intra crystallite and interstitial spaces of the NaY zeolite and the (PAni) sheaths prevent leakage of sulfur (and polysulfides). Additionally, this NaY-PAni assembly provides distinct pathways for electrons (through PAni) and ions (through NaY channels and across PAni sheaths) during battery operation. Raman spectroscopy confirms the presence of sulfur in diradical S-8* chain forms in the cylindrical pores of NaY and as far our knowledge is concerned, this is the very first result demonstrating the stabilization of sulfur in its metastable state only under confinement at ambient conditions. Sulfur content as high as 75% could be loaded in the NaY-PAni assembly. However, extremely stable battery performance is obtained for slightly lower S-loadings. At sulfur content of 65%, capacity of around 600 mAh g(-1) is obtained at the end of 200 cycles.

Herein, multi-functional nanowall arrays (MNWAs) combining the aforementioned properties are fabricated to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries with high areal sulfur loadings. The integrated conductive networks and top-down vertically aligned Li+ transport channels are beneficial to Li+/e(-) transport, resulting in high rate performance with a discharge capacity of 620 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 9.6 mA cm(-2) for 4 mg cm(-2) sulfur-loaded S/MNWA electrodes. Additionally, the strong PS shuttling suppression via the synergetic effects of physical confinement and chemical adsorption leads to Li-S batteries with a sulfur loading of 10 mg cm(-2) capable of delivering a high areal capacity of 12.4 mA h cm(-2) with a high capacity retention of nearly 85% for over 100 cycles. What's more, the Li-S batteries assembled with 4 mg cm(-2) sulfur-loaded S/MNWA electrodes show an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle over 400 cycles at 3.2 mA cm(-2).

The nanoparticle catalyst is employed to propel electrochemical kinetics in lithium/sulfur batteries. Electrochemical analysis and theoretical simulation evidently verify the critical role of defect sites on catalyzing conversion reactions of sulfur species and reducing energy barriers. As a consequence, the ODFO-enhanced sulfur cathode exhibits a high specific capacity of 1489 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, an excellent rate performance of 644 mA h g(-1) at 10 C, and a superior cycling stability with an average capacity fading rate of as low as 0.055% per cycle under an ultrahigh rate of 10 C. More importantly, even with a high sulfur loading of 11.02 mg cm(-2), the Li/S cell can still deliver an areal capacity of 8.7 mA h cm(-2). at 0.5 C (9.23 mA cm(-2)). Such performance is the highest among reported metal oxide-catalyzed sulfur cathodes.

However, several factors retard the practical use of Li-S batteries including the slow kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) transformation as well as the shuttle effect induced by the diffusion of LiPS that damages the cycling stability of Li-S batteries. In this study, a yolk@shell structured MnS@nitrogen-doped carbon (MnS@N-C) is developed as the S host and polysulfide conversion booster, which offers both the physical confinement of S species and accelerated kinetics toward LiPS catalytic conversion. As a result, the developed S/yolk@shell MnS@N-C delivers a higher rate performance compared to S/yolk@shell MnO@ N-C and S/N-C and long cycle life with a remaining capacity of 636.1 mAh g(-1) after 330 cycles at 0.5C. When equipped with MnS@N-C functional separators, S/yolk@shell MnS@N-C retains a capacity of 504.2 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1C. In addition, S/yolk@shell MnS@N-C also delivers a decent capacity decay of 0.16% per cycle after 300 cycles at 0.5C in a room-temperature Na-S battery.

Due to the dissolution of intermediate Li2Sn (4 < n <= 8), S is needed to be loaded onto substrate to confine it. Up to now, most of the loaded S are particles. The morphology of the loaded S influences the performance. Herein, we find that the deposited S on the surface of carbon shows the nano-layer morphology. And solid electrolyte interface forms on the surface of the layer. The most vital issue is that it exhibits outstanding cycle-stability, after 300 cycles, 98% capacity (754 mAh g(-1)) is retained at 0.5 C. And the nano-layer is kept after long-term cycles, which indicates the nano-layer has well structure stability and plays the role of restraining the dissolution of intermediate Li2Sn (4 < n <= 8) during long-term cycles.

Here, as a membrane-driven approach to address this issue, we demonstrate a new class of polysulfide-breathing (capable of reversibly adsorbing and desorbing polysulfides)/dual (electron and ion) conductive, heterolayered battery separator membranes (denoted as "MEC-AA separators") based on 0D (nanoparticles)/1D (nanofibers) composite mats. The MEC-AA separator is fabricated through an in-series, concurrent electrospraying/electrospinning process. The top layer of the MEC-AA separator comprises close packed mesoporous MCM-41 nanoparticles spatially besieged by multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) wrapped poly (ether imide) (PEI) nanofibers. The MCM-41 in the top layer shows reversible adsorption/desorption of polysulfides, and the MWNT-wrapped PEI nanofibers act as a dual-conductive upper current collector. Preferential deposition of the MWNTs along the PEI nanofibers and dispersion state of the separator components are elucidated theoretically using computational methods. The support layer, which consists of densely packed Al2O3 nanopartides and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers, serves as a mechanically/thermally stable and polysulfide-capturing porous membrane. The unique structure and multifunctionality of the MEC-AA separator allow for substantial improvements in redox reaction kinetics and cycling performance of Li-S cells far beyond those achievable with conventional polyolefin separators. The heterolayered nanomat-based membrane strategy opens a new route toward electrochemically active/permselective advanced battery separators.

Thus, it is still quite essential for us to search an efficient strategy to synergistically overcome these problems. Herein, we design and in-situ deposit a functional delta-MnO2 layer onto the outside surface of porous carbon foam/sulfur composites to synergetic inhibit the polysulfides shuttling and increase sulfur utilization, finally improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. As verified by UV-vis and XPS results, the strong chemical interaction between the MnO2 layer and polysulfide intermediates is characterized to be an internal disproportionation reaction by transferring the absorbed long-chain polysulfides into insoluble polythionate complex. Also, the unique structure possesses high conductivity and good volume expansion tolerance, further guaranteeing the electrode a good cycling stability, rate performance and low self-discharge behavior. The MnO2 coated carbon foam/S electrode displays a remarkable capacity of 1547 mA g(-1) at 0.1 C, and achieves a reversible capacity of 629 mA g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 C. Even with sulfur loading of 2.6 and 4.3 mg cm(-2), the designed electrodes still deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1106 and 963 mA g(-1) at 0.2 C. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the shuttle effect and the passive layer between the separator and electrode still affect the cycling stability and coulombic efficiency seriously. Herein, we develop a 10 mm-thick rGO (reduced graphene oxide) and molybdenum phosphide (MoP) composite coating layer on a Celgard separator to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. The introduction of such a MoP/rGO coating layer on the separator not only impedes the diffusion of polysulfides to the anode but also improves the sulfur utilization. In particular, the 10 nm MoP nanoparticles are very efficient for the polysulfide adsorption. Compared to the pristine Celgard separator, superior electrochemical performance is obtained in both coin cells and pouch cells with the MoP/rGO coated separator. High areal capacity (similar to 3 mA h cm(-2)), good rate performance, and long cycle life (300 cycles) are attained under a sulfur loading of 3.88 mg cm(-2). The capacity decay rate is as low as 0.045% per cycle over 300 cycles. In addition, the pouch cells made by the modified separator with a high sulfur loading of 4.6 mg cm(-2) achieve good electrochemical performance. At 0.1C, the initial discharge capacity is 1083 mA h g(-1), and still remains at 759 mA h g(-1) after 120 cycles. The result reveals the potential practical use of this MoP/rGO coated separator for Li-S batteries.

Herein, a hierarchical core-shell nanocomposites are rationally designed for enhancing the cycle performance of the sulfur cathode, which is constructed by ZIF-8 derived carbon core and hierarchical Mn3O4/N-doped carbon shell (ZPC@HMn3O4/NC). The ZPC core with highly porous structure can provide sufficient space for sulfur loading and physical adsorption of the polysulfides during cycling. Moreover, the hierarchical Mn3O4/NC shell play a dual role in physical restricting and offering strong chemical adsorption of polysulfides. As a result, the ZPC@HMn3O4/NC as sulfur host exhibits superior electrochemical performance.

Using van der Waals corrected density functional theory approach, we report the outstanding anchoring effect of germanene monolayer (GeM), which can trap the LPSs sturdily without disturbing their integrity. The persistent electrical conductivity of GeM upon adsorption of LPSs demonstrates an effective strategy for the enhanced cyclic performance of Li-S batteries while avoiding the shuttling effect and preventing agglomeration at the battery electrodes. It is found that the LPSs adsorbed to GeM with a moderate assortment between -1.8. to -2.6 eV. In addition to the efficient anchoring performance, the electronic properties of GeM also improve upon the adsorption of LPSs. The diffusion barrier energies of LPSs are very small, thus ensuring their ultrafast diffusion and smooth transition during the charge/discharge process of the Li-S battery.

Current research efforts are mostly focused on designing proper host materials for the entrapment and immobilization of polysulfides. Herein, we demonstrate that electrocatalysis may play an unexpected role in Li-S batteries. Nanosized tungsten carbide particles dispersed on the carbonaceous support are prepared from the pyrolysis of phosphotungstic acid-functionalized metal-organic frameworks. Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations demonstrate that they not only have strong affinity toward polysulfide intermediates, but also significantly accelerate the reduction of low-order polysulfides that is otherwise kinetically challenged. Using these supported tungsten carbide nanoparticles as the cathode catalyst, our Li-S batteries achieve large capacity, excellent cycling stability and impressive rate capability.

However, the poor cyclic stability, especially at a high sulfur loading, is the major obstacles retarding their practical use. Inspired by the nacre structure of an abalone, a similar configuration consisting of layered carbon nanotube (CNT) matrix and compactly embedded sulfur is designed as the cathode for Li-S batteries, which are realized by a well-designed unidirectional freeze-drying approach. The compact and lamellar configuration with closely contacted neighboring CNT layers and the strong interaction between the highly conductive network and polysulfides have realized a high sulfur loading with significantly restrained polysulfide shuttling, resulting in a superior cyclic stability and an excellent rate performance for the produced Li-S batteries. Typically, with a sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2), the assembled batteries demonstrate discharge capacities of 1236 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, 498 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and moreover, when the sulfur loading is further increased to 10 mg cm(-2) coupling with a carbon-coated separator, a superhigh areal capacity of 11.0 mAh cm(-2) is achieved.

However, their practical use is hindered by multiple challenges and one of them is capacity decay caused by polysulfide dissolution and the insulating nature of sulfur. In this work, a core-shell structured composite (N-PCB/S) has been successfully prepared by depositing sulfur onto pigment carbon black (PCB) and grafting long chain quaternary ammonium ions via a facile method. These functional groups on the pigment carbon black can immobilize the inner layer of sulfur. And the grafted long chain quaternary ammonium ions could insert into the sulfur layer and anchor the outer layer polysulfides because of the electrostatic attraction between the quaternary ammonium cations and polysulfide anions. Therefore, the N-PCB/S composite electrode exhibits great improvement in both cycling performance and rate capability as compared to pristine sulfur and PCB/S composite electrodes, even when the sulfur content of the N-PCB/S composite is as high as 85%. At current densities of 0.1 and 1C, the N-PCB/S composite electrode delivered high reversible specific capacities of similar to 1010 and 746 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles, respectively.

The electrolyte was composed of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (Li[TFSA]), tetraglyme (G4), and a hydrofluoroether solvent (HFE) in a molar ratio of 1:1:6.2, in which Li+ and G4 formed a 1:1 complex cation of {Li(G4)(+). The Li22Sn5 electrode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 500 mAhg(-1) in this electrolyte; however, the capacity decreased with increased numbers of charge-discharge cycles. This was attributed to the Li-Sn alloy's volume change in the electrode during the electrochemical reaction. To examine the behavior of the electrode material in a lithium-sulfur battery, a full cell consisting of a Li22Sn5 anode, S cathode, and [Li(G4)][TFSA]/HFE electrolyte was fabricated. The cell was discharged and charged stably without severe side reactions. The dissolution of lithium polysulfides, reaction intermediates with the sulfur cathode, was effectively suppressed in the electrolyte, leading to efficient charge-discharge cycling of the Li22Sn5-S cell.

However, the "shuttle effect" of soluble polysulfides and sluggish electrochemical redox kinetics of Li-S batteries could cause a broken electrode structure and poor electrochemical performance. Herein, a high-performance and stable Li-S battery has been demonstrated by employing organo-polysulfide chain modified acetylene black (ABPS) as the coating layer on the separator. In addition to the traditional advantages of fast electron transport and polysulfide-interception ability of the carbon coating layer, the grafted organo-polysulfide chain endows the ABPS coating layer with permselectivity for lithium ion against polysulfides, electrocatalytic ability for the sluggish redox kinetics and self-repairing ability for the broken electrode. Hence, the battery prepared using an ABPS-coated separator delivers the best cycling performance (970 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles) and rate performance (805 mA h g(-1) at 2 C) as compared to the cells using acetylene black (AB)-coated or Celgard separators. Moreover, the Li-S battery prepared using an ABPS-coated separator exhibits a stable cycling performance at 1 C over 500 cycles with a low degradation of 0.04% per cycle, and a high coulombic efficiency (near 100%). Furthermore, as the sulfur loading was increased to 6.8 mg cm(-2), the Li-S battery using the ABPS-coated separator still could deliver a high areal capacity of 6.03 mA h cm(-2) with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S = 4, mu L-electrolyte mg(S)(-1)) after 170 cycles. Significantly, ABPS is an effective coating layer material for improving and stabilizing Li-S batteries.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur and "shuttle effect" of intermediate lithium polysulfides hinders its practical utilization. Herein, we demonstrate a facile dip-coating process to construct coaxial-cable carbon structure directly on the fibers of textile as sulfur host. Specifically, textile is dip-coated in the suspension of CNTs, CNT/sulfur hybrid and graphene in sequence. After drying, three corresponding layers are spontaneously formed on the fibers of the textiles due to Van der Waals force. The composite cathode delivers a reversible discharge capacity as high as 913.0 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C and excellent cycling stability with a retention rate of 88% after 200 cycles with a sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2). The excellent performance is ascribed to the high absorption capability of polysulfides in the hierarchical porous structures, excellent conductivity of CNT, and effective shuttle suppression of polysulfides by graphene sheet. The process reported in this work can provide a new way to synthesize flexible and robust sulfur cathode for Li-S battery application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This micro-meso-macroporous electrode is composed of interwoven carbon fibers with the carbon nanofoam firmly attached to them. The nanofoam plate functions as a reservoir to store the active material and localize the dissolved polysulfides, stabilizing the electrochemical reaction within the cathode region.

Here, we develop a facile hydrothermal method for the large scale synthesis of sulfur hosts consisting of three-dimensional graphene aerogel with tiny TiO2 nanoparticles (5-10 nm) uniformly dispersed on the graphene sheet (GA-TiO2). The obtained GA-TiO2 composites have a high surface area of approximate to 360 m(2) g(-1) and a hierarchical porous structure, which facilitates the encapsulation of sulfur in the carbon matrix. The resultant GA-TiO2/S composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 810 mA h g(-1) with an ultralow capacity fading of 0.054% per cycle over 700 cycles at 2C, and a high rate (5C) performance (396 mA h g(-1)). Such architecture design paves a new way to synthesize well-defined sulfur hosts to tackle the challenges for high performance Li-S batteries.

Graphene is one of the most promising carbon supports for sulfur, thanks to its excellent conductivity and to the possibility of tailoring its chemical-physical properties, introducing heteroatoms in its structure. By using first principle density functional theory simulations, this work aims at studying the effect of doping graphene with group III elements (B, Al, Ga) on its electronic properties and on its chemical affinity towards lithium polysulfides. Our results show that Al and Ga doping strongly modify the local structure of the lattice near heteroatom site and generate a charge transfer between the dopant and its nearest neighbor carbon atoms. This effect makes the substrate more polar and greatly enhances the adsorption energy of polysulfides.

We find that a considerable amount of Li2S is consumed amidst the first charge, and most of Li2S disappears at the end of the second charge. During the charge process, additional sulfur material is formed and contributes to a significant enhancement of the discharge capacity (similar to 1400 mAh/g), compared with a control cell (similar to 1260 mAh/g) without Li2S. Moreover, the Li2S containing cell exhibits much higher cycling stability (a 31% increase from similar to 840 to similar to 1100 mAh/g in the 100th cycle) and rate capability (a 30% increase from similar to 580 to similar to 750 mAh/g at 2 C) than the control cell. Our results indicate that adopting Li2S-containing separator is highly effective to improving the electrochemical performances of Li-S cells.

The pore structures of microporous carbons were completely replicated from a thin silica framework and could be tailored greatly by changing the organic/inorganic ratio. The nitrogen atoms doped into the carbon framework were issued from high-nitrogen-content HMMM precursors, and the nitrogen content could be adjusted in a wide range by changing the phenolic resol/HMMM ratio. Moreover, the porous structure and nitrogen content could be simultaneously controlled, allowing the preparation of a series of microporous carbons with almost the same microstructures (BET surface areas of ca.1900 m(2).g(-1) and pore volumes of ca. 1.2 cm(3).g(-1), and the same pore size distributions) but with different nitrogen contents (0-12 wt %). These results provided a general method to synthesize nitrogen-doped microporous carbons and allowed these materials to serve as a model system to illustrate the role of nitrogen content on the performance of the carbons. When used as the supports for sulfur cathodes, only an appropriate nitrogen content of ca. 6.3 wt % was found to effectively improve sulfur utilization and cycle life of the sulfur cathodes. The resulting sulfur cathodes could deliver an outstanding reversible discharge capacity of 1054 mAh.g(-1) at 0.5 C after 100 cycles.

Herein, we utilize high specific surface area N-doped graphene materials (NGM) as sulfur hosts with high sulfur loading contents reaching 92 wt%. Meanwhile, small amounts of ultrasmall-MoS2/graphene composites (MoS2-G) which can act as multifunctional additives to anchor lithium polysulfides and promote their conversion are added into the cathode. Moreover, the ultrasmall-MoS2 nanoparticles with (100) surfaces can anchor Li2S6 strongly by forming Mo-S bonds with a binding energy of 4.19 eV. With the synergistic effects of the NGM sulfur host and the MoS2-G multifunctional additives, the Li-S batteries displayed stable cycling performance and good rate capability at high sulfur loading content.

Herein, the first principle density functional theory (DFT) is adopted to investigate a high-performance sulfur host material based on oxygen-defective TiO2 (D-TiO2). The adsorption energy comparisons and Gibbs free energy analyses verify that D-TiO2 has relatively better performances than defect-free TiO2 in terms of anchoring effect and catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Meanwhile, D-TiO2 is capable of absorbing the most soluble and diffusive long-chain polysulfides. The newly designed D-TiO2 composited with three-dimensional graphene aerogel (D-TiO2@Gr) has been shown to be an excellent sulfur host, maintaining a specific discharge capacity of 1,049.3 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 1C with a sulfur loading of 3.2 mgcm(-2). Even with the sulfur mass loading increasing to 13.7 mgcm(-2), an impressive stable cycling is obtained with an initial areal capacity of 14.6 mAhcm(-2), confirming the effective enhancement of electrochemical performance by the oxygen defects. The DFT calculations shed lights on the enhancement mechanism of the oxygen defects and provide some guidance for designing advanced sulfur host materials.

However, the exploration of ideal cathodes that can suppress the shuttling of all polysulfides species is challenging. Herein, we propose an ingenious and effective strategy for constructing hybrid-crystal-phase TiO2/covalent organic framework (HCPT@COF) composites where hybrid anatase/rutile TiO2 nanodots (10 nm) are uniformly embedded in the interlayers of porous COFs. The synthesis was realized via a multiple-step reaction relay accompanying by a pseudo-topotactic transformation of three-dimensional layered structures from 1,4-dicyanobenzene monomer-embedded Ti-intermediate networks to HCPT nanodots-embedded COF frameworks. The HCPT@COF/S cathodes show superior comprehensive performance such as high specific capacity, long cycling stability, and remarkable rate capability for Li-S batteries, owing to the complementary anchoring effect of hybrid anatase/rutile TiO2 in the HCPT@COF composite, which is evidenced by substantial characterizations including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.

Here, a heterophase V2O3-VN yolk-shell nanosphere encapsulated by a nitrogen-doped carbon layer has been designed to address the problems of the short cycle life and rapid capacity decay of Li-S batteries synchronously. The structural merits comprise efficient polysulfide anchoring (V2O3), rapid electron transfer (VN) and a reinforced frame (N-doped carbon). The assembled cathode based on the V2O3-VN@NC sulfur host delivered a high initial capacity of 1352 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C with excellent rate performance (797 mA h g(-1) at 2C) and favorable cycle stability with a low capacity-decay rate of only 0.038% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1C. Even with a high sulfur loading of 3.95 mg cm(-2), an initial capacity of 954 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C could be achieved, along with a good capacity retention of 75.1% after 150 cycles.

Herein, a multifunctional Janus separator is designed by integrating temperature endurable electrospinning polyimide nonwovens with a copper nanowire-graphene nanosheet functional layer and a rigid lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide-polyethylene oxide matrix. Such architecture offers multifold advantages: i) intrinsically high dimensional stability and flame-retardant capability, ii) excellent electrolyte wettability and effective metal dendritic growth inhibition, and iii) powerful physical blockage/chemical anchoring capability for the shuttled polysulfides. As a consequence, the as constructed lithium-sulfur battery using a pure sulfur cathode displays an outstandingly high discharge capacity of 1402.1 mAh g(-1) and a record high cycling stability (approximately average 0.24% capacity decay per cycle within 300 cycles) at 80 degrees C, outperforming the state-of-the-art results in the literature. Promisingly, a high sulfur mass loading of approximate to 3.0 mg cm(-2) and a record low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6.0 are achieved. This functional separator also performs well for a high temperature magnesium-sulfur battery. This work demonstrates a new concept for high performance metal-sulfur battery design and promises safe and durable operation of the next generation energy storage systems.

The improvement of Li-S cell electrochemical performance in the presence of TiS2 has been attributed to the ability of TiS2 in adsorbing polysulfide. To maximize the interaction between polysulfides and TiS2, the 2-dimensional (2D) TiS2 nano-sheets with highly exposed TiS2 surface area has been successfully synthesized by a two-step sonication synthetic procedure. The 2D TiS2 particles are micron size in the basal plane direction and are nano-sized along the c-axis direction. 2D TiS2 nano-sheets may adsorb polysulfides more effectively than the raw TiS2 powder. Li-S cells with 2D TiS2 nano-sheets additive exhibit better discharge rate capability and significantly reduced capacity-fading after a long term cell cycling. This improvement can be partially attributed to the uniform distribution of 2D TiS2 nano-sheets particles within the sulfur cathode matrix, which induces more uniform sulfur and lithium sulfide deposition during the cell charge and discharge.

In this work, MnO2 nanosheets/carbon nanotubes composites are synthesized via a simple and rapid hydrothermal deposit route. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as conductive network for electron. MnO2 nanosheets provide numerous sites to form strong chemical binding with polysulfide.

Here we demonstrate that as much as 88.5 wt% of sulphur could be effectively coupled with high-conductivity graphene (HCG) powder, using a simple one-step ball milling process to obtain sea sponge-like composites wherein sulphur was effectively accommodated within a framework of three-dimensional (3D) networks of interconnected graphene flakes. On the basis of the extremely low defect density, high C/O ratio (24.64) and ultrahigh electrical conductivity (2.05 x 10(5) S m(-1)), the HCG networks provided 3D super-highways for ionic and electronic transport, while enabling self-healing to help maintain structural integrity. The mechanical alloying effects resulted in S incorporation into the graphene lattice, thus helping to retain polysulphides within the cathodes. This resulted in a very effective utilization of sulphur in the cathode, so that Li-S/HCG battery cells were realized to deliver a remarkably high full-cathode capacity, a high areal capacity and energy density, an excellent rate-performance and a high cycling stability (4.78 mA h cm(-2) and 1642 W h kg(-1) at a sulphur load of 6.0 mg cm(-2); 555.7 mA h g(-1) at 5C; 519 mA h g(-1) at 2C after 500 cycles).

Here, we report a scalable electrospinning technique by using poly(tetrafluoroethylene) as a pore template, boric acid as a cross-linking agent, and polyvinyl alcohol and polyurethane as dual carbon precursors to fabricate flexible PCNFs with tunable geometries and macro/meso/microporous structures. In the water solvent, the negatively charged template cross-links with the positively charged carbon precursors to form a stable sol for electrospinning. By varying the mass ratios of these precursors, the electrospun hybrid nanofibers are directly transformed into BF-N-O doped PCNFs with tunable macro-, meso-, and micropores after carbonization. The porosity of an individual PCNF is as high as similar to 85%, and the pore volume can be tuned from 0.23 to 0.58 cm(3).g(-1). When constructing high-sulfur-content (86 wt %) electrodes with the freestanding PCNF films, the porous structures with rich electroactive sites provide rapid pathways for polyanions and have strong chemisorption of poly-sulfides, leading to a great electrochemical performance. The reported strategy offers a new perspective for synthesizing hierarchical PCNFs with appealing applications.

Among diverse sulfur-based cathodes, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) cathode delivered superior electrochemical performance. However, the sulfur content of S@pPAN is relatively low (<50 wt%), which significantly limits the energy density. Herein, a hydrogel SA-Cu binder was proposed with a crosslinking network constructed by Cu2+ ions. The introduction of Cu2+ ions enabled excellent electrochemical behaviors of S@pPAN cathode even with high sulfur content of 52.6 wt% via chemical interaction with sulfur and polysulfide. Moreover, a favorable cathode interphase was formed containing electrochemically active and conductive CuSx. S@pPAN/SA-Cu exhibited a high sulfur utilization of 85.3%, long cycling stability over 1000 cycles and remarkable capacity of 1200 mAh g(s)(-1) even at 10 C. Furthermore, ascribed to the improved electrode structure, high-loading electrode (sulfur loading: 4mg cm(-2)) displayed stable cycling with areal capacity of 5.26 mAh cm(-2) (1315 mAh g(s)(-1)) after 40 cycles. This study provides new directions to prepare high-sulfur content and high-loading S@pPAN cathode for higher energy density.

Relative to the total mass of all the electrode components, the CNFP/sulfur anode exhibits a reversible capacity of similar to 310 mAh g(-1). Moreover, the CNFP/sulfur anode maintains 95% of capacity after 1000 cycles and exhibits considerably better high-power capability than the graphite anode. Different from the conventional lithium-sulfur batteries that are based on the conversion reaction of sulfur to Li2S in the potential range of 3.0-1.5 V vs. Li/Li+, it is assumed that the reversible Li-ion storage ability of sulfur below 1.5 V vs. Li/Li+ in the CNFP matrix can be attributed to the rapid adsorption/desorption of Li-ions on the surface of sulfur. The average working voltage of 3.0 V for a full cell consisting of CNFP/sulfur anode and LiFePO4 cathode demonstrates the successful application of carbon/sulfur anode in Li-ion batteries.

Beyond Li-ion, Li-S battery could be one of the most promising technologies, but challenges such as lithium polysulfide shuttling, sluggish reaction kinetics and low areal sulfur loading (<2.0 mg cm(-2)) remain. Herein, we report a multifunctional electrode composite consists of conducting polymer-carbon complex where the sulfur loading can reach as high as similar to 75 wt %. Owing to high electrical conductivity and inherent heteroatom compositions of conductive polymers, composite electrodes are capable of suppressing polysulfide shuttling and enhance reaction kinetics via catalysis. As a result, these composite electrodes deliver outstanding electrochemical performance with the specific capacity of similar to 1100 mAhg(-1) for more than 100 cycles. A one-pot and straightforward procedure at ambient conditions to prepare these composite electrodes are demonstrated. (c) 201(Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Mediated Li-S Flow Battery for Grid-Scale Energy Storage	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						flow battery; energy storage; grid scale; lithium; sulfur; redox targeting	STABILITY; CHEMISTRY; PROGRESS; DENSITY	Lithium-sulfur is a "beyond-Li-ion" battery chemistry attractive for its high energy density coupled with low-cost sulfur. Expanding to the MWh required for grid scale energy storage, however, requires a different approach for reasons of safety, scalability, and cost. Here we demonstrate the marriage of the redox-targeting scheme to the engineered Li solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), enabling a scalable, high efficiency, membrane-less Li-S redox flow battery. In this hybrid flow battery architecture, the Li anode is housed in the electrochemical cell, while the solid sulfur is safely kept in a separate catholyte reservoir and electrolyte is pumped over the sulfur and into the electrochemical cell. Electrochemically facile decamethylferrocene and cobaltocene are chosen as redox mediators to kickstart the initial reduction of solid S into soluble polysulfides and final reduction of polysulfides into solid Li2S, precluding the need for conductive carbons. On the anode side, a LiI and LiNO3 pretreatment strategy encourages a stable SEI and lessens capacity fade, avoiding use of ion-selective separators. Complementary materials characterization confirms the uniform distribution of LiI in the SEI, while SEM confirms the presence of lower surface area globular Li deposition and UV-vis corroborates evolution of the polysulfide species. Equivalent areal loadings of up to 50 mg(s) cm(-2) (84 mAh cm(-2)) are demonstrated, with high capacity and voltage efficiency at 1-2 mg(s) cm(-2 ) (973 mAh g(s)(-1) and 81.3% VE in static cells and 1142 mAh g(s)(-1) and 86.9% VE in flow cells). These results imply that the fundamental Li-S chemistry and SEI engineering strategies can be adapted to the hybrid redox flow battery architecture, obviating the need for ion-selective membranes or flowing carbon additives, and offering a potential pathway for inexpensive, scalable, and safe MWh scale Li-S energy storage.

As a multifunctional current-collector-free cathode, the conductive dense layer of the C/SiO2 membrane offers hierarchical macropores as an ideal sulfur host to alleviate the volume expansion of sulfur species and facilitate ion/electrolyte transport for fast kinetics, as well as spongelike pores to enable high sulfur loading. The triple-layer structured membrane cathode enables the filling of most sulfur species in the macropores and additional loading of a thin sulfur slurry on the membrane surface, which facilitates ion/electrolyte transport with faster kinetics than the conventional S/C slurry-based cathode. Furthermore, density functional theory simulations and visual adsorption measurements confirm the critical role of the doped SiO2 nanoparticles (similar to 10 nm) in the asymmetric C membrane in suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides via chemisorption and electrocatalysis. The rationally designed C/SiO2 membrane cathodes demonstrate long-term cycling stability of 300 cycles at a high sulfur loading of 2.8 mg cm(-2) with a sulfur content of similar to 75%. This scalable yet flexible self-supporting cathode design presents a useful strategy for realizing practical applications of high-performance Li-S batteries.

This hybrid is constructed with two-dimensional N-doped graphene nanosheets wrapping one-dimensional nanotubes self-assembled by vertically oriented few-layered 1T-MoS2. Due to its well-designed nanoarchitecture, the hybrid owns several advantages: the metallic 1T-MoS2 and highly conductive graphene skeleton facilitates electron transfer; with abundant specific area and electrocatalytic active sites, the unique hollow nano architecture enables efficient electrolyte infiltration and Li-ion transfer. The experiments of lithium polysulfides adsorption and in-situ Raman spectra confirm that the hybrid acts as both excellent chemical absorbant and high-efficiency electrocatalyst for the transition of long-chain lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from these merits, the cathode delivers outstanding electrochemical properties with a superior reversible capacity of 1219 mAh g(-1) (after 200 cycles at 0.2 C), a low long-term cycling capacity decay of 0.039% per cycle (500 cycles at 1 C), and excellent rate performances.

Herein, for the first time, low-cost, eco-friendly, and hydrophilic cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are proposed as a multifunctional polysulfide stopper for Li-S batteries with high performance. CNCs display an intrinsically high aspect ratio and a large surface area and contain a large amount of hydroxyl groups offering a facile platform for chemical interactions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the electron-rich functional groups on CNCs deliver robust binding energies with polysulfides. In this work, CNCs not only firmly confine sulfur and polysulfides in the cathode as a robust binder, but also further hinder polysulfide shuttling to the Li anode as a polysulfide stopper on a separator. Consequently, the as-prepared Li-S batteries demonstrate outstanding cycling performance even under the conditions of high sulfur content of 90 wt % (63 wt % in the cathode), high loading of 8.5 mg cm(-2), and high temperature of 60 degrees C. These results sufficiently demonstrate that CNCs have significant application potential in Li-S battery technologies.

Here we report a novel composite sulfur electrode composed of organic polysulfane grafted directly on mesoporous graphene. Compared with sulfur chain based conventional organosulfur electrodes, the well-defined organic polysulfane with carbon skeleton has excellent structural stability during electrochemical cycling. Further, the mesopores on graphene sheets in this unique architecture can serve as channels to effectively facilitate rapid ion transport, leading to excellent battery performance. When tested as a free-standing electrode in a Li-S battery, the composite electrode demonstrates high capacity (1045 mAh/g at 1 C), superior rate capability (723 mAh/g at 20 C), excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 95.3% after 1000 cycles at 5 C). The electrode materials still present good electrochemical performance even under high mass loading of sulfur (up to 20.3 mg/cm(2)). The remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to the high structural stability and excellent electrical conductivity of the carbon skeleton and to the porous architecture of electrode that promotes fast ion transport. The greatly enhanced capacity and durability of the composite electrode make it ideally suited for the next-generation high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, Li metal anode is prone to react with soluble polysulfide produced during the charge/discharge process, leading to the loss of active materials, corrosion of Li metal and fast cell capacity decay. Besides, Li metal anode is also confronted with Li dendrite growth related serious safety concerns. Here, a conformal thin layer of Sn is coated on Li metal surface, which could protect Li metal anode from the parasitic reactions, accommodate the huge volume change and suppress dendritic lithium growth. The symmetric cell using Li foil with Sn coating demonstrates excellent cycling performance with low voltage polarization and uniform, dense and dendrite-free electrodeposited Li metal. In addition, LSBs with Sn coated Li metal anode shows a high specific capacity (1423.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), good rate performance and stable cycling performance with a high Coulombic efficiency of similar to 99.5% for 500 cycles at 2 C. The superior electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to the Sn protective layer which could enable the fast Li+ transport at the electrode/electrolyte interface, the suppression of Li dendrite growth and the effective minimization of active sulfur loss. This work provides a novel approach and a significant step towards costeffective, large-scalable and long-cycling stable LSBs.

The inner diameter and wall thickness of the PNCNTs are about 55nm and 22nm, respectively. This material shows extremely promising properties for both supercapacitors and for encapsulating sulfur as a superior cathode material for high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. At a current density of 0.5Ag(-1), PNCNT presents a high specific capacitance of 210Fg(-1), as well as excellent cycling stability at a current density of 2Ag(-1). When the S/PNCNT composite was tested as the cathode material for Li-S batteries, the initial discharge capacity was 1341mAhg(-1) at a current rate of 1C and, even after 50cycles at the same rate, the high reversible capacity was retained at 933mAhg(-1). The promising electrochemical energy-storage performance of the PNCNTs can be attributed to their excellent conductivity, large surface area, nitrogen doping, and unique pore-size distribution.

Herein, the nanocages consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hierarchically porous carbon (CNT-NC@GC) are synthesized using bimetallic core-shell metal-organic frameworks as precursor. CNTs are in situ introduced onto the inner/outer surface of the nanocages to form a three-dimensional conductive network throughout the entire electrode for the favorable electrolyte penetration and improved electrons/ions transfer. Abundant N-doping and Co nanoparticles decoration in the tips of CNTs or on the surface of GC shells are beneficial to immobilize soluble polysulfides. Moreover, the modified Co nanoparticles possess chemisorption and electrocatalytic activity for sulfur conversion, which can promote redox kinetics of the polysulfides and improve the cycling stability. As a result, the as-prepared CNTs-grafted nitrogen-doped carbon@graphitic carbon nanocages cathode containing 79.2 wt% of sulfur (CNT-NC@GC/S) delivers a high discharge capacity of 743 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at a current density of 1.0C with a capacity retention of 83.6%. And the cathode with high areal sulfur loading of 4.95 mg cm(-2) shows a high areal capacity of 4.01 mA h cm(-2) over 100 cycles. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we have simultaneously addressed these chal-lenges by developing a multifunctional PP separator covered by functional layers to regulate the interfacial electrochemistry in LSBs. The functional layer consisting of VS4 and tannin acid can synergistically work as redox mediators to catalyze the sulfur conversion and a buffer layer to regulate Li ions stripping/deposition behaviors. The LSBs with the as-designed multifunctional separator can deliver a considerable capacity of more than 3 mA h cm(-2) after 400 cycles, realize a stable cycling performance for 1200 cycles, and show excellent thermal tolerance even at a high temperature of 130 ?. By combining with the feasible manufacturing process, this separator engineering strategy bridges the electrode reactions initially and demonstrates safe LSBs for practical application.

However, the sulfur cathode undergoes a stepwise reduction process and generates multiple soluble polysulfide intermediates; for the further conversion from the dissolved intermediates to the final solid product (Li2S), the surface nucleation barrier limits the speed of the electrochemical precipitation, resulting in serious polysulfide diffusion loss and low sulfur utilization. Herein, the trace Li2S (tLi(2)S) is modified on the carbon fiber (CF) skeleton as preloaded crystal nuclei to boost the electrokinetics of Li2S deposition in the initial cycle. The trace Li2S decreases the nucleation barrier on the modified electrode (tLi(2)S@CF), resulting in a high initial capacity of 1423 mAh g(-1) for the Li2S6 catholyte (0.2 C), which corresponds to a nearly 100% utilization of Li2S6. Furthermore, the trace Li2S nuclei induce a uniform distribution of the redeposited active materials, and the uniform distribution persists in the following cycles, which benefits the cycle life significantly. The sulfur cathode based on the tLi(2)S@CF matrix maintains a capacity of 1106 mAh g(-1) at 1 C rate after 100 cycles. The strategy can provide a new avenue for the rational design of the sulfur cathode.

Herein, a unique nanocatalyst comprising beta-NiOOH nanosheets uniformly implanted on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNT@NiOOH) was designed and synthesized for sulfur cathodes. The beta-NiOOH nanosheets have great capability of adsorbing LiPSs as well as superior catalytic activity for accelerating LiPS conversion, providing a more efficient method to restrain shuttle effects and improve the kinetics of SRR. Moreover, the nanometer-scale epitaxial growth and uniform distribution of beta-NiOOH on CNTs provide a multidimensional catalytic skeleton with sufficient accessible active surfaces, unimpeded LiPS diffusion pathways, and resultant high utilization of active sites. Simultaneously, stable electron transportation pathways are also obtained by being synthesized on CNTs to avoid the faultiness of poor electron conductivity of beta-NiOOH. These conspicuous advantages contribute to fully exert the catalytic and LiPS anchoring potential of CNT@NiOOH, bringing about the ultralong cycle performance and excellent capacity reversibility at a high discharge rate. Reticular CNT@NiOOH frameworks are assembled with the sulfur composite materials (SCMs) by a self-assembly method, and a super-high capacity of 813.3 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 0.5 C with a small capacity degradation of 0.07% per cycle is achieved. Furthermore, the 3 A h pouch-type cell with the SCM/CNT@NiOOH cathode attains a super-high energy density of about 320 W h kg(-1) and shows a superior capacity retention as high as 75.9% after 50 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides a promising method to accelerate the SRR process and restrain the shuttle effects for practical long-life and high-capacity Li-sulfur batteries.

The as-prepared MCF exhibits a high specific surface area of 1478.55 m(2) g(-1) and a commendable pore size distribution for impregnating sulfur. After sulfur loaded in MCF, the relationship between pore size distribution of mesoporous carbon foam/sulfur nanocomposite (MCF/S) and the content of loaded sulfur is investigated in detail, which impacts on subtle variation of lithium storage performance. MCF/S (57.22 wt%) delivers an initial discharge of 1285 mA h g(-1) and retains 878 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles. Compared with pristine sulfur, MCF/S cathodes display enhanced electrochemical performances, which can be attributed to the cross-linked hierarchical structure of MCF conductive matrix. Based on the advantages of the template-free Pechini method such as low cost, relative simplicity and atomic-scaled mixing, the MCF with hierarchical porous structure can be generalized to other practical applications including electrochemical double-layer capacitors, adsorption, separation, catalyst supports, etc. In addition, we believe that this modified Pechini method is general and can be extended to the fabrication of other types of mesoporous carbon by changing metal salts and organic reagents.

A good way to suppress the shuttle effect is to effectively anchor dissoluble lithium polysulfides (LPSs, Li2Sn) on appropriate substrates. Previous studies have revealed that Li of Li2Sn is prone to interact with the N of N-containing materials to form Li-N bonds. In this work, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we explored the possibility to form Li bonds on ten different N-containing monolayers, including BN, C2N, C2N6S3, C9N4, a covalent triazine framework (CTF), g-C3N4, p-C3N4, C3N5, S-N2S, and T-N2S, by examining the adsorption behavior of Li2Sn (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8) on these two-dimensional (2D) anchoring materials (AMs), and investigated the performance of the formed Li bonds (if any) in inhibiting the shuttle effect. By comparing and analyzing the nitrogen content, the N-containing pore size, charge transfer, and Li bonds, we found that the N content and N-containing pore size correlate with the number of Li bonds, and the formed Li-N bonds between LPSs and AMs correspond well with the adsorption energies of the LPSs. The C9N4 and C2N6S3 monolayers were identified as promising AMs in Li-S batteries. From the view of Li bonds, this work provides guidelines for designing 2D N-containing materials as anchoring materials to reduce the shuttle effect in Li-S batteries, and thus improving the performance of Li-S batteries.

Here, a novel potentiostatic (p-stat) lithiation method was developed to fabricate Li2Sx cathode. The pre-lithiated Li2Sx cathode can be used to pair with the Li metal free anode to make a full cell with better safety. The dissolution of the polysulfide in electrolyte is the main problem in S cathode, which leads to severe active material loss during lithiation process. Normally, the way to alleviate the dissolution of polysulfide is by trapping the polysulfide from diffusing into the electrolyte. In this work, it is innovatively raised the p-stat lithiation method which can suppress the formation of polysulfides. As a result, dissolution of polysulfide species could be kinetically suppressed. The p-stat lithiated Li2Sx cathode exhibits higher capacity performance (around 400 mAh g(-1)) than the galvanostatic (g-stat) lithiated Li2Sx cathode. The Li metal free full cell assembled by pairing p-stat lithiated Li2Sx cathode with graphite anode shows stable cyclability.

Herein, a LiNO3-free electrolyte was designed to simultaneously inhibit the PS shuttle and lithium dendrite problem, with pure 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) as the solvent, due to the low K-sp of polysulfide as well as the stable SEI on lithium. As a synergistic effect, it enabled the Li-S batteries to achieve 95% coulombic efficiency, 3 times longer cycle life, and a slower self-discharging rate at 55 degrees C compared to the DOL/DME blend solvent. Four kinds of batteries, from coins to soft packages, were carried out to confirm the superiority of this electrolyte. Li-S soft package batteries with 4000 mAh capacity were assembled, achieving the specific energy of 350 Wh kg(-1) and specific power of 60 W kg(-1), which could cycle over 30 times at 0.2 C with high capacity retention of 80%. It is among the best comprehensive Li-S batteries performance reported using LiNO3-free electrolyte.

This is proved by many experiment studies in the past decades. Therefore, the most efficient method for improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery is inhibiting this shuttle effect. Based on this idea, we design a free-standing carpet-like TiO2 nanofiber skeleton interlayer in the Li-S battery. This advanced interlayer could stem the transfer of soluble polysulfide, which shuttle between cathode and anode. Besides, the nanofiber structure in the carpet-like TiO2 nanofiber skeleton interlayer provides channels for the rapid transport of lithium-ions. Considering all these advantages, the as-prepared TiO2 interlayer shows perfect electrochemical performance for the Li-S batteries.

J	Luo, J; Zheng, JM				Luo, Jie; Zheng, Jianming			Novel NiCo2O4 nanofibers prepared via electrospinning method as host materials for perfect polysulfide inhibition	IONICS			English	Article						Metal oxides; NiCo2O4; Electrochemical performance; Shuttle effect; Li-S batteries	POROUS CARBON NANOSHEETS; EFFICIENT SULFUR HOSTS; LITHIUM; COMPOSITE; MATRIX	Lithium-sulfur batteries have been widely studied as promising energy storage system due to their high specific capacity and energy density. However, the poor electronic conductivity and severe polysulfide shuttle effect still hinder the practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries. Therefore, improving the electronic conductivity and inhibiting the polysulfide migration are still the hot research topic in lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, ternary metal oxide NiCo2O4 nanofibers are designed as novel sulfur host for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. On the one hand, the polar NiCo2O4 could provide sufficient active site for anchoring the soluble polysulfide. On the other hand, the high electronic conductivity of NiCo2O4 nanofibers could adequately activate insulated sulfur and improve the specific capacity and rate capability of lithium-sulfur batteries. As a result, the as-prepared NiCo2O4 nanofibers/S (NCO-NFs/S) composite cathodes exhibit initial specific capacity of 1238 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. Moreover, the specific capacity of 706 mAh g(-1) could be obtained after 500 cycles at 1 C for the NCO-NFs/S composites.

These properties render CNFs as useful materials in energy applications, including water electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs). Graphitized CNFs manifest huge versatility in EESDs and have been employed as electrode materials, as supports for other electrode materials, and conductive additives. This perspective summarizes the production methods, structural aspects, and energy applications of graphitized CNFs. Different design strategies have been employed to produce CNFs with diverse and distinct morphologies and structures. Their fabrication methods, along with precursors and dopants or cocatalysts, impact the overall structural, functional, and topographical properties. Recent developments on the state-of-the-art interests of graphitic CNFs in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), supercapacitors, and water splitting have explored the many possibilities in energy sectors. The assembly and functioning of CNFs in water splitting and EESDs as well as primary challenges are discussed in this perspective.

Its commercialization, however, is mainly hindered by the fast capacity decay induced by the polysulfide shuttle behavior between two electrodes. Herein, we report a scalable production of mesoporous TiO2-carbon nanotubes (MTO-CNTs) in which each mesoporous oval-shaped TiO2 particle is threaded with a CNT in the axis direction. As its one dimensional structure with a self-weaving feature, two different approaches enlisting the use of MTOCNTs as an interlayer between cathode and separator or a capping layer coated directly onto the sulfur cathode, both aiming to suppress the polysulfide shuttle. The threaded structure provides excellent interfacial contact between TiO2 and CNTs allowing CNTs to provide fast and continuous electron pathway toward the TiO2-polysulfide polar adsorption interface, thus dynamically accelerating the redox conversion of the trapped polysulfides. As a result of the synergetic effect, the cell with an ultra-lightweight MTO-CNTs capping layer (merely 0.06mg cm(-2)) exhibits a long-term cyclability with a low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle within 500 cycles at 0.5 C.

The microstructure and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared composites are investigated systematically. It is demonstrated that the polyaniline, with a thickness of approximate to 510 nm, is coated uniformly onto the surface of the S/C composite forming a core/shell structure. The PANI@S/C composite with 43.7 wt% sulfur presents the optimum electrochemical performance, including a large reversible capacity, a good coulombic efficiency, and a high active-sulfur utilization. The formation of the unique core/shell structure in the PANI@S/C composites is responsible for the improvement of the electrochemical performance. In particular, the high-rate charge/discharge capability of the PANI @S/C composites is excellent due to a synergistic effect on the high electrical conductivity from both the conductive carbon black in the matrix and the PANI on the surface. Even at an ultrahigh rate (10C), a maximum discharge capacity of 635.5 mA h per g of sulfur is still retained for the PANI@S/C composite after activation, and the discharge capacity retention is over 60% after 200 cycles.

In this work, a spheres-in-tube carbonaceous nanoarchitecture has been successfully engineered as an effective sulfur host, by encapsulating heteroatom-doped hollow carbon spheres into an intact carbonaceous nanotube (I-HCSs@CT). The structural features including hierarchical porosity and the intact nature of the CT wall and HCS framework have cooperatively endowed I-HCSs@CT with outstanding capability of host loading, good electrical conductivity, a high utilization rate and excellent stability of sulfur. As a result, our sulfur/carbon composites deliver a large discharge capacity of 1426 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C with a high sulfur loading of 72.1 wt%. The obtained electrode demonstrates superior high-rate cycling performance, with a high specific capacity of 746 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C being retained after 500 cycles.

To ensure practical applications in a natural environment, Li-S batteries must be capable of performing normally at low temperature. However, the intrinsic characteristics of S, such as large volume variation, low conductivity, and shuttle effect, hinder its low-temperature applications. Moreover, Li+ transport is poor at low temperatures, resulting in fast capacity deterioration, low-capacity output, and large overpotential. In this study, a free-standing host embedded with CoFe bimetallic nanoparticles has been designed. CoFe functions as an efficient catalyst for the polysulfide conversion. The in situ growth of graphite shells around CoFe bimetallic nanoparticles function as a nanoreactor to confine and absorb polysulfides, and the host is an ideal porous conductivity network for rapid ion transportation, preventing the accumulation of Li2S and alleviating the volume changes during the lithiation/delithiation process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the successive lithiation process from S-8 to Li2S on CoFe is thermodynamically spontaneous, and CoFe has a kinetic catalytic activity for this series of lithiation reactions. Experimentally, rationally designed CoFe@C@CNF cathodes are introduced into Li-S batteries for low-temperature applications. The cathode delivers superior rate capacity (828 mA h g(-1) at 10C) and a low fading rate (0.053% per cycle over 300 cycles). An enhanced capacity (836 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C) and cycling stability (capacity retention rate of 94.5% after 100 cycles) were achieved at -20 degrees C. This study provides a feasible method for developing high-rate and long-life Li-S batteries for low-temperature applications.

Here, we establish a facile and generalizable "coordination-assisted self-assembly" for encapsulation of aggregation-free and highly dispersed metal nanoparticles inside the mesoporous carbon frameworks. The choice of pyrogallol as phenolic resin precursor is essential for the in situ encapsulation, because the strong coordination between the three hydroxide groups of pyrogallol and metal ions favors the immobilization of transition metal into the mesopores, and then suppress the sintering of metal nanoparticles at high carbonization temperatures. The metal supported mesoporous composites possess the very high loading content of 1.25%-7.27%, tiny particle sizes of 4.3-15.6 nm and high surface area of 475-589 m(2)/g. The unique structure in deed endows high sulfur loading content in the conductive mesoporous carbon channels, and meanwhile metal nanoparticles as catalyst effectively promotes the electrochemical conversion of polysulfides, resulting in a high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability for Li-S batteries.

As a result, Li-S cells with a ZnHMT-based interlayer achieve excellent cyclability over 1000 cycles, superb rate capability up to 5C and a high areal capacity of 5.9 mA h cm(-2) under raised sulfur loading.

Li2S has recently emerged as a promising cathode material, due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 1166 mAh/g and its great potential in the development of lithium-ion sulfur batteries with a lithium-free anode such as graphite. Unfortunately, the electrochemical Li+ intercalation/deintercalation in graphite is highly electrolyte-selective: whereas the process works well in the carbonate electrolytes inherited from Li-ion batteries, it cannot take place in the ether electrolytes commonly used for Li-S batteries, because the cointercalation of the solvent destroys the crystalline structure of graphite. Thus, only very few studies have focused on graphite-based Li-S full cells. In this work, simple graphite-based Li-S full cells were fabricated employing electrolytes beyond the conventional carbonates, in combination with highly loaded Li2S/graphene composite cathodes (Li2S loading: 2.2 mg/cm(2)). In particular, solvate ionic liquids can act as a single-phase electrolyte simultaneously compatible with both the Li2S cathode and the graphite anode and can further improve the battery performance by suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, these lithium-ion sulfur batteries show a stable and reversible charge-discharge behavior, along with a very high Coulombic efficiency.

However, the application of LSBs is still hindered by the "shuttle effect" of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and their sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, a novel strategy for suppressing the "shuttle effect" of LiPSs and facilitating the reaction kinetics is achieved using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with incorporated polar LiNiPO4(LNPO) nanoparticles as a functional coating layer for the separator in LSBs. The synergy between polar LNPO nanoparticles and rGO endowed the cell with enhanced chemical adsorption for LiPSs and promoted the electrochemical kinetics. The cell with the LNPO/rGO-modified separator exhibited ultra-long cycling stability (629 mA h g(-1)at 1.5C after 1400 cycles) and a high areal capacity of 4.2 mA h cm(-2). Furthermore, the reaction mechanism and kinetics of LSBs were revealed byin situX-ray diffraction (XRD) and catalytic kinetics measurement, while the enhanced chemical anchoring of LiPSs was demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and UV-vis spectroscopy. This work provides a new approach for LSBs with ultra-long cycling life and high areal capacity.

Selenium (Se) can greatly mitigate these disadvantages, but its theoretical capacity is relatively low (675 mAh g(-1)). A series of S-x-Se-y compounds supported by chitosan-derived carbon with intertwined carbon nanotube (CC + CNT) carriers exhibit the high capacity of S, the stability of Se, and the excellent conductivity of C, complementing their individual defects. S2Se1/CC + CNT shows the best electrochemical performance (833.2 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles). Characterization results reveal the structure-activity relationships and complex reaction mechanisms of the prepared electrode materials. The overall reactions are a combination of basic Li-S and Li-Se reactions. The discharge steps are clearly identifiable, while the reaction sequences are slightly adjusted and fully integrated when charging. This work provides a foundation for future research and for the practical application of chalcogenides in lithium-metal batteries.

The porous HSN-rGO has a high BET specific surface area of 464.3 m(2) g(-1). The N content in HSN-rGO is 5.27 at.%. The HSN-rGO shows a strong adsorption capability for the soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and more importantly it presents an excellent catalytic capability for the redox conversion of LiPSs. The HSN-rGO modified separator can inhibit the shuttle effect of LiPSs in Li-S battery. Besides, the HSN-rGO based separator has a good electrolyte wettability. The catalytic activity of HSN-rGO and Li+ diffusion property in Li-S battery are well studied quantitatively. The Li-S battery with HSN-rGO-PP separator exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1372.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 681.5 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, and a low-capacity decay rate of 0.055% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 1 C. This study proves the strategy that the HSN-rGO modified separator can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of LiPSs and accelerate the redox reaction kinetics for high-performance Li-S battery.

The effects of transition cation additives on improving rate capability and Coulombic efficiency were observed in the following order: Zn2+ > Cu2+ > Co2+ > Ni2+ > Mn2+ > no salt. With Zn additives, less-accumulation of sulfur and smoother surfaces were observed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) compared to that without additives. The result is consistent with Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (EQCM) measurement, where less increase in mass changes of the anode for Zn additive as compared to Cu and no additive. The findings can be attributed to transition metal sulfides deposited on lithium surface cooperate with lithium sulfide and electrolyte decomposition product resulting in a smoother and more robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films. The enhanced homogeneity of passivation layer greatly hinders the parasitic reactions between lithium metal and polysulfides as well as organic electrolyte, reducing the loss of active material and improving Coulombic efficiency. On the other hand, the uniform and mechanically strong SEI film introduces less undesired lithium plating and further accumulation on active sites, which significantly enhance the long-term stability due to improved surface morphology and chemistry. The results of this study provide a facile method of in-situ chemical formation of passivation layer protecting the lithium metal in batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Robust carbon structure with large specific surface can act as a physical barrier and possess physical adsorption effect on lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). In addition, highly-conductive carbon can improve integral conductivity, leading to the fast charge transport and reaction kinetics. Also, doping heteroatoms could form more active sites to adsorb LiPSs strongly so that modified separator could inhibit the shuttle effect effectively. Moreover, the presence of CoS2 further enhances the ability of modified separator to trap LiPSs owing to the Lewis acid-base action. As a result, the NSPCF@CoS2@C-150 battery can deliver initial discharge capacities of 863.0, 776.2, 649.1 and 489.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2C with a high sulfur loading of 2.04 mg cm(-2), respectively. Notably, when turning the current density back to 0.1C, its discharge capacity can recover to 1008.7 mAh g(-1). In addition, the modified separators exhibit outstanding capacities to restrain the growth of lithium dendrites. It is noteworthy that the flame retardant performances of LiS batteries are improved dramatically owing to the novel structures of modified separators. This rationally designed separator endows Li-S batteries with higher safety and excellent electrochemical performances, providing a feasible strategy for practical application of Li-S batteries.

Successfully employed as cathode material for the lithium metal battery, it exhibits long cycling lifetime and high rate capability with high energy density. Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes can not only enable fast migration to realize excellent rate capability and efficient utilization of the SexS8-x loaded inside, but also provide optimal unidirectional void space to significantly reduce volumetric expansion and the polysulfide shuttling phenomenon during the cycling process. Meanwhile, the graphene layers decorated by element doping and held together by COOH- and OH-enriched poly(acrylic acid) binder can efficiently consolidate SexS8-x molecules inside the carbon nanotubes and prevent the separation of the active materials from the current collector during long-term cycling. Benefiting from these features, the composite presents optimal cycling performance with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 96% and a high reversible capacity of 818 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g(-1). This composite thus represents one of the most promising cathode materials that can give the lithium metal battery long cycle life and remarkable power density.

Polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics in sulfur cathodes significantly degrade the cycle life of Li-S batteries. A modified method is employed to create defects in carbon nanotubes (CNTs), anchoring polysulfides, and accelerating electrochemical reactions. The defect-rich CNTs (D-CNT) enable dramatic improvement in both cycling and rate performance. A specific capacity of 600 mAh g(-1) with a current density of 0.5 C is achieved after 400 cycles, and even at a very high current density (5.0 C), a specific capacity of 434 mAh g(-1) is observed. Cycling stability up to 1000 cycles is also achieved under the conditions of high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte. Theoretical calculations revealed that the improvement is mainly attributable to the electronic structure of defect-rich carbon, which has higher binding energy with polysulfides because of the upshift of the p-band center. Furthermore, rotating disk electrode measurements demonstrate that the defect-rich carbon can accelerate the polysulfide conversion process. It is anticipated that this new design strategy can be the starting point for mediator-like carbon materials with good conductivity and high catalytic activity for Li-S batteries.

In our design, the introduced rGO and CNTs-Li serve as the conductive skeleton for facilitating the fast electron/ion transfer, while the infixing NiS2 catalyst could synchronously entrap the soluble LiPSs and speed up their interconversion. The chemical interaction between NiS2 and LiPSs and the redox kinetics were probed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical measurements, respectively. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of 3D conductive skeleton and polar NiS2 catalyst, the cell with the NiS2@rGO/CNTs-Li modified separator exhibits a high initial capacity of 1515 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and an excellent long-term cycling stability up to 600 cycles with a low decay rate of 0.071% at 2.0 C.

In this work, a dual-oxidation strategy of H2S is designed to synthesize graphene/sulfur composites with a sulfur content as high as 80 wt%. In particular, H2S is bubbled into the aqueous dispersion of graphene oxide (GO) containing H2O2, during which sulfur is generated through the dual oxidation of H2S by H2O2 and GO. Interestingly, the as-formed sulfur is amorphous and strongly anchored on the graphene nanosheets. Benefiting from the structural merits, the graphene/sulfur nanocomposite affords a high specific capacity of 680 mA h g(-1) based on the total mass of the nanocomposite at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1) and good cycle performance with 85% of capacity retained at 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 A g(-1) after 100 cycles. Besides efficiently producing a high-performance cathode for Li-S batteries, the method developed here also offers great promise for pollutant control.

The sulfur-carbon composite, which exploits graphene carbon with a 3D array (3DG-S), was synthesized by a reduction step through a microwave-assisted solvothermal technique and was fully characterized in terms of structure and morphology, thereby revealing suitable features for lithium-cell application. Electrochemical tests of the 3DG-S electrode in a lithium half-cell indicated a capacity ranging from 1200 to 1000mAhg(-1) at currents of C/10 and 1C, respectively. Remarkably, the Li-alloyed anode, namely, LiySiOx-C prepared by the sol-gel method and lithiated by surface treatment, showed suitable performance in a lithium half-cell by using an electrolyte designed for lithium-sulfur batteries. The LiySiOx-C/3DG-S battery was found to exhibit very promising properties with a capacity of approximately 460mAhg(S)(-1) delivered at an average voltage of approximately 1.5V over 200cycles, suggesting that the characterized materials would be suitable candidates for low-cost and high-energy-storage applications.

Herein, we developed a porous binary FeCo-NC material functionalized by dual-site catalytic FeCo species and delicately introduced carbon nanotube (CNT) forest on FeCo-NC surface. The successful decoration of highly dispersed binary Fe and Co species and heavily introduced N species up to 10 at.%, are critical to improve the quality of host interfaces for high-efficiency anchoring/conversion of polar LiPS and electrolyte wetting. The fluffy CNT forest on particulate FeCo-NC can serve as highway for electron conducting and reservoir for confining S/LiPS when physically stacked. Electrochemical measurements indicated binary FeCo-NC/CNT composite serving as host for a 70 wt.% S loading. It showed enhanced absorption and conversion kinetics of LiPS, and improved rate capability and stability of Li-S half-cell.

On the other hand, the presence of lithium metal especially under the highly reactive polysulfide environment causes safety concerns. Herein, we use electrocatalytically active cathode and metallic lithium-free anode to construct Li-ion polysulfide battery with enhanced reversibility and safety. Stabilizing lithium polysulfides and enhancing the reaction kinetics with minimal polarization using platinum/graphene composite holds the key to obtaining better performance, which is realized against conventional metallic lithium as well as pre-lithiated porous silicon electrodes. The electrocatalyst containing cathode composites are comparable with graphene-based electrodes regarding enhanced specific capacity retention and better reversibility in charge/discharge behavior. Furthermore, metallic lithium-free polysulfide batteries displayed exceptional performance with an energy density of 450 Wh kg(-1) considering the weight of both the electroactive materials and a capacity retention of about 70% for 240 charge-discharge cycles.

The electrochemical measurements showed that the resultant CuS@CNT composite electrodes deliver outstanding electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance up to 566.4 F g(-1) and cyclic stability of 94.5 % of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g(-1). A synergistic effect arising from the unique hierarchical structure was responsible for the electrode performance, including a large surface area of 49.3 m(2) g(-1) and active CuS ultrafine nanoneedles firmly bonded to the highly conductive carbon nanotube (CNT) backbone. When used as an electrode material for Li-S batteries, the S@CuS@CNT (S content 59 wt%) exhibited satisfying electrochemical performance. The S@CuS@CNT electrode showed that coulombic efficiency was close to 100 % and capacity maintained more than 500 mA h g(-1) with progressive cycling up to more than 100 cycles even at a high current density. This strategy of stabilizing S with a small amount of copper sulfide nanoneedles can be a very promising method to prepare free-standing cathode material for high-performance Li-S batteries. The fabrication strategy presented here is low cost, facile, and scalable, which can be considered as a promising material for large-scale energy storage device. In particular, the use of CNT as backbone for the growth of active materials presents many potential merits owing to its lightweight, biodegradable, and stretchable characteristics.

Herein, a flexible asymmetric porous carbon membrane doped with iron carbide (FexC) nanoparticles was designed by a facile phase-inversion method to serve as an integrated electrode for high-performance Li-S batteries, replacing the traditional Al foil current collector. The strong Li-N binding of the membranes and Fe-S chemical adsorption of FexC can trap polysulfides and promote their gradual diffusion into the porous carbon membrane on the opposite side of the electrolyte. The unique triple-layer-structured multifunctional membrane is ideal as a Li-S battery electrode. The upper spongy-like pores realize physical confinement of polysulfides and sulfur loading; the hierarchical macropores can accommodate volume strain and provide reservoirs for the opposite diffusion of polysulfides; and the dense conductive lower layer can replace Al foil as a current collector. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic effect of FexC on promoting polysulfide conversion and accelerating redox reaction kinetics ensures a smooth trapping-diffusion-conversion mechanism, which greatly suppresses the shuttle effect. The opposite diffusion and catalytic conversion of this flexible membrane is expected to have significant potential for large-scale production in practical applications.

Benefiting from the unique pure sulfur electrode and an upper current collector design, the pure sulfur electrode displays low polarization, high sulfur utilization, and promising cycling stability even with an ultrahigh sulfur loading. A high areal capacity of 19.2 mAh cm(-2) has been achieved, which is the highest areal capacity for the reported blade-cast sulfur electrodes and 4 times higher than that of available lithium-ion battery electrodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of large-sized sulfur particles only slightly decreases the rate of conversion from S-8 to S-4(2-) during the initial discharge and has negligible impact on subsequent electrochemical performance.

However, the cyclic stability of the Li2S-based Li-S battery is seriously prevented by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Meanwhile, due to the poor electrical conductivity of Li2S, the Li-S battery displays slow reaction kinetics. In this work, we design 3D-porous carbon (PC) architecture as a host for inhabiting the LiPS shuttle based on physical capture. Furthermore, this porous carbon architecture is modified by introducing two kinds of heteroatoms (N and S) to form dual active sites (named as NSPC) for chemically binding LiPSs and accelerating their conversion. The polyvinyl pyrrolidone-coated Li2SO4 center dot H2O is embedded in the NSPC skeleton and further forms the Li2S/NSPC cathode via a carbothermal reduction process. In consequence, the NSPC architecture possesses continuous electron/ion channels and abundant active sites, which are beneficial to the fast diffusion of Li+ and timely conversion of sulfur species. As a result, the as-prepared Li2S/NSPC cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 690 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 1C and keeps a capacity of 587 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles with a good capacity retention rate of 85% and low fading rate of 0.075% per cycle. Therefore, this work offers a brand-new platform to understand the synergistic effects of promoting reaction kinetics for Li2S-based Li-S batteries.

The synthesized ionic liquid-derived carbon is hierarchically structured with pore size maxima around 6 nm and 750 nm, and it has a room temperature electrical conductivity of 78 S cm(1), owing to a high content of pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen. Further, this carbon can accommodate up to similar to 80% sulfur by weight, and the resulting nanocomposite demonstrates promising performance as novel electrode material for LiS batteries. Cathodes with low areal mass loading (1 mg(sulfur) cm(2)) can be cycled at C/5 and 1C over several hundreds of cycles with low polarization and very little capacity fading (4% between the fifth and 1000th cycles at 1C). Highly loaded cathodes (4 mg(sulfur) cm(2)) also exhibit good cyclability at C/5 with areal capacities of 2.6 mAh cm(2) on average over 200 cycles. Yet the high capacities make the cells more prone to electrolyte decomposition, which eventually gives rise to low round trip energy efficiencies depending on the electrolyte-to-sulfur mass ratio. Results from in operando X-ray diffraction show that nanocrystalline Li2S forms midway through the second discharge plateau, and sulfur recrystallizes in the metastable beta-S-8 phase, with 30 to 40 nm crystallites, but undergoes amorphization under open circuit conditions. Overall, this work represents a step forward in the development of durable high-energy LiS batteries and provides valuable insights into the operation of such cells.

However, strategies for the construction of 3D graphene sponges composited with sulfur nanoparticles (3DGS) are either energy consuming or involve toxic reagents. Herein, a 3DGS is fabricated via a reduction induced self-assembly method, which is simple but facile and scalable. The structural design of this 3DGS promises fast Li+ transport, superior electrolyte absorbability and effective electro-chemical redox reactions of sulfur. As a result, this 3DGS achieves a stable capacity of 580 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at a high rate of 1.5 A g(-1), which corresponds to a low fading rate of 0.043% per cycle. The present study effectively demonstrates that the 3D construction strategy is propitious for obtaining flexible high performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, we report a new type of reactive molecule-based LPS trapper, zinc acetate-diethanol-amine (Zn(OAc)(2)center dot DEA), which demonstrates a molecular efficiency of 1.8 for LPS trapping, approaching its theoretical limit of 2, which is the highest trapping capability reported so far. Furthermore, the catalytic effect of Zn2+center dot DEA on the redox of sulfur species promotes the thermodynamics for the reduction of trapped LPS and decreases the energy barrier for the oxidation of Zn(SLi)(2)center dot DEA formed in the discharging process. LSBs using Zn(OAc)(2)center dot DEA as the LPS trapper, binder, and redox catalyst exhibited excellent long-term cycling stability (with a capacity retention of 85% after 1000 cycles at a rate of 0.5C) and enhanced rate performance.

J	Wu, JB; Wang, LW				Wu, Jianbao; Wang, Lin-Wang			2D framework C2N as a potential cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries: an ab initio density functional study	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							NITROGEN-DOPED GRAPHENE; CYCLE-LIFE; PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDES; COMPOSITE; ELECTROLYTES; ELECTRODES; MECHANISM; SURFACE	One of the biggest challenges of Li-S batteries (LSBs) is the dissolution of polysulfides at the cathode side. An ideal LSB cathode should be able to prevent polysulfide (Li2Sn, 1 <= n <= 8) dissolution, and should have a strong binding energy, high capacity and a light weight, as well as being electrically conductive. Herein, we present our quantum chemical calculations combined with a genetic algorithm for a global structure search using a C2N nanosheet as a LSB cathode. The Gibbs free energies of isolated Li2Sn and LimSn_C2N (1 <= m, 1 <= n <= 8) are calculated to set forth the studies of both the voltages and stabilities of lithiation reactions in every step of the discharging process. Our results indicate that the polysulfides can adhere to the C2N host substrate in a thermodynamically stable cluster state without dissolution, and the system has an energy capacity of up to 1122.21 W h k g(-1). The calculated band-structure shows that LimSn_C2N is metallic though the original C2N nanosheet has an optical gap of 1.96 eV. This shows that C2N could be a promising cathode material for LSBs.

Metallic lithium is considered a core anode material in high energy density rechargeable batteries because of its high theoretical specific energy density, the lowest redox potential, and high mechanical flexibility. However, safety issues and a short cycle life induced by lithium dendrites restrict the practical uses of lithium metal batteries. Here we described a nitrogen. doped graphene/lithium metal composite as an anode, in which the Li metal nucleation and growth was guided by doped heteroatoms in the graphene framework. Dendrite. free plating/stripping behavior was detected on the composite anode and its use in flexible lithium. sulfur batteries was validated.

Morphologically similar but chemically different materials are used to study the influence of heteroatoms in Li-S batteries. The materials show capacities as high as 1290 mAhg(-1) in the first cycle using 50 wt% S loading. Heteroatom doping reduces the capacity fading and the polarization throughout cycling. Zeta potential measurements reveal positive surface charges for heteroatom-doped carbons and indicate attractive interactions with polysulfides causing reduced fading. A polysulfide-selective sorption study reveals strongly different adsorption behavior depending on the carbon's chemical composition. Interestingly, the polysulfide fraction is also crucial. The results indicate that improved adsorption of long-chain polysulfides to doped carbons is related to improved capacity retention.

Further treatment using a HNO3 and H2O2 solution at 80 degrees C resulted in a hierarchical pore structure of micro- and meso-pores in the carbon material with a high surface area of 1037.52 m(2)/g. Nitrogen, a rich heteroatom in raw SCG, is self-incorporated well in the carbon skeleton of the resultant porous carbon with a high nitrogen content of 3 w/w%. The prepared hierarchical porous carbon was tested as a material for Li-S batteries, and displayed a capacity of more than 600 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C up to 150 cycles. As a sustainable carbon material, the SCG derived porous carbon, which has abundant heteroatoms of O and N, can be employed as a potential energy storage material.

Additionally, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy also reveals a lower electrode resistance and better kinetic characteristics with Alg-Ca2+ as a binder. The improved electrochemical behaviors are assigned to the ability of maintaining the electrode stability due to the excellent mechanical property and amorphous structure. [GRAPHICS] .

In this work, a multi-function electrocatalyst of cobalt oxyhydroxide decorating homogeneous porous hollow carbon sphere (CoOOH-PHCS) was designed and fabricated. The CoOOH-PHCS can not only be used as an electrocatalyst to inhibit the shuttle effect in Li-S batteries (LSBs), but also can effectively accelerate the reaction kinetics in oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the CoOOH-PHCS. Benefiting from the synergy effect of CoOOH and PHCS, the CoOOH-HPC/S electrode exhibits a low capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle in 450 cycles at 1C. Meanwhile, the CoOOH-PHCS demonstrates excellent OER and ORR activity in the alkaline electrolyte. This work explores and reveals the application potential of CoOOH in electrocatalytic field.

Herein, the correlation between Li plating behavior and the surface characteristics of electrospun porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) is systemically elucidated through experiments and theoretical calculations. It is revealed that the neat carbon surface suffers from severe lattice mismatch with Li metal, hindering uniform Li plating. In contrast, open pores created on the PCNF surface serve as active sites for controlled initial nucleation of Li. The introduction of oxygenated functional groups further facilitates the nucleation of Li on PCNFs through the largely reduced nucleation energy barrier. The Li film uniformly deposited on PCNFs enables efficient use of the whole carbon surface, giving rise to enhanced cyclic stability of the electrode. When used as an anode in lithium-sulfur batteries, the modified electrode delivers an excellent energy density of 385 Wh kg(-1) after 100 cycles. The fundamental correlation established in this study is universal to all types of carbonaceous materials and sheds new light on the rational design of high-performance Li metal anodes by controlling the initial Li nucleation.

The composite was characterized by TGA, X-ray diffraction, FTIR, Raman, SEM, TEM, and BET studies. The composite exhibited a high discharge capacity of 1330 mAh/g in the first cycle. The AB additive plays multiple roles in the composite, acting as a conducting matrix for electron transport and as a porous framework that adsorbs and retains electrolyte. The presence of PAN along with the porous carbon matrix in the composite provides the necessary resilience to absorb strains due to volume expansion during cycling. The observed improved performance of the composite is primarily attributed to the small size and homogeneous distribution of sulfur in the composite. (c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Porous Fe3O4 Nanospheres as Effective Sulfur Hosts for Li-S Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ENRICHED MESOPOROUS CARBONS; RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM; ACTIVATED CARBON; POLYSULFIDE MEDIATOR; HOLLOW SPHERES; ENERGY DENSITY; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; NANOPARTICLES; NANOTUBES	Lithium-sulfur batteries are considered to be one of the most promising candidates for next-generation "beyond lithium-ion" energystorage systems. However, the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries has been hindered by fast capacity fade caused by polysulfide shuttling problems, as well as by a limited volumetric energy density due to low sulfur loading. Here, porous Fe3O4 nanospheres have been employed as a sulfur host to address the polysulfide shuttling problem through chemical interactions. We have employed optical microscopy and cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM) with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS) elemental mapping to study the inherent microstructure of an Fe3O4/S composite with 85% sulfur content. We observe well-faceted, micrometer-sized sulfur particles embedded in a network of the conductive Fe3O4 nanosphere host particles. Our Fe3O4/S composite shows high capacity and outstanding cycling stability. The initial areal capacity is 2.6 mAh cm(-2) and a high areal capacity of 2.2 mAh cm(-2) was retained after 150 cycles. We believe that both the embedding of sulfur, in a conductive Fe3O4 network, and the strong chemical interactions between Fe3O4 and polysulfides are responsible for the high capacity and high cycling stability of our Fe3O4 composite cathode.

However, the further development of Li-S battery is still retarded by the lack of complete mechanistic understanding of the sulfur redox process. Herein we introduce a conductive Lewis base matrix which has the ability to enhance the battery performance of Li-S battery, via the understanding of the complicated sulfur redox chemistry on the electrolyte/carbon interface by a combined in operand Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) method. The higher polysulfides, Li2S8, is found to be missing during the whole redox route, whereas the charging process of Li-S battery is ended up with the Li2S6. DFT calculations reveal that Li2S8 accepts electrons more readily than S-8 and Li2S6 so that it is thermodynamically and kinetically unstable. Meanwhile, the poor adsorption behavior of Li2Sn on carbon surface further prevents the oxidization of Li2Sn back to S-8 upon charging. Periodic DFT calculations show that the N-doped carbon surface can serve as conductive Lewis base "catalyst" matrix to enhance the adsorption energy of Li2S (n = 4-8). This approach allows the higher Li2Sn to be further oxidized into S-8, which is also confirmed by in operando Raman spectroscopy. By recovering the missing link of Li2S8 in the whole redox route, a significant improvement of the S utilization and cycle stability even at a high sulfur loading (70%, m/m) in the composite on a simple super P carbon.

However, it is still challenging to design appropriate sulfur hosts for advanced S cathodes in LSBs. Herein, we first devised an even milder and industrialized methodology for high-yield synthesis of high-content (similar to 3.8 at%) N-doped graphene nanoribbons (N-GNRs) in situ loaded with nano-dimensional metal compounds (Co or Co/CoOOH) by chemically unzipping N-doped carbon nanotubes using HNO3 or KOH for LSBs as advanced encapsulation matrices for sulfur. KOH/HNO3-involved unzipping mechanisms are reasonably put forward along with optimized unzipping parameters. Systematic physicochemical and electrochemical analyses reveal that the product obtained by using 10 M KOH as the unzipping agent, i.e., K-N-GNRs@Co/CoOOH, is the most efficient encapsulation host for high-performance sulfur cathodes in LSBs, benefiting from its appealing merits including high catalytic activity, superb electronic conductivity and exceptional physical/chemical adsorption. Encouragingly, the S/K-N-GNRs@Co/CoOOH cathode (similar to 73.7 wt% S loading) yields excellent long-duration cyclic performance and rate capabilities, even with high areal S loading (similar to 3.9 mg cm(-2)). More significantly, this work provides a smart integration of metal compounds with N-GNRs via a scalable synthetic strategy for next-generation LSBs as promising hosts.

Constructing a continuous pore structure of the sulfur electrode that enables facile lithium ion transport into the electrode and mitigates the reconstruction of sulfur is a key factor for enhancing the electrochemical performance. Here, we report a three-dimensionally (3D) aligned sulfur electrode cast onto conventional aluminum foil by directional freeze tape casting. The 3D aligned sulfur-graphene oxide (S-GO) electrode consisting of few micron thick S-GO layers with 10-20 mu m interlayer spacings demonstrates significant improvement in the performance of the Li/S cell. Moreover, the freeze tape cast graphene oxide electrode exhibits homogeneous reconfiguration behavior in the polysulfide catholyte cell tests and demonstrated extended cycling capability with only 4% decay of the specific capacity over 200 cycles. This work emphasizes the critical importance of proper structural design for sulfur-carbonaceous composite electrodes.

Encouraging progress has been made from the perspective of electrocatalysis with various metal oxides (sulfides) or organic compounds as catalysts. Also, the identification of the active site as well as the continuous regulation of electronic structure is quite urgent for a rational design of a catalyst. Here, the LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) ternary cathode material is used to obtain transition-metal ions of different chemical states by different delithiation states for the discussion on catalyst design strategy. On this basis, NCM523 with a special electronic structure of the delithiation state at 3.8 V can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect through physical restriction and chemical affinity. Moreover, Ni3+ shows high activity to accelerate the redox reaction of the captured LiPSs. In this light, LSBs with an NCM-3.8 V layer coating on a commercial polypropylene separator can deliver excellent electrochemical performance. A minute capacity decay rate of 0.089% per cycle can be obtained at 1C after 300 cycles. This study proposed a creative method to design the electronic structure, and simultaneously a strategy, to build active sites. The strategy not only provides a new idea for the realization of high-performance LSBs but also gives a blueprint to design a catalyst with high catalytic activity in the future.

This structure could efficiently inhibit the polysulfide dissolution and improve the conductivity at the same time. As a result, the cycle performance of Li-S battery was greatly improved due to the presence of core-shell MnO2/S composite. The results show that the specific capacity of core-shell MnO2/S composite is 1200 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C.

Glassy carbon cathodes are employed to build and validate the proposed transmission line model, which is later on employed to investigate the effect of various parameters of Li2S deposit (coverage, thickness, porosity) on cell's impedance. Among others, the model is applied to study the effect of discharge and self-discharge. Finally, the simplified planar cathode is exchanged with a more conventional mesoporous carbon cathode to determine the effect of Li2S deposition on the impedance of a commercially viable cell design. We have found that Li2S deposit has little effect on the impedance response, owing to its porous structure. The most noticeable change stemming from the process of Li2S deposition is due to the depletion of polysulfide species concentration in the electrolyte, which decreases the chemical capacitance and increases the tail height in the low frequency region of the impedance spectra.

Here, we report on the preparation and characterization of nanoporous Li2S and multiwalled (MW) carbon nanotube (CNT) - linked Li2S powders, prepared for the first time via a versatile solution-based method. The addition of MWCNTs enhances electrical conductivity and structural stability of the Li2S-based cathodes and reduces polarization of cells operating at high current densities. The nanostructured Li2S-based cathodes containing 20wt% MWCNT showed promising discharge capacities of up to similar to 1050mA h g(S)(-1) at a slow rate of C/20 and similar to 800 mA h g(S)(-1) at a C/2 rate. Quite remarkably, without any electrolyte additives (such as polysulfides or lithium nitrate) MWCNT-linked Li2S cathodes demonstrated up to similar to 90% capacity retention after 100 cycles in half cells (vs. Li foil) at a C/5 and C/10 rates.

All electrodes had a high sulfur, loading similar to 4.0 mg per cm(2). The coincells were characterized by EIS and tested by constant current cycling and cyclic voltammetry using a standard electrolytic solution of LiTFSI in an ether mixture with LiNO3 as additive. The cycled sulfur electrodes were characterized by post-mortem SEM and N-2-sorption and compared to the pristine states. LiPAA-based cells showed the highest reproducibility of the electrochemical performances, the most limited specific capacity fading (at least twice smaller), and the better rate capability compared to PVDF- and PEO-based cells. The electrochemical data agreed with the post-mortem analyses of the different electrodes. The pristine electrodes showed similar morphologies and porosities independent of the polymeric binder used. Dramatic changes were observed for the PEO- and PVDF-based sulfur electrodes, in which a new dense morphology appeared after two and thirty cycles, respectively. Both PEO- and PVDF-based cycled electrodes were prone to delaminate from the current collector. In comparison, the morphology of the LiPAA-based sulfur electrodes remained mostly unchanged even after thirty cycles and no delamination behavior could be observed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results demonstrate a clear correlation between the size of sulfur confinement and the resulting Li-S electrochemical mechanisms. In particular, when sulfur is confined within sub-nano pores, we observe identical lithium-sulfur electrochemical behavior, which is distinctly different from conventional Li-S reactions, in both ether and carbonate electrolytes. Taken together, our results highlight the critical importance of sub-nano confinement effects on controlling solid-state reactions in Li-S electrochemical systems.

In this work, the anchoring effects of 2H-MoS2 and 1T'-MoS2 monolayers for Li-S batteries were investigated by using density functional theory calculations. It was found that the binding energies of Li2Sx absorbed on 1T'-MoS2 monolayer are in the range of 0.31-2.94 eV, which is much higher than on the 2H-phase. The 1T'-MoS2 monolayer shows stronger trapping ability for Li2Sx than the 2H-MoS2 monolayer. The 1T'-MoS2 monolayer can be used as effective anchoring material in cathodes for Li-S batteries.

J	He, JR; Chen, YF; Manthiram, A				He, Jiarui; Chen, Yuanfu; Manthiram, Arumugam			Vertical Co9S8 hollow nanowall arrays grown on a Celgard separator as a multifunctional polysulfide barrier for high-performance Li-S batteries	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; HIGH-AREAL-CAPACITY; FREESTANDING CATHODE; GRAPHENE OXIDE; LONG-LIFE; INTERLAYER; NANOTUBES; ELECTRODE; MEMBRANE	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been regarded as one of the most promising next-generation energy-storage devices, due to their low cost and high theoretical energy density (2600 W h kg(-1)). However, the severe dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the fatal shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode seriously hinder the practical applications of Li-S batteries. To address such issues, we present here, for the first time, a novel metal organic framework (MOF)-derived Co9S8 nanowall array with vertical hollow nanoarchitecture and high electrical conductivity, which is grown in situ on a Celgard separator (Co9S8-Celgard) via a feasible and scalable liquid-reaction approach, as an efficient barrier for LiPSs in Li-S batteries. Benefiting from the direct in situ growth of vertical Co9S8 hollow nanowall arrays as a multifunctional polar barrier, the Co9S8-Celgard separator possesses large surface area, excellent mechanical stability, and particularly strong LiPS-trapping ability via chemical and physical interactions. With these advantages, even with a pure sulfur cathode with a high sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm(-2), the Li-S cells with the Co9S8-Celgard separator exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance: the initial specific capacity is as high as 1385 mA h g(-1) with a retention of 1190 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. The cells deliver a high capacity of 530 mA h g(-1) at a 1C rate (1675 mA g(-1)) even after an impressive number of 1000 cycles with an average capacity fade of only 0.039% per cycle, which is promising for long-term cycling application at high charge/discharge current densities, and pouch-type Li-S cells with the Co9S8-Celgard separator display excellent cycling performance. When the optimized cathode with the sulfur loading in well-designed yolk-shelled carbon@Fe3O4 (YSC@Fe3O4) nanoboxes is employed, the cell with Co9S8-Celgard delivers a high initial capacity of 986 mA h g(-1) at a 1C rate with a capacity retention as high as 83.2% even after a remarkable number of 1500 cycles. This work presents a strategy to grow on the separator a multifunctional polar interlayer with unique nanoarchitecture and high conductivity to chemically and physically trap the LiPSs, thus significantly enhancing the performance of Li-S batteries.

X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the crystalline structure of the pristine Li2S was basically preserved upon both coating processes. The dry coating process (Li2S-C-sucrose) resulted in Li2S particles covered only partially by smaller carbon particles, whereas the wet coating method (Li2S-C-PAN) gave Li2S particles, homogenously decorated with thin carbon flakes. As a result, the cycling performance of Li2S-C based electrodes was significantly improved, particularly for Li2S-C-PAN, for which a coulombic efficiency of more than 99.5% was obtained.

Oxygen-containing functional groups (such as C-O-H, C-O-C and C=O) can effectively relieve a large amount of polysulfide dissolution due to their strong polarity. However, their types and contents on polysulfide-capturing abilities are still unknown. Therefore, three kinds of electrodes containing different contents of hydroxyl (C-O-H), ether (C-O-C) and carbonyl (C=O) groups on carbon surface are controlled by changing pyrolysis times of dandelion. Electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries is tested to analyze influence of these groups on polysulfide-capturing abilities. It is discovered that C=O and C-O-H groups can obviously inhibit shuttle effects of polysulfides during their initial production. In addition, a large number of C=O bonds are converted to C-O-H bonds. More C-O-H bonds facilitate reversible capture of polysulfides and improve capacities. The introduction of C-O-C groups is not suitable for capturing more polysulfides rapidly and the appearance of ether groups limits conversion process of C-O-H groups. Both S load and discharging/charging process can effectively regulate evolution of three valence bonds, which is conducive to improving rate performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Therefore, much effort has been made to synthesize and tailor the microstructures of porous carbon materials via various activation procedures (physical and chemical activation). In particular, the chemical activation of various carbon sources using KOH as the activating reagent is very promising because of its lower activation temperature and higher yields, and well-defined micropore size distribution and ultrahigh specific surface area up to 3000 m(2) g(-1) of the resulting porous carbons. In this feature article, we will cover recent research progress since 2007 on the synthesis of KOH-activated carbons for hydrogen and electrical energy storage (supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur batteries). The textural properties and surface chemistry of KOH-activated carbons depend on not only the synthesis parameters, but also different carbon sources employed including fossil/biomass-derived materials, synthetic organic polymers, and various nanostructured carbons (e.g. carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon aerogels, carbide-derived carbons, graphene, etc.). Following the introduction to KOH activation mechanisms and processing technologies, the characteristics and performance of KOH-activated carbons as well as their relationships are summarized and discussed through the extensive analysis of the literature based on different energy storage systems.

But the polysulfide dissolution and intrinsic insulation of sulfur cause problems such as poor rate performance, low coulombic efficiency and short cycle life. To build both high rate and long life sulfur cathodes, we combine nanosized sulfur crystals and Li+/electron conductive black phosphorus (BP) with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-BP/S) through two-step deposition process. Nanosized sulfur crystals could shorten Li+/electron transport routes and the cross-linked MWCNTs skeleton supports stable and super conductivity of whole cathodes. What's more, the Li+ diffusion and reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes are greatly promoted by BP nanoparticles due to its good electronic conductivity and high Li+ diffusion constant. Meanwhile, the polysulfide diffusion is effectively restrained through chemisorption of P-S bonds. As a result, the MWCNTs-BP/S cathode with 70 wt% sulfur exhibits a stable working state over 1000 cycles at 1 C with a fading rate as low as 0.053%. Even at an ultrahigh rate of 8 C, the specific capacity still remain 505 mA h g(-1). Our research proves that applying polysulfide adsorbents with both good Li+/electronic conductivity is effective for improving reaction kinetics. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

In this study, we developed a novel and scalable method to synthesize well-defined HCSs. The HCSs were prepared using a pyrolytic soft template of styrene/acrylic acid copolymer microspheres. Sulfur could be effectively confined inside the pores of the uniform-sized HCSs (average diameter = 320 nm, shell thickness = 40-50 nm) to produce a S/HCS-65-IM (S content = 65 wt%) Li-S cathode using a modified sulfur-loading method involving solution impregnation followed by melt-diffusion (IM). S/HCS-65-IM delivered much higher capacity and greater cycling stability over 200 cycles and showed much lower impedance build up than S/HCS-65-PM prepared via the conventional melt-diffusion of a physical mixture of sulfur powder and HCSs. The sulfur utilization of S/HCS-65-IM was further improved by more than 20% by suppressing its lithium-polysulfide shuttle effect using a carbon-coated separator (CCS). The S/HCS-65-IM cathode (with CCS) also exhibited excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of >81% after 200 cycles at 0.5 C) and high rate capability with a reduced interfacial charge transfer resistance, suggesting that S/HCS-65-IM (with CCS) is a promising cathode for Li-S batteries.

The key features of NPAC materials are the micro-/mesopore coexistent structure and ultrahigh surface area (2307 m(2) g(-1)), which displays the significance of carbon synthesis from biochars. When NPAC serves as the sulfur holder, it not only benefits the maximum encapsulation of sulfur in the pores but also restrains the dissolution of polysulfides through physisorption. Meanwhile, the N and P co-doping is favorable for binding polysulfides by providing additional chemical adsorption sites via bonding with polysulfides. Relying on the synergistic effect of physi-/chemisorption, the sulfur-infiltrated NPAC material (NPAC-S) shows superior electrochemical performance to AC-S. After 300 cycles at a high current density of 1 C, the NPAC-S72 composite indicates a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g(-1) with the capacity decay of 0.103% per cycle after 300 cycles. This work demonstrates that the biomass-derived carbon route promises due to the unexpected textures of the as-obtained carbon materials inherently from the special biological structures. The NPAC also shows a promising prospect in the application of absorbents, electrochemical catalysts, and capacitor materials, which inspires researcher to explore other new functional carbonaceous materials.

The as-prepared HPBC material possesses high surface area up to 949.85 m(2) g(-1) and high pore volume of 3.14 cm(3) g(-1). Cathodes with sulfur content of 81.29 wt% for Li-S batteries were prepared using the HPBC as a conductive matrix and a certain amount of space was preserved to accommodate the volume change during lithiation. When evaluated for electrochemical properties, the uniform pore structure of the HPBC afforded superior cyclability and rate performance for the Li-S batteries. An initial capacity of 922 mA h g(-1) and a reversible capacity of 683 mA h g(-1) were delivered after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C. Specifically, a reversible capacity of 483 mA h g(-1) was retained over 300 cycles at a current density of 1 C.

Defect engineering with plentiful active sites and high surface binding energies to restrain polysulfides dissolution and promote the redox conversion polysulfides. Here, we present a nano carbon intercalated by W18O49 nanorods composite materials as functional sulfur host. With high W/O ratio of 0.367 in tungsten oxide famliy (WOx), W18O49 achieves abundant oxygen vacancy in intrinsic atomic structure. These oxygen vacancies not only provide stable active sites to stabilize the Li2S but also immobilize polysulfides by strong coulombic interactions of W-S and Li-O bondings. Accordingly, this cathode achieves stable long cycling performance with decay rate of 0.038 % per cycle at 2 C for 1200 cycles. With high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg.cm(-2), the cathode also shows stable cycling at 0.2 C for 150 cycles. This immobilizations of polysulfides by oxygen vacancy engineering in W18O49 is referential for developing commercial useable Li-S batteries.

The main challenge in developing long-life and high-power Li-S batteries is simultaneously suppressing the shuttle effect and reinforcing the reaction kinetics. In this work, we have designed novel nickel phosphide (Ni2P) yolk-shell nanosphere encapsulated sulfur (S@Ni2P-YS) for lithium-sulfur batteries with high power character. Conductive polar Ni2P has been shown to integrate the adsorption site and the electrochemical active site of polysulfides, which has been proven to increase the intrinsic activity toward in situ electrochemical reaction during the reaction process compared to semiconducting nickel oxides. Consequently, S@Ni2P-YS exhibits an enhanced performance of 1409 mA h g(-1) initially at 0.2C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)) and 439 mA h g(-1) at 10C. Meanwhile, high cycle life has been achieved (645 mA h g(-1) initially and 394 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5C) attributed to the high chemical adsorption ability. This class of conductive Ni2P composite and its electrochemical behavior could provide novel insights for high-energy batteries.

However, the binding ability between highly polar titanium dioxide and weakly polar biomass carbon is weak. The sulfur-loading capacity of titanium dioxide/biomass carbon composite structures is limited and a large number of polysulfides produce shuttle effects. How to enhance the binding ability of titanium dioxide and biomass carbon to achieve high sulfur-loading is an issue that needed to be solved. In this paper, we introduce cobalt into the surface of titanium dioxide/biomass carbon composite structures, adjust the cobalt-titanium molar ratio and obtain composite structures with the strongest binding abilities. The composite structure has high specific capacity and good cycling stability. After 500 cycles at 1.7 A g(-1), the reversible capacity is still close to 400 mA h g(-1). The high capacity and good cycling stability depend on the ability of composite structures to capture multiple polysulfides and achieve reversible conversion.

The pros and cons of this method are still unclear in relation to lithium-sulfur battery applications. Here, the influences of two synthetic routes, a melt-diffusion method and H+ reacting with S-EDA via nucleophilic substitution, on the morphologies and electrochemical properties of cathode materials are discussed in detail based on in situ XRD and other advanced technologies. Accordingly, high S-loading is achieved when H+ reacts with S-EDA via ion exchange on the surface of acetylene black, and capacities of 693.8, 644.5, and 638.9 mA h g(-1) are obtained over the first three cycles when the C/S composite is used as a cathode in coin cells without the conductive additive Super P. In situ XRD data confirm that poor electrochemical properties can mainly be attributed to the conversion rate of S species being too rapid to thoroughly utilize the S molecules that are immobilized, which means that more fixed sulfur can form during the charge/discharge process when using the ion-exchange method to make the C/S composite. In addition, a long-chain polysulfide shuttling effect is directly noticed via AFM in tapping-KPFM mode in the C/S composite that was synthesized via the melt-diffusion method, even though polar S-O bonds exist in the composite. The increase in the cathodic surface potential from 102.8 to 141.1 mV and the increase in the morphological height from 547.7 to 829.7 nm during the discharge/charge process can be attributed to the process of S loss.

Investigation of non-woven carbon paper as a current collector for sulfur positive electrode-Understanding of the mechanism and potential applications for Li/S batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						lithium/sulfur batteries; 3D current collector; non-woven carbon paper; high sulfur loading; improved electronic and ionic pathways	ENERGY-STORAGE; HIGH-CAPACITY; FIBER CLOTH; IN-SITU; LITHIUM; BINDER; CATHODE; CHALLENGES	Porous 3-D current collectors have been shown to be the primary choice in replacing classical 2D aluminum foil in applicable developments, especially those using carbon-based current collectors. In this study, we investigated the impact of using a non-woven carbon (NWC) based current collector for sulfur electrodes, in terms of performance and practical use in a commercial battery, keeping in mind the simplicity of electrode preparation method. The benefits of using NWC as a 3D current collector include high sulfur utilization for even highly loaded electrodes, lower polarization, and the provision of an efficient electrolyte reservoir. High discharge capacities up to similar to 1200 mAh g (1) can be obtained at moderate C-rates, with relatively good capacity retention (<1% loss per cycle) and practical loadings as high as 8 mAh cm(-2).

Novel design and mechanisms to encapsulate LiPSs are greatly desired by high-performance LSBs towards practical applications. Herein, we report a strategy of preparing Lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO) nanofibers using bacterial cellulose as excellent biomimetic mineralization template at room temperature. Natural abundant organic molecule of Anthraquinone (AQ) combine with the zero strain fast ionic conductor of LTO can inhibit the dissolution and diffusion of LiPSs through redox reactions during cycling. The keto groups (C = 0) of AQ play a critical role in forming strong Lewis acid-based chemical bonding. The 3D interwove network structure of LTO nanofibers also hinders the shuttle effect of LiPSs. Polydopamine (PDA) coated on the outermost layer not only improves the conductivity of the whole electrode, but also enhances the wettability of the electrolyte. The long-term stability of S-based electrode is ensured by the synergistic effect of the three. This mechanism leads to a long cycling stability of S-based electrodes. With a high sulfur content of similar to 70%, a low capacity decay of 0.042%, 0.063% and 0.061% per cycle for 500 cycles at the current densities of 1, 2 and 4C, respectively. The water-soluble binder was adopted, which was a solid step for the practical application of LSBs. This finding and understanding paves an alternative avenue for the future design of S-based cathodes toward the practical application of LSBs.

However, when facing with the practical application, some issues, especially poor electro-conductivity of element sulfur and severe polysulfides (LiPSs) migration, are still needed to solve to further improve the performance of the Li-S batteries. Aiming at the above two disadvantages, in this work, multifunctional separators are designed as efficient LiPSs absorber via coating vapor grown carbon fiber/MoS2 (VGCF/MoS2) composites on the polypropylene separator (PP) near the cathode side. For the as-prepared VGCF/MoS(2 )coated polypropylene separator (VM/PP), MoS2 could provide strong chemical adsorption for the LiPSs, while the VGCF framework could act as an electronic transmission channel for the conversion of LiPSs, and also provide physical adsorption for LiPSs at the same time. Benefit from these characteristics, the batteries with VM/PP exhibits a high initial capacity of 1208.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and maintains at 862.4 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. Impressively, the VM/PP shows the high specific capacity of 904.3 mAh g(-1) and long-lasting cycling stability with 0.03% capacity attenuation per cycle over 600 cycles at 1.0C, demonstrating excellent electrochemical performance.

First of all, the gamma-MnS@KB (MKB) composite powders were prepared via a solvothermal reaction, then a spray drying method was used to obtain GO@MKB-S composites, which displays core/shell nanostructure. SEM, TEM, XRD as well as Raman spectrum are implemented to look into the microstructures and the functions of the 2D nanosheet-like gamma-MnS in setting in KB on the battery performance were carefully analyzed. It is demonstrated that electrochemical discharge capacity and rate performance are clearly improved by using GO@MKB-S composites compared to the cathode electrode of the GO coated KB-S (GO@KB-S). With a sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2), the cathode electrode of GO@MKB-S shows a considerable discharge capacity of 749.9 mAh g(-1)at 0.36 C. Additionally, the Li-S battery cycle retention of GO@MKB-S sample maintains 97.36% after 100 cycles and 78.69% after 200 cycles.

The key challenge for lithium-chalcogen systems is to increase the chalcogen content in the system without sacrificing performance in order to compete with Li-ion batteries. Here we report a rationally designed hierarchical porous carbon (SPC) electrode architectures with maximum micro-, meso-and macro-level porosities as the conductive framework for the lithium-chalcogen batteries. The hierarchical electrode architectures enable high mass loading of the active cathode materials, encapsulation of both the small and long chain chalcogenide species, reduced SEI reaction, and efficient mass transport in the electrolyte. The ideal cathode architecture to allow a maximum conversion reaction mechanism is identified for stable cycling. Cell level calculations suggests that the hierarchical electrode architectures have the potential to increase the specific energy to more than 350 Wh kg(-1), much higher than what can be achieved using the materials and parameters reported in the literature.

However, the sluggish redox kinetics and severe polysulfide shuttle effect in elemental sulfur cathodes, along with uncontrollable dendrite propagation in lithium metal anodes, inevitably depress the electrochemical performance of LSBs and impede their practical implementation. Motivated by a unique hierarchical geometry, specific chemical affinity, and nitrogen-enriched collagen component of natural skin fibers (SFs), here we proposed an effective structural engineering strategy for crafting an SF-derived superhierarchical N-doped porous carbon framework in situ implanted with nickel/graphitic carbon nanocages as a dual-role host to simultaneously address the challenges faced on the sulfur cathode and lithium anode in LSBs. The experimental results and theoretical calculation disclose that the implanted Ni nanoparticles and highly graphitic sp(2) carbon nanocages together with doped N heteroatoms not only provide a synergetic trapping-catalytic-conversion effect for regulating soluble polysulfides with promoted redox kinetics in the cathode at both room and elevated (55 degrees C) temperatures but also yield Ni-enhanced lithiophilic N-heteroatom active sites in the host framework to control Li deposition and suppress Li dendrite growth in anodes. Combining the cathodic and anodic improvements further achieves a superb rate and cycling performance in full LSB cells with stable Coulombic efficiency, showing great potential in developing reliable LSBs.

The composition and structure of this class of cathodes are crucial to the electrochemical performance, achieved energy density and the stability of the cell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is employed to investigate and correlate the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries to the composition and microstructure of differently fabricated carbon/sulfur composite cathodes. A transmission line model is applied to identify different underlying electrochemical processes appearing in the impedance response of a range of porous carbon/sulfur cathodes. The integration of a lithium ring serving as a counter electrode coupled with advanced wiring has allowed an artifact-free recording of the cathode impedance at different states of charge with the aim to investigate the evolution of impedance during discharge/charge and the kinetics of charge transfer depending on the infiltration method and the utilized carbon host. It is shown that impedance response of this class of cathodes is highly diverse and the plausible underlying processes are discussed in details. To this end, quasi-solid-state and various polysulfide-based charge transfer mechanisms are identified and their time constants are reported.

The sulfur in the polymer reversible reacts with Li and produces Li2S. Performing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we investigated the discharge of SPAN. Li-ions were added to the sys-tem in the vicinity of the sulfur chain and the total charge of the system was modified during the simu-lation. We observed that polysulfides (PSs) are formed and dissolved during lithiation, the polymer motif affects the capturing of Li-ions from the solvent, and SPAN acts also as active material. Nitrogen atoms on SPAN indicate to capture the PSs dissolved, and the Li-S structure tends to grow on top of the nitrogen atoms. The stair-like configuration of SPAN contributes to improving the performance of the LiSBs, but also how the sulfur is attached to the backbone, e.g. interconnected in the same backbone, is a factor to change cyclability. Thus beyond the solvent, the SPAN motifs also affect the battery cycles. Additionally, sulfur structures contribute to not form long chains with both edges attached to the polymer as an inter-connected structure, but small disulfides or sulfur chains attached with only one edge connected to the polymer.

Herein, we design a lightweight and multifunctional multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT)/sulfur/lithiated sulfonated CNT (M/S/M-SO3Li) electrode as energy storage devices. Flexible CNT films ensure continuously electron/ion transmission and serve as LiPS shielding layer. Moreover, guided by DFT and experimental results, SO3 groups exert a vital adsorption effect toward sulfur species but not NH4+ groups. The SO3 groups can not only employ as LiPS immobilizer by Li-O bands between LiPS and SO3 but also serve as multifunctional electrocatalyst to propel LiPS conversion via generating thiosulfate and polythionate and Li2S decomposition by reducing reaction overpotential. As expected, M/S/M-SO3Li electrode exhibits prominent rate capability (723.5 mAh g(-1) at 5 C), high sulfur loading (7.09 mAh cm(-2) at 5.0 mg cm(-2) sulfur), favorable anti-self-discharge capabilities (rest for 72 h at 0.5 C with 2.17%).

The cell exhibits superior performances compared with a control cell with a sulfur-containing cathode, as all sulfur on the separator takes part in the electrochemical reactions. We reveal that all electrically isolated sulfur from the carbon cathode is successfully converted to polysulfides via the electrode reactions of sulfur molecules at the interface of the carbon surface and the electrolyte solution.

Herein, we propose a heteroatom doping method to optimize the electronic structure for enhancing the adsorption and catalytic activity of VN that is in situ embedded into a spongy N-doped conductive framework, thus obtaining a Co-VN/NC multifunctional catalyst as an ideal sulfur host. The synthesized composite has both the unique structural advantages and the synergistic effect of cobalt, VN, and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC), which not only improve the polysulfide anchoring of the sulfur cathode but also boost the kinetics of polysulfide conversion. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co doping could enrich the d orbit electrons of VN for elevating the d band center, which improves its interaction with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and accelerates the interfacial electron transfer, simultaneously. As a result, the batteries present a high initial discharge capacity of 1521 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, good rate performance, and excellent cycling performances (similar to 876 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C after 300 cycles and similar to 490 mA h g(-1) at 2 C after 1000 cycles, respectively), even with a high areal sulfur loading of 4.83 mg cm(-2) (similar to 4.70 mA h cm(-2) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles). This well-designed work provides a good strategy to develop effective polysulfide catalysis and further obtain high-performance host materials for Li-S batteries.

The porous morphology of SiO2 ensures electrolyte accessibility, while the mechanical robustness of graphene and the carbon fiber contributes to structural sturdiness and flexibility. The synergistic effect exerted by polar SiO2 together with conductive graphene and the carbon fiber helps to confine sulfur and intermediate polysulfides as well as providing abundant charge transfer paths. Benefiting from these merits, a coin cell fabricated based on the freestanding 3D-GCSS with an 8 mg cm(-2) sulfur content displayed a high capacity of 1462 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C, satisfactory rate performance and cycling stability. More importantly, a type of ultra-flexible soft-packaged cell was assembled utilizing the 3D-GCSS electrode. At a considerable sulfur loading of 20 mg cm(-2), the battery delivered an outstanding capacity of 2.15 A h, a gravimetric energy density of 371 W h kg(-1) (1055 W h kg(-1) based on the cathode) and a volumetric energy density of 582 W h l(-1).

As for the reason of the poor cycle stability, it is caused by the poor electronic conductivity, dissolution of the polysulfide and the volume change of the sulfur during the electrochemical cycles. To improve the cycle performance of the lithium-sulfur batteries, many strategies have been proposed and applied for the lithium-sulfur batteries, including designing suitable host materials, protecting lithium anode and modifying the electrolyte. In this paper, core-shell C3N4 spheres are prepared and used as the host materials for the sulfur. The as-prepared S@C3N4 composites could deal with three shortcomings at the same time. As a result, the capacity of S@C3N4 composites stabilizes at 726 mAh g(-1) with the capacity retention of 92% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C.

Lithium-metal batteries including lithium-sulfur and lithium-oxygen cells have much higher theoretical energy density than lithium-ion batteries. Reckoned as the ideal anode, however, Li has many challenges when directly used, especially its tendency to form dendrite. Under bending conditions, the Li-dendrite growth can be further aggravated due to bending-induced local plastic deformation and Li-filaments pulverization. Here, the Li-metal anodes are made bending tolerant by integrating Li into bendable scaffolds such as reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) films. In the composites, the bending stress is largely dissipated by the scaffolds. The scaffolds have increased available surface for homogeneous Li plating and minimize volume fluctuation of Li electrodes during cycling. Significantly improved cycling performance under bending conditions is achieved. With the bending-tolerant r-GO/Li-metal anode, bendable lithium-sulfur and lithium-oxygen batteries with long cycling stability are realized. A bendable integrated solar cell-battery system charged by light with stable output and a series connected bendable battery pack with higher voltage is also demonstrated. It is anticipated that this bending-tolerant anode can be combined with further electrolytes and cathodes to develop new bendable energy systems.

An all-purpose flexible electrode that can be used both in sulfur cathode and Li metal anode is reported, and its application in wearable and portable storage electronic devices is demonstrated. The flexible electrode consists of a bimetallic CoNi nanoparticle-embedded porous conductive scaffold with multiple Co/Ni-N active sites (CoNi@PNCFs). Both experimental and theoretical analysis show that, when used as the cathode, the CoNi and Co/Ni-N active sites implanted on the porous CoNi@PNCFs significantly promote chemical immobilization toward soluble lithium polysulfides and their rapid conversion into insoluble Li2S, and therefore effectively mitigates the polysulfide shuttling effect. Additionally, a 3D matrix constructed with porous carbonous skeleton and multiple active centers successfully induces homogenous Li growth, realizing a dendrite-free Li metal anode. A Li-S battery assembled with S/CoNi@PNCFs cathode and Li/CoNi@PNCFs anode exhibits a high reversible specific capacity of 785 mAh g(-1) and long cycle performance at 5 C (capacity fading rate of 0.016% over 1500 cycles).

The as-prepared MGC possesses sheet-like morphological characteristics with unique textural properties such as high specific surface area (2047 m(2)g(-1)), large pore volume (1.69 cc(3)g(-1)) and has excellent graphitic carbon structures. Studies were made in order to optimize the sulfur loading into MGC and to modify the polypropylene separator by coating with a thin layer of as-prepared MGC to attain enhanced electrochemical performance. The optimized sulfur loaded MGC/S-2 cathode with modified separator delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 1542 mAh g(-1)and retained a discharge capacity of 1016 mAh g(-1)after 50 cycles at 0.2 C rate, attributed to high surface area and porosity of MGC, which act as host as well as barrier film that inhibits the migration of dissolved polysulfide species to the anode during the redox process. Furthermore, the novel cell configuration with modified separator renders high sulfur loading up to 9.3 mg cm(-2)and the resulting cell delivered a high discharge capacity of 632 mAh g(-1)at 0.2 C rate even at 50th cycle.

J	Jayan, R; Islam, MM				Jayan, Rahul; Islam, Md Mahbubul			First-Principles Investigation of the Anchoring Behavior of Pristine and Defect-Engineered Tungsten Disulfide for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							HIGH-CAPACITY; HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; CATHODE MATERIAL; DOPED GRAPHENE; DENSITY; POLYSULFIDES; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; NITROGEN; MOS2; PHOSPHORENE	We used first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the adsorption behavior of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) on pristine, defective, and oxygen-doped tungsten disulfide (WS2). We elucidate strategies to activate the basal planes of WS2 by introducing substitutional dopants and quantify the LiPSs' absorption strength at the edge sites. The basal plane of pristine and monovacancy sites of WS2 is found to be inactive, but oxygen doping on the sulfur vacancy site of WS2 endows adequate adsorption strength to anchor LiPSs. The adsorption of polysulfides on the 50% WS2 edges also exhibits binding energies adequate to immobilize the higher-order polysulfides. The results directly corroborate the experimental observation of LiPSs' adsorption at the edge sites of pristine WS2. We explain that the adsorption of LiPSs is facilitated via charge transfer from the polysulfides to the WS2. The calculated density of states indicates that the LiPSs' adsorbed WS2 substrates exhibit semiconducting behavior with a slightly lower band gap compared to pristine WS2. Overall, our simulation results demonstrate that oxygen doping is an effective strategy to activate the basal plane of the WS2 nanosheet to effectively suppress LiPSs' migration for realizing Li-S batteries with improved performance.

Herein, we grafted the cation on SBA-15 surface to achieve the high efficiency polysulfide reservoir through electrostatic force and the derived Im-SBA-15/CNT hybrid could exhibit a promising application potential as a host material for sulfur cathode owing to the strong poly sulfide adsorption of Im-SBA-15 and the successful electron conduction of CNT. As a result, the Im-SBA15/CNT/S composite delivers a superior electrochemical performance. Even after 350 cycles, Im-SBA-15/ CNT/S cathode also could show a capacity of 682.3 mAh/gsulfur with no obvious capacity fading.

The ratio of PPy to PEG equaled 31.7:1 after polymerization, and the PEG served as a cation dopant in the polymerization and electrochemical reactions. Elemental analysis, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, and electrochemical methods were performed to measure the physicochemical properties of the composite. Elemental analysis demonstrated that the sulfur, PPy, PEG, A-CNT, and chloride content in the synthesized material was 64.6%, 22.1%, 0.7%, 12.1%, and 0.5%, respectively. The thickness of the polymer shell was about 15-25nm, and FTIR confirmed the successful PPy/PEG synthesis. The cathode exhibited a high initial specific capacity of 1355mAhg(-1), and a sulfur usage of 81.1%. The reversible capacity of 924mAhg(-1) was obtained after 100cycles, showing a remarkably improved cyclability compared to equivalent systems without PEG doping and without any coatings. PPy/PEG provided an effective electronically conductive network and a stable interface structure for the cathode. Rate performance of the PPy/PEG- S/A-CNT composite was more than double that of the unmodified S/A-CNTs. Remarkably, the battery could work at a very high current density of 8Ag(-1) and reached an initial capacity of 542mAhg(-1); it also retained a capacity of 480mAhg(-1) after 100cycles. The addition of PEG as a dopant in the PPy shell contributed to this prominent rate improvement. Lithium ions and electrons were available everywhere on the surfaces of the particles, and thus could greatly improve the electrochemical reaction; PEG is a well-known solvent for lithium salts and a very good lithium-ion catcher.

J	Muralidharan, N; Nallathamby, K				Muralidharan, Nagalakshmi; Nallathamby, Kalaiselvi			In-situ Formed Polar Fe2N/MCMB Hybrid Interlayer for High-Rate Li-S Batteries	ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							DOPED GRAPHENE; CARBON; CATALYST; CATHODE; HOST	Owing to its high theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g(-1)) and high theoretical energy density (2600 W h kg(-1)), lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries receive intense attention as an alternate to current lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Sulfur, a surplus byproduct from petroleum industry along with an earth-abundant nature, ensures the low-cost production of Li-S batteries compared to LIBs. However, the common technical hurdles associated with sulfur such as low conductivity and poor cyclability due to the polysulfide shuttling effect hinder the realistic applications. In the current work, cashewnut sheath-derived biocarbon (CNS) is utilized as a host material for sulfur cathodes, in order to enhance the conductivity and to realize better electrochemical performance, especially at low current rates. For instance, a 50 wt % sulfur-loaded CNS cathode (CNS50S) shows a high specific capacity of 680 mA h g(-1) at C/10 rate even after 700 cycles with a gravimetric energy density of 415 W h kg(-1). When the in situ formed polar Fe2N/MCMB was introduced as an interlayer, excellent electrochemical performance is obtained for CNS@SS cathodes even at high rates due to the effective mitigation of lithium polysulfide dissolution and efficient reutilization of absorbed polysulfides on the interlayer surface. For example, CNS50SIL and CNS60SIL cathodes deliver a specific capacity of 343 and 518 mA h g(-1) at a high rate of 1C even after 120 cycles, respectively. This study offers ample scope to exploit CNS@SS composite cathodes for real-time applications and throws light on the importance of custom-designed Fe-based polar interlayers in improving the electrochemical behavior of Li-S batteries in terms of capacity at high rates.

Sulfur-carbon composite electrodes were prepared by grinding with a mortar and milling with a planetary ball-mill apparatus. Milling of a mixture of sulfur, acetylene black and the Li2S-P2S5 glass-ceramic electrolyte resulted in the amorphization of sulfur and a reduction in the particle size of the mixture. The charge-discharge properties of all-solid-state cells with the composite electrode were investigated at temperatures from -20 degrees C to 80 degrees C. The cells retained a reversible capacity higher than 850 mAhg(-1) for 200 cycles under 1.3 mA cm(-2) (333 mA g(-1)) at 25 degrees C. The cell performance was influenced by the crystallinity of sulfur and the particle size of the electrode material, whereby improved contact among the electrode components achieved by milling contributed to enhancement of the capacity of an all-solid-state Li/S cell.

Herein, we report a bio-inspired fabrication of fish scale-like carbon nanotiles, which were synthesized by a facile carbonization and grind procedure using kapok fibers (KFs) as green carbon source. Kapok fiber derived carbon nanotiles (KFCNTs) were used as the host of sulfur to construct KFCNTs/S cathodes for Li-S batteries. KFCNTs with scale-like microstructure are important for retarding the shuttling of soluble polysulfides, rendering S particles electrically conducting, and accommodating volume variation of S during the Li+ insertion/extraction. Owing to their unique microstructure, the resulting KFCNTs/S (93.2 wt%) electrodes exhibit a high and stable volumetric capacity of 504 mA h cm(-3) (calculated from the whole electrode, the corresponding gravimetric capacity is 524 mA h g(-1)) with a superior capacity retention up to 95.4% after 90 cycles at 0.4 A g(-1), representing a promising cathode material for rechargeable Li-S batteries. KFCNTs may also find potential applications in catalysis, electronics, sensors and separation technology. The bionic strategy outlined here can be generalized to other advanced electrode materials.

The adverse effects of metallic lithium are excluded by using symmetrical carbon-carbon cells. The results obtained on two types of porous electrodes, a carbon felt and a conventional mesoporous carbon electrode, are compared to those previously obtained on a flat glassy carbon electrode. The thickness of both porous electrodes as well as the thickness of porous separator are varied and impedance spectra studied in detail. The shapes, magnitudes and trends of various impedance features could well be reproduced by a proposed transmission line model. The model is upgraded with respect to known transmission line models in two ways: diffusion in pores of electrode is taken into account and a coupling of this diffusion to diffusion in separator is carried out. The results consistently show that the migration, reaction and diffusion impedances due to processes taking place inside a typical cathode are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the impedance due to diffusion of active species in the porous separator. However, the present findings strongly indicate that if one could suppress the leakage of polysulfides into the separator, the total impedance would drop dramatically, regardless of the actual thickness or porosity of the cathode.

Typically, PRC possesses cross-linked nano/microsheets with three-dimensional (3D) structure and large surface area, prepared by a puffing strategy. Moreover, TiC is further introduced into the carbon matrix (TiC/PRC) with excellent compatibility. TiC plays a dual role for not only enhancement of conductivity but also adsorption of soluble lithium polysulfides. When employed as a host of sulfur in LSBs, the designed TiC/PRC-S cathode exhibits improved rate capability, high reversible capacity of 1223.0 mA h g(-)(1) at 0.1 C, and long cycling life of 884.5 mA h g(-)(1) after 200 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergetic work of porous PRC architecture and polar conductive TiC with strong physisorption and chemisorption of soluble polysulfide simultaneously.

J	Fu, Y; Cheng, K; Hu, J; Zhou, LM				Fu, Yu; Cheng, Kui; Hu, Jing; Zhou, Limin			Integrating hierarchical porous nanosheets in the design of carbon cloth-based sandwiched sulfur cathodes to achieve high areal capacity in lithium sulfur batteries	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							LONG CYCLE LIFE; ELECTRODE	Due to the relatively small surface area of carbon cloth and its low possibilities for further architecturing, various hierarchical structures arein situgrown on carbon cloth in the fabrication of high sulfur loading cathode to achieve outstanding electrochemical properties. Despite high specific capacities in previously reported cathodes, areal capacity is unsatisfactory due to loading of low-mass sulfur. New techniques are still demanding to fulfill simultaneous achievements of high sulfur loading and high areal capacity. Herein, a three-dimensional interconnected network composed of Co(3)O(4)nanosheets is constructed for the first time on carbon cloth for high sulfur loading. In terms of this three-dimensional interconnected network, Co(3)O(4)nanosheets are not only grown on carbon fiber surfaces which can significantly increase the surface area for sulfur anchorage compared to pristine carbon cloth, but also within inter-fiber spacing where two adjacent carbon fibers are bridged, which is not yet achieved in any previously reported hierarchical structures of carbon cloth-based sulfur cathodes. Thus, this functionalized carbon cloth can provide significantly enlarged spaces for distribution of high mass loading sulfur. The thus-obtained sandwich-type sulfur cathode that integrates the functionalized carbon cloth and a pristine carbon cloth interlayer delivers a high areal capacity of similar to 3.63 mA h cm(-2)at a sulfur mass loading of similar to 5.5 mg cm(-2)and a capacity retention rate of similar to 93% after 200 discharge/charge cycles, which demonstrates a superior areal capacity to most of the previously reported carbon cloth-based sulfur cathodes. This study presents a new strategy for constructing a three-dimensional interconnected network to achieve high mass loading of active materials on flexible supports.

Nevertheless, the inhomogeneous deposition of Li' ions is apt to accelerate the emergence of dendritic Li, which is a brake on the practical application of lithium metal batteries. To solve this issue, herein, we propose nitrogen, sulfur-codoped carbon dots (N,S-CDs) as the deposition regulating additives of electrolyte to guide lithium ion homogeneous deposition. Within the electrolyte, N,S-CDs additives can absorb the surrounding Li+ ions and deposit homogeneously on the current collector, resulting in a uniform lithium deposition layer. As expected, at the presence of 0.3 mg/mL N,S-CDs, the long-term cycling stability over 1200 h and 300 h with low polarization are achieved both in the Li vertical bar Li symmetric cell at current density of 1.0 and 3.0 mA cm(-2), respectively. Meanwhile, there is an obvious contrast between the capacity retention in the Li-S full cell between the cell with and without N,S-CDs. In addition, it is worth noting that the beneficial effect of N,S-CDs for stable lithium metal anode is firstly demonstrated by means of confocal laser scanning microscope as well.

Herein, we propose a 3D nanocarbon architecture with robust electrical "highway" network for high sulfur mass loading and efficient sulfur utilization. The structure is constructed by "welding" highly conductive nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) together through in-situ polymeric crosslinking and nitrogen-doped carbon shell (NCS) formation. The highly sulfur-absorptive NCS provides strong physical and chemical confinements to sulfur and polysulfides, which is confirmed by in-situ Raman and electrochemical analysis. At a moderate sulfur loading, the NG-NCNT@NCS@S cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1421 mA h g(-1), excellent rate performance of 750 mA h g(-1) at 2 C and 465 mA h g(-1) at 5 C, and a capacity fading rate as low as 0.037% per cycle at 2 C for 1400 cycles. At high areal sulfur loading up to 10.2 mg cm(-2), the cathode retains a high areal capacity of 5.43 mA h cm(-2) after 150 cycles at a high current rate (1 C). A large areal cathode (77 x 50 mm(2)) with sulfur loading of 8.5 mg cm(-2) delivers a record-high capacity of 9.04 mA h cm(-2) at 0.1 C, demonstrating its great potential for practical application in Li/S batteries.

However, the molecular structure and reaction mechanism have not yet been fully understood. Herein, we present a new take on the structure and mechanism to interpret the electrochemical behaviors. We find that the thiyl radical is generated after the cleavage of the S-S bond in molecules in the first cycle, and then a conjugative structure can be formed due to electron delocalization of the thiyl radical on the pyridine backbone. The conjugative structure can react with lithium ions through a lithium coupled electron transfer process and form an ion-coordination bond reversibly. This could be the real reason for the superior lithium storage capability, in which the lithium polysulfide may not be formed. This study refreshes current knowledge of SPAN in Li-S batteries. In addition, the structural analysis is applicable to analyze the current organic cathodes in rechargeable batteries and also allows further applications in Al-S batteries to achieve high performance.

Even at a high rate of 2C, a high capacity of 528.6 mAh.g(-1) is obtained after 500 cycles. The excellent cycle stability and rate performance of the PANI@Se/C-G composite can be attributed to the synergistic combination of carbon black (as the conductive matrix for Se) and the double conductive layer comprising the uniform PANI shell and the graphene sheets, which effectively improves the utilization of selenium and significantly enhances the electronic conductivity of the whole electrode.

These porous carbon nanofibers (pCNFs) are both mesoporous and microporous, and attained high specific surface areas without the requirement of physical or chemical activation, which is mainly due to the in situ evaporation of the volatile solvent additive and the dissolution of the solvent in the ice water bath. The synthesis process is simple and versatile. The effects of the precursor components, precursor concentration and the collection method on the morphology and size distribution of the fibers have been investigated. The obtained pCNFs with porous structures and large surface areas were then utilized as conductive matrices for sulfur (S) to form pCNFs/S nanocomposites. Electrochemical measurements show that the pCNFs/S nanocomposite can deliver similar to 400 and similar to 340 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles and 100 cycles at 0.5 C, corresponding to 80.1% and 68% capacity retention with a high Coulombic efficiency, respectively.

However, only relying on the chemisorption of polar materials or the conductivity of carbon materials cannot effectively accelerate polysulfide redox kinetics. Therefore, it's urgent to propose an effective strategy to solve the above problems simultaneously so as to accomplish high-performance Li-S batteries. Hence, in this paper, we present a new separator, which could not only show strong chemisorption with polysulfides but also accelerate polysulfide redox kinetics. What's more, VS4/graphene (VS4/G) coating materials are electrochemically active in Li-S battery systems, which could provide extra capacity for Li-S batteries. Attributed to the strong adsorption, fast lithium ion diffusion, reduced polarization potential and facile lithium ion transfer rate across the separator, the batteries with VS4/G coating modified separators exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance. When cycled at 2C, they could deliver an initial specific capacity of 810 mA h g(-1), and when subjected to 2500 charge-discharge cycles, they could retain a decay rate as low as 0.021% per cycle.

This cathode shows 1.2-fold higher interfacial Li ion diffusivity (1.8x10(-12) cm(2) s(-1)) than that of an rGO/S cathode (1.5x10(-12) cm(2) s(-1)). This improvement is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hybrid matrix comprising rGO sheets and SnO2. The rGO sheets provide a fast electron pathway and accommodate a large amount of sulfur. Moreover, the dispersed SnO2 nanoparticle acts as an immobilizer to prevent the dissolution of polysulfide during the electrochemical reaction. The synthesized rGO/SnO2/S cathode also exhibits an electrical resistivity of 4.4x10(-1) Omega cm due to interfacial modification. Further, it exhibits improved electrochemical performance with an initial discharge capacity of 1591.57 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, which stabilizes to 606.98 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles. In addition, it shows a discharge capacity of 575.45 mA h g(-1) even at a high current density of 5 C.

Hollow, porous, and necklace-like Fe3C/N-codoped carbon nanoboxes (Fe3C/NC) connected by N-doped carbon (NC) nanofibers are designed by pulverizing Fe2O3 embedded in polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to produce multifunctional sulfur hosts, which exhibit multiple polysulfide anchoring and catalytic conversion activities. Experimental and first-principles density functional theory studies reveal that the uniformly distributed Fe3C and N units in the nanoboxes can significantly suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect. The conversion of polysulfides (LiPSs) to Li2S is catalyzed during discharge. The process relies on the fast electron transfer through the NC nanofibers and facilitated Li+ diffusion through the porous nanobox shells. The structural characteristics ("boxes in fibers") of the nanoboxes influence the high sulfur loading and tolerance of volume variation of LiPSs, resulting in the synergistic catalysis of the redox reactions. A high capacity of 645 mAh g(-1) after 240 cycles at 1 C, a high capacity of 712 mAh g(-1) at a high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, and an enhanced areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm(-2) are demonstrated.

The practical application of Li-S batteries is still limited by dramatically reduced capacities, cycling instabilities, and safety issues arising from flammable components. In this study, we designed and fabricated a flame-retardant, multifunctional interlayer which integrated electroconductive networks, lithium polysulfide (LiPS) traps and catalysts to significantly elevate the electrochemical performance and safety of pristine Li-S batteries. The LiPS adsorptive polymer polyimide (PI) constrains polysulfides to the cathode region and effectively suppresses the shuttle effect. Coralloid PI/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MCNT) compounds provide plentiful reaction sites for active materials. The catalytic Ni on the metal skeleton surface notably promotes Li+ diffusion, lowers the redox overpotential and accelerates LiPS conversion, which improves the redox kinetics associated with sulfur-related species and significantly elevates sulfur utilization. At different current densities of 0.2 C and 0.5 C, impressive initial discharge capacities of 1275.3 mA h g(-1) and 1190.9 mA h g(-1) are attainable respectively, with high capacity retentions of 80.3% and 78.6% over 600 cycles. Besides, the multifunctional interlayer can also act as a flame-retardant layer to promote the safety of Li-S batteries by inhibiting the spread of fire. This study provides a feasible and prospective strategy that adopts a multifunctional interlayer to develop Li-S batteries with higher capacities, longer cycling lives and safer working conditions.

We demonstrate that with the proper design of a relatively low surface area graphene/cellulose composite, a high electrochemical performance along with good cyclability can be achieved. Graphene cellulose composites are built from two constituents: a twodimensional electronic conductive graphene and cellulose fibres as a structural frame; together they form a laminar type of pore. The graphene sheets that uniformly anchor sulphur molecules provide confinement ability for polysulphides, sufficient space to accommodate sulphur volumetric expansion, a large contact area with the sulphur and a short transport pathway for both electrons and lithium ions. Nano-cellulose prevents the opening of graphene sheets due to the volume expansion caused by dissolved polysulphides during battery operation. This, in turn, prevents the diffusion of lithium polysulphides into the electrolyte, enabling a long cycle life. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Patel, Manu U.

Results show that the interaction between Li2Sx and graphene is dominated by dispersion interaction (physisorption), which depends on the size of molecule as well as the existence and type of defect sites on graphene. We find that single Li2Sx molecules interact only slightly stronger to the SW sites than to the defect-free sites, but they interact very strongly with single-vacant defects. In the later cases, the vacant site catches one S atom from the Li2Sx molecule, leading to the formation of a Li2Sx-1 molecule, which adsorbs weakly on the created S-doped graphene. This study suggests that defect sites can not improve the ability of graphene to catch lithium polysulfides in Li-S batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Considering that, a multifunctional interlayer, prepared by weaving ferrocene-based two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (Zr-Fc MOF) nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNT) via simple vacuum filtration, is proposed to achieve high-performance Li-S battery. Using a combination of in situ Raman spectroscopy, first-principles calculations and systematic electrochemical evaluation, we unveil that the Zr-Fc MOF, as a new polysulfides confinement agent, can not only restrain polysulfides shuttling via both electrostatic attraction and chemical anchoring capability, but also provide excellent electrocatalytic effect on polysulfides redox kinetics. The intertwined CNT throughout Zr-Fc MOF nanosheets facilitates electron conductivity as well as sufficient exposure of capturing and catalyzing active sites of Zr-Fc MOF. Accordingly, attributed to the synergistic entrapping-catalysis-conversion effect, we demonstrate that Li-S cell coupling with the as-prepared Zr-Fc MOF/CNT interlayer exhibits a dramatically enhanced rate performance and outstanding cyclability (1500 cycles at 1 C with ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.027% under sulfur loading of 4.11 mg cm(-2)). This work will inspire more intelligent 2D MOF materials simultaneously with highly efficient trapping and catalytic conversion of polysulfides for high-energy and long-life Li-S battery.

J	Lin, YX; Zheng, J; Wang, CS; Qi, Y				Lin, Yuxiao; Zheng, Jing; Wang, Chunsheng; Qi, Yue			The origin of the two-plateaued or one-plateaued open circuit voltage in Li-S batteries	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Li-S batteries; First principle calculation; Li-polysulfide solvation; Nano structure design; Concentrated electrolyte	SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; ANODE SURFACE; ION; CATHODE; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITES; SOLVATION; STABILITY	Li-S batteries have been actively pursued as a storage device of high energy density. Interestingly, most of the discharging curves for Li-S batteries show either one plateau or two plateaus. Understanding the mechanism and conditions of the one-plateaued discharging curves can provide guidance for Li-S battery design to prevent the Li-polysulfide (Li-PS) dissolution. In this article, we first calculated a solvent-dependent open circuit voltage (OCV) using density functional theory (DFT) when both crystals (S, Li2S, Li) and dissolved Li-PS molecules (such as Li2S4) are involved in the discharging reactions. We successfully predicted the two-plateaued OCV with fully solvated Li-PS and the one-plateaued OCV with non-solvated Li-PS, in agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, if Li-PS changes from partial or non-solvated state to fully solvated state, its formation energy increases, leading to a transition from the one-plateaued to the two-plateaued OCV. The partially solvated Li-PS can be realized either by a highly-concentrated electrolyte or by minimizing the pore size in the carbon/sulfur composites to limit the number of solvents transported into the pores, which changes the complex liquid-solid reactions of Li-S chemistry to a single solid-state reaction. The solid-state reaction allows Li-S batteries to operate in lean electrolytes with less Li excess. A new Li-PS dissolution mitigation strategy based on this synergetic effect is therefore proposed by modeling and verified by experiments.

The major challenges associated with the sulfur cathode in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are up to 76% volume change during cycling from sulfur (S) to lithium sulfide (Li2S) and the shuttle effect of polysulfide anions, resulting in poor cycling performance. Herein, we design a network binder through the crosslinking effect of sodiumalginate (SA) and Cu2+ ions (named the SA-Cu binder), in which Cu2+ ions work not only as an ionic crosslinking agent for a robust network structure, but also as a chemical binding agent for polysulfide anions. The robust network binder buffers large volume variations during cycling, while electropositive Cu2+ ions immobilize polysulfide anions through strong chemical binding. The resulting sulfur electrode delivers a capacity of 925 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C, which is much higher than those of sulfur electrodes with only SA and PVDF binders. Due to the robust mechanical properties of the SA-Cu binder, a high-loading and crack-free sulfur electrode, i.e., a sulfur loading up to 8.05 mg cm(-2), is also achieved and delivers a high areal capacity up to 9.5 mA h cm(-2). This study paves a new way to immobilize polysulfide anions using the dual functions of Cu2+ ions as both the ionic crosslinking and chemical binding agents, which could open up a new direction for advanced binders for Li-S batteries in the near future.

However, it suffers from low sulfur content (<45 wt %), which limits the composite capacity and thereby the energy density. Herein, we prepared cross-linked PAN precursor with porous structure and high specific area via an intermolecular cross-linking method. The prepared cross-linked PAN offers more space to accommodate sulfur molecules, rendering the effective sulfur content up to 53.63 wt %. It realizes a remarkable reversible specific capacity of 829 mAh g(composites)(-1) at 0.2 C. As a result, it provides a way to prepare the S@pPAN cathodes for a lithium-sulfur battery with high energy density and good electrochemical performances.

Sulfur is infiltrated into porous carbon with meso/micropores by using an improved vapor-melting adsorption method, which aims to enhance sulfur dispersion and interaction with carbon host. Meanwhile, carbon fiber with weaved structure can connect the dispersed micron S/HPC particles on the current collector. As a result, a highly conductive network around the sulfur particles finally forms in the sulfur/carbon cathode. Results show that improved vapour-melting method can efficiently enhance the sulfur dispersion and interaction with carbon host. Electrochemical measurements show that both of the rate capacity and cycle stability of the sulfur/carbon cathode are significantly improved. It delivers a very high initial discharge capacity of 1692.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, and maintains 1030 mAh g(-1) after 130 cycles at 0.5 C. Furthermore, the weave-structured HPC-CF carbon materials increases the conductivity effectively, which enhances the rate performance of the prepared S/HPC-CF cathode. It shows 670.8 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle and remains 520 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 6.0 C with an average coulombic efficiency of 97.8%. The excellent cycle and rate performance of theprepared Sv-m/HPC-CF can be attributed to the high cathode conductivity, high sulfur utilization and strong interaction between sulfur and the HPC-CF materials.

But the "shuttle effect" still hinders its application. Here, carbon/gelatin microcapsule (C/GM) as a microreactor for sulfur cathode to suppress "shuttle effect" is prepared. The submicron-sulfur particles, which are synthesized with the regulation of gelatin, are encapsulated in the C/GM so that a region-limited electrochemical reaction can be realized. Benefiting from the micro-reactor inhibiting the dissolution of polysulfide, the initial discharge specific capacity of lithium-sulfur battery with C/GM cathode is up to 1259.0 mAh/g and still retains 961.0 mAh/g after 100 cycles. Due to the sustainable source and facile method, the C/GM cathode is promising for the application of lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, we have prepared the metal-organic frameworks-derived CoP anchored on Ti3C2 MXene (MOFs-CoP@MXene) and fully explored its synergy as an efficient bifunctional electrode for enhanced lithium storage for the first time. It is gratifying that the prepared MOFs-CoP@MXene provides a high capacity of 706.5 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1), as the anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). It can provide 585.8 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles with 0.5 A g(-1). The MOFs-CoP@MXene anode has robust lithium-ion storage capacity, indicating that it can increase the charge transfer rate and improve Li+ diffusion kinetics with enhanced electrochemical activity. As lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) cathode, MOFs-CoP@MXene/S shows 796.9 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.2C. MOFs-derived CoP coupling with MXene exhibits enhanced capture capacity of sulfur, facilitating the conversion of polysulfides. The results show that the MOFs-CoP@MXene composite prepared for the first time are feasible as both the anode of LIBs and the cathode of LSBs.

X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and specific surface area measurements all indicated that elemental sulfur was distributed evenly throughout the MWCNTs. The electrochemical tests showed that the initial discharge specific capacity of an elemental sulfur positive electrode with MWCNTs was 1487.0 mAh.g(-1) and the utilization of electrochemically active sulfur was 88.9%. The specific capacity remained as high as 913.7 mAh.g(-1) after 50 cycles which showed that the electrochemical properties of the sulfur cathode with the addition of MWCNTs were remarkably improved.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to their high theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g(-1). Despite their high theoretical capacity, Li-S batteries have been plagued with fast capacity loss and dissolution and diffusion of the polysulfides. In this study, honeycomb polyaniline-dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid-sulfuric acid (hPANI-DBSA-H2SO4) was prepared using the breath figure (BF) method. Then, sulfur was electrodeposited on hPANI-DBSA-H2SO4 and used to investigate the electrochemical properties of the Li-S cells. hPANI-DBSA-H2SO4/S exhibited a higher capacity and excellent reversible capacity of 894 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C, and a columbic efficiency of 99.2% over 100 cycles was achieved. These results indicate that the honeycomb structure is likely to prevent the dissolution of the polysulfides. The findings suggest that this cathode can also be useful when applying Li-S cathodes for use in high capacity Li-S batteries.	[Sovizi, M. R.; Gheshlaghi, Z.

Meanwhile, the chemisorption behaviors of polysulfides and the capability of WN as an effective confiner are systematically investigated through density functional theory calculations and experimental studies. The theoretical calculations reveal a decrease in chemisorption strength between WN and the soluble polysulfides (Li2S8 > Li2S6 > Li2S4), while the interactions between WN and the insoluble Li2S2/Li2S show a high chemisorption strength of ca. 3 eV. Validating theoretical insights through electrochemical measurements further manifest that the assembled battery configurations with sulfur cathode confined in the thickest WN blocks exhibit the best rate capabilities (1090 and 510 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and 5C, respectively) with the highest initial Coulombic efficiency of 90.5%. Moreover, a reversible capacity of 358 mAh g(-1) is maintained with a high Coulombic efficiency approaching to 100%, even after 500 cycles at 2C. As guided by in silico design, this work not only provides an effective strategy to improve the retentivity of polysulfides but also underpins that properly architectured WN can be effective retainers of polysulfides.

The conversion of sulfur is particularly appealing as it is associated with a theoretical gravimetric energy density up to 2510 Wh kg(-1). In this paper, three different carbon-iron disulfide-sulfur (C-FeS2-S) composites are proposed as alternative positive electrode materials for all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries. These are synthesized through a facile, low-cost, single-step ball-milling procedure. It is found that the crystalline structure (evaluated by X-ray diffraction) and the morphology of the composites (evaluated by scanning electron microscopy) are greatly influenced by the FeS2:S ratio. Li/LiI-Li3PS4/C-FeS2-S solid-state cells are tested under galvanostatic conditions, while differential capacity plots are used to discuss the peculiar electrochemical features of these novel materials. These cells deliver capacities as high as 1200 mAh g((FeS2+S))(-1) at the intermediate loading of 1 mg cm(-2) (1.2 mAh cm(-2)), and up to 3.55 mAh cm(-2) for active material loadings as high as 5 mg cm(-2) at 20 degrees C. Such an excellent performance, rarely reported for (sulfur/metal sulfide)-based, all solid-state cells, makes these composites highly promising for real application where high positive electrode loadings are required.

Here, a novel flexible 3D nitrogen-doped graphene supported V2O3/VN heterogeneous host was constructed by a facile topochemical nitridation strategy. Such unique architecture endowed the V2O3 with strong adsorption activity and the highly conductive VN with superior catalytic capability, synergistically promotes the redox kinetics and effectively restrains the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Impressively, the designed V2O3@VN-20 electrode exhibited a high reversible capacity of 1130 mA h g(-1) and 980 mA h g(-1) at 1C and 2C respectively, and maintained long-term cyclability with a low capacity decay of 0.1% per cycle after 300 cycles at 5C.

When carbon materials are used for immobilizing sulfur, the technical challenge is designing their framework to relieve the shuttle effect of polysulfides intermediates and the volume change of sulfur, and to improve the conductivity of sulfur. Herein, polyaniline-based carbon (PANI-C) coated corn starch-based activated carbon spheres (ACS@PANI-C) was prepared and used as hosts of sulfur, which can effectively combine the advantages of physical entrapment and chemical binding interactions of sulfur species. The results of electrochemical performance test indicate that S/ACS@PANI-C composites exhibit much better electrochemical performance than S/ACS composites. Its reversible capacities at 320, 480, 800 and 1600 mA g(-1) are 687, 582, 504 and 393 mAh g(-1), respectively. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the PANI-C which can also act as a flexible cushion to accommodate volume changes of sulfur cathode as well as a barrier to trap soluble polysulfide intermediates during the charge-discharge process.

This substrate material is controlled to be nanosized with abundant catalytically active sites and widely-distributed pore through the cross-linked porous conductive skeleton, further promoting the electrolyte penetration and charge transfer. In addition, the introduction of MoO2 tailors the Ti electronic states, so the substrate material renders high adsorption energy of -1.47 eV for Li2S6 by theoretical calculation. Furthermore, the cathode exhibits high conversion efficiency from long-chain lithium polysulfide to Li2S (Q(low)/Q(high) (the conversion capacity of Li2S) is 2.91 at 0.1C) and excellent sulfur utilization and fast sulfur reaction kinetics. The cathode also exhibits a low-capacity fade and excellent cycling performance.

Therefore, in this study, potassium ferrate was used to carbonize the petals of a hibiscus flower, and the doping of Fe3C was realized at the same time as the carbonization to prepare in one step a porous biochar nanosheet (Fe3C-HSB) composite material loaded with Fe3C particles. Fe3C plays a key role in lithium polysulfide (LiPS) chemical adsorption and other aspects, which can greatly improve the cycle stability of Li-S batteries. Because the prepared composite material has a unique nanosheet structure, it can effectively shorten the ion diffusion length, improve the electron charge transfer ability, and accelerate the progress of the electrochemical reaction. When sulfur is injected at 80.0 wt%, the discharge capacity of the Fe3C-HSB@S composite material is 777.1 mA h g(-1), and it is stable at a rate of 1C. After 500 cycles, its reversible capacity can still reach 451.3 mA h g(-1), with a single-turn capacity attenuation rate of 0.083%. Therefore, the rational design of porous biochar nanosheets doped with Fe3C particles is of great significance for improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, realizing renewable energy technologies, and promoting industrial applications.

Herein, a novel bio-inspired reactor with ant-nest like architecture was tailored for Li-S electrochemistry, which combines abundant active nickel nanoparticles with hierarchical porous carbon-nanosheets network (HPCN/Ni). The nanoreactor provides multiple functions including strong trapping efficiency with polysulfides, fast transfer of ions/electrons and liquid sulfur species, and sufficient catalytic activity. The cooperative effects could accelerate Li-S redox reactions and improve sulfur utilization. Enhanced by the highly efficient HPCN/Ni naonoreactor, Li-S cells demonstrate a high specific capacity of 1437.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, remarkable rate performances such as 900 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, and exellent cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 734.2 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 C. Even at a high sulfur area loading of 5.63 mg cm(-2), a high area capacity of 4.75 mAh cm-2 could be achieved. This contribution affords a fesible approach to design and construct nanoreactors with high efficiency for Li-S batteries and the analogous applications. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the poor ion transport between the cathode materials greatly hinders the capacity performance of ASSLBs. Herein, an electron/ion dual-conductive electrode framework is proposed for superior performance ASSLBs. Highly electronic conductive reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes interconnect with active materials in the cathodes, constructing a three-dimensional continuous electron transport network. The composite electrolyte penetrates into the porous structure of the electrode, forming a consecutive ionic conductive framework. Furthermore, the thin electrolyte film formed on the surface of the cathode effectively lowers the interfacial resistance with the electrolyte membrane. Highly electron/ion conductive electrodes, combined with the polyethylene oxide-Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (PEO-LLZTO) composite electrolyte, show excellent capacity performance for both LiFePO4 and sulfur (lithium-sulfur battery) active materials. In addition, the LiFePO4 cathode demonstrates superior capacity performance and rate capability at room temperature. Furthermore, the relationship between the low Coulombic efficiency and Li dendrite growth has been revealed in this work. An effective layer is formed on the surface of Li metal by the simple modification of cupric fluoride (CuF2), which can stabilize the electrolyte/anode interface. Finally, high-performance ASSLBs with high Coulombic efficiency can be achieved.

In Situ Self-Formed Nanosheet MoS3/Reduced Graphene Oxide Material Showing Superior Performance as a Lithium-Ion Battery Cathode	ACS NANO			English	Article						lithium-ion battery cathode material; molybdenum trisulfide; in situ electrochemical treatment; self-formed nanosheet; nano solid electrolyte interphase layer	AMORPHOUS MOS3; COMPOSITE; ANODE	Although lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have 5-10 times higher theoretical capacity (1675 mAh g(-1)) than present commercial lithium-ion batteries, Li-S batteries show a rapid and continuous capacity fading due to the polysulfide dissolution in common electrolytes. Here, we propose the use of a sulfur-based cathode material, amorphous MoS3 and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) composite, which can be substituted for the pure sulfur-based cathodes. In order to enhance kinetics and stability of the electrodes, we intentionally pulverize the microsized MoS3 sheet into nanosheets and form an ultrathin nano-SEI on the surface using in situ electrochemical methods. Then, the pulverized nanosheets are securely anchored by the oxygen functional group of r-GO. As a result, the electrochemically treated MoS3/r-GO electrode shows superior performance that surpasses pure sulfur-based electrodes; it exhibits a capacity of about 900 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 5C for 2500 cycles without capacity fading. Moreover, a full-cell battery employing the MoS3/r-GO cathode with a silicon-carbon composite anode displays a 3-5 times higher energy density (1725 Wh kg(-1)/7100 Wh L-1) than present LIBs.

However, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) tend to shuttle during battery cycling and corrode the Li anode; this leads to an eventual performance fading in the Li-S battery. This shuttle effect can be reduced by accelerating the conversion of dissolved polysulfides to insoluble LiPSs and back to sulfur. Herein, a novel 2D Mo(0.5)W(0.5)S(2)alloy with a 2H (semiconducting)-1T (metallic) mixed-phase is synthesized on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a two-step process of co-sputtering and sulfurization. The cathode comprising 2D Mo0.5W0.5S2-CNTs exhibits the synergistic effect of accelerated electron transfer, a higher LiPS binding effect, and good catalytic performance, as confirmed by our electrochemical analysis. As a result, the Li-S battery cell assembled with the 2D Mo0.5W0.5S2/CNT/S cathode shows a high specific capacity of 1228 mA h g(-1)at 0.1C and a much higher cycling stability as compared to the pristine cathodes.

While this type of cell produces good capacity during the early cycles, unwanted reactions with the electrolyte degrade the cathode and anode; making the whole cell not competitive with Li-ion batteries. A viable solution to mitigate this problem is the replacement of the carbon, binder, and electrolyte with a ceramic matrix, with high electronic and ionic conductivity. Lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) spinel may be a potential candidate for the fabrication of composite cathodes, due to its mechanical robustness and its high electronic and Li-ion conductivity. In this paper, we present an ab initio molecular dynamics study complemented with experimental investigations, offering a novel interpretation for the Li-ion mobility in Li4Ti5O12 and Li7Ti5O12 as well as for the chemical reactivity of these materials with molecular sulfur. Also, we present a model for the passivation of Li4Ti5O12 and Li7Ti5O12 surfaces by lithium carbonate, addressing both Li-ion mobility at the interface and sulfur reactivity. On the basis of our results, the deployment of Li4Ti5O12 and Li7Ti5O12 materials for sulfur-based battery technology is questioned mainly by the lower Li-ion conductivity of the carbonate-passivated surfaces and by the chemical reactivity of Li7Ti5O12 with sulfur molecules, which would lead to self-discharge, with resulting loss of capacity and inferior battery performance.

The results of SEM and XPS show the formation of a homogeneous and dense film with a thickness of 84 nm on Li metal surface. AC impedance and polarization test results show the improved interfacial stability. The interfacial resistances as well as polarization potential difference have obviously decreased as compared with that of a pristine Li anode. CV and charge-discharge test results demonstrate that more reversible discharge capacity and higher Coulombic efficiency can be achieved. Specific capacity of 760 mAh g(-1) and an average Coulombic efficiency of 98% are retained after 100 cycles at 0.5C without LiNO3 additive. Additionally, the Li-S cell with a modified Li anode displays a greatly improved rate performance with similar to 425 mAh g(-1) at SC, making it more attractive and competitive in the applications of high-power supply.

The carbon fiber composite coated on a Cu substrate was composed of vapor-grown carbon fiber (VGCF (R)-H) and poly(vinylidene fluoride). The coulombic efficiency for dissolution of Li deposits on the VGCF (R)-H modified Cu electrode was kept more than 98% at 100th cycle and higher than that on a Cu electrode in the solvate ionic liquid. Li was deposited in the porous structure of the VGCF (R)-H modified Cu electrode and scarcely observed on the surface of the VGCF (R)-H modified Cu probably because the overpotential for the reduction of Li is smaller on the Cu substrate and/or deposited Li than that on the cylindrical basal plane of VGCF (R)-H. This result suggests that the voids in the carbon fiber network effectively act as the Li deposition sites at the electrode separator interface in the coin cell.

Scanning electronic microscopy revealed the formation of a highly hierarchical mesoporous and macroporous structure. High resolution transmission electronic microscopy confirmed homogeneous dispersion of S, PPy and MWNT in the composite. In this composite, polypyrrole with its high adhesion ability to MWNT acts as a conductive binder to connect sulfur and MWNT matrix, as well as absorbs polysulfides into its porous structure positively affecting the composite performance as a cathode in a Li/S cell. The resulting S/PPy/MWNT composite cathode exhibited greatly enhanced cyclability and delivered a reversible discharge capacity of 751 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The tremendous challenges in increasing the specific energy and power density of batteries lie mainly in the cathode materials. Lots of attempts have been made to improve the reversible capacity and rate capability of cathode materials for lithium ion batteries in the past few years. On the one hand, the rate capability of the cathode materials depends strongly on their surface structures, which determine the kinetics of lithium ion transportation and intercalation. Through tuning the surface structure of cathode materials, the density of channels for fast Li+ diffusion can be increased, and therefore enhance greatly the surface/interfacial transportation kinetics of lithium ions. On the other hand, the reversible capacity of the cathode materials of lithium ion batteries is in direct proportion to the number of electrons transferred, thus exploration of high capacity cathode materials beyond intercalation, such as sulfur cathodes, has been conducted extensively. The utilization efficiency of sulfur active materials, the reaction kinetics and trapping of soluble polysulfides depend also on the structure of sulfur cathodes. This review outlines recent developments in structure-tuning of the most appealing cathode materials, including layered lithium metal oxides, olivine structured LiFePO4, spinel LiMn2O4 and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, as well as sulfur cathodes. The structure-dependent properties of the cathode materials are summarized, mainly focusing on electrochemical performance, which can provide an in-depth understanding and rational design of high performance cathode materials. Further direction and perspectives of research in the present field are also addressed.

Three kinds of composite materials, S-AMCS-0.15, SAMCS-0.3 and S-AMCS-1.5, were prepared by the real air phase method, and the corresponding sulfur contents were 52%, 46% and 42%, respectively. The structure and morphology of various materials were characterized. The electrochemical properties of the three composites were investigated and compared. The experimental results show that S-AMCS-0.15 has good electrochemical performance. Due to the small particle size of AMCS-0.15 carbon microspheres, the active materials inside the spheres can be fully reacted. In order to further optimize the electrochemical properties of the composite, the material was treated by ball milling. The results show that the capacity retention and cycling properties of the composite have been improved to a certain extent. The discharge specific capacity in the second week also increased from 720 mAh g(-1) to more than 1180 mAh g(-1). And the discharge capacity maintained above 800 mAh g(-1) for the first 60 cycles.

However, the sulfide oxidation reactions (SORs) in sulfur cathode are much more sluggish, which is mainly restricted by high conversion barriers. Herein, the catalytic "Li-N" bond sites are designed to activate SORs in high areal loading cathode with the multi-functions of bridging the active materials and carbon matrix tightly. The presence of catalytic "Li-N" bonds is co-revealed by X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy and electronic energy loss spectroscope. As unraveled by theoretical physical van der Waals interaction analysis and various electrochemical tests, the improved kinetics and mechanism of SORs are achieved by motivating polysulfide interconversions and propelling lithium ion diffusion. Consequently, the so-fabricated electrode with abundant Li-N bond catalytic sites deliveries 900 mA h g-1 at 0.05 C and a stable retention of 74.3% at 1 C after 300 cycles. More impressively, high-loading with high-weight-content cathodes remain rapid SORs kinetics, high capacity utilization and retention from 3.0 to 6.9 mg cm-2.

To address these issues, in this work, lithiophilic silver layers with 80 nm thickness are coated on the commercial carbon cloth (CC) using thermal evaporation method to regulate Li growth during lithium plating process. We find that the uniformly distributed silver layers can successfully reduce lithium nucleation over-potential, thus inducing the homogeneous deposition of metal Li, supported by density functional theory calculation. Benefited from the as prepared lithiophilic Ag layers, the CC/Ag/Li anode with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 16 mAh cm(-2) is achieved adopting electrochemical deposition at 0.2 mA cm(-2) without the formation of lithium dendrites, which is confirmed by continuous detection using visual discrimination and scanning electron microscope observation. As a result, a stable dendrite-free CC/Ag/Li anode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties: (1) the assembled CC/Ag/Li symmetrical cell maintains a stable voltage hysteresis within 25 mV after cycling 750 hat a current density of 1 mA cm(-2); (2) The assembled CC/Ag/Li-LiFePO4 cell also demonstrates enhanced electrochemical behaviors in terms of rate performance and capacity retention; (3) When coupled with a carbon/sulfur cathode, the CC/Ag/Li anode also demonstrates excellent compatibility. The initial discharge capacity of the CC/Ag/Li-S cell is 899.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, the reversible capacity retains a value of 587.7 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles, corresponding to a capacity attenuation rate of 0.075% per cycle.

The composites are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms as well as by galvanostatic cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in lithium-cell. Both samples show well defined micrometric morphology and a sulfur content as high as 66% expected to reflect into rather high practical energy density of the electrode in lithium-sulfur battery. The lithium sulfur cell using the FPC-S composite exhibits at 25 degrees C a moderate cycling stability with delivered capacity ranging from 1000 to about 610 mAh g(-1) upon 50 cycles at 100 mA g(-1). The AFPC-S composite reveals increased cycling stability and delivers a capacity ranging from 1000 to 680 mAh g(-1). Improved capacity is achieved by slightly increasing the temperature, as demonstrated by cycling the FPC-S at 35 degrees C using a current as high as 500 mA g(-1). The excellent rate capability of the electrode is associated to the carbon texture and morphology that significantly lower the cell resistance, as indeed demonstrated by EIS measurement upon cycling.

J	Han, X; Zhang, ZY; Xu, XF				Han, Xu; Zhang, Zeyun; Xu, Xuefei			Single atom catalysts supported on N-doped graphene toward fast kinetics in Li-S batteries: a theoretical study	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; PLANE-WAVE; ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; CONVERSION; CARBON; NITROGEN; SURFACE; POLYSULFIDES; PERFORMANCE	To suppress the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and promote fast kinetics of the charge-discharge process in Li-S batteries, it is essential to search for promising catalysts with sufficient stability and high activity. Here, we employ density functional theory to explore the performance of 3d, 4d and 5d transition metals embedded in nitrogen-doped defective graphene (M@N/G, including M@N3/G and M@N4/G) as single atom catalysts toward fast kinetics in Li-S batteries. Four evaluation criteria of M@N/G are established to guide the screening of catalysts. Electronic structure analysis shows that the nitrogen coordination environment can largely tune the valence orbital splitting of the metal center and further affect the intrinsic activity of catalysts; M@N4/G exhibits superior catalytic performance to M@N3/G. We also found that sulfur-metal interactions play a critical role in the adsorption and activation of sulfur species on M@N/G. We therefore propose to use the sulfur atom adsorption free energy as a descriptor of catalytic activity combined with the knowledge of M-3d@N/G to effectively predict the activity of M-4d,M-5d@N/G. As a result, we expect that the Sc, Cr, Mn, Ru, Os, and Ir single metal atom catalysts supported on N4/G have better than or at least comparable catalytic performance to the ever-reported V, Fe, and Co@N4/G for Li-S batteries. In particular, because of the low cost, Cr@N4/G and Mn@N4/G are preferentially recommended with a small free energy change of the rate-determining step (0.62 eV and 0.54 eV) during discharge and a low decomposition barrier of *Li2S (1.42 eV and 1.29 eV) during charge simultaneously. Our study builds a novel screening strategy and can guide future theoretical study on catalysts toward Li-S batteries with fast kinetics.

Nitrogen doping in the edges of buckybowls increases the bowl depth than in the hub position. Buckybowls with pyridinic nitrogen holds lithium polysulfides with higher adsorption energies. Besides, the deeper bowl depth enhances the adsorption of lithium polysulfides. Bowl to bowl inversion is observed during the interaction with lithium polysulfides. 2 N-Pyridinic-azacorannulene exhibits better lithium polysulfide adsorption than all other 2D surfaces due to lower chemical hardness and higher bowl depth. The inference obtained in the present study can help design better scaffold material for lithium polysulfide adsorption.

However, its practical applications have been hindered by its insulating nature (i.e., S and its discharge product Li2S), substantial volume changes, and detrimental shuttle effect (polysulfide intermediates). Nanostructured hosts with high conductivity and strong polysulfide entrapment are the prerequisites for high capacity and long -cycle life Li -S batteries. Here, we report a carbonaceous host based on N, S co -doped carbon nanowall decorated graphene (NSCNW-G) via a supramolecular strategy, which simultaneously achieves abundant voids for sulfur species accommodation and fast redox kinetics of polysulfides. As a result, NSCNW-G/S delivers a high capacity of 1246 mA h g(-1) at 0.02C, superb cycling stability with an ultralow decay rate of 0.021% per cycle for as long as 800 cycles at 0.5C, and a stable coulombic efficiency of up to 98% with a high mass loading of approximately 80 wt%. Even with a high areal loading of 3.2 mg cm(-2), a capacity of 510 mA h g(-1) is still retained after 300 cycles at 0.5C. Our present supramolecular strategy demonstrates a feasible pathway to the rational design of advanced carbonaceous materials for Li -S batteries and other electrochemical applications.

Nevertheless, lithium pulverization and associated loss of electrical contact remain significant challenges. Here, an antipulverization and high-continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid-state electrolyte (SSE) nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper (Cu) foil as the supporting current collector is reported. Guiding by the SSE, this new anode facilitates lithium nucleation, contributing to form a roundly shaped, micro-sized, and dendrite-free electrode during cycling, which effectively mitigates the lithium dendrite growth. The embedded Cu current collector in the hybrid anode not only reinforces the mechanical strength but also improves the efficient charge transfer among active lithium filaments, affording good electrode structural integrity and electrical continuity. As a result, this antipulverization and high-continuity lithium anode delivers a high average Coulombic efficiency of approximate to 99.6% for 300 cycles under a current density of 1 mA cm(-2). Lithium-sulfur batteries (elemental sulfur or sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathodes) equipped with this anode show high-capacity retentions in their corresponding ether-based or carbonate-based electrolytes, respectively. This new electrode provides important insight into the design of electrodes that may experience large volume variation during operations.

Herein, we demonstrate a novel and simple strategy-using a bifunctional separator, prepared by spraying poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) on a pristine separator-to obtain long-cycle LSBs. The negatively charged SO3- groups present in PSS act as an electrostatic shield for soluble lithium polysulfides through mutual coulombic repulsion, whereas PEDOT provides chemical interactions with insoluble polysulfides (Li2S, Li2S2). The dual shielding effect can provide an efficient protection from the shuttling phenomenon by confining lithium polysulfides to the cathode side of the battery. Moreover, coating with PEDOT: PSS transforms the surface of the separator from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, thereby improving the electrochemical performance. We observed an ultralow decay of 0.0364% per cycle when we ran the battery for 1000 cycles at 0.25C-far superior to that of the pristine separator and one of the lowest recorded values reported at a low current density. We examined the versatility of our separator by preparing a flexible battery that functioned well under various stress conditions; it displayed flawless performance. Accordingly, this economical and simple strategy appears to be an ideal platform for commercialization of LSBs.

However, the low conductivity of sulfur and the shuttle effect, widely presenting in the lithiation/de-lithiation process, seriously hinder its practical application. Here, we report a new nanoconfined oxidation route (first complete oxidation of metal sulfide and subsequently partial oxidation of the generated S from sulfide) for S cathode encapsulated with MnO2 nanosheets and N-doped carbon hollow spheres. This nanoconfined oxidation route can successfully confine the sulfur particles in the interior of the carbon shell, and the rationally introduced nonpolar carbon and polar MnO2 can both reduce the dissolution of polysulfide during the charge-discharge process. The obtained well-defined S-MnO2@C cathode exhibits high specific capacity with excellent cycling performance and superior rate capability.

However, besides the requirements for cathode flexibility, intrinsic limitations from the shuttling of lithium polysulfides and the growth of Li dendrites have restricted the widespread implementations of Li-S batteries. Here, we report a wet-processed strategy by dissolving and recrystallizing S in a suitable solvent to fabricate a flexible, binder-free S cathode. Integrating the resulting S cathode with a dual-functional separator has demonstrated to be able to suppress both the shuttle effect and growth of dendritic Li. The wet-processed strategy not only enables the fabrication of flexible and binder-free S-nanomat cathodes, but also facilitates the deposition of the cathodes on the separators. Meanwhile, a dual-functional separator is fabricated by vapor-phase polymerization of polypyrrole (PPy) coating on both surfaces of the commercial separator, which leads to the reduction of the shuttle effect and the suppression of the growth of dendritic Li simultaneously. As a result, by integrating the S-nanomat and the dual-functional separator, the cathode exhibits exceptional mechanical properties and electrochemical performance. Li-S pouch cells are further demonstrated to show stable cycling performance in the bending state, indicating the feasibility of the integrated S cathode for flexible Li-S batteries.

Moreover, the challenges of the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and the high solubility of polysulfide intermediates still hinder its practical application. Here, we report a kind of free-standing and foldable cathodes consisting of 3D activated carbon fiber matrix and sulfur cathode. The 3D activated carbon fiber matrix (ACFC) has continuous conductive framework and sufficient internal space to provide a long-distance and continuous high-speed electron pathway. It also gives a very larger internal space and tortuous cathode region to ACFC accommodate a highly sulfur loading and keeps polysulfide within the cathode. The unique structured 3D foldable sulfur cathode using a foldable ACFC as matrix delivers a reversible capacity of about 979 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, a capacity retention of 98% after 100 cycles, and 0.02% capacity attenuation per cycle. Even at an areal capacity of 6 mAh cm(-2), which is 2 times higher than the values of Li-ion battery, it still maintains an excellent rate capability and cycling performance.

In the highly concentrated region, Li ions clearly diffuse faster than SL and TFSA anions. The two oxygen atoms of the SL sulfonyl group tend to coordinate to two different neighboring Li ions and TFSA anions form ionic clusters with Li ions, verifying the previous observation of the unusual Li-ion conduction and its relevance to the SL-and anion-bridged, chainlike Li-ion coordination structure for the SL-based concentrated systems with other Li salts. Moreover, addition of hydrofluoroether (HFE) to the SL-based concentrated electrolytes greatly enhances diffusion coefficients but fragments the chainlike Li-ion coordination to smaller clusters, leading to a reduced contribution of Li-ion hopping to the overall Li-ion conduction. The SL-based concentrated electrolyte and its mixtures with HFE showed lower lithium polysulfide solubility and higher rate capability for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells compared with previously reported tetraglyme-based electrolytes. The SL-based electrolytes were found to manifest a significant improvement in Li-ion mass transfer as a sparingly solvating electrolyte, enabling the solid-state sulfur redox reactions in high-performance Li-S batteries.

J	Tian, Y; Yang, M; Wang, C				Tian, Yuan; Yang, Ming; Wang, Cheng			Highly efficient flexible Li-S full batteries with hollow Ru-RuO2-x nanofibers as robust polysulfide anchoring-catalysts and lithium dendrite inhibitors	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							CONVERSION; VACANCIES; OXYGEN	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high theoretical energy densities are a promising next-generation energy storage system. However, it is not easy to simultaneously obtain highly effective utilization of a sulfur cathode and dendrite-free lithium anode for commercial use. Herein, a free-standing conductive fabric is made up of N-doped hollow carbon nanofibers implanted with defective Ru-RuO(2-x)in situ, which is employed as a dual-functional host for both the sulfur cathode and lithium anode. Oxygen vacancy-rich in-doped Ru-RuO2-x heterostructures endow the surrounding nanofibers with abundant active sites and subtly tailor the density of state (DOS) distribution near the Fermi level, facilitating continuous reactivation and enhancing the conductivity. Furthermore, the composite interwoven by the hollow nanofibers has a large inner space and unique three-dimensional frame architecture. As the sulfur host, such synergetic merits effectively strengthen the sulfur immobilization, accommodate the volume expansion and catalyze the redox reactions. Meanwhile, the well-designed Li host is highly lithiophilic and can facilitate homogeneous nucleation and suppress Li dendrite growth, leading to outstanding stable cycling performance over 400 h with a high current density of 5 mA cm(-2) during Li plating/stripping. Considering these advantages, the Li-S full battery (denoted as S/Ru-RuO2-x@NC||Li/Ru-RuO2-x@NC) delivers a high areal capacity of 5.8 mA h cm(-2) at 0.1C with a sulfur loading of 6.8 mg cm(-2). This work offers a significant defect engineering strategy for rational heterostructure modulation to realize flexible and durable Li-S full batteries, analysed using a series of experimental analyses and theoretical simulation.

Here, the construction of Al-Li alloy/LiCl-based Li anode (ALA/Li anode) is reported by displacement and alloying reaction between an AlCl3-ionic liquid and a Li foil. This layer not only has high ion-conductivity and good electron resistivity but also much improved mechanical strength (776 MPa) as well as good flexibility compared to a common solid electrolyte interphase layer (585 MPa). The high mechanical strength of the Al-Li alloy interlayer effectively eliminates volume expansion and dendrite growth in Li metal batteries, so that the ALA/Li anode achieves superior cycling for 1600 h (2.0 mA cm(-2)) and 1000 cycles at an ultrahigh current density (20 mA cm(-2)) without dendrite formation in symmetric batteries. In lithium-sulfur batteries, the dense alloy layer prevents direct contact between polysulfides and Li metal, inhibiting the shuttle effect and electrolyte decomposition. Long cycling performance is achieved even at a high current density (4 C) and a low electrolyte/sulfur (6.0 mu L mg(-1)). This easy fabrication process provides a strategy to realize reliable safety during the rapid charging of Li-metal batteries.

Practical considerations in designing solid state Li-S cells for electric aviation	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article							IONIC-CONDUCTIVITY; ELECTROLYTES; BATTERIES; PROPAGATION; COMPOSITE	The development of high-energy, high-safety, and high-power batteries beyond electric automotive stan-dards is critical for future electric aviation applications. Non-volatile solid-state electrolytes (SSE) offer many promising advantages over traditional flammable liquid electrolytes. SSE may become an enabling technology for certain battery chemistries by preventing detrimental interactions that occur with liquid electrolytes, for example preventing dissolution of lithium-sulfur intermediates common in traditional liq-uid organic solvents. However, significant manufacturing challenges must be overcome before the adop-tion of such technology. One of the main challenges is the fabrication of sufficiently thin electrolyte layer to maximize specific energy of the solid-state cell. In this work we first show the feasibility in the as-sembly of an all solid-state battery via the development of composite SSE with ionic conductivity above 0.2mS/cm and thicknesses on the order of 40 micron through a tape-casting technique. With Li/Al al-loy as the anode and TiS2 as the active cathode material, the resultant solid-state battery with a thin electrolyte layer and excellent cathode-electrolyte interface represents a prototype vision on a potential solid-state cell required for electric aviation. A detailed parameter analysis is further presented on the influence of the various cell metrics, such as electrolyte thickness, carbon content, active material uti-lization, and excess lithium, on the cell specific energy. The implications in the optimization of these required parameters to enable practical solid-state Li-S batteries for electric aviation are discussed. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the precise synthesis and control of such subtle nanostructures are still highly challenging, indicating the untapped potential in the future nano energy systems. In this work, a simple but robust colloidal chemistry method is established to synthesize the ultrathin lanthanide oxide nanoscrolls, which achieves the atomically-thin thickness with scrolled edges for the first time. Detailed mechanism studies confirm that the scrolling behavior of nanoscrolls is initiated by surface charge perturbance induced by the adsorption of bromoalkyl group in the surfactant 3-bromopropyl trimethylammonium bromide. More importantly, experiments demonstrate the reversible and controllable scrolling of the subnano thin lanthanide nanoscrolls. As proof of the actual application, the ultrathin lanthanide oxide nanoscroll/carbon nanotube film has been employed for the lithium-sulfur battery as the interlayer, which demonstrated excellent electrochemical performances. Our method is broadly applicable for the high-yield production of novel inorganic ultrathin nanostructures with great potential for applications in energy systems.

Interestingly, compared with typical synthesis methods of Ni-Co sulfide, this new synthetic method supplies nickel source through Ni-foam rather than soluble inorganic salt and avoid destroying the original structure in the process of secondary hydrothermal reaction. With the integrity of the whole mechanical structure of the hosts, the hybrid electrode behave strong chemical bonding for polysulfides and superior electrocatalytic activity for accelerating the polysulfides redox reactions. The results revealed that foam-like structure of S/Ni-foam@Ni-Co sulfide (S/NF@NCS-30) electrode delivers the highest capacity of 1352.36 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 10 cycles and the initial capacity of S/NF@NCS-30 electrode is 1920.28 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. The results offer a facile and promising engineering strategy to achieve high sulfur utilization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Resorcinol-formaldehyde based carbon aerogels (RF-CAs) are considered to be a promising candidate for advanced energy storage, owing to their low density, high electrical conductivity, high porosity and chemical inertness, etc. It has been found that numerous researches have focused on the preparations of RF-CAs (such as polymerization process, drying method, carbonization temperature and activation modes, etc.) and their applications in energy storage devices. However, systematic investigations into the surface chemistry, microstructure and applications of RF-CAs are rarely documented. Herein, this review has summarized the recent progress in tailoring RF-CAs toward supercapacitors and other advanced energy storage, such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries and lithium sulfur batteries. Additionally, we put an emphasis on the physico-chemical principles of synthesis strategies and specific illustration of structure-performance relationship.

It is clear that investigating isolated active materials is no longer sufficient to solve all kinds of technological challenges for the development of modern battery infrastructure. From the interface chemistry point of view, a system-level strategy of designing polydopamine coated reduced graphene oxide/sulfur composite cathodes aimed at enhancing cyclic performance was reported in this work. As a soft buffer layer, the polydopamine shell was used to accommodate the volume expansion of S and avoid the leakage of polysulfide during cycling. A cross-link reaction between polydopamine buffer and poly(acrylic acid) binder was further designed to improve the strength of the entire electrode. As a result, the electrode demonstrated excellent cyclic performance with a discharge capacity of 728 mAh/g after 500 cycles at the current density of 0.5 A/g (a very small capacity loss of 0.41 mAh/g per cycle). Most importantly, 530 mAh/g was obtained even at a higher current density of 1 A/g after 800 cycles. Our results indicate the importance of chemically designing interfaces in the whole electrode system on achieving improved performance of electrodes of rechargeable lithium ion batteries.

However, the sulfur content in cathode materials is usually unsatisfactory due to the excessive use of carbon for improving the conductivity. Traditional cathode fabrication strategies can hardly realize both high sulfur content and homogeneous sulfur distribution without aggregation. Herein, we designed a cathode material with ultrahigh sulfur content of 88%(mass fraction) by uniformly distributing the water dispersible sulfur nanoparticles on three-dimensionally conductive graphene framework. The water processable fabrication can maximize the homogeneous contact between sulfur nanoparticles and graphene, improving the utilization of the interconnected conductive surface. The obtained cathode material showed a capacity of 500 mA center dot h/g after 500 cycles at 2.0 A/g with an areal loading of 2 mg/cm(2). This strategy provides possibility for the mass production of high-performance electrode materials for high-capacity Li-S battery.

An Improved Cycling Performance of Different Types of Composite Sulfur-Carbon Cathodes with the Use of Lithium Polysulfides Containing Electrolyte Solutions	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						lithium sulfur cells; lithium metal anodes; lithium poly-sulfides; additives; activated carbon powder; microporous carbon; composite sulfur cathode	SALTS	We report on stabilization of Li-S cells with different types of composite sulfur cathodes using ethereal LiTFSI/LiNO3/DOL/DME electrolyte solutions containing a-priori 0.1 M Li2S8. These electrolyte solutions enable an improved cycling behavior for Li-S cells compared to Li(2)S(8-)free electrolyte solutions, thanks to the presence of LiSx species from the beginning of operation. We show that Li anodes cycled in Li divide S cells with solutions containing Li2S8 possess flatter and more uniform surface, higher dimensions of the surface structures in average and, as a result, a lower surface area. This surface morphology ensures a low rate of parasitic surface reactions of the electrolyte components on the Li anodes' surface, slower depletion of the electrolyte solution in the cells and stabilization of the cells cycling. Besides, the presence of Li2S8 maintains a better integrity of composite sulfur/carbon/PVdF cathodes, ensuring a better electronic contact between the particles in the composite cathodes. We believe that we outline herein a logical approach for practical Li-S batteries, emphasizing high energy density, cost effectiveness and relatively simple production procedures.

Here, we report a facile microwave-impulse-based method to synthesize multifunctional rGO/MoS2/MoO2 heterostructure characterized with lamellar MoS2/MoO2 heterojunctions attached to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets. Microwaves can directly work on the precursor materials, and the preparation process can be completed in only 100 s. The rGO/MoS2/MoO2 composite could give strong chemisorption ability and excellent catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LPSs) while maintaining a relatively high conductivity from the rGO matrix. Moreover, permselective rGO/MoS2/MoO2 layers with numerous micron-size pores can trap polysulfide anions while promoting the diffusion of Li+, which is of great significance in efforts to improve the cycling stability and reaction kinetics of LSBs. A cell with an rGO/MoS2/MoO2-coated separator retains 62.1% of its capacity with a 0.12% capacity decay per cycle over 300 cycles at 0.5C. This work offers an innovative route for the rapid preparation of multifunctional separators for LSBs.

Herein, we demonstrate a simple tellurium doping method to intrinsically reshape the electronic properties of the sulfur and manipulate the kinetics of Li-S chemistry for improving the performance of Li-S batteries. DFT calculation indicates that Te doping can effectively facilitate the lithiation/delithiation reactions and lower the lithium ion diffusion energy barrier in Li2S. Additionally, electrochemical studies prove that the reaction kinetics of Li-S chemistry and cycling performance of Li-S batteries have been significantly improved with Te dopants. An exceptional specific capacity of-similar to 656 mA h g(-1) and a high Coulombic efficiency of similar to 99% have been achieved at 5 A g(-1) even after 1000 cycles. More importantly, the capability to manipulate the intrinsic properties of materials and explore the synergistic effects between conventional strategies and element doping provides new avenues for Li-S batteries and beyond.

Here we demonstrate the formation of microdomain sulfur in the open pore CNT assembly. We obtain microdomain sulfur on CNTs coated with CeO2 nanoparticles, explained by local spontaneous dewetting. Our microdomain sulfur-deposited CNT-based electrodes perform fast kinetics of sulfur transformation and high utilization of sulfur, especially at high C-rate and high current density conditions. Li-S battery cells with our electrodes achieve excellent long-term stability under high C-rate (capacity reduction of 0.044% per cycle up to 300 cycles at 2C), and high capacity even with high sulfur loading (an areal capacity of 5.6 mAh/cm(2)). Our approach presents facile and low-cost route to designing high performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, we fabricate reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) three-dimensional (3D) foams encapsulating polar mesoporous zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanosheets and subsequently utilize the ZnS/r-GO foams to load sulfur (ZnS/r-GO/S) as cathodes for improving the performance of Li-S batteries. The mesoporous diameter of the ZnS nanosheets is approximately 10 similar to 30 nm and lots of pores in the 3D foams are observed. The porous structure provides abundant sites to adsorb and accommodate sulfur species. The cathode of the ZnS/r-GO/S exhibits 1259 mA h g(-1) of initial capacity and 971.9 mA h g(-1) of the reversible capacity after 200 cycles at 0.1C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)). At 1 C, it still exhibits the tiny capacity decay rate of 0.019% per cycle after 300 cycles. This work may be adopted to combine the nonpolar and polar materials as a 3D network structure for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Many of the current porous carbon substrates are composed of particulates, making it difficult to form a self-supported structure. Herein, novel highly porous nitrogen-doped graphene fiber webs (N-GFWs) are prepared using a facile wet-spinning method. The wet chemical process facilitates simultaneous N-doping and surface wrinkling of graphene fibers in a one-pot process. The atomic structure and electrical conductivity of N-GFWs are tailored by tuning the degree of N-doping and thermal reduction for multi-battery charge storage in both lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs) and lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). The N-GFW900 electrode presents an excellent electrocatalytic activity and the cathode with a high areal loading of 7.5 mg cm(-2) delivers a remarkable areal capacity of 2 mA h cm(-2) at 0.2 mA cm(-2) for LOBs. The N-GFW700 interlayer with abundant oxygenated and nitrogen functional groups demonstrates effective entrapment of polysulfides in LSBs, delivering a much improved specific capacity after 200 cycles at 0.5C with a remarkable decay rate of 0.04%. The current approach paves the way for rational design of porous graphene-based electrodes, satisfying multifunctional requirements for high-energy storage applications.

Herein hollow VO2@S microspheres were designed as cathode materials with high volumetric capacity by combining the intercalation and conversion mechanisms. The hollow microsphere can offer enough space for high sulfur loading, which results in a high tap density of 1.64 g cm(-3), while VO2 can offer additional capacity by Li intercalation reactions and has strong interactions with polysulfides to prevent the shuttling effect by its in situ surface sulfidation. Therefore, the obtained materials delivered a high volumetric capacity (1084 mA h cm(-3) at 0.1C) and good rate capability and cycling performance (440 mA h g(-1) at 1.0C after 200 cycles). This study demonstrates that traditional cathode materials with a proper potential window would be an alternative host for sulfur to offer additional capacity and increase the energy density due to their high tap density.

The effect of the precursor composition and calcination temperature on the Mg0.6Ni0.4O powder properties was investigated. These particles were used as an additive to prepare S/Mg0.6Ni0.4O composite via ball-milling with sulfur. The composite preparation conditions were optimized to achieve the higher specific surface area without compromising the sample crystallinity. The SEM observation revealed that the sulfur morphology was drastically changed by the Mg0.6Ni0.4O addition, from smooth to rough agglomerated particles. This change has enhanced the electrochemical performance of the composite cathode. Cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests demonstrated enhanced reversibility and high sulfur utilization in a Li/S cell with S/Mg0.6Ni0.4O cathode, delivering about 850 mAh g(-1) of reversible capacity at the initial cycle. The effect of the Mg0.6Ni0.4O heat treatment temperature on the S/Mg0.6Ni0.4O cycling performance was also investigated. The cathode with Mg0.6Ni0.4O calcined at 700 degrees C exhibited enhanced capacity retention which could be due to its high specific surface area and nanosized structure. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The coulombic efficiency and capacity retention of Li-S batteries are significantly improved with the use of F-EPE/DME based electrolyte combing with PEO as binder. The Li-S batteries exhibit a high coulombic efficiency of similar to 96% and capacity retention of 78% after 100 cycles at 0.1C. Moreover, the F-EPE based electrolyte can work well without LiNO3 additive, thus make it possible to eliminate the safety concerns raised by the gassing reaction of LiNO3. The function mechanism of F-EPE as cosolvent was investigated by self-discharge test, polysulfide dissolution experiments, SEM and UV-Vis spectra. The enhanced electrochemical performances can be attributed to that F-EPE cannot only decrease the solubility of lithium polysulfides in electrolyte thus suppress the shuttle effect, but also take part in the formation of passivation film on lithium metal anode, indicating the positive effect of F-EPE on electrochemical properties of Li-S batteries.

Herein, the oxygen-defective Li 4 Ti 5 O 12-x hollow microspheres uniformly encapsulated by N-doped carbon layer (OD-LTO@NC) is delicately designed as an intrinsically polar inorganic sulfur host for the research on the catalytic mechanism. Theoretical simulations have demonstrated that the existence of oxygen deficiencies enhances the adsorption capability of spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 towards soluble lithium polysulfides. Some -S-S- bonds of the Li 2 S 6 on the defective Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 surface are fractured by the strong adsorption force, which allows the inert bridging sulfur atoms to be converted into the susceptible terminal sulfur atoms, and reduces the activation energy of the polysulfide conversion in some degree. In addition, with the N-doped carbon layer, secondary hollow microspheres architecture built with primary ultrathin nanosheets provide a large amount of void space and active sites for sulfur storage, adsorption and conversion. The as-designed sulfur host exhibits a remarkable rate capability of 547 mAh g ???1 at 4 C (1 C = 1675 mA g ???1 ) and an outstanding long-term cyclability (519 mAh g ???1 after 10 0 0 cycles at 3 C). Besides, a high specific capacity of 832 mAh g ???1 is delivered even after 100 cycles under a high sulfur mass loading of 3.2 mg cm ???2 , indicating its superior electrochemical performances. This work not only provides a strong proof for the application of oxygen defect in the adsorption and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides, but offers a promising avenue to achieve high performance LSBs with the material design concept of incorporating oxygen-deficient spinel structure with hierarchical hollow frameworks. ?? 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

Herein, an all-liquid-phase reaction mechanism, where all the discharging intermediates are dissolved in the functional thioether-based electrolyte, is proposed to significantly enhance the kinetics of Li-S battery chemistry at low temperatures. A fast liquid-phase reaction pathway thus replaces the conventional slow solid-solid conversion route. Spectral investigations and molecular dynamics simulations jointly elucidate the greatly enhanced kinetics due to the highly decentralized state of solvated intermediates in the electrolyte. Overall, the battery brings an ultrahigh specific capacity of 1563 mAh g(-1) sulfur in the cathode at -60 degrees C. This work provides a strategy for developing cryogenic Li-S batteries.

Herein, nitrogen/sulfur dual-doped hierarchically porous carbon networks (NSC) with hierarchical pores and high N/S-doped content are constructed via a simple sol-gel route followed by two-step annealing under different atmospheres. The carbon networks are used as host materials and interlayers for LSBs to greatly improve the cycling and rate performances. The battery shows a superb incipient capacity (similar to 1000 mAh g(-1)) after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 C. Remarkably, it retains a superior cycling performance for 500 cycles with large specific capacities of 647.1 and 393.6 mAh g(-1) at high current densities of 2.0 and 5.0 C, respectively. Such satisfying electrochemical performances of NSC-based cells benefit from the synergetic effect of NSC materials, which not only immobilizes lithium polysulfides via strong interactions of Li-N and S-S, but also improves redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides to effectively suppress the shuttle effect. Accordingly, the reasonable design of NSC materials will be distinctly vital for promoting cycle performances of the LSBs and enhancing its practical applications.

J	Aaldering, LJ; Song, CH				Aaldering, Lukas Jan; Song, Chie Hoon			Tracing the technological development trajectory in post-lithium-ion battery technologies: A patent-based approach	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Post lithium-ion batteries; Lithium sulfur battery; Lithium air battery; Sodium-ion battery; Patent analysis; Link prediction	ENERGY-STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES; CO-CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; LINK-PREDICTION; CITATION NETWORK; RECENT PROGRESS; HYBRID; INNOVATION; IDENTIFICATION	With the ever-growing energy demands, new battery chemistries beyond lithium ion technology are required to deal with an increased power consumption and promote the vehicle electrification. However, there are still challenges in understanding the cognitive structure of evolving R&D processes. The study of the patent landscape can provide a complementary perspective on the trajectories of technological change and facilitate interdisciplinary discussions that help make future technology planning more rationally. In this study, we investigate the technological development trajectory of post-lithium-ion battery technologies based on the analysis of patent data. A data-driven approach, which comprises of patent co-classification analysis, application of link prediction algorithm and text mining technique, is used to highlight the recent research progress on selected post-lithium-ion battery technologies. These are lithium air, lithium sulfur and sodium-ion batteries. A lithium air battery is composed of a lithium metal anode, a porous carbon cathode with high catalytic activities towards electrochemical oxygen reactions, and either an aqueous or non-aqueous electrolyte. Similarly, a lithium sulfur battery consists of a lithium metal anode, a sulfur composite cathode, and an organic electrolyte. Sodium-ion batteries share the same architecture as the lithium ion-batteries, but are normally based on carbonaceous anode materials, layered transition metal oxides cathode demonstrating a minimal structural change upon intercalation, and aqueous electrolytes. The results indicate that the number of patents related to postlithium-ion battery technologies has noticeably increased since 2008. A few East Asian countries and USA dominate the underlying patent landscape. The co-classification analysis showed that not only the amount of interacting knowledge areas but also the cross-linking with adjacent technological knowledge areas has increased. Moreover, the knowledge areas related to the electric vehicles and polymer applications are predicted to gain more relevance in the future. According to the text mining results, the most common application areas comprise vehicles, devices, energy storage, computers and phones. The main innovations of this study are as follows: First, it identified the current research trends and prospects for the post-lithium-ion battery technologies based on the insights gained from objective data, assisting R&D planners in determining their further directions for research and development. The exploration of the technological development trajectory of post-lithium-ion battery could serve as a reference for relevant researchers to better understand the dynamics and make strategic adjustments, which have profound significance for the progress of clean energy and green chemistry development. Second, it discovered the dynamics of interacting knowledge areas, which indicate an increased tendency of technology convergence. In case of lithium air and lithium sulfur batteries, notable interactions between knowledge areas pertaining to the core battery components (cell configurations and electrolytes) and application-driven knowledge fields (electric vehicles and phones) were observed. The intensity of these interactions was rather weak in case of sodium-ion battery technology. Accordingly, researchers need to seek for new knowledge outside of their traditional knowledge boundaries to accelerate the commercial breakthrough of post-lithium-ion batteries. In particular, knowledge areas related to electrical vehicles have gained in importance in all of the examined battery technologies, reflecting the drive to produce high-energy battery systems. Third, it predicted the knowledge areas that could gain more relevance in the future research by comparing the predictive power of different machine learning algorithms. This forward-looking approach can add a new empirical perspective to the discussion of sustainable technology development. Fourth, in contrast to common assumption, it showed that SIBs could also power up portable applications like mobile devices or electric vehicles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The 3DG/TM heterostructure is constructed by few-layered graphene nanosheets sandwiched by hydrophilic, metallic, few-layered 1T MoS2 nanosheets with abundant active sites. The porous 3D structure and the hydrophilic feature of 1T-MoS2 are beneficial for electrolyte penetration and Li-ion transfer, and the high conductivities of both graphene and the 1T MoS2 nanosheets facilitate electron transfer. These merits lead to a high electrocatalytic efficiency for LiPSs due to excellent ion/electron transfer and the presence of sufficient electrocatalytic active sites. Therefore, the cells with 3DG/TM exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance, with a high reversible discharge capacity of 1181 mA h g(-1) and a capacity retention of 96.3% after 200 cycles. The electrocatalysis mechanism of LiPSs is further experimentally and theoretically revealed, which provides new insights and opportunities to develop advanced Li-S batteries with highly efficient electrocatalysts for LiPS conversion.

The prepared SiO2@C-2.5S cathode exhibits superior electrochemical properties, which can be attributed to the physical adsorption of porous carbon shell and chemical anchoring effect of SiO2 nanoparticles.

However, the inferior conversion efficiency of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in essence leads to fast capacity decay, especially at a large current density during the charge-discharge process. Herein, we have successfully demonstrated that the conversion efficiency of LiPSs was remarkably promoted by employing nickel nanoparticles incorporated with nitrogen-doped multi-channel carbon nanofibers (Ni-NMCCF) as a multifunctional modification layer of the separator. The high polarity of the nitrogen atoms and the Lewis acid characteristics of the nickel atoms collectively create strong anchoring activity towards LiPSs, therefore leading to the severe inhibition of the occurrence of the shuttle effect. The electrocatalytic activity of the nickel nanoparticles greatly accelerates the reversible conversion efficiency of LiPSs, ensuring high capacity retention during long-term cycling. Thanks to these advantages, Ni-NMCCF delivered a superb rate performance of 1020 mA h g(-1) at 1C and maintained 671 mA h g(-1) even after 500 cycles, which is equivalent to a capacity decay of only 0.07% per cycle.

A self-standing 3D-printed sulfur/carbon cathode with high sulfur loading based on a low-cost commercial carbon black was fabricated via a facile robocasting 3D printing process. The 3D-printed sulfur/carbon cathode shows excellent electrochemical performance in terms of capacity, cycling stability, and rate retention by facilitating Li+/e(-) transport at the macro-, micro-, and nano-scale in Li-S batteries. Meanwhile, the areal loading of the sulfur/carbon cathode can be easily controlled by the number of stacking layers during 3D printing process. The Li-S batteries assembled with the 3D-printed sulfur/carbon cathodes with a sulfur-loading of 3 mg cm(-2) deliver a stable capacity of 564 mA h g(-1) within 200 cycles at 3 C. Moreover, cathodes with a sulfur-loading of 5.5 mg cm(-2) show large initial specific discharge capacities of 1009 mA h g(-1) and 912 mA h g(-1), and high capacity retentions of 87% and 85% after 200 cycles at rates as high as 1C and 2C (equaling to high areal current densities of 9.2 mA cm(-2) and 18.4 mA cm(-2)), respectively.

The particle size of MTC microsphere is between 2 and 3.4 mu m, and the N-doped amorphous C around TiO2 could provide a conductive matrix, and buffer the volume change. When evaluated as electrodes for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and Li-S batteries (LSBs), the MTC microsphere exhibits relatively high discharge-voltage plateau, excellent capacity retention and rate capability. As anode for LIBs, after 200 cycles, a reversible capacity more than 230 mA h g(-1) can achieved at 1 C. And for LSBs, a specific capacity of 1317.7 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and the capacity retention of 73.8% after 500 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance is ascribed to robust scaffolding architecture and conductive N-doped carbon matrix. The excellent electrochemical performance and process ability of the MTC microspheres make them very attractive as electrode materials for use in high rate battery application.

However, 2D graphene layers are easily stacked, which may significantly reduce the surface area and degrade the excellent electrical properties of graphene. To avoid this, one of the most effective methods is to construct 3D graphene (3DG) with specific porous microstructures. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an important method for the synthesis of high-quality 3DG, where templates play a defining role in controlling the structure and cost of 3DG. Metallic materials with 3D microstructures, such as nickel foam, have proven to be useful as substrates for the growth of high-quality 3DG. However, metal substrates are usually expensive, and the pickling solution generated after etching may cause environmental problems. Therefore, non-metallic substrate materials with lower costs have been investigated for the preparation of 3DG. Herein, we developed a novel template material, mammal bone ashes, for the CVD preparation of 3DG. Mammal bone ash is an inexpensive and abundant biomass hydroxyapatite. During the high-temperature CVD reaction, the bone ash powders were slightly sintered to form a continuous porous structure with graphene coating. The morphology of 3DG is inherited from the microstructure of bone ash templates. After removing the bone ash template with hydrochloric acid, the template-grown 3DG was obtained with a unique bicontinuous structure, i.e. both the graphene framework and the void space were continuous. In addition, the pickling solution of the bone ash templates after etching was exactly the same as that for the raw materials for the production of phosphoric acid to achieve high atom utilization. We further optimized the graphitization degrees, layer number, and porous morphology of 3DGs. The microstructure evolution of 3DG is highly relevant to the layer thickness and uniformity of graphene layers. A short growth time would lead to a non-uniform and thin layer of graphene, which is not able to support a complex 3D porous structure. In contrast, a uniform graphene layer with proper thickness is capable of forming a robust 3D architecture. In addition, the facile CVD method can be extended to a series of metal phosphate templates, including tricalcium phosphate [Ca-3(PO4)(2)], trimagnesium phosphate [Mg-3(PO4)(2)], and aluminum phosphate [AlPO4]. 3DG with bicontinuous morphology is promising as a conductive frame material in electrochemical energy storage devices. As an illustration, high-performance Li-S batteries were fabricated by the uniform composition of an S cathode on 3DG. In comparison with heavily stacked 2D graphene sheets in reduced graphene oxide / S composite, the non-flat structure of 3DGs remained unchanged even after the harsh melt-diffusion process of high-viscosity liquid sulfur. The resulting 3DG/S cathode delivered a high specific capacity of similar to 550 mAh.g(-1) at a high current rate (2C). Our work opens an avenue to the low-cost and high-utility production of 3D graphene, which could be integrated with the well-developed phosphorus chemical industry.

The addition of Se to S is considered a rational design principle to regulate the polarization of Li-S cells intrinsically. Moreover, the electrochemical utilization of solid-state Li2-xS (0.0 <= x <= 1.0) provides sufficiently high theoretical specific capacity (836 mA h g(-1)) and long-term stability. However, solid-state Se-doped Li-S compounds during (de)lithiation have not been studied in detail. Therefore, we performed combined experimental and theoretical studies to reveal the reduction of polarization by Se doping owing to multiple factors that were previously assumed to be negligible. Experimentally, the polarization reduction in Se-doped Li2S is dependent on the electronic, ionic, and thermodynamic properties of the Se dopant. Theoretically, Se doping simultaneously lowers the formation energy, bond symmetry of Li-S(Se), energy required for structural changes, and electronic stability, resulting in the reduction of polarization. Our concrete understanding of the two types of Li-S electrodes can aid the design of advanced high-energy solid-state Li-S batteries.

To achieve such goals, new advanced materials are urgently required. Atomically dispersed materials (ADMs) with single-atom metals supported on substrates feature uniform metallic sites and represent the utmost utilization of atoms, demonstrating wide applications in catalysis. These structural and morphological characteristics also make ADMs attractive materials for rechargeable batteries. Herein, we highlight and summarize the recent advances in synthetic methods for ADMs by physical confinement and chemical bonding. Subsequently, we summarize the recent progress in the design of diverse ADMs for lithium metal, lithium-sulfur, sodium-sulfur, lithium-oxygen, and zinc-air batteries and unveil the corresponding roles of ADMs from atomistic perspectives. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in this field are discussed.

However, challenges remain in achieving fast electronic and ionic transport while accommodating the significant cathode volumetric change, especially for the cathode with a high practical mass loading. Here we report a cathode architecture, which is constructed by burning lithium foils in a CS2 vapour. The obtained structure features crystalline Li2S nanoparticles wrapped by few-layer graphene (Li2S@ graphene nanocapsules). Because of the improvement on the volumetric efficiency for accommodating sulfur active species and electrical properties, the cathode design enables promising electrochemical performance. More notably, at a loading of 10 mg(Li2S) cm(-2), the electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1,160 mAh g(-1) s, namely, an area capacity of 8.1 mAhcm(-2). Li2S@ graphene cathode demonstrates a great potential for Li-ion batteries, where the Li2S@ graphene-cathode//graphite-anode cell displays a high capacity of 730 mAh g(-1) s aswell as stable cycle performance.

J	Fu, XW; Wang, Y; Scudiero, L; Zhong, WH				Fu, Xuewei; Wang, Yu; Scudiero, Louis; Zhong, Wei-Hong			A polymeric nanocomposite interlayer as ion-transport-regulator for trapping polysulfides and stabilizing lithium metal	ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Polymeric nanocomposite; Separator coating; Polysulfides trapping; Lithium anode stabilization	SULFUR BATTERIES; CYCLING STABILITY; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; CATHODE MATERIAL; PERFORMANCE; SEPARATOR; COMPOSITE; GRAPHENE; LIFE; IMMOBILIZER	Inserting an interlayer between cathode and separator represents a feasible approach for potentially addressing two severe issues in lithium-sulfur batteries: diffusion of polysulfides and growth of lithium dendrites. Thus far, there is a lack of cost-effective strategies to fabricate and characterize the interlayers, as well as a comprehensive understanding of their roles. Herein, we design, fabricate, characterize and gain understanding of an advanced battery interlayer capable of addressing the above two critical issues simultaneously. This porous-structured interlayer with a design of integrating polysulfide-blocking function, good mechanical properties and good adhesion to separator is fabricated by coating a functional porous polymeric nanocomposite on the separator. These functions/properties are realized via a rational combination of two polymers (a "functional" polymer of ultra-high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) and a "structural" polymer of poly(vinylidene fluoride)) with conductive fillers. The synergistic effect from the two polymers and the resulting porous structure make the interlayer an excellent ion-transport-regulator, which can benefit trapping the dissolved polysulfides, and more importantly, improve the stability of the lithium metal anode. Further, through comprehensive characterizations on the interlayer, the structure-property-performance relationships for the multifunctional interlayer are established, which favors the development of advanced energy storage devices pursuing controllable and express ion-transport between two electrodes.

However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and severe polysulfides dissolution and migration hinder it practical application. To address the problems, we design a hierarchical yolk-shell structure with polar metal oxide Mn(3)O(4 )yolks and N-doped carbon shells as sulfur host. The N-doped carbon shell enhances the conductivity and provide physical confinement to polysulfides while the Mn3O4 yolks have strong chemical bonding effect with polysulfides. Besides, the sufficient void space in yolk-shell structure can ensure a high sulfur loading content (80%) as well as accommodate severe volume change of sulfur during lithiation. Benefiting from these merits, the yolk-shell Mn3O4@NC/S electrode exhibit a high capacity of 581 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and enhanced cycling stability with a capacity retain of 84% over 300 cycles at 0.5 C, which is superior to yolk-shell Mn3O4@NC/S with more Mn3O4 residual and N-doped carbon shells/S without Mn(3)O(4 )inside.

Using a Metal Oxide Nanoparticle Interlayer To Efficiently Anchor Polysulfides at High Mass Loading S-Cathodes in Li-S Rechargeable Battery	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						high mass loading S-cathode; interlayer; surface trapping of polysulfide; ex situ spectroscopy; Li-S battery	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; CATALYTIC-ACTIVITY; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; OXYGEN REDUCTION; NICKEL-OXIDE; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; SHELL; BETA-NI(OH)(2); FABRICATION	The bulk of the work related to a Li-S rechargeable battery revolves around materials design strategies of a suitable carbon(/noncarbon) host matrix targeted toward the entrapment of sulfur and prevention of leaching out of polysulfides into the electrolyte. This strategy, however, limits the extent of sulfur loading and, depending on the host, may simultaneously increase the unutilizable mass of sulfur in the electrode. Recently, usage of interlayers between conventional S vertical bar C composite cathode and separator has been demonstrated in Li-S batteries. This interlayer, mostly carbon or doped carbon, has been used to trap the polysulfides in between the interlayer and S-cathode. Instead of carbon, we demonstrate here an alternative and novel interlayer of metal oxide nanoparticles between cathode and separator to efficiently trap and arrest the polysulfides at the S-cathode. Oxide-based compounds exhibit a superior ability to hold the lower order polysulfides toward the S-cathode by bonding interactions, thereby enhancing anode protection. We employ pseudocapacitive metal oxides viz. Ni(OH)(2) and NiO as the interlayers for efficient anchoring of the polysulfide. In the presence of the Ni(OH)(2)/NiO nanoparticle interlayer, an alternative pathway for sulfur reduction and oxidation takes place which simultaneously leads to a phenomenal reduction in the polysulfide shuttle effect, even at extremely high loadings of sulfur (up to 15 mg cm(-2)). The beneficial role of the interlayers in inhibiting the shuttle effect is studied via in depth ex situ UV-vis and powder X-ray diffraction of the battery separator and the interlayer, respectively, cycled at various depths of discharge and charge. The conventional Li-S cell with S/C composite cathodes and metal oxide interlayers exhibits a remarkable improvement in both cycliability and rate capability (range: C/10-5C) vis a vis the cell without any interlayer.

The highly dispersed Li+-conductive carbon (PANC@BP) was prepared by coating the high specific surface BP2000 with 10% polyacrylonitrile pyrolysis carbon. A composite sulfur electrode with a solid-solid reaction mechanism was constructed by dispersing PANC@BP into PAN/S composite. Electrochemical test results showed that the prepared PANC@BP had a realizable capacity of 50 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles with a voltage interval of 1.0-3.0 V at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). Based on the total mass of the composite material, the initial reversible specific capacity of the PANC@BP/PAN/S composite electrode was 745 mAh g(-1), maintained 701 mAh g(-1) after 80 cycles, indicating an excellent cycling stability and a high reversible specific capacity. With oxidized beta-cyclodextrin as binder and copper foil as the collecting conductor, the cycling performance of PANC@BP/PAN/S composite electrode had been significantly improved. The discharge specific capacity maintained 661 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles. Compared with discharge specific capacity of 948 mAh g(-1) in the first cycle, electrode capacity retention was 72.0%, and compared with the reversible discharge specific capacity in the second cycle, the retention was 95.1%.

The high sulfur content in the composite can be obtained from the carbon matrix, which has a high surface area and high electrical conductivity. Activated carbon made from biomass waste can be used as a carbon matrix due to its high surface area and ease of synthesis. In this study, activated carbon was prepared from water hyacinth (ACWH-600), which was carbonized at a temperature of 600 & DEG;C with a ZnCl2 activator. Activated-carbon-sulfur composite (ACWH-600/S) was synthesized by mixing activated carbon and sulfur in a ratio of 1:3. The characterizations performed for ACWH-600 and ACWH-600/S were N2 desorption-adsorption to determine the surface area, SEM to determine surface morphology, XRD to determine graphite structure, thermogravimetric analysis test to determine the sulfur content in the composite, and four-line probe conductivity to measure electrical conductivity at room temperature. The surface area, total pore volume, and pore diameter of ACWH were 642.39 m(2) g(-1), 0.714 cm(3) g(-1), and 2.22 nm, respectively, while the surface area, total pore volume, and pore diameter of ACWH-600/S were 29.431 m(2) g(-1), 0.038 cm(3) g(-1), and 2.54 nm. The conductivity value of ACWH-600 was 3.93 x 10(-2) S/cm, while for ACWH-600/S, the conductivity value was 2.24 x 10(-4) S/cm. The decrease in conductivity value after activated carbon added sulfur indicated the success of synthesizing a carbon matrix from water hyacinth with high sulfur content. The high sulfur content of 58 wt%, together with the acceptable conductivity value of composite ACWH-600/S, provide an opportunity to apply these composites as cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Practically, however, a pure S electrode encounters low deliverable capacity and poor charge/discharge cycle life owing to S's electrical insulation and problems associated with polysulfide dissolution. Here, we report our studies to couple S with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) prepared via either mechanical milling or chemical precipitation. The differences of the resulting rGO/S composites with respect tomorphology, structure, composition, and phase transformations are extensively studied. Thermal analyses, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopic results on the chemical rGO/S consistently confirmed the existence of amorphous/nanocrystalline S and their homogeneous distribution as well as interaction with the rGO microstructure. The electrochemical performances of chemical rGO/S revealed a marked improvement in both capacity retention and S utilization compared to those of the mechanical rGO/S.

However, the shuttle of polysulfides in conventional Li-S batteries with organic electrolyte results in severe problems, such as low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycling stability. Here, we developed a solid-state Li-S battery using Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3) (LAGP) solid ceramic electrolyte instead of liquid electrolyte. Lithium film was deposited on one side of LAGP by an evaporation method to improve the contact between anode and LAGP. Sulfur-coated Carbon nanotubes cathode (S-MWCNT) composition was casted on the other side of LAGP as the cathode and a small amount of ionic liquid was dropped in order to improve the ionic conductivity. This battery exhibited a high capacity of 1510 mAh g(-1) in the first cycle and retained 1400 mAh g(-1) after 30 cycles. Meanwhile, the Coulombic efficiency of the battery "was almost 100% for each cycle, which indicated the shuttle effect was circumvented completely.

However, the reduction reaction of element sulfur converts to the long-chain lithium polysulfide, which could soluble into the liquid electrolyte. As a result, the utilization of active sulfur materials is low, leading to a rapid capacity deceasing. Herein, the strategy of separator modification were used to introduce the mesoporous carbon hollow spheres impregnated with CoS2 into Li-S batteries. The CoS2 with polar groups provide chemical bonding sites for polysulfides. Meanwhile, the mesoporous carbon hollow spheres with large specific surface area served as the polysulfide trappers through strong physical affinity. Owing to the synergetic effects of physical and chemical interaction, the prepared composite could efficiently hinder the shuttle effect, which is the soluble polysulfides shuttling between the anode and cathode. Therefore, Li-S batteries with modified separators exhibit highly reversible capacity of 651 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0 C and superior rate capability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Non-woven carbon paper as current collector for Li-ion/Li2S system: Understanding of the first charge mechanism	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						lithium sulfur batteries; Li2S positive electrode; non-woven carbon current collector; GITT; initial charge mechanism	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; IN-SITU; CATHODE MATERIALS; SHUTTLE; PARTICLES; ION	The use of porous 3D current collectors, especially carbon-based ones, has already been demonstrated as a concept of choice as alternative to standard 2D aluminium foil in sulfur positive electrodes. In this study, we investigated non-woven carbon (NwC) as a 3D current collector for Li2S positive electrodes. Improved charge and discharge capacities, and capacity retention were obtained, as compared with electrodes containing Al-foil current collector. However, irrespective of the current collector used, the initial charge presents a particular and weakly reproducible voltage shape. By applying GITT and XRD measurements an electrochemical mechanism was proposed to explain the initial charge profile, in terms of equilibrium potential and polarization phenomenon. During the 1st charge, competitive oxidation reactions can be evoked involving both Li2S and long polysulfide intermediates (Li2Sn), in the main part of the charge process. While the oxidation of Li2S is thermodynamically favorable over the oxidation of Li2Sn, the kinetics of the latter is much more rapid. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, N-doped porous graphitic carbon with bound VN nanocrystals (3D VN@N-PGC), which is synthesized in one pot by heating a mixture of glucose as C source, urea as N source, and NH4VO3 as V source, is reported to be an superior electrocatalytic cathode host for Li-S batteries. Notably, the VN nanocrystals, strongly bound to the N-PGC network, form via in situ reactions among the thermolytic products of starting materials. The dopant N atoms and bound VN nanocrystals exhibit synergistic electrocatalytic effects to promote the cathode reactions of the Li-S cells. The observed enhancements are supported by density functional theory simulations and by the observation of electrocatalytic N- and V-intermediate species, via X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. Li-S cells assembled using 3D VN@N-PGC as cathode host exhibit superior performance in terms of specific capacity (1442 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C), rate capability (641 mA h g(-1) at 4 C), and cycle life (466 mA h g(-1) after 1700 cycles at 2 C, corresponding to a capacity decay of 0.020% per cycle). The one-pot methodology is facile and scalable and offers a new approach for synthesis of various metal nitride-containing materials for other electrocatalytic applications.

However, some disadvantages, including low electrical conductivity, poor sulfur utilization, and rapid capacity fading, obstruct its practical application. In this work, 3D carbon foam from a melamine resin is synthesized via high-temperature calcination. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and MnO2 are utilized to tailor the properties of the 3D cathode collector in the liquid Li2S6-containing Li-S battery without additional conductive agents, binders, and aluminum foil. Herein, the decorated MnO2 on the carbon fiber foam prolongs the lifespan of the Li-S battery, and adding CNTs is beneficial to enhance the capacity and cyclic performance of the Li-S battery under high sulfur loading. The Li-S battery with a sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2) possesses a reversible capacity of 437.9 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 0.1 C.

A combination of carbon and transition metal oxides is the best option for mitigating both of these shortcomings simultaneously. In this work, we use hydrothermally-tailored gamma-MnO2 nanorods combined with an activated biomass-derived carbon, which is an inexpensive material and easy to prepare. This strategy was also followed for a AC/MnO2/S composite, a preparation of which was made by grinding; this is the simplest method for practical applications. More complex procedures for the formation of in situ hydrothermal MnO2 nanorods gave similar results to those obtained from grinding. Compared with the AC/S composite, the presence of MnO2 markedly increased the delivered capacity and improved the cycling stability at both low (0.1 C) and high (1 C) currents. This behavior results from a combination of two main effects: firstly, the MnO2 nanorods increase the electrical conductivity of the electrode, and secondly, the small particle size of the oxide can enhance the chemisorption properties and facilitate a redox reaction with polysulphides, more efficiently blocking their dissolution in the electrolyte.

However, the volume-change and poor conductivity of S, and shuttle effect severely restrict applications. Here, we present a novel semispherical composite consisting of sulfur and polyaniline (PANI) hydrogel coating on a bowl-shaped hollow TiO2. The TiO2@PANI@S composites show an excellent performance with a high capacity of 1058 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, and a stable Columbic efficiency of 99.8%. The composites also possess a recoverable rate-performance under repeated tests. The Li+ ion diffusion co-efficiency is studied, which indicates that the semispherical composite enables a rapid Li+ ion transportation. In addition, the density functional theory calculations confirm a strong adsorption of TiO2 towards polysulfides including for Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8, which efficiently suppress the shuttle effect.

The highly electrically conductive activated carbon served as a pseudo current collector dramatically reducing the interface resistance and thus improved the reaction kinetics of the cell system. Furthermore, the mirco/ mesoporous structure and large pore volume of activated carbon provided an excellent environment to trap soluble polysulfide intermediates resulting in shuttle reaction and buffered the volume change of sulphur during cycling, prominently alleviating capacity fading. The cell with activated carbon coating layer maintained a high reversible specific capacity of 839.8 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.3 C (1 C = 1672 mA g(-1)), comparing to 496.7 mAh g(-1) of the cell with only pristine PP separator. Extended cycle life test exhibited a discharge capacity of 648 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles under 0.5 degrees C. Moreover, thickness influence of activated carbon coating layer indicated that a thin layer of 29 mu m coating was sufficient enough to improve the electrochemical performance of Li/S battery. Thicker coating was only able to slightly improve the performance of battery.

Many examples for their synthesis exist, but they generally show some common requirements, such as rigid reaction conditions, high cost and complicated multiple synthetic steps. Here we report a facile and cost-effective way to prepare porous carbon nanosheets by using an exfoliated nanopaper-like biomass, i.e., melaleuca bark as precursor. It is found that just after a simple carbonization treatment, the nanopaper-like barks can be directly transformed into two-dimensional carbon nanosheets with a unique hierarchical porous structure. A high BET surface area of 1397 m(2)/g can be reached for the obtained carbon materials without any extra activation process. Tuning of nanostructures could be facilely accomplished by varying carbonization treatment conditions. The as-prepared porous carbon nanosheet serves well as the sulfur host materials for lithium-sulfur battery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On the cathode side, the 3D conductive network structure of Ni@BNCNT is favorable for high sulfur utilization, and the collaboration between polar metal Ni nanoparticles (NPs) and doped B/N elements facilitates the chemical adsorption of Li polysulfides (LiPSs). In addition, these metal Ni NPs exhibit a satisfactory catalytic effect on the polysulfide conversion. Moreover, using the Ni@BNCNT interlayer can further capture the soluble LiPSs, make them convert quickly, and prevent them from diffusing toward the anode side. The Li-S batteries simultaneously equipped with a S/Ni@BNCNT cathode and Ni@BNCNT interlayer show high reversible capacity and good cycle stability. Additionally, even at a sulfur loading of 3.5 mg cm(-2) and an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 3 mu L mg(-1), excellent battery performance can be achieved. We believe that this work offers a new strategy based on combining a catalytic host and separator coating to construct high efficiency Li S batteries.

Battery-powered transportation is being adopted more frequently due to its potential to enable a more sustainable society by reducing vehicle emissions from fossil fuels. There has been exponential growth in the need for high-capacity LIBs in all types of EVs, including hybrid and full electric automobiles, e-bikes, and drones, as well as electric tools, cell phones, tablets, and, more recently, house storage; this growth significantly increases the consumption of source material commodities, especially cobalt. Despite its drop in price in the last couple of years due to increased mining, cobalt remains expensive, and its price increase has gained momentum again compared to other electrode materials due to higher demand. Moreover, its toxicity and difficult mining practices could result in many problems, including excessive carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emission along with a possible much higher demand in the long term. This provides a strong motivation to explore alternatives to battery source materials. In this article, we present a selection of our important works on LIBs, with a focus on alternative electrode chemistries by using abundant and sustainable material sources. As alternatives to traditional graphite-based anodes, we demonstrate the successful use of both silicon electrodes derived from beach sand and waste glass and carbon electrodes derived from portobello mushroom and waste plastic precursors. In addition, we demonstrate stable cycling of batteries with nonconventional electrode chemistries, such as lithium-sulfur with TiO2-coated sulfur electrodes and sulfur-silicon full cell batteries with integrated lithium sources. Batteries prepared by sustainable methods not only perform better than conventional ones but also result in reduced costs. Since accurate determination of battery state of health is another important challenge, we further present our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis of LIBs, which could potentially be utilized in safety evaluations of current and next-generation LIBs.

Nevertheless, less attention is paid to the investigation of the influence of in-plane carbon lattice defect on the catalytic activity and selectivity toward ORR. In the present work, graphene precursors were prepared from oxo-functionalized graphene (oxo-G) and graphene oxide (GO) with H2O2 hydrothermal treatment, respectively. Statistical Raman spectroscopy (SRS) analysis demonstrated the increased in-plane carbon lattice defect density in the order of oxo-G, oxo-G/H2O2, GO, GO/H2O2. Furthermore, nitrogen-doped graphene materials were prepared through ammonium hydroxide hydrothermal treatment of those graphene precursors. Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) results indicate that the nitrogen-doped graphene derived from oxo-G with lowest in-plane carbon lattice defects exhibited the highest H2O2 selectivity of >82% in 0.1 M KOH.

Nevertheless, the severe "shuttle effects" of lithium polysulfides have markedly limited the performance of the cells and further hindered their commercial applications. Herein, a novel scheme combining a transformation strategy with ammonia treatment was developed to fabricate ZIF-8-derived nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon (NHPC/NH3). When NHPC/NH3 was used as a host of sulfur, the obtained S@NHPC/NH3 cathode for Li-S cells presented an initial specific capacity of 1654 mA h g(-1) and an outstanding cycling stability with only 0.27% attenuation per cycle from the 30th cycle to 130th cycle. Together with the theoretical calculation, it was concluded that such excellent electrochemical performances should be attributed to the suppressed "shuttle effect" via both physical and chemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides in the optimized microporous structures with effective nitrogen doping sites as well as the improved kinetics owing to the abundant meso/macroporous structures.

The presence of chemically bound sulfur (90 wt%) utilising cardanol (10 wt%) derivative in the copolymer (S90) showed a reduction in the active material dissolution into the electrolyte. In addition, the organic sulfur units get dispersed into the insoluble/insulating Li-2 S-2/Li2S phase and thus found to suppress their irreversible dep-osition. Li-S battery based on S90/multi-walled carbon nano-tubes (MWCNT) (10 wt%) exhibited a reversible capacity of 1302 mAh g(-1) at 2nd cycle, maintaining a high reversible capacity of 928 mAh g(-1) after 70 cycles at a relatively constant coulombic efficiency over 99% at current rate of 200 mA g(-1). At 1000 mA g(-1) current rate, the composite cathode delivered a reversible capacity of 697 mAh g(-1) at 2nd cycle and retained 75% of its initial capacity even after 180 cycles.

J	Sun, K; Wu, Q; Tong, X; Gan, H				Sun, Ke; Wu, Qin; Tong, Xiao; Gan, Hong			Electrolyte with Low Polysulfide Solubility for Li-S Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						Li-S battery; electrolyte; polysulfide solubility; high C/O ratio ether; solvation structure; long cycle life	LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; SULFUR; PERFORMANCE; ETHER	Li-S battery is one of the most promising next-generation rechargeable battery technologies because of its high theoretical energy density and low material cost. However, its success is impeded by the low energy efficiency and fast capacity fade primarily caused by the discharge intermediates, Li-polysulfides (PS), dissolution in the electrolyte. Mitigation of PS dissolution in electrolyte involves the search for a new electrolyte solvent system that exhibits poor solvation to the PS while still having good solvation ability to the electrolyte salt for high ionic conductivity. Applying cosolvents with reduced solvating power but compatible with the state of the art Li-S battery's ether-based electrolyte is one of the most promising concepts. This route is also advantageous of having a low scale-up cost. With the aid of quantum chemical calculation, we have identified high carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio ethers as cosolvent in the new electrolytes that effectively impede PS dissolution while still maintaining high ionic conductivity. Significantly improved cycle life and cycling Coulombic efficiency are observed for Li-S cells using the new composite electrolytes. Anode analysis with different methods also demonstrate that reducing electrolyte's PS solubility results in less sulfur total amount on the lithium anode surface and lower ratio of the longer-chain PS, which is probably a sign of suppressed side reactions between the anode and PS in the electrolyte.

To suppress the shuttling effect of dissolved lithium polysulfides, different mass ratios petal-like nickel hydroxide nanosheets (NHN) decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) materials are synthesized in this study using a one-step hydrothermal method and applied modified separators in Li-S batteries. With up to 73.5 wt% of sulfur content in the cathode, the optimized sample (the mass ratio of graphene oxide to nickel nitrate is 1:9) enables discharge capacities up to 1579 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C (the areal sulfur loading is 5 mg cm(-2)). The cell also exhibits a retention of 840 mAh g(-1) in specific capacity after 200 cycles, exhibiting higher utilizations and better cycling stabilities for Li-S batteries. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that NHN plays a critical role in promoting the redox reaction kinetics of Li-S batteries, and the high conductivity of rGO enhances the electrochemical function of NHN. This study provides a low cost approach for the developments of modified separators in future practical Li-S batteries.

Therefore, in this work, hollow carbon spheres loaded with NiSe2 nano plates were prepared as SeS2 hosts for Li-SeS2 batteries. The unique micro-mesoporous hollow carbon spheres not only provide channels for the diffusion of SeS2, but also afford spaces for alleviating the volume expansion of the active substance. Besides, the external polar NiSe2 nanoplates increase active sites for capturing polysulfides or polyselenides during the charge/discharge process. Meanwhile, the excellent electronic conductivity of NiSe2 can accelerate the catalytic reaction on the surface, thus reducing the loss of soluble intermediate products and finally suppressing the "shuttle effect". These extraordinary features of the as-proposed cathode offer many superiorities in electrochemical performances in terms of a high initial discharge capacity of 1139 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 0.1C and an excellent cycling life of up to 1000 cycles at 1C.

HNCM possesses a hierarchically porous architecture and high-content N-doping. In particular, HNCM800 (HNCM pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C) shows high nitrogen content of 12.43 at%. The porous structure derived from well-interconnected CNTs not only offers a highly conductive network and blocks diffusion of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in physical adsorption, but also allows sufficient sulfur infiltration. The incorporation of N-rich CNTs provides strong chemical immobilization for LiPSs. As a sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries, good rate capability and high cycling stability is achieved for HNCM/S cathodes. Particularly, the HNCM800/S cathode delivers a high capacity of 804 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C after 1000 cycles corresponding to low fading rate (FR) of only 0.011% per cycle. Remarkably, the cathode with high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm(-2) still maintains high cyclic stability (capacity of 555 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles, FR 0.038%). Additionally, CNT/Co3O4 microspheres are obtained by the oxidation of CNTs/Co in the air. The as-prepared CNT/Co3O4 microspheres are employed as an anode for lithium-ion batteries and present excellent cycling performance.

Sulfur Cathodes with Carbon Current Collector for Li-S cells	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							COMPOSITE CATHODES; PERFORMANCE; NANOTUBES; BATTERIES	Li-S cells have a low voltage (similar to 2.1 V), but their potentially high energy density (200-500 Wh/kg) makes them a promising system for next generation batteries. To obtain high energy densities on cell level, the weight fraction and load of the active material should be as high as possible, while inactive material is reduced to a minimum. Conventionally, sulfur slurry cathodes with an aluminum current collector are used. However, binder-free CNT-coated carbon structures are a promising method of achieving higher loads and higher ratios of active material. Using a specially designed test cell it was demonstrated that sulfur cathodes without a metal current collector can deliver enough power to meet the requirements of consumer electronics at simultaneously high capacities of up to 600 mAh g(-1) for the entire electrode and current collector. A literature study compared various equivalent circuits used for Li-S electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and enabled the selection of the most suitable one for the system used here. EIS measurements during charge and discharge delivered vital information about the specific resistances of the sulfur cathodes with a carbon current collector. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

The structures, ionic conductivities and electrochemical stabilities of the 70Li(2)S center dot(30 - x) P2S5 center dot xSeS(2) (x = 0, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 3, 5) glass-ceramic electrolytes are investigated. By combining X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis-refinement and first-principle calculations, it is confirmed that a little amount of SeS2 (x <= 1) can be successfully doped into the framework of LPS composite, and as such, the ionic conductivity can be greatly enhanced by the substitution of a part of P2S5 with SeS2. In particular, the 70Li(2)S center dot 29P(2)S(5)center dot 1SeS(2) glass-ceramic exhibits the highest conductivity of 5.28 x 10(-3) S.cm(-1) at 20 degrees C with a low activation energy of 24.7 kJ.mo1(-1), and higher electrochemical stability than the original 70Li(2)S center dot 30P(2)S(5) glass-ceramic. Furthermore, all-solid-state battery assembled based on 70Li(2)S center dot 29P(2)S(5)center dot 1SeS(2) electrolyte and sulfur-reduced graphene oxide (S-rGO) composite electrode shows excellent rate capability and cycling stability at low temperatures. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses and the cross-section observe by scanning electron microscope (SEM) of all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries reveal that addition of SeS2 into the Li2S-P2S5 electrolyte substrate can decrease the interfacial resistance between the electrodes and solid electrolyte and reduce the production of lithium dendrites. These results indicate that 70Li(2)S center dot 29P(2)S(5)center dot 1SeS(2) electrolyte can be served as an effective solid electrolyte for the construction of high performance all-solid-state batteries.

The theoretical capacity of the S cathode is 10 times higher than that of conventional cathode materials used in current Li-ion batteries. However, Li-S batteries suffer from the dissolution of lithium polysulfides, which are formed by the redox reaction at the S cathode. Herein, we present simple solvate ionic liquids, glyme-Li salt molten complexes, as excellent electrolyte candidates because they greatly suppress the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. The molten complexes do not readily dissolve other ionic solutes, which leads to the stable operation of the Li-S battery over more than 400 cycles with discharge capacities higher than 700 mAh g-sulfur(-1) and with coulombic efficiencies higher than 98% throughout the cycles. Such high performance has not been realized to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, the addition of a nonflammable fluorinated solvent, which does not break the solvate structure of the glyme-Li salt molten complexes, greatly enhances the power density of the Li-S battery. The strategic design of electrolyte properties provides opportunities for the development of new electrochemical devices with many different electrode materials. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Transition metal oxides are suitable chemical anchor matrix as Lewis acid coordinated with sulfur atoms in the form of Lewis base. Ion bonds may also be formed between anions in transition metal compounds and lithium ions in lithium polysulfides alleviating the shuttle effect. Reducing their crystal sizes to expose more surface active sites and expand surface areas is pivotal to sufficiently immobilize polysulfides. Here, an optimized GFM-2 composite was fabricated, where the 20 nm metal oxide particles aggregated by the 3-5 nm Fe2O3 and Mn3O4 binary crystals are uniformly distributed on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets. A high specific surface area up to 144.9 m(2) g(-1) was obtained for the GFM-2. The modified sulfur@rGO (S@G) cathode obtained by mixing S@G and GFM-2 additive with the mass ratio of 20: 1, presented high specific discharge capacities of 1356.3 and 770.2 mAh g(-1) , respectively, at scan rates of 0.1 and 5C (1C = 1675 mAh g(-1)) under conventional electrolyte dosage with electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) = 30 mL g((s))(-1). and sulfur loading of 1.1 mg cm(-2). The capacity was 1053.5 mAh g(-1) at 1C and maintained at 530.1 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles with the low average capacity decay rate of each cycle of 0.049%. Under low electrolyte dosages of E/S = 15 and 8 mL g((s))(-1) the high capacities of 1308.0 and 1230.4 mAh g(-1) could be still obtained at 0.1C, respectively. When the sulfur loading was increased to 2.8 mg cm(-2) and E/S was reduced to 10 mL g((s))(-1), the good capacity of 1163.6 mAh g(-1) was gotten at 0.1C. The high capacity and high cyclic property under different E/S and sulfur loading amounts indicate the potential for practical application of this simple but effective modified sulfur cathode.

Here, we demonstrate a metal current collector-free, binder-free, flexible sulfurized polyacrylonitrile film electrode with hollow tubular nanofibers (H-SPAN), which is fabricated via coaxial electrospinning and a simple heat treatment. The all-fibrous films H-SPAN not only provides three-dimensional continuous electron and ion transport paths, but also suppresses the shuttle effect, contributing to better redox kinetics, cycling performance, and flexibility. The H-SPAN film electrode delivers a high specific lithium storage capacity of 1250 mAh g(-1) (sulfur) or 514.75 mAh g(-1) electrode at 0.1C with stable cycling over 300 cycles. Additionally, when H-SPAN is applied as a cathode for room temperature Na-S batteries, it also exhibits superb capacity and cycling stability (717 mAh g(-1) (sulfur) or 295.2 mAh g(-1) (electrode) at 0.1C after 200 cycles).

After that, the Fe3C nanosheets/sulfur (FCNSs/S) composites as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries are also synthesized via heating method. The as-prepared FCNSs materials have many advantages, including high electronic conductivity, abundant mesoporous structure, and high specific surface area. Besides, the FCNSs could form chemical affinity for the soluble polysulfide. Due to these above advantages, the poor electronic conductivity and polysulfide migration in lithium-sulfur batteries could be improved and inhibited. As a result, the as-prepared FCNSs/S composite cathodes deliver high initial specific discharge capacity of 1396 mAh/g at 0.1 C rate and an excellent long cycle stability at 2 C rate. These outstanding electrochemical performances make the FCNSs/S composites as an excellent candidate for lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this study, a hybrid rGO/CNTs aerogel embedding FeP nanocubes is fabricated by instantly freezing and phosphorizing metal organic frameworks (MOF)-containing precursors, and used as the LPSB cathodes for hosting polysulfides with high affinity. A high specific capacity of 1312.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and prolonged cycling with only 0.037% decay per cycle at 1 C were achieved for over 500 cycles, together with an exceptional high areal capacity up to 8.5 mA h cm(-2) at the sulfur loading of 9.6 mg cm(-2). This remarkable LPSB performance is ascribed to the strong immobilization of polysulfides by the FeP anchoring material, the conductive and microporous carbon scaffolds in providing adequate interfaces for charge transfer, the homogeneous catholyte distribution for promoting sulfur utilization, as well as a possible catalytic effect of FeP on expediting the redox conversion of polysulfides.

Here, the authors propose a polyoxometalate/multilayer graphene composite as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for battery performance improvement. The redox reactions occurring in the Li-S battery positive electrode conceal various and critical electrocatalytic processes, which strongly influence the performances of this electrochemical energy storage system. Here, we report the development of a single-dispersed molecular cluster catalyst composite comprising of a polyoxometalate framework ([Co-4(PW9O34)(2)](10-)) and multilayer reduced graphene oxide. Due to the interfacial charge transfer and exposure of unsaturated cobalt sites, the composite demonstrates efficient polysulfides adsorption and reduced activation energy for polysulfides conversion, thus serving as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. When tested in full Li-S coin cell configuration, the composite allows for a long-term Li-S battery cycling with a capacity fading of 0.015% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 2 C (i.e., 3.36 A g(-1)). An areal capacity of 4.55 mAh cm(-2) is also achieved with a sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm(-)(2) and E/S ratio of 4.5 mu L mg(-1). Moreover, Li-S single-electrode pouch cells tested with the bifunctional electrocatalyst demonstrate a specific capacity of about 800 mAh g(-1) at a sulfur loading of 3.6 mg cm(-2) for 100 cycles at 0.2 C (i.e., 336 mA g(-1)) with E/S ratio of 5 mu L mg(-1).

However, the commercial promotion of LSBs is hindered by the irreversible capacity decay and short cycling life caused by the shuttle effect of lithium-polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, a hybrid interlayer consisting of MoO3, conductive Ni foam, and Super P is prepared to prevent the shuttle effect and catalyze the LiPSs conversion. MoO3 with a reversible lithiation/delithiation behavior between Li0.042MoO3 and Li2MoO4 within 1.7-2.8 V versus Li/Li+ combines the Li+ insertion and LiPSs immobilization and efficiently improve the LSBs redox kinetics. Benefiting from the reversible Li+ insertion/extraction in lithium molybdate (LixMoOy) and the highly conductive Ni foam substrate, the sulfur cathode coupled with such electrochemical activation derived catalytic interlayer exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1100.1 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 C with a low decay rate of 0.09% cycle(-1). Good capacity retention can still be obtained even the areal sulfur loading is increased to 13.28 mg cm(-2).

However, it fails to inhibit the polysulfide migration during the electrochemical reactions. As a result, the functional separators must be developed for inhibiting the shuttle effect of the soluble polysulfide. In our work, nano fibrous separator is prepared and used as the efficient barrier for the polysulfide migration. The PSA separator is fabricated by electrospinning method, using polysulfonamide membrane as the functional separator in the lithium-sulfur batteries. The electrochemical result shows that the initial specific capacity of the PSA separator is as high as 1506 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 0.05 C. The PSA separator shows capacity of 1052 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 C.

Loading of 60 wt% Se-S mixed active material in carbon spheres using a two step infusion method exhibits crystalline nature, whereas single step infusion method yields amorphous product. Interestingly, Se and S involve in the electrochemical reaction with Li. Among the products, 60 wt% Se-S loaded carbon spheres from a two step infusion method effectively suppresses the active material against shuttling and retains about 528 and 387 mAh/g of capacity at C/10 and 1C rate respectively due to the better electronic conductivity and polar nature of similar to 5% nitrogen present in the carbon sphere. Further, Se-S@carbon sphere cathode demonstrates better electrochemical performance than S or Se@carbon sphere cathodes. The study deals with the effect of mixed active material loaded carbon spheres and the role of infusion method in improving the electrochemical behaviour of Li-S system both individually and in synergy.

The fibers are constituted with hollow graphitized carbon spheres formed using catalytic Ni nano-particles as hard templates. Sulfur is loaded to the carbon substrates via thermal vaporization. The structure and composition of the hierarchical carbon fiber/S composite are characterized with X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption isotherms. The electrochemical performance is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The results exhibit an initial discharge capacity of 845 mA h g(-1) at 0.25 C (420 mA g(-1)), with a retention of 77% after 100 cycles. A discharge capacity of 533 mA h g(-1) is still attainable when the rate is up to 1.0 C. The good cycling performance and rate capability are contributed to the uniform dispersion of sulfur, the conductive network of carbon fibers and hollow graphitized carbon spheres.

Building chemical bonds between inorganic active materials and nanocarbon substrates is the key to controlled hybrid material synthesis that allows for controlling the size and morphology of the materials and enhancing electron transport within the electrodes. Our inorganic/nanocarbon hybrid materials manifest superior electrochemical performance for asymmetrical supercapacitors, ultrafast nickel-iron batteries, lithium ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy has been utilized to characterize the chemical bonding and charge transfer at the interface of inorganic nanocrystals and nanocarbon substrates. Probing the physical and chemical states of the hybrid materials under electrochemical reaction conditions is an important future direction in this area.

The as-prepared samples have different levels of nitrogen contents and pore structure. These sulfur hosting matrix materials are designed to systematically elaborate the effect of N-doping level and pore structure on the electrochemical performance of the S/NDPC nanocomposites. The higher volume ratio of marco-mesopores to micropores of the substrate can greatly enhance the rate capability of the S/NDPC cathodes. This is attributed to the improved electrolyte penetration via the rich marco-mesopores. Meanwhile, the higher nitrogen content of the NDPC contributes to improving the cycle stability of the S/NDPC cathode, which is assigned to the strong chemical adsorption and physical restriction of polysulfides by the interaction of nitrogen atom and polysulfides. Therefore, the S/NDPC-1 cathode, prepared by using a NDPC matrix with high nitrogen content, large specific surface area, and a moderate microporous volume percentage (V-Micro/V-T), displays an obvious enhancement in the electrochemical performance. It exhibits specific capacities of 926.1 and 815.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 and 1.0 C rate, respectively, with a capacity fading rate of only 0.067% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1.0 C.

However, with the development of next-generation lithium batteries, Al current collectors face new challenges, such as the requirement of increased chemical stability at high voltage, long-cycle-life batteries with different electrolyte systems, as well as improved electronic conductivity and adhesion for new electrode materials. In this study, we demonstrate a novel graphene-like carbon (GLC) coating on the Al foil in lithium-based batteries. Various physical and electrochemical characterizations are conducted to reveal the electronic conductivity and electrochemical stability of the GLC-Al foil in both carbonate- and ether-based electrolytes. Full-cell tests, including Li-S batteries and high-voltage Li-ion batteries, are performed to demonstrate the significantly improved cycling and rate performance of batteries with the use of the GLC-Al foil as current collectors. The cell using the GLC-Al foil can greatly reduce the potential polarization in Li-S batteries and can obtain a reversible capacity of 750 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.5C. Even with high-sulfur-loading cathodes, the Li-S battery at 1C still maintains over 500 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles. In high-voltage Li-ion batteries, the GLC-Al foil significantly improves the high-rate performance, showing an increased retained capacity by over 100 mAh g(-1) after 450 cycles at 1C compared to the bare foil. It is believed that the developed GLC-Al foil brings new opportunities to enhance the battery life of lithium-based batteries.

Herein, we report a facile and eco-friendly one-pot strategy for the chemical reduction of graphene oxide and recombination of sulphur as the cathode material for a Li-S battery. The optimized rGO/S-3 composite material possesses a porous morphology with pore walls made of the rGO and sulphur composite. The sulphur content is about 73.5 wt%, the particle size is about 8-15 nm, and the particles are distributed evenly on the layer of rGO, wherein the thickness of rGO is about 3-4 nm, corresponding to 8-10 monolayer graphenes. The rGO/S-3 composite electrode presents a high initial discharge capacity of 1012 and 474 mA h g(-1) at 1C and 10C, respectively. The discharge capacity of 451 mA h g(-1) was preserved after 1200 cycles at 1C. Even though the current density increased to 10C, a discharge capacity of 237 mA h g(-1) may be obtained after 400 cycles.

The MWCNTs act as conductive skeleton for physical confinement of S and the PEI can chemically immobilize the S/lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from synergistic effects of the multifunctional host, the cathode can load with high S and simultaneously achieves excellent reversible capacity and outstanding rate performance. For instance, the capacity remains around 500 mAh g(-1) even after 350 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1) with a capacity decay of only 0.12% per cycle.

Herein, we develop a bi-functional cathode substrate for Li-S batteries made of well-distributed boron carbide nanoparticles decorated activated cotton fiber (B4C-ACF), in which B4C nanoparticles serve as not only robust chemically anchoring sites to trap the polysulfides, but also afford abundant active sites for efficient sulfur conversion reactions. Meanwhile, the ACF network provides fast electron pathways for the conversion reactions and acts as the current collector. As a result, the novel cathode substrate enables a Li-S battery to deliver an initial capacity of as high as 1415 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, and an extrahigh reversible capacity of 928 mAh g(-1) at 3 C with an areal sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm(-2). More strikingly, the B4C-ACF substrate-based battery could be stably operated for 3000 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of 99.24% and a capacity decay rate of as low as 0.012% per cycle at 1 C, demonstrating that the B4C-ACF substrate holds great potential in realizing the mass production of advanced Li-S batteries.

This simple method overcomes the difficulty of low doping content as well as the existence of an uncontrolled form of nitrogen heteroatom in the final product. Besides the conventional pyridinic N-Li bond formed in the vacancies of g-C3N4, the C-S bond was interestingly observed between g-C3N4 and Li2S, which endowed g-C3N4 with an inherent adsorption capacity for polysulfides. In addition, the microsized g-C3N4 provided the coating layer with good mechanical strength to guarantee its restriction function for polysulfides during long cycling. As a result, an excellent reversible capacity of 840 mA h g(-1) was retained at 0.5 C after 400 cycles for a pure sulfur electrode, much better than that of the cell with an innocent carbon-coated separator. Even at a current density of 1 C, the cell still delivered a stable capacity of 732.7 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles. Moreover, when further increasing the sulfur loading to 5 mg cm(-2), an excellent specific capacity of 1134.7 mA h g(-1) was acquired with the stable cycle stability, ensuring a high areal capacity of 5.11 mA h cm(-2). Besides the intrinsic adsorption ability for polysulfides, g-C3N4 is nontoxic and mass produced. Therefore, a scalable separator decorated with g-C3N4 and a commercial sulfur cathode promises high energy density for the practical application of Li-S batteries.

The development of low-cost substitute of graphene is thus highly desired to meet the practical demand of upcoming applications where extremely physical properties are not absolutely critical. In this work, a top-down strategy for general synthesis of 3D carbon nanosheet frameworks decorated with metal nanoparticles by a metal nitrate-assisted polymer-blowing process is reported. Such architecture provides a promising structural platform for the fabrication of carbon nanosheet frameworks functionalized with metal oxide or carbon hollow nanostructures through subsequent chemical conversion. The unique structures impart intimate structural interconnectivities, highly opened freeway for ionic diffusion, large accessible surface area, as well as high structural stability, opening up a wide horizon for electrochemical applications, for example, high-energy, long-life lithium-ion batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries highlighted in this work.

This carbon contains abundant micropores, possessing a large BET surface area of 1066 m(2) g(-1) and total pore volume of 0.62 cm(3) g(-1) with an average pore size of 2.33 nm, which can enhance the adsorption of polysulfides and sulfur by capillary force. The treated carbon is used to synthesize a wheat straw carbon (WSC)/S composite as the cathode of Li-S batteries for the first time. The WSC/S composite with 74 wt% sulfur content exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1213 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)) with coulombic efficiency of 95% and a superior rate capability. Even when cycling at 1C, the first and the 200th specific discharge capacity of 582 mA h g(-1) and 445 mA h g(-1) are retained, respectively, along with a low fading rate of 0.11% per cycle, which suggests that the WSC/S composite could be a type of promising material for cathodes of Li-S batteries.

Therefore, it is urgent to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery via improving the polysulfide migration and inhibit the polysulfide shuttle effect. In this study, carbon nanofiber/MnO(2)composites are prepared and designed as host materials for sulfur. Due to the synthetic effect of high electronic conductivity and strong adsorption for polysulfide, the as-prepared carbon nanofiber/MnO2@S (CNF/MO@S) composites exhibit initial high specific capacity of 1286 mAh g(-1)at 0.1 C. Besides, the CNF/MO@S composites show specific capacity of 786 mAh g(-1)after 200 cycles at 2 C.

It is stationary and does not change during the entire operation once it is built. The interface of this matrix and an electrode is constructed at a 2D level at the micro-scale, and naturally limits the breadth and depth of electrochemical reactions. Herein, the idea of an enhanced electrode coupled with a conducting molecule that can extend interfacial reactions is first introduced. With a spatialized interspace, this electrode can change the present understanding of the electrode process and opens up a new realm of electrode-based reaction chemistry. A lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is used as the target for implementing the enhanced electrode owing to the complex multi-electron reaction. Through the interaction of pi-pi stacking between graphite-based carbon and iron (II) phthalocyanine (FePc), soluble FePc can be decorated on the surface of an electrode that has the capability of transporting electrons. The scanning tunneling microscope break junction characterization and density functional theory indicate that FePc has a strong molecular electronic conductivity. The reactants obtain electrons more easily from the conducting molecule than from the collector directly. As a result, the performance of the corresponding Li-S battery considerably improves.

The influences of solvents, including ethanol and chloroform, on the structure and electrochemical performance of the composites are firstly investigated. As compared to the conventional dry-milling process, high loose structure and uniform distribution of sulfur can be obtained by adding ethanol during the ball-milling process, and significant enhancement of electrochemical performance is presented. At the current density of 800 mA g (1), the discharge capacity can be stably retained at 861.6 mAh g (1) after 150 cycles for the composite prepared by adding ethanol, showing obvious advantages over the dry-milling sample and the composite prepared by adding chloroform. When the current density increase to 1600 mA g (1), it can still demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 640.9 mAh g (1) after 200 cycles. Furthermore, the influence of ball-milling speed is also investigated, but a low utilization of sulfur active materials is obtained after high-energy ball milling process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this preparation, the hollow tracheids are chemically isolated from oil palm shells, further heat-treated at 400 degrees C for carbonization and then calcined at 800 degrees C with KOH/K2CO3 for activation. In Li-S batteries, the as-prepared HPHCMs are loaded with 60 wt% sulfur to form the cathode material, which delivers an initial specific capacity of 1105 mA h g(-1) and a high capacity retention of 74%, even after 100 cycles. Thus, this investigation provides a facile method for preparing hierarchical porous hollow carbon microstructures from plant tracheids, which can be applied excellently as electrode materials.

Physicochemical interactions underlying the cathode microstructure evolution due to precipitation are hitherto poorly understood. In this work, a mesoscale understanding of the microstructure precipitate interplay owing to surface passivation and pore blockage is presented. Mesoporous, carbon-based cathode microstructures are examined for disparate precipitate morphology and growth. The pore-scale manifestation of the microstructural and transport limitations on the electrochemical performance is elucidated. Surface passivation and pore blockage effects are examined for complexations due to sulfur loading, electrolyte volume, pore, size, and precipitate morphology. This study provides critical insights into the underlying mesoscale physics and microstructural stochasticity on the Li-S battery performance.

While conventional wisdom mainly focuses on trapping polysulfides at the cathode using various functional materials, few strategies are available at present to fully resolve or circumvent this long-standing issue. In this study, we propose the concept of sulfur-equivalent cathode materials, and demonstrate the great potential of amorphous MoS3 as such a material for room-temperature Li-S and Na-S batteries. In Li-S batteries, MoS3 exhibits sulfur-like behavior with large reversible specific capacity, excellent cycle life, and the possibility to achieve high areal capacity. Most remarkably, it is also fully cyclable in the carbonate electrolyte under a relatively high temperature of 55 degrees C. MoS3 can also be used as the cathode material of even more challenging Na-S batteries to enable decent capacity and good cycle life. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments are carried out to track the structural evolution of MoS3. It largely preserves its chain-like structure during repetitive battery cycling without generating any free polysulfide intermediates.

A novel sulfur/polypyrrole/multi-walled carbon nanotube nanocomposite cathode with core-shell tubular structure for lithium rechargeable batteries	SOLID STATE IONICS			English	Article						Sulfur/polypyrrole/MWNT composite; Lithium-sulfur battery; Core-shell tubular structure	SULFUR BATTERIES; CONDUCTING POLYPYRROLE; COMPOSITES; POLYSULFIDES; PERFORMANCE; REDUCTION; STABILITY; CELLS	A multi-walled carbon nanotube and polypyrrole composite (PPy/MWNT) was synthesized by in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer on the surface of MWNT. As-prepared PPy/MWNT composite was mixed with an aqueous suspension of nanosized sulfur particle, followed by heat-treatment to obtain an S/PPy/MWNT ternary composite. High resolution transmission electronic microscopy shows the formation of a highly developed core-shell tubular structure consisting of PPy/MWNT composite with uniform sulfur coating on its surface. Polypyrrole, with its high adhesion ability to MWNT, acts as a binder to connect sulfur and MWNTs, as well as absorbs polysulfides into its porous structure to improve the cyclability of the S/PPy/MWNT composite in Li/S batteries. The MWNT core provides a highly conductive and mechanically flexible framework, enhancing the electronic conductivity and consequently the rate capability of the material. This ternary composite cathode sustains 960.7 mAh g(-1) reversible specific discharge capacity after 40 cycles at 0.1 C, and 523.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, inspired by the working principle of natural spider webs, we synthesized a spider-web-like nanocomposite in which many hollow mesoporous silica (mSiO(2)) nanospheres/Co nanoparticles were threaded by interconnected nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs). Then the nanocomposite (denoted as Co/mSiO(2) NCNTs) was coated on the commercial separator by a simple infiltration to mitigate the above issue. The intimate combination of three-dimensional conductive networks (NCNTs) with abundant polysulfide adsorbent sites (SiO2 and N)/polysulfide conversion catalysts (Co and Co N species) allows the Co/mSiO(2) NCNTs coating layer to not only effectively capture polysulfides via both physical confinement and chemical bonding but also accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides significantly. Furthermore, the combination of ex situ experiment and theoretical calculation demonstrates that the reversible adsorption/desorption of polysulfides on mSiO(2) nanospheres benefits uniform deposition of Li2S2/Li2S on the conductive networks, which contributes to long-term cycling stability. As a result, Li S batteries with Co/mSiO(2) NCNTs-coated separators exhibited both excellent cycling stability and rate performance.

Herein, the annealed melamine foam loaded MoSe2 (CF@MoSe2) is prepared by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. Tellurium-doped MoSe2 (CF@Te-MoSe2) is further fabricated by annealing treatment in order to improve the catalytic activity. As a multifunctional interlayer, the CF@Te-MoSe2 inhibits the shuttle effect, improves redox kinetics, and-discharge polarisation of Li-S batteries. Meanwhile, the batteries based on CF@Te-MoSe2 interlayer remain discharge capacity 901 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. Importantly, the batteries based on CF@Te-MoSe2 interlayer delivers high initial areal capacity of 5.7 mAh cm(-2) under high sulphur mass loading of 6.3 mg cm(-2).

However, shuttling of lithium polysulfide intermediates and sluggish kinetics in random deposition of lithium sulfide (Li2S) have significantly degraded their capacity, rate and cycling performance. Herein, few-layered MoS2 nanosheets enriched with sulfur vacancies are anchored inside hollow mesoporous carbon (MoS2-x/HMC) via S-C bonding and proposed as a novel functional mediator for Li-S batteries. Ultrathin MoS2 sheets with abundant sulfur vacancies have strong chemical affinity to polysulfides and in the meantime catalyze their fast redox conversion with enhanced reaction kinetics as proved by experimental observations and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At a current density of 1C, the MoS2-x/HMC-S composite cathode exhibits a high initial capacity of 945 mA h g(-1) with a high retained capacity of 526 mA h g(-1) and a coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% after 500 cycles. The present work sheds light on the design of novel functional electrodes for next-generation electrochemical cells based on a simple yet effective vacancy engineering strategy.

Here, we developed hierarchically structured porous, conductive, and multifunctional N-doped carbon (N-C) nanofibers comprising homogeneously dispersed vanadium nitride quantum dots and hollow N-C nanocages as functional interlayers for advanced LSBs. The freestanding interlayer contains well-developed long-range channels and numerous interconnected hollow N-C nanocages derived from the metal-organic framework. Furthermore, the presence of a N-C framework and vanadium nitride quantum dots measuring several nanometers improves the redox reaction kinetics and provides numerous chemisorption sites for the effective trapping and reuse of lithium polysulfide. As a result, the assembled Li-S cell employing the unique nanostructured freestanding interlayer exhibits superior rate capability and stable cycling performance (decay rate of 0.02% per cycle at 0.5C) considering the high sulfur content (80 wt%) and loading (ca. 4 mg cm(-2)) in the sulfur electrodes. Even with an ultra-high sulfur loading of 11.0 mg cm(-2), the Li-S cell delivered a stable areal capacity of 5.0 mA h cm(-2) after 100 charge-discharge cycles at 0.05C. Thus, the uniquely nanostructured interlayer shows high potential for the development of advanced LSBs utilizing pure sulfur electrodes with realistic battery parameters.

The membrane cathodes with aligned channels and hierarchically porous networks significantly promote Li+ and electron transportation and meanwhile trap soluble polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs) effectively via strong chemical adsorption of the doped Fe3C nanoparticles in the membrane toward LiPSs. We further demonstrated that five-layer membrane electrodes with high S loading of 7.1 mg cm(-2) were readily prepared via layer-by-layer stacking of the C/Fe3C membrane, which can deliver a high capacity of 726 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles, corresponding to an ultra-high-areal-capacity of 5.15 mA h cm(-2) at a low electrolyte/sulfur (EIS) ratio of 6.4 mu L, mg(-1). The scalable multifunctional membrane electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance under high-sulfur-loading and lean electrolyte conditions reveal its promising batteries.

Firstly, elemental sulfur is transformed into long-chain polysulfides (S8Li2S4), which are highly soluble in the electrolyte. Next, long-chain polysulfides undergo nucleation reaction and convert into solid-state Li2S2 and Li2S (Li2S4Li2S) by slow processes. As a result, the second-step of the electrochemical reaction hinders the high-rate application of Li-S batteries. In this report, the kinetics of the sulfur/long-chain-polysulfide redox couple (theoretical capacity=419mAhg-1) are experimentally demonstrated to be very fast in the Li-S system. A Li-S cell with a blended carbon interlayer retains excellent cycle stability and possesses a high percentage of active material utilization over 250cycles at high C rates. The meso-/micropores in the interlayer are responsible for accommodating the shuttling polysulfides and offering sufficient electrolyte accessibility. Therefore, utilizing the sulfur/long-chain polysulfide redox couple with an efficient interlayer configuration in Li-S batteries may be a promising choice for high-power applications.

Herein, a composite of CoNiP quantum dot-decorated graphene oxide (CoNiP-rGO) was designed and prepared and used as a sulfur host in Li-S batteries. SEM and TEM images show that countless CoNiP quantum dots (CoNiP-QDs) are uniformly dispersed on the rGO nanosheets. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations certify the metallic property and high activity of the CoNiP-QDs. At the same time, the rGO enhances the electronic conductivity of the electrode and ensures uniform dispersion of the CoNiP-QDs. Benefitting from the CoNiP-QDs and rGO, compared with the CoP or NiP sulfur hosts reported in the literature, the CoNiP-rGO host demonstrates obvious advantages in specific capacity and cycle stability. The Li-S battery with the CoNiP-rGO/S cathode demonstrates a high capacity of 598.2 mA h g(-1) at 3C rate. At the same time, it delivers excellent cycle-performance with a capacity decay rate of 0.08% after 600 cycles at 1C rate. This work provides a simple and universally applicable method for manufacturing metal phosphide quantum dot/rGO as a sulfur host for Li-S batteries.

These effects include preventing electrolyte degradation and improving the cycle stability of Li-S cells. However, little is known regarding the underlying reasons of such performance improvements. In this work, we present a theoretical study of the halogen-doping effect on the delithiation (charge) process on a (Li2S)(10) model structure representing a potential final discharge product. It is revealed that the electron polaron is the dominant charge carrier during the charge process, and iodine is a facilitating agent for lithium detachment from the lithium sulfide cluster. However, the graphene support was found as potentially slowing down the ionic transport during the delithiation process due to charge transfer exerted by the support to the doped cluster that may retain the positive ions in the particle.

Further, the composite was modified by PEG-coating, and the cathode composite material of C-CNT/S(PEG) was obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the C-CNT/S(PEG) composite has an amorphous structure, and the sulfur is dispersed into the microspores of carbon material. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests indicate that the CNT is uniformly dispersed in the composite, which forms a three-dimensional conductive structure. Discharge capacity tests reveal the addition of CNT improves the discharge capacity of the composite. The first discharge capacity of PEG-coated composite C-CNT/S(PEG) is up to 1371.1 mAh/g and the discharge capacity remains to be 662.8 mAh/g after 50 cycles. The results demonstrate that the addition of CNT and PEG-coating can greatly improve the electrochemical performance of activated carbon/sulfur cathode materials.

Problematics of the Li/S cell arise from its particular mechanism, based on dissolution/precipitation phenomena of active materials along cycling. The phase transitions endured by active material are responsible for dramatic changes in the morphology of the positive electrode upon cycling, and results in severe capacity fading. In this work, vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNT) were investigated as a positive electrode 3D current collector for Li/S cells, combined with a semi-liquid VACNT/Polysulfides (catholyte)/Li battery configuration. The influence of the catholyte composition and the sulfur concentration, and the impact of electrolyte solvents and additives in the catholyte were investigated, yielding significant improvements in terms of practical surface capacity of the cells.

Based on the rational control of fungi filtration and drying, fungi membrane or aerogel was obtained. Through pyrolysis in an inert atmosphere, intact carbon-fiber monolith (membrane or aerogel) was formed and its conductivity was more than 1 S cm(-1). The carbon-fiber aerogel and membrane synthesized at 800 degrees C was doped by N (similar to 2.4 at%) and O (similar to 1.3 at%) and displayed a BET surface area of similar to 305 and similar to 20 m(2) g(-1), respectively. Mesopores and macropores were detected in the carbon materials. The carbon-fiber monolith showed promising capability to improve the cyclability and capacity of lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries, and are expected to be used as versatile electrode in energy storage.

In this work, 3D interconnected TiO2 nanofibers (TONFs) are prepared and used as sulfur host materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. The interconnected nanofiber structure could provide sufficient channels for the transport of electronics and lithium-ions, demonstrating superior lithium-ion and electronic conductivity. In addition, the presence of metal oxide TiO2 could provide strong chemical adsorption ability for the soluble polysulfide. As a result, the polysulfide migration is greatly inhibited. Therefore, the as-prepared TONFs/S composites display initial high specific capacity and stable cycle performance.

Finding new multiporous insulating materials or wide bandgap semiconductors suitable for the transportation of Li-ions is a key problem for the application of solid state lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this study, an sp(2)-hybridized multiporous boron nitride (d-BN) is found to be able to be used as a solid electrolyte or filter in Li-S batteries due to the lower energy barriers of Li-ion diffusion along its [110] direction. By means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is also found that the d-BN is more stable than most reported BN polymorphs. In addition, the elastic properties, ideal tensile strength, electronic structure, lattice thermal conductivity and phonon lifetime of d-BN are also investigated.

This issue can be solved by the development of molybdenum carbide decorated N-doped carbon hierarchical double-shelled hollow spheres (Mo2C/C HDS-HSs). The mesoporous thick inner shell and the central void of the HDS-HSs achieve high sulfur loading, facilitate the ion/electrolyte penetration, and accelerate charge transfer. The microporous thin outer shell suppresses LiPSs shuttling and reduces the charge/mass diffusion distance. The double-shelled hollow structure accommodates the volume expansion during lithiation. Furthermore, Mo2C/C composition renders the HDS-HSs cathode with improved conductivity, enhanced affinity to LiPSs, and accelerated kinetics of LiPSs conversion. The structural and compositional advantages render the Mo2C/C/S HDS-HSs electrode with high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and ultra-long cycling stability in the composed Li-S batteries.

The resulting sulfur carbon composite material with high residual porosity can be used as the cathode material in lithium sulfur battery cells.

In the MC-Cu-S composite, the MC host that physically confines S/poly-sulfides provides free space to accommodate volumetric expansion of S during lithiation, while the Cu nanoparticles that are anchored in the MC further chemically interact with S/polysulfi des through bonding between Cu and S/polysulfi des. The Cu loading allows the S content to increase from 30 to 50% in the carbon-S cathode material without scarifying the electrochemical performance in a low-cost carbonate electrolyte. At a current density of 100 mA g(-1), the MC-Cu-S cathode shows that Coulumbic efficiency is close to 100% and capacity maintains more than 600 mAh g(-1) with progressive cycling up to more than 500 cycles. In addition, the Cu nano-inclusins also enhance the electronic conductivity of the MC-Cu-S composite, remarkably increasing the rate capabilities. Even the current density increases 10.0 A g(-1), the MC-Cu-S cathode can still deliver a capacity of 200 mAh g(-1). This strategy of stabilization of S with small amount of metal nanoparticles anchored in MC provides an effective approach to improve the cycling stability, Coulumbic efficiency, and S loading for Li-S batteries.

Herein, CoS2 nanoparticles catalyst embedded in porous carbon polyhedron (NC-CoS2) are prepared through in situ method. The CoS2 nanoparticles keep tight connection with carbon, which enable them effectively get electrons through carbon and catalyze the conversion of polysulfide. The porous carbon polyhedron shows high absorption ability to polysulfide and can immobilize polysulfide around CoS2 nanoparticles, which improve the utilization of catalysis sites. With the synergistic effect of porous structure and CoS2 nanoparticles, the Li-S batteries with NC-CoS2 cathode can deliver as high as 1600 and 1150 mAh g(-1) at current density of 0.1 and 0.5C, respectively. After cycling 150 times at 0.1C, a capacity of 1050 mAh g(-1) is retained. Additionally, the NC-CoS2 cathode shows high initial discharge capacity of 920 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, and about 835 mAh g(-1) has been reserved after 100 cycles. The results indicate that the CoS2 nanoparticles play a crucial role in improving the performance of batteries owing to their propelling redox reaction of polysulfide. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

One-pot approach to synthesize PPy@S core-shell nanocomposite cathode for Li/S batteries	JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH			English	Article						Core-shell structure; Lithium/sulfur battery; Nanostructured sulfur cathode; Sulfur/polypyrrole composite; Energy storage	SULFUR CATHODE; SULFUR/CARBON COMPOSITE; PERFORMANCE; CARBON	A polypyrrole-coated sulfur composite (PPy@S) was synthesized by in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomers on the surface of nano-sulfur particles. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping showed the formation of a highly developed core-shell structure with uniform PPy coating on the surface of sulfur particles. The electrochemical properties of the resulting PPy@S composite cathode have been evaluated by cyclic voltammograms and galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling. The results show that the PPy@S composite exhibits a reversible capacity of 1,200 mAh g(-1) at the initial cycle, with 913 mAh g(-1) remaining after 50 cycles. Even up to 2.5 C, a reversible capacity of 437 mAh g(-1) is obtained. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the conductive PPy-coating nanolayer, which provides both an effective electron conduction path and a strong physical and chemical confinement setting for elemental sulfur and resident polysulfides, minimizing the loss of active material during cycling.

Hollow mesoporous carbon nitride nanosphere/three-dimensional (3D) graphene composite (HMCN-G) is subsequently fabricated via a hydrothermal treatment of HMCN with graphene oxide. As an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the HMCN-G shows significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and HMCN in terms of the electron-transfer number, current density and onset potential. Increased density of catalytically active sites and improved accessibility to electrolyte enabled by the hollow and mesoporous architecture of HMCN, and high conductivity induced from graphene are considered to contribute to the remarkable electrocatalytic performance of the HMCN-G. Furthermore, HMCN-G exhibits superior methanol tolerance to Pt/C catalyst, suggesting that it is a promising metal-free electrocatalyst for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).

Replacing liquid electrolyte with poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) -based solid-state electrolyte is considered as a promising method to boost the safety, but the shuttle effect of LiPSs cannot be completely eliminated. In this work, a new kind of double-layer PEO-based polymer electrolyte is designed to restrict the LiPSs. The layer next to cathode consists of PEO and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). The other layer consists of PEO. PVP with abundant of amide groups has been proved to have strong affinity to LiPSs. The strong interaction between LiPSs and carbonyl groups in amide is verified by Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests. As a result, the assembled Li-S battery exhibits a specific capacity of 1100 mAh g(-1) and capacity retention of 347 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 60 degrees C and 0.05 C, while the capacity retention of the battery without PVP-blended PEO electrolyte remains only 27 % at the same conditions.

It is found that the addition of LiFSI promotes ionic conduction, reduces polysulfide solubility in the electrolyte, and enhances the compatibility of the electrolyte with metallic Li. Consequently, increased reversible capacity, improved cycle stability and rate capability are exhibited in an additive-contained fluorinated electrolyte with moderate amount of DOL. It further reveals that the synergistic function of the fluorinated ether and LiFSI greatly modify and stabilize Li surface. However, rich DOL employed in the fluorinated electrolyte results in excessive polysulfide dissolution and inferior interface quality despite the raised ionic conductivity, which is unfavorable for the overall cell performance instead even though the additive was employed.

Herein, a conductive composite architecture that is made up of bio-derived N-doped porous carbon fiber bundles (N-PCFs) with co-imbedded cobalt and niobium carbide nanoparticles is employed as a multifunctional integrated host for simultaneously addressing the challenges in both Li anodes and S cathodes. The implantation of Co and NbC nanoparticles bestows the N-PCFs matrix with synergistically enhanced degree of graphitization, electrical conductivity, hierarchical porosity, and surface polarization. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that NbC with specific lithiophilic and sulfiphilic features can synchronously regulate the Li and S electrochemistry by realizing homogeneous lithium deposition with suppressed Li-dendrite growth and exerting catalytic effects for promoting the polysulfide conversion together with fast Li2S nucleation. Hence, the assembled Li-S full batteries exhibit a superb rate capability (704 mAh g(-1)at 5 C) and cycling life (approximate to 82.3% capacity retention after 500 cycles) at a sulfur loading over 3.0 mg cm(-2), as well as high reversible areal capacity (>6.0 mAh cm(-2)) even at a higher sulfur loading of 6.7 mg cm(-2).

However, its low electron conductivity and lithium transfer cause significant polarization in Li2S electrodes. Here, we demonstrate the use of ultrasmall Li2S nanocrystals encapsulated in N-rich carbon (NRC) as a cathode material for Li-S batteries. By evaporating a mixture of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and Li2S in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution and then subjecting the mixture to carbonization, a nano-Li2S@NRC composite with ultrasmall Li2S well dispersed in its carbon matrix was successfully synthesized. The obviously lower potential barriers and excellent cycling performance of nano-Li2S@NRC electrodes confirm their improved polarization because of the size effect of Li2S nanocrystals and the good electron transfer between Li2S and N-doped carbon. The nano-Li2S@NRC cathode delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1046 mA h g(-1) of Li2S (similar to 1503 mA h g(-1) of S) at 0.25C and 958 mA h g(-1) of Li2S (similar to 1376 mA h g(-1) of S) at 0.5C with a favorable cycling performance with an similar to 0.041% decay rate per cycle over 1000 cycles.

The meticulous structural design of using CNT to thread the ZIF-8-derived porous carbon polyhedrons together endows the porous carbon thin film with nice flexibility, high surface area (645.2 m(2) g(-1)), and hierarchical pore structure as well as good nitrogen doping (2.8 at%) and overall electrical conductivity. When used as binder-free electrode for a supercapacitor, the CNCF delivers a high specific capacitance of 340 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1), long-term stability with a coulombic efficiency of 97.7% after 10 000 cycles at 20 A g(-1), and high energy density of 21.1 W h kg(-1) with a power density of 5000 W kg(-1). It can also serve as an efficient sulfur host for the Li-S battery. The S@CNCF electrode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 926 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1C, and 614 mA h g(-1) after 1800 cycles with an ultra-low overall capacity decay of 0.02%/cycle with sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2). Moreover, when the sulfur loading is increased to 6.9 mg cm(-2), the electrode shows a high initial areal capacity of 7.3 mA h cm(-2) and a volumetric capacity of 0.94 A h cm(-3).

The ASSLB5 with inorganic electrolytes usually have a thick electrolyte layer (more than 1 mm), which significantly reduces the cell-based energy density; therefore, a free-standing high-conductance electrolyte layer with a low thickness is essential for high-performance ASSLB5. In this work, we prepare free-standing 78Li(2)S-22P(2)S(5) glass-ceramic (7822gc) composite solid electrolyte membranes reinforced with polymer electrolytes with a thickness of 120 mu m through a liquid-phase method and systematically investigate the effects of solvents and polymer electrolytes on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of the 7822gc/polymer composite membranes. The sulfide/PEO and sulfide/PVDF composite electrolytes without lithium salt show an ionic conductivity of 2-4 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at room temperature, while the conductivity of those with lithium salt is enhanced to 4-7 x 10(-4) S cm(-1). With such a high conductivity and low thickness, an ultra-high areal conductance of 59.0 mS cm(-2) is obtained for the composite electrolyte membranes, which is similar to 2.7 times of that of pure 7822gc electrolyte pellets. All-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) with a sulfur/carbon nanotube composite cathode and a Li-In alloy anode are prepared. The cell-based energy density is as high as 87.0 Ah L-1. A discharge capacity of 725.1 mA h g(-1) at 0.176 mA cm(-2) after 100 cycles and a high capacity retention of 93.2% are achieved for the cells with 7822gc/polymer composite electrolyte membranes.

J	He, G; Ji, XL; Nazar, L				He, Guang; Ji, Xiulei; Nazar, Linda			High "C" rate Li-S cathodes: sulfur imbibed bimodal porous carbons	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							MESOPOROUS SILICA; SELF-DISCHARGE; BATTERY	A highly ordered mesoporous carbon with a bimodal pore structure which exhibits a high specific area and large pore volume, was synthesized by a triblock-copolymer-templating approach. This optimized framework served as the scaffold for the preparation of carbon/sulfur (C/S) nanocomposites that serve as novel cathodes for Li-S batteries. They exhibit high discharge capacities and good cycling stability at very high current rates of 1675 mA g(-1) (1 C), which can be attributed to the unique bimodal porous structure of the carbon. The small mesopores contain the majority of the sulfur mass and aid in suppressing the diffusion of polysulfide species into the electrolyte, whilst the large interconnected cylindrical pores favour rapid transport of solvated Li+ on charge/discharge. Additional doping with hydrophilic nanoporous silica also aids in capacity retention on cycling.

The structure has a layer of functionalized graphene sheets/stacks (FGS) and a layer of sulfur nanoparticles creating a three-dimensional sandwich-type architecture. This unique FGSS nanoscale layered composite has a high loading (70 wt%) of active material (S), a high tap density of similar to 0.92 g cm(-3), and a reversible capacity of similar to 505 mAh g(-1) (similar to 464 mAh cm(-3)) at a current density of 1680 mA g(-1) (1C). When coated with a thin layer of cation exchange Nafion film, the migration of dissolved polysulfide anions from the FGSS nanocomposite was effectively reduced, leading to a good cycling stability of 75% capacity retention over 100 cycles. This sandwich-structured composite conceptually provides a new strategy for designing electrodes in energy storage applications.

After melting and absorbing sulfur in a autoclave at 150 degrees C , a kind of S@C composite electrode material with high capacity was prepared. The composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD) , Raman spectroscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The results show that the carbon material has a 3D structure with anisotropic channels and multi-level pores. The channels are arranged orderly in parallel with the growth direction of the tree trunk. In addition, there are many micropores on the inner wall of the carbon material activated by KOH. So the material has high pore volume and specific surface area. Furthermore, the Li/S battery was assembled by using S@C composite as cathode material. The electrochemical results show that the first discharge capacity of the S@C composite electrode material reaches 1595 mA . h /g, which is close to the theoretical specific capacity of sulfur electrode material( 1670 mA . h/g).

This thermal treatment induced crosslinking, with the in-situ generation of Na2SO4 (activating agent), before carbonization and activation. The thermal treatment also resulted in the formation of sulfur salts, which could be converted to elemental sulfur upon a simple HCl acid wash. The sulfur content in the monoliths measured by microanalysis could be increased from 17.07 wt. % to 39.74 wt. % by incorporating additional Na2SO4 into the monoliths prior to pyrolysis. The sulfur was uniformly dispersed within the micropores of the carbon, and could be selectively removed by degassing (heating under vacuum) at different temperatures, revealing specific surface areas of up to 1051 m(2) g(-1). The materials were characterized by various techniques and were also evaluated for their potential as cathode materials for the lithium-sulfur battery. This work may open up new and facile routes to prepare sulfur-containing porous carbons for applications where its presence is beneficial. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Compared to scattered reports on anode and electrolyte development, a huge effort in cathode research has led to the discovery of various new carbon materials with improved cell performance. Nevertheless, most of these carbons have cost issues with challenges in mass production, making their potential in practical LiS batteries lean. On the other hand, a wide range of industrial conductive carbons are available with varied specifications and could be a good source for LiS batteries if properly engineered. Herein, we systematically assessed 10 industrial conductive carbons and found one particularly suitable to the fabrication of high-performance sulfur cathode. The carbon has a moderately high specific surface area and good electrical conductivity, and a moderate adsorption capacity to polysulfides. With a small portion of the carbon substituted by single-walled carbon nanotubes, an effective conductive network forms in the resultant sulfur electrode, facilitating sulfur reduction and polysulfide oxidation in cell operations. Consequently, it renders a reduced voltage hysteresis, increased cell capacity, and uniform sulfur deposition in charge reaction on a mechanically enhanced electrode. At a sulfur content of 62.5 wt %, the cathode delivers a specific discharge capacity of 452 mA h g(-1) of electrode at 1C, corresponding to a high energy density of 840 W h kg(-1) (1.7 times that of LiCoO2 cathode). A capacity retention of 75% was seen after 300 dischargecharge cycles, proving the feasibility of using industrial carbons to fabricate high-performance sulfur electrode for practical LiS batteries.

Recently, three-dimensional (3D) graphene architecture assembled from flexible 2D graphene via non-covalent interaction has attracted great attention, for the collective interaction between graphene sheets enables various functional advances while having the intrinsic properties of individual sheet well preserved. Typical macrostructures of 3D graphene involve hierarchical porosity, large specific surface area, superior mechanical strength, and excellent electrical conductivity, which endow this emerging material with great potential in catalytic, environmental, biomedical, and to the upmost importance, energy-related applications. Ever-growing concerns caused by fossil fuels about sustainability and environmental issues have urged extensive research on high-performance materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Taking advantage of the controlled synthesis of novel electrochemically active nanomaterials and their efficient integration with 3D graphene framework, our group is innovatively developed several versatile strategies and successfully fabricated a series of 3D graphene composites. Carrying elaborate microstructures and synergistic effect, as-obtained materials demonstrate outstanding electrochemical performance when employed in flexible electrodes and devices such as supercapacitors, lithium/sodium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and electrocatalysts. Our studies have been decently recognized as effective solutions to address the impending energy problems. Meanwhile, the natural 2DP attribute of graphene has aroused great enthusiasm for rational organic synthesis of new 2DPs at the atomic or molecular level. The controllable synthesis of 2DPs with tailored molecular structure and excellent processability can promote immensely the progress of polymer synthetic chemistry. Further, it exhibits vast strength in the development of novel polymeric materials that hold desirable properties and functions rare in conventional one-dimensional polymers. Since it is challenging but meaningful in the energy arene to design and synthesize 2DPs that integrate simultaneously 2D conjugated plane, in-plane uniform micropores, and electrochemical active groups. This feature article summarizes the synthesis of 3D graphene-based composites and 2DPs progressed in our group, followed by their applications in energy storage and conversion. The contribution ends with brief discussions and outlook about the future challenges and opportunities of graphene materials and relevant research field.

Herein, a flexible electrode consisting of Co9S8 nanocrystals and CNTs encapsulated inside porous N-doped carbon nanofibers (NCF) (CNT@NC/Co9S8) was developed by electrospinning followed by in-situ sulfurization. The carbon nanofibers and embedded CNTs build a highly conductive network, while the Co9S8 and N dopant provide more polar sites for LiPSs confinement. This self-supported flexible electrode with a sulfur loading of 12.5 mg cm(-2) exhibits a high initial discharge capacity (1207.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (831.2 mAh g(-1) at 4.0C) and cycling stability (765.5 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 78.1% after 1000 cycles at 2.0C). Moreover, when the sulfur loading increases to 20 and 30 mg cm(-2), high capacities of 869.2 and 706.6 mAh g(-1) can still be obtained at 0.1C after 100 cycles, respectively. Theoretical analysis suggests that the sulfur cathode built on CNT@NC/Co9S8 is electrocatalytically active towards LiPSs redox with enhanced conversion dynamics, thus mitigating the detrimental PSS effect.

J	Lee, JY; Park, GD; Choi, JH; Kang, YC				Lee, Jun Yeob; Park, Gi Dae; Choi, Jae Hun; Kang, Yun Chan			Structural combination of polar hollow microspheres and hierarchical N-doped carbon nanotubes for high-performance Li-S batteries	NANOSCALE			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; MESOPOROUS SIO2; ANODE MATERIALS; HIGH-CAPACITY; CATHODE; STORAGE; NANOPARTICLES; SPHERES; SHELL; CORE	Hierarchical structured materials constructed with conductive carbon materials have been extensively studied as S host materials for Li-S batteries. However, their outwardly developed hierarchical structures, which do not contain structures or materials to inhibit polysulfide dissolution, lead to the dissipation of dissolved polysulfides and poor dispersion properties during the slurry-making process, which results in non-uniformity in the cathodes. Herein, an assembly of polar materials (hollow structured SiO2 microspheres) and electrically conductive hierarchical N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (b-NCNTs) is designed as an efficient S host material for minimizing the dissolution of polysulfides during Li-S battery operations. Highly aligned and packed b-NCNTs are grown in hollow structured SiO2 microspheres. The SiO2 layer coated on the surface of the hollow CoFe2O4 microspheres plays a key role in the synthesis of easily dispersible hierarchical b-NCNTs microspheres (b-NCNTs@SiO2). The S-loaded b-NCNTs@SiO2 electrodes show better cycling stability than S-loaded b-NCNTs electrodes. The polysulfide trapping of the polar SiO2 layer and the well-developed b-NCNTs minimize the dissolution of polysulfides during cycling. In addition, the introduction of electronegative N atoms into the b-NCNTs lattice enhances their polysulfide trapping ability. The S-loaded b-NCNTs@SiO2 electrodes exhibit stable discharge capacities of >771 mA h g(-1) over 195 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C and a high reversible capacity of 486 mA h g(-1) even at a high current density of 5.0 C.

J	de Haro, J; Benitez, A; Caballero, A; Morales, J				de Haro, Jorge; Benitez, Almudena; Caballero, Alvaro; Morales, Julian			Revisiting the HKUST-1/S Composite as an Electrode for Li-S Batteries: Inherent Problems That Hinder Its Performance	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						HKUST-1; Li-S batteries; Metal-organic frameworks; Pore systems; Sulfur	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; CARBON MATERIALS; SITES	A composite formed by the HKUST-1 metal-organic framework (MOF) and sulfur (S) was studied as an electrode for Li-S batteries. For preparation, a simple milling procedure in ethanol, to facilitate its homogeneity, was used instead of melt diffusion. Different instrumental techniques were used to characterize the structural, morphological and textural properties of the compound. The results revealed a MOF with a high degree of purity, a high specific surface area and a dual micropore and mesopore system. Although capacity retention is good, losing 0.88 mAh g(-1) per cycle, capacity values are low, 200 mAh g(-1) at 100 cycles recorded at C/10 rate. Furthermore, the electrode only gives a moderate electrochemical performance at intermediate current rates. In parallel, a review was carried out of the reported results of this MOF for this application. Although better performances of the HKUST-1 MOF have been published for this application, in some cases, the lack of experimental data to confirm them and serious doubts about the actual content of S in the composite bring the results into question. Only by increasing the additive content, working with low S loading, increasing the measurement voltage window and lowering the current rate can the electrode deliver higher capacities. The inherent problems of this MOF and others with similar properties are indeed their insulating character since the textural properties are adequate for S impregnation and absorption of the polysulfides formed.

In this study, we firstly report a novel and facile one-step process using template-directed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to fabricate highly nitrogen doped three-dimensional (3D) N-doped carbon nanotubes/N-doped graphene architecture (N-CNTs/N-graphene). We used nickel foam as substrate, melamine as a single source for both carbon and nitrogen, respectively. The morphology and microstructure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, isothermal analyses, X-ray photoelectron microscopy and Raman spectra.

J	Hyun, JE; Lee, PC; Tatsumi, I				Hyun, Jung Eun; Lee, Pyoung-Chan; Tatsumi, Ishihara			Preparation and electrochemical properties of sulfur-polypyrrole composite cathodes for electric vehicle applications	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Polypyrrole; Composite; Lithium-sulfur; Battery; Electric vehicle	RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES; CARBON NANOTUBES COMPOSITE; CONDUCTING POLYPYRROLE; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE	The dissolution of polysulfides from the cathode remains a key roadblock in the advancement of Li-S batteries. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using sulfur-polypyrrole composite cathodes for suppressing polysulfide dissolution. Tubular polypyrrole was synthesized by a self-degraded template method and the effect of the amount of oxidant (FeCl3) on the electrochemical performance of sulfur-polypyrrole composite cathodes was studied. To achieve the performance suitable for electric vehicle applications, the sulfur loading of the electrode was maintained at 4.5 mg cm(-2). The sulfur-polypyrrole composite cathode showed a better performance compared to bare sulfur, despite the high sulfur loading and thickness. Further, the amount of polypyrrole synthesized increased with an increase in the oxidant ratio. However, the addition of an excess amount of oxidant beyond 12.6 mmol affected the shape of polypyrrole and resulted in spherical clusters, which caused deterioration in the electrochemical performance.

It was found that (1) the additional sulfur on the separator participated at the electrode reaction occurring in the cathode region, contributing to the improvement of the areal capacity of Li-S batteries, and (2) the areal capacity significantly increased with the mass ratio of sulfur on the separator (S-sep) to sulfur in cathode (S+). At the high S-sep/S+ mass ratio of 5.0 the Li-S cell delivered fourfold higher areal capacity of 4.28 mAh/cm(2) than that of the control cell, along with excellent capacity retention of 90% after 50 cycles, demonstrating that the new concept for Li-S cells could be highly advantageous in boosting the Li-S battery cell performance. The new approach can be widely applied to increase the areal capacity and volumetric energy density of Li-S batteries.

The resulting carbons consist mainly of highly graphitic shells due to the highly dispersed iron in the precursor structure which catalyzes the formation of graphitic carbon. In addition, a distinct onion-like morphology is observed, with high total pore volumes of up to 1 cc/g and a hierarchically structured porosity in which the hollow cores of the carbon onions are accessible via smaller micro- and mesopores. As a proof of concept we furthermore demonstrate the inherent structure of this carbon being advantageous for the application in lithium-sulfur batteries as a both confining and contacting host for the active material, yielding capacities of up to 550 mAh/g after 40 cycles.

However, the usage of metallic Li anodes inevitably causes safety risk due to the growth of Li dendrites. In this review, we summarized the recent research progresses on flexible LMBs, with specific emphasis on the design of composite Li metal anodes and solid-state electrolytes with high flexibility and safety. We begin with a brief introduction of flexible LMBs and the associated anodes and electrolytes. Then, the preparation of flexible composite Li metal anodes has been described in detail, with the evolution from the conventional electrodeposition method to thermal infusion and mechanical rolling methods. For solid-state electrolytes, the advanced progress on shapeable ceramic, polymer, and hybrid electrolytes have been introduced. We also presented comprehensive summaries on high-energydensity flexible LMBs, including flexible lithium-sulfur batteries and lithium-oxygen batteries. Finally, we proposed the future trends, challenges, and prospects toward the practical applications of advanced flexible LMBs.

Although some effort has been made to suppress the shuttle process, more highly conductive materials with stronger adsorption ability to polysulfides are still in urgent demand. Another important problem is the deteriorating performance of Li-S batteries with prolonged cycling owing to irreversible deposition of lithium sulfide (Li2S). However, a host material for the effective conversion of insoluble Li2S has been elusive up to now. Herein, porous molybdenum carbide nanorods (Mo2C NRs), with high catalytic activity for Li2S and ultrastrong adsorption for polysulfides, are used as a bifunctional host material and incorporated into sulfur cathodes for the first time. The bifunctional Mo2C NRs have the advantage of immobilizing polysulfides over the conventional host, with adsorption energies from -4.89 to -8.20eV for Li2Sx (x=1, 2, 4, 6, and 8). The electrochemical analysis shows that Mo2C NRs, more than an anchor, can activate Li2S by greatly reducing the charging overpotential. Therefore, the irreversible deposition of polysulfides is effectively restrained and the utilization of Li2S is clearly enhanced. The Mo2C NRs-sulfur composites (Mo(2)CNRs-S) cathodes provide a capacity of 1298mAhg(-1) at 0.1C in the Li-S batteries. More importantly, the battery with Mo(2)CNRs-S cathodes exhibits a much lower capacity decay of 0.062% per cycle at 1C over 500 cycles.

J	Wen, ZS; Lu, D; Li, S; Sun, JC; Ji, SJ				Wen, Zhongsheng; Lu, Dong; Li, Song; Sun, Juncai; Ji, Shijun			Fabrication and Electrochemical Performance of Sulfur/Carbon Composite Synthesized from Self-Assembled Phenol Resin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						sulfur; composite; microporous carbon; phenol resin; Li-S batteries	RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIALS; SULFUR BATTERIES; ELECTRODES	Sulfur is a promising cathode material for secondary Li-S batteries for its high theoretic capacity although it is confronted with serious issues of high dissolution in electrolyte and low conductivity. High dispersion of sulfur is demonstrated a feasible way to improve the conductivity of sulfur and simultaneously alleviate the mass loss for the dissolution of intermediate Li2Sx (x<4) compounds during cycling. In this paper, sulfur/carbon composite composed of sulfur and microporous carbon was prepared by facile heat diffusion method, in which sulfur was impregnated in the micropores of carbon matrix. The electrochemical performance of this composite as cathode material in Li-S batteries was investigated. The specific capacity of sulfur involved in the composite was close to 1467 mAhg(-1) based on the weight fraction of sulfur, ignoring the possible lithium insertion into carbon matrix. The utilization efficiency of sulfur is higher than most reports related to sulfur cathode, achieving 90% of its theoretic capacity. The cyclability of the sulfur/carbon composite is very excellent and the retained capacity after 100 cycles is 91% of its first discharging capacity.

Here, by directly profiling the activation energies in the multistep SRR, we reveal that the initial reduction of sulfur to the soluble polysulfides is relatively easy owing to the low activation energy, whereas the subsequent conversion of the polysulfides into the insoluble Li2S2/Li2S has a much higher activation energy, contributing to the accumulation of polysulfides and exacerbating the polysulfide shuttling effect. We use heteroatom-doped graphene as a model system to explore electrocatalytic SRR. We show that nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped graphene considerably reduces the activation energy to improve SRR kinetics. Density functional calculations confirm that the doping tunes the p-band centre of the active carbons for an optimal adsorption strength of intermediates and electroactivity. This study establishes electrocatalysis as a promising pathway to tackle the fundamental challenges facing lithium-sulfur batteries.

Here, we develop a unique doughnutlike graphene quantum dot (GQD)/Fe2O3@S@SnO2 composite for Li-S batteries. The GQDs are confined inside the yolk-shell structure, which could shorten the pathway for electron and ion transport, enhancing the utilization of sulfur and achieving an energy-storage performance. Both the Fe2O3 core and SnO2 shell display strong binding with Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8, which is verified by using density functional theory calculations. The doughnutlike GQD/Fe2O3@S@SnO2-based Li-S battery displays a capacity of 923 mAh g(-1) after cycling 100 times, an approximate to 100% Coulombic efficiency, and a recoverable rate performance after repeated measurements. The constructed battery possesses a good tolerance at a high temperature of 45 degrees C. These findings would enable the doughnutlike yolk-shell design to be broadly applied for developing other emerging high-performance materials and their secondary batteries.

Degradation is prevented by the micrometer-scale V2O5 layer that physically isolates the anode and cathode electrolytes, thus blocking diffusion of dissolved polysulfide anions while permitting solid-state transport of Li+ cations. This divided cell architecture eliminates the interaction of soluble polysulfide with the Li anode. Mechanical integrity of the thin V2O5 layer is achieved by depositing the layer on a commercial polymeric battery separator. In addition, the isolated cathode electrolyte is optimized by the intentional addition of Li2S8, which suppresses redistribution of sulfur within the nanostructured carbon-sulfur composite cathode. A 5 mA h pouch cell this design has been cycled >300 times over similar to 1 year without noticeable degradation at capacities of 800 mA h g-sulfur(-1).

Dense (non-hollow) carbon nanospheres: synthesis and electrochemical energy applications	MATERIALS TODAY NANO			English	Article						Carbon nanospheres; Porous carbon nanospheres; Supercapacitors; Batteries; Oxygen reduction reaction	ORDERED MESOPOROUS CARBON; ONE-POT SYNTHESIS; AEROSOL-ASSISTED SYNTHESIS; OXYGEN-REDUCTION; SODIUM-ION; NANOPOROUS CARBON; PHENOLIC-RESIN; POLYSTYRENE LATEX; ANODE MATERIALS; TEMPLATE-FREE	Porous carbon materials have extraordinary importance as electrodes in many electrochemical devices used for energy storage and conversion. For this reason, there is a growing interest in the design of new carbon materials with improved chemical and structural properties that enhance their electrochemical performance providing high energy and power densities as well as long cyclability. To satisfy this demand, researchers are continuously looking for new types of carbon materials that fulfill the above requirements. In this respect, carbon nanospheres (CNSs) have attracted great attention because, besides the typical characteristics of carbon materials, they have short diffusional pathways that provide fast kinetics, which is an important feature for advanced electrochemical energy systems. This review summarizes the synthesis strategies used to produce non-hollow carbon nanospheres, including methodologies based on the use of hard (e.g. silica) or soft (e.g. surfactants) templates, as well as template-free procedures that involve the production of polymer nanospheres and their conversion to CNSs and porous carbon nanospheres (PCNSs). In addition, the use of CNSs and PCNSs as electrodes in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors, batteries (e.g. alkali-ion, lithium-sulfur, etc.), or Li-ion capacitors, as well as ORR electrocatalysts for energy conversion, is analyzed in detail.

Nevertheless, performance ceiling exists, restrict severely by the significant LiPSs diffusion barrier, which inevitably decrease the conversion efficiency of LiPSs. Amorphization can not only promote the diffusion of LiPSs on catalyst surface but also induce the modulation of surface electronic states and strengthen the adsorption toward LiPSs, in comparison with crystalline counterpart. Herein, crystalline Mo2C-amorphous MoO3 heterostructure grown on nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets is meticulously designed as an efficient sulfur immobilizer and promoter through a facile oxygen plasma treatment strategy. With the integrated advantage of improved adsorption and facilitated diffusion of LiPSs by amorphous MoO3, superior LiPSs redox kinetics by the catalytic effect of conductive Mo2C, and long-range electron transfer network arising from nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets, the assembled battery based on the as-developed modified separator endows excellent electrochemical performance and satisfactory cycling stability. This work provides an easy route to synergistic regulate crystallinity and heterogeneous interfaces of multifunctional catalysts for high energy density Li -S batteries.

Here we show, by studying the individual effects of a number of cycling-and electrolyte-related parameters on a simple Li-S cell, that the rate-capability results are sensitive not only to the applied current but also to the cycling prehistory of the cell. On the one hand, the performance is affected by the order in which cycling rate is changed. Slow initial rates aggravate material loss and reduce the achievable capacity. On the other hand, the results of rate-capability tests are significantly different when the rates are varied only on the charge or only on the discharge. The charge rate does not directly affect the measured capacity, whereas the discharge rate does, especially when discharge cutoff voltages are high, due to slow discharge reactions. High charge rates, however, do affect the long-term stability, which is difficult to predict from usual rate-capability tests. Our findings also provide insights into the relative reaction rates and the influence of the general cycling procedures, underlining the importance of understanding the kinetics of Li-S systems, while designing them for high performance batteries.

High-performance nitrogen-doped titania nanowire decorated carbon cloth electrode for lithium-polysulfide batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Li-S battery; carbon cloth; nanowire; adsorption; precipitation	LI-S BATTERIES; SULFUR BATTERIES; POROUS CARBON; LI/POLYSULFIDE BATTERIES; FIBER CLOTH; CATHODE; TIO2; SURFACE; COMPOSITE; NITRIDE	A semi-liquid polysulfide cathode renders a higher sulfur loading for Li-S batteries. However, the aggravated polysulfide shuttle effect and the poor interaction between polysulfide and carbonaceous electrode lower the battery's cycling stability and performance. Here we report a freestanding N-TiO2 nanowire (NW) decorated carbon cloth electrode for a Li-polysulfide battery, where the nitrogen doping in the formed nanowires allows for a higher electrical conductivity and stronger polysulfide binding ability. Meanwhile, with the facile adsorption of S-4(2-) and more active sites provided by the nanowire structure, Li2S precipitation can be improved as well. With the rationally engineered nanostructured polysulfide binding electrode, the battery achieves a remarkably enhanced cycling stability and prolonged discharge capacity (1210 mAh g(-1), 0.2C and 600 mAh g(-1), 1C), in comparison with the pristine carbon cloth (890 mAh g(-1), 0.2C and 210 mAh g(-1), 1C). The facile strategy of fabricating conductive and polysulfide binding nanostructure in this work is thus expected to facilitate the design of high-energy sulfur cathode. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we develop a green, activation-free, top-down method to prepare high-surface-area carbon materials from agricultural wastes through mechanochemistry. The facile mechanochemical process can smash the monolithic agricultural wastes into tiny microparticles with abundant surfaces and bulk defects, which leads to the generation of well developed hierarchical porous structures after direct carbonization. The as-obtained carbon materials simultaneously present high surface areas (1771 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volumes (1.88 cm(3) g(-1)), and thus demonstrate excellent electrochemical performances as the interlayer for lithium sulfur batteries and much superior creatinine adsorption capabilities to the medicinal charcoal tablets. These results provide a new direction for fabricating high-surface-area porous materials without any toxic reagents or complicated activation procedures, and can spur promising electrochemical and medical applications.

It often brings about sluggish redox kinetics, rapid capacity decay and limited sulfur utilization. In this study, we fabricate a novel functional interlayer by wrapping dispersed zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanospheres with a graphene-like ultrathin wrinkled carbon film (ZnS@WCF) through a facile hard-template method. The WCF acts as a unique 3D conductive network and ZnS nanospheres provide strong chemisorption of LiPSs. Owing to the synergistic effects between polar ZnS and the conductive WCF, the as-prepared interlayer can not only serve as a physical barrier but can also recycle the dissolved LiPSs with fast reaction kinetics. Li-S batteries based on such a ZnS@WCF modified separator exhibit remarkable capacity retention and outstanding rate performance. When cycling at 1C, a considerable specific capacity of 685 mA h g(-1) can still be maintained after 600 cycles with an extremely low fading decay of 0.045% per cycle. This novel interlayer holds great potential in realizing the wide practical application of Li-S batteries.

In this article, we present a double protection strategy by fabricating a two-dimensional (2D) core-shell nanostructure to improve the electrochemical performance of metal oxides in lithium storage. The 2D core-shell architecture is constructed by confining the well-defined graphene based metal oxides nanosheets (G@MO) within carbon layers. The resulting 2D carbon-coated graphene/metal oxides nanosheets (G@MO@C) inherit the advantages of graphene, which possesses high electrical conductivity, large aspect ratio, and thin feature. Furthermore, the carbon shells can tackle the deformation of MO nanoparticles while keeping the overall electrode highly conductive and active in lithium storage. As the result, the produced G@MO@C hybrids exhibit outstanding reversible capacity and excellent rate performance for lithium storage (G@SnO2@C, 800 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 200 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles; G@Fe3O4@C, 920 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 200 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles).

We report a scalable CeO2CNT@C porous membrane with a large porosity of 90%. Introducing CNTs is critical to increase the porosity and construct porous networks with CNTs as the skeleton and CeO2-doped carbon as the shell. The macropores can improve the transport of Li+ and electrolyte, while the porous networks possess high polysulfide-adsorbing and electron-transferring ability. The CeOCNT@C membrane can serve as an Al foil-free cathode and an interlayer for LiS batteries. Moreover, CeO2 can immobilize LiPSs and can alleviate its shuttle effect. The LiS batteries with a sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm(2) deliver a capacity of 847 mA h g(1) after 100 cycles, showing a high areal capacity of 5.25 mA h cm(2) at a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.2 mu L mg(1).

Complementing the high theoretical specific capacity of sulfur cathode (similar to 1672 mAh/g), environmentally benign, and low-cost, Li-S batteries can meet the myriad needs of inexpensive and high energy density energy storage. However, the intrinsic drawbacks of poor cycle life and low charge efficiency in conventional Li-S batteries hinder the advancement of this alluring technology. Here, we propose a novel and facile synthesis of binder-free three-dimensional carbon nanotubes (3D CNTs)/sulfur (S) hybrid composite as an electrode material, where 3D CNTs provide a high conduction path and short diffusion length for Li-ions, while confining soluble poly-sulfides within the structure for high cycling performance. The unique binder free cathode design results in one of the highest sulfur loading of 8.33 mg/cm(2) (similar to 55 wt% S in the cathode electrode) with excellent areal and specific capacity of 8.89 mAh/cm(2) and 1068 mAh/g at 0.1C rate (similar to 1.4 mA/cm(2)) offering coulombic efficiency of greater than 95% for 150 cycles. The novel cell exhibits maximum specific energy of similar to 1233 Wh/kg with a specific power of similar to 476 W/kg, with respect to the mass of the cathode. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, J; Xu, YL; He, C; Zhao, JP; Liang, Y				Li, Juan; Xu, Youlong; He, Cheng; Zhao, Jiping; Liang, Yu			Three-dimensional embroidered ball-like alpha-Fe2O3 synthesised by a microwave hydrothermal method as a sulfur immobilizer for high-performance Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							POLYSULFIDE CONVERSION; LITHIUM; CATHODE	The practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is restrained by the sluggish conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the consequent shuttle effect. Using polar metal oxides as affinity substances for LiPS adsorption is an effective method, but how to explore the adsorption ability on various faces of metal oxides has not been well investigated. In this work, 3D embroidered ball-like alpha-Fe2O3 was successfully prepared by a microwave hydrothermal method combined with calcination treatment as a sulfur host material to mitigate LiPS dissolution. Rich functional groups, graphene oxides (GOs), guide the (110) crystal plane growth. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to study the different adsorption energies of LiPSs on the (110) and (104) crystal planes of alpha-Fe2O3, demonstrating that the (110) crystal plane facilitates the conversion of LiPSs and, thus suppresses the shuttle effect. The density of states (DOS) results indicated that the strong negative adsorption energy is mainly derived from the interaction between Fe-d, Fe-s and O-p orbitals. Furthermore, the Fe-S, C-S and S-O bonds as observed from the XPS results further verify the strong internal reaction between the alpha-Fe2O3 substance and LiPSs. Attributed to these benefits, the prepared alpha-Fe2O3/GO-S-25 electrode showed a high initial discharge capacity of 1417 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C. Even at a high current density of 2C, the cells delivered a high discharge capacity of 981 mA h g(-1). A high area specific capacity of 2.84 mA h cm(-2) was obtained with a sulfur loading mass of 3.36 mg cm(-2) after 100 cycles, indicating a good cyclic stability. This work provides a new idea for exploring the adsorption capacity of metal oxides with different crystal faces toward polysulfides and opens up the possibility for the commercialization of Li-S batteries.

However, the serious polysulfides shuttle and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics hinder the development and commercial application of highperformance lithium-sulfur batteries. In this paper, the titanium carbide (TiC)-decorated carbon matrix is considered as the mediator, anchor and electrocatalyst for polysulfides redox reaction. It has been proved that the conductive and polar titanium carbide can not only chemisorbs lithium polysulfides via titanium-sulfur (Ti-S) coordination, but also optimize the lithium sulfide (Li2S) nucleation/precipitation mechanism for better redox reaction. Especially, the graphene oxide and carbon nanotube matrix (GO-CNT) in this case can act as both host for Li2S loading and TiC precipitation. Accordingly, the as-fabricated lithium sulfide-graphene oxide-carbon nanotube-titanium carbide (LS-GO-CNT-TiC) cathode delivers the high initial discharge capacity of 956 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and good rate capability of 508 mAh g-1 at 2C. These results consequently manifest that the conductive and polar matrix of LS-GO-CNT-TiC can perform as a promising cathode of the high performance LSBs.

Herein, we report new synthesis methods and applications of two types of porous carbon nanofibers, i.e., colloidal mesoporous carbon nanofibers as electrode materials for supercapacitors, and microporous carbon nanofibers as substrate media for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. These carbon nanofibers can be synthesized either by confined nanospace pyrolysis or conventional pyrolysis of their polymeric precursors. The supercapacitor electrodes which are fabricated via a simple dipping and rinsing approach exhibit a reversible specific capacitance of 206 F g(-1) at the current density of 5 A g(-1) in 6.0 mol L-1 aqueous KOH electrolyte. Meanwhile, the Li-S batteries composed of microporous carbon nanofiber-encapsulated sulfur structures exhibit unprecedented electrochemical performance with high specific capacity and good cycling stability, i.e., 950 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles of charge-discharge. The excellent electrochemical performance of CNFs is attributed to their high-quality fiber morphology, controlled porous structure, large surface area, and good electrical conductivity. The results show that the carbon nanofibers represent an alternative promising candidate for an efficient electrode material for energy storage and conversion.

Uniform metal-ion flux through interface-modified membrane for highly stable metal batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Lithium metal anode; Lithium dendrite; Nanoporous nanosheet; Na metal anode; Lithium-sulfur battery	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE SUPERCAPACITOR ELECTRODES; REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; ANODE; LAYER; SEPARATOR; ENCAPSULATION; GROWTH; HOST	Lithium (Li) metal has received huge attention as a promising anode candidate due to its high theoretical capacity, the lowest negative potential, and its potential as next-generation energy storage devices (such as Li-S and Li-O-2 batteries), where Li metal electrode is indispensable for the system. However, systemic issues, which are mainly associated with Li dendritic growth, result in poor electrochemical performances and safety problems (e.g. short-circuit). This article describes a unique design of multifunctional membrane, comprising of nanoporous inorganic (SiO2) nanosheet layer, in order to uniformly distribute metal-ion flux and delay the penetration of Li dendrites through the separator. When a designed membrane was employed, the propagation of Li dendrites against the separator was dramatically restrained and suppressed by structural and materialistic benefits of nanoporous inorganic (SiO2) nanosheets, thus leading to the significant enhancement of electrochemical performances of Li metal batteries. Similar to Li metal batteries, it showed analogous promising results and possibilities in achieving high electrochemical stabilities and cycle performances of Na metal batteries. Moreover, Li-S prototype cell coupled with a designed membrane delivered stable cycle retention (over 400 cycles) with high Coulombic efficiency by selectively allowing Li ions to pass through membrane but suppressing the migration of polysulfides.

The material expansion during lithiation was accommodated by the expansion into the remaining empty pore volume and no fracture of the CNT walls was detected. A sharp interface between the initial and lithiated S was observed. The reaction front was flat, oriented perpendicular to the confined S cylinder, and propagated along the cylinder length. Lithiation of S in the proximity of conductive carbon proceeded at the same rate as the one in the center of the pore, suggesting the presence of electron pathways at the Li2S/S interface. Density of states calculations further confirmed this hypothesis. In situ electron diffraction showed a direct phase transformation of S into nanocrystalline Li2S without detectable formation of any intermediates, such as polysulfides and LiS. These important insights may elucidate some of the reaction mechanisms and guide the improvements in the design of C-S nanocomposites for high specific energy Li-S batteries. The proposed use of conductive CNTs with tunable pore diameter as cylindrical reaction vessels for in situ TEM studies of electrochemical reactions proved to be highly advantageous and may help to resolve the ongoing problems in battery technology.

Synthesis and Electrochemical Performance of Sulfur/Highly Porous Carbon Composites	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; CATHODE MATERIALS; ELECTRODE; CELLS; DISCHARGE	Sulfur/highly porous carbon (HPC) composites were synthesized by thermally treating a mixture of sublimed sulfur and HPC. The microstructure of the HPC and the composite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) Surface area. The specific surface area of HPC reaches up to 1472.9 m(2)/g, which is sharply reduced to 24.4 m(2)/g in the sulfur/HPC composite with 57 wt % sulfur. The electrochemical performance of the composites as cathode materials in organic electrolytes was studied by the galvanostatic method and cyclic voltammetry. The sulfur/HPC composite with 57 wt % sulfur delivers the initial high specific capacity up to 1155 mAh/g and a stable capacity of 745 mAh/g after 84 cycles at the current density of 40 mA/g. In addition, it is demonstrated that the excellent cycling stability of the sulfur/HPC composite can be obtained at different current densities. On the basis of the analysis of the microstructure and electrochemical performance, it is confirmed that HPC can effectively prevent the shuttle behavior of the lithium/sulfur battery.

Due to the peculiarity of complete lithiation and the capability to match non-lithium anodes, Li2S-based Li-S batteries have attracted more and more attention. Nevertheless, the same notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides as in traditional Li-S batteries and the poor conductivity of Li2S lead to sluggish conversion reaction kinetics, poor Coulombic efficiency, and cycling performance. Herein, we propose the interconnected porous carbon skeleton as the host, which is modified by an atomically dispersed Mn catalyst as well as O, N atoms (named as ON-MnPC) via the melt salt method, and introduce the Li2S nanosheet into the carbon host with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone ethanol solution. It has been found that the introduction of O, N to bind with Mn atoms can endow the nonpolar carbon surface with ample unsaturated coordination active sites, restrain the shuttle effect, and enhance the diffusion of Li+ and accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics. Besides, due to the ultra-high catalyst activity of atomically dispersed Mn catalysts, the Li2S/ON-MnPC cathode shows good electrochemical performance, e.g., an initial capacity of 534 mAh g(-1), a capacity of 514.18 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, a high retention rate of 96.23%, and a decay rate of 0.04% per cycle. Hence, use of atomically dispersed Mn catalysts to catalyze the chemical conversion reactions of polysulfides from multiple dimensions is a significant exploration, and it can provide a brand-new train of thought for the development and commercialization of the economical, high-performance Li2S-based Li-S batteries.

Herein, we demonstrate the preparation of cobalt (Co) nanoparticles-decorated and nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages confined in a carbon shell (denoted Co-NC@C) through carbonization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-encapsulated ZIF-67 (ZIF-67@PAN) prepared by a simple "phase-inversion" method. The Co nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped carbon frame and confined in the carbon shell can efficiently promote the redox kinetics of PSs due to the confined catalysis, as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculation and electrochemical measurements. Therefore, the sulfur cathode based on such confined hollow core/shell nanocages delivers a capacity of 635.8 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and an outstanding cycling stability with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.018% per cycle for 2700 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, a reversible capacity of 552.9 mAh g(-1) was delivered at a current density of 0.2 C over 500 cycles at a high sulfur loading of 5.7 mg cm(-2) under lean electrolyte condition. Meanwhile, a high areal capacity of 9.5 mAh cm(-2) was achieved at a sulfur loading of 10.2 mg cm(-2). More intriguingly, a soft-packaged Li-S batteries based on this composite cathode material also exhibited superior cycling stability in folding conditions, demonstrating a high potential for practical application in wearable electronic devices.

The optimized Ni-BPC has dual-atom Ni(II)(2)N-4(mu(2)-N)(2) moieties, which are chemically anchored on the alfalfa-derived developed porous N-doped carbon BPC matrix. An ultrahigh specific surface area of 3133 m(2) g(-1) with huge total pore volume of 3.02 cm(3) g(-1) is obtained for Ni-BPC. The Ni-BPC could greatly promote the redox kinetics and effectively prevent the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides in a Li-S battery. The Li-S battery assembled with the Ni-BPC modified separator exhibits prominent rate performance with the reversible specific capacities of 1279, 1119, 1037, 948 and 787 mAh g(-1) at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively. The battery presents an ultra-long life with low capacity decay of 0.028% per cycle up to 2100 cycles at 1 C. Even under high areal S loadings of 3.9 mg cm(-2), the high discharge capacity of 976.6 mAh g(-1) is obtained at 0.2 C and excellent cycling stability with 61.1% capacity retention is achieved after 490 cycles.

Such effects can lead to undesired shorter lifespans and serious safety implications. Herein, we prepared monodispersed 0 D silicon and sulfur nanoparticles which are tightly anchored onto a 2D graphene nanosheet surface (M-Si-NP/GNs and M-S-NP/GNs). Importantly, we demonstrate that the electrochemical property is critically dependent on a combination of nanosize effects and dispersity. From these results a novel lithiated silicon-sulfur cell using lithiated M-Si-NP/GNs and M-S-NP/GNs as anode and cathode, respectively, was developed and tested. Remarkably, the lithiated silicon-sulfur cell displayed large specific capacity of 782 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1). Based on the overall mass of active material on the anode and cathode, the ultra-high energy density of the full cell was 1447 Wh kg(-1). Furthermore, a superior rate performance was observed and an outstanding cycle stability over 500 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1) (i.e. an ultraslow capacity loss per cycle was 0.018%) was maintained.

Li/dissolved polysulfide cells with binder-free, interwoven, self-standing carbon electrodes show outstanding performance in terms of capacity utilization and reversibility. To further understand this system, we present here a binder-free carbon nanofiber (CNF) paper electrode with large interspaces between fibers, low manufacturing cost, and high polysulfide loadings. The 3D interwoven structure of the CNF paper electrode allows transitions between high-order polysulfides (charged products) and lithium sulfide (discharged product) to occur within a confined environment. Crystalline Li2S is found within the large interspaces of the 3D electrode framework after the 1st discharge, avoiding the formation of dense passivation layers on the cathode. The robust porous CNF paper electrode leads to superior electrochemical performance with a reversible capacity of 1094 mA h g(-1) after 80 cycles at a C/5 rate and Coulombic efficiencies above 98% with a sulfur loading of 1.7 mg cm(-2). A stable reversible capacity of similar to 900 mA h g(-1) is obtained with a much higher sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2), making this battery configuration promising for practical applications.

However, it is still challenging to directly use Li metal as anode material in commercial batteries because of unstable Li dendrite formation and accumulated solid-electrolyte interphase. Possible methods that can suppress the unwanted formation of Li dendrites are (i) by increasing the electrode surface area and (ii) formation of porosity for confining Li. Here, we tested microporous (<2 nm) carbon and mesoporous (2-50 nm) carbon as host materials for the Li metal anode to avoid their degradation during cycling of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Mesoporous carbon was more effective than microporous carbon as a host material to confine the Li metal and the lifetime of mesoporous carbon was more than twice as long as those of the Cu foil and microporous carbon. After confirmed better anode performance of mesoporous carbon host material, we applied Li-plated mesoporous carbon as an anode in a lithium-sulfur battery (Li-S) full cell. This research work suggests that mesopores, in spite of their low specific surface area, are better than micropores in stabilizing the Li metal and that a mesoporous host material can be applied to Li metal anodes for use in next-generation battery applications.

The composites consisting of sulphur and spirulina-derived carbon with micro- and meso-pores showed an obvious carbon encapsulating sulphur structure. The carbon/S cathodes exhibited much better electrochemical performance than pristine sulphur, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 662 mAh g-(1) with nearly 60% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C current density (1670 mA g(-1)). The improved electrochemical stability of the composites can be ascribed to the synergistic effects between the encapsulation of sulphur by spirulina-derived carbon and adsorption of polysulfides on N doped carbon lattice. These effects successfully prevented or retarded the shuttle effect of sulphur cathodes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

XPS spectra illustrates that BNG with a high percentage and dispersive B, N (B = 13.47%, N = 9.17%) and abundant pyridinic-N and N-B/N-B bond, show strong interaction with Li2Sx proved by adsorption simulation experiments. As cathode for Li-S half cell, S@BNG with a sulfur content of 75% displays a reversible capacity of 765 mA h g(-1) at 1 C even after 500 cycles (a low fading rate of 0.027% per cycle). Even at a high sulfur loading of 4.73 mg cm(-2), S@BNG still shows a high and stable areal capacity of 3.5 mA h cm-2 after 48 cycles. When S@BNG composite as cathode combines with high performance lithiated Ge anode (discharge capacity of 1138 mA h g(-1) over 1000 cycles at 1 C in half cell), the assembled Ge-S full battery exhibits a superior capacity of 530 mA h g(-1) over 500 cycles at the rate of 1 C.

JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Footprint family; Environmental impacts; LieS battery; Sodium-ion battery; Li-air battery	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; WATER FOOTPRINT; ENERGY; IMPACT; CARBON; CONSUMPTION; PARAMETERS; EMISSIONS; HYBRID; GREEN	The footprint family was used to assess the environmental impact of LieS, sodium-ion and Li-air batteries, and predict the greenest battery model among these three batteries in this study. Besides, considering the assessment sensibility affected of different LCA methodologies, totally 13 methods were used to form a comprehensive assessment result. The ecological footprint of the LieS, sodium-ion and Li-air batteries are 189.40 Pt, 182.58 Pt and 29.84 Pt, respectively; the carbon footprint of the LieS, sodiumion and Li-air batteries are 67.94 kg CO(2)eq, 64.35 kg CO(2)eq and 10.15 kg CO(2)eq, respectively; and the water footprint of the LieS, sodium-ion and Li-air batteries are 151.11 m(3), 316.42 m(3) and 21.15 m(3), respectively. All methods show that Li-air battery is a more environmentally friendly battery model among these three new batteries. The footprint value of LieS battery and Li-air battery mainly comes from the production of lithium-based materials. Also providing 1 kWh of electricity, far low demand for lithium resource is the main reason for Li-air battery to show its environmental advantages compared with LieS battery. Besides, the close ecological and carbon footprints of sodium-ion battery are close to that of LieS battery. And there is a far large water footprint of sodium-ion battery compared with LieS battery. The low cost advantage of sodium resources is not enough to be reflected in the sodium-ion battery's environmental advantages. The demand for lithium and sodium resources per kWh largely determines their environmental impact. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

When used as a cathode material for Li-S batteries, the S@PCNFs-CNT exhibits much better cycle performance and rate performance compared to CNT-free S@PCNFs. It delivers a reversible capacity of 637 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 50 mA g(-1) and a rate capability of 437 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to synergistic effect of the 3D interconnected structure, the additive of CNT, and the uniform distribution of micropores (<2 nm) in the PCNFs-CNT matrix.

CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; MECHANISM; KINETICS; CATHODE; PRECIPITATION; ELECTRODES; INSIGHT	The impact of the solid film deposit (mainly Li2S) on the complex electrochemistry of a Li-S cell is studied in detail. Already a simple, straightforward experiment strongly indicates that this impact might be much smaller than usually assumed. Notably, a similar phenomenon is demonstrated for another battery operated on the same basic principle: the magnesium-sulfur battery. In order to better detect the surface-specific phenomena associated with formation and properties of the solid surface deposit, we construct special electrochemical cells with a flat glassy carbon disc or other well-defined materials. Different model systems are prepared in which crucial variables such as the electrode configuration, separator type, and state of charge are varied in a systematic and controlled way. Electrochemical results are supplemented with data from microstructural analysis, in particular focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) imaging and X-ray diffraction analysis. We show that the growth of the surface film is more complex than generally assumed and that its defect-rich morphology hardly represents any obstacle for electrochemical reaction(s) to take place. Rather, the cell operation is limited by diffusional processes and depletion of polysulfide concentration in electrolyte. The new insight into the occurrence, properties, and especially the impact of solid film deposits on operation of the Li-S system is expected to have important implications for future design of Li-S practical cells.

Improving the self-discharge behavior of sulfur-polypyrrole cathode material by LiNO3 electrolyte additive	IONICS			English	Article						Self-discharge; Lithium-sulfur battery; LiNO3; Sulfur-polypyrrole cathode material; Corrosion	RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM/SULFUR BATTERY; WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; CURRENT-COLLECTORS; COMPOSITE; ANODE; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISM; SHUTTLE	Self-discharge characteristics of Li/S cells using pure sulfur and sulfur-polypyrrole (S-PPy) cathode materials and lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) as the electrolyte salt were investigated by monitoring the open circuit voltage, the electrochemical impedance change, and the capacity loss during or after storage at room temperature. Corrosion behavior of the aluminum current collector was studied using linear sweep voltammetry and optical microscope observations of aluminum substrate in aged cells. The results showed that the cell with a pure sulfur cathode suffered from severe self-discharge, which is attributed to the corrosion of the current collector by LiTFSI and a rapid shuttle mechanism. However, a PPy coating on the surface of sulfur particles can suppress the shuttle effect, giving better self-discharge performance. LiNO3 was investigated as a suitable electrolyte additive to prevent the self-discharge of Li/S cells. A self-discharge rate of 3.1 % was obtained for a cell with an S-PPy cathode and a modified electrolyte containing 0.4 M LiNO3. It was found that LiNO3 acts both as a corrosion inhibitor and a shuttle inhibitor.

Herein, an appropriate content of sulfur was injected into a pomegranate-like structure self-assembled with nanohollows (PSSN) of N-graphene. The Li-PSSN/S battery based on traditional technology displays a large-capacity, high-rate and long-life at an ultra-high areal-sulfur loading of 10.1 mg cm(-2). The excellent performance with ultra-high areal-sulfur loading can be attributed to the hierarchal nanohollows with graphene-shells being in close contact to build a 3D-electronic conduction network and promoting electrolyte adsorption into the entire electrode to maintain rapid Li-ion transport, while stopping the shuttle-effect via the strong interaction of polysulfide with the doped N elements on graphene-shells. In addition, the exact sulfur content can provide just enough space to maintain the huge volume change and constant thickness of the S-electrodes during the charge-discharge process to enhance the cycling stability.

Passivation of the surface prevents direct contact between electrolyte and sulfur. Consequently, the mechanism of sulfur conversion is changed to a quasi-solid-state mechanism with a single sloping plateau related to sulfur conversion in the narrow pores. The narrow size of pores determines the overall pore volume of the microporous carbon and with that sulfur maximum ratio within carbon-sulfur composite. Additionally, a confinement of sulfur in the narrow pores has an impact on sulfur conversion into Li2S2/Li2S due to volumetric changes when sulfur is reduced. In this work, we show that the degree of the conversion of sulfur into end discharge products can be extended by lowering the cutoff potential during the discharge process. A higher degree of conversion process causes cracks in the carbon structure enabling a significant increase of capacity while a compact and flexible passivation layer prevents contact with the electrolyte. Quasi solid-state reduction of sulfur is kinetically more favored compared to the consequent oxidation process. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements show diffusional restrictions in the lower part of the discharge curve that can be correlated with hindered transport due to volumetric changes caused by the reduction of sulfur into Li2S2/Li2S.

The sulfur electrode is prepared from sulfur, with carbon as an electronic conductor and PEO as an ionic conductor. We changed the carbon content of a 50 wt.% sulfur electrode from 10 wt.% to 40 wt.%. The lithium/PEO/sulfur cell showed two plateau potential regions (2.4 V, 2.1 V) and high discharge capacity, i.e., 1484 mAh/g (88 % utilization) for optimum composition. The discharge capacity decreased drastically by charge-discharge cycling. The degradation rate as well as the first discharge capacity depended on the composition of the sulfur electrode. The optimum composition of the 50 wt.% sulfur electrode was 30 wt.% carbon and 20 % PEO.

Herein, electrospinning is used to prepare porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF) hosts, where both the pore volume and surface area are tailored by optimizing the sacrificial agent content and the activation temperature. Benefiting from the ameliorating functional features of high electrical conductivity, large pore volume, and Li ion permselective micropores, the PCNF/A550/S electrode activated at 550 degrees C exhibits a high sulfur loading of 71 wt%, a high capacity of 945 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, and excellent high-rate capability. The in situ transmission electron microscope examination reveals that the lithiation product, Li2S, is contained within the electrode with only approximate to 35% volume expansion and the carbon host remains intact without fracture. In contrast, the PCNF/A750/S electrode with damaged carbon spheres exhibits sulfur sublimation, a larger volume expansion of over 61%, and overflowing of Li2S, a testament to its poor cyclic stability. These findings provide, for the first time, a new insight into the correlation between volume expansion and electrochemical performance of the electrode, offering a potential design strategy to synthesize high-rate and stable LSB cathodes.

However, limited attention has been paid to whether the structure of hierarchical porous system affects the final electrochemical performance of Li-S/C batteries. Herein, we present hierarchically structured carbon (WSAC) with varied amounts of mesopores and micropores as a sulfur container for Li-S batteries. It is found that the relationship between electrochemical performance and percentage of microporous volume obeys a volcano distribution, which indicates that the volume percentage of microporous in the meso-microporous structure could be suitably tuned to achieve the desired electrochemical performance. Such S/hierarchically meso-microporous carbon (i.e., WSAC-8) with moderate microporous volume percentage (68.3%) shows high initial specific capacity (1375 mA h g(-1)) and stable charge/discharge performance (942.6 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C). In particular, WSAC-8 also presented superior capacity behavior at high rate capability, with final capacity as high as 800.1 and 758.7 mA h g(-1) for 1C and 2C, respectively.

Herein, we design and fabricate a highly uniform 3D hierarchical N-doped carbon nanoflower (NCNF) using low-cost chitosan as the nitrogen and carbon source by a silica template method. The as-prepared NCNF with abundant meso-porous channels displays a high surface area (907 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume (1.85 cm(3) g(-1)), thereby demonstrating high performance as a bifunctional material for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and in lithium-sulfur batteries. As a metal-free ORR electrocatalyst, the NCNF exhibits excellent electrochemical activity comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), and much better methanol tolerance and durability. As sulfur accommodation for a Li-S battery cathode, the NCNF high loading content of sulfur (80 wt%) achieves an extremely high capacity (1633 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C), excellent rate capability (916 mA h g(-1) at 5C) and good cycling performance with a capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1C. Even when the area density is improved to 4.5 mg(sulfur) cm(-2), the battery delivers a high areal capacity of similar to 5.5 mA h cm(-2) (0.37 mA cm(-2)) and still maintains similar to 3 mA h cm(-2) after 200 cycles with a smaller capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle at a high area current density of 3.77 mA cm(-2). Significantly, the carbon materials recycled from the Li-S cathode after 500 cycles are reused as ORR electrocatalysts, displaying more excellent electrocatalytic activity than Pt/C (20 wt%).

Hence, we skillfully designed 1D cowpea-like CNTs@Bi composites with a double adsorption structure, where the bismuth nanoparticles/nanorods are encapsulated in the cavities of CNTs, avoiding the aggregation of bismuth nanoparticles during cycling and improving the conductivity of the electrode. Meanwhile, the sulfur was evenly distributed on the surface of bismuth nanoparticles/nanorods, ensuring effective catalytic activity and displaying high sulfur loading. Under the synergetic effects of the physical detention of abundant pores and chemical adsorption of bismuth, LIPs can be minimised, effectively curbing the shuttle effect. Benefiting from the above advantages, the CNTs@Bi/S cathodes exhibit a high capacity of 1352 mA h g(-1), long cycling lifespan (708 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C) and excellent coulombic efficiency. As the anodes of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the CNTs@Bi composites also show excellent performance due to the encapsulated structure to accommodate the serious volume change. This work offers an innovative strategy for improving the performances of the Li-S batteries and LIBs.

Meso-C with large pore volume can host a large amount of sulfur and alleviate the dissolution and migration of the lithium polysulfides, while the highly conductive KB uniformly distributed within the hybrid matrix can provide fast electron transportation pathways and high specific surface area. When 62 wt% of sulfur is encapsulated, KB@Meso-C/S cathode shows the initial discharge capacity of 997 mA h g(-1), and retains 665 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 C, with 0.13% capacity decay per cycle and 97.70% Coulombic efficiency. In addition, KB@Meso-C/S cathode presents a remarkable rate capability, reaching 518 mA h g(-1) at 2 C. The hierarchical KB@Meso-C/S presents comparable performance to other complicated composites. The pore size distribution plays a major role to confine polysulfide and alleviate the shuttle effect for KB@Meso-C/S cathode.

The formation mechanism was discussed briefly, and the potential application as anode material for lithium-ion batteries was tentatively investigated. The carbon nanofibers exhibit a stable reversible capacity of 676.8 mAh/g after cycling 50 times at 0.1 C, as well as the capacities of 623.5, 463.2, and 365.8 mAh/g at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 C, respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance could be attributed to the effect of sulfur. On one hand, sulfur could improve the reversible capacity of carbon materials due to its high theoretical capacity; on the other hand, sulfur could promote the formation of the unique carbon nanofibers with the graphene layers perpendicular to the axis direction, favorable to shortening the Li-ion diffusion path.

The commercial feasibility of Li-S batteries is still in question due to the usage of a highly reactive Li-metal anode and complex electrochemistry of the sulfur cathode. We demonstrate here a sulfur battery that is free of both the lithium-metal anode and sulfurelement (S-8) cathode. Instead of a carbonaceous material, a lithiated anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle is chosen here as the anode. A freestanding pellet of lithium sulfide and carbon aerogel (Li2S/CA) is used as the cathode in the Li-metal-free sulfur battery. Activation of Li2S and its conversion to S-8 are confirmed by in operando Raman spectroscopy. UV-vis spectroscopy clearly shows high retention of intermediate polysulfides inside the Li2S/CA pellet.

In this work, uniform yolk-shell Fe3O4@nitrogen-doped carbon composites are synthesized by combining polymerization of o-phenylenediamine (oPD) with core-shell Fe3O4@SiO2 nanospheres, followed by pyrolysis of poly (o-phenylenediamine) (PoPD) and removal of silica. This novel composites exhibit superior lithium storage capacity and cycling stability due to their unique yolk-shell structure and nitrogen-doped carbon shell, which provide ample space to accommodate the volume expansion of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, prevent the aggregation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and enhance the electron conductivity during cycling. This newly developed method can be employed in other yolk-shell structural design of hybrids with high-performance for lithium-ion or lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of Sulfur and Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotube Composite Synthesized by Dissolution and Precipitation for Li/S Batteries	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Sulfur; MWNT; Sulfur Composite; Li/S Battery	ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; CATHODE; PERFORMANCE; CELL	An elemental sulfur and multi-walled carbon nanotube (S-MWNT) composite was synthesized by dissolving sulfur in ammonium sulfides and then precipitating on MWNT. Morphology observation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that S-MWNT product was successfully prepared by incorporating sulfur into MWNT network. Without additional conducting material, the S-MWNT composite cathodes were prepared for electrochemical tests. The properties measured in discharge-charge cycling test showed that the composite had the initial discharge capacity of 1024 mAh g(-1), which is about 61% sulfur utilization. However, in the subsequent cycling, the capacities faded. To determine the reason of rapid capacity drop, S-MWNT composite cathodes were compared in the cycling tests with varying three kinds of electrolytes and the cathode was subjected to physical force by rolling. The changes in the cycle performances proved that the deterioration of S-MWNT composite cathodes was not related to the electrolytes but to physical bonding that may not maintain the conducting path between sulfur and MWNT.

Benefiting from their branched molecular architecture, SIVHPs presented excellent solubility in polar organic solvents with an ultrahigh concentration of 400 mg mL(-1). After end-capping by sequential click chemistry of thiol-ene and Menschutkin quaternization reactions, we obtained water soluble SIVHPs for the first time. The sulfur-rich SIVHPs were employed as solution processible cathode-active materials for Li-S batteries, by facile fluid infiltration into conductive frameworks of graphene-based ultralight aerogels (GUAs). The SIVHPs-based cells showed high initial specific capacities of 1247.6 mA h g(-1) with 400 charge-discharge cycles. The cells also demonstrated an excellent rate capability and a considerable depression of shuttle effect with stable coulombic efficiency of around 100%. The electrochemical performance of SIVHP in Li-S batteries overwhelmed the case of neat sulfur, due to the chemical fixation of sulfur. The combination of high solubility, structure flexibility, and superior electrochemical performance opens a door for the promising application of SIVHPs.

The conductive/porous MVVCNT-coating functions (i) as an upper current collector to facilitate electron transport and high active-material utilization and (ii) as a filter to intercept/absorb the migrating polysulfides and thereby suppress the polysulfide diffusion. Also, the access to the electrolyte through the porous network of MWCNT along with its fast electronic transport facilitates the reutilization of the trapped active material and superior long-term cyclability. The MVVCNT-coating is lightweight (0.17 mg cm(-2)), yet allows the successful use of regular sulfur cathodes (high sulfur content of 70 wt %) with high discharge capacity, excellent rate performance, and long cycle life, demonstrating that the MWCNT-coated separator is a viable solution to practical Li-S batteries.

Hence, we designed and prepared tin oxide hydroxide quantum dots (TOH) anchored on a honeycomb porous carbon (HPC) matrix as multifunctional sulfur hosts, and deeply studied the enhancement of TOH on the reaction kinetics of Li-S battery referred to as the apparent activation energy, Li+ ion diffusion coefficient, and reaction barrier. It is proved by density functional theory that the HPC@TOH hosts have a higher binding energy to polysulfides than the simplex carbon matrix. Meanwhile, the catalytic TOH can decrease the surface active energy of the redox reaction and accelerate the conversion of sulfur-containing species. Consequently, by means of the synergistic effects of physical capture and chemical adsorption together with catalytic conversion, the comprehensive performances of Li-S batteries are distinctly promoted. In particular, a Li-S battery using HPC@TOH as a host delivers a good reversible specific capacity of 1342.95 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. Moreover, with the current increased to 1 C, it shows a relatively satisfactory specific capacity of 918.05 mAh g(-1). After 400 cycles, a competitive specific capacity of 688.54 mAh g(-1) can still be maintained with a very low fading rate of 0.06% per cycle. Most importantly, when the sulfur areal loading reaches as high as 4.25 mg cm(-2) and electrolyte/sulfur ratio is controlled to be as low as 7 mu L mg(-1), and the Li-S battery using HPC@TOH as a host can still cycle steadily more than 50 cycles at 0.2 C. Therefore, this work provides an effective manner to boost the comprehensive performance of Li-S batteries by virtue of optimizing and designing the host material with synergistic effects of physical capture, chemical adsorption, and catalytic conversion.

However, the rebellious dendrites growth leads to the low Coulombic efficiency and safety hazards, which has been a key challenge in the application of Li metal anode. Herein, the ZnF2/ZnS heterostructures and N-doped carbon decorated porous carbon nanofibers (ZnF2/ZnS/NC/PCNFs) are fabricated through the electro-blow spinning (EBS), metal-organic framework (MOF)-assisted method, and carbonization process. And its application performances as coating functional interlayer of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) to suppress the Li dendrites growth are systematically researched. The conductive interconnected skeleton of NC/PCNFs provides convenient electrons/ions transmission channels and reduces local current density. The lithiophilic ZnF2 and ZnS nanoparticles can trigger similar alloying reaction with Li-ions to guide the uniform Li deposition. In particular, the inbuilt electric field triggered at the interface of ZnF2/ZnS heterostructures improves charge transfer and surface reaction kinetics. Combining with these merits, the Li|LiFePO4 (Li|LFP) cells with ZnF2/ZnS/NC/PCNFs deliver an optimal initial discharge capacity of 143.2 mAh g-1 and capacity retention rate of 93.6% after 600 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, the Li|Li symmetric cells show lower overpotential than that without the interlayer. Extraordinarily, the lithium-sulfur (Li|S) cells with ZnF2/ZnS/NC/PCNFs also display excellent cycle stability due to the strong captured or adsorbed ability to dissolved lithium polysulfides. All these results reveal that the utilization of the ZnF2/ZnS/NC/PCNFs interlayer provides new insight for protecting the Li metal anode and improving the electrochemical properties and safety of LMBs.

TiO2 @TiN nanoparticles are found to be uniformly distributed on three dimensional well connected nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (CNFs) which provide extra chemical adsorption sites and continuous electron transfer pathways. With the synergistic effect of TiO2@TiN and CNFs, TiO2 @TiN/CNFs cathode shows exceptionally excellent rate capability by delivering 950 mAh g(-1) at current density of 5 mA cm(-2) with sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2). High sulfur utilization by maintaining 6.41 mAh cm(-2) after 200 cycles with sulfur loading of 8.0 mg cm(-2) is observed. The cycling stability is also confirmed by the discharge capacity of 800 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles with sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm(-2). Moreover, the in-situ conversion, adsorption-conversion and desorption-conversion mechanisms are proposed and confirmed by symmetric batteries and full batteries.

Herein, we designed a separator comprising polypropylene (PP) coated with MoO3 nanobelts (MNBs), prepared through facile grinding of commercial MoO3 powder. The formation of Li2Sn-MoO3 during discharging inhibited the polysulfide shuttling; during charging, Li passivated LixMoO3 facilitated ionic transfer during the redox reaction by decreasing the charge transfer resistance. This dual-interaction mechanism of LiPSwith both Mo and the formation of Li(x)MoO(3)resulted in a substantially high initial discharge capacity at a very high current density of 5C, with 29.4% of the capacity retained after 5000 cycles. The simple fabrication approach and extraordinary cycle life observed when using this MNB-coated separator suggest a scalable solution for future commercialization of LSBs.

The RGONs were prepared by the Hummers method and reduced to different oxygen contents using hydrazine monohydrate by adjusting the reduction temperature. The effect of the content of RGONs on the mechanical properties and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness of the composites was investigated. Results indicate that in contrast to the detrimental effect of GO on the flexural and thermal properties, the addition of RGONs improves the mechanical property and EMI shielding effectiveness of the composites without sacrificing their thermal properties. RGONs with a relatively lower oxygen content show more apparent mechanical reinforcement while RGONs with a relatively higher oxygen content show a more obvious improvement on EMI shielding effectiveness. The improved interfacial properties are mainly ascribed to the toughening effects of the RGONs.

Although some S doped covalent framework cathodes have been reported with outstanding reversibility, the low content of sulfur (less than 30%) limits the practical applications. To overcome the issue, the sulfur and nitrogen co-doped covalent compounds (S-NC) as a host-type cathode have been developed through the radical transfer process during thermal cracking amino groups on the precursor, and then plentiful positively charged sulfur radicals can be controllably introduced. The experimental characterization and DFT theoretical calculation certificate that the sulfur radicals in S-NC/S can expedite redox reactions of intermediate polysulfides to impede their dissolution. Moreover, the energy barriers during ions transfer also obviously decreased after introducing S radicals, which lead to improved rate performance.

The preliminary investigation of the reaction mechanism, based on X-ray diffraction measurements, indicates the occurrence of both conversion and alloying-dealloying reactions in the Mn-Sn bimetallic oxide electrode. Moreover, Mn-Sn BO//LiCoO2 Li-ion full cells were successfully assembled for the first time, and found to deliver a relatively high energy density of 176.25 Wh.kg(-1) at 16.35 W.kg(-1) (based on the total weight of anode and cathode materials). The superior long-term stability of these materials might be attributed to their nanoscale size and unique mesoporous nanocubic structure, which provide short Li+ diffusion pathways and a high contact area between electrolyte and active material. In addition, the Mn-Sn BOs could be used as advanced sulfur hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries, owing to their adequate mesoporous structure and relatively strong chemisorption of lithium polysulfide. The present results thus highlight the promising potential of mesoporous Mn-Sn bimetallic oxides for application in Li-ion and Li-S batteries.

Too often, the barrier for implementing them in large-scale EES is the unfettered migration of redox active species across the membrane, which shortens battery life and reduces Coulombic efficiency. To advance RFBs for reliable EES, a new paradigm for controlling membrane transport selectivity is needed. We show here that size- and ion-selective transport can be achieved using membranes fabricated from polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs). As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a first-generation PIM membrane dramatically reduced polysulfide crossover (and shuttling at the anode) in lithium sulfur batteries, even when sulfur cathodes were prepared as flowable energy-dense fluids. The design of our membrane platform was informed by molecular dynamics simulations of the solvated structures of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonypimide (LiTFSI) vs lithiated polysulfides (Li2Sx, where x = 8, 6, and 4) in glyme-based electrolytes of different oligomer length. These simulations suggested polymer films with pore dimensions less than 1.2-1.7 nm might incur the desired ion-selectivity. Indeed, the polysulfide blocking ability of the PIM-1 membrane (similar to 0.8 nm pores) was improved 500-fold over mesoporous Celgard separators (similar to 17 nm pores). As a result, significantly improved battery performance was demonstrated, even in the absence of LiNO3 anode-protecting additives.

However, conventional slurry-coating- and vacuum-filtration-designed barriers usually show poor particle connection and require extra binder. Herein, we propose a facile in situ growth method and a subsequent compression strategy to design multifunctional NiCo2S4 (NiCoS) nanosheet arrays on a PP membrane for high-performance Li-S batteries. The in situ grown NiCoS nanosheet arrays are interconnected, conductive and closely adhered to the PP membrane without using any binder. After mechanical compression treatment, the overall NiCoS film is compacted, lightweight (0.148 mg cm(-2)) and ultrathin (0.8 mu m). Density functional theory calculations combined with adsorption and diffusion tests prove that the NiCoS nanosheets have highly efficient physical/chemical entrapping capabilities for preventing polysulfide shuttling. Moreover, in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that the NiCoS barrier could efficiently suppress polysulfide diffusion and concurrently facilitate redox reactions. When applying this multifunctional separator, a sulfur/carbon nanotube (S/CNT) cathode with high sulfur content (75 wt%) delivers significantly improved long-term cycling performance, with 0.056% capacity decay per cycle over 500 cycles. This work opens up new opportunities to design multifunctional separators by an in situ growth strategy for high-performance Li-S batteries.

This simple method can effectively suppress the generation of solid and insulated Li2S deposition while reserves the majority of capacity and improves the cyclic stability of Li-S pouch cells. Upon increasing the discharging cutoff voltage from 1.6 to 2.0 V, the Li-S pouch cell loses only 8% of the initial discharge capacity and remarkably promotes the capacity retention rate from 62.4 to 91.6% within 40 cycles at 0.05C. The analysis of electrochemistry and physics of a sulfur cathode demonstrates that the less Li2S deposition under the discharging cutoff voltage of 2.0 V can ensure fast reaction kinetics in Li-S pouch cells with high areal sulfur loadings and lean electrolyte. The mechanism of the passivation of a sulfur electrode is studied and discussed in detail. This brand new methodology may provide an effective approach to enhance the cyclic stability of a Li-S battery.

Less attention has been paid to their use in Li-S batteries in spite of the higher energy densities. Here, we optimized the electrochemical properties of an activated carbon (OSAC) obtained from olive stones with the help of mesoporous TiO2. The OSAC@TiO2/S hybrid composite exhibited improved electrochemical performance compared with the OSAC/S composite. The presence of TiO2 increased the delivered capacity of the cell by more than 60%, and the rate capability was notably improved. The cell could operate at current densities of 3350 mA g(-1) (2 C), releasing an average capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency close to 100%. This improvement in the electrochemical performance is attributed to the sorbent properties of TiO2 towards Li polysulfides and its facility to insert Li, which enhances the electronic and ionic conductivity of the hybrid composite.

The exquisite sensitivity of the Li-S system to various experimental parameters speaks to the importance of directing future research towards the entire Li-S-battery set-up, rather than just some components. The main overall goal should be to produce cells with high specific energy and energy density. These are challenging tasks and more work is required, in particular in the area of cell engineering. The achievements spotlighted in this report show that outstanding results can be obtained by suitably engineering cathodes and other cell parts, without the need to use advanced structured hosts for sulfur. A lot of stimulating, original and successful research has been done recently in the field, leading to satisfying Li-S battery performances and paving the way for more applied research, with the goal of entering a pre-application phase in Li-S battery development.

As confirmed by experimental results, both the improved the rate and cycle performances of Li-S batteries cathode with gradient sulfur immobilization, are mainly attributed to the confining, adsorption and conduction multi-functions of as-prepared carbon spheres toward polysulfides. Specifically, on starting the discharging/charging cycles, the active material alpha-S-8 is irreversibly converted to polysulfides and then transformed between beta-S-8 and polysulfides during the next charge/discharge cycles. After initialization at 0.1C for 3 cycles, the initial reversible discharge capacities of the Li-S batteries cathode with optimized sulfur amount are 1072.5, 831.3, 780.4, 726.8, 714.3, 702.7 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 C, which is superior to those of the most previously reported reports. Besides that, as-designed potato-derived carbon based composite cathodes exhibits remarkable rate performance and cycling stability even at wide temperature ranging from -40 to 60 degrees C, which evidently supports the dominant role of as-prepared 3D carbon spheres in boosting the cathode performance for Li-S batteries.

Herein, we exploit a salt-templated CVD approach to harness the direct synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) nanosheets and related ink dispersions in a scalable, safe, efficient, and green fashion. Thus-fabricated NG accompanying large productivity, excellent electrical conductivity, and favorable solution processability possesses implications in printable energy storage devices. With the NG-based ink in hand, self-standing 3D architectures with programmable patterns can be directly printed over a myriad of substrates. Accordingly, both electrode preparation for flexible supercapacitors and separator modification in Li-S batteries can be enabled via printing by employing our NG-based composite inks. This work thus represents a practical route for mass production of graphene inks with cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness for emerging energy storage technology.

The PCNF film with a 3D interconnected structure is used as a conducting matrix to encapsulate sulfur. In addition, the introduction of Cu leads to the formation of a chemical bond between Cu and S, preventing the dissolution of polysulfide during cycling. The micropores and mesopores of PCNF hosts provide free space to accommodate the volume change of S and polysulfide. When used as a cathode material for Li-S batteries, the S@PCNFs-Cu (S content: 52 wt%) exhibits much better electrochemical performance compared to the Cu-free S@PCNF electrode. The S@PCNFsCu displays high reversible capacity (680 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 50 mA g(-1)), excellent rate capability (415 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1) and super Coulombic efficiency of 100%. This strategy of stabilizing S with a small amount of copper nanoparticles can be a very promising method to prepare free-standing cathode material for high-performance Li-S batteries.

To validate the use of these compounds as solid-state electrolytes, their stabilities versus Li and Li-In alloy are tested in symmetrical cells and their electrochemical stability windows are studied by cyclic voltammetry. We show that LiCe(BH4)(3)Cl is the more stable phase without any formation of a resistive layer upon cycling. All-solid-state Li-S batteries using a carbon-sulfur composite as the positive electrode material are then assembled using LiCe(BH4)(3)Cl as the electrolyte. Reversible electrochemical reaction between Li and sulfur takes place at 45 degrees C with an initial discharge capacity of 1186 mAh/g of S under a current density of 13 mu A/cm(2) (i.e. a rate of charge/discharge of C/100). The capacity retention is significant with still a value of 510 mAh/g after 9 cycles showing for the first time the possible use of LiCe(BH4)(3)Cl as solid electrolyte of Li-S batteries.

For this system, the availability of raw materials and simplicity (high efficiency) of synthetic strategies are also important factors. Herein, we propose an interlaced two-dimensional (2D) carbon material as advanced Li-S cathode host characterized by corrugated monolithic morphology and Co/N dopants as dual lithiophilic-sulfiphilic sites. This 2D structure is derived from a cheap biomass precursor, adenine, with bonding interaction with a MgCl2 hydrate template via a facile ionothermal method. It allows a homogeneous spatial distribution of S/Li2S deposits and strong adsorbability and enhanced conversion from the synergistic effects of corrugated 2D conductive matrix and embedded heteroatom/nanodot catalyst, the resultant sulfur cathode releases a high specific capacity of 1290.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, small capacity fading rate of 0.029% per cycle over 600 cycles at 2 C, superior rate performance up to 20 C, and considerable areal capacity retention of 6.0 mA h cm(-2) even under an ultrahigh sulfur loading up to 9.7 mg cm(-2).

Herein, we report a simple and ultrafast approach to produce TiO2/C nanocomposite. Multilayered Ti3C2Tx, i.e. MXenes material, was oxidized into TiO2/C nanocomposite under microwave irradiation in 20 seconds. The resulting TiO2/C nanocomposite have a multilayer carbon structure and the TiO2 crystals are embedded in the carbon layer. The interlayered TiO2 could effectively prevent the restacking of carbon flakes. As an electrode material, the special structure of TiO2/C can increase the diffusion channel of ions and improve the transmission of electrons. Therefore, the TiO2/C nanocomposite exhibit good cycle stability. The TiO2/C nanocomposite are expected to be used for other electrode materials, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries and photoelectrocatalysis devices.

J	Li, F; Zhao, JJ				Li, Fen; Zhao, Jijun			Three dimensional porous SiC for lithium polysulfide trapping	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; HIGH-CAPACITY; LONG-LIFE; SULFUR; CARBON; GRAPHENE; CATHODE; BATTERY; PERFORMANCE; ULTRAFAST	One of the key issues in lithium sulfur batteries is the fast capacity fade induced by the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) migration. Hence, a series of three-dimensional (3D) porous SiC materials with active sp(2) Si atoms have been designed for lithium polysulfide entrapping in Li-S batteries. The ZGM-SiC-1 and AGM-SiC-3 have been confirmed to be thermodynamically and dynamically stable from the formation energy and phonon dispersion spectrum, meanwhile showing good mechanical properties. The moderate band gaps suggest fast electron transport during the charge-discharge cycles of the Li-S batteries, especially in ZGM-SiC-1. The 3D porous ZGM-SiC-1 and AGM-SiC-3 display strong affinity to S-8 and LiPS with the direct Si-S and Li-C interactions, which are comparable to the case of the N doped carbon host. As compared to the 3D pristine graphene monoliths and two dimensional SiC nanosheet, the entrapping of LiPS in the 3D porous SiC host is much stronger (ca. 2.5 eV to 3.5 eV), which is effective in inhibiting the shutter effect in Li-S batteries. Most interestingly, the extraordinarily strong adsorption of the S-8 molecule indicates high sulfur loading in the 3D porous SiC host.

Lithium sulfide is the fully lithiated form of sulfur, i.e., they share the same high theoretical capacity. However, it has the benefit of already containing lithium, which allows making cells with lithium-free negative electrodes. Lithium sulfide, however, shares with sulfur the polysulfide dissolution drawback upon cycling. One possible solution to this problem is to envelop the active material particles with carbonaceous materials. In this work, we investigate the effect of a nitrogen-rich carbon coating on lithium sulfide particles. The effect of such coating on the surface properties and electrochemistry of lithium sulfide cathodes is investigated in details, in particular, regarding its interaction with fresh vs. aged electrolyte. The polymerization of dioxalane (DOL) due to aging is found to affect the electrochemistry of lithium sulfide and, interestingly, to improve the cycling performance.

Burning of waste rubber products emits toxic gases, and recycling of rubber by breaking the C-S bond with costly reagents and heat is also haunted by environmental concerns. The crosslinked polymers can be extracted chemically at room temperature and, by a simple solution-drop method, used to prepare a bifunctional cathode layer on the cathode current collector of a Li-S battery. The C-S bond of the crosslinking sulfur can be broken reversibly in a discharge/recharge cycle to provide a sulfur source, and the broken carbon bond can capture a lithium polysulfide soluble in a liquid organic electrolyte by forming a C-Li-S bond during discharge. During charge, the Li is extracted and the C-S bond is reformed. However, added sulfur powder is also needed in the cathode of a Li-S battery. The data also provide a low-cost way to recycle waste rubber electrochemically.

S/PAN/KB was dehydrogenated at 300 degrees C without carbonizing and used as a cathode without any binder/current collector. The SEM observations of the obtained S/DPAN/KB nanofibers showed that the fiber diameters were in a range of 300-600 nm and the sample had a rough surface due to the presence of the S/KB particles. According to the SEM/EDS analysis sulfur is uniformly distributed within PAN fibers in both S/PAN/KB and S/DPAN/KB (heat treated) composites. The prepared binder-free S/DPAN/KB composite cathode exhibited a good electrochemical performance delivering a reversible capacity of 917 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles, exhibiting a coulombic efficiency about 100%, and demonstrating stable cyclability and good rate capability with a reversible capacity of 342 mA h g(-1) at 1 C. The obtained composite cathode is highly flexible and can be used for LIB powering flexible electronic devices. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

Both situations lead to a low actual capacity of the Li-S pouch cells with a high S loading but are ignored for coin cells.

By controlling the discharge/charge capacity separately, symmetric oscillation (SOS) and asymmetric oscillation (ASOS) protocols were performed to facilitate the infiltration of electrolyte into the S cathode and restrict the formed lithium polysulfide in the cathode region. For SOS formation, the batteries were discharged/charged above 2.4 V with the same (symmetric) capacity with 2.78 x 10(-3) Hz of oscillation frequency (similar to 1.4 mAh/g for SOS-500), in which the polysulfide dissolution was suppressed effectively. For ASOS formation, 100% discharge capacity (also similar to 1.4 mAh/g for ASOS-500) and 92% charge capacity are set in each oscillation period, which leads to better activation effect but more shuttling polysulfides than SOS. Compared with SOS protocol, for ASOS protocol, more oxidative S (instead of polysulfides) inside original nonactivated cathode will be preferentially reduced in the next discharging process, but all the accumulated polysulfides during discharge of activation are oxidized into elemental S in the final charging process. These efficient formation protocols increase the practical capacity by up to 160% after 50 cycles without any change in pouch cell assembly.

The novel carbon-sulfur nano-composite material was synthesized by heating sublimed sulfur and high surface area activated carbon (HSAAC) in certain conditions. Equivalent circuits were used to fit the spectra at different discharge states. The variations of impedance spectra, charge-transfer resistance and double layer capacitance were discussed. The changes of EIS with potential were analyzed based on a plausible electrical equivalent circuit model, and some parameters were measured and analyzed about electrochemical performance and state of charge and discharge of the electrode. The good accuracy in fitting values of the model to the experimental data indicates that the mathematical model gives out a satisfying description upon the mechanism of high rate of capacity fade in lithium-sulfur battery.

This metal is used as binding matrix for the sulfur particles and thereby makes any binder and conducting carbon additives redundant. Furthermore, it serves by itself as the current collector, so that all functionalities (current collector, binder and electrical conductor towards sulfur) are fulfilled by the electroformed metal, while modified sulfur particles are directly incorporated (composite electroformation). In this way, the sulfur cathode can be produced in a single continuous step in form of a metal foil with adjustable thickness and sulfur loading. The process requires functionalization of sulfur to improve its wettability, incorporation homogeneity and volume which is provided by wrapping sulfur particles with polythiophene. Electroformed copper-sulfur composite foils are chosen as a first proof of the new concept. The achieved battery capacity, cycling stability and coulombic efficiency are presented. It is shown that the electroformed copper-sulfur composite foil operates very well as a battery cathode and a discharge capacity of over 400 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.5 C over 100 cycles is preserved.

The selective oxidation of H2S by a nitrogen-enriched mesoporous carbon catalyst can produce elemental sulfur as a by-product which in-situ deposit onto the carbon framework. Due to the metal-free catalytic characteristic and high catalytic selectivity, the resulting sulfur/carbon composites have almost no impurities that thus can be used as cathode materials with compromising battery performance. The layer-by-layer sulfur deposition allows atomic sulfur binding strongly with carbon framework, providing efficient immobilization of sulfur. The nitrogen atoms doped on the carbon framework can increase the surface interactions with polysulfides, leading to the improvement in the trapping of polysulfides. Thus, the composites exhibit a reversible capacity of 939 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and an excellent rate capability of 527 mAh g(-1) at 5 C after 70 cycles.

However, the low active material utilization and the short cycle life, which stem from the poor conductivity and the polysulfide dissolution-diffusion problem, hinder the further application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a combined interface engineering approach, which includes an ion-selective sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membrane and a freestanding single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) interlayer, has been demonstrated successfully to enhance the performance of Li-S batteries with a Li2S cathode. The SPEEK membrane is integrated into the Li2S cathode, functioning as both a barrier of the polysulfides and a highway for Li+ ions, due to its negatively charged ionic nanochannels which have been proved to mediate high-speed ion transport. With SPEEK, the cell presents high rate performance (above 400 mA h g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)). Furthermore, to balance the conductivity of ions and electrons, a SWCNT/rGO interlayer is inserted between the cathode and the separator to improve the electronic conductivity, block the polysulfides, and provide space for sustained electrochemical reactions, resulting in improved capacity and life. With the interlayer, a high capacity of 620 mA h g(-1) is retained after 80 cycles.

Therefore, a MnO decorated Nitrogen doped carbon/CNT (MnO/N-C/CNT) composite is synthesized and used as the barrier and accelerator for LPSs. The bi-metal Zn/Mn-MOF is firstly grown on carbon nanotubes (CNT) by a facile chemical reaction of Zn(NO3)(2)/Mn(NO3) and dimethylimidazole, then the precursor is calcined in nitrogen ambient at 910 degrees C to fabricate MnO/N-C/CNT composite. After coating on the polypropylene separator, the MnO/N-C/CNT layer can greatly alliviate the shuttle effect by its dual function. The N-C/CNT network can provide good conductivity and physical barrier, while the polar MnO can enhance the chemical adsorption and conversion rate for LPSs. As a result, when the sulfur areal loading is 3.5mg/cm(2), an impressive specific capacity of 950 mAh/g at 0.5C is obtained by use of MnO/N-C/CNT modified separator, and it can cycle steadily for over 500 cycles at an average decay rate of 0.022%/cycle. Furthermore, the battery also displays a cycle stability for over 200 cycles even under the sulfur areal loading of 5.5mg/cm(2), which demonstrate its application potential.

After that, elemental sulfur particles were grown in situ on the surface of the hollow carbon nanospheres by a solution method to prepare HCNS/S composites. RESULTS The morphology and crystal structure of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical performance of the samples was tested by constant charge and discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectra using coin 2032 half batteries. The electrochemical tests indicated that the as-prepared HCNS/S composites exhibited an initial specific capacity of 1162 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.2 C. CONCLUSION The electrochemical impedance spectra showed that the as-prepared HCNS/S composites displayed superior electronic conductivity during electrochemical cycles.

Here we report an approach that does not rely on sulfur encapsulation. We used a low-surface-area, open carbon fibre architecture to control the nucleation and growth of the sulfur species by manipulating the carbon surface chemistry and the solvent properties, such as donor number and Li+ diffusivity. Our approach facilitates the formation of large open spheres and prevents the production of an undesired insulating sulfur-containing film on the carbon surface. This mechanism leads to similar to 100% sulfur utilization, almost no capacity fading, over 99% coulombic efficiency and high energy density (1,835 Wh kg(-1) and 2,317 Wh l(-1)). This finding offers an alternative approach for designing high-energy and low-cost Li-S batteries through controlling sulfur reaction on low-surface-area carbon.

Herein, a totally green and straightforward synthesis strategy for the fabrication of hierarchically porous carbon nanotubes (HPCNTs) by a simple carbonization treatment without any assistance of soft/hard templates and activation procedures is demonstrated. A high specific surface area of 1419 m(2) g(-1) and hierarchical micro-/meso-/macroporosity can be achieved for the HPCNTs. The unique porous architecture enables the HPCNTs serving as excellent electrode/host materials for high-performance supercapacitors and Li-sulfur batteries. The design strategy may pave a new avenue for the rational synthesis of hierarchically porous carbon nanostructures for high-efficient energy storage applications.

On the basis of total energy calculations, the atomic structure of the oxygenated surface is proposed, and the effect of surface reconstruction on the electronic properties of the surface is clarified. While bare LFP(010) surface is insulating, adsorption of oxygen leads to the emergence of semimetallic behavior by inducing the conducting states in the band gap of the system. The physical origin of these conducting states is investigated. We further demonstrate that deposition of Li2S layers on top of oxygenated LFP(010) surface leads to the formation of additional conducting hole states in the first layer of Li2S surface because of the charge transfer from sulfur p-states to the gap states of LFP surface. This demonstrates that oxygenated LIP surface not only provides conducting layers itself, but also induces conducting channels in the top layer of Li2S. These results help to achieve further understanding of potential role of LFP particles in improving the performance of Li-S batteries through emergent interface conductivity.

Although various approaches have recently been pursued with Li2S to obtain high performance, formidable challenges still remain with cell design (e.g., low Li2S loading, insufficient Li2S content, and an excess electrolyte) to realize high areal, gravimetric, and volumetric capacities. This study demonstrates a shell-shaped carbon architecture for holding pure Li2S, offering innovation in cell-design parameters and gains in electrochemical characteristics. The Li2S core-carbon shell electrode encapsulates the redox products within the conductive shell so as to facilitate facile accessibility to electrons and ions. The fast redox-reaction kinetics enables the cells to attain the highest Li2S loading of 8 mg cm(-2) and the lowest electrolyte/Li2S ratio of 9/1, which is the best cell-design specifications ever reported with Li2S cathodes so far. Benefiting from the excellent cell-design criterion, the core-shell cathodes exhibit stable cyclability from slow to fast cycle rates and, for the first time, simultaneously achieve superior performance metrics with areal, gravimetric, and volumetric capacities.

The FT-IR and Raman spectra illustrated the chemical effect between PANI and GO, and the SEM images illustrated the tight connection with each other. As a cathode for Li-S batteries, the S@PANI/GO composite demonstrated better electrochemical performance than S@PANI, or S/GO composites. The S@PANI/GO composite delivered enhanced cycle stability (0.2 C, 875 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles) and high-rate capability (4 C, 466 mA h g(-1)). Even at 1 C, the S@PANI/GO composite still delivered a capacity of 641 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles. The enhanced performance should benefit from the core-shell structure with a synergistic effect between polyaniline and graphene oxide.

An electrode caster and a modified hot rolling compressor were assembled to continuously spread the precursors and generate nanocrystals of MOF, respectively. Co nanoparticles wrapped within N-doped porous carbon (Co@NPC) are formed after calcination and serve as powerful "anchors" to greatly enhance the charge transfer kinetics and completeness of Li2Sx -> Li2S conversion, largely improving the utilization of S. With unmodified S electrodes, the functionalized interlayer achieves a near theoretical capacity of 1618 mA h g(-1) in the first cycle at 1 C, which retains 1064 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles; under increased S loading levels of 5.8 and 13.4 mg cm(-2), it exhibits 1010 and 710 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, 113% and 295% those obtained by the bare counterpart. The scalable protocol of MOF and MOF-derived functionalization can be easily performed on versatile substrates and may find applications in other electrochemical materials and devices.

Loose macroporous structures have been proposed by many to improve sulfur utilization and areal capacity. However, their low cathode sulfur densities and high electrolyte fractions lead to low cell volumetric and gravimetric capacities. We report here a compact free-standing Li-S cathode structure that delivers areal, volumetric and gravimetric capacities all exceeding those of typical Li-ion batteries. The cathodes, formed by pressure filtration of the constituents, are composed of highly micro/mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (NCNSs) embedded in the macropores of a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) network to form a dense structure. The MWCNT network facilitates low cathode impedance. The NCNSs maximize sulfur utilization and immobilization. These collectively result in high cathode volumetric capacity (1106 mA h cm(-3)) and low electrolyte requirement (6 mu L mg(-1) of sulfur), which together lead to high cell-level gravimetric capacity. Stable long-term cycling at 0.3C (2.5 mA cm(-2) for 5 mg cm(-2) areal sulfur-loading) has also been achieved, with the areal and volumetric capacities of the best remaining above typical Li-ion values over 270 cycles and the per-cycle capacity fading being only 0.1%. The facile preparation means significant potential for large scale use.

However, owing to the limited understanding on the complex growth mechanism and non-linear kinetics, rational design of growth procedures and related multiphase reactors for the production of the hybrids remain great challenges. In this contribution, the in-situ monitoring of graphene/CNT hybrid synthesis on layered double oxide bifunctional catalysts was carried out in an online thermogravimetric reactor. The rapid growth of CNTs occurred at the initial 90 s and the slow deposition of graphene was throughout the whole process, becoming the dominant reaction in the second stage. Based on this unique growth behavior, a two-stage growth strategy was proposed to improve the quality of hybrid products. The deposition of amorphous carbon byproduct was significantly suppressed and the quality of the hybrids was significantly enhanced through the two-stage growth process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to the well-defined 2D morphology, nanometer-scale thickness, high specific surface area, and the simultaneous doping of the metal-nitrogen compounds, the as-prepared catalysts exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and acidic media. More importantly, such a self-templating approach towards two-dimensional porous carbon hybrids with diverse metal-nitrogen doping opens up new avenues to mesoporous heteroatom-doped carbon materials as electrochemical catalysts for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution, with promising applications in fuel cell and battery technologies.

Unfortunately, the high loading of insulating sulfur usually inevitably leads to low sulfur utilization, poor rate properties, and rapid capacity fading. To address this challenge, this work presents a facile MgO templating route to fabricate hierarchical carbon films (HCFs), which are assembled from 1D fibrous matrix and 2D leaf-like structures. When used as cathode without extra binders or conductive additives, the integrated HCF-S composite film with -3 mg cm(-2) sulfur exhibits excellent rate performance (4.05 mAh cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) and 3.4 mAh cm-2 at 5 mA cm(-2)) and cycling stability. Even the sulfur content is up to 80.9 wt % and 10.5 mg cm(-2), HCF-S obtained 9.13 mAh cm(-2) after 50 cycles at 2 mA cm(-2).

In particular, the design of a porous architecture is the key to manipulating their function, thereby promoting the practicality. This paper suggests a simple and scalable synthetic process to prepare mesostructured porous carbon derived by pseudo metal-organic coordination. Inspired by metal-organic framework synthesis, the zinc ion is selected to function as both a mesostructure inducer and self-vanishing porogen, thereby enabling the direct carbonization of non-carbonizable precursors without complicated and environmental burden steps. The resulting porous carbon materials possess mesostructured morphologies, resembling diverse metal oxide crystals with distinct pore architectures, which can be tailored for various applications. Furthermore, the functionalities of the resulting mesostructured porous carbon are demonstrated by evaluating the adsorption behavior for large molecules and the electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode for Li-S batteries.

The proposed micromechanical method predicts the relaxation properties of polymer hybrid nanocomposites containing linearly visco-elastic matrix, transversely isotropic elastic carbon fibers, and graphene nanoplatelets. Calculations performed in this model are of two scales. The small scale, which is the domain of epoxy resin and graphene nanoplatelet interactions, and the large scale, which assumes the small scale as a homogenized isotropic matrix. In the large scale, the prescribed matrix is then reinforced by the unidirectional CFs. Each scale calculation gives the properties of the underlying material. Secant moduli and the field fluctuation techniques are adopted in this study. Resulting explicit formulae allows one to calculate the overall relaxation moduli of the graphene nanoplatelet/carbon fiber-reinforced polymer hybrid nanocomposites. By comparing the data obtained by experiments and the results extracted by the proposed micromechanical approach, the accuracy of the model becomes apparent. Addition of graphene nanoplatelets into the fibrous composites leads to an improvement in the relaxation properties of the hybrid nanocomposites. Also, the elastic properties of graphene nanoplatelet/carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy hybrid nanocomposites are reported. The role of graphene nanoplatelet agglomeration, frequently encountered in real engineering situations, in the mechanical response of unidirectional hybrid nanocomposites is examined. The effects of volume fraction of graphene nanoplatelets and CFs on the overall mechanical properties are investigated.

However, the Li2S full cell suffers from rapid capacity degradation due to the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. Herein, a Li2S/Si full cell is designed with a Li2S cathode incorporated by titanium nitride (TiN) polysulfide immobilizer within parallel hollow carbon (PHC). This full cell delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(Li2S)(-1) (1007 mAh g(sulfur)(-1)) at 0.5 C rate and excellent cyclability with only 0.4% capacity fade per cycle over 200 cycles. The long cycle stability is ascribed to the strong polysulfide anchor effect of TiN and highly efficient electron/ion transport within the interconnected weblike architecture of PHC. Theoretical calculations, self-discharge measurements, and anode stability experiments further confirm the strong adsorption of polysulfides on the TiN surface. The present work demonstrates that the flexible Li2S cathode and paired Si anode can be used to achieve highly efficient Li-S full cells.

It is believed that the chemical bond of C-S is responsible for the superior electrochemical properties in Li-S battery, that is, the strong interaction between S and carbon matrix significantly improves the conductivity of S, effectively buffers the structural strain/stress caused by the large volume change during lithiation/delithiation, completely eliminates the formation of high-order polysulfide intermediates, and substantially avoids the shuttle reaction and the side reaction between polysulfide anions and carbonate solvent, and thus enables the C/S cathode to use conventional carbonate-based electrolytes and achieve outstanding electrochemical properties in Li-S battery. The results may substantially contribute to the progress of the Li-S battery technology.

Nevertheless, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and resulting self-discharge lead to capacity fade loss and poor electrochemical performance. Herein, graphitic-carbon nitride/carbon nanotubes (g-C3N4/CNTs) hybrid membrane is fabricated by the flow-direct vacuum filtration process. The as-prepared 3-D freestanding g-C3N4/CNTs membrane employed as positive current collector containing Li2S6 catholyte solution for lithium/polysulfides batteries. The fabricated g-C3N4/CNTs provide a physical barriers and chemisorption resist polysulfide shuttling. Moreover, the conductive network constructed by CNTs can empower sulfur to be evenly distributed in the cathode and accelerates electron transport. Thus, to further prove the cooperative effect of g-C3N4 and CNTs, the freestanding g-C3N4/CNTs/Li2S6 electrode exhibits more stable electrochemical performance than CNTs/Li2S6 electrode, deliver the first discharge capacity of 876 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and maintained at 633 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles. The sulfur mass in electrode was increased to 7.11 mg, and the g-C3N4/CNTs/Li2S6 electrode also possess a high capacity retention of 75.5%. Meanwhile, g-C3N4 modified CNTs can not only trap polysulfides by strong adsorption but also effectively inhibit the self-discharge behavior of lithium/polysulfides batteries. As a consequence, the g-C3N4/CNTs composites for lithium/polysulfides batteries are indicating an excellent electrochemical stability with a long-term storage without obvious capacity degradation.

An electrodepostion method was applied to prepare the cathode at room temperature and the sulfur mass was controllable from 0.21 to 4.79 mg/cm(2) in a large area of over 100 cm(2). The optimized cathode with 0.45 mg/cm(2) S on Ni foam displayed high initial discharge capacity (1458 mAh/g at 0.1 C), high rate capability (521 mAh/g at 10 C), and long cycling stability (895 mAh/g after 300 cycles at 0.5 C and 528 mAh/g after 1400 cycles at 5 C). Moreover, in situ Raman and transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated the fundamentals of reversible electrochemical reaction between S and Li2S nanodots. This fast, facile, and one-step cathode preparation method with excellent electrochemical performance will lead to technological advances of S cathode in Li-S batteries.

Surface area analysis, elemental mapping, and transmission electron micrographs revealed that the spray-precipitated sulfur particles feature 11 times higher surface area compared to conventional precipitated sulfur, with homogeneous distribution in the carbon. Moreover, the scanning electron micrographs show that these high-surface-area sulfur particles are firmly adhered to and covered by carbon. This precipitated S-C composite exhibits high discharge capacity with about 75% capacity retention. The initial discharge capacity was further improved to 1444mAhg(-1) by inserting a free-standing single-walled carbon nanotube layer in between the cathode and the separator. Moreover, with the help of the fixed capacity charging technique, 91.6% capacity retention was achieved.

Herein, the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) of a nanostructured silicon/carbon anode after long-term cycling in an ether-based electrolyte for Li-S batteries is investigated. The role of LiNO3 and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) in dimethoxy ethane (DME) solutions as typically used electrolyte components on the electrochemical performance and interfacial characteristics on silicon are evaluated. Because of the high surface area of our nanostructured electrode owing to the silicon particle size of around 5 nmand the porous carbon scaffold, the interfacial characteristics dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility opening a detailed analysis. We show that the use of DME/DOL solutions under ambient temperature causes higher degradation of electrolyte components compared to carbonate-based electrolytes used for Li-ion batteries (LIB). This behavior of DME/DOL mixtures is associated with different SEI component formation and it is demonstrated that LiNO3 addition can significantly stabilize the cycle performance of nanostructured silicon/carbon anodes. A careful post-mortem analysis and a discussion in context to carbonate-based electrolyte solutions helps to understand the degradation mechanism of silicon-based anodes in rechargeable lithium-based batteries.

However, the Li2S full cell suffers from rapid capacity degradation due to the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. Herein, a Li2S/Si full cell is designed with a Li2S cathode incorporated by titanium nitride (TiN) polysulfide immobilizer within parallel hollow carbon (PHC). This full cell delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 702 mAh g(Li2S)(-1) (1007 mAh g(sulfur)(-1)) at 0.5 C rate and excellent cyclability with only 0.4% capacity fade per cycle over 200 cycles. The long cycle stability is ascribed to the strong polysulfide anchor effect of TiN and highly efficient electron/ion transport within the interconnected web-like architecture of PHC. Theoretical calculations, self-discharge measurements, and anode stability experiments further confirm the strong adsorption of polysulfides on the TiN surface. The present work demonstrates that the flexible Li2S cathode and paired Si anode can be used to achieve highly efficient Li-S full cells.

The material exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with high capacity and good cycling stability (757 mA h g(-1) after 150 cycles at 200 mA g(-1)). The likely contributing factors to the outstanding charge/discharge performance of Gr-SnO2-C could be related to the synergism between the excellent conductivity and large area of graphene, the nanosized particles of SnO2, and the effects of the coating layer of carbon, which could alleviate the effects of volume changes, keep the structure stable, and increase the conductivity. This work suggests a strategy to prepare carbon-coated graphene-metal oxide which could be used to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium ion batteries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here an effective polysulfide immobilizer and catalytic promoter is developed by proposing oxygen-vacancy-rich TinO2n-1 quantum dots (OV-T(n)QDs) decorated on porous carbon nanosheets (PCN), which are modulated using Ti3C2Tx MXene as starting materials. The T(n)QDs not only confine polysulfides through strong chemisorption but also promote polysulfide conversion via redox-active catalysis. The introduction of oxygen vacancies further boosts the immobilization and conversion of polysulfides by lowering the adsorption energy and shortening the bond lengths. The PCN provides a physical polysulfide confinement as well as a flexible substrate preventing OV-T(n)QDs from aggregation. Moreover, the two building blocks are conductive, thereby effectively improving the electron/charge transfer. Finally, the ultrasmall size of QDs along with the porous structure endows OV-T(n)QDs@PCN with large specific surface area and pore volume, affording adequate space for S loading and volume expansion. Therefore, the OV-T(n)QDs@PCN/S delivers a high S loading (79.1 wt%), good rate capability (672 mA h g(-1) at 2 C), and excellent long-term cyclability (88% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 2 C). It also exhibits good Li+ storage under high S-mass loading and lean electrolyte.

In this study, yolk-shell structured carbon microspheres are prepared by spray pyrolysis, and their formation mechanism is investigated. SnO2/carbon-carbon core-shell microspheres, prepared by one-step spray pyrolysis using a solution containing tin(II) oxalate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and sucrose, are used as precursor microspheres; the shell and core are formed from PVP and sucrose, respectively. Carbon yolk-shell microspheres with a carbon-void-carbon configuration are prepared by the elimination of SnO2 using Se under a reducing atmosphere. The carbon yolk-shell microspheres prepared from the solution containing sucrose have more filled yolk than the microspheres prepared from the solution without sucrose. The first discharge and charge capacities of the sulfur infiltrated carbon yolk-shell microspheres with a filled yolk at a current density of 0.1 A g (-1) are 1503 and 1368 mA h g (-1), respectively. The discharge capacity of the microspheres after the 150th cycle at a current density of 0.5 A g (-1) is 602 mA h g (- 1). The microspheres have high reversible discharge capacities of 817, 735, 626, 513, and 340 mA h g (-1) at the current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 10 A g (-1), respectively. The sulfur-infiltrated carbon yolkshell microspheres with the filled yolk show superior rate performance compared to the hollow microspheres with negligible yolk.

An energy-dense, flowable suspension of hollow carbon nanoshell-hosted sulfur as an electroactive material for flow batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Semi-solid flow battery; Lithium-sulfur battery; Hollow carbon nanoshell; Viscosity; Energy storage	PUMPED HYDRO STORAGE; WIND POWER; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; PRESSURE; PROGRESS; SOLAR	We demonstrate an energy-dense, flowable electroactive material by suspending solid sulfur hosted in hollow carbon nanoshells (HCSs) in a liquid electrolyte without extra conductive additives for the pursuit of high-energy-density semi-solid flow batteries. Compared to conventionally used Ketjen Black (KB) additives, the conductive HCSs can confine the insulating active materials within their void space, while maintaining the electroactivity of the outer surface. More importantly, the liquid suspension of well-dispersed HCS/S nanoparticles shows much lower viscosity than that formed by aggregated KB particles with a hyperbranched structure. The cell with the liquid suspension paired with Li metal achieves an average volumetric capacity of similar to 80 Ah L-1 over 50 stable cycles in the static test and an energy density of 230 Wh L-1 in the intermittent flow test. Our energy-dense HCS/S suspension with high flowability shows great potential for high-energy-density energy storage systems.	[Zhang, Leicheng; Zhao, Chen; Wu, Maochun; Zhao, T.

To solve this problem, we proposed a new strategy to suppress the dissolution of the polysulfide intermediates and the agglomeration of the discharge products through surface-modification of the sulfur electrode by in-situ electropolymerized poly(N-methylpyrrole) (PNMP). The PNMP-modified sulfur electrode exhibits stable surface morphology during charge and discharge, effectively depressing the structural collapse of the sulfur electrode. The charge-discharge measurements reveal that the PNMP-modified S/C electrode can deliver the same high reversible capacity as the bare electrode but demonstrate a much improved cycling stability with excellent capacity retention of 78.1% over 200 cycles with respect to the discharge capacity in the third cycle, considerably higher than that of the bare electrode (59.8%). In addition, this surface modification method is simple and affordable, providing a feasible way for improving the long-term cycleability of Li-S batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This nanostructured membrane is used as a self-supporting cathode without metal current-collectors for Li-S batteries. The membrane cathode has a high electrical conductivity and renders a long life of sulphur of over 100 charge-discharge cycles. High discharge capacity of sulphur was attained at 712 mA h g(sulphur)(-1) (23 wt% S) and 520 mA h g(sulphur)(-1) (50 wt% S) at a high current density (6 A g(sulphur)(-1)). The overall capacity of the flexible cathode correspondingly reaches 163 mA h g(-1) (23 wt% S) and 260 mA h g(-1) (50 wt% S). These results demonstrate the great potential of this nanostructured flexible membrane as a cathode for Li-S batteries with fast charge-discharge performance and long life.

The acceleration of the polysulfide conversion reaction to their end products via electrocatalysis has the appeal of a root-cause solution. However, the polysulfide electrocatalysts developed to date have rarely considered polysulfide conversion as a multistep reaction and, as such, were not optimized to target specific steps in the overall S-8 <-> Li2Sn <-> Li2S conversion. The targeting approach is however beneficial, as to design multicatalyst systems to reduce as many rate-limiting steps in the overall catalysis as effectively possible. This article demonstrates the concept and implementation of stepwise electrocatalysis in polysulfide conversion, using Fe-N and Co-N co-doped carbons to selectively catalyze the long-chain polysulfide conversion (S-8 <-> Li2S4) and the short-chain polysulfide conversion reactions (Li2S4 <-> Li2S), respectively. The two electrocatalysts were deployed in the sulfur cathode as a dual layer, using an ordered spatial separation to synergize their catalytic effects. A sulfur electrode designed as such could utilize similar to 90% of the sulfur theoretical specific capacity and support a high areal capacity of similar to 8.3 mAh cm(-2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 mu L mg(-1).

The poly(S-co-DVB) cathode offers scalability owing to the abundance and low cost of DVB. The Li-HC anode, the surface of which is passivated by a solid electrolyte interphase, inhibits the deposition of polysulfides. As a result, the LISB exhibits reversible and stable cycling performance at high rates up to 3 C, which enables quick charging within 20 min, and delivers a reversible capacity of approximately 400 mA hg(-1) at 3 C for 500 cycles. The results give insight into the design principle of promising, quickly charged, and safe LISBs.

The polysulfide shuttle becomes severe particularly when the areal loading of the active material (sulfur) is increased to deliver the high energy density and the charge/discharge current density is raised to deliver high power. This study reports a novel mechanochemical method to create trenches on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in free-standing 3D porous CNT sponges. Unique spiral trenches are created by pressures during the chemical treatment process, providing polysulfide-philic surfaces for cathode and lithiophilic surfaces for anode. The Li-S cells made from manufacturing-friendly sulfur-sandwiched cathodes and lithium-infused anodes using the mechanochemically treated electrodes exhibit a strikingly high areal capacity as high as 13.3 mAh cm(-2), which is only marginally reduced even with a tenfold increase in current density (16 mA cm(-2)), demonstrating both high cell-level energy density and power. The outstanding performance can be attributed to the significantly improved reaction kinetics and lowered overpotentials coming from the reduced interfacial resistance and charge transfer resistance at both cathodes and anodes. The trench-wall CNT sponge simultaneously tackles the most critical problems on both the cathodes and anodes of Li-S batteries, and this method can be utilized in designing new electrode materials for energy storage and beyond.

Herein, a porous MoN@nitrogen-doped carbon (MoN-NC) nano-octahedron with a bicontinuous intertwined MoN and NC porous structure was designed as a novel S host material for Li-S batteries. With hierarchical pore structures, the NC immobilized the LiPSs by physical-chemical confinement. Moreover, the continuous MoN framework demonstrated excellent chemisorption with LiPSs as well as the electrocatalysis of the LiPS redox reactions, which was confirmed by our experimental and theoretical results. Due to the synergetic effect of the NC and MoN, the S/MoN-NC cathode with a high S content up to 77% exhibited greatly enhanced electrochemical performances. At 0.5C, the S/MoN-NC cathode delivered a long life of 895 mA h g(-1) after 350 cycles, which was much higher than that of its S/MoN and S/NC counterparts (71% and 49% after 100 cycles, respectively). At a high current density of 2C, the specific capacity of S/MoN-NC was 3.2 and 1.3 times higher than that of its S/MoN and S/NC counterparts, respectively. Remarkably, with the increase in the S loading up to 6.5 mg cm(-2), the high capacity retention was still maintained (0.059% capacity decay over 200 cycles). This study gives useful guidance to enable high-energy and high-power Li-S batteries for practical applications.

However, current graphitic carbons are limited by low conductivity, low surface area, and ineffective pore structure. Here we report a scalable synthesis of porous graphitic carbons using a conjugated polymeric molecular framework as precursor. The multivalent cross-linker and rigid conjugated framework help to maintain micro-and mesoporous structures, while promoting graphitization during carbonization and chemical activation. The above unique design results in a class of highly graphitic carbons at temperature as low as 800 degrees C with record-high surface area (4073 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (2.26 cm(-3)), and hierarchical pore architecture. Such carbons simultaneously exhibit electrical conductivity >3 times more than activated carbons, very high electrochemical activity at high mass loading, and high stability, as demonstrated by supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur batteries with excellent performance. Moreover, the synthesis can be readily tuned to make a broad range of graphitic carbons with desired structures and compositions for many applications.	[To, John W.

Herein, a 3D hierarchical structure composed of NiMoO4 nanosheets in situ anchored on N-S doped carbon clothes (NiMoO4@NSCC) as the free-standing host is creatively designed and constructed for Li-S battery. Dual transitional metal oxide (NiMoO4) increases the electrons density near the Fermi level due to the contribution of the incorporating molybdenum (Mo), leading to the smaller bandgap, and thus stronger metallic properties compared with NiO. Furthermore, as a bidirectional catalyst, NiMoO4 is proposed to facilitate reductions of polysulfides through lengthening the S-S bond distance of Li2S4 and reducing the free energy of polysulfides conversion, meanwhile promote critical oxidation of insulative discharge product (Li2S) via lengthening Li-S bond distance of Li2S and decreasing Li2S decomposition barrier. Therefore, after loading sulfur (2 mg cm(-2)), NiMoO4@NSCC/S as the self-supporting cathode for the Li-S battery exhibits impressive long cycle stability. This study proposes a concept of a bidirectional catalyst with dual metal oxides, which would supply a novel vision to construct the high-performance Li-S battery.

Due to the synergy of TBAC and ZIF-8, the prepared ZIF-8@TBAC-PVDF (ZIF@T-PVDF) nanofibers were yielded spiderweb-like structure with gel fibers, small pore size, high porosity and uniformly exposed nanoparticles on the surface, thus improving the absorption capacity of the liquid electrolyte. In particular, the uniform distribution of lithium ions above the lithium anode with the limitation of the spiderweb-like structure facilitates uniform lithium deposition and reduces the generation of lithium dendrites. Moreover, the LSBs with ZIF@T-PVDF membranes exhibited high first-cycle discharge capacity of 1324.2 mAh g(-1) with extended cycling stability of 0.05% per cycle and Coulombic efficiency of 97% after the 700 cycles at 2 C. The excellent electrochemical and safety properties are attributed to the fact that the gel-like membrane material can not only physically block and chemically adsorb lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also greatly inhibit the growth of dendrites. Therefore, the spiderweb-like ZIF@T-PVDF separator can be identified as a dependable candidate for the advanced LSBs. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

After mixed with oil-based poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) and water-based polyacrylic latex (LA133), SNP/PVDF, S@PEPS/PVDF, SNP/LA, S@PEPS/LA cathodes with different interfacial properties are fabricated. The electrochemical results indicate that the S@PEPS based cathodes possess much better cycling stability than SNP based cathodes due to the conductivity and blocking effect of PEDOT: PSS shell. The S@PEPS/PVDF cathode exhibits much better cycling performance and rate property than that of S@PEPS/LA. The fitting data of EIS indicate that S@PEPS/PVDF cathode possesses smaller charge-transfer resistance and faster Li+ diffusion rate than S@PEPS/LA cathode. It can be proved that (1) the attraction between H+/Na+ in PEDOT: PSS and electronegative groups in PVP (C=O and N) and PVDF (F atom) help to maintain the stability of the cathode, enhance the electrochemical kinetics and suppress the dissolution of lithium polysulfide; (2) The outer PVDF binder glues KB on the surface of S@PEPS to form porous interfaces and benefit the e(-)/Li+ transmission. In brief, the electrode/electrolyte interfacial property built with S@PEPS and PVDF fulfill the synergistic effect of all the interfacial components and improve the electrochemical performance of S@PEPS/PVDF cathode.

However, there is still insufficient evidence for a key factor to achieve their high electrochemical performance. Here, the effects of nanopores and sulfur doping on carbon-based nanoporous host (CNH) electrode materials for LMAs were investigated using natural polymer-derived CNHs. Homogeneous pore-filling behaviors of lithium metal in the nanopores of the CNH electrode materials were first observed by ex situ scanning electron microscopy analysis, where the protective lithium metal nucleation and growth process led to significantly high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of similar to 99.4% and stable 600 cycles. In addition, a comparison study of CNH and sulfur-doped CNH (S-CNH) electrodes, which differ only in the presence or absence of sulfur, revealed that sulfur doping can cause lower electrochemical series resistance, higher CE value, and better cycling stability in a wide range of current densities and number of cycles. Moreover, S-CNH-based LMAs showed high electrochemical performance in full-cell Li-S battery tests using a sulfur copolymer cathode, where a high energy density of 1370 W h kg(electrode)(-1) and an excellent power density of 4120 W kg(electrode)(-1) were obtained.

The electro-polymerized PPy thin film shows sufficiently good mechanical properties to be included in a self-supporting free-standing layered cathode. Physical and morphological characterizations show that this PPy film is flexible, robust, lightweight, corrugated, and highly conductive. These properties facilitate the use of PPy thin film in a self supported flexible electrode composed of slurry-free PPy-sulfur-PPy sandwiched structure. Because the conventional slurry casting method could be avoided, a large amount of active material could be loaded in between the corrugated PPy films. The newly developed flexible PPy-sulfur-PPy sandwiched electrode thus show high capacity when coupled with lithium, along with good cycling performance and excellent capacity retention.

One of the possible solutions is to design proper cathode electrocatalysts to accelerate the redox interconversion of solvated polysulfide intermediates. Herein, we report cobalt atoms dispersed on hierarchical carbon nitride support as an effective cathode electrocatalyst for lithium-polysulfide batteries. The electrocatalyst material is prepared from the simple reaction between melamine and cyanuric acid in the presence of Co2+, followed by the Ar annealing. The product has a unique hierarchical structure consisting of many thin and porous C3N4 nanosheets finely dispersed with Co atoms. The atomic dispersion of Co species is confirmed by X-ray absorption experiments. Electrochemical measurements reveal that it can promote the interconversion of polysulfides. As a result, batteries using this cathode electrocatalyst achieve large capacity (similar to 1400 mAh/g at 1.6 mA/cm(2)), good rate performance (similar to 800 mAh/g at 12.8 mA/cm(2)) and impressive cycling stability under different current densities and different sulfur loadings.

However, most 3D-CFs acquired by the previously reported fabrication methods have some limitations, such as uncontrollable morphology, plenty of inherent defects, difficult to realize self-standing after removing sacrificial template, and overlapping joint flaws among graphene layers. Although significant research efforts have been devoted to develop 3D foam, it is still a challenging task to obtain 3D-CF with both high conductivity and outstanding mechanical performance, simultaneously. To address this issue, a novel and easy fabricating approach for 3D ultrathin-graphite carbon foam (3D-UGF) was explored by a morphology-retaining pyrolysis of polyaniline foam precursors. The typical 3D-UGF graphitized at 2800 degrees C exhibited stronger compressive strength and electrical conductivity under the compressive strain of 90%, and remained constant even after 2000 cycles, which are comparable to the previously reported state-of-the-art 3D-CF foam with the same density. Cycling performance of the lithium-sulfur and lithium-air batteries with the 3D-UGF as binder-free cathode is as high as 1590 mAh g(-1) and 920 mAh g(-1) after deep discharge/charge 100 cycles, respectively.

To overcome this problem, the electrode materials must be able to capture polysulfides. In this theoretical work, we explored the polysulfide fixation properties of N-substituted defective graphene by performing density functional theory calculations. From an analysis of the numerical results, including the structural configurations and charge redistribution of lithium-sulfides and the binding energies, charge density differences and density of Li2Sn on graphene-based materials, we explained the mechanism of the dissolution and diffusion of Li2Sn as well as its immobilization properties on N-substituted defective graphene.

However, such strong chemical interaction against polysulfides was not observed by CeO2 nanocubes with preferentially exposed (100) crystal planes and CeO2 nanoctahedra with preferentially exposed (1 1 1) crystal planes. In addition to the factor of the exposed crystal planes, CeO2 nanorods possess defect-rich surfaces (i.e., oxygen vacancies and Ce3+) also serving as possible polysulfides anchoring sites, which can contribute to effective immobilization of lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from the above-mentioned advantages, CeO2 nanorods are considered as an outstanding candidate of cathode host materials for long life and high-performance Li-S batteries.

This composite makes full use of the protection of the carbon layer on the surface, the good conductivity and three-dimensional (3D) structure of rGO, the mesoporous structure and nanoscale size of Co9S8, thereby presenting the excellent electrochemical performances in potassium-ion batteries, 407.9 mAh center dot g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 A center dot g(-1) and 215.1 mAh center dot g(-1) at 5 A center dot g(-1) in rate performances. After 1,200 cycles at 1.0 A center dot g(-1), this composite still remains a capacity of 210.8 mAh center dot g(-1). The redox reactions for potassium storage are revealed by ex-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM)/high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. The application of this composite as the host of sulfur for Li-S batteries is also explored. It sustains a capacity of 431.8 mAh center dot g(-1) after 800 cycles at 3 C, leading to a degradation of 0.052% per cycle. These results confirm the wide applications of this composite for electrochemical energy storage.

Generally, the sulfur content and sulfur mass loading of sulfur electrodes along with the electrolyte/sulfur ratio are the crucial factors in achieving high-energy-density Li-S batteries. Here, we construct a micro-nano-structured CS@CTAB/ABS + CNTS electrode with a high sulfur content of 76 wt% and a high sulfur mass loading of 6.7-11.1 mg cm(-2) for application in Li-S batteries via the blade-casting technique. Benefiting from the unique sulfur composite design, the thick sulfur electrodes demonstrated low polarization, high sulfur utilization and promising electrochemical stability. A high areal capacity of 6.0 mA h cm(-2) over 50 cycles was achieved with a sulfur mass loading of 6.7 mg cm(-2). And a higher areal capacity of 7.14 mA h cm(-2) over 46 cycles could be achieved when the mass loading was increased to 8.9 mg cm(-2). Even with a high sulfur mass loading of 11.1 mg cm(-2), the sulfur electrode can still deliver a high areal capacity of 11.22 mA h cm(-2) at a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (4 : 1, mu l : mg). Hence, this kind of sulfur composite would put forward the possibility of the practical utilization of high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

Defect engineering as an advanced functional strategy has been confirmed to have the competent capability of optimizing the electrocatalytic kinetics. In this work, the conventional phosphorization process is used to process Co3O4 anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. Unexpectedly, there is no phase change, only phosphorus doping with rich lattice dislocation on Co3O4. With the combined characterization of X-ray diffraction, highresolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is found that phosphorus doping transfers part of the oxygen vacancies to the lattice oxygen of Co3O4, which can induce the catalytic active species Co-O-P. The concomitant lattice dislocations can strengthen the chemical adsorption of phosphorus-doped Co3O4 for polysulfides and even elevate more catalytically active sites. With the use of defect-rich phosphorus-doped Co3O4 embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (P-Co3O4/NCNT) as an electrocatalyst, Li-S batteries showcase enhanced oxidation and reduction kinetics and an improved rate performance. This work provides new insight into the rational design of the electrocatalyst of heteroatom-doped metal compounds for high-performance Li-S batteries.

J	Di Salvo, JL; Luque, GL; De Luca, G				Luque Di Salvo, Javier; Luque, Guillermina L.; De Luca, Giorgio			Lithium polysulfide conformer analysis in ether-based solvents for Li-S batteries	MOLECULAR SYSTEMS DESIGN & ENGINEERING			English	Article							SULFUR BATTERIES; ELECTROLYTE; SPECIATION; DYNAMICS; GRAPHENE; SHUTTLE; DISSOLUTION; STABILITY; KINETICS; CATHODES	A fundamental understanding of polysulfide conformers in common (ether-based) solvents used in prototype lithium-sulfur batteries is mandatory to push the technology towards practical applications. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations were used to perform a detailed conformational analysis and dynamics ascertainment of lithium hexasulfide Li2S6 as a representative of soluble long-chain lithium polysulfides. This novel conformational dynamics study based on 10(6) structures per studied system provides important insights into open questions such as how many Li+ coordinate polysulfides are correlated to lithium transport and polysulfide clustering. The simulations predict that monoanionic LiS6- in its closed conformation is the predominant structure in 1,2-dioxolane and dimethoxyethane equimolar mixtures. If a second Li+ approaches, that leads to the opening of the polysulfide chain and the formation of neutral Li2S6 (open conformer). By changing the electrolyte composition, the relative distribution of closed and open conformers varies, although closed LiS6- remains the most abundant conformer compared to the open one. There are three major findings from this work: the first is that there is a greater abundance of the closed conformer, in which the closed/open aspect ratio depends on electrolyte composition; the second is that the polysulfide charge distribution resulting from the nearby coordinating lithium cations was determined; and the third is that the number and type of solvent molecules coordinating the lithium polysulfide were determined. These findings, which have been missing up to now to the best of our knowledge, provide crucial information for the design of strategies to suppress the unwanted polysulfide shuttle effect, such as engineered separators and cathode protective layers.

The conventional strategy to tackle this issue is to design host materials for trapping polysulfides via weak physical confinement and interfacial chemical interactions. Even though beneficial, their capability for the polysulfide immobilization is still limited. Herein, the unique sulfiphilic nature of metallic Cu is revisited. Upon the exposure to polysulfide in aqueous or aprotic solution, the surface sulfidization rapidly takes place, resulting in the formation of Cu2S nanoflake arrays with tunable texture. When the sulfidized Cu current collector is directly used as the sulfur-equivalent cathode, it enables high-performance Li/Na-S batteries at room temperature with reasonable high sulfur loading. Specific capacities up to approximate to 1200 mAh g(-1) for Li-S and approximate to 400 mAh g(-1) for Na-S are measured when normalized to the amount of equivalent sulfur, and can be readily sustained for >1000 cycles.

However, the Li-S system has yet to conquer the market owing to its drawbacks such as soluble polysulfide formation. To tackle this issue, we report herein a strategy based on the use of a micro-porous copper metal-organic framework named CuMOF as a host material for sulfur immobilization via chemical bonds between sulfur and the MOF structure. CuMOF has been obtained by simple chemical synthesis using copper salt and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid as the ligand. Then, by the melt-diffusion method, sulfur-impregnated CuMOFS material is finally fabricated. As a cathode material for Li-S batteries, the CuMOFS cathode delivers a capacity of 1051.3 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at a charge/discharge current density of 200 mA g(-1). It is worth noting that the main cathode structure can retain more than 19.3 wt% sulfur due to the CuMOF host, which dramatically decreases capacity fading and improves coulombic efficiency during prolonged charge/discharge cycling. The XPS peaks of CuMOFS are assigned according to the information obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Linear scaling DFT structure relaxation for a model with >1000 atoms is carried out to exemplify the interactions between CuMOF framework and embedded Li2S. The excellent electrochemical performance can be due to firm confinement of sulfur/polysulfides because of strong chemical interactions between carbon and sulfur species in the CuMOF host.

Polysulfide solution effects on LiS batteries performances	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium sulfur battery; Polysulfide solutions; Hybrid semi-flow batteries	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; CATHODE MATERIALS; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; MEMBRANE; LINO3	Recently, rechargeable US batteries, a next-generation energy storage system, are deeply studied due to their theoretical specific energy density. However, to produce batteries comparable to those already available on the market some drawbacks must be overcome, including essentially self-discharge, high internal resistance and rapid capacity fading upon cycling. In this work the use of polysulfide solutions either as additives or as active material in LiS batteries is proposed. The addition of polysulfides to the electrolytic solution improves the cell performances in terms of specific capacity and coulombic efficiency, passing from a capacity of about 150 mAh/g with a coulombic efficiency of about 0.85 to a capacity of 600 mAh/g with a coulombic efficiency of about 0.99 after 10 cycles. In batteries where polysulfide solutions are used as cathodic material, the obtained performances are even higher, reaching specific capacities of 420-450 mAh/g after about 70 cycles. Moreover, the cells tested with carbon paper as electrode support shows a greater reversibility, with a coulombic efficiency very close to 1. Finally, reducing the potential window from 3 to 1.5 V to 2.8-1.7 V, the cells show high stability and efficiency, reaching specific capacity values of about 600 mAh/g after 200 cycles.

However, rapid capacity fading and poor rate capability under higher loading hinder its practical applications. Despite the encouraging progress achieved, the cost-effective solutions are still need to be sought for. Herein, a flower-like nitrogen-oxygen-doped carbon coated sulfur (F-S@NOC) composite was synthesized from a low-cost sulfur-containing organic ferro-compound, through a facile calcination and an in-situ oxidation process. The unique flower configuration is constructed by two-dimensional flake petal unit that not only expose more polar nitrogen/oxygen-containing functional groups for anchoring the dissolved intermediates of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also facilitate improved electrochemical reaction kinetics since fast electron/Li+ transfer. Therefore, F-S@NOC demonstrates excellent electrochemical performances that a decay rate of 0.05% per cycle at 1C, and a high initial areal capacity of 4.49 mAh cm(-2) at 0.2C, are obtained respectively under the sulfur loading of 3 and 4.6 mg cm(-2).

However, the sulfur loading, low active material utilization, and poor cycling stability limit their commercial applications. Herein, we prepared a three-dimensional structure of polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM)-functionalized nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (PAMAM@N-CNFs) by combined electrospun and solution coating techniques. The fabrication of freestanding PAMAM@N-CNF membranes was carried out using a Li2S6 catholyte for lithium-polysulfides batteries. The PAMAM@N-CNFs shows the strong physicochemical adsorption of polysulfides and effectively reduced the electrochemical polarization. The Li2S6 catholyte-impregnated PAMAM@N-CNF electrode (sulfur loading: 4.74 mg) shows a high first discharge capacity of 998 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and stabilizes at 783 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles, exhibiting a superior cycling performance than the N-CNFs/Li2S6 electrode. In addition, an excellent initial capacity of 5.77 mA h (capacity retention of 71.2% over 400 cycles at 0.2 C) is achieved under a high sulfur loading of 7.11 mg. The N-CNFs modified by PAMAM with functional groups is promising for assembling with a high sulfur loading electrode, which exhibits a superior electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries.

Herein, we prepare a highly graphitized and Fe/N enriched carbon tube (Fe/N-g-CT) as multifunctional host. It is found that the introduction of Fe can efficaciously promote the transformation from amorphous carbon sheets to graphitized carbon tubes (CT), while the residual Fe species embedded in CT can act as catalytic active sites along with the doped heteroatoms. Specifically, Fe sites can accelerate the inter-conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides, while the doped-N heteroatoms can promote the deposition of Li2S. Consequently, Fe/N-g-CT catalytic mediums synchronously improve the conductivity and reaction kinetics of sulfur electrodes, and Fe/N-g-CT/S cathode exhibits a high initial specific capacity (1500.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and a low fading rate (0.06% per cycle at 2 C over 500 cycles). Moreover, even with high sulfur loading (4.5 mg cm(-2)) and lean electrolyte consumption (E/ S = 5 mL mg(-1)), a satisfactory areal capacity of 5.1 mAh cm(-2) can also be achieved. This paper raises a good strategy or idea to boost the development and commercialization application of Li-S battery with high performance through reasonably constructing sulfur host with high conductivity and catalysis activity.

Adsorption and diffusion of Li with S on pristine and defected graphene	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; CYCLE PERFORMANCE; CATHODE MATERIALS; STABILITY; ANODE	Li-S batteries are the promising high energy density alternative to current rechargeable battery technologies, particularly since it has been shown that the use of graphene, nanotubes and other nanostructured carbons in the cathode can improve the cyclability. We explore the microscopic interactions between LinS and graphene and diffusion of Li ions through pristine and defected graphene in the presence of S using first-principles methods. The introduction of Li weakens the interaction of atomic S with graphene, increasing the height of adsorbed S and leading to the formation of LinS clusters. These LinS clusters are adsorbed accompanied by charge transfer to the graphene. We find that double vacancies in the graphene are sufficient to allow Li ions to pass through the graphene plane. This is impeded in the presence of S due to the binding of Li to LinS clusters, but still can happen for larger clusters. The electronic properties confirm the excellent conductivity of pristine and defected graphene cathodes in contact with LinS clusters.	[Liang, Zhicong; Fan, Xiaofeng; Singh, David J.; Zheng, W.

The recent development of sulfur/mesoporous carbon nanocomposite cathodes represents a particularly exciting advance, but in full battery cells, sulfur-based cathodes have to be paired with metallic lithium anodes as the lithium source, which can result in serious safety issues. Here we report a novel lithium metal-free battery consisting of a Li2S/mesoporous carbon composite cathode and a silicon nanowire anode. This new battery yields a theoretical specific energy or 1550 Wh kg(-1), which is four times that of the theoretical specific energy of existing lithium-ion batteries based on LiCoO2 cathodes and graphite anodes (similar to 410 Wh kg(-1)). The nanostructured design of both electrodes assists in overcoming the issues associated with using sulfur compounds and silicon in lithium-ion batteries, including poor electrical conductivity, significant structural changes, and volume expansion. We have experimentally realized an initial discharge specific energy of 630 Wh kg(-1) based on the mass of the active electrode materials.

With this strategy, S nanodots and carbon nanocomposites (carbon nanotube (CNT) or reduced graphene oxide (RGO)) are directly deposited onto the Ni foams, which obviously increase the S loading and electron/ion conductivity of the whole electrodes.

Herein, we develop a method to prepare the suitable sulfur host materials for the lithium-sulfur batteries. The manganese dioxide nanospheres are successfully prepared and designed as sulfur host in the lithium-sulfur batteries. The as-prepared manganese dioxide/S composites could be formed flexible and self-supported electrode without the current collector.

However, the controllable synthesis of porous carbon with refined morphology is still a formidable challenge due to inevitable aggregation/fusion of resulted carbon particles during the high-temperature synthetic process. Herein, a hierarchically oriented carbon-structured (fiber-like) composite is fabricated by simultaneously taking advantage of a confined pyrolysis strategy and disparate bond environments within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In the resultant composite, the oriented carbon provides a fast mass (molecule/ion/electron) transfer efficiency; the doping-N atoms can anchor or act as active sites; the mesoporous SiO2(mSiO(2)) shell not only effectively prevents the derived carbon or active metal nanoparticles (NPs) from aggregation or leaching, but also acts as a "polysulfide reservoir" in the Li-S batteries to suppress the "shuttle" effect. Benefiting from these advantages, the synthesized composite Pd@NDHPC@mSiO(2)(NDHPC means N-doped hierarchically porous carbon) exhibits extremely high catalytic activity and stability toward the one-pot Knoevenagel condensation-hydrogenation reaction. Furthermore, the oriented NDHPC@mSiO(2)manifests a boosted capacity and cycling stability in Li-S batteries compared to the counterpart that directly pyrolyzes without silica protection. This report provides an effective strategy of fabricating hierarchically oriented carbon composites for catalysis and energy storage applications.

Cu has high electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and chemical stability. Li deposition on Cu coating with a porous structure disperses the local current density and produces a uniform Li-ion flux, greatly suppressing growth of Li dendrites and the layer prevents Li from directly contacting electrolyte while ensures Li-ion transport. The symmetric battery with the Cu-coated Li anode lasting for 140h presents stable Li deposition/dissolution and improved polarization. The full Li-S battery adopting this modified anode exhibits well-improved cycling stability and capacity retention. It delivers an initial discharge specific capacity of 1148mAh/g and obtains 526mAh/g after 300cycles with high Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 0.5 C (1 C=1675mAh/g), while the traditional Li-S battery only obtains 490mAh/g after 200cycles. Scanning electron microscopy images of the cycled Cu-coated Li anode presents favorable integrity. Electrochemical impedance spectra, cyclic voltammogram, and charge-discharge profiles were investigated to consolidate the function of the Cu coating. This simple and facile strategy provides an approach to protect the metal electrode applied in other metal batteries.

Reactive Li is prone to dendritic growth, causing short-circuits and aggravating electrolyte depletion. Here, lithiated silicon sulfur (SLS) full cells are realized by opting all-designs integrated strategy to rationally architecture the carbon matrices for both electrodes. For cathode, N/S- doped high surface area hierarchical porous carbons are designed to host sulfur and its redox species. Anodes are constructed by electrospinning using nano-silicon@void@carbon nanofibers (SVCNF) cross-linked with alginate-citric acid binder network. As-prepared anodes are reversibly alloyed and dealloyed with high reversible capacity of 2132 mAh g(Si)(-1) (427 mAh g(Si/CNF)(-1)) after 150 cycles at 716 mA g(Si)(-1) in ether-based electrolyte. At cathode, polypyrrole activated hierarchical carbon sulfur (PPyr_C/S) exhibits very stable performance with capacity retention around 767 mAh g(S)(-1) after 250 at C/5. After balancing with low Li excess, lithiated SVCNF anodes are coupled with PPyr_C/S cathodes, with initial capacity of 972 mAh g(S)(-1) and 50% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 225 mA g(S)(-1). Full SLS cells have been appreciated by opting rational architecture of carbon matrices in individual electrodes even at low lithium excess. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the structure evolution of porous graphene under high temperature is poorly understood. In this contribution, 3D double-layer templated graphene (DTG) composed of two non-stacked graphene layers with interlayer spacing around 15 nm and separated by a large quantity of protuberances, was employed as a special case to track the structure evolution of 3D porous graphene at high temperature. Compared with thermally reduced graphene oxide with easy graphitized nature, the unique non-stacked DTG structure was well preserved after a high-temperature annealing at 1600 degrees C. With limited self-healing of defects for graphene layers, and with preservation of mesosized protuberances that prevent graphene layers stacking during annealing, DTG is regarded as 'hard carbon' ('non-graphitizable carbon'). The electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, gravimetric elemental analysis, nitrogen/water physisorption, and probe reactions of electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction were employed to reveal the graphitization degree and surface chemistry of non-stacked DTG after high-temperature treatment.

However, dissolution and migration of lithium polysulfides (the 'shuttle effect') remain key obstacles for the practical development of lithium-sulfur cells. Here, we demonstrate that Fe1-xS (pyrrhotite) coated by N-doped carbon (Fe1-xS@NC) with high affinity for polysulfides and high electronic conductivity can be used as a functional additive to trap lithium polysulfides and reutilize reaction intermediates in the sulfur cathode during cycling. The addition of Fe1-xS@NC into the sulfur cathode results in the enhancement of cycling performance of the lithium-sulfur cell in terms of initial discharge capacity, capacity retention and rate capability. This superior cycling performance can be attributed to strong chemical interactions between electrically conductive Fe1-xS@NC particles and lithium polysulfides, which suppress the dissolution of lithium polysulfides and enhance the utilization of active sulfur during repeated cycling.

It is observed from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that the PAN nanoparticles, less than 100 nm in size, are anchored on the surface of the GNS and this unique structure is maintained in the sulfur composite cathode material. The electrochemical properties of the pyrolyzed PAN-S/GNS (pPAN-S/GNS) composite cathode have been evaluated by cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the pPAN-S/GNS nanocomposite, with a GNS content of ca. 4 wt.%, exhibits a reversible capacity of ca. 1500 mA hg(sulfur)(-1) or 700 mA hg(-1) composite in the first cycle, corresponding to a sulfur utilization of ca. 90%. The capacity retention is relatively stable at 0.1 C. Even up to 6 C, a competitive capacity of ca. 800 mA hg(sulfur)(-1) is obtained. The superior performance of pPAN-S/GNS is attributed to the introduction of the GNS and the even composite structure. The GNS in the composite materials works as a three-dimensional (3-D) nano current collector, which could act not only as an electronically conductive matrix, but also as a framework to improve the electrochemical performance.

Tungsten Disulfide Catalysts Supported on a Carbon Cloth Interlayer for High Performance Li-S Battery	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; LONG CYCLE LIFE; ELEMENTAL SULFUR; GRAPHENE OXIDE; HIGH-CAPACITY; CATHODE; NANOMATERIALS; SPECTROSCOPY; MEDIATOR; IMPROVE	The capacity limitations of insertion-compound cathodes has motivated interest in a sulfur cathode for a rechargeable battery cell with a metallic-lithium anode; but irreversible capacity loss owing to solubility of intermediate Li2Sx (x = 2-8) polysulfides in the organic-liquid electrolytes used has prevented practical application. A dual-function cathode structure consisting of layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) supported both on the cathode current collector and on a carbon cloth interlayer (CCl) gives excellent performance in a lithium half-cell by providing strong adsorption of the soluble Li2Sx on the WS2 with fast access to electrons from the current collector via a blocking carbon cloth interlayer.

In this work, selenium disulfide (SeS2) as an active ingredient is encapsulated into double-walled N-doped carbon (NC)@NiCo2S4 hollow capsules (NiCo2S4@NC) to obtain high-performance Li-SeS2 batteries. On the basis of ensuring excellent electrical conductivity, the hollow NiCo2S4 lining and its NC coating can not only suppress the shuttle effect of polyselenium/sulfide by the combined merits of chemical adsorption and physical constraint, but also are able to buffer the volume expansion of SeS2. Moreover, the polar NiCo2S4 is beneficial for enhancing the redox kinetics of lithium polyselenium/sulfide. As expected, the NiCo2S4@NC-SeS2 cathode delivers high reversible capacities of 1205.1 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and 673.5 mA h g(-1) at 2.0C. More importantly, the hybrid cell can show ultralong cycling life up to 800 cycles at 1.0C with the attenuation rate as low as 0.038% per cycle, which is superior to that of NiCo2S4-SeS2 and NC-SeS2 composites.

It is shown that the surface area, pore volume, and mesopore/micropore ratio of the as-prepared MPCs can be easily controlled by adjusting the ZnO/oil ratio. Sulfur/MPC (S/MPC) composite is prepared by blending sulfur powder with the as-prepared MPCs followed by microwave heating at three different powers (100 W/200 W/300 W) for 60 s. The unique micro/mesostructure characteristics of the resulting porous carbons not only endow the S/MPC composite with sufficient available space for sulfur storage, but also provide favorable and efficient channels for Li-ions/electrons transportation. When applied as the electrode material in a lithium-ion battery (LIB), the S/MPC composite shows a reversible capacity (about 500 mAh g(-1)) and a high columbic efficiency (>95%) after 70 cycles. Overall, the method proposed in this study provides a simple and green approach for the rapid production of MPCs and S/MPC composite for high-performance LIBs.

However, issues of rapid capacity decay and low coulombic efficiency hamper its practical application pace owing to polysulfides dissolution. Despite efforts on hybridizing sulfur with metal oxides to solve these issues are considered to be effective, the synthesis of hybrid materials is always tedious. Herein, S@MnO2 hybrid material was synthesized via a green method at room temperature. We encapsulate S spheres in poly-dopamine (PDA) by in-situ polymerization of dopamine. The formed PDA shell is served as reducing agent and sacrificial template to transform KMnO4 into delta-MnO2 shell without adding any other agents (such as acid). delta-MnO2 encapsulates the S spheres uniformly and succeeded in entrapping polysulfides when S@MnO2 used for Li-S battery, endowing the S@MnO2 cathode with high reversible capacity, improved cycling stability, and satisfied coulombic efficiency. Moreover, this method could be adopted for hybridizing d-MnO2 with diverse materials (such as CNTs@MnO2) in mild reaction environment (ambient pressure and temperature), exhibiting an extensive application on constructing Mn-based oxide hybrid functional materials.

The electrochemical properties of the resulting gel were investigated. This electrolyte was used in a lithium polymer cell with a nanostructured sulfur/ketjen black binary composite cathode prepared by wet ball-milling and heat-treatment. The gel polymer battery exhibited a high specific capacity of 753.8 mA h g(-1) at the initial cycle, stable reversible cycling and a capacity retention about 80% over 40 cycles along with a high coulombic efficiency, while the liquid electrolyte cell, in comparison, had low capacity retention and coulombic efficiency. The performance enhancement was attributed to the suppression of shuttle effect by the gel polymer electrolyte leading to higher sulfur utilization in the cell. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.

This has been accomplished by comparison of PVdF with the related copolymer, PVdF-HFP. Analysis of carbon black porosity after addition of binder in NMP solution reveals that PVdF(-HFP) fills pores of almost any size in carbon black, which can effect a severe reduction in pore volume and surface area accessible to the electrolyte in a LiS cell. Noting the different swelling behavior of both binders, the implications of pore filling by the binder on the electrochemistry of LiS cells can be determined. Because of the low swellability of PVdF in dimethoxyethane:dioxolane (DME:DOL)-based electrolytes, access of the electrolyte to the carbon surface area and pore volume is restricted, with potentially severe detrimental effects on the available capacity of the cell. Furthermore, this effect is still clearly significant for common binder loadings and with preinfiltration of sulfur; this study is therefore a clear demonstration that PVdF is an unsuitable choice of binder for the lithiumsulfur system and that alternatives must be considered.

Here we show that the electrochemical performance of the sulfur-carbon cathode can be easily adjusted by tuning the pore structure of the carbon substrate. With potassium hydroxide as the activation agent, a series of micro-/mesoporous carbon hosts have been prepared via chemical activation of hydrothermal carbon precursors. The pore structure of the carbon host can be easily controlled by adjusting the activation concentration of KOH, and is found to be directly related to the battery performance of sulfur loaded inside. An optimized pore structure is yielded at a KOH concentration of 1 M, at which the sulfur-carbon cathode shows a high specific capacity, favourable rate capabilities and a long cycle life of 800 cycles at 1 C. The impressive electrochemical performances benefit from the advanced micro-/mesoporous carbon spheres with a large percentage of micropores, moderate activation and surface area.

However, the weak interaction between soluble polysulfide and carbonaceous electrode is unable to restrict the soluble polysulfide shuttle effect, leading to the short cycling life. Herein, we innovatively design an asymmetric self-supporting hybrid sponge electrode whose one side is covered by deeply fluorinated carbon nanotubes (F-CNTs, F/C ratio of 0.88) with the appropriate thickness of similar to 0.5 mu m and the other side is kept bare as the current collector for the high-performance Li-polysulfide battery. The carbon nanotubes sponges (CSP) provides enough space for a high sulfur loading, three-dimensional net structure for fast ions diffusion and connective electrical conducive networks for electrons transfer. The F-CNTs layer shows a strong affinity to soluble polysulfide according to first-principles calculations, which restrains the diffusion of soluble polysulfide from CSP to anode and suppress the shuttle effect significantly. As a result, a high specific capacity of 1344 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, an excellent rate capability of 780.9 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and a great cycling stability for 400 cycles with similar to 0.11% capacity decay per cycle have been achieved at the sulfur loading of 2.55 mg cm(-2). Particularly, at a high sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2), the hybrid electrode even shows a reversible capacity of 868.9 mAh g -1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C.

However, the application of Li-S battery is limited by the low conductivity of sulfur and the diffusion of soluble intermediate polysulfide. To solve this issue, we have successfully prepared a graphite nanosheet/manganese dioxide (GN/MnO2) composite as the sulfur host material by a one-step electrochemical exfoliation-deposition method. Combined with the high electrical conductivity of GN and the strong interaction between MnO(2)and polysulfide, the derived GN/MnO2/S cathode could exhibit superior electrochemical performance and high stability during the charge-discharge process. Even after 250 cycles, the GN/MnO2/S composite remained a stable discharge capacity of 493.5 mAh/g with the capacity retention of 68.5%.

Ordered porous CMK-8 carbon was used as the host matrix and gradually filled with sulfur (20-50 wt %) via melt impregnation. Owing to the almost complete match between the electron densities of carbon and sulfur, the porous nanocomposites present in essence a two-phase system and the filling of the host material can be precisely followed by this method. The absolute scattering intensities normalized per unit of mass were corrected accounting for the scattering contribution of the turbostratic microstructure of carbon and amorphous sulfur. The analysis using the Porod parameter and the chord-length distribution (CLD) approach determined the specific surface areas and filling mechanism of the nanocomposite materials, respectively. Thus, SAXS provides comprehensive characterization of the sulfur distribution in porous carbon and valuable information for a deeper understanding of cathode materials of lithium sulfur batteries.

A facile synthetic approach to nanostructured Li2S cathodes for rechargeable solid-state Li-S batteries	NANOSCALE			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR; GRAPHENE OXIDE; NANOCOMPOSITE; NANOCRYSTALS; COMPOSITE; PAPER	Li-S solid state batteries, employing Li2S as a pre-lithiated cathode, present a promising low cost, high capacity and safer alternative to their liquid electrolyte counterparts, where dissolution of intermediate polysulfide species can result in loss of active material and a subsequent decrease in ionic conductivity. A nanostructured Li2S material would afford greater flexibility in optimising the cathode composite for more harmonious electrode-electrolyte interactions, yet facile routes to such nanoscale materials are limited. Here, we report a facile and scalable microwave approach to directly synthesize nanostructured Li2S from a glyme solution containing lithium polysulfides. As-synthesized Li2S presents an ideal architecture for the construction of free-standing cathodes for all-solid-state Li-S batteries.

The influence of preparation method on the structure of the composite materials was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As compared to the S/MWCNT-1 composite, the sulfur in the S/MWCNT-2 composite was highly dispersed and partially embedded into the pores and hollow tubes of carbon nanotubes, leading to suppress the shuttle mechanism and therefore improve the discharge capacity and the cycle stability. The S/MWCNT-2 composite showed an initial discharge capacity of 866 mAh g(-1) and a capacity retention of 69% after 50 cycles at 0.5 C rate, much higher than S/MWCNT-1 composite. The impact of morphology of the composite electrodes on the electrochemical performance was further investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and SEM techniques. Compared with the S/MWCNT-1 composite, the S/MWCNT-2 cathode well maintained its homogeneous and porous morphology after 50 cycles and a less formation of passive layer on the cathode surface was observed.

Herein, we develop a newly configured lithiated silicon-sulfur battery by using a honeycomb-like sulfur copolymer on 3D graphene (3D cpS-G) as the cathode and a 3D lithiated Si-G network as the anode. In the case of 3D cpS-G, the honeycomb-like sulfur copolymer are uniformly distributed on three-dimensional graphene networks. Such a unique cathode not only facilitates the fast diffusions of electron and lithium, but can also efficiently inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accommodate the large volume change of the sulfur copolymer during cycling processes. When assembled as half cells, the 3D cpS-G exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. More attractive is that when coupled with the 3D lithiated Si-G anode, the full Si-S cell exhibits superior electrochemical performances in term of a high reversible capacity of 620 mA h g(-1), an ultrahigh energy density of 1147 W h kg(-1) (based on the total mass of the cathode and the anode), good high-rate capability and excellent cycle performance over 500 cycles (0.028% capacity loss per cycle).

Herein, we enhanced the physical immobilization efficiency of sulfur through deliberate design of a carbon nanostructure, which integrated microporous, mesoporous and hollow nanostructures into a micrometer-sized particle. A hierarchical morphology of hollow carbon nanosphere clusters (HCNCs) was fabricated for the first time using a colloid chemistry route combined with spray drying technology. The as-prepared HCNCs have numerous interior hollows achieving higher sulfur-loading and buffering volume expansion, mesoporous channels for rapid ion transfer, and a microporous carbon sheath minimizing lithium polysulfide shuttling. This unique carbon architecture endowed HCNCs/S composites with superior cyclability and rate capability. They could deliver a high initial capacity of 1311 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and a reversible capacity of 695 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles with a low capacity fading rate of 0.094% per cycle. The sulfur cathode demonstrated good rate capability, with 592 mA h g(-1) at 5C. Integrating different morphologies and pore structures can embody the merits and mitigate the shortcomings of every individual component, which can be an effective path for future development of high-rate and long-cycle Li-S batteries.

Herein, a simple novel synthetic approach has been presented to realize porous vanadium nitride oxide (VOxNy) nanoparticles spatially decorated within nitrogen doped reduced graphene aerogel (VONNG) via concurrent in-situ nitridation and carbonization processes. Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene aerogel enhances the physical retention and polar interaction of LiPS and contributes toward the overall conductivity of the matrix. Whereas, vanadium nitride oxide has exhibited a redox potential window intermediate to its oxides' counterparts around which LiPS can form polythionate complexes to enhance the kinetics and LiPS retention by exploiting the V-N and V-O interfaces at cathode. The interaction mechanism has been probed through in-operando Raman spectroscopy, XPS and electroanalytical methods. The assembled cells from VONNG/S cathodes exhibit the initial discharge capacity of 1400 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C, 1250 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintained reversible capacity about 700 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 200 cycles. The loss in capacity is less than 0.05% per cycle for 850 cycles with Coulombic efficiency close to 99% even at 5C.

The fabricating process relies on two-step coating technique: firstly, high sulfur content slurry is coated on the current collector. After drying, the electrode is coated with another slurry composed of Super P and binder. The sulfur electrode with relatively high sulfur content/loading of 60 wt%/2 mg cm(-2) discharges capacity of similar to 695 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 100 cycling.

As-obtained C(4)NQDs are rich in carbonyl groups and edges, allowing good solution processability and facile assembly with other moieties for creating functionalities. While C(4)NQDs show normal fluorescence (FL), the QD/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites give FL/room-temperature-phosphorescence (RTP) dual-mode emission, enabling the corresponding solution to be used as an encryption ink. The QDs anchored onto carbon nanotubes can be used as a barrier layer to decorate commercial separators, endowing a Li-S cell with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability, and large areal capacity. Computation and experiment studies show that edge sites in C4N favor polysulfide adsorption and catalysis and the enriched edges and carbonyl groups in QDs synergically promotecatalytic conversion of sulfur species.

Traditional strategies to physically/chemically confine polysulfides within the pores of carbonaceous materials have resulted in limited success. In search of alternative mechanisms, herein, we present an intrinsic adsorption strategy to address both cycle life and rate capability issues in Li-S batteries. Combining experimental studies and spin-polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we have shown that nanostructured transition metal carbides (TMC) such as TiC and WC can adsorb polysulfides thereby enhancing the poly-sulfides' redox process. The combination of preferential surface adsorption of intermediate polysulfides and the reversible binding properties of lower order polysulfides on sulfiphilic metal carbide surfaces has resulted in a reversible capacity of 860 mA h g(-1) and stability over 100 charge/discharge cycles. Thus, nanostructured metal carbides with their exceptional adsorption capability towards dissolved polysulfides, could be an alternative electrode candidate for Li-S batteries.

However, up to now, the reaction mechanism within the Li-polysulfide batteries is still unclear. Herein, we study the reaction mechanism of a high-performance Li-polysulfide battery by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on a multifunctional host material composed of WS2 nanopetals embedded in rGO-CNT (WS2-rGO-CNT) aerogel. The WS2 nanopetal serves as a "catalytic center" to chemically bond the polysulfides and accelerate the polysulfide redox reactions, and the 3D porous rGO-CNT scaffold provides fast and efficient e(-)/Li+ transportation. Thus, the resulting WS2-rGO-CNT aerogel accommodating the polysulfide catholyte enables a stable cycling performance, excellent rate capability (614 mAh g(-1) at 2 C), and a high areal capacity (6.6 mAh cm(-2) at 0.5 C). In situ XRD results reveal that the Li2S starts to form at an early stage of discharge (at a depth of 25% of the lower voltage plateau) during the discharge process, and beta-S8 nucleation begins before the upper voltage plateau during the recharge process, which are different from the conventional Li-S battery. Moreover, the WS2 itself could be lithiated/delithiated during the cycling, making the lithiated WS2 (LixWS2, 0 <= x <= 0.3) a real host material for Li-polysulfide batteries. DFT calculations suggest that LixWS2 (0 <= x <= 0.3) exhibits moderate binding/anchoring interactions toward polysulfides with adsorption energies of 0.51-1.4 eV. Our work reveals the reaction mechanism of the Li-polysulfide batteries and indicates that the lithiated host plays an important role in trapping the polysulfides.

In this work, highly ordered N and S co-doped mesoporous carbon tubes (NSMCTBs) with high specific surface areas and large pore volume are employed to confine and improve the utilization efficiency of S species in Li-S batteries.

A relatively high discharge capacity of 1315.2 mAh g(-1) is achieved for the first cycle at 0.5 C and maintained at 644.1 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles. The NSMCTBs/S with high S content of up to 80%, it also delivers a discharge capacity of 1092.1 mAh g(-1) and considerable cycling performance.

Defects (such as intrinsic defects and oxygen-containing defects) on biomass carbon surface are benefit for capturing sulfur. Two defects play different roles during reaction process. The limited loading capacity of one kind of defect forces researchers to combine two defects to achieve high sulfur-loading. Activation process of biomass carbon can lead to increasing contents of two defects on carbon surface to achieve high sulfur loads (> 80 wt%). However, the role of activation process on defects and polysulfide conversion abilities of activated carbon still needs to be solved. Studying defect changes of activated carbon on polysulfide-capturing and transforming abilities becomes essential. In our work, high-temperature carbonization process is used to obtain biomass carbon. Defect contents change after activation process and polysulfide conversion abilities are also studied. Results show that carbon materials with equal contents of intrinsic defects and oxygen-containing defects possess enhanced abilities to capture and transform polysulfides on their surface. Intrinsic defects promote conversion abilities of polysulfides and oxygen-containing defects promote capturing abilities of polysulfides. Under synergy effects of two defects, carbon electrodes possess high capacities in P2 parts (conversion process from Li2Sx to Li2S) under conditions of high sulfur loads (80 wt%) and high 4 current densities (20 C), achieving excellent rate performance.

The most common is the use of different porous carbons which normally are hydrophobic and hardly retain the polar discharge products of the Li/S reaction, such as Li2S and lithium polysulfides (LiPs), at the working electrode. Functionalized hosts have been proposed as a strategy to improve LiPs interactions, including the use of heteroatom doping, organic frameworks, metals, metal oxides, sulfide particles, and conductive polymers. Despite demonstrating an improved cycle life, the functionalized structures often have an intrinsic limitation related to a low electronic conductivity resulting in slow kinetics and poor rate capability of Li/S cells. Herein, recent research trends aimed at designing sulfur electrodes with highly conductive functional groups on nanostructured hosts surface are reviewed. The main concepts, key developments, and parameters for building 3D hosts architectures that enable fast charge rates and long cycle life at high sulfur loadings are discussed.

Microstructure and electrochemical properties of mesoporous carbon were characterized. It was found that the optimal preparation conditions were template/pitch mass ratio of 1:1, carbonization temperature of 900 degrees C, and heating rate of 1 degrees C.min(-1). The optimal sample exhibits highly ordered two-dimensional hexagonal channels, with specific surface area of 675 m(2).g(-1), pore volume of 1 cm(3).g(-1), and pore diameter concentrated at about 3.84 nm.

And its applications as promising interlayer to hybridize with metal Li as composite anode for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) were systematically investigated and researched. The 3D interconnected porous skeleton with a high electrical conductivity and large surface area could reduce the local current density and endow the significantly enhanced interfacial compatibility between the interlayer and lithium electrode including a high lithium-loading capacity. Moreover, the lithiophilic ZnF2 nanoparticles formed in-situ during carbonization process could provide more active sites to trigger an analogous alloying reaction with Li to guide the Li plating/stripping more homogeneous. For the assembled Li parallel to LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries with ZnF2-PCNFs, the optimal initial discharge capacity and capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1C were 142.70 mAh g(-1) and 96.42%, respectively. The symmetric Li parallel to Li batteries further showed that the ZnF2-PCNFs coating interlayer could hinder Li dendrite growth and improve the cycling stability. In addition, the obtained Li parallel to S battery with ZnF2-PCNFs also delivered the outstanding cycle performance among the various samples based on the convenient transport channels of Li ions and the strong adsorption or captured ability of ZnF2-PCNFs to species. These facts demonstrated that the prepared ZnF2-PCNFs coating acting as interlayer between separator and anode could effectively enhance safety and electrochemical performance of LMBs.

To effectively address these technical issues, in this work, oxygen deficient CeO2-x & nbsp;nanorods (NR) decorated on free-standing carbon cloth (CeO2-x NR@CC) were used as a promising dual-functional cathode host material to enhance the electrochemical and cycling performance of Li-S batteries. The oxygen-deficient CeO2-x NR were prepared in a facile processing route by tuning the surface structures of pristine CeO2 NR in strong reducing NaBH4 solution. In contrast to the pristine CeO2NR@CC control sample, chemically etched CeO2-x & nbsp;NR@CC with abundant implanted oxygen vacancies effectively trapped the polysulfides and dramatically accelerated electron charge transfer, leading to faster redox kinetics. The main working mechanism of CeO2-x NR@CC on the improved electrochemical performance was attributed to chemical binding effect on trapping lithium polysulfides and even promoting the conversion of polysulfides, thanks to reversible Ce3+/Ce(4+& nbsp;)transformation, oxygen vacancies, and other surface defects. Hence, the CeO2-x & nbsp;NR@CC electrode delivered an outstanding initial capacity of 1358 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C for the 1st cycle and a superb sulfur utilization of 81%, compared to an initial capacity of 1176 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and a sulfur utilization of 70% for the CeO2 NR@CC electrode. The improved electrochemical performances of the CeO2-x NR@CC electrode can be mainly attributed to the successful adsorption of more dissolvable polysulfides by the dual-functional cathode host materials that combine the physical confinement of conductive CC and the chemical binding of CeO2-x NR with ample surface defects.

However, conventional preparing porous carbon through zeolite or silica templates casting has been criticized by the costly and/or toxic procedure. Creating three-dimensional (3D) carbon products is another challenge. Here, we report a facile way to prepare porous carbons from metal-organic gel (MOG) template, an extended metal-organic framework (MOF) structure. We surprisingly found that the carbon products inherit the highly porous nature of MOF and combine with gel's integrated character, which results in hierarchical porous architectures with ultrahigh surface areas and quite large pore volumes. They exhibit considerable hydrogen uptake and excellent electrochemical performance as cathode material for lithium-sulfur battery. This work provides a general method to fast and clean synthesis of porous carbon materials and opens new avenues for the application of metal-organic gel in energy storage.

The commercial realization of Li-S batteries is still hampered by reduced cycle life associated with the formation of electrolyte soluble higher-order polysulphide (Li2Sx, x = 4-8) intermediates, leading to capacity fading, self-discharge, and a multistep voltage profile. Herein, we have realized a practical approach towards a direct transformation of sulphur to Li2S2/Li2S in lithium-sulphur batteries by alteration of the reaction pathway. A coconut shell derived ultramicroporous carbon-sulphur composite cathode has been used as reaction directing template for the sulphur. The lithiation/delithiation and capacity fading mechanism of microporous carbon confined sulphur composite was revealed by analyzing the subsurface using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. No higher-order polysulphides were detected in the electrolyte, on the surface, and in the subsurface of the cathode composite. The altered reaction pathway is reflected by a single-step profile in the discharge/charge of a lithium-sulphur cell.	[Helen, M.; Reddy, M. Anji; Behm, R.

The novel design allows investigations of the liquid electrolyte phase, in a commercial coin cell geometry, at C rates much higher than conventional in situ cells. We use ATR FT-IR spectroscopy, coupled with a previously developed polysulfide diagnostic to quantify the evolution of lithium polysulfides during the discharge and charge cycles of a Li-S cell. The trends observed in the polysulfide order and concentration with respect to state of charge are consistent with prevailing understanding of the electrochemical mechanisms of Li-S battery operation. During discharge, we observe the reduction of elemental sulfur to dissolved Li2S8 polysulfides, and their cascading conversion to smaller polysulfides until insoluble species (Li2S2 and Li2S) are formed. During cell charging, we observe the oxidation of insoluble polysulfides to larger, soluble polysulfides (Li2Sn, n>3), and infer an eventual recovery of crystalline sulfur, from changes in polysulfides. Long-term evolution of polysulfides is observed over 7 discharge/charge cycles. Capacity fading is evident in the decay of polysulfide order and concentration at the same state of charge between cycles. Sulfur is not recovered by charging the cell in the latter cycles, and the active material is lost as solid Li2S. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This Co3O4/Reduced graphene oxide/Melamine derived carbon foam (Co3O4/RGO/MDCF) hybrid with a continuous conductive network and low bulk density of 10.6 mg/cm(3) exhibits high specific microwave absorption performance. The maximum Reflection Loss (RL) value of -31.88 dB at 11.54 GHz and a qualified bandwidth of 3.4 GHz (RL <= -10dB) with the coating layer thickness of only 2.0 mm under 10 wt% loading was achieved by Co3O4/RGO/MDCF composite. Notably our work provides a general and low-cost method to fabricate comprehensive microwave absorption materials with high RL value, low density, thin thickness and low loading content, which can be applied on scale and meet the requirement for the new type of electromagnetic wave absorptive material.

In order to improve electrochemical performance of potassium-selenium (K-Se) batteries, we prepared porous carbon/Se (PC/Se) composite via carbonization, KOH activation and melt diffusion and synthesized a novel porous carbon/Se/graphene oxide (PC/Se/GO) composite with the Se content of similar to 40 % via controlling the ionic strength of the solution as cathode material in the work. The combination of porous carbon structure and graphene can effectively relieve the volume expansion of selenium during the charge and discharge process, and provide excellent conductivity. The one-step conversion without polyselenides between the PC/Se/GO composite and metal potassium further improves the capacity and cycling stability. Therefore, the PC/Se/GO delivers high discharge capacities of 426.3 and 316.8 mAh g(-1) in the 2nd and 150th cycles at 0.5 C. This work plays an important reference role for the exploration of advanced potassium-selenium batteries.

The obtained S0.6Se0.4@CNFs film can be used as cathode material for high-performance Li-S batteries and room temperature (RT) Na-S batteries directly. The superior lithium/sodium storage performance derives from its rational structure design, such as the chemical bonding between Se and S, the chemical bonding between S0.6Se0.4 and CNFs matrix, and the 3D CNFs network. This easy one-step synthesis procedure provides a feasible route to prepare electrode materials for high-performance Li-S and RT Na-S batteries.

In this type of electrolytes, polysulfide dissolution and shuttling can be suppressed, resulting in high Coulombic efficiency and cycle life. To optimize the electrolytes for high energy density cells, effects of polysulfide solubility and Li ion transport properties on Li-S battery performance were investigated for tetraglyme (G4)-based solvate ionic liquids [Li(G4)(x)][TFSA] and a sulfolane (SL)-based concentrated electrolyte [Li(SL)(2)][TFSA], which are both diluted with a hydrofluoroether (HFE). The Li2S8 solubility is low (1 mM in atomic S concentration) in [Li(G4)(0.8)][TFSA]-4.3HFE and [Li(SL)(2)][TFSA]-4.0HFE. Cells with [Li(SL)(2)][TFSA]-4.0HFE exhibited better rate capability despite their lower ionic conductivity. The higher transference number (t(Li)(+)) of [Li(SL)(2)][TFSA]-4.0HFE may predominantly contribute to the rate performance, rather than polysulfide solubility and ionic conductivity. Furthermore, [Li(SL)(2)][TFSA]-4.0HFE demonstrated an initial discharge capacity of 1130 mAh g(-1) at a low electrolyte volume to sulfur weight ratio of 4, whereas a typical organic electrolyte failed to achieve such a high capacity owing to limitations of the redox mechanism mediated by dissolved polysulfides. In addition to the low solubility of polysulfides, the high t(Li)(+) is crucial for achieving high energy density Li-S batteries by reducing the electrolyte amount. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Herein, we develop a self-propelled nanoemulsion assembly of organosilane approach to fabricate monodispersed HCSs. In this approach, volatile oils are severed as self-elimination soft template and organosilane both as carbon precursor and in-situ pore-template. The key to the synthesis is the self-propelled formation of oil-in-water nanoemulsion stabilized by amphipathic hydrolyzed organosilane, which could hydrolyze at the oil-water interface and condense to form the polysilsesquioxane shell. The present approach has good controllability and universality that can be demonstrated by modulating alternative volatile oils, organosilane precursors and dry condition. After carbonization and NaOH treatment, the as-prepared HCSs have uniform particle size of similar to 900 nm, large cavity, controllable carbon shell of 80-110 nm, and high surface area up to 2300 m(2)/g. The unique integration of high-surface-area and well-defined hollow spherical morphology make them a great potential as electrode materials for supercapacitive energy storage and carbon host for lithium sulfur batteries. These findings could inspire more novel methodologies for constructing of high-surface-area yet well-defined nanostructured materials for tackling energy issues.

The controlled synthesis technology forms spherical carbon aerogels with uniform and interconnected porous structures. The as-prepared materials display large specific surface area and excellent conductivity. The loaded sulfur composites as cathode materials exhibit high discharge capacity and excellent cycling performance. Particularly, the designed P2-Cd-CA/S electrode with 78.9 wt% sulfur presents an initial discharge capacity of 1318 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C. And it delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1189 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C and still maintains 871 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles. The enhanced performance is mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect of the inductive graphitization of a microtemplate (3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride) and the stronger anchoring for polysulfides of evenly distributed cadmium. Furthermore, the first-principles theoretical calculations further support the strong adsorption between CdO and polysulfides and affirmatively reveal the immobilizing mechanism.

Sulphur is incorporated in the micropores by solution impregnation followed by melt infusion. The resultant carbon sulphur (C/S) composite is wrapped in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to provide conductive pathways to access the sulphur in micropores and to protect the surface-adhered sulphur. The cathode material obtained from rGO wrapping delivers initial discharge capacity of 1103 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, maintaining a capacity of 626 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C with capacity loss of 0.2% per cycle for more than 100 cycles. In another cell configuration using carbon paper as an interlayer, discharge capacity has raised to 850 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and maintained 86% of its capacity for 100 cycles with excellent rate capability and high Coulombic efficiency. The good performance may be referred to excellent conductive networks, porous architecture of carbon spheres and adsorption of catholyte by fibrous interlayer that can effectively reduce the polysulfide shuttling.

In this article, a novel cobalt polysulfide/carbon nanofibers (C,N-CoxSy/CNF) film derived from zeo-litic imidazolate framework is first prepared by a facile strategy. The composite material with two-dimensional leaf-shaped nanoarray neatly grown on the surface of carbon nanofibers is composed of CoS, CoS2, Co9S8, N-doped carbon nanosheets, and carbon nanofibers. It is found that the composite can not only increase the contact area with the electrolyte but also provide abundant redox-active sites and a Faraday capacitance for the entire electrode. The C,N-CoxSy/CNF composite exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, including a high capacity of up to 1080F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and a good rate capability (80.4 % from 1 A g(-1) to 10 A g(-1)). A C,N-CoxSy/CNF//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device is assembled using C,N-CoxSy/CNF as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, showing high energy density (37.29 Wh kg(-1)@813.6 W kg(-1)) and good cycle stability (90.5% of initial specific capacitance at 10 g(-1) after 5000 cycles). This C,N-CoxSy/CNF composite material may also be used as a potential electrode for future lithium-ion batteries, zinc-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, etc. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, the dense MoS(2)micro-flowers assembled by cross-linked 2D MoS(2)nanoflakes planting on biomass-derived carbon fiber (CF) network (MoS2/CFs) are fabricated as multifunctional sulfur cathodes of LSBs. The 2D MoS(2)nanoflakes supported on CF provide abundant anchoring sites for strong adsorption, while the 3D flowerlike structure prevents lamellar aggregation of 2D MoS(2)nanoflakes. Importantly, the dense MoS(2)micro-flowers planting on the network weaved by biomass-derived CFs ensures the high electronic conductivity of the MoS2/CFs composite, sufficient electrode/electrolyte interaction, fast electron and Li(+)transportation. Moreover, the CF network weaved from cost-effective tissue paper reduces the cost of LSBs. Thus, the S-MoS2/CFs cathode exhibits a high rate capability (1149 and 608 mA h g(-1)are obtained at 0.2 C and 4 C, respectively), excellent cyclic performance with similar to 75% capacity retention and 99% Coulombic efficiency at 2 C after 500 cycles, corresponding to similar to 0.05% capacity fading per cycle only, as well as structure integrity during the discharge/charge process.

However, the production of energy from most renewable sources is intermittent and thus relies on the availability of electrical energy-storage systems with high capacity and at competitive cost. Lithium-sulfur batteries are among the most promising technologies in this respect due to a very high theoretical energy density (1675mAhg(-1)) and that the active material, sulfur, is abundant and inexpensive. However, a so far limited practical energy density, life time, and the scaleup of materials and production processes prevent their introduction into commercial applications. In this work, we report on a simple strategy to address these issues by using a new gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) that enables stable performance close to the theoretical capacity of a low cost sulfur-carbon composite with high loading of active material, that is, 70% sulfur. We show that the GPE prevents sulfur dissolution and reduces migration of polysulfide species to the anode. This functional mechanism of the GPE membranes is revealed by investigating both its morphology and the Li-anode/GPE interface at various states of discharge/charge using Raman spectroscopy.

Spatiotemporal Quantification of Lithium both in Electrode and in Electrolyte with Atomic Precision via Operando Neutron Absorption	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; SULFUR BATTERIES; IN-SITU; MECHANISM; CELLS	The commercial uptake of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is undermined by their rapid performance decay and short cycle life. These problems originate from the dissolution of lithium polysulfide in liquid electrolytes, causing charge and active material to shuttle between electrodes. The dynamics of intractable polysulfide migration at different length scales often tend to escape the probing ability of many analytical techniques. Spatial and temporal visualization of Li in Li-S electrodes and direct mechanistic understanding of how polysulfides are regulated across Li-S batteries starting from current collector and active layer coating to electrode-electrolyte interface are still lacking. To address this we employ neutron depth profiling across Li-S electrodes using the naturally occurring isotope, Li-6, which yields direct spatial information on Li-S electrochemistry. Using three types of Li-S electrodes, namely, carbon-sulfur, carbon-sulfur with 10% lithium titanium oxide (LTO), and carbon-sulfur with LTO membrane, we provide direct evidence for the migration, adsorption, and confinement of polysulfides in Li-S cells at work. Our findings further provide insights into the dynamics of polysulfide dissolution and re-utilization in relation to Li-S battery capacity and longevity to aid rational electrode designs toward high-energy, safe, and low-cost batteries.

The composite cathodes are organized in complex hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) architectures, which contain several components and are challenging to understand and characterize using any single technique. Here, multimode analytical scanning and transmission electron microscopies and energy-dispersive X-ray/electron energy-loss spectroscopies coupled with multivariate statistical analysis and tomography were applied to explore origins of the cathode-enhanced capacity retention. The surface topography, morphology, bonding, and compositions of the cathodes created by combining sulfur copolymers with varying 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene content and conductive carbons have been investigated at multiple scales in relation to the electrochemical performance and physico-mechanical stability. We demonstrate that replacing the elemental sulfur with organosulfur copolymers improves the compositional homogeneity and compatibility between carbons and sulfur-containing domains down to sub-5 nm length scales resulting in (a) intimate wetting of nanocarbons by the copolymers at interfaces; (b) the creation of 3D percolation networks of conductive pathways involving graphitic-like outer shells of aggregated carbons; (c) concomitant improvements in the stability with preserved meso-and nanoscale porosities required for efficient charge transport.

In this work, those issues are significantly relieved by entrapping sulfur species in carbon host rich in oxygen functionalities. Sulfur species in such C/S composite are highly stabilized by their interaction with oxygen, and can deliver a reversible capacity of 508 mAh/(g of S) for 2000 cycles when coupled with Li, representing the best cycling stability up to date. More interestingly, extra capacity can be accessed by simply prelithiating the oxygen-stabilized C/S composites down to 0.6 V for a few cycles, which enables a high capacity of 1621 mAh/(g of S) that eventually stabilizes at 820 mAh/(g of S) for 600 cycles. The mechanism for this electrochemical activation process is investigated with both spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, which reveal that the inactive sulfur bonded to oxygen is liberated in the initial deep lithiation precycles and becomes electrochemically active. The oxygen-stabilized sulfur can also be coupled with Na anode to form Na/S cell, confirming that the formation of S-O interaction in C/S composite generates promising sulfur-based cathode materials for Li-S and Na-S batteries.

The adsorption energy, band structure, light absorption coefficient and reflectivity are calculated through it. In the current research area, it is found that the coverage has little effect on the adsorption of the system, but the C atoms are pulled up, the graphene plane is distorted, and the band gap of the graphene is opened, which changes graphene from quasi-metal to semiconductors. S-adsorbed graphene system has a blueshift relative to the intrinsic graphene, and the degree of blueshift increases with the increase of coverage. The reflectivity of the system is higher than that of the unabsorbed S atom system. Torsional deformation has a large effect on its band gap. It makes the adsorption system reduce the adsorption energy and the stability. The band structure shows that the band gap decreases as the twist angle increases. The twisted S-adsorbed graphene system shows a slight redshift, and the degree of redshift increases with the angle. The maximum reflectance of the S-adsorbed graphene system with torsional deformation is stronger than that of the untwisted system.

The corncob provides both a carbon source and a small amount of Fe as the catalyst, while melamine offers a nitrogen source. Corncobs were firstly pretreated with concentrated sulfuric acid and then mixed with melamine. After calcination at 800 degrees C for 2 hours, a new composite carbon material with a unique structure with a large amount of thin walled nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes orderly and vertically growing on the mesoporous carbon frame was obtained. The diameter of nanotubes is similar to 50 nm while their length varies from 0.1-20 mu m, which could be controlled by adjusting the ratio of pretreated corncob to melamine. Meanwhile, the composite material possesses stable interconnected pores and channels with a high surface area of 1100 m(2) g(-1), which significantly accelerated the transfer rates of ions and electrons. The electrochemical test results demonstrated that this composite material exhibits a superior capacitance of 538 F g(-1) in an aqueous electrolyte and 320 F g(-1) in an organic electrolyte at a current density of 1 A g(-1). The specific capacitance of the composite material remained up to 90% of the initial value after 10 000 cycles, showing excellent long-term cycling stability. For lithium sulfur battery application, the composite material as a sulfur host delivered an initial capacity of 1047 mA h g(-1), and exhibited a relatively stable cycling performance, maintained a capacity of 682 mA h g(-1) for 300 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5C. The structure, morphology and growth mechanism of the composite material were also analyzed and discussed in detail.

In this work, a nitrogen-doped 3D porous agaric carbon (N-AC) with high specific surface area (1568.2 m(2) g(-1)) was fabricated without adding any activator by using the agaric hydrogel as a precursor. And when employed as a sulfur host, the resulted N-AC-sulfur composite electrode with 60 wt% sulfur content illustrates a high reversible capacity of 875 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) over 100 cycles as well as an excellent rate capability of 620 mAh g(-1) at 2 C. Such excellent electrochemical performances could attribute to (1) the conductive carbon skeleton of N-AC that provides rapid electron/ion transfer; (2) abundant pores range from micropores to macropores in N-AC that are beneficial to accommodating the active sulfur and polysulfides and (3) the nitrogen dopants that provide polarized sites in chemical binding of polysulfides. In a word, this work provides a compelling avenue to the design of multifunctional sulfur host for advanced Li-S batteries.

In comparison with conventional methods, this green approach uses environmental precursors in the preparation of graphene products. The resulting crystalline graphene foam product exhibited a uniform structure with large surface area. These appealing features render the prepared graphene foam product a prospective backbone for producing 3D charge-transport networks. The 3D graphene foam products were employed as the skeleton with an interconnected network for lithium-ion batteries. The lithium-ion batteries with the 3D porous foam structure exhibit superior cycling stability and good rate capability. There is no capacity loss after 800 cycles because the capacity stabilized for the first few cycles, and the lithium-ion batteries with 3D graphene foam showed a discharge capacity of 180 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1). This superior cycling stability and good rate capability was ascribed to the 3D structure with an interconnected porous network and the nitrogen-doping strategy for improved conductive properties of graphene foam, which produces an efficient 3D charge-transport network. The configuration of this 3D transport network in lithium-ion cells not only can improve the electron-transport efficiency but also can suppress the volume effect during charge/discharge cycling. Besides, nitrogen doping could enhance the formation of chemical bonding between carbon and the nearby nitrogen atoms, which could accelerate the diffusion of lithium ions through the whole graphene network.

Sulfur encapsulation by MOF-derived CoS2 embedded in carbon hosts for high-performance Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; DOUBLE-SHELLED NANOCAGES; POLYSULFIDE MEDIATOR; RATIONAL DESIGN; ENERGY-STORAGE; DOPED CARBON; LITHIUM; CATHODE; SURFACE; NANOMATERIALS	Li-S batteries have attracted great attention for their combined advantages of potentially high energy density and low cost. To tackle the capacity fade from polysulfide dissolution, we have developed a confinement approach by in situ encapsulating sulfur with a MOF-derived CoS2 in a carbon framework (S/Z-CoS2), which in turn was derived from a sulfur/ZIF-67 composite (S/ZIF-67) via heat treatment. The formation of CoS2 was confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and its microstructure and chemical composition were examined through cryogenic scanning/transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-S/TEM) imaging with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX). Quantitative EDX suggests that sulfur resides inside the cages, rather than externally. S/hollow ZIF-67-derived CoS2 (S/H-CoS2) was rationally designed to serve as a control material to explore the efficiency of such hollow structures. Cryo-STEM-EDX mapping indicates that the majority of sulfur in S/H-CoS2 stays outside of the host, despite its high void volumetric fraction of similar to 85%. The S/Z-CoS2 composite exhibited highly improved battery performance, when compared to both S/ZIF-67 and S/H-CoS2, due to both the efficient physical confinement of sulfur inside the host and strong chemical interactions between CoS2 and sulfur/polysulfides. Electrochemical kinetics investigations revealed that the CoS2 could serve as an electrocatalyst to accelerate the redox reactions. The composite could provide an areal capacity of 2.2 mA h cm(-2) after 150 cycles at 0.2C and 1.5 mA h cm(-2) at 1C. This novel material provides valuable insights for further development of high-energy, high-rate and long-life Li-S batteries.

However, the surface functional groups, such as -OH and -F, weaken the ability of bare MXenes in the chemisorption of polysulfides. Besides, they create numerous hydrogen bonds which make MXenes liable to restack, resulting in substantial loss of active area and, thus, inaccessibility of ions and electrolyte. Herein, a facile, one-step strategy is developed for the growth of TiO2 quantum dots (QDs) on ultrathin MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-assisted solvothermal synthesis. These QDs act as spacers to isolate the MXene nanosheets from restacking, and preserve their 2D geometry which guarantees larger electrode-electrolyte contact area and higher sulfur loading. The stronger adsorption energy of polysulfides with TiO2 (than with Ti3C2Tx), as proven by density functional theory calculations, is essential for better on-site polysulfide retention. The ultrathin nature and protected conductivity ensure rapid ion and electron diffusion, and the excellent flexibility maintains high mechanical integrity. In result, the TiO2 QDs@MXene/S cathode exhibits significantly improved long-term cyclability and rate capability, disclosing a new opportunity toward fast and stable Li-S batteries.

In addition, the severe sedimentation problem of nonconductive Li2S during the charging process would inevitably hamper the subsequent reaction kinetics of Li-S batteries, especially at high sulfur loading. Herein, this paper, for the first time, reports the construction of a highly conductive sulfur host material (C@NiSe2) by simulating the decomposition process of Li2S on the surface of anchor materials, which confirmed that NiSe2 is more suitable for the Li2S oxidation process. In addition, the strong binding strength of NiSe2 with Li2S is better for the decomposition of Li2S during the charge process. Therefore, when C@NiSe2 is used as the electrode material, the batteries exhibited an initial capacity of 1250 mA h g(-1) with a quite low cycle decay of 0.089% per cycle with a sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2) at 0.2C. At a high current density of 5C, the battery showed an ultralow cycle decay of 0.019% during 2000 cycles. In addition, with an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 12.0 mg cm(-2), the C@NiSe2/S electrode could still deliver a significant areal capacity of 9.96 mA h cm(-2), which is good for realizing practical applications of Li-S batteries.

The composites are made by the physical mixing and S-liquefied pore-filling processes with nano sulfur powder and two kinds of porous carbons. The initial discharge capacities of the composite prepared by the physical mixing and liquefied pore-filling with 1-mu m-sized carbon were 1060 mAh/g and 1121 mAh/g, respectively. On the other hand, the capacities of the composite using 5-mu m-sized carbon were 705 mAh/g in physical mixing and 845 mAh/g in the liquefied pore-filling process. The composite with the 1-mu m carbon showed approximately similar to 1.4 times higher than that of 5 mu m. The reason for this difference is that the surface area of the sulfur wrapping the small particle carbon surface is larger than that of the composite wrapping the large particle carbon surface. Importantly, after 500 cycles, the cycle stability in the physical mixing process is 15 similar to 30% higher than that in the S-liquefied pore-filling process in both carbons, due to the decrease of electrolyte resistance by capturing polysulfide into the pores which are not filled by the sulfur during the process. In the case of high-sulfur loading composites, the manufacturing process as well as the size and morphologies of the carbon are crucial factors that affect the capacity and cycle stability of the Li-S battery.

Li-S batteries may represent a next-generation energy storage system, particularly for large scale applications. The obstacles to realize this high energy density mainly include high internal resistance, self-discharge and rapid capacity fading on cycling. These challenges can be met to a large degree by designing novel sulfur electrodes with "smart'' nanostructures. This highlight provides an overview of major developments of positive electrodes based on this concept.

However, it is difficult to effectively balance the conflict between a high S loading ( > 45 wt%) and cycling stability for S-PAN. In this work, we employed an in situ wrapping method to improve the cycling performance of high-S-content S-PAN. Compared with the unwrapped S-PAN, the capacity retention ratio of the wrapped S-PAN cathode increased from 38% to 62% after 100 cycles at 0.25C. The analyzed results suggested that the wrapping layer on the high-S-content S-PAN may compose a mixture of sulfide, inorganic LiBxOy and some organic compounds.

By substituting carbon atoms with heteroatoms, the host materials can provide a chemical interaction with PS to trap it within the electrochemically active range of the cathode. In this study, first-principles-based calculations identify the most stable nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) codoped atomic structures and their corresponding adsorption energy toward different PS species. Based on the simulated predictions, we introduce a glucosamine-derived carbon nanotube aerogel (CNA) with a secondary dopant of P during the synergetic polymerization and carbonization process.

Here, through extensive computer simulations, we uncover the strongly favorable interfacial free energy between liquid sulfur and graphitic surfaces that underlies this phenomenon. Previously unexplored curvature-dependent enhancements are shown to favor the filling of smaller pores first and effect a quasi-liquid sulfur phase in microporous domains (diameters <2 nm) that persists similar to 30 degrees below the expected freezing point. Evidence of interfacial sulfur on carbon is shown to be a 0.3 eV red shift in the simulated and measured interfacial X-ray absorption spectra. Our results elucidate the critical morphology and thermodynamic properties necessary for future cathode design and highlight the importance of molecular-scale details in defining emergent properties of functional nanoscale interfaces.

They have been the subject of much research due to their prominent surface areas, porosity, light weight, and excellent conductivity. The performance of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) is highly related to the morphology of porous carbon electrodes, where high surface area and pore size distribution are proportional to capacitance to a significant extent. In this work, we designed and synthesized several activated carbons based on lignin for both supercapacitors and Li-S batteries. Our most favorable synthesized carbon material had a very high specific surface area (1832 m(2)center dot g(-1)) and excellent pore diameter (3.6 nm), delivering a specific capacitance of 131 F center dot g(-1) in our EDLC for the initial cycle. This translates to an energy density of the supercapacitor cell at 55.6 Wh center dot kg(-1). Using this material for Li-S cells, composited with a nickel-rich phosphide and sulfur, showed good retention of soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates by maintaining a specific capacity of 545 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) for more than 180 cycles at 0.2 C.

Herein, a cobalt-doped SnS2 anchored on N-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT@Co-SnS2) substrate is rationally designed as both a polysulfide shield to mitigate the shuttling effects and an electrocatalyst to improve the interconversion kinetics from polysulfides to Li2S. As a result, high-S-loading cathodes are demonstrated to achieve good cycling stability with high sulfur utilization. It is shown that Co-doping plays an important role in realizing high initial capacity and good capacity retention for Li-S batteries. The S/NCNT@Co-SnS2 cell (3 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading) delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1337.1 mA h g(-1) (excluding the Co-SnS2 capacity contribution) and 1004.3 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 1.3 mA cm(-2), while the counterpart cell (S/NCNT@SnS2) only shows an initial capacity of 1074.7 and 843 mA h g(-1) at the 100th cycle. The synergy effect of polysulfide confinement and catalyzed polysulfide conversion provides an effective strategy in improving the electrochemical performance for high-sulfur-loading Li-S batteries.

Here, we report a novel and simple route using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods to fabricate bead-like nitrogen-doped CNT/graphene composites (NCNT/G) via a simple pyrolysis of the N-rich melamine in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) as a substrate using a Mn-NiCo ternary catalyst. We have characterized these structures by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, isothermal analyses, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The three dimensional NCNT/G hybrids have unique network structures, moderate graphitization, high specific surface area, good mesoporosity, and N doping, which makes them promising materials for applications in energy storage and conversion.

Herein, we show that N, O-codoped carbon with a tri-modal hierarchical porous structure derived from biomass can be used as a novel sulfur host for stable LSBs. The abundant heteroatoms of the biomass-derived carbon material significantly improve the adsorption and conversion of LiPSs through chemical interaction, leading to long-term stable cycling of LSBs. Additionally, the interconnected hierarchical porous structure provides efficient pathways for charge transport and alleviates the volume expansion of sulfur during the lithiation process. With respect to synergistic effects of the tri-modal porous structure and dual-heteroatom doped property, the biomass-derived carbon material delivers an initial capacity of 1123 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, with a low capacity decay rate of 0.057% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1C. This work represents a sustainable approach for developing highly stable and long-lived LSBs.

A CNF obtained through a template free synthesis approach and activated with KOH is endowed with a high specific surface area of 1000 m(2) g(-1), a desirable nitrogen content (13%) to ensure polarity and a microporous architecture, required to increase the accommodation capability of discharge products. The difference in electronegativity between C and N in CNFs combats in a major way the shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LIPSs) and ensures the realization of increased LIPS binding sites due to the presence of pyridinic nitrogen. Furthermore, a CNF driven change in the molecular configuration of adsorbed LIPSs leads to the uniform distribution and sequestration of discharge products. Similarly, micropores and the polymeric nature of CNFs facilitate the effective confinement of LIPSs and ably accommodate the volume changes (through the formation of Li2S upon discharge) respectively, especially when a microporous CNF interlayer is involved in the Li-S assembly. In particular, a CNF with 60 wt% sulfur loading, otherwise represented as CNFS-60, when exploited as a cathode in combination with the deployment of a CNF interlayer exhibits appreciable capacity values of 500 and 400 mA h g(-1) at 3 and 5C respectively. Furthermore, the combination of the CNF interlayer and cathode demonstrates a steady state discharge capacity of 437 mA h g(-1) at 1C rate up to 300 cycles, without any significant capacity loss. The involvement of chemical interaction of the CNF with lithium polysulfides is demonstrated using density functional theory calculations. Hence, the effective trapping and the subsequent localization of migrating LIPSs arising from the strong chemical interaction of the CNF with soluble LIPSs and the advantages of high concentration of accessible pyridinic nitrogen sites to the LIPS adsorption in improving the electrochemical behavior of the Li-S system could be understood. This new CNF based interlayer provides a promising approach and ample scope for its implementation in futuristic Li-S batteries.

In situ synthesis of lithium sulfide-carbon composites as cathode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							SULFUR BATTERIES; CELL ELECTROLYTE; CYCLE LIFE; PERFORMANCE; ENERGY; SPECTROSCOPY; NANOTUBES; GELS	Lithium-sulfur batteries are among the most promising candidates for next-generation rechargeable lithium batteries in view of recent progress on sulfur-carbon composite cathodes. However, further progress on such batteries is hampered by their concomitant need for a metallic lithium anode, which introduces new challenges associated with uneven electrodeposition and lithium dendrite formation. Here we report a method of creating lithium sulfide-carbon composites as cathode materials, which can be paired with high-capacity anodes other than metallic lithium. Lithium sulfide is dispersed in a porous carbon matrix, which serves to improve its electrical conductivity and provides a framework for sequestration of sulfur and lithium polysulfides. The in situ synthesis approach allows facile, scalable synthesis of lithium sulfide-carbon composite materials that exhibit improved electrochemical properties. We also investigate the effect of lithium polysulfides dissolved in the electrolyte on the stability and cycling behavior of Li2S-carbon composite cathodes.

However, porous carbons suffer from a compromise between porosity, doped functionality, and nanostructure that have thus far restricted their performances. Here, we report the design of highly porous, nitrogenenriched hollow carbon nanospheres (PN-HCNs) by an interfacial copolymerization strategy followed by NH3-assisted carbonization, and further demonstrate their significance and effectiveness in enhancing the electrochemical performances. The PN-HCN simultaneously delivers a large surface area (1237 m(2) g(-1)) and high N functionalities (6.25 atom %) with a remarkable efficiency of the surface area increase to N loss ratio enabled by NH3 treatment while inheriting the hollow nanospherical structure. Accordingly, owing to the enhanced surface area and retained N doping, the prepared PN-HCN demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performances as a cathode host in lithium-sulfur batteries, including a near-to-theoretical capacity of 1620 mAh g(-1), high rate capability and good cycling stability (789 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C after 200 cycles). These results are superior to those of HCN without NH 3 treatment. Also, PN-HCN exhibits superior capacitances (203 F g(-1)) and fast ion transport ability in supercapacitors. Our finding shows the simultaneous achievement of both highly porous structures and sufficient N functionalities for high-performance applications.

Herein, we have systematically studied the kinetic behaviors of Li-S chemistry on Co-based compounds with fixedmetal cation and varied non-metal anions, and deciphered the intrinsic modulation essence of the anions. Among the Co-based compounds, CoP exhibits the lowest overpotential for polysulfide transformation. Even at 40.0 C, S@CoP/rGO still delivers a high capacity of 417.3 mA hr g(-1) and an unprecedented power density of 137.3 kW kg(-1), representing the best rate performance. DFT analysis reveals that the performance variations mainly originate from the shift of p band centers, which modulate the interfacial electron transfer dynamics. This work could unlock the potential of band engineering for Li-S batteries and beyond.

However, the Li-S batteries often undergo rapid degradation due to the severe "shuttle effect", sluggish redox kinetics, and the insulator nature of sulfur. Herein, the Mn3O4-MnPx heterostructure was constructed via the in-situ crystallization of Mn3O4-MnPx on amorphous phosphrus (P) NPs-modified carbon nanosheets. According to the experimental test and density functional theory calculation, Mn3O4 exhibits strong adsorption ability towards polysulfides. Meanwhile, MnPx dramatically catalyzes the conversion reactions between sulfur and polysulfides. The synergistic effect of Mn3O4 and MnPx facilitates the facile redox kinetics and effective entrapment of polysulfides. As a result, the improved specific capacities of 1410 and 804 mA h g(-1) are obtained at 0.1 and 2 C, respectively. The capacity decay is only 0.041% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. This work indicuates that the interface regulation and design play an important role in advancing the electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries.

Herein, we simply split a polymer chain into a single chain to attract metal-cations, and then obtain a three-dimensional carbon fiber composite with in situ grown manganese oxide nanoparticles (MnO@N-CNFs) in the subsequent pyrolysis process. It can be used not only as an electrode material for supercapacitors, but also as a cathode host for lithium-sulfur batteries. After the capacitance performance test, MnO@N-CNFs were found to have a discharge capacity greater than the charge capacity. As a cathode host for a lithium-sulfur battery, they attract a large amount of polysulfide to accelerate conversion from the long-chain molecules to short-chain molecules, which can improve the kinetics during the electrochemical process.

During the charge and discharge of lithium sulfur batteries, high Li ion storage performance can be achieved on the composite electrode, which was benefited from both the aligned CNT structure and the polymer barrier. Aligned CNT framework afforded high conductivity for electron transportation and ordered pores for lithium ion transportation. Meanwhile, the PEG barrier layer greatly suppressed the shuttle of polysulfides. Therefore, this aligned sulfur-coated CNTs with a PEG barrier showed a high initial discharge capacity of 920 and 1128 mAh g(-1) in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide/1,3-dioxolane/1,2-dimethoxyethane and electrolyte with LiNO3 additives, respectively. The PEG coated cathode showed high cycle stability that a low degradation with 0.38% per cycle during the 100 cycles at 0.1 C was achieved in LiNO3-free electrolytes. These Li storage performance was superior to the aligned sulfur-coated CNT electrode without PEG barrier. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, high-performance lithium-selenium/sulfur batteries with a dual-confined cathode configuration by encapsulating SeS2 in double-layered hollow micro/mesoporous carbon spheres (DSMCs) with a conductive polyaniline (PANI) protection sheath are proposed. Polysulfides/polyselenides are efficiently restricted in the cathode via physical and chemical entrapment from DSMCs and PANI as well as chemical binding between selenium and sulfur. Benefiting from the distinct advantages of SeS2 and the well-constructed host framework, the cathode achieves high capacity utilization of 1018 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) , together with outstanding rate capability of 619 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) and excellent cycle life over 500 cycles with almost 100% Coulombic efficiency. The novel SexSy based cathode demonstrates a promising route to surmount some bottlenecks of current lithium-sulfur systems for high-performance rechargeable batteries.

BiFeO3 Coupled Polysulfide Trapping in C/S Composite Cathode Material for Li-S Batteries as Large Efficiency and High Rate Performance	ENERGIES			English	Article						Li-S battery; C; S composite; BFO coupling; polysulfide trapping	SULFUR; ELECTRODES	We demonstrated the efficient coupling of BiFeO3 (BFO) ferroelectric material within the carbon-sulfur (C-S) composite cathode, where polysulfides are trapped in BFO mesh, reducing the polysulfide shuttle impact, and thus resulting in an improved cyclic performance and an increase in capacity in Li-S batteries. Here, the built-in internal field due to BFO enhances polysulfide trapping. The observation of a difference in the diffusion behavior of polysulfides in BFO-coupled composites suggests more efficient trapping in BFO-modified C-S electrodes compared to pristine C-S composite cathodes. The X-ray diffraction results of BFO-C-S composite cathodes show an orthorhombic structure, while Raman spectra substantiate efficient coupling of BFO in C-S composites, in agreement with SEM images, showing the interconnected network of submicron-size sulfur composites. Two plateaus were observed at 1.75 V and 2.1 V in the charge/discharge characteristics of BFO-C-S composite cathodes. The observed capacity of ~1600 mAh g(-1) in a 1.5-2.5 V operating window for BFO30-C-10-S-60 composite cathodes, and the high cyclic stability substantiate the superior performance of the designed cathode materials due to the efficient reduction in the polysulfide shuttle effect in these composite cathodes.

Colloidal particles with different morphologies and sizes can be coated with high-quality RF resin shells by the proposed cationic surfactant assisted RF resin coating strategy. The as-synthesized RF resin coated nanocomposites are ideal candidates for selective synthesis of core-shell, hollow, and yolk-shell carbon nanostructures. Based on the carboxylic functional RF resin coating, graphitic carbon nanostructures can also be synthesized by employing the graphitization catalyst. The as-synthesized carbon nanostructures show the advantageous performances in several applications. Hollow carbon spheres are potential electrode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. Hollow graphitic spheres are promising catalyst supports for oxygen reduction reaction. And yolk-shell structured Au@HCS nanoreactors with ultrathin shells exhibit high catalytic activity and recyclability in confined catalysis.

In addition, the poor electron transport also limits the specific capacity of the element sulfur. Therefore, these two problems must be solved to achieve the high electrochemical performance of the lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we prepared NiCo2O4 materials via a facile method and designed it as the sulfur host materials in the lithium-sulfur batteries. The as-prepared NiCo2O4/S (NCO/S) composites showed excellent ability to stabilize the discharge products of the soluble polysulfide. Also, the NCO/S composites exhibit high electronic conductivity compared to the pure S cathode. As a result, the as-prepared NCO/S composites display high specific capacity and superior cycling stability.

In this work, we demonstrated that a "yolk-shell" structure with a polar silicon dioxide (SiO2) core in a hollow carbon sphere (SiO2@HC) acts as a highly efficient sulfur host. Such nanoarchitecture benefits from both a physical barrier and chemical adsorption via a carbon shell and a polar SiO2 core. Furthermore, the internal void space could buffer the huge volume expansion of active sulfur during lithiation. The resulting SiO2@ HC/S composite exhibits a high mass S loading (similar to 76 wt%), high initial specific capacity of 1200 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, superior rate performance (728 mA h g(-1) at 3C), ultraslow capacity decay of 0.056% per cycle at a high rate of 2C and an extraordinary anti-self-discharge feature.

Herein, a microporous carbon-coated sulfur composite with novel rambutan shape (R-S@MPC) is synthesized from microporous carbon-coated rambutan-like zinc sulfide (R-ZnS@MPC), via an in situ oxidation process. The R-ZnS is employed as both template and sulfur precursor. The carbon frame of R-S@MPC composite possesses three kinds of pores that are distinctly separated from each other in space and are endowed with the exclusive functions. The central macropore serves as buffer pool to accommodate the dissolved lithium polysulfides (LPSs) and volumetric variation during cycling. The marginal straight-through mesoporous, connected with the central macropore, takes the responsibility of sulfur storage. The micropores, evenly distributed in the outer carbon shell of the as-synthesized R-S@MPC, enable the blockage of LPSs. These pores are expected to perform their respective single function, and collaborate synergistically to suppress the sulfur loss. Therefore, it delivers an outstanding cycling stability, decay rate of 0.013% cycle(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C, when the sulfur loading is kept at 4 mg cm(-2).

The additive nitrogen-doped carbon dots maintain their "dissolved" status in the electrolyte at the full charge state, and some of them function as active sites for lithium sulfide growth at the full discharge state. When polysulfides are present amid the transition between sulfur and lithium sulfide, nitrogen-doped carbon dots become highly reactive with polysulfides to form a solid and recoverable polysulfide-encapsulating layer. This design skilfully avoids structural failure and efficiently suppresses polysulfide shuttling. The sulfur cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 891 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C with 99.5% coulombic efficiency and cycling stability up to 1000 cycles at 2 C. Inspired by the processes of thrombus formation and thrombolysis in blood vessels, the authors here construct an electrochemically recoverable protective layer of polysulfides using an electrolyte additive, realizing high performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, distinctive hollow structures of NiS2 (NiS2/C HSs) are developed to establish a double barrier of physical and chemical adsorption to prevent the migration of polysulfides and effectively accelerate the conversion of sulfur, which are verified by both theoretical computations and experiments. Attributed to the unique morphology and superior electrocatalytic activity of NiS2/C HSs, batteries with NiS2/C HSs can deliver excellent performance with a reversible capacity of 634 mA h g(-1) with 2.0 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading after 1000 cycles at 1.0C, which corresponds to a slight capacity fading rate of 0.017% per cycle. This work offers a simple MOF-derived strategy for the synthesis of NiS2/C HSs, holding great promise in developing practical applications of Li-S batteries with high energy density.

This phenomenon will lead to rapid capacity fading during the electrochemical cycles and poor cycling stability. Therefore, it is important to mitigate the polysulfide shuttle effect and accelerate the polysulfide conversion in the lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, iron sulfide nanosheets were successfully prepared and developed as sulfur host materials in the lithium-sulfur batteries. Due to the presence of the iron sulfide, the as-prepared iron sulfide/sulfur composites exhibit superior electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity, high rate performance, and stable cycling performance. This is attributed the efficient polysulfide conversion catalyzed by iron sulfide.

SEM, TEM and BET measurements reveal that through this approach, sulfur can subside together with carbon and then form the S/C composite in which sulfur particle is enclosed within the carbon shell even enter into the pores of Printex XE2 carbon. Comparing with sublimed sulfur, the sulfur or S/C composite deriving from the solvent exchange method all shows greatly improved electrochemical performance. Additionally, the influence of solvent on the electrochemical property of the S/C composite is investigated in terms of cycling tests, cyclic voltammetry and impedance measurements. The results show that the S/C composite sample derived from the ultrasonic solvent exchange method in o-xylene solvent has better electrochemical properties than that prepared in CS2. It delivers a capacity of 1173.9 mAh g(-1) in the initial cycle and preserves at 712.5 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). Furthermore, even at a high current density of 1500 mA g(-1), its discharge capacity is well maintained at 529 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, which is much higher than the capacity of 293.6 mAh g(-1) for sublimed sulfur electrode.

Most of the work reported so far concentrates on functionalizing the commercial Celgard (R) separator such that it can trap polysulfides, preventing their shuttling to Li anode. In this study, we have developed a flexible MgAl2O4 (MAO) separator, which plays a dual role as separator and polysulfide adsorber. To effectively utilize the adsorbed polysulfide on MAO, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were coated on MAO, which slows down the capacity decay of the Li-S battery. As a result, the Li-S cell with MAO/MWCNT separator delivers a stable capacity of similar to 500 mA h g(-1) for 250 cycles, higher than the capacity delivered by the Li-S cell with Celgard (R) separator. Furthermore, UV-Visible spectroscopy of the polysulfide solution exposed to MAO demonstrates polysulfide's binding ability with MAO. Furthermore, our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the adsorption of polysulfides on the MAO.

However, a majority of MOFs have strict requirements for preparation and high mass transfer resistance that limits the gas separation time. In order to improve the applicability of MOFs to practical applications, herein, we reported an experimental approach to prepare structured CuBTC/graphene aerogel (GA) composites using ionic liquid (IL) additives (CuBTC/GA-IL) at room temperature for CO2 capture. The material was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), specific surface area analysis, and CO2 adsorption tests. It was demonstrated that CuBTC/GA-IL exhibited the higher CO2 uptake than CuBTC/GA prepared without IL additives. Besides, the breakthrough experiments have shown that CuBTC/GA-IL exhibited the lower mass transfer resistance compared with CuBTC-IL and good cyclability. The effective approach of fabricating CuBTC into GA using IL additives to improve CO2 adsorption in this study may be extensively applied for other MOF-based composites.

Synergy of nanoconfinement and surface oxygen in recrystallization of sulfur melt in carbon nanocapsules and the related Li-S cathode properties	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							GRAPHENE OXIDE; POROUS CARBON; HIGH-CAPACITY; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; NANOTUBES; COMPOSITES; EFFICIENCY; BATTERIES	We studied the recrystallization behaviours of sulfur melt in oxygen-containing carbon nanocapsules (CNCs). The effects of the oxidizing degree and the nanoconfinement of CNCs on sulfur recrystallization were investigated. We performed weak oxidation on CNCs by firstly grafting >C-Cl-3 groups via a Friedel-Craft reaction and successive hydrolysis of >C-Cl-3; and the strong oxidation was conducted in nitric acid. It is found that the weak oxidation preserved the CNC structure while the strong oxidation damaged the CNC morphology. Electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy were combined to characterize the sulfur crystallites in pristine and oxidized CNCs. The results revealed that the smaller sulfur crystallites preferentially formed in integrated CNCs (preserved nanoscale hollow structure) regardless of oxygen content; while the stronger oxidation and destruction of hollow structures fostered the growth of larger sulfur crystals. These results suggest a possible approach to control the growth of sulfur in carbon by combining oxygen and nanoconfinement effects, and hopefully to tune the related electrochemical properties in Li-S battery cathodes.

The conductivity and electronegative sites of carbon materials will greatly affect the nucleation of Li metal. However, how much these two contributing factors affect the Li plating/stripping stability should be considered. This work presents N, O doped carbon nanofiber framework (CNF) membrane as the interlayer for protecting the Li anode. The amounts of N and O elements and their ratios, the conductivity, the thickness of CNF membrane and their effects on the Li plating/stripping process have been fully analyzed. The voltage profile and the stability of Li plating/stripping process are evaluated by symmetric and asymmetrical coin cells. The lithiophilic heteroatom doped surface mainly works as an excellent guide during the Li plating process, whereas the conductivity and mechanical stability of CNF equalize the current density and confine the volume change in during cycling. With the optimized CNF membrane as the interlayer, both Li metal and Li-S full cells exhibit good capacity properties and cyclic stability.

Herein, we synthesized 3D honeycomb-like Ni3S2@graphene oxide composite (3D honeycomb-like Ni3S2@GO) by a one-pot hydrothermal method. We found that positive charges of Ni2+ and negative charges of NO3- in Ni(NO3)(2) induced a transformation of graphene oxide with smooth surface into graphene oxide with wrinkled surface (w-GO). The w-GO in the mixing solution of Ni(NO3)(2)/thioacetamide/H2O evolved into 3D honeycomb-like Ni3S2@GO in solvothermal process. The GO effectively inhibited the aggregation of Ni3S2 nanoparticles. Photoelectrochemical cells based on 3D Ni3S2@GO synthesized at 60mMl(-1) Ni(NO3)(2) exhibited the best energy conversion efficiency. 3D Ni3S2@GO had smaller charge transfer resistance and larger exchange current density than pure Ni3S2 for iodine reduction reaction. The cyclic stability of 3D honeycomb-like Ni3S2@GO was good in the iodine electrolyte. Results are of great interest for fundamental research and practical applications of 3D GO and its composites in solar water-splitting, artificial photoelectrochemical cells, electrocatalysts and Li-S or Na-S batteries.

In the composite PCM, the graphene aerogel plays a role as a skeletal structure to seal the PW, and provides more pathways for thermal conduction. The CNTs perform as extended surface on the skeletal structure for a further improvement of the thermal conductivity. The prepared composite PCM with 2.2 wt% of HGA exhibits a thermal conductivity as high as 0.46 W m(-1) K-1, 1.77-fold higher than that of pure PW (0.26 W m(-1) K-1), and 1.44-fold higher than the PW/GA composite PCM. At the same time, the prepared composite PCM also possesses a large solar absorptance (close to 1) in the solar spectrum, which is 1.4-fold higher than that of pure PW. In addition, owing to the low density of HGA, the composite PCM reveals a comparable heat storage performance as compared to pure PW. In addition, the feasibility of composite PCMs in a solar thermal storage system is modelled and studied by numerical simulation. The results indicate that the numerical model could predict the solar thermal storage process accurately. The PW/G2C1-CA solar unglazed collector shows good performance in terms of large solar energy storage and short charging/discharging durations.

However, this still remains a challenge. New multicore closely packed ultrathin-MnO2@N-doped carbon-gear yolk-shell micro-nanostructures are explored as the S host material to trap polysulfides and enhance conductivity. Such composites can accommodate S mass-loading up to 80 wt% via a valid sulfur solution infiltration approach. The cooperation of ultrathin-MnO2 yolks with N-doped carbon internal gear shells can well suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect by strong chemical interactions and physical confinement as well as enhanced conductivity for excellent Li-S battery properties, which enable an initial gravimetric capacity of 1245 mA h g(-1) and a low decay rate of 0.03% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1C. In particular, the composite delivers an initial gravimetric capacity of 1097.8 mA h g(-1) and volumetric capacity of 1059.6 mA h cm(-3) at 2C rate. Specifically, the electrochemical performance of the designed composite at different electrolyte/S ratios is firstly investigated in this study, and is a promising approach with the high-performance cathode material for Li-S batteries.

Here, we report micro/nanostructure CoFe2O4 rods combining both catalytic sites (Co) and adsorption sites (Fe). Under the synergistic enhancement of these two different sites, the conversion rate of polysulfides in Li-S batteries is greatly accelerated, and the "shuttle effect" is effectively suppressed. When used as the host material for Li-S batteries, the capacity, rate performance and cycling stability are promoted greatly. Most importantly, the cell achieves an excellent electrochemical performance at high temperatures. After 1000 cycles, the Li-S battery using CoFe2O4 nanorods as the cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity of about 700 mA h g(-1) at a high temperature of 70 degrees C with a capacity attenuation of less than 0.02% per cycle. Meanwhile, the battery also shows excellent performance at -20 degrees C owing to the high catalytic activity.

Compared to graphene-based cathodes, metal dichalcogenide cathodes can potentially provide RAIBs with higher capacities. However, metal dichalcogenides suffer from poor cycling performance, hindering the further development of high-capacity RAIBs. Thus, to further improve the performance of RAIBs, it is imperative to gain a deep understanding of the mechanisms behind the energy-storage and capacity-deterioration characteristics of these materials. In this work, we conducted detailed characterization to acquire a deep understanding of the energy storage mechanism of a CoSe2-based cathode. The characterization results revealed that energy storage involved incorporation of Al3+ into CoSe2 to generate AlmConSe2 (i.e., partial substitution of Co2+ by Al3+) and elemental Co, while capacity deterioration resulted from the dissolution of active cobalt species into the electrolyte and the pulverization of the CoSe2 phase. The understanding of the capacity-deterioration mechanism allowed us to design a two-step concept for a new type of RAIB composite cathode material. Thus, we employed a conductive wrapping layer of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to protect CoSe2 /carbon nanodice composites from cobalt dissolution and CoSe2 pulverization while also improving the conductivity of the materials. This novel design resulted in a CoSe2/carbon nanodice@rGO composite material with an outstanding cycling performance (after 500 cycles) of 143 mA h g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1), which is one of the best performances for a metal-based RAIB cathode material reported to date. These findings are of great significance for the further development of high-capacity RAIBs.

Therefore, a separator with an ultralight modification layer plays an indispensable role to obtain LSBs with high specific capacity and high energy density. Herein, we report a novel modified separator with an ultrathin and lightweight MnO2 functional layer (500 nm, 0.1 mg cm(-2)), which was grown in situ on a Celgard-2400 separator (MnO2@PP) via a facile hydrothermal reaction. The MnO2@PP separator effectively suppressed the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and improved the redox process. In addition, the strong chemical affinity of MnO2 for LiPSs was also verified by first-principles calculations.

Herein, N-doped carbon sheets with cobalt compounds nanoparticles anchored on carbon cloth (CoP/NC or Co9S8/NC) are synthesized to act as sulfur host in Li-S batteries. The porous 2D N-doped carbon sheets uniformly grow on the surface of carbon cloth to form open porous structure, providing a mechanically robust space for the deposition of sulfur species and offering direct channels for fast Li+ diffusion. The cobalt compounds, serving as adsorbent to alleviate the shuttle effect of polysulfides by providing strong affinity and to accelerate the redox kinetics via their electrocatalytic effect toward the polysulfides conversion, are firmly and evenly embedded in the carbon sheets. Through comparison, the higher electrocatalytic effect of CoP/NC than Co9S8/NC are proved by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the symmetric cell with Li2S6 electrolyte as both negative and positive electrodes. Benefiting from the unique open structure, proper adsorption ability and superior catalytic effect of CoP/NC, it shows enhanced electrochemical performance, delivering high specific of 1482 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and 678 mAh g(-1) at 3C and outstanding cycling performance with capacity decay of only 0.0327% per cycle for over 560 cycles.

Herein, we present a multi-functional porous carbon, melamine cyanurate (MCA)-glucose-derived carbon (MGC), with superior porosity, electrical conductivity, and polysulfide affinity as an efficient sulfur support to mitigate the shuttle effect. MGC is prepared via a reactive templating approach, wherein the organic MCA crystals are utilized as the pore-/micro-structure-directing agent and nitrogen source. The homogeneous coating of spherical MCA crystal particles with glucose followed by carbonization at 600 degrees C leads to the formation of hierarchical porous hollow carbon spheres with abundant pyridinic N-functional groups without losing their microstructural ordering. Moreover, MGC enables facile penetration and intensive anchoring of LiPS, especially under high loading sulfur conditions. Consequently, the MGC cathode exhibited a high areal capacity of 5.79 mAh cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) and high loading sulfur of 6.0 mg cm(-2) with a minor capacity decay rate of 0.18% per cycle for 100 cycles.

J	Liu, JD; Zheng, YH				Liu, Jingdong; Zheng, Yuanhui			Dissolution and Reprecipitation of Sulfur on Carbon Surface	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Li-S battery; disproportionation reaction; reaction mechanism; lithium polysulfides	LITHIUM; SHUTTLE; CATHODE; MECHANISM; INSIGHT	A better understanding of the redox process of lithium polysulfide (LPS) on carbon surfaces is helpful for designing Li/S batteries with better performance. The "shuttle mechanism" can explain the low coulomb efficiency and self-discharge of a Li/S battery, but it cannot explain the fact that battery performance is strongly affected by electrolyte volume and sulfur load. This paper aims to reveal the main redox process of LPS on the surface of carbon by examining the cathodic behavior with different electrolyte volume and sulfur load. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and impedance spectra of the cathode before and after the first discharge were compared, and it was found that the discharge process is the continuous dissolution of sulfur composited with carbon into the electrolyte to form LPS. At the same time, LPS re-precipitates sulfur on the surface of the cathode through a disproportionation reaction to form a solid film. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves showed that the solid film passivates the electrode, and the electrode is activated only when the potential is swept negatively and Li2S is generated. When a lean electrolyte is used, there is fluctuation in the CV curves, which proves that the dissolution-reprecipitation of sulfur is the main process of the cathode. The discharge-charge curves of cathodes with different sulfur load were compared, and it was found that there is wavy fluctuation in the discharge curve when the sulfur load increases, which proves again that the sulfur reaction dominates the electrode process.

This work reports a spray-dried sulfur composite with large intrinsic internal pores, ensuring adequate local electrolyte availability. This material offers good performance with a electrolyte content of 7 mu L mg(-1) at high areal loadings (5-8 mg cm(-2)), while also offering the first reported 2.8 mu L mg(-1) (8 mg cm(-2)) to enter into the second plateau of discharge and continue to operate for 20 cycles. Moreover, evidence is provided that the high-frequency semicircle (i.e., interfacial resistance) is mainly responsible for the often observed bypassing of the second plateau in lean electrolyte discharges.

However, low capacity and short cyclic life are significant obstacles to their practical applications. Here, we demonstrate a highly reversible aqueous zinc-iodine battery using encapsulated iodine in microporous carbon as the cathode material by controlling solid-liquid conversion reactions. We identified the factors influencing solid-liquid conversion reactions, e.g., the pore size, surface chemistry of carbon host, and solvent effect. Rational manipulation of the competition between the adsorption in carbon and solvation in electrolytes for iodine species is responsible for the high reversibility and cyclic stability. The zinc-iodine battery delivers a high capacity of 174.4 mAh g(-1) at 1C, stable cyclic life over 3000 cycles with similar to 90% capacity retention, and negligible self discharge. We believe that the principles for stabilizing the zinc-iodine system could provide new insight for other conversion systems such as lithium-sulfur systems.

However, the shuttle effect of polyselenides in lithium-selenium batteries, similar to that of polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries, is still one of the main drawbacks. Here, we designed and synthesized a new pomegranate-like porous carbon/Se (PPC/Se) cathode that could effectively improve the shuttle effect of polyselenides. The pomegranate-like carbon nanoparticles used as the host materials for Se were prepared via carbonization of well-assembled ketjen black nanosubunits. The batteries assembled with such new-synthesized PPC/Se cathodes exhibit relatively high specific capacity of 380 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and high Coulombic efficiency of similar to 98% due to the restrained dissolution of polyselenides.

The architecture employed is representative of a wide number of electrochemically stable and rate-capable Se-based sodium metal battery (SMB) cathodes. SSNMR demonstrates that during the first sodiation, the Se chains are progressively cut to form an amorphous mixture of polyselenides of varying lengths, with no evidence for discrete phase transitions during sodiation. It also shows that Se nearest the carbon pore surface is sodiated first, leading to the formation of a core-shell compositional profile. HRTEM indicates that the vast majority of the pore-confined Se is amorphous, with the only localized presence of nanocrystalline equilibrium Na2Se2 (hcp) and Na2Se (fcc). A nanoscale fracture of terminally sodiated Na-Se is observed by HAADF, with SSNMR, indicating a physical separation of some Se from the carbon host after the first cycle. GITT reveals a 3-fold increase in Na+ diffusivity at cycle 2, which may be explained by the creation of extra interfaces. These combined findings highlight the complex phenomenology of electrochemical phase transformations in nanoconfined materials, which may profoundly differ from their "free" counterparts.

One notable challenge resides in preparing printable suspensions with superior dispersing ability and stability. Regarding the energy storage applications, graphene oxide (GO) inks have been extensively investigated to match the requirements for the DIW 3D printing technology, where the consecutive reduction process can lead to the targeted reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an electrically conductive host for SCs and batteries. In this review, we first analyze the scientific challenges and corresponding resolving strategies of the DIW-printed rGO electrodes. Then, we move to specific capacitor examples by discussing the current progress of Non-3D-printed interdigitated rGO-based SCs, DIW-printed interdigitated rGO-based SCs, and DIW-printed rGO-based aerogel SCs. Concerning the battery aspects, modern developments of DIW-printed rGO-based aerogel electrodes for different battery systems, including lithium-ion, lithium/sulfur, lithium/O-2, and lithium/CO2 batteries, are summed up. Of note, among these detailed examples, special attention has been paid to the interacting and combining manners between the DIW technique and rGO/electrode materials science. Finally, we prospect several distinct challenges and potential directions in this prosperous domain, which are devised for further exploitations of the DIW-printed rGO-based aerogels in energy storage devices.

In this research, a new complex emulsion type sizing agent containing polyetherimide (PEI) and covalently chemical functionalized graphene oxide (GO) was first proposed to further improve the interfacial adhesion of carbon fiber (CF)/PEI composites, adapt to the high processing temperature, and overcome the shortcomings of the solution type sizing agent. The emulsion was prepared by the emulsion/solvent evaporation method. In order to avoid the agglomeration of nanomaterials on CF surface, the monomer and polymer structure of PEI was used to functionalize GO, so as to achieve better compatibility and dispersion of GO in PEI. The physicochemical state of CF surface was characterized and the successful introduction of GO was verified. The microbond test revealed that the introduction of GO further improved the IFSS compared with only PEI sizing. When GO grafted with PEI was used as the main component of the sizing agent, the IFSS reached the largest with an increasement of 55.96%. The mechanism of interfacial reinforcement was proposed. Increased ability of mechanical interlocking, the mutual solubility between PEI molecular chains, and the improvement in wettability may be beneficial to the interfacial strength. This mild and effective modification method provided theoretical guidance for the interfacial enhancement of composites and was expected to be applied in industrial production.

However, two major roadblocks currently prevent industrial development of these kind of batteries: (i) the progressive dissolution of active material in the electrolyte which hinders cyclability of the devices and; (ii) the electrical insulating nature of organic or sulfur materials. In this work, we show an elegant solution to solve both, the conductivity and dissolution issues. We covalently functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) with electrochemically active thiolated molecules. The MWNTs insure a well distributed electronic conductivity inside the positive electrode and serve as a support for a covalent immobilization of the thiolated active species. Compared to electrodes formed by simply mixing carbon nanotubes with thiol-containing molecules, covalently functionalized MWNT materials present an excellent stability over prolonged cycling and a promising specific capacity, in the range of 100 mAhg(electrode)(-1), i.e., including carbon and current collector masses.

J	Wei, L; Liu, GL; Fan, DZ; Zhang, GY				Wei, Lin; Liu, Gui-Li; Fan, Da-Zhi; Zhang, Guo-Ying			Density functional theory study on the electronic structure and optical properties of S absorbed graphene	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						Graphene; Bending deformation; Electronic structure; Optical properties	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; TEMPERATURE; ADSORPTION; OXIDE	The effect of bend angle on the stability, electronic structure and optical properties of S absorbed graphene system is studied by using density functional theory based on the first - principles. Within the scope of the current study, it is found that the C atoms which are closest to the S atom are pulled up, the graphene plane is distorted, and the band gap of the graphene is opened, which changes graphene from quasi-metal to semiconductors. Bending deformation decreases the structural stability of S atom adsorbed on graphene system. The adsorption energy decreases with the increase of bending angle. After the intrinsic graphene is bent, the band gap is opened, and the bandgap increases with the bending angle. When the bending angle is between 0 degrees-20 degrees, it still corresponds to the quasi-metal property. When the bending angle increases to 25 degrees, it gradually changes from small bandgap semiconductor to medium bandgap semiconductor. The band gap of graphene adsorbed S atom system decreases with the increase of the bending angle, and it always corresponds to medium bandgap semiconductors. When the angle is increased to 30 degrees, the system loses its stability. The rate of increase of absorption coefficient increases with the increase of bending angle. The deformation causes the maximum absorption peak and the maximum reflection peak of the system to red shift, and the degree of red shift increases with the increase of the bending angle.

On one hand, the high-quality graphene, obtained via spontaneous electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in propylene-carbonate-based electrolyte, works as a matrix to improve the conductivity of sulfur and trap the polysulfides. On the other hand, the lithiated graphite anode, obtained by spontaneous electrochemical lithiation of graphite in ethylene-carbonate-based electrolyte with 5 wt % fluoroethylene-carbonate additive, provides ample lithium ion sources and increases the safety coefficient of the lithium ion sulfur battery. Meanwhile, the fluoroethylene-carbonate additive can derive a LiF-rich solid electrolyte interphase on a lithiated graphite anode, which can in turn mitigate the notorious "shuttle effect". More attractively, the spontaneous electrochemical exfoliation and lithiation method can produce high-quality graphene and lithiated graphite in large scale and without electric energy consumption. Therefore, this approach shows great potential for the configuration of an advanced lithium ion sulfur battery with enhanced safety and high energy density.

The sublimation temperatures of sulfur molecules encapsulated in MPC and the two kinds of SWCNTs were measured by thermo-gravimetric measurements. It was found that the sublimation temperature of sulfur molecules encapsulated in SWCNTs having mean tube diameter of 1.5 nm is much higher than any other molecules encapsulated in larger pores. It was also found that the capacity fading of lithium-sulfur battery can be diminished by encapsulation of sulfur molecules in SWCNTs. We also investigated the electrochemical properties of phosphorus molecules encapsulated in SWCNTs (P@SWCNTs). It was shown that P@SWCNT can adsorb and desorb both Li and Na ions reversibly.

However, the brittleness and poor controllability limited its application in resin to form conducting pathways for phonons and electrons. This study developed a facile method with compressible and constitutionally stable commercial melamine foam (MF) as template to prepare a core-shell composite with carbon skeleton structure. The core carbon structure was fabricated by carbonization of MF, while the shell carbon structure was the in-situ self-assembled coating of graphene. Vacuum-impregnated method was employed to fabricate epoxy resin composites. The thermal and electrical conductivities of epoxy composites were significantly increased to 0.92 W/(m.K) and 0.70 S/cm, which was 318% and 13 orders of magnitude higher than that of pure epoxy. Herein, we provide a highly efficient, green, high-quality method for building a double-layer heat conduction path, which facilitates the utilization of graphene. The proposed method proves to be efficient in enhancing the multifunctionality of epoxy resin composites. Furthermore, we explored the thermal and electrical conductive mechanisms of the three-dimensional core-shell structure in resin matrix.

The intertwined 1D nanospindles and enriched-oxygen doping of the HPC was obtained after one-step carbonization of the MOC. When employed in lithium-ion batteries, the HPC exhibited reversible capacity of 778mAhg(-1) after 60cycles at 50mAg(-1). Moreover, the HPC maintained a capacity of 188mAhg(-1) after 400cycles at 100mAg(-1) as the anode material in a sodium-ion battery. In addition, the HPC served as the cathode matrix for evaluation of a lithium-sulfur battery. The general preparation process of the HPC is commercial, which is responsible for the large-scale production for its practical application.

Highly innovative efforts are invested to demonstrate promising Li-S cells at laboratory scales. In order to promote this battery technology further, it is important to develop and test sulfur cathodes with practically high loading per unit area. The work described herein is devoted to long-term testing of Li-S and Si-Li-S cells comprising electrodes with high loading of the active mass, in pouch cells. This study investigates composite cathodes in which sulfur is embedded in matrices of multiwall carbon nanotubes and composite anodes based on prelithiated Si/SiOx nanospheres. These full-cells exhibit stable cycling performance for more than 400 cycles, substantially more than equivalent cells utilizing metallic lithium anodes, which suffer from dendritic Li growth. The use of pouch cells, high cathodes' loading, and relatively high charge exchange per unit area during each cycle, emphasize the limitation of Li metal anodes in rechargeable batteries and promote development of Si-Li-S batteries for prolonged cycle life.

J	Yao, YX; Ren, LL; Gao, ST; Li, S				Yao, Yaxuan; Ren, Lingling; Gao, Sitian; Li, Shi			Histogram method for reliable thickness measurements of graphene films using atomic force microscopy (AFM)	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Graphene; Thickness measurement; Atomic force microscopy; Histogram method	FEW-LAYER GRAPHENE; SHEETS	Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a commonly used technique for graphene thickness measurement. However, due to surface roughness caused by graphene itself and variation introduced in AFM measurement, graphene thickness is difficult to be accurately determined by AFM. In this paper, a histogram method was used for reliable measurements of graphene thickness using AFM. The influences of various measurement parameters in AFM analysis were investigated. The experimental results indicate that significant deviation can be introduced using various order of flatten and improperly selected measurement parameters including amplitude setpoint and drive amplitude. At amplitude setpoint of 100 mV and drive amplitude of 100 mV, thickness of 1 layer (1L), 2 layers (2L) and 4 layers (4L) graphene were measured. The height differences for 1L, 2L and 4L were 1.51 +/- 0.16 nm, 1.92 +/- 0.13 nm and 2.73 +/- 0.10 nm, respectively.

Here we report a hollow carbon nanofiber-encapsulated sulfur cathode for effective trapping of polysulfides and demonstrate experimentally high specific capacity and excellent electrochemical cycling of the cells. The hollow carbon nanofiber arrays were fabricated using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates, through thermal carbonization of polystyrene. The AAO template also facilitates sulfur infusion into the hollow fibers and prevents sulfur from coating onto the exterior carbon wall. The high aspect ratio of the carbon nanofibers provides an ideal structure for trapping polysulfides, and the thin carbon wall allows rapid transport of lithium ions. The small dimension of these nanofibers provides a large surface area per unit mass for Li2S deposition during cycling and reduces pulverization of electrode materials due to volumetric expansion. A high specific capacity of about 730 mAh/g was observed at C/5 rate after 150 cycles of charge/discharge. The introduction of LiNO3 additive to the electrolyte was shown to improve the Coulombic efficiency to over 99% at C/5. The results show that the hollow carbon nanofiber-encapsulated sulfur structure could be a promising cathode design for rechargeable Li/S batteries with high specific energy.

The products are composed of multi-layers of C/S flakes, with predominantly amorphous and some graphene-like structures. Covalent bonding between C and S is observed in the nanolaminates, which render the latter promising candidates as electrode materials for Li-S batteries. We also show that it is possible to extract Ti from other MAX phases, such as Ti3AlC2, Ti3SnC2, and Ti2GeC, suggesting that electrochemical etching can be a powerful method to selectively extract the M elements from the MAX phases, to produce AX layered structures, that cannot be made otherwise.

The obtained HCSs are generally amorphous or weakly graphitized (with the help of graphitization catalysts). In this work, we report on the fabrication of graphitized HCSs and yolk-shell Au@HCS nanostructures using a modified templating method, in which smooth, uniform graphene layers were grown on SiO2 spheres or Au@SiO2 nanoparticles via metal-catalyst-free chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of methane. Our work not only provides a new method to fabricate high-quality, graphitized HCSs but also demonstrates a reliable approach to grow quality graphene on oxide surfaces using CVD without the presence of metal catalysts.

Single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) are considered to have more excellent properties compared with multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs), however, how to appropriately use SWCNTs as building blocks for nanocomposite electrodes is not well understood. Here, a composite cathode containing SWCNT@S coaxial nanocables for Li-S battery is fabricated by a facile melt-diffusion strategy. Beneficial from its sp2 carbon nanostructure, higher specific surface area, larger aspect ratio, and interconnected electron pathway, the SWCNT@S cathode have reversible capacities of 676, 441 and 311 mAh g1 for the first discharging at 0.5 C, 100th discharging at 1.0 C, and discharging at 10.0 C, respectively. These capacities are much higher than the corresponding capacities of the MWCNT@S cathode. By introducing polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a physical barrier to trap the highly polar polysulfide species, the PEG modified SWCNT@S cathode afforded improved reversible capacities. The cycling stability of the reversible capacities is expected to be further improved. The SWCNTs can serve as scaffolds for Li-S battery with much improved energy storage performance.

Our results indicated that nitrogen-doped carbon black significantly improved the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode materials. Synchrotron-based XPS revealed that the defect sites of nitrogen-doped carbon are favorable for the discharge product deposition, leading to a high utilization and reversibility of sulfur cathodes. Our studies also found that the introduction of oxygen functional groups results in deteriorated performance of Li-sulfur batteries due to the reduced conductivity and unwanted side reactions occurring between sulfur and surface oxygen species.

X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical testing methods were conducted to investigate the effect of reduction of the graphene oxide gel on the Li-S battery electrochemical performance. The results indicated that the reduced graphene oxide gel was a 3D network graphite structure. The sulfur-based composite material was uniformly embedded, and sulfur polymer loss was suppressed. The reduction degree of graphene oxide (GO) gel increased with increasing water fluid temperatures. In contrast, when the water fluid temperature was 190 degrees C, the best rate performance of the electrode was observed.

However, intermediates of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) can easily shuttle to the Li anode and react with Li metal to deplete the active materials and cause rapid failure of the battery. A facile solution pretreatment method for Li anodes involving a solution of metal fluorides/dimethylsulfoxide was developed to construct robust biphasic surface layers (BSLs) in situ. The BSLs consist of lithiophilic alloy (LixM) and LiF phases on Li metal, which inhibit the shuttle effect and increase the cycle life of Li-S batteries. The BSLs allow Li+ transport and they inhibit dendrite growth and shield the Li anodes from corrosive reaction with LiPSs. Li-S batteries containing BSLs-Li anodes demonstrate excellent cycling over 1000 cycles at 1 C and simultaneously maintain a high coulombic efficiency of 98.2 %. Based on our experimental and theoretical results, we propose a strategy for inhibition of the shuttle effect that produces high stability Li-S batteries.

Here, a unique synchronous synthesis method is established that can simultaneously construct Li2S encapsulated in conductive protective layers, and accordingly propose a coordination effect of catalysis and domain restriction for Li2S cathodes. Typically, based on the lithiothermic reaction of 8Li + MoS2 + CS2 = 4Li(2)S + Mo + C, the obtained composite features abundant Mo nanocrystals embedded in crystalline Li2S matrices and then wrapped by few-layer graphene. Notably, all three components derived from lithiothermic reaction are linked by the chemical bonding of Mo-S and C-S, forming a compact Mo-Li2S-graphene triple heterostructure. Systematic studies reveal an unprecedented relevancy between charge overpotential and catalytic activation of Mo-Li2S-graphene, whereas a low activation potential of 2.43 V is achieved. Further studies disclose the relationship between cycle stability and confinement effect of core-shell structure, whereas the improved confinement efficiency for polysulfides enables an excellent cycle life for the Li-S battery. Moreover, the Mo-Li2S-graphene cathode demonstrates promising application for LIB, where the Mo-Li2S-graphene//Si-C battery shows a high capacity of 764 mAh g(-1) and outstanding cycle stability.

However, the dissolution of selenium in electrolytes results in low selenium utilization, concentration polarization, inferior capacities, and unstable cycling performances. Herein, 46.58 wt% of selenium is loaded on carbon cloths through the calcination process, which were directly used as self-supporting cathodes. Carbonized polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber membranes produced by electrospinning are worn as the protective clothing between the cathode and separator to avoid the loss and dissolution of selenium. The stabilization of Li-Se batteries was enhanced by introducing two interlayers, as expected, they exhibit a stable reversible average capacity of 590 mA h g(-1) during 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C (1 C = 675 mA g(-1)). No polyselenide formation is found during charging/discharging, and the effects of the introduced PAN interlayers on improving the stability and reducing the polarization of the assembled Li-Se batteries are confirmed by mechanistic characterizations. These regulated Li-Se batteries present great application potential in the future, and the design idea can also be promoted to explore other energy storage systems.

However, the widely used melt-diffusion method is suffering from nonuniform distribution of sulfur, agglomeration of cathode materials and uncontrollable sulfur contents, especially in large scale preparation process. In this work, a simple one step spray drying method to prepare sulfur uniformly distributed cathode materials in kilogram-scale is provided. A faster Li+ diffusion pathway is constructed benefit by the uniform distribution of sulfur in spay drying derived samples, which results in high Li+ diffusion coefficient, high sulfur utilization and good electrochemical performance. Density function theory calculation has proved that adding of TiN nano powder increased the polysulfides adsorption capacity and enhanced the cycling stability. The spray drying derived S/T/CNTs-70 cathode materials revealed an initial discharge capacity of 1465 mA h g at 0.1 C. The capacity decayed to 1200 mA h(-1) g at 0.3 C and maintained at 842 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. Furthermore, a Li-S pouch cell with a nominal capacity of 2 A h(-1) was fabricated using S/T/CNTs-70 as cathode. 31 paralleled light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are lighted sustainably by the Li-S pouch cell, which affirmed the practical value of the one step spray drying method.

However, the low conductivity of sulfur and Li2S/Li2S2, as well as the dissolution and shuttling of intermediate lithium polysulfides, is a great challenge for high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, interconnected NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays grown on carbon cloth (CC) are applied as the cathode (S/NiCo2O4/CC) in Li-S batteries for accommodating sulfur. The obtained cathode shows high conductivity, high dispersion of sulfur species and excellent polysulfide adsorption and catalytic properties. As a result, significantly higher specific capacity (1480 vs. 1048 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C) and greatly enhanced rate performance (624 vs. 215 mA h g(-1) at 2C) are obtained for the S/NiCo2O4/CC cathode in comparison to S/CC. Further, the S/NiCo2O4/CC cathode demonstrates a low capacity decay of 0.060% per cycle over 400 cycles at 0.5C.

In the present study, the impact of using a polyelectrolyte binder (poly(diallyldimethylammonium) bis(trifluromethane sulfonyl)imide) on the morphological degradation of sulfur electrodes is evaluated by in situ dilatometry, acoustic emission (AE) and synchrotron X-ray tomography (XRT), and compared to more conventional binders (poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)). The dilatometry study shows that during the initial sulfur dissolution process, the polyelectrolyte-based electrode displays a lower irreversible thickness contraction of similar to 16% compared to similar to 22% and similar to 31% for CMC and PVdF, respectively. This is confirmed by the XRT measurements showing a reduced thickness variation for the polyelectrolyte electrode compared to the CMC electrode. The same trend is found in the AE results, where a lower acoustic activity attributed to the rupture of the binder/carbon/sulfur network is detected during the 1st discharge plateau for the polyelectrolyte electrode. All these results confirm the major role of the binder for the Li/S system. Thanks to its multifunctionality, it impacts both the diffusion of the active material outside the electrode and the electrode integrity and therefore the conduction paths and accessible active surface for electrochemical processes.

To develop a high-performance cathode for LSBs, encapsulation of polysulfides with a blocking layer is potentially straightforward. Herein, a novel strategy is reported encapsulate sulfur and the electrolyte together in porous carbon spheres by using a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) that can selectively sieve Li+ ions while efficiently avoiding polysulfide accumulation and suppressing undesired polysulfide migration. This strategy is simple, straightforward, and effective. The carbon/sulfur cathode only needs to be cycled a few times within a voltage window of 0.3-1.0 V to form such a smart SEI, allowing the resulting cathode to exhibit superior stability extending 600 cycles. This strategy can be combined with other existing advanced sulfur cathode designs to improve the overall performance of LSBs.

J	Xu, XB; Ruan, JF; Pang, YP; Yuan, T; Zheng, SY				Xu, Xinbo; Ruan, Jiafeng; Pang, Yuepeng; Yuan, Tao; Zheng, Shiyou			Sulfur encapsulated in thermally reduced graphite oxide as a cathode for Li-S batteries	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							GRAPHENE OXIDE; RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES; ION BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; INTERLAYER; COMPOSITE; POLYSULFIDE; NANOTUBES	Rechargeable Li-S batteries are receiving ever-increasing attention due to their high theoretical energy density and inexpensive raw sulfur materials. However, their practical applications have been hindered by short cycle life and limited power density owing to the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur species, diffusion of soluble polysulfide intermediates (Li2Sn, n = 4-8) and the large volume change of the S cathode during charge/discharge. Optimizing the carbon framework is considered as an effective approach for constructing high performance S/carbon cathodes because the microstructure of the carbon host plays an important role in stabilizing S and restricting the "shuttle reaction" of polysulfides in Li-S batteries. In this work, reduced graphite oxide (rGO) materials with different oxidation degree were investigated as the matrix to load the active material by an in situ thermally reducing graphite oxide (GO) and intercalation strategy under vacuum at 600 degrees C. It has been found that the loaded amount of S embedded in the rGO layer for the S/carbon cathode and its electrochemical performance strongly depended on the oxidation degree of GO. In particular, on undergoing CS2 treatment, the rGO-S cathode exhibits extraordinary performances in Li-S batteries. For instance, at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1), the optimized rGO-S cathode shows a columbic efficiency close to 100% and retains a capacity of around 750 mA h g(-1) with progressive cycling up to over 250 cycles.

J	Huang, JQ; Chong, WG; Zhang, B; Ma, XY				Huang, Jian-Qiu; Chong, Woon Gie; Zhang, Biao; Ma, Xinyue			Advances in multi-functional flexible interlayers for Li-S batteries and metal-based batteries	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Flexible interlayer; Synthesis strategy; Rechargeable battery; Function mechanism	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; DOPED CARBON NANOFIBERS; FUNCTIONAL INTERLAYER; COULOMBIC EFFICIENCY; CYCLE PERFORMANCE; CATHODE MATERIALS; RATIONAL DESIGN; RECHARGEABLE LI; GRAPHENE OXIDE; HIGH-CAPACITY	In the last two decades, tremendous attention has been devoted to the development of novel electrodes for boosting the electrochemical performance of batteries. Despite the high energy densities, the novel battery systems, such as Li-S batteries, have encountered several issues that cannot be overcome by the electrode design alone. Therefore, a multi-functional freestanding film is inserted between the anode and cathode, which is normally named as "interlayer", to enhance the electrochemical performance. Thanks to the wide selection of materials, various straightforward, flexible films with controllable physical and chemical properties are rapidly developed and employed as interlayer in rechargeable batteries. This review introduces the design strategies for producing interlayers and describes the essential roles of interlayers in polysulfide adsorption for Li-S batteries and anode protection for alkali-metal batteries and multivalent-ion batteries. Exceptional functionalities of interlayers in providing polysulfide adsorption through physical interaction, H-bond interaction, and chemical interaction in Li-S batteries are summarized. The ameliorating effect of interlayers on metal batteries in suppressing the formation and growth of anode dendrites via mechanically barricading the continuous growth of dendrite, lowering local current density of anodes, reducing the overpotential of nucleation, and offering active sites for uniform ion deposition are reviewed. Recent advances of interlayers on structural design, component optimization, and function mechanism are critically assessed to elucidate the fundamental understandings in various rechargeable battery systems. Potential opportunities of interlayers for novel energy storage applications are revealed to offer new insights towards the development of advanced batteries.

Thus, many studies have been dedicated to promoting the conversion process by including either functionalized matrix materials in the cathode or redox mediators in the electrolyte. Herein, by embedding a solid auxiliary redox species, we designed and prepared a composite that can be used as a matrix for a sulfur cathode. Differing from the conventional method, in which all the so-called redox mediators utilized are dissolved in the electrolyte, we employed a solid auxiliary redox species, a cobalt phthalocyanine complex supported on graphene structures, as skeleton materials of sulfur to promote the conversion kinetics in Li-S batteries. The graphene-cobalt phthalocyanine hybrid played a prominent role in promoting the kinetics of polysulfide conversion with multiple functions of reducing the activation energy hill, transferring electrons, suppressing the shuttle effect,etc.Consequently, the Li-S battery with the graphene-cobalt phthalocyanine-sulfur cathode showed better electrochemical performance than the battery with the graphene-sulfur cathode. Typically, a high initial capacity of 1400 mA h g(-1)was achieved at 0.1C during the initial activation cycle, and the 1(st)and 300(th)cycle capacities at 0.5C were 1116 and 860 mA h g(-1), respectively. Additionally, at a rate of 0.3C, high capacities of 1182 and 869 mA h g(-1)were obtained during the 1(st)and 500(th)cycles, respectively. Furthermore, enhanced rate capability was achieved, delivering a capacity of 874 mA h g(-1)at a rate of 2C.

As a congener of sulfur (S), Se has a similar lithiation mechanism to S in charge/discharge when used as the cathode material of a Li-Se battery. However, similar to the Li-S battery, the Li-Se battery suffers from a shuttle effect that leads to poor cycle performance and low Coulombic efficiency. This review summarizes recent developments, highlights the excellent performance of Li-Se batteries and focuses on improvements to the carbon/Se composite electrode. The main obstacles are also discussed. The use of porous carbons, especially graphene-based materials, for improving the performance of the Se electrode in high performance Li-Se batteries is highlighted and discussed.

The structure and composition of the silver hexacyanoferrate was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Catalysis of the modified material to the electrochemical reaction of UA and DA were verified by cyclic amperometry method. Experiments show that both UA and DA have excellent linear response on the modified electrode in acetic acid buffer solution by chronoamperometry measurements. The sensitivity is 0.102 mu A/mu M in linear range of 2-80 mu M UA with a detection limit of 0.07 mu M and the sensitivity DA is 0.133 mu A/mu M in the range of 0.4-28 mu M DA with a detection limit of 0.03 mu M.

Therefore, exploring lithium rich-alloy (or compound) anodes and suppressing the shuttling of polysulfides have become practical technical challenges for the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries. Here, a lithium ion sulfur full battery system combining a lithium-rich Li-Si alloy anode and sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (S@pPAN) cathode has been proposed. The free-standing CNF matrix supported Li-Si alloy anode is prepared by a simple and effective method, which is practical for scale-up production. The obtained Li-Si alloy anode demonstrates high cycling stability without dendrite growth, while the use of the S@pPAN cathode avoids the shuttle effect in carbonate electrolytes. The constructed Li-Si/S@pPAN battery could be cycled more than 1000 times at 1C and 3000 times at 3C, with a capacity fading rate of 0.01% and 0.03% per cycle. The exceptional performance should originate from the stable integrated anode structure and the excellent compatibility of the S@pPAN cathode and Li-Si alloy anode with carbonate electrolytes.

Then, the nitrogen-doped composites (NCNT/S) were coated outside by PEG. The structure and morphology of NCNT/S were detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that the nitrogen atoms are effectively doped in carbon nanotubes by the high-temperature annealing method, and the carbon nanotube also maintains the intrinsic morphology and structure. Electrochemical test results indicate that the conductive properties of composite materials are enhanced by N-doping. The initial discharge capacity reaches 882.5 mAh(.)g(-1), and it keeps at 89.46% after 90 cycles. It is further enhanced by PEG-coating, and the initial discharge capacity increases to 1109.7 mAh(.)g(-1), and the discharge capacity retention ratio is 995.2 mAh(.)g(-1) after 90 cycles. The N-doping and PEG-coating can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of the CNT/S composite materials.

However, when used as the cathode, a high charging voltage (similar to 4 V versus Li+/Li) is always necessary to activate Li2S in the first charge process, and the voltage profile becomes similar to that of a common sulfur electrode in the following charge processes. In this report, we have prepared an electrode of nanosphere Li2S particles and investigated its charging mechanism of the initial two charge processes by in situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results indicate that Li2S is directly converted to elemental sulfur through a two-phase transformation in the first charge process, while it is oxidized first to polysulfides and then to sulfur in the second charge process. The origin of the different charging mechanisms and corresponding charge-voltage profiles of the first and second charge processes is found to be related to the remaining polysulfides at the end of the first discharge process: they can not only facilitate the charge-transfer process at the Li2S/electrolyte interface but also chemically react with Li2S and act as the polysulfide facilitator for the electrochemical oxidation of Li2S in the following charge processes. Our present study provides a new fundamental understanding of the charging mechanism of the Li2S electrode, which should be of help for the further development of high-performance Li/S cells.

The cell testing results indicate that increasing the TPE ratio led to both a higher discharge capacity and a higher Coulombic efficiency. The Li electrodes from the Li/Li symmetric cells showed that the one in higher TPE-content electrolyte has a smoother and more continuous SEI layer. AIMD simulation revealed the solvation structure of DOL/TPE - lithium polysulfide changes when the TPE concentration increases, which dictates the lithium polysulfide solubility in such electrolyte. These results shed light on the underpinned mechanism of the improved Coulombic efficiency and cycling performance of the Li-S cell. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

Herein, four deoxynucleotides (DNs), including A (adenine-DN), T (thymine-DN), G (guanine-DN), and C (cytosine-DN), which own rich polysulfide affinitive groups, are selected to model the anchoring environments of polysulfides. Using the most soluble Li2S8 as probe, our first-principles simulations suggest that the interactions between polysulfides and substrates are highly correlated to the charges of affinitive sites, H-bonding environments and structural tension. The contributions from each type of interactions are quasi-quantitatively assessed. The electrostatic attractions between Li+ and the strong electron lone-pairs dominate the adsorption energetics, while the H-bonds formed between S-8(2-) and substrate give rise to excessive stabilization. In contrast, structural distortion or rearrangement of the substrates is detrimental to the anchoring strengths. The quasi-quantitative resolution on the different interaction modes provides a facile and rational scheme for screening more efficient polysufide affinitive additives to sustain the cathode cyclicity of Li/S batteries.

While there is great perspective in terms of superior theoretical specific capacity and energy density great challenges have to be addressed. One major challenge, severely limiting cycle performance and capacity retention, is the shuttling of polysulphide species. In this contribution we show a reconfiguration of the usual Li-S cell. Instead of generating a carbon/sulphur composite by melt infiltration a highly porous, conductive nitrogen-rich carbon material (TNC) is coated onto a commercial polypropylene separator foil. The thin conductive coating of TNC on the separator enables the application of very simple sulphur/carbon black cathodes. Because the melt infiltration of sulphur in a porous host material becomes unnecessary the electrode processing is significantly simplified. The specific capacity and cycling stability of reconfigurated cells are both improved significantly compared to the performance of a standard cell setup using a pristine separator. At a constant charging rate of C/5 cells with modified separator showed 2.5 times higher residual capacity (1016 mAh g(-1)) than cells with pristine separator (405 mAh g(-1)). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, low-cost, hierarchically porous, and nitrogen-doped loofah sponge carbon (N-LSC) derived from the loofah sponge has been synthesized via a simple calcining process and then applied as a multifunctional blocking layer for Li-S, Li-Se, and Li-I-2 batteries. As a result of the ultrahigh specific area (2551.06 m(2) g(-1)), high porosity (1.75 cm(3) g(-1)), high conductivity (1170 S m(-1)), and heteroatoms doping of N-LSC, the resultant Li-S, Li-Se, and Li-I-2 batteries with the N-LSC-900 membrane deliver outstanding electrochemical performance stability in all cases, i.e., high reversible capacities of 623.6 mA h g(-1) at 1675 mA g(-1) after 500 cycles, 350 mA h g(-1) at 1356 mA g(-1) after 1000 cycles, and 150 mA h g(-1) at 10550 mA g(-1) after 5000 cycles, respectively. The successful application to Li-S, Li-Se, and Li-I-2 batteries suggests that loofah sponge carbon could play a vital role in modem rechargeable battery industries as a universal, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and high-performance blocking layer.

However, when the ether-based electrolytes are employed, Li-S/Se battery systems still have several inevitable drawbacks inhibiting their practical applications, such as intermediate product dissolution issues, and a dependency on a high content of electrolyte. Thus, it is urgent to pay attention to the electrochemical properties of SexSy cathodes in carbonate-based electrolytes, which may avoid the above mentioned problems. In this work, a series of mesoporous carbon/SexSy (CMK-3/SexSy) composites with covalent Se-S bonds and different Se/S molar ratios are prepared and their working mechanism in carbonate-based electrolytes is systematically investigated by combining experimental analysis and theoretical calculations. This work finds that the Se in the CMK-3/SexSy cathode is beneficial for the transportation of Li+ ions and forms a thin cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) during the discharge-charge process. Furthermore, S substitution in Se-8 molecules can enhance the specific capacity and lower the bond breaking and lithiation energies. The optimal CMK-3/SexSy cathode delivers outstanding performance with a high reversible capacity of 609 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) over 300 cycles	[He, Bin; Liu, Dongdong; Cheng, Zexiao; Miao, Ziyun; Rao, Zhixiang; Zhang, Huangwei; Yuan, Lixia; Li, Zhen; Huang, Yunhui] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Mat Proc & Die & Mold Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China		Li, Z; Huang, YH (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Mat Proc & Die & Mold Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.	li_zhen@hust.edu.cn; huangyh@bhust.edu.cn			Natural Science Foundation of China [51972131]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M662605]	Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)	The authors thank the financial supports of the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51972131) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M662605).		70	3	3	48	73	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1614-6832	1614-6840		ADV ENERGY MATER	Adv.

In an attempt to enhance the electric conductivity, the S/DPAN composite is attached on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets via self-assembling modification. As a result, the conductivity improves to similar to 10(-4) S cm(-1), and the S/DPAN/rGO composite thereby delivers approximately 90% of the theoretical capacity of sulphur at a rate of 0.2C (0.34 A g(-1)) over 700 mAh (g-S)(-1) even at 2C (3.4 A g(-1)). We first report on the C-S bond between sulphur and DPAN in a composite that maintains the bond even after an extensive cycling test, as confirmed by time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). These synergistic effects enable facile electron transport such that the S/DPAN/rGO composite electrode is able to maintain superior electrode performances. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In addition to providing excellent protection for lithium metal anodes by forming the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), the electrolyte promotes the formation of a crystalline cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) on the SPAN surface composed of LiF and LiNO2. The CEI effectively prevents the formation of soluble polysulfide species and enables stable cycling of the Li-SPAN battery. The benefit of having effective CEI and SEI layers is also demonstrated in Li-SPAN cells with limited lithium supply, which exhibit lithium cycling efficiency values consistent with or exceeding Li/Cu test results, reaching 99.5%. The development of electrolyte chemistries to enable the formation of effective CEI layers is a promising approach to long-life lithium metal batteries.

However, the practical applications of these batteries are hindered by their low electronic conductivity and short cycling lifetime. Herein, we present a simple and efficient strategy for improving the performance of Li-S batteries, utilizing excimer ultraviolet radiation to produce a functional C nanofiber (EUV-CNF) interlayer. In the presence of water and oxygen, the above irradiation results in the formation of oxygenated functional groups (e.g., OH and C=O) and nanopores on the interlayer surface. Compared to the sulfur cathode with a pristine C nanofiber (CNF) interlayer, that with the EUV-CNF interlayer exhibits a higher capacity of 917 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C and a lower average capacity fading per cycle (0.16%). This excellent cycling performance is attributed to the functionalization of the CNF interlayer, which not only improves cathode conductivity but also allows effective trapping of polysulfides within the cathode without hampering Li-ion conductivity. Thus, this work presents a simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly approach to improving the performance of Li-S batteries and thus paves the way to expanding their application scope.

Unfortunately, the issues caused by Li dendrites limit the commercialization of the batteries based on Li metal anodes. Research in recent years has proved that the Li dendrites cannot be completely eliminated. Inspired by the Chinese legend, "King Yu Tamed the Flood," the new strategy of combing dredge and block, to control the diversion of Li ions is proposed. Via Au modification on one side of the carbon fibers matrix (CFs@Au), selective deposition of Li ions on the back side of the current collector is successfully achieved. This is distant from the separator, and hence improves the safety effectively. As a result, the Coulombic efficiency of the CFs@Au-Li anode remains 99.2% throughout 400 cycles. What is more, the Li-S full cell paired with the composite anode also exhibits outstanding performance, even with limited Li. This backside-deposition strategy provides new insight into safe Li metal anode design for high energy density battery systems such as Li-S and Li-O-2.

However they suffer from an internal redox shuttle process which limit their capacity because the sulfur reduction products, LixSy species, cannot be fully re-oxidized. In order to overcome this problem, lithium nitrate is commonly used as an additive to the electrolyte solution, suppressing the shuttle phenomena in Li-sulfur batteries. We rigorously studied the electrochemical behavior of LiNO3 in electrolyte solutions and with electrodes relevant to Li-S cells. EQCM UV-Vis and XPS spectroscopies were used in conjunction with standard electrochemical measurements, in order to determine the stability limits of this additive. An irreversible reduction of the nitrate species occurs in Li-S cells resulting in a precipitation of electrolyte solutions decomposition products such as LiF and oxygen-containing polymeric species formed by reactions of the ethereal solutions due to nitrate reduction on the cathode side below 1.9 V vs. Li. We showed that both the reversible capacity and the voltage profile of Li-S cells are significantly improved when the limiting cutoff potentials for the sulfur cathodes is set above the red-ox potential of LiNO3.

Electrochemical performance of plasticized PEO-LiTf complex-based composite gel polymer electrolytes with the addition of barium titanate	IONICS			English	Article						Polymer-matrix composites; Transport properties; Thermogravimetric analysis; Casting; Interfacial properties; Lithium-sulfur batteries	IONIC-CONDUCTIVITY; LITHIUM BATTERIES; SOLVENT-FREE; NANOCOMPOSITE; MEMBRANES; PVC/PMMA; SULFUR; NANOPARTICLES; CARBONATE; CATHODE	Gel electrolytes and solid electrolytes have been reported as a potential element to slow down the polysulfide shuttle by reducing its mobility in the electrolytes. The preparation of sulfur-conductive polymer composites, or sulfur-carbon composites, has been reported as softening the impact of the shuttle effects. Unlike Li-ion batteries so far, no electrolyte is found to be optimal for Li-S batteries at all conditions. Taking into account all these factors, in the present study, an attempt has been made to develop solid polymer electrolytes in conjunction with non-aqueous liquid electrolytes along with inert fillers for Li-S batteries. Poly-ethylene oxide (PEO)-based composite gel polymer electrolytes (CGPE) comprising a combination of plasticizers, namely 1,3-dioxolane (DIOX)/tetraethylene glycol dimethylether (TEGDME) and a lithium salt (LiTf) with the addition of ceramic filler, barium titanate (BaTiO3) have been prepared using a simple solution casting technique in an argon atmosphere. The as-prepared polymer electrolyte films were subjected to SEM, ionic conductivity, TG/DTA, and FTIR analyses. A symmetric cell composed of Li/CGPE/Li was assembled, and the variation of interfacial resistance as a function of time was also measured. The ionic conductivity was found to be increased as a function of temperature. The lithium transference number (Li-t (+)) was measured, and the value was calculated as 0.7 which is sufficient for battery applications. The electrochemical stability window of the sample was studied by linear sweep voltammetry, and the polymer electrolyte film was found to be stable up to 5.7 V. The TG/DTA analysis reveals that this CGPE is thermally stable up to 350 A degrees C. The compatibility studies exhibited that CGPE has better interracial properties with lithium metal anode. The interaction between the PEO and salt has been identified by an FTIR analysis.	[Nagajothi, A.

However inferior results in ether electrolytes suggest that high solubility of Li2Sn (n <= 4) trumps the limited redox conversion, leading to dissolution and shuttling. Here, we introduce a small amount of selenium in sulfurized polyacrylonitrile to accelerate the redox conversion, delivering excellent performance in both carbonate and ether electrolytes, including high reversible capacity (1300 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)), 84% active material utilization and high rate (capacity up to 900 mA h g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)). These cathodes can undergo 800 cycles with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency and ultralow 0.029% capacity decay per cycle. Polysulfide dissolution is successfully suppressed by enhanced reaction kinetics. This work demonstrates an ether compatible sulfur cathode involving intermediate Li2Sn (n <= 4), attractive rate and cycling performance, and a promising solution towards applicable lithium-sulfur batteries.

As prepared materials are characterized with scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, FTIR, elemental analysis, XPS, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. The composite S-LFP cathode with MWCNTs additive shows improved discharge capacity and performance. It shows an initial discharge capacity of 1167 mAh/g-sulfur, or 70% of theoretical capacity. The discharge capacity measured after 20 cycles for S-LFP-MWCNTs composite cathode was 80% of the initial capacity and remained stable. After 160 charge/discharge tests, the cathode displays a stable capacity of 561 mAh/g-sulfur at the C-rate of 0.2 C. Combination of sulfur, LiFePO4 and MWCNTs prevents aggregation and volume change of the cathode particles and improves the conductivity and electrochemical stability during the long-term cycling. 3-D FTIR spectroscopy measurements confirmed improved chemical stability and safety of sulfur composites also at higher temperatures.

However, storage mechanism of carbon materials with different graphitization degree is different. Carbons with lower graphitization degree (I-G/I-D value) usually possess many defects and poor electrical conductivities. Carbon materials with high graphitization degree always possess less contact sites. Both two carbon materials are conducive to achieve sulfur loads. However, sulfur-loading capacities of two materials are different. In this paper, two carbon materials with different graphitization degrees are combined to form composite carbon materials. Studies show that composite carbon electrodes with suitable I-G/I-D values possess good sulfur-loading capacities (80%) because of high conductivity and defect contents. Two kinds of C-S bonds are produced after loading sulfur and both of them are conducive to stable production of polysulfides. One C-S bond is conducive to diffusion of lithium ions on electrode surface and the other C-S bond is conducive to rapid conversion of polysulfides. Under the performance of two C-S bonds, high capacity storage and good cycling stability can be achieved by electrodes under high sulfur-loading conditions.

The as-obtained CNFs were with an average diameter of similar to 60 nm, a high purity of similar to 91.6%, and a large specific surface area of 108.1 m(2) g(-1). When employed as anode materials, the N-HBCNFs yielded a reversible capacity of 500.0 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.10 C (1.0 C = 372 mA g(-1)) and rapid lithium storage properties with a high capacity of 141.6 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C. When the N-HBCNFs were used as catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction, an onset potential of 0.85 V, an electron transfer number of 3.1, and a current retention of 69.1% after 16,000 s test were detected, indicating the good reactivity of N-HBCNF catalyst for electrocatalysis application. The superior performance of N-HBCNFs was attributed to their enlarged graphitic lattice spacings and abundant edges on the surface, which afforded more active sites for both Li ion storage and oxygen reduction reaction.

Here, we demonstrate a new class of monolithic heterojunction quasi-solid-state electrolytes (MH-QEs) based on thermodynamically immiscible dual phases. As a proof-of-concept of the MH-QEs, their application to lithium-sulfur batteries is explored. Driven by combined effects of structural uniqueness and thermodynamic immiscibility, the electrode-customized MH-QEs provide exceptional electrochemical performance that lies far beyond those accessible with conventional battery electrolytes.

We use 35 mu m-thick, spongelike free-standing papers of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as three-dimensional conductive matrices and simply capture sulfur in them by sublimation without using any binder. Because of good wettability of sulfur on the CNT surface and careful control of the temperature difference between the sulfur source and the CNT paper, sulfur is deposited uniformly on the CNT paper at controllable contents of 20-80 mass %. The 23 mu m-thick, 1.5 g cm(-3)-dense electrode with 70 mass % sulfur showed a breakthrough volumetric discharge capacity of 1100 mA h cm(-3) with good gravimetric and areal discharge capacities of 1100 mA h g(sulfur)(-1), 763 mA h g(electrode)(-1), and 2.67 mA h cm(-2) at the eighth cycle. Furthermore, the electrode retained the very high discharge capacity of 990 mA h cm(-3) after 100 cycles. Such high performance is realized by employing our submillimeter-long, 99 mass %-pure, few-wall CNTs with careful control over the sulfur deposition process. Simple is the best; sulfur in the CNT sponge architecture minimizes additives and maximizes sulfur content and is promising to realize sulfur cathodes with practically high values for any of gravimetric, areal, and volumetric capacities.

However, the severe shuttle effect and sluggish conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides significantly impede the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Herein, a unique "soft on rigid" composite consist of oxygen-deficient and Co cluster-decorated TiO2 nanofibers with carbon nanofibers (CNF), embedding numerous Co nanoparticles (denoted as "Co-TiO2-x/CNF") is developed as a high-performance self-supporting multifunctional cathode electrocatalyst. The Co-TiO2-x/CNF offers vast surface area and enlarged porosity to homogenize sulfur distribution and enhance sulfur immobilization. The oxygen deficient Co-TiO2-x fiber and CNF establish a threedimensional conductive framework, which accelerates electron and ion transportation within the electrode. Meanwhile, the introduction of Co clusters significantly regulate the Ti d-band center and thereby improving the Li2S6 adsorbability. Benefiting from these synergistic features, the Li2S6/Co-TiO2-x/CNF electrode delivers outstanding cycling stability (capacity fading rate of 0.03% per cycle over 500 cycles) and an improved rate capability (743 mAh g(-1) at 3.0C). This design strategy based on synergy engineering could also open up new possibilities for the practical application of high performance Li-S batteries and promote the material design in related energy storage fields.

However, their relatively low selectivity and activity are related to the strong binding of reaction intermediates (e.g., CO*) on single Fe atoms. Here, combining experimental and theoretical studies, we show that introducing axial chlorine (Cl) atom can modulate the electronic structure of Fe atoms in catalytically active FeN4 sites, which facilitates the desorption of CO* and inhibits the adsorption of H*, resulting in improved activity and selectivity in CO2RR. The Cl modified Fe-N-C SAC embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (FeN4Cl/NC) was synthesized in two steps: pyrolyzing Fe-loaded two-dimensional zeolite imidazole framework nanosheets and low-temperature incubation in hydrochloric acid solution. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results reveal that most atomically dispersed Fe atoms are coordinated with one axial Cl atom at 2.26 angstrom and four N atoms at 2.02 angstrom. The optimized FeN4Cl/NC exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency of 90.5%, a high current density of 10.8 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 490 mV, and a high turnover frequency of 1566 h(-1), one of the best among recently reported Fe-based CO2RR catalysts. FeN4Cl/ NC was further applied as a bifunctional catalyst to construct rechargeable zinc-CO2 batteries, delivering a power density of 0.545 mW cm(-2) with excellent stability over 15 h. Tailoring the coordination environment of metal atoms in M-N-C SACs by introducing axial atoms may be further extended as an efficient general approach to design advanced catalysts for various electrochemical applications, such as fuel cells, nitrogen fixation, and lithium-sulfur batteries.

J	Gu, TL; Wei, BQ				Gu, Taoli; Wei, Bingqing			All-Solid-State Stretchable Pseudocapacitors Enabled by Carbon Nanotube Film-Capped Sandwich-like Electrodes	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						pseudocapacitors; sandwich-like electrode; carbon nanotube film capping; synergistic effect; adhesion; stretchability	LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; ENERGY-STORAGE; SUPERCAPACITORS; GRAPHENE; CONDUCTORS; DEVICES; SYSTEMS	Stretchable pseudocapacitors have demonstrated perspective potential as the power sources for stretchable/flexible electronics. However, one of the main limitations is to increase the mass loading of pseudocapacitive materials while maintaining high electrochemical performance. Therefore, the architectural design of stable and stretchable electrodes with a high mass loading of pseudocapacitive materials becomes critical and desirable. Here we report an all-solid-state sandwich-like stretchable pseudocapacitor, which overcomes the limitation of maximum loading of active pseudocapacitive materials and exhibits excellent structural and electrochemical stabilities, giving rise to outstanding cycling stability and rate capability. The enhanced pseudocapacitive performances result from the synergistic effect in the all-solid-state and binder-free structure: (1) faster ion diffusion rates and charge transport at electrode/electrolyte interfaces and (2) improved mechanical property to mitigate the electrode degradation caused by ion insertion/extraction during charge-discharge and mechanically stretching-releasing cycles. This novel component-level design offers an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of stretchable pseudocapacitors, and more importantly, this concept can be extended for improving the performance of other electrochemical systems such as stretchable supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and solar cells, and accelerate its applications for wearable and implantable electronics.

Sulfur Speciation in Li-S Batteries Determined by Operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							DISCHARGE PROCESS; LITHIUM; CATHODE; ELECTROLYTES; POLYSULFIDES; DIFFRACTION; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITES; ELECTRODES; REDUCTION	Among the Most challenging I. issues in electrochemical energy storage is developing insightful in situ probes of redox processes for a working cell. This is particularly true for. cells that operate on the basis of chemical transformations such as Li-S and Li-O-2, where the factors that govern capacity and cycling stability are difficult to access owing to the amorphous nature of the intermediate species. Here, we investigate cathodes for the Li-S cell comprised of sulfur-imbibed robust spherical carbon shells with tailored porosity that exhibit excellent cycling stability. Their highly regular nanoscale dimensions and thin carbon shells allow highly uniform electrochemical response and further enable direct monitoring of sulfur speciation Within the cell over the entire redox range by operand X-ray absorption spectroscopy on the S K-edge. The results reveal the first detailed evidence of the mechanisms of sulfur redox chemistry on cycling, showing how sulfur fraction (under utilization) and sulfide precipitation impact Capacity. Such information is critical for promoting improvements in Li-S batteries.

The unique feature of this particular model is that the sulfur layer does not contain any conductive materials, and therefore, the top CNT film of the prepared three-layer CNT/S/CNT electrode is electrically isolated from the bottom CNT film. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that the three-layer cathode was transformed into a single CNT cathode, with proximate contact between the two CNT films in the upper plateau of the first discharge. The lithium sulfur cells employing a CNT/S/CNT cathode exhibited remarkably enhanced performance in terms of the specific capacity, rate property, and cycling stability compared to the cells with a sulfur-coated CNT cathode. This can mainly be attributed to the top CNT film, which serves not only as an interlayer to trap the migrating polysulfides, but also as an electrode to facilitate the redox reaction of active materials. Such an innovative approach is promising as it may promote the rational design of high-performance sulfur cathodes.

Using density functional theory we show that Ti atoms will not cluster at moderate concentrations when doped into nanoporous graphene. Since each Ti atom can bind up to three hydrogen molecules with an average binding energy of 0.54 eV/H-2, this material can be ideal for storing hydrogen under ambient thermodynamic conditions. In addition, nanoporous graphene is magnetic with or without Ti doping, but when it is fully saturated with hydrogen, the magnetism disappears. This novel feature suggests that nanoporous graphene cannot only be used for storing hydrogen, but also as a hydrogen sensor.

Currently, the main challenges faced by silicon (Si) electrodes are volume change and low intrinsic electrical conductivity since the former will lead to severe particle pulverization and the latter will result in poor cycle performance. Herein, a 3D multilayer composite material featuring interconnected network structure was designed using electrospinning technique and low temperature heat treatment method. The unique structure was alternately composed of Si-encapsulated conjugated carbon nanofibers and graphene oxide (GO) layers. The conjugated carbon nanofibers network formed by polyacrylonitrile can not only shorten the ion transport path, but also alleviate volume expansion of Si during lithium ion insertion/extraction due to its well-maintained polymer elasticity. The addition of GO in the multilayer of carbon nanofibers network effectively enhanced the conductivity of the whole electrode, and greatly reduced the direct contact between Si and electrolyte. As a result, the binderless and free-standing Si-based composite electrode with maintained structural integrity effectively improved the capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency of Si anode. The composite electrode was prepared through a facile and high-yield process, showing potential commercial application value.

The direct introduction of functional guests within or around CNT fibers meets problems due to the rough fiber surface and weak interfacial bindings. To improve the functionality and performance stability, we report a new method to modify the surface roughness and level of functionalization of CNT fibers, by wrapping graphene oxide (GO) or reduced graphene (RG) around them. Besides the functional groups on the graphene sheets, the introduction of a graphene layer also has smoothing and shield effects, resulting in higher tensile strength and improved and stabilized performance. The electrochemical and photocurrent applications were exploited by depositing polyaniline around GO-wrapped CNT fibers and TiO2 around RG-wrapped fibers, with a capacitance up to 229.5 F cm(-3) and a photocurrent density of 132 mu A cm(-2), respectively. The present technique has the advantage that the mechanical and functional properties can be optimized by simply modifying the core CNT fiber via polymer infiltration during the fiber spinning.

A microporous-mesoporous carbon with graphitic structure for a high-rate stable sulfur cathode in carbonate solvent-based Li-S batteries	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; SECONDARY BATTERIES; CELL ELECTROLYTE; HIGH-CAPACITY; HIGH-POWER; PERFORMANCE; DISCHARGE; COMPOSITES; ENERGY	A microporous-mesoporous carbon with graphitic structure was developed as a matrix for the sulfur cathode of a Li-S cell using a mixed carbonate electrolyte. Sulfur was selectively introduced into the carbon micropores by a melt adsorption-solvent extraction strategy. The micropores act as solvent-restricted reactors for sulfur lithiation that promise long cycle stability. The mesopores remain unfilled and provide an ion migration pathway, while the graphitic structure contributes significantly to low-resistance electron transfer. The selective distribution of sulfur in micropores was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen cryosorption analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The high-rate stable lithiation-delithiation of the carbon-sulfur cathode was evaluated using galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The cathode is able to operate reversibly over 800 cycles with a 1.8 C discharge-recharge rate. This integration of a micropore reactor, a mesopore ion reservoir, and a graphitic electron conductor represents a generalized strategy to be adopted in research on advanced sulfur cathodes.

The specially designed electrode offers adequate space to accommodate a large amount of sulfur and facilitate the enhanced immobilization of polysulfide ions. Moreover, polar-based oxides inbuilt in the electrode favor in suppressing the polysulfide shuttling effect. The initial specific capacity of Li polysulfide (Li2S8) in FSME is 1210 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with remarkable capacity retention upon cycling. The capacity stabilizes at 970 mAh g(-1) at 100th cycle indicating the excellent cycling ability of FSME. Further, this membrane electrode alleviates the cost issues associated with most of the carbon nanotube-based electrodes.	[Ragupathy, P.; Ahad, Syed Abdul; Kumar, P.

Aluminum with appropriate potential, high-capacity, and electronic conductivity can alloy with Li spontaneously and is proposed herein as a carbon-free and binder-free anode of an all-solid-state Li-S battery (LSB). A biphasic lithiation reaction of Al with modest volume change was revealed by in situ characterization. The Li0.8Al alloy anode showed excellent compatibility toward the Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) electrolyte, as verified by the steady Li0.8Al-LGPS-Li0.8Al cell operation for over 2500 hours at 0.5 mA cm(-2). An all-solid-state LSB comprising Li0.8Al alloy anode and melting-coated S composite cathode functioned steadily for over 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 93.29%. Furthermore, a Li-S full cell with a low negative-to-positive ratio of 1.125 delivered a specific energy of 541 Wh kg(-1). This work provides an applicable anode selection for all-solid-state LSBs and promotes their practical procedure.

Herein, we have demonstrated a proof of concept, a lithium-polysulfide full cell battery using various lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) electrolyte concentrations with glass-fiber-based composite and hard carbon as the cathode and anode, respectively. The initial capacity of the lithium-polysulfide full cell is found to be 970 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. The capacity is stabilized at 870 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles with a capacity retention of 88.6%. An excellent capacity retention of approximate to 80% is achieved after long 800 cycles at 0.5 C by using full cell technology. Further, our post-mortem analysis sheds light on the difference in SEI layer formation on hard carbon anodes with changing electrolyte concentration, thereby indicating reasons for the obtainment of a high cyclic performance with 1 m LiTFSI salt electrolyte. The successful demonstration of the long cyclic performance of Li-polysulfide full cells is indeed a step towards producing high performance Li-polysulfide full cell batteries with long cycling using conventional LiTFSI salt electrolyte and commercial anode materials.

The results show that the introduction of CTAB to the S-GO nanocomposite and changes in the synthesis recipe including alteration of the S precursor ratios and the sequence of mixing ingredients lead to the formation of different S species. CTAB modifies the cathode materials through bonding with Na2Sx in the precursor solution, which is subsequently converted to C-S bonds during the heat treatment at 155 degrees C. Moreover, GO bonds with CTAB and acts as the nucleation center for S precipitation. All these interactions among S, CTAB, and GO help to immobilize the sulfur in the cathode and may be responsible for the enhanced cell cycle life of CTAB-S-GO nanocomposite-based Li/S cells.

We used a facile, versatile phase-transition method for forming Group 6A nanoparticles on carbonaceous templates to produce homogeneous 5-10 nm diameter Group 6A nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), to obtain nanocomposites. The method involved melting and recrystallizing mixtures of elemental sulfur and either CNTs or RGO on carbonaceous templates. The surface tension and hydrophilicity of the molten Group 6A species surfaces and the oxygen functional groups on the carbonaceous template surfaces were considered in depth to provide important guidelines for forming Group 6A nanoparticles on carbonaceous templates. The surface tension of the molten Group 6A species should be intrinsically low, leading to effective wetting on the carbonaceous template. In addition, the molten Group 6A species hydrophilic surfaces were essential for enabling hydrophilic-hydrophilic interaction for selective wetting at the oxygen functional groups on the carbonaceous template, leading to the heterogeneous nucleation of nanoparticles. Furthermore, the size and morphology (isolated vs layer-like) of the Group 6A nanoparticles were tuned by adjusting the oxidation state of the carbonaceous template. We investigated the potential application of the nanocomposites prepared using this method to cathode materials in lithium-sulfur secondary batteries.

Exploring 3D microstructural evolution in Li-Sulfur battery electrodes using in-situ X-ray tomography	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							S BATTERIES; LITHIUM; CATHODE; DIFFRACTION; COMPOSITE	Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries offer higher theoretical specific capacity, lower cost and enhanced safety compared to current Li-ion battery technology. However, the multiple reactions and phase changes in the sulfur conversion cathode result in highly complex phenomena that significantly impact cycling life. For the first time to the authors' knowledge, a multi-scale 3D in-situ tomography approach is used to characterize morphological parameters and track microstructural evolution of the sulfur cathode across multiple charge cycles. Here we show the uneven distribution of the sulfur phase fraction within the electrode thickness as a function of charge cycles, suggesting significant mass transport limitations within thick-film sulfur cathodes. Furthermore, we report a shift towards larger particle sizes and a decrease in volume specific surface area with cycling, suggesting sulfur agglomeration. Finally, we demonstrate the nano-scopic length-scale required for the features of the carbon binder domain to become discernible, confirming the need for future work on in-situ nano-tomography. We anticipate that X-ray tomography will be a powerful tool for optimization of electrode structures for Li-S batteries.	[Yermukhambetova, Assiya; Tan, Chun; Daemi, Sohrab R.; Brett, Daniel J.

However, several severe issues such as uncontrollable lithium dendrites and infinitely large volume change are urgently needed to be solved, since they cause very short cycle life and severe safety hazards. Here we explore an effective strategy to create lamellar structured flexible Ti3C2 MXene (graphene, BN)-lithium film anode, based on the unique ductility of metallic lithium and lubricity of these nanosheets. By harnessing the lithiophobic property of atomic layers, not only the nucleation and growth of lithium dendrites can be efficiently controlled, but also the plating lithium is well confined in the nanoscaled gaps of above nanosheets. As a consequence, the optimal Ti3C2 MXene-lithium film anode exhibits significantly low overpotential (32 mV at 1.0 mA cm(-2)) with a very small increase of 1.5% in 200 cycles, flat voltage profiles and good high-rate performances (53 mV at 3.0 mA cm(-2)).

The synthesized-carbonized cotton cloth (SCC) owns distinctive carbon nature with perfect order level and defects, unique porous microstructure, and crosslinked-network. The SCC exhibits favorable flexibility, fast kinetics, high structural and electrochemical durability with high performance (239.4 mAh g(-1) and 155.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.01 A g(-1) in the ether- and ester-based electrolyte in sodium-ion batteries, respectively), superior to commonly-used commercial carbon cloth and graphene film. In addition, the predominant surface-controlled reaction mechanism, effective solid electrolyte interphase and favorable compatible features with different electrolytes are also intensively studied.

However, the cycling and rate performance of the sulfur cathode are seriously hindered by the notorious polysulfide dissolution and its low conductivity. Sulfurized carbon materials containing covalently bonded sulfur chains have shown relatively better stability for Li-S batteries. In this study, we report the improvement of the high-rate performance of sulfurized carbon cathodes derived through vulcanization of polyacrylonitrile. We compared sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVDF) as cathode binders for the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) electrode. The SPAN cathode using the NaCMC binder showed a capacity of 938 mA h g (-1) after 450 cycles at 0.9C rate (1C = 1675 mA h g (1)) and a capacity of 677 mA h g (1) at 5C rate; both performances are much superior to that of the SPAN cathode using the PVDF binder. This result illustrates the feasibility of using water-soluble oxygen-containing binders to improve the C-rate performance of sulfurized carbons.

It is shown that the morphology and structure of VGNWs can be effectively tailored by experimental conditions. Furthermore, the growth mechanism of VGNWs produced in the plasma-based approach has been investigated. The synthesized VGNWs are used as anode materials in Li-ion batteries and the batteries show outstanding cycle efficiency (similar to 99%). The specific capacity of coin-type cells can be improved by adjusting the experimental parameters and reaches 400 mAh g(-1) in the first charge-discharge cycle. This work is particularly important for the development of an advanced process for the synthesis and application of carbon-based nanomaterials.

Herein, we develop a facile synthesis strategy to convert oxide into nitride materials - which represent high conductivity - by using nontoxic urea instead of hazard ammonia as nitric source. In particular, we have successfully synthesized carbon doped tungsten nitride (C-WN) materials through tungsten oxide, which introduces carbon-doping and lacunar surface to WN but with the conserved overall nanostructures of tungsten oxide. Their potential applications as the polysulfide host for lithium-polysulfide batteries are also investigated, as featured by the elevated electronic conductivity of WN materials with multi-active sites of tungsten, nitrogen and carbon. Attributable to the tailored material of synergetic effects, the enhanced electronic conductivity of the C-WN material not only accelerates the redox electrochemical reaction of polysulfides via the efficient redox electron transfer, but also reveals effectively immobilize polysulfides on the multi-active sites. As a result, C-WN-based lithium-polysulfide cell achieves initial 909 mAh/g at 3.2 mA/cm(2), and retains 638 mAh/g after 500 cycles. This work offers a facile nitride synthesis strategy with carbon doping and rough surface, and further towards developing high efficiency lithium-polysulfide batteries and enlightening the material design in the energy storage technologies.

To combat the solubility of polysulphides, confinement approaches aiming to trap sulphur within the cathode side have been pursued, but success has been limited. Herein, we drastically deviate from this approach and use a liquid cathode obtained either by dissolving polysulphides within the electrolyte or by placing sulphur powders in contact with the Li negative electrode. Such approaches are shown to result in greater performance than confinement approaches. Such a strategy eliminates the detrimental Li2S formation inside a porous carbon matrix and moreover leads to the formation of a protective SEI layer at the Li electrode, as deduced by impedance spectroscopy and XPS, which seems beneficial to the cell cycling performance.

However, tailoring the microstructure of these membranes is hard to achieve and the surface utilization of graphene layers is low. By analyzing the drying process for the wet graphene oxide membrane (GOM), it is found that the trapped water in freshly formed GOM actually provides potential forces to tune its microstructure. According to the phase diagram of pure water, with a reduced pressure, the trapped water boils seriously and then transforms into ice crystal instantaneously around the triple point. This sudden phase change across the triple point provides strong forces to change and fix the microstructure of GOM. In this study, the ordinary evaporation drying process for the wet GOM is replaced with a two-stage drying process and the tightly layered structure of graphene membrane is turned into an open and grade structure. The obtained membrane shows high surface utilization. Thus, after reduction, the membrane possesses high adsorption capability towards various molecules, especially for heavy oil and lithium polysulfide products in the cathode of Li-S battery. Furthermore, the membrane shows high rate performance as the electrodes for supercapacitors.

J	Saroja, APVK; Muthusamy, K; Sundara, R				Saroja, Ajay Piriya Vijaya Kumar; Muthusamy, Kamaraj; Sundara, Ramaprabhu			Strong Surface Bonding of Polysulfides by Teflonized Carbon Matrix for Enhanced Performance in Room Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Battery	ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES			English	Article						graphene nanoribbon; multiwalled carbon nanotubes; polytetrafluoroethylene; room temperature; sodium; sulfur	LITHIUM-SULFUR; SEPARATOR; POLYACRYLONITRILE; INTERLAYERS; GRAPHENE	The practical application of room temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) battery remains far away from the market due to the poor coulombic efficiency and cyclic stability which in turn arises from high dissolution of intermediate polysulfides in carbonate-based electrolytes, slow reaction kinetics, and low electrical conductivity of sulfur. In this aspect, an advanced cathode structure by incorporating Teflon-lined conductive carbon substrate (TCS) as a supporting cathode to efficiently immobilize the migration of soluble polysulfides to the anode, as well as enhance the conductivity during the polysulfide conversion, is presented here. After inclusion of TCS, the cell delivers a specific capacity of 800 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C (1C = 1672 mA g(-1)) with 85% enhancement in specific capacity. Also, a stable cyclic stability of about 300 cycles with an excellent capacity retention of about 93% and coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% is obtained. Teflon, which has a linear carbon chain surrounded completely by fluorine atoms, acts as the anchoring sites for trapping the intermediate sodium polysulfides. This study provides a simple approach of controlling the shuttling effect, which can be beneficial for the development of high energy density room temperature Na-S battery.

J	Mukherjee, S; Kavalsky, L; Chattopadhyay, K; Singh, CV				Mukherjee, Sankha; Kavalsky, Lance; Chattopadhyay, Kinnor; Singh, Chandra Veer			Adsorption and diffusion of lithium polysulfides over blue phosphorene for Li-S batteries	NANOSCALE			English	Article							SULFUR-BATTERIES; DIRECTIONAL DIFFUSION; ANCHORING MATERIAL; POTENTIAL CATHODE; RES2 NANOSHEETS; ANODE MATERIALS; ENERGY-STORAGE; DOPED GRAPHENE; PERFORMANCE; BOROPHENE	Lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries suffer from capacity loss due to the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Although finding cathodes that can trap LiPSs strongly is a possible solution to suppress the shuttle effect, fast diffusion of lithium and LiPSs is also pivotal to prevent agglomeration. We report that monolayer blue phosphorene (BP), a recently synthesized two-dimensional material, possesses these characteristics as a cathode in Li-S batteries. Density functional theory calculations showed that while the adsorption energies (E-b) of various LiPSs over pristine BP are reasonably strong (from -0.86 eV to -2.45 eV), defect engineering of the lattice by introducing a single vacancy (SV) increased the binding strength significantly, with E-b in the range of -1.41 eV to -4.34 eV. Ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations carried out at 300 K showed that the single vacancies trap the Li atoms in the LiPSs compared to pristine BP. Projected density of states revealed that the creation of an SV induces metallicity in the cathode. Furthermore, an increase in the adsorption strength did not cause significant structural deformation, implying that the soluble large LiPSs did not decompose, which is essential to suppress capacity fading. The energy barriers for LiPSs' migration over pristine BP are minimal to ensure ultrafast diffusion, with the lowest diffusion energy barriers being 0.23 eV, 0.13 eV and 0.18 eV for Li2S4, Li2S6 and Li2S8, respectively. Furthermore, the energy barrier associated with the catalytic oxidation of Li2S over pristine and defective BP was found to be greater than three times smaller compared to graphene, which suggests that charging processes could be faster by orders of magnitude. Therefore, BP with a suitable combination of defects would be an excellent cathode material in Li-S batteries.

These SnO2/GFs exhibited a 3D hierarchical porous architecture with mesopores (approximate to 3nm), macropores (3-6m), and a large surface area (244m(2)g(-1)), which not only effectively prevented the agglomeration of SnO2 nanoparticles, but also facilitated fast ion and electron transport in 3D pathways. As a consequence, the SnO2/GFs exhibited a high capacity of 830mAhg(-1) for up to 70 charge-discharge cycles at 100mAg(-1). Even at a high current density of 500mAg(-1), a reversible capacity of 621mAhg(-1) could be maintained for SnO2/GFs with excellent cycling stability. Such performance is superior to that of previously reported SnO2/graphene and other SnO2/carbon composites with similar weight contents of SnO2.

The electrochemical performance of Li2S can be remarkably improved by introducing carbon to form Li2S-carbon composites. However, the complex preparation process of Li2S-carbon composites limits their large-scale applications. Herein, we present a green and facile strategy to synthesize porous carbon-coated Li2S-carbon nanotube composites (Li2S@PC-CNT) by heating carbon disulfide (CS2) and the lithium hydride-CNT mixture at a temperature below 250 degrees C, which is the lowest temperature for in situ synthesis of Li2S-carbon composites reported till date. For the Li2S@PC-CNT composites, Li2S@PC particles are connected with neighboring particles through the 3D CNTs network skeleton. This unique nanoarchitecture not only prevents the loss of active materials and diffusion of polysulfides, but also significantly facilitates fast electron and ion transport. As a result, a high specific capacity (820 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) after 10 cycles) and a remarkable cycle life (502 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) after 300 cycles) are achieved. The rationally designed structure and superior electrochemical performance of the Li2S@PC-CNT composites will pave a new avenue for realizing high energy density of Li-S batteries.

Here, a regular octahedral structure and abundant hierarchical porous S/MIL-101(Cr)-H, as the electrode of Li-S battery to catch and anchor polysulfides for alleviating the "shuttle effect" and strengthening the utilization of S, were synthesized by usual hydrothermal and facile heat treatment. Consequently, compared with S/MIL-101(Cr) (719.52 mA h g(-1)), S/MIL-101(Cr)-H shows better initial discharge capacity (1073.59 mA h g(-1)) and the reversible capacity remains (446.59 mA h g(-1)) after 100 cycles at 0.1C, which is much greater than S/MIL-101(Cr). A capacity of 504.26 mA h g(-1) and Coulombic efficiency of approximately 95% at 0.5 C were obtained. The better electrochemical property is ascribed to the coordinated effect of the adsorption of microporous structure and chemical bonding of Cr-S, which can effectively capture the soluble polysulfides and alleviate "shuttle effect" through physical confinement and chemical anchoring.

However, conventional organic polysulfanes usually suffer from poor reversibility due to structure variation and irreversible conversion during cycling. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel two-dimensional (2D) organic polysulfane with a unique molecular structure of polycyclic sulfur directly substituting the carboxyls of poly(acrylic acid) and grafted on the carbon chain through a coupling reaction with KI as a catalyst and KCl as a template. The obtained organic polysulfane nanosheets with 72 wt% sulfur (OPNS-72) exhibit high initial capacity of 891 mAh/g (based on whole composite), excellent cycling stability (0.014% capacity fading per cycle over 620 cycles at 1 C rate), superior rate capability (562 mAh/g at 10 C) and high mass loading of 9.7 mg/cm(2). The remarkable cycling stability of the Li-S battery is attributed to the structural stability and highly reversible electrochemical reaction of the OPNS-72 electrode, as confirmed by the TEM image after cycling and operando Raman spectroscopy measurements under battery operating conditions. Further, the developed synthesis approach is applicable for the preparation of other organic polysulfane nanosheets as highly reversible electrodes for Li-S batteries.

A 1-D electrochemical model is proposed predicting the cell voltage at 60% discharge depth. In the model, increasing electrolyte amount improves the cell voltage by linearly increasing the cathode exchange current density, which is the single kinetic model parameter. Moreover, cathode specific capacity is either defined as a linear function of the E/S ratio or taken constant in the performance models. Increasing E/S ratio enhances the cell- and systems-level specific energy and energy density until 9 mL/g S when cathode specific capacity depends on the E/S ratio. However, when the cathode specific capacity is constant at 1200 mAh/g S, battery performance decreases continuously with increasing electrolyte amount. The effect of other critical design parameters-cathode thickness, carbon-to-sulfur ratio, S loading and excess Li%- are also considered in the analysis. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, we report the preparation of mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon scaffolds (NCSs) to restrain selenium for advanced lithium-selenium (Li-Se) batteries. The NCSs synthesized by a bottom-up solution-phase method have graphene-like laminar structure and well-distributed mesopores. The unique architecture of NCSs can severe as conductive framework for encapsulating selenium and polyselenides, and provide sufficient pathways to facilitate ion transport. Furthermore, the laminar and porous NCSs can effectively buffer the volume variation during charge/discharge processes. The integrated composite of Se-NCSs has a high Se content and can ensure the complete electrochemical reactions of Se and Li species. When used for Li-Se batteries, the cathodes based on Se-NCSs exhibit high capacity, remarkable cyclability, and excellent rate performance.

They are abundant, rich in structure, and easy for synthesis. Here, we report a new class of organosulfur polymers synthesized by condensation reactions between 1,3,5-benzenetrithiol (BTT) and elemental sulfur with three different molar ratios (i.e., 1:1.5, 1:3.0, and 1:4.5) in carbon disulfide solution without heating and additional catalyst. Removal of H2S leads to the linkage of S-S bonds, forming hyperbranched polymers. When the BTT: sulfur molar ratio is 1:4.5, the polymer has a high theoretical specific capacity of 901.7 mAh g-1. We have studied their structures and compositions through a series of material characterizations, and conducted an in-depth discussion on their electrochemical behavior in rechargeable lithium batteries. Excellent cycling performance of these materials shows great potential for practical application.

Herein, to tackle these problems simultaneously, a strategy is demonstrated for preparing defective MoxC@NC with rich incorporated Mo vacancies, additional active sites and nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) coating for boosting the performance of Li-S batteries. The hollow structure of MoxC@NC achieves the physical confinement of the active materials and facilitates the ion/electrolyte penetration. Relevant experiments confirmed that the meso-microporous thin outer shell and the uniformly distributed MoxC nanoparticles in the shell can significantly suppress the LiPSs shuttle effect by chemisorption. Furthermore, the defective MoxC can accelerate conversion of LiPSs by a catalytic effect, promoting the polysulfide redox kinetics of the sulfur species and prevent the dissolution of polysulfides. The resultant 77S-MoxC@NC electrode acquired 982 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.14% per cycle.

It is demonstrated that graphene with a work function of approximately 5 eV favors the efficiency improvement. The absorption loss is also an unnegligible factor for the optimization of the graphene work function. The density of interface states can significantly affect the carrier recombination at the heterojunction interface between graphene and GaAs and the corresponding photovoltaic performance. In addition, the work function of a back electrode should also be taken into account for selecting a back electrode material due to its significant influence on the carrier transportation and collection. Furthermore, when an AlxGa1-xAs (x = 0.2) buffer layer was introduced to this heterojunction interface, an enhanced photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 24.78% can be achieved. Finally, a comparison among simulation and experimental data for the graphene/GaAs heterojunction solar cells is presented.

Nevertheless, the heavy shuttling and extremely slow sulfur redox kinetics severely impede its progress. Herein, we develop a dual-conductive 1T-VS2 - MXene heterostructured electrocatalyst as a high-efficiency sulfur host, which combines the merits of ultrafast anchoring and catalysis (1T-VS2) with good nucleation and surface diffusion (MXene) for accelerating the bidirectional sulfur redox kinetics, regulating the Li2S nucleation and decomposition, and depressing the polysulfide shuttling. And combining a design of dense sulfur cathode, the highly dense S/1T-VS2 - MXene monolith cathode (density: 1.91 g cm(-3), conductivity: 76.3 S m(-1)) achieves a high volumetric capacity of 1571 Ah L-1 (based on the total volume of sulfur cathode) (gravimetric capacity: ~& nbsp;1430 mAh g(-1) based on sulfur) in a routine electrolyte at 0.1 C and a large areal capacity of ~7.9 mAh cm(-2) in an extremely lean electrolyte of 3 mu L mgs(-1) at 0.05 C. Experimental and theoretical results also clearly reveal the origin of superior performance and the synergistic mechanism of heterostructured catalyst from the perspective of the electronic structure and atomic level. Therefore, this deep work demonstrates the feasibility for the fabrication of LSBs with high volumetric and areal capacities in lean electrolytes by combining the dual-conductive heterostructure electrocatalyst with the dense-structured sulfur cathode.

On the one hand, MnO as a polar material can anchor lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) on the interface via chemical bonding. In addition, introducing oxygen vacancies into MnO by heat treatment under a reducing atmosphere can regulate the electronic structure and provide extra active sites for further boosting the chemical adsorption capability of LiPSs, facilitating the redox reaction of LiPSs, as well as enhancing the electron transfer efficiency. On the other hand, the MnOOVs/NCNTs layer is a barrier to block the LiPSs directly diffusing through the separator and acts as an upper collector to reduce the interface resistance reactivate the trapped sulfur species, thereby enhancing the sulfur utilization. Given these advantages, the MnO-OVs/NCNTs modified separator employed in Li-S batteries exhibit considerable capacity (1516 mAh g-1 at 0.1C), enhanced long-term cycling stability (ca-pacity retention of 618 mAh g-1 for over 500 cycles at 1C), and rate performance (550 mAh g-1 at 3C).

However, an important problem, termed the "shuttle effect", can lead to capacity decay in Li-Se cells (and in Li-S cells), which arises from aggregation and the loss of Se or S from the cathode into the electrolyte. In this work, in order to solve this problem, a new self-repairing system has been devised, in which some Se atoms are chemically bonded to the carbon atoms of graphene and act as reclaiming points for dissociated Se atoms through the establishment of -Se-Se-Se-chains. Se-decorated graphene (Se-GE) was first constructed through a facile high-energy ball-milling process. Its formation was confirmed by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, and Raman analyses. As we anticipated, in examining cell properties, the as-prepared Se-GE composite underwent an initial capacity decay in the first 20 cycles (from 1050 mAh g(-1) to 750 mAh g(-1), ca. 29% loss), but the capacity then reverted to 970 mAh g(-1) (ca. 92% of the initial value). Other measurements were also consistent with the recapture of dissociated Se atoms.

The cross-linked DA-PEI nanoparticles can be adsorbed to the PP separator by the quinonyl groups of DA efficiently. The electrolyte wettability of the modified separator is obviously improved. The Li-S battery with the modified separator delivers a high cycling capacity and rate capacity. The specific capacity of Li-S battery with A1P3 separator is 1033.4 mA h g(-1) and stabilizes at 470.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles. And its rate capacity at 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, and 2 C is 1016.5 mA h g(-1), 754.6 mA h g(-1), 676.2 mA h g(-1), and 463.6 mA h g(-1), respectively. The outstanding electrochemical performance could be ascribed to that the polar deposited layer, which not only alleviates the shuttle effect by physical blocking and electrostatic interactions, but also facilitates Li+ ions migration by the improved electrolyte wettability.

Enhancement of long stability of sulfur cathode by encapsulating sulfur into micropores of carbon spheres	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES; IONIC LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; HIGH-ENERGY DENSITY; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; POLYMER-SULFUR; COMPOSITE; CELL; PERFORMANCE; ADSORPTION; SURFACE	To enhance the long stability of sulfur cathode for a high energy lithium-sulfur battery system, a sulfur-carbon sphere composite was prepared by encapsulating sulfur into micropores of carbon spheres by thermal treatment of a mixture of sublimed sulfur and carbon spheres. The elemental sulfur exists as a highly dispersed state inside the micropores of carbon spheres with a large surface area and a narrow pore distribution, based on the analyses of the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetry (TG) and local element line-scanning. It is demonstrated from galvanostatic discharge-charge process, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) that the sulfur-carbon sphere composite has a large reversible capacity and an excellent high rate discharge capability as cathode materials. In particular, the sulfur-carbon sphere composite with 42 wt% sulfur presents a long electrochemical stability up to 500 cycles, based on the constrained electrochemical reaction inside the narrow micropores of carbon spheres due to strong adsorption. Therefore, the electrochemical reaction constrained inside the micropores proposed here would be the dominant factor for the enhanced long stability of the sulfur cathode. The knowledge acquired in this study is important not only for the design of efficient new electrode materials, but also for understanding the effect of the micropores on the electrochemical cycle stability.

In this work, first principles simulations are applied to study structural rearrangement of the MoS2/graphene heterointerface upon lithiation and delithiation. The atomic structures of MoS2/graphene after lithiation and delithiation processes indicates that the lithiated configuration cannot be restore to the original structure under delithiation. Both the length of Li-S bond and the distribution of Mo-Mo distance correspond to the permanent structural change of MoS2. The rearrangement in atomic configuration will influence the next lithiation process and result in irreversible lithium loss. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We demonstrate here that after coating polypropylene (PP) separator with a continuous monolayer graphene, the shuttle effect can be significantly suppressed by limiting the passage of long-chain LiPS. The graphene/PP separator can be further modified by sealing the big holes or pores on graphene with in situ polymerized nylon-66 via an interfacial polymerization reaction between diamine and adipoyl chloride supplied by the aqueous and oil phase, respectively, from each side of the membrane. With this engineered membrane, an initial specific capacity of 1128.4 mAh g1 at 0.05C is achieved after test in a coin cell, higher than that of 983.2 mAh g(-1) with pristine PP, along with increased Coulombic efficiency from 96.0 to 99.9% and enhanced cycling durability. Molecular dynamics simulations attest that the nanopores with appropriate size and structure are effective in acting as a sieve to selectively allow only Li+ ions to pass through but prevent LiPS from migrating to the anode, consequently alleviating the shuttle effect. Our method provides a facile solution toward the mitigated shuttle effect and eventually contributes to the high performance of LiS battery.

Graphene-based nanocomposites have attracted considerable attention in photocatalytic research owing to their excellent electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. In this work, TiO2 material was modified with graphene by a hydrothermal method, the photocatalytic performance of the prepared catalyst was evaluated by degradation of 4-nitrophenol, which is a highly toxic, stable and carcinogenic organic pollutant. RESULTS: The characterization results showed that the low amount of graphene disperses well over TiO2 and it does not influence the crystal phase, but makes the specific surface area of graphene/TiO2 greater than that of TiO2. Compared with TiO2, graphene/TiO2 exhibits enhanced photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 4-nitrophenol under simulated solar irradiation. CONCLUSION: The enhanced activity of photo-degradation could be attributed to the involved graphene being beneficial to charge transportation and separation of photogenerated charge carriers, and providing more surface active sites for degradation reaction of the target pollutant. The present result highlights the important application of graphene as a novel carbon material in treating highly toxic pollutant through photocatalysis technology.

Simon			Facile Synthesis of CoS Nanoparticles Anchored on the Surface of Functionalized Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes as Cathode Materials for Advanced Li-S Batteries	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access							REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; SULFUR CATHODE; POROUS CARBON; RATIONAL DESIGN; COMPOSITE; POLYSULFIDE; COBALT; SULFIDE; NETWORK	The effects of CoS loading (10, 20, and 30%) on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on electrochemical performance for Li-S batteries were investigated. A facile hydrothermal method was used to grow CoS nanoparticles in situ on the surface of MWCNTs. In addition, CoS on functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) was also investigated. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the structure and electronic state of CoS on the surface of MWCNTs and f-MWCNTs. The initial discharge capacities and reversible specific capacities after 200 cycles were found to be 980 and 612 mAh/g, 990 and 707 mAh/g, and 959 and 658 mAh/g for the 10, 20, and 30% CoS samples, respectively. Interestingly, the 20% CoS@MWCNTs show the best initial discharge capacity and retention after 200 cycles. This finding can be attributed to the fact that high CoS loading (30%) may not be dispersed evenly on the MWCNT surface, while low CoS loading (10%) leads to fewer CoS and weaker adsorption for polysulfides. Moreover, the 20% CoS/f-MWCNTs show even higher initial discharge capacities of 1103 mAh/g and reversible specific capacities of 796 mAh/g after 200 cycles. This can be attributed to a rougher surface with more active sites on f-MWCNTs for trapping polysulfides and for enhancing the electronic conductivity of the cathode composite. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra show prominent peaks at 162.7 and 163.9 eV, which correspond to Co-S and C-S bonds, respectively, suggesting that CoS bonds well with MWCNTs. It is postulated that CoS/f-MWCNTs play a role in adsorbing lithium polysulfides (LPS) during the charge and discharge process and accelerating the kinetics of polysulfide conversion.

Both overprotection and inadequate protection of the sulfur cathode are unfavorable for the cycling of Li-S batteries.

Here, without additional binders we present a simple vacuum filtration method to synthesize [GRAPHICS] nitrogen and sulfur codoped graphene (N,S-G) blocking layer, which is ultra-lightweight, conductive, and free standing. When the N,S-G membrane was inserted between the catholyte and separator, the lithium-selenium (Li-Se) batteries exhibited a high reversible discharge capacity of 330.7 mAh g(-1) at 1 C (1 C = 675 mA g(-1)) after 500 cycles and high rate performance (over 310 mAh g(-1) at 4 C) even at an active material loading as high as similar to 5 mg cm(-2). This excellent performance can be ascribed to homogenous dispersion of the liquid active material in the electrode, good Li+-ion conductivity, fast electronic transport in the conductive graphene framework, and strong chemical confinement of polyselenides by nitrogen and sulfur atoms. More importantly, it is a promising strategy for enhancing the energy density of Li-Se batteries by using the catholyte with a lightweight heteroatom doping carbon matrix.

Herein, we introduce a hybrid solid electrolyte with Li7P3S11 being wrapped with polyethylene oxide-LiClO4 (PEO-LiClO4). As served as conductive bridge between Li7P3S11 particles, PEO-LiClO4 would provide Li+ transition paths between Li7P3S11 particles, thus successfully improve its ionic conductivity. Moreover, the polymer layer of PEO-LiClO4 can isolate lithium metal and Li7P3S11 solid electrolyte, suppressing the reaction between lithium electrode and Li7P3S11 electrolyte. Therefore, hybrid solid electrolyte Li7P3S11-PEO-LiClO4 shows excellent interfacial compatibility with lithium foil. Lithium-sulfur battery with the hybrid electrolyte Li7P3S11-PEO-LiClO4 exhibits much improved electrochemical performance with better cycling stability and higher Coulombic efficiency.

Fully-lithiated lithium sulfide (Li2S) is more desirable than sulfur as a high capacity cathode material because it allows the use of a variety of lithium-free anode materials. Widespread application of Li2S is hindered by severe drawbacks associated with the solubility of the intermediate charge products, and the insulating nature of Li2S. Here, we report the feasibility of utilizing Li2S with a dual-phase electrolyte separated by a lithium super ionic conductor (LISICON). With this cell architecture that enables an efficient utilization of micro-sized Li2S, the Li-S battery yields high specific capacity, Coulombic efficiency, cycling stability, and no self-discharge. A Li-ion sulfur battery with an aluminium or graphite anode is demonstrated as well in our initial proof-of-concept study.

Electrochemically pre-lithiated alpha-MoO3 is prepared to form lithium molybdate anode which was tested against mesoporous titania coated sulfur cathode. A pouch cell with a capacity of 5 mAh made using pre-lithiated lithium molybdate nanowires as anode and mesoporous TiO2 (titania) coated carbon-sulfur cathode exhibited 1.4 V operating voltage and exhibited 620 Wh kg(-1) capacity in the first cycle, dropped to similar to 400 Wh kg(-1) in 2(nd) cycle and 300 Wh kg(-1) at 100(th) cycle.

For the Pyr(14)TFSI/Co-solvent binary system, only 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) afforded stable cycling performance with reasonable Coulombic efficiency (CE). Further increase in DOL concentration leads to a higher initial capacity but deteriorated CE. In an attempt to balance CE and capacity, 2.0 M LiTFSI Pyr(14)TFSI/DOL (2:1) exhibited optimal performance in terms of initial discharge capacity of 896 mAhg(-1) and CE of 98.1% for over 200 cycle. The role of DOL and salt concentration interplay in the binary electrolyte was simulated by ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The solvation energy with varying co-solvent and LiTFSI salt concentration provides useful information when looking toward implementing other IL-based electrolyte systems for Li-S chemistry.

The material has a high specific surface area of 1347 m(2) g(-1) and is rich in macro, meso and microporous tertiary pore structures. XPS analysis shows that boron and nitrogen are successfully doped within the carbon structure. As a Li-ion battery anode, BN-3DG950 delivers high specific capacities of 1050 and 307 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.01 and 4 A g(-1) respectively. Defects caused by boron and nitrogen co-doping increases the number of available Li-ion storage sites, and the unique interconnected pore structure of the 3D graphene sheet framework enables high cycling stability with rapid electron and Li-ion transport for high rate capability.

Supercapacitor electrodes with high energy storage capability and cycle life have been developed based on both neat PANI as well as its composites with carbon or inorganic pseudocapacitors. In batteries, tailorable synthesis of PANI to confine/coat nanostructures of electroactive materials (Na+ host materials in SIBs or sulfur in LiS) has resulted in notable improvement in utilization, stability and durability of these materials due to PANI's high conductivity, specific material interaction and its ability to ameliorate stress on the nanostructures caused by large volume changes during cycling. Limitations of PANI in such electrodes are discussed and possible future directions have been proposed.

J	Long, GQ; Li, WH; Luo, WY; Chen, QQ; Zhong, Q				Long, Guoqiang; Li, Wenhua; Luo, Wanyue; Chen, Qianqiao; Zhong, Qin			Glucose-derived porous carbon as a highly efficient and low-cost counter electrode for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							THIN-FILM; PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN; COMPOSITE; SUPERCAPACITORS; FABRICATION; NANOSHEETS; BIOMASS	Biomass-derived porous carbon is widely used in supercapacitors, carbon dioxide capture and lithium-sulfur batteries owing to its advantages such as wide sources, low cost and good stability. However, it is rarely used in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Here, glucose-derived porous carbon was obtained by hydrothermal carbonization followed with high-temperature KOH activation, and employed as an efficient counter electrode (CE) for QDSCs. The CV, EIS and Tafel-polarization analysis showed that porous carbon exhibits excellent catalytic activity for reduction of S-n(2-). The CE based on porous carbon activated at 900 degrees C (C-900) presents best performance with interface charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of 2.4 omega cm(2) due to the synergy between high graphitization degree and large specific surface area. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the QDSCs assembled with a CdS/CdSe sensitized TiO2 photoanode and the C-900 CE is up to 5.61% under one sun illumination. The excellent catalytic activity of C-900 is attributed to its large specific surface area and porous structure and high degree graphitization. This suggests that glucose-derived porous carbon can become a potential low-cost and efficient CE material for QDSCs.

As the cathode of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the Co-N-C/SeS2 composite with a high Loading (66.5 wt%) of SeS2 delivers a reversible capacity of 1165.1 mA h g(-1) and an over 84.1% capacity retention of the initial capacity (970.2 mA h g(-1)) with a neatly 100% coulombic efficiency after 200 cycles. The Co-N-C/SeS2 cathode shows excellent rate performances with capacities of 760 mA h g(-1), 604.1 mA h g(-1), and 439.7 mA h g(-1) at 1C, 2C, and 4C, respectively. The redox chemistry of SeS2 is revealed by in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The superior electrochemical performance of the cathode is attributed to the unique Co-N-C structure with abundant micropores and uniformly-embedded ultrafine Co nanoparticles, which provide abundant SeS2 absorption and catalytically active sites and efficiently prevent the dissolution of polysulfides and polyselenides. The conductive Co-N-C framework facilitates fast electron and ion transfer in electrochemical reactions. Our work facilitates the development of high-performance cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Till date, most of the studies have focused on the design of the state of art S-containing composites or complex electrode architectures. However, few studies have aimed to improve the low cost sulfur cathodes using commercial sulfur powder because of the increased difficulty; moreover, few studies have investigated the effect of conductive agents on the rate ability of lithium sulfur batteries. To improve the rate ability of low cost sulfur cathodes, we propose a cheap conductive agent, namely ultrathin graphite sheet (UGS), prepared by a simple ultrasonic dispersion method to replace commercial carbon blacks. Surprisingly, we find that sulfur particles can be easily wrapped by the small UGS in the electrodes without the assistance of any surfactants or other special methods. This spontaneous wrapping can effectively improve the electrical contact between the micro-sized particles and the UGS. Benefiting from its intrinsic high electronic conductivity and ultrathin sheet structure, a more effective 3D electrical conductive network is formed, which causes the electrode to exhibit lower interphase contact resistance and charge transfer resistance. Thus, the discharge ability and the charge ability of the UGS/sulfur cathode at 1 C or higher rates are much better than that of the nanoscale carbon black/sulfur cathode. Better performance at high rates and a low cost make UGS more suitable for the low cost and high power sulfur cathode.

The as-prepared Li-S batteries using SbNs/separators exhibit much improved electrochemical performance compared to the ones using commercial separators. The coulombic efficiency (CE) of the Li-S battery using the SbNs/separator after the initial cycle is close to 100% at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1), and 660 mA h g(-1) capacity retained after 100 cycles. The rate capability of Li-S battery using SbNs/separator delivers a reversible capacity of 425 mA h g(-1) when the current density increases to 1 A g(-1). The improved electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the following reasons. Firstly, the combination of physical adsorption and chemical bonding between SbNs and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which efficiently inhibits the shuttle phenomena of LiPSs. Secondly, the good electronic conductivity of SbNs improves the utilization of the adsorbed LiPSs, which benefits the capacity release of active materials. Lastly, the fast conversion kinetics of intermediate LiPSs caused by the catalytic effect from SbNs further suppresses the shuttle effect of LiPSs. The SbNs/separators exhibit a great potential for the future high-performance Li-S batteries.

Understanding the quantitative correlation between layer number n and the critical radius R-c of the graphene cylinder will provide new insight in the fundamental science for the potential applications of graphene. In this work, the R-c(n) function of graphene layers deposited on SiO2 substrate is established with nanothermodynamics. The finding in which R-c increases linearly as n increases agrees with the experimental results. This reveals the actual mechanism of the graphene growth behavior.

A simple approach to overcome this challenge via anchoring soluble lithium-sulfur intermediate compounds on the surface of red phosphorus and configuring an efficient interface is proposed here. Sulfur is strategically incorporated into phosphorus by P-S bonding to construct a phosphorus-sulfur/carbon composite with a highly conductive interface. The soluble Li-S intermediates formed during the electrochemical lithiation process could be anchored on the surface of phosphorus by capillary action to heal the cracks/defects of phosphorus caused by volumetric expansion. Calculations based on first principles demonstrate that the strategic introduction of sulfur enables band overlapping near the Fermi level, which facilitates high efficiency electron-transfer at the P-S interface and thus improves the overall electrochemical properties of the constructed composite. Therefore, the phosphorus-sulfur/carbon composite delivers a high initial charge capacity of 1808.2 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) and maintains a reversible capacity of 935.3 mA h g(-1) with a high coulombic efficiency of approximately 99.4% after 200 cycles.

In the present first-principles study, we systematically investigated the competitions between polysulfide self-cohesion, solvation, and its anchoring strengths on substrates. The dissolution probability of polysulfides in ether-based electrolytes is evaluated by a defined solvation potential Delta PS-C, which confirms that Li2S8 is the most soluble species; the competition of Li2S8 anchoring strength on different substrates and its solvation energy is described by a stabilizing potential Delta PS-A, which can be used to verify if a certain substrate can effectively stabilize polysulfides in cathodes. Two properties for a feasible substrate, containing affinitive sites with high electron density for anchoring polysulfides and containing sufficient affinitive sites to provide multiple interactions for enhancing the stabilization, are necessarily proposed. Accordingly, phosphorylated chitosan, among several substrates, is predicted to be a promising third-party substrate to preserve polysulfides in cathodes and prevent them from being dissolved. Our computational scheme may provide a reliable procedure for rapidly screening most appropriate candidates for designing the novel architecture of sulfur cathodes.

However, the problem of Li dendrite caused by irregular Li deposition seriously hinders the development of Li metal batteries. The failure mechanisms of Li-Sulfur (Li-S) pouch cells are revealed by the electrochemical diagram. And the most immediate reason is that the growth of Li dendrites continuously consumes the active lithium and electrolyte, which leads to the pulverization of Li, and further battery failure. Herein, the nitrogen-defective graphite-like carbon nitride (NG-C3N4, or NGCN) is employed as electrolyte additive to achieve homogeneous deposition of Li metal and suppress the generation of Li dendrites. In particular, this uniform and adjustable Li deposition can optimize the electrochemical performance of symmetrical Li-NGCNI parallel to Li-NGCN cells, even at the areal capacity of 10 mAh cm(-2). Furthermore, the NGCN can achieve the co-deposition with Li-ions during the charge-discharge process to construct the in-situ NGCN coating on the surface of both cathode and anode. Therefore, the Li-NGCN-S/PC pouch cell acquires superb long-term cycling performance with a high discharge capacity of 822.1 mAh g(-1) and the capacity retention rate is 67.4% after 100 cycles.

The PPy is introduced to the surface of MWCNT by an in situ polymerization of pyrrole with FeCl3 as the oxidizing agent. The structures of the PPy-MWCNT composites are analyzed by Raman spectra. The surface area of the PPy-MWCNT composite increases with the increase of the PPy content in the composite. Adversely, the conductivity of the S/PPy-MWCNT decreases. The MWCNT provides the high electronic conductive network. Meanwhile, the PPy with high surface area ensures an uniform dispersion of the sulfur. As a result, S/PPy-MWCNT with 25 wt.% PPy shows the discharge capacity of 725.8 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unlike graphite, a stable SEI that facilitates charge transfer is rarely formed on Li in any electrolyte, and requires an "engineered" interface. The interfacial stability of Li can be improved in both liquid and solid electrolytes by thin coatings of AlF3 using atomic layer deposition.

However, poor cycle efficiency and safety concerns, which are mainly related to. dendrite Li growth during cycling, need to,be addressed. Here we propose a solution to the Li dendrite problems. We distributed chemically prepared nitrogen-doped few-layer graphene (N-FLG) sheets on Cu substrates to create island structures. The island-type FLG on the Cu electrode was prepared via spin-coating using slurries that included a polymer binder. When the electrode was used for Li deposition, Li ions were first inserted into the graphene layers. Then, Li metal nucleation occurred at the N-FLG sheets owing to their high electrical conductivity; meanwhile, an insulating polymer layer on the Cu prevented the growth of metallic Li there. Lastly, Li metal grew from the edges of N-FLG sheets in both the lateral and vertical direction, and Li metal deposits filled the gaps between the N-FLG islands as well as covering the remainder of the electrode surface. Thus, stable cycling with flat voltage profiles was demonstrated over 100 cycles at a current density of 2 mA cm(-2). The materials and electrochemical characterization results highlight the effectiveness of this method, which paves the way for the development of robust, dendrite-free Li metal electrodes.

However, the stability of F atoms on fluorinated graphene under different conditions, which is essential to maintain the desired properties of fluorinated graphene, is still unclear. In this work, we investigate the diffusion of F atoms on pristine graphene, graphene with defects, and at graphene/fluorographene interfaces by using density functional theory calculations. We find that an isolated F atom diffuses easily on graphene, but those F atoms can be localized by inducing vacancies or absorbates in graphene and by creating graphene/fluorographene interfaces, which would strengthen the binding energy of F atoms on graphene and increase the diffusion energy barrier of F atoms remarkably.

Herein, double-shelled Ni-Fe P/N-doped carbon nanoboxes (defined as Ni-Fe-P/NC) were synthesized and then applied as electrode materials for potassium ion batteries (KIBs) and Li-S batteries, first. The unique architectures could not only alleviate volume changes and prevent aggregation of Ni-Fe-P/NC during cycling but could also provide efficient surface areas for infiltration of electrolyte. Additionally, nitrogen-doped carbon could improve the conductivity of the electrode. Hence, when these Ni-Fe-P/NC nanoboxes were applied as anode materials for KIBs, they delivered enhanced cycling stability (172.9 mA h g(-1) after 1600 cycles at 500 mA g(-1) and 115 mA h g(-1) after 2600 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1)). Meanwhile, the Ni-Fe-P/NC could also be used as the sulfur host material for Li-S batteries; benefiting from its unique hollow structure, it can accommodate high sulfur loading and have strong chemical adsorption ability to polysulfides.

J	Nagata, H; Akimoto, J				Nagata, Hiroshi; Akimoto, Junji			Effective One-Step Preparation of High Performance Positive and Negative Composite Electrodes for All-Solid-State Li2S-Si Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; ION CONDUCTIVITY; HIGH-ENERGY; ELECTROLYTES; TRANSFORMATION; CONDUCTORS; GLASSES	All-solid-state lithium sulfur batteries provide higher theoretical energy density and safety performance than commercial lithium ion batteries. Combining a Li2S positive electrode with a Si-negative electrode is particularly attractive because it avoids highly reactive lithium metal. In general, the positive and negative composite electrodes are prepared by several time-consuming preparation processes. This study reports an effective one-step preparation process in which the high-performance positive and negative composite electrodes are reacted by mechanical milling of the electrode active materials, conductive carbons, and raw materials of solid electrolyte. This process simultaneously generates the solid electrolyte and a composite of electrode active materials, solid electrolyte, and carbon in the composite electrodes. Moreover, the specific surface area of carbon accelerated the generation of solid electrolyte and the compounding of the electrode active materials. The charge-discharge performances of both the Li2S positive and Si-negative composite electrodes were boosted by the high specific surface area of carbon. Furthermore, a full-battery cell using the Li2S positive and Si-negative composite electrodes achieved a high area capacity of 4.2 mAh cm(-2) and an energy density of 376 Wh kg(-1)(masses of the positive and negative composite electrodes) at 0.25 mA cm(-2) and 25 degrees C.

Herein, we systematically investigated pristine graphene and metal-N-4@graphene (metal = Fe, Co, and Mn) as host materials for sulfur cathode to adsorb NaPSs via first-principles theory calculations. The computing results reveal that Fe-N-4@graphene is a fairly promising anchoring material, in which the formed chemical bonds of Fe-S and N-Na ensure the stable adsorption of NaPSs. Furthermore, the doped transition metal iron could not only dramatically enhance the electronic conductivity and the adsorption strength of soluble NaPSs, but also significantly lower the decomposition energies of Na2S and Na2S2 on the surface of Fe-N-4@graphene, which could effectively promote the full discharge of Na-S batteries. Our research provides a deep insight into the mechanism of anchoring and electrocatalytic effect of Fe-N-4@graphene in sulfur cathode, which would be beneficial for the development of high-performance Na-S batteries.

The physical and chemical performances of the novel carbon-sulfur nano-composite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical performances of nano-composite were characterized by charge-discharge characteristic, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS). The experimental results indicate that the electrochemical capability of nano-composite material was superior to that of traditional S-containing composite material. The cathode made by carbon-sulfur nano-composite material shows a good cycle ability and a high specific charge-discharge capacity. The HSAAC shows a vital role in adsorbing sublimed sulfur and the polysulfides within the cathode and is an excellent electric conductor for a sulfur cathode and prevents the shuttle behavior of the lithium-sulfur battery.

Graphite oxide was firstly exfoliated via thermal expanding process under 1000 degrees C, then the expanded graphite was reduced by La2Ti2O7 nanosheets under UV light irradiation. The as-prepared graphene-La2Ti2O7 nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET surface area analyzer, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and UV-vis diffuse spectroscopy. The composites exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic activity for decomposition of rhodamine B (RhB) under UV-irradiation compared to pure La2Ti2O7 materials, which was attributed to the increase in the charge separation efficiency in the presence of graphene and the large surface contact between graphene and La2Ti2O7.

In this paper a conceptual review on graphene-based templates is given, highlighting their versatile roles in materials preparation. Graphene is capable of acting as a low-dimensional hard template, where its two-dimensional morphology directs the formation of novel nanostructures. Graphene oxide and other functionalized graphenes are amphiphilic and may be seen as soft templates for formatting the growth or inducing the controlled assembly of nanostructures. In addition, nanospaces in restacked graphene can be used for confining the growth of sheet-like nanostructures, and assemblies of interlinked graphenes can behave either as skeletons for the formation of composite materials or as sacrificial templates for novel materials with a controlled network structure. In summary, flexible graphene and its derivatives together with an increasing number of assembled structures show great potentials as templates for materials production. Many challenges remain, for example precise structural control of such novel templates and the removal of the non-functional remaining templates.

The active material production process employed here, exploring different sulfur-few layer graphene ratios, enabled tuning and optimization of the sample morphology, as confirmed via a scanning electron microscopy study. The results reveal that the graphene content is a crucial parameter yielding an optimized morphology of spherical particles composed of an elemental sulfur inner core covered by the carbonaceous compound. The electrodes are characterized in lithium metal half-cells in terms of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling tests, rate capability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Moreover, the lithium-ion diffusion coefficients of each sample are obtained by the Randles-Sevcik equation in order to evaluate the reliability of the electrochemical processes. The lithium metal half-cell with the sulfur carbon composite active material exploiting a spherical particle morphology delivers a high specific capacity of 950 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at C/4 with a coulombic efficiency of 98%.

Here we use S chains encapsulated in single- and double-walled carbon nanotubes as a model system and report the electrochemical behavior of 1D S chains in Li-S batteries. An electrochemical test shows that S chains have high electrochemical activity during lithiation and extinctive electrochemistry compared with conventional S8. The confined steric effect provides Li+ solid-phase diffusion access to insert/egress reactions with S chains. During lithiation, the long S chains spontaneously become short chains, which show higher discharge plateaus and better kinetics. The unique electrochemistry of S chains supplements the existing knowledge of the S cathode mechanism and provides avenues for rational design of S cathode materials in Li-S batteries.

Herein, we propose a new and efficient lithium ion battery obtained by coupling exfoliated graphite/graphene nanosheets (EGNs) anode and high-voltage, spinel-structure cathode. The anode shows a capacity exceeding by 40% that ascribed to commercial graphite in lithium half-cell, at very high C-rate, due to its particular structure and morphology as demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The Li-ion battery reveals excellent efficiency and cycle life, extending up to 150 cycles, as well as an estimated practical energy density of about 260 Wh kg(-1), that is, a value well exceeding the one associated with the present-state Li-ion battery.

Then, the prepared composite was wrapped in a thin-layered nickel-based hydroxide (NNH) to form a tree-bark-like structure. After irreversibly reacting with lithium to form a barrier layer with both good Li+ permeability and abundant functional polar/hydrophilic groups, this layer could retard the diffusion of lithium polysulfides by both physical confinement and chemisorption. As a result, the freestanding NNH/ACC/S cathode with 4.3 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading displayed a high-areal discharge capacity of 4.3 mA h cm(-2) over 100 cycles at 0.15 C. When cycled at 0.5 C, it still showed a discharge capacity of 650.0 mA h g(-1) over 350 cycles.

In this study we examine a three electrode system with a glassy carbon working electrode immersed in electrolyte solution containing elemental sulfur as reactant and 1,3-dioxolane: 1,2-dimethoxyethane with bis-triflourmethansulfonimid lithium salt electrolyte. We present essential new quantitative insights into the reaction steps occurring at the sulfur electrode of a lithium-sulfur battery during discharge. The conducted sequence of electrochemical experiments allow to study the complex phenomena with classical electrochemical methods of cyclic voltametry, open circuit potential measurements and discharge. Our experimental analysis at different states of charge reveals the important role of chemical disproportionation to cell relaxation. The reduction reactions, their reversibility and the electrode performance strongly depend on the chemical equilibrium between the polysulfides. These results allow to formulate surround experimentally validated nonformal reaction kinetic models. These give detailed information of the complex interaction of chemical and electrochemical reactions. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The good performance of SPAN in the carbonate based electrolyte indicates a material difference between SPAN and elemental sulfur/carbon composite materials. The SPAN with sulfur contents of 33.7%, 42.0% and 46.3% are prepared by control of heating time. The SPAN with sulfur content of 42.0% shows the best electrochemical performance, it can deliver stable cycling capacity over 700 mAh g(-1), and keep capacity retention over 97% after 80 cycles in the electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6/EC+DEC. The average capacity degradation rate is less than 0.03% per cycle excluding the first discharge capacity. Prototype 100 mAh Li/SPAN cell is assembled, showing energy density of 437 Wh kg(-1) excluding the weight of package and capacity retention of 90.4% after 30 cycles at 100% depth of discharge. This study demonstrates that the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile composite in the electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6/EC+DEC is a promising battery chemistry, which materials are abundant, of low cost and easily available, to fabricate Li/SPAN batteries, paving an alternative avenue to develop high performance lithium batteries for energy storage and vehicular application.

The graphene sheet models with different aspect ratios on SiO2 substrate are established and sufficiently relaxed at different thermodynamic temperatures. Subsequently, the morphology, equilibrium position and undulation of graphene on SiO2 substrate are discussed. It is observed that after sufficient relaxation processes, all the graphene sheets are adsorbed on SiO2 substrates and have some certain degree of undulations both on the edge and in the inner surface rather than perfect planar structures. Further observation from the simulation results shows that with different initial distances between the graphene sheet and SiO2 substrate, the graphene sheet would eventually stabilize to an identical equilibrium level at the same temperature. In addition, the final average distance between the graphene sheet and the substrate is a constant of 3.44 angstrom at 0.01 K, in close proximity to the value of parameter r(m), in Lennard-Jones potential function, and the higher the temperature is, the larger the final distance becomes. The results also indicate that for the same size of the graphene sheet, the increasing of temperature significantly aggravates the undulation of graphene sheet. With the increase of aspect ratios, the undulation of the graphene sheet is also aggravated, even the graphene sheet would crimp to a certain extent.

Herein, we report an integrated catalytic network comprising graphitic carbon-encapsulated/bridged ultrafine NiCoP embedded in N, P-codoped carbon (GC-uNiCoP@NPC) as a highly competent catalyst for sulfur-based species conversions. By profiling the evolution map of Li-S chemistry via operando kinetic analyses, GC-uNiCoP@NPC is demonstrated to possess versatile yet efficient catalytic activity for sulfur reduction/evolution reactions, especially the rate-determining heterogeneous phase transitions. As a result, GC-uNiCoP@NPC enables high capacity and stable cycling of sulfur cathode under high areal loading and lean electrolyte. Moreover, pouch cells assembled under practical conditions present promising performance with a specific energy of 302 Wh kg(-1). This work not only conceptually expands the catalyst design for LSBs but also provides a comprehensive insight into the catalyst performance for Li-S chemistry.

The success of Li-S cells depends in large part on the utilization of metallic Li as anode material. Metallic lithium, however, is prone to grow parasitic dendrites and is highly reactive to several electrolytes; moreover, Li-S cells with metallic Li are also susceptible to polysulfides dissolution. Here, we show that similar to 10-nm-thick two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 can act as a protective layer for Li-metal anodes, greatly improving the performances of Li-S batteries. In particular, we observe stable Li electrodeposition and the suppression of dendrite nucleation sites. The deposition and dissolution process of a symmetric MoS2 -coated Li-metal cell operates at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with low voltage hysteresis and a threefold improvement in cycle life compared with using bare Li-metal. In a Li-S full-cell configuration, using the MoS2 -coated Li as anode and a 3D carbon nanotube-sulfur cathode, we obtain a specific energy density of similar to 589 Wh kg(-1) and a Coulombic efficiency of similar to 98% for over 1,200 cycles at 0.5 C. Our approach could lead to the realization of high energy density and safe Li-metal-based batteries.

The rationally designed host framework, which combines the merits of strong chemical interaction effect, abundant catalytic active sites, and excellent conducting network, can realize efficient anchoring and fast conversion of lithium polysulfides/polyselenides during the electrochemical processes. Thus, this SeS2-based cathode shows a high initial capacity of 1013 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and an outstanding cycling stability, with a capacity of 426 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles at 2 A g(-1), corresponding to a low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle. This study demonstrates a novel and efficient approach to overcome the hurdles of current lithium-sulfur systems for stable rechargeable batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, the oxygen functional groups of chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are systematically regulated via a series of reductants and varied experimental conductions. Carboxyl and carbonyl have been proven to significantly enhance the aqueous electrolyte wettability, Zn-ion chemical adsorption, and pseudocapacitive redox activity by experimental study and computational analysis. The rGO cathode produced through hydrogen peroxide assisted hydrothermal reduction exhibits a specific capacitance of 277 F g(-1) in 1 m ZnSO4 after optimization of surface oxygen functional groups. In addition, a quasi-solid-state flexible Zn-ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC) with a polyacrylamide gel electrolyte and a high loading mass of 5.1 mg cm(-2) are assembled. The as-prepared quasi-solid state ZHC can offer a superior areal capacitance of 1257 mF cm(-2) and distinguished areal energy density of 342 mu W h cm(-2). The significant enhancement of redox activity and Zn-ion storage capability by regulating the oxygen functional groups can shed light on the promotion of electrochemical charge storage properties even beyond protic electrolyte systems.

Nonetheless, their kinetics arrearage and detrimental "shuttling effect" caused by the migration of soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates severely limit its practical application. Here, by a nonthermal route sulfur is in-situ imprisoned into Co/N-codoped hollow carbon sphere (NC-Co) to construct an integrated S/C-Co-N hollow cathode (S@NC-Co) and directly applied in Li-S batteries, which effectively avoids complex template removal and sulfur infiltration process. The hollow NCCo sphere not only restricts polysulfides migration via physical confinement but also enhances polysulfides conversion through redox-active electro-catalysis. Moreover, the hollow structure has large cavity offering sufficient space to accommodate volume expansion and excellent conductivity promising efficient electron/charge transfer. As a result, the batteries assembled by the S@NC-Co cathode achieve low polarization and high-rate capability (551 mAh g-1 at 4C). Remarkably, the batteries also present an outstanding long-term durability over 800 cycles at 1C, in which the capacity attenuation is merely 0.06 % per cycle. This work demonstrates a novel strategy in designing hierarchical structures or nanore-actors for electrochemical reactions and energy storage systems. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we report the promising results of transition-metal disulfides as an anchoring material and the underlying origin for preventing active material loss from the electrode using density functional theory calculations. Group 5 and 4 disulfides (VS2, NbS2, TaS2, TiS2, ZrS2, and HfS2) in particular show anchoring capabilities superior to those of group 6 disulfides (CrS2, MoS2, and WS2). The governing interaction controlling the latter relative anchoring strengths is shown to be charge transfer as understood by crystal-field theory. The current findings and methodologies provide novel chemical insight for the further design of inorganic anchoring materials for both lithium-selenium and lithium-sulfur batteries.

By exploiting the combined advantages of holes and graphene, holey graphene based materials have attracted significant interest due to their exceptional properties such as high electrical conductivity and high surface area. These remarkable properties have enabled holey graphene based materials to outperform its pristine form (graphene) and demonstrate their applicability in versatile fields including electrical energy storage (supercapacitors and Li-ion, Li-air, Li-S and Na-ion batteries), energy conversion (electro-water splitting and dye-sensitized solar cells), water desalination, bioseparation, fuel cells, gas sensors, and hydrogen storage and dye degradation systems. As a consequence, it is important to uncover the prime properties and the related potential industrial implications of holey graphene based materials for the development of further research. Hence, in the review, the properties of emerging holey graphene-based materials and various applications including principles, design, fabrication, and engineering aspects are discussed in detail. The recent advances in the state-of-the-art hole generation methods for graphene-based materials along with their working mechanisms, associated issues/solutions, and possible future are discussed. Additionally, the review is aimed at providing critical views on the current status and prospects and generating novel ideas for the development of holey graphene-based materials as a formidable candidate for versatile applications.

Species of defects have important influence on rate performance of metal-sulfur electrodes. However, catalytic reaction mechanisms have not been explored in depth. This paper focuses on comparing differences between intrinsic defect carbon materials (IDC) and external introduced defect carbon materials (EIDC) in promoting polysulfide redox abilities and exploring catalytic redox reaction mechanism deeply. Results show that IDC have stronger catalytic redox reaction abilities than EIDC, which is mainly due to stable C-S bonds on surface of IDC. After cycling, C-S bond contents in IDC electrodes maintain more than 70 %. During cycling process, C-S bonds can quickly adsorb polysulfides and promote their conversion into final products, thereby achieving high rate performance. Weak catalytic redox abilities of EIDC electrodes is mainly due to loss of C-S bonds. When the current density is 5C, capacities of IDC electrodes is twice as much as that of EIDC electrodes.

Compared with the traditional lithium-sulfur battery, the replacement of lithium metal with prelithiated SiOx/C anode and the use of commercial carbonate-based electrolyte ensure the high safety of the new battery. Meanwhile, the lithium-ion sulfur battery also possesses the advantage of high energy density. It delivers a high reversible capacity of 616 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles with an average working voltage of about 1.6 V, corresponding to a high energy density of 661 W h kg(-1), which is more than double that of the commercial lithium-ion batteries. The fabrication of the lithium-ion sulfur battery provides an effective way to solve the safety problems of the available lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the constituent electrocatalysts and the sulfur reactants have vastly different molecular sizes, which ultimately restrict electrocatalysis efficiency and hamper device performance. Herein, the authors report that aggregates of cobalt single-atom catalysts (SACs) attached to graphene via porphyrins can overcome the challenges associated with the catalyst/reactant size mismatch. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the Co atoms present in the SAC aggregates exist as single atoms with spatially resolved dimensions that are commensurate the sulfur species found in sulfur cathodes and thus fully accessible to enable 100% atomic utilization efficiency in electrocatalysis. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the Co SAC aggregates can interact with the sulfur species in a synergistic manner that enhances the electrocatalytic effect and promote the performance of sulfur cathodes. For example, Li-S cells prepared from the Co SAC aggregates exhibit outstanding capacity retention (i.e., 505 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C after 600 cycles) and excellent rate capability (i.e., 648 mA h g(-1) at 6 C). An ultrahigh area specific capacity of 12.52 mA h cm(-2) is achieved at a high sulfur loading of 11.8 mg cm(-2).

In this paper, sulfur composite has been synthesized by heating a mixture of elemental sulfur and activated carbon, which is characterized as high specific surface area and microporous structure. The composite, contained 70% sulfur, as cathode in a lithium cell based on organic liquid electrolyte was tested at room temperature. It showed two reduction peaks at 2.05 V and 2.35 V, one oxidation peak at 2.4 V during cyclic voltammogram test. The initial discharge specific capacity was 1180.8 mAh g(-1) and the utilization of electrochemically active sulfur was about 70.6% assuming a complete reaction to the product of Li2S. The specific capacity still kept as high as 720.4 mAh g(-1) after 60 cycles retaining 61% of the initial discharge capacity. (C) 2009 Ren Jie Chen.

Improving the Durability and Minimizing the Polysulfide Shuttle in the Li/S Battery	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Li-SM3 Conference	APR 26-27, 2017	London, ENGLAND				LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIALS; CARBON; ELECTROLYTE; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITES; INTERLAYER; SYSTEMS; CELLS	The effect of surfactants and protective interlayers (commercial carbon paper and homemade mixed-conduction composites) on the electrochemical performance of sulfur batteries has been studied. Modification of cell configuration by the insertion of Toraycarbon paper between the cathode and separator improved the utilization of the active material and increased the initial discharge capacity from 800 to 1400 mAh/gS. The latter is about 84% of the theoretical value. The use of a few-micron-thick PEO-PVP-XC72 or SWCNT-PVP interlayer composites, cast on the cathode or separator, resulted in a similar positive effect on the initial sulfur utilization. The cells that were assembled in the discharge state and contained carbon interlayers exhibited a faradaic efficiency (FE) of above 99%, while the FE of the cells with the unprotected cathode is 95-96%. High faradaic efficiencies confirm the functionality of protective interlayers, which minimizes the polysulfide shuttle. Analysis of the impedance spectra of the conventional and modified cells shows that the SEI resistance decreases by about 50% and the apparent thickness of the SEI becomes smaller in the interlayer-protected cells. The cells with ultrathin composite layers hold the 30% capacity gain induced by the barrier for at least 400 cycles. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

Indeed, diethylene-glycol dimethyl-ether (DEGDME) and triethylene-glycol dimethyl-ether (TREGDME) dissolving lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in concentration approaching the solvents saturation limit are used in lithium batteries employing either a conversion sulfur-tin composite (S:Sn 80:20 w/w) or a Li+ (de)insertion LiFePO4 cathode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) clearly show the suitability of the concentrated electrolytes in terms of process reversibility and low interphase resistance, particularly upon a favorable activation. Galvanostatic measurements performed on lithium-sulfur (Li/S) batteries reveal promising capacities at room temperature (25 degrees C) and a value as high as 1300 mAh g(S)(-1) for the cell exploiting the DEGDME-based electrolyte at 35 degrees C. On the other hand, the lithium-LiFePO4 (Li/LFP) cells exhibit satisfactory cycling behavior, in particular when employing an additional reduction step at low voltage cutoff (i.e., 1.2 V) during the first discharge to consolidate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This procedure allows a Coulombic efficiency near 100%, a capacity approaching 160 mAh g(-1), and relevant retention particularly for the cell using the TREGDME-based electrolyte. Therefore, this work suggests the use of concentrated glyme-based electrolytes, the fine-tuning of the operative conditions, and the careful selection of active materials chemistry as significant steps to achieve practical and safe lithium-metal batteries.

However, problems remain in enhancing the energy density and improving the cycle life. We present a free-standing structure of walnut-shaped VS4 nanosites combine with carbon nanotubes (NTs) as cathodes. In this framework, NT arrays provide high surface area and conductivity for high sulfur loadings, and VS4 nanosites facilitate trapping and catalytic conversions of lithium polysulfides. The synergistic effects of free-standing NT arrays and VS4 nanosites have enabled high rate capability up to 6 C and longterm cycling with a low decay rate of 0.037% up to 1200 cycles at 2 C. Moreover, the designed cathode can achieve high areal capacities up to similar to 13 mAh.cm(-2) and estimated gravimetric energy density of 243.4 Wh.kg(-1) at a system level, demonstrating great potential in practical applications of Li-S batteries.

Highly efficient and stable cryo-ground sulphur cathode for Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium-sulphur battery; Sulphur cathode; Cryogenic grinding; Li-ion batteries		Here we report on a Li-S battery with cathode, based on a S powder obtained from bulk amorphous S, by cryogenic grinding. The cathode was prepared from a slurry, wherein the content of cryo-ground S powder was equal to 80 wt % (corresponds to approximate to 2.26 mg cm(-2)). Other slurry components included carbon Super P, and polyvinylidene fluoride, dispersed in N-methylpyrrolidone. The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared battery was compared to a battery based on an identically prepared paste, but containing reference S powder (with the orthorhombic structure). A longer life cycle, and enhanced capacity per gram, as well as per cm(2) of electrode was revealed for the cryo-ground S-based cathode. The electrochemical results show that the loss in capacity of the cryo-ground S powder cathode was just 3% after 50 cycles, which suggests on a higher stability of S inside the cathode during cycling.

However, to realize their wide-scale commercial use, a high sulfur fraction is essential for the sulfur cathode. It is well known that the binder has a direct impact on the properties of the sulfur cathode. In this paper, gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) was adopted as a functional binder in Li-S batteries. With plentiful electron-rich groups (amide, carboxyl) in the PGA molecular chain, the shuttle effect was restrained, and a good conductive network was formed. It was found that batteries using PGA as a binder exhibited better electrochemical cycling performance and rate capability compared to batteries using LA132, a common binder in sulfur cathodes. Even the PGA cathode contained a high sulfur mass fraction (77 wt%), the discharge capacity still remained 659 mA h g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency of around 99% after 200 cycles at 0.5C.

Seeds were treated with graphene solutions at different concentrations. Obvious delaying effects on the germination rate were observed with the increasing of graphene concentration. The growth of radicle and plumule was inhibited. And also, the morphology (root length, stem length, adventitious number, root fresh weight, fresh weight of over ground part and root cap ratio) of rice seedlings was certainly affected. After been treated by different concentrations of graphene for 16 d, promoting effects on adventitious root number, root fresh weight and fresh weight of over ground part were observed at concentration of 5 mg/L. Significant inhibitions on the stem length and fresh weight of over ground part were observed at concentration of 50 mg/L. In addition, all the indexes were inhibited at concentrations of 100 mg/L and 200 mg/L. It indicates that graphene certainly inhibit the morphogenesis of rice seedlings. But the mechanism by which graphene of 5 mg/L improves part of growth indexes still needs further study.

The intrinsic linear transport properties (S-parameters) of the graphene sample are measured and extracted via a deembedding procedure and then fitted with an equivalent circuit model up to 10 GHz. A statistical uncertainty analysis based on multiple measurements is implemented to estimate the error of the extracted graphene linear parameters as well. Nonlinear properties (second-and third-order harmonics as a function of fundamental input power) of the sample are also measured with a fundamental input signal of 1 GHz. Clear harmonics generated from graphene are observed, while no obvious fundamental power saturation is seen. The measured nonlinearity is applied in a graphene patch antenna case study to understand its influence on potential applications in terms of third-order intermodulation levels.

J	Chang, CH; Chung, SH; Manthiram, A				Chang, Chi-Hao; Chung, Sheng-Heng; Manthiram, Arumugam			Highly flexible, freestanding tandem sulfur cathodes for foldable Li-S batteries with a high areal capacity	MATERIALS HORIZONS			English	Article							PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODE	Li-S batteries with a high theoretical capacity are considered as the most promising candidate to satisfy the increasing demand for batteries with a high areal capacity. However, the low sulfur loading (< 2 mg cm(-2)) and poor flexibility of current Li-S batteries limit their application in establishing foldable Li-S batteries with a high areal capacity. To solve this problem, we employ here a freestanding flexible tandem sulfur cathode with a remarkably high sulfur loading to demonstrate foldable, high-areal-capacity Li-S batteries. The design of the tandem cathode readily increases the sulfur loading and effectively retards the migration of polysulfides. Therefore, the Li-S cell employing the tandem cathode exhibits a high initial areal capacity of 12.3 mA h cm(-2) with stable cycling stability even with a high sulfur loading of up to 16 mg cm(-2). These tandem cathodes are promising for foldable Li-S cells with a high areal capacity and energy density.

Fundamental role of Fe-N-C active sites in a CO2-derived ultra-porous carbon electrode for inhibiting shuttle phenomena in Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; OXYGEN REDUCTION; PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN; MEMBRANE; CATHODE; CO2; ELECTROCATALYST; CONDUCTIVITY; SEPARATOR	The homogeneous distribution of electrochemical catalysts in a carbon material with an ultrahigh pore volume and large surface area is a promising strategy for rapid conversion of lithium polysulfides to minimize the shuttle phenomenon. This work utilizes a porous carbon material produced via facile CO2 conversion to achieve both the confinement of sulfur and the uniform distribution of Fe-N-C sites. It also seeks to dope more N atoms and increase porosity through a unique method of bubbling an ammonia solution, which increases the density of the Fe-N-C catalytically active sites and forms additional pores, providing numerous pathways for more efficient diffusion of Li ions. The increased pore volume maximizes the kinetics of polysulfide conversion through synergy with the catalysts distributed over the high surface area of the resulting product. DFT calculations elucidate the fundamental role of the Fe-N-C catalyst in terms of the energy reduction associated with the lithium polysulfide conversion process and enhanced Li-ion diffusion dynamics. The assembled cell exhibits a capacity of 590 mA h g(-1) up to 150 cycles at a high current density of 7.0C, and a maximum areal capacity of 3.54 mA h cm(-2) is delivered at 1.0C for a high sulfur amount of 4.3 mg cm(-2).

Surface Reactivity of Lithium (Poly)sulfides in a Polarizable Environment from First Principles	TOPICS IN CATALYSIS			English	Article; Early Access						Li2S batteries; DFT; Superficial catalysis; Solvent effects	LI2S CATHODES; SULFUR; MECHANISMS; BATTERIES; GRAPHENE; POINTS	The present work deals with a first principles comparative study of the decomposition of Li2S and different polysulfides on graphitic surfaces in different dielectric media. This work aims at contributing to the understanding of the reactions that take place during the charging of a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery in different solvents. The barrier for the Li-S bond breakage is determined using the nudged elastic band method, and a detailed analysis of the atomic charges along this pathway is performed. The role of the solvent is found to be twofold: on one side, increasing the environment dielectric constant lowers the energy barrier for the decomposition of the polysulfides. On the other hand, it weakens the interaction energy of the adsorbates on the surface. These two effects are opposite. While the first effect is expected to increase the reaction rate, the second one will contribute to decreasing the concentration of poly(sulfide) species on the surface. The present results also suggest that the rate determining step for the overall oxidation process of Li2S to S-8 is changed by the nature of the solvent.

Herein, we successfully prepare porous carbon with a large surface area (3175 m(2) g(-1)) and an ultrahigh carbon purity (carbon atom ratio of 98.25%) via templating carbonization coupling with KOH activation. As-synthesized MTC-KOH exhibits excellent performances as supercapacitor electrode materials in terms of high specific capacitance and ultrahigh cycling stability. In a three electrode system, MTC-KOH delivers a high capacitance of 275 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and still 120 F g(-1) at a high rate of 30 A g(-1). There is almost no capacitance decay even after 10,000 cycles, demonstrating outstanding cycling stability. In comparison, pre-activated MTC with a hierarchical pore structure shows a better rate capability than microporous MTC-KOH. Moreover, the constructed symmetric supercapacitor using MTC-KOH can achieve high energy densities of 8.68 Wh kg(-1) and 4.03 Wh kg(-1) with the corresponding power densities of 108 W kg(-1) and 6.49 kW kg(-1), respectively. Our work provides a simple design strategy to prepare highly porous carbons with high carbon purity for supercapacitors application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compared with the pristine graphene, the porous DGNs display much more outstanding capacitive behaviors. An electrode based on the DGNs shows an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 256 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 148 F g(-1) even at 20 A g(-1). In addition, hierarchical carbon nanotubes@NiO (CNT@NiO) core-shell hybrids were fabricated via a facile chemical bath deposition method, followed by thermal annealing. The resulting CNT@NiO electrode shows a considerable specific capacitance of 1000 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). For the first time, an advanced asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was successfully fabricated consisting of a porous DGN-based negative electrode and a hierarchical CNT@NiO core-shell nanosheet-based positive electrode. The device exhibits a high specific capacitance of 108 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and an excellent cycling stability, with 93.5% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles at 6 A g(-1). Due to its unique microstructures, the CNT@NiO//DGNs ASC device displays a supreme energy density of 38.1 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 500 W kg(-1) and even retains an energy density of 16.2 W h kg(-1) at 16 000 W kg(-1) (voltage window of 1.6 V). These results indicate that our ASC device is extremely valuable for energy storage applications and predict future trends toward the realization of graphene-based materials used in supercapacitors.

It is reported that in situ synthesized ultrasmall vanadium nitride nanoparticles dispersed on porous nitrogen-doped graphene (denoted VN@NG) as a catalytic interlayer solves this problem. The ultrasmall size of VN particles provide ample triple-phase interfaces (the reactive interfaces among VN nanocatalyst, NG conductive substrate, and electrolyte) for accelerating LiPS conversion and Li2S deposition, which greatly reduces the accumulation of LiPSs in the electrolyte and therefore inhibits the shuttle effect. Their high catalytic activity is confirmed by a reduced activation energy of the Li2S4 conversion step based on temperature-dependent cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements and the reduced shuttle effect is detected by in situ Raman spectra. With the VN nanocatalyst, Li-S batteries have an outstanding cycling performance with a low capacity decay rate of 0.075% per cycle over 500 cycles at 2 C. A high capacity retention of 84.5% over 200 cycles at 0.2 C is achieved with a high sulfur loading of 7.3 mg cm(-2).

Among the many affected areas of materials science, this ` graphene fever' has influenced particularly the world of electrochemical energy-storage devices. Despite widespread enthusiasm, it is not yet clear whether graphene could really lead to progress in the field. Here we discuss the most recent applications of graphene both as an active material and as an inactive component - from lithium-ion batteries and electrochemical capacitors to emerging technologies such as metal-air and magnesium-ion batteries.

Operando Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering: An Appropriate Tool to Characterize Sulfur in Li-S Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ABSORPTION-SPECTROSCOPY; EMISSION-SPECTROSCOPY; IN-SITU; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; DIFFRACTION; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISM; SPECIATION; SPECTRA	Application of new analytical tools providing insight into the mechanism of lithium-polysulfide formation in the cathode and their interaction with the host matrix and electrolyte is essential for further development of Li-S batteries. In this work, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements at the sulfur K-edge were performed on the Li-S battery in operando mode to study the lithium-polysulfide formation during the discharge process. The relative amounts of each sulfur compound in the cathode during the discharge process were determined from the linear combination fit using reference spectra measured on standard sulfur compounds. Because of resonant excitation condition the sensitivity for the lithium-polysulfide detection was significantly enhanced, while the sulfate signal from the electrolyte was heavily suppressed. In addition, the influence of self-absorption effects in the analysis was minimized due to fixed excitation energy. Consequently, a full quantitative analysis could be performed for the conventional Li-S battery consisting of sulfur-carbon composite cathode free from any additives and a LiTFSI based electrolyte.

Multifunctional bio carbon: a coir pith waste derived electrode for extensive energy storage device applications	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							ORDERED MESOPOROUS CARBON; LITHIUM ION BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL CAPACITANCE; ANODE MATERIALS; COCONUT SHELL; LOW-COST; NITROGEN; PERFORMANCE; NANOSHEETS; NANOFIBERS	As a sequel to our earlier findings on the suitability of coir pith derived carbon (CPC) in lithium-ion and lithium sulfur batteries, the extended suitability of CPC electrode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) has been demonstrated through the present work. Herein, the activation temperature of CPC plays a vital role and an optimum temperature of 850-C is found to be essential to demonstrate superior electrochemical performance in sodium-ion batteries and the product is denoted as CPC-850. An initial capacity of 280 mA h g(-1) and a progressive capacity of 220 mA h g(-1) up to 300 cycles with negligible capacity fading have been observed at 50 mA g(-1). Furthermore, CPC850 delivers-1 10 mA h g(-1) for 1000 cycles at 1 A g(-1) and demonstrates tolerance up to 5 A g(-1), corresponding to 13.44C rate. In EDLCs, a CPC-850 symmetric cell exhibits 191 F g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) current density. Notably, CPC-850//CPC-850 withstands rated currents such as 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g(-1) and delivers 168, 152, 150 and 128 F g(-1) up to 10 000 cycles. Hence, the multifunctional capability and versatile suitability of the CPC electrode in electrochemical energy storage devices could be understood.

J	Pu, X; Yang, G; Yu, CH				Pu, Xiong; Yang, Gang; Yu, Choongho			Trapping Polysulfides Catholyte in Carbon Nanofiber Sponges for Improving the Performances of Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM/SULFUR BATTERIES; LI-S BATTERIES; ELECTROLYTE; NANOTUBES; CATHODE; IMPROVEMENT; MOLECULES	Practically viable Li-S batteries necessitate improvement of their poor cycling performances arising from polysulfide shuttle and associated irreversibility as well as reduction of non-active conductive additives. Here we greatly alleviated the problems by utilizing freestanding carbon nanofiber (CNF) sponges as both catholyte reservoir and porous conductive framework in cathode. The pores in the sponge effectively held liquid-type polysulfide catholyte without noticeable aggregation of sulfur products during cycling, resulting in excellent capacity retentions up to similar to 90% in 300 cycles at 0.5-C rate. More importantly, polysulfide deposition and dissolution were studied by measuring impedance spectra at seven different stages during the first charge and discharge cycle, revealing the polysulfide redistribution upon cycling and limited kinetics at the fully discharged state due to the deposition of solid Li2S2/Li2S. Detailed investigation of the effects of catholyte concentration and volume was also conducted to optimize the battery performances. Considering that the sponge strueture was synthesized by using a facile one-step chemical vapor deposition method, our approach has a great potential in developing practically viable Li-S batteries.

However, lithium metal anodes suffer from destructive dendrite formation, which causes safety concerns. Anodes with high capacity and safe handling are needed. The sulfurized carbon anode from polyacrylonitrile (S-C(PAN)) composite has been used as a cathode in lithium sulfur batteries. Instead, when the S-C(PAN) is used as an anode and paired with LMO, the full cell delivers an energy density of 185 Wh kg((s.c (PAN)+LMO))(-1) at 1 C within the voltage range from 1 to 3.2 V. The full cell (S-C(PAN)parallel to LMO) is characterized by a reversible discharge capacity of 1378 mAh g(-1) s and 868 mAh g(-1) s at 0.1 C and 2 C, respectively. At 1 C, a retention capacity of 807 mAh g(-1) s is achieved at the 400th cycle with an average decay rate of 0.7 mAh g(-1) s*cycle(-1) and average coulombic efficiency of 99.5%. Interfacial chemistry of S-C(PAN) anode is particularly investigated and S-C(PAN) is demonstrated as one interesting anode material, alternative to lithium metal, due to its high theoretical capacity of sulfur (1675 mAh g(-1)), environmental friendliness, low cost, and high energy density.

Then a lightweight and flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/GN composite was prepared by a vacuum infiltration method by using the graphene network as a template. The composite showed the superior electrical conductivity of 6100 S/m even at a very low loading level of graphene (1.2 wt %). As a result, an outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) of around 40 and 90 dB can be achieved in the X-band at thicknesses of 0.25 and 0.75 mm, respectively, which are much higher than most of the conductive polymers filled with carbon. The 3D graphene network can also act as a mechanical enhancer for PDMS. With a loading level of 1.2 wt %, the composite shows a significant increase by 256% in tensile strength.

The cathode is characterized in a lithium-metal cell employing a solution of LiCF3SO3 salt in dioxolane-dimethylether (DOL: DME) as the electrolyte. The detailed NMR investigation of the diffusion properties of the electrolyte is reported in order to determine its suitability for the proposed cell. The addition of LiNO3 to the electrolyte solution allows its practical application in a lithium sulfur cell using an Li2S-C-based cathode characterized by a specific capacity of about 500 mA h g(-1) (with respect to the Li2S mass). The cell holds its optimal performances for over 70 cycles at a C/5 rate, with a steady state efficiency approaching 99%. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the cell upon operation suggest the reversibility of the Li2S electrochemical process, while the repeated electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements indicate the suitability of the electrode-electrolyte interface in terms of low and stable cell impedance. Furthermore, the EIS study clarifies the activation process occurring at the Li2S cathode during the first charge process, leading to a decrease of cell polarization during the following cycles. The data reported here shed light on important aspects which should be considered for the efficient application of a Li2S cathode in lithium batteries.

This situation not only disables the adsorbing host from controlling the dissolved PSs, but also terminates electrochemical redox when the mass transport and electron transfer are completely blocked by the non-conductive layer. Here, we present that single-atom Co is of significance to control the epitaxial deposition of solid sulfides to promote spherical cumulative deposition with 3D morphology. On the carbon paper (CP), the deposition shows the lateral deposition mode with a much lower capacity. On the single-atom Co decorated carbon paper (CoSAs-CP), it shows the spherical cumulative deposition mode with a high capacity reaching up to its theoretical value. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that single-atom Co can reconstruct the electronic structure of solid intermediates owing to the d-p hybridization associated with an electron feedback coupling mechanism, which benefits the non-locality of electrons and octahedron-tetrahedron fields of solid intermediates, promoting both the electron transfer and Li transport of longitudinal deposition to balance the lateral deposition so as to sustain the spherical epitaxial deposition.

The results showed that among four kinds materials, the methyl orange's degradation rate of Ag/Graphene/TiO2 in simulated visible light reached best, whose degradion was 4.25 times that of pure TiO2. The number of photocatalytic experiments showed that Ag/Graphene/TiO2 photogenerated electrons and the corresponding generated O-2 center dot dominated the catalysis.	[Li, S. Y.; Feng, J.

Great efforts are being made to develop solid electrolytes or safer alternative battery chemistries, among which Zn-based batteries stand out for their high energy density and good compatibility with aqueous electrolyte. Theoretically, Zn-air batteries have very high volumetric energy density, which is similar to 85% of that of Li-S batteries. However, Zn anodes have poor cycling performance because of their passivation (insulating discharge product ZnO) and dissolution (soluble zinc species in alkaline electrolytes) problems. In this work, we overcome these problems by modifying Zn anode with graphene oxide (Zn@GO) by a facile solution casting method. The GO layers on the Zn surface can deliver electrons across insulating ZnO, slow down the Zn intermediates from dissolving into the electrolyte, and thereby enhance the utilization and rechargeability of Zn anodes. As a result, the Zn@GO anode containing only 1.92 wt% GO showed improved cycling performance compared to that of the unmodified Zn mesh. The accumulated areal discharge capacity of the Zn@GO anode is 128% of that of the unmodified Zn mesh. The Zn@GO anode reported here can potentially be paired with oxygen cathode to form safe high-energy rechargeable batteries, and be used in large scale applications, ranging from electric vehicles, to grid-scale energy storage. The surface modification method reported here can also potentially be applied to other high-capacity electrodes that undergo passivation or dissolution issues. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

They exhibited high specific capacities of approximately1000 mA hg(-1) (based on S) after 100 cycles and coulombic efficiencies great than 98%, significantly better than undoped graphene paper (GP). These NGP were characterized with XRD, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, AFM, electron microscopy, and Raman and impedance spectroscopy before and after cycling. Spectroscopic evidence suggested stronger binding of sulfide to NGP relative to GP, and modelling results from DFT calculation, substantiated with experimental data, indicated that pyrrolic and pyridinic N atoms interacted more strongly with Li polysulfides than quaternary N atoms. Thus, more favorable partition of polysulfides between the electrode and the electrolyte and the corresponding effect on the morphology of the passivation layer were the causes of the beneficial effect of N doping.

Here, FeS micro-flowers are synthesized by hydrothermal treatment and are wared and grafted into layer-by-layer carbon nanotubes (CNT). Subsequently, FeS@Fe2O3/CNT composite films are obtained by annealing, during which the FeS micro-flowers are partially oxidized to core-shell FeS@Fe2O3 micro-flowers. The FeS@Fe2O3/CNT composite electrodes exhibited high reversible capacity of 1722.4 mAh g(-1) (at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1) after 100 cycles) and excellent cycling stability (545.1 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1) after 600 cycles) as self-supporting anodes. The prominent electrochemical performances are attributed to the unique reciprocal overlap architecture. This structure serves as a cushion to buffer large volume expansion during discharge/charge cycles, and ameliorates electrical conductivity. Due to their good specific capacity and cycle stability, these FeS@Fe2O3/CNT films have high potential application value to be used as high-performance anodes for lithium-ion, lithium sulfur and flexible packaging batteries.

In this article, we report a polyhedral carbon framework, which can evolve from a solid to hollow structure through rational design. Thanks to a good hollow, porous and thin shell structure, the material can be used for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) and lithium/sodium ion batteries. For the lithium/sodium storage process, the capacity can be stabilized at 333.3 mA h g(-1) (1000)/150.4 mA h g(-1) (2000), even at a high current density of 10.0 A g(-1). In addition, this unique material can also be used to modify commercial PP separators, which provides huge benefits to LSBs. The synergistic adsorption of polysulfides is achieved through physical/chemical interactions. It can provide a 625.4 mA h g(-1) reversible capacity after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1.0C, and the capacity decay rate is as low as 0.046%. At the same time, this excellent cycle stability can be maintained under extremely high sulfur loading conditions.

One-step chemical vapor deposition synthesis and supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped porous carbon-carbon nanotube hybrids	BEILSTEIN JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						bimetallic catalyst; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; N-doped carbon; porous carbon-carbon nanotube hybrid; supercapacitor	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; RAY PHOTOELECTRON-SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTROCHEMICAL CAPACITORS; N-2 MOLECULES; ION BATTERIES; GRAPHENE; TEMPERATURE; OXIDE; NANOPARTICLES; NANOMATERIALS	Novel nitrogen-doped carbon hybrid materials consisting of multiwalled nanotubes and porous graphitic layers have been produced by chemical vapor deposition over magnesium-oxide-supported metal catalysts. CNx nanotubes were grown on Co/Mo, Ni/Mo, or Fe/Mo alloy nanoparticles, and MgO grains served as a template for the porous carbon. The simultaneous formation of morphologically different carbon structures was due to the slow activation of catalysts for the nanotube growth in a carbon-containing gas environment. An analysis of the obtained products by means of transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy methods revealed that the catalyst's composition influences the nanotube/porous carbon ratio and concentration of incorporated nitrogen. The hybrid materials were tested as electrodes in a 1M H2SO4 electrolyte and the best performance was found for a nitrogen-enriched material produced using the Fe/Mo catalyst. From the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data, it was concluded that the nitrogen doping reduces the resistance at the carbon surface/electrolyte interface and the nanotubes permeating the porous carbon provide fast charge transport in the cell.

Study of sulfur-based electrodes by operando acoustic emission	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Acoustic emission; Positive electrode formulation; Mechanical properties	ION BATTERIES; CARBON PAPER; COMPOSITES; MECHANISM; CHARGE	The mechanical degradation upon cycling of sulfur-based electrodes is investigated by operando acoustic emission (AE). The AE response of S-based electrodes using two different binders, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), as well as two different current collectors, usual aluminum foil and porous non-woven carbon paper (CP), are compared. In all cases, AE signals are mainly detected during the 1st plateau of the 1st discharge, related to the initial dissolution of elemental sulfur into the electrolyte, causing a collapse of the electrode network. At the end of charge, the formation of micrometric sulfur on the surface of the electrode can be acoustically detected, in particular in the case of the CMC/Al formulation, where signals are also detected during subsequent cycles. This is believed to be a result of the good adhesion of CMC-based electrode to the current collector, which allows acoustic waves to propagate through the electrode to the AE sensor more easily. However, with CP current collector, no AE activity is detected upon charge, reflecting a lower mechanical stress attributed to a more homogeneous growth of the S particles in the electrode. It is also noted that inefficient electrode formulation/elaboration can be detected via AE, as AE signals are emitted at the end of the discharge when the cell polarizes more than usually observed. The use of CP as a current collector greatly improves the electrochemical performance of the cells, especially when combined with the better adhesion/cohesion strengths of CMC binder, reaching an initial capacity of 1180 mAh g(-1) (similar to 4.5 mAh cm(-2)) stabilizing around 860 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles.

Though they offer very high theoretical capacity, their poor volumetric energy density as compared to conventional Li-ion batteries and polysulphide dissolution in the electrolyte hinder it to be used in practical application. In this work, we have attempted to solve these issues by creating an alloy of sulfur and selenium by co-melting. The alloy, in the form of composite with reduced graphene oxide, was used further as a cathode in the Li-S/Se battery. The creation of an S-Se alloy improves the bonding between S and Li with the presence of Se due to dipolar interactions of S-Se and Li. This prevents polysulphide dissolution and gives a stable capacity of 800 mA h g(-1) for more than 100 cycles. The high density of the alloy resulted in high areal loading of electroactive material (6.5 mg/cm(2)).

Metal-Sulfur Battery Cathodes Based on PAN Sulfur Composites	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTRICAL ENERGY-STORAGE; POLYACRYLONITRILE/GRAPHENE COMPOSITE; LITHIUM BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; CYCLE; POLYSULFIDE; ELECTROLYTE; DENSITY	Sulfur/polyacrylonitrile composites provide a promising route toward cathode materials that overcome multiple, stubborn technical barriers to high-energy, rechargeable lithium sulfur (Li-S) cells. Using a facile thermal synthesis procedure in which sulfur and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) are the only reactants, we create a family of sulfur/PAN (SPAN) nanocomposites in which sulfur is maintained as S-3/S-2 during all stages of the redox process. By entrapping these smaller molecular sulfur species in the cathode through covalent bonding to and physical confinement in a conductive host, these materials are shown to completely eliminate polysulfide dissolution and shuttling between lithium anode and sulfur cathode. We also show that, in the absence of any of the usual salt additives required to stabilize the anode in traditional Li-S cells, Li SPAN cells cycle trouble free and at high Coulombic efficiencies in simple carbonate electrolytes. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis of the SPAN cathodes at various stages of charge and discharge further show a full and reversible reduction and oxidation between elemental sulfur and Li-ions in the electrolyte to produce Li2S as the only discharge product over hundreds of cycles of charge and discharge at fixed current densities.

Moreover, the ionically/electronically conductive matrix achieves accelerated redox conversion of the PSs and effective regulation for the nucleation/growth of lithium sulfide.

Traditional protective clothing can protect the human body from physical injury. It is highly desirable to integrate modern wearable electronics into a traditional protection suit to endow it with versatile smart functions. However, it is still challenging to integrate electronics into clothing through a practical approach while keeping the intrinsic flexibility and breathability of textiles. In this work, we realized the direct writing of laser-induced graphene (LIG) on a Kevlar textile in air and demonstrated the applications of the as-prepared Janus graphene/Kevlar textile in intelligent protective clothing. The C=O and N-C bonds in Kevlar were broken, and the remaining carbon atoms were reorganized into graphene, which can be ascribed to a photothermal effect induced by the laser irradiation. Proof-of-concept devices based on the prepared graphene/Kevlar textile, including flexible Zn-air batteries, electrocardiogram electrodes, and NO2 sensors, were demonstrated. Further, we fabricated self-powered and intelligent protective clothing based on the graphene/Kevlar textile. The laser-induced direct writing of graphene from commercial textiles in air conditions provides a versatile and rapid route for the fabrication of textile electronics.

Electronically sulfur is highly insulating, and therefore integration of a conducting framework such as a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold with sulfur is a key aspect of the cathode design. Despite numerous efforts dedicated to S-CNT cathode development, increasing sulfur loading to above 1 mg/cm(2) while maintaining the cycling stability of the Li-S cell remains challenging. This could be partly due to the lack of understanding of the spatial distribution of sulfur in the CNT matrix and its location with respect to the morphology of the CNT scaffold. We demonstrate herein that the sulfur has a hierarchical distribution in the CNT cathode at high sulfur loading (>5 mg/cm(2)) spanning multiple length scales (from nanometer to submillimeter). Sulfur infiltration into the CNT rather than the sulfur loading plays a key role in determining the redox reaction kinetics, Li+ ion diffusion, and the galvanostatic cycling capacity and stability of Li-S cells. This study provides new insights for the design and fabrication of high loading, binder-free sulfur-carbon-based cathode architectures for next-generation high energy Li-S batteries.

Pressure-Induced Capillary Encapsulation Protocol for Ultrahigh Loading of Sulfur and Selenium Inside Carbon Nanotubes: Application as High Performance Cathode in Li-S/Se Rechargeable Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							COMPOSITE CATHODE; SURFACE-TENSION; LITHIUM; BEHAVIOR; CONFINEMENT; MECHANISM; CAPACITY	There has been a paradigm shift in research foci toward elemental electrodes from the conventional intercalation compound-based electrochemical storage. Replacing intercalation transition metal (oxide) compounds with elemental cathodes (e.g., sulfur, oxygen) theoretically raises the storage capacities by more than one order in magnitude. The insulating nature and complexities of the redox reaction associated with electroactive elements necessitates their housing inside an electronic conductor, which has been mainly carbon. Efficiency of the electrochemical storage using such elemental electrodes, besides depending on factors related to the electrolyte, solid-state diffusion, mainly depends on characteristics of the carbon host. We report here a novel, simple, and efficient pressure-induced capillary encapsulation protocol for the confinement of chalcogens, sulfur (5) and selenium (Se), inside carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Confinement led to lowering of the surface tension of molten S/Se, resulting in superior wetting and ultrahigh loading of the CNTs. Higher than 95% of the CNTs is loaded, and very high loading, nearly 85% of S/Se inside the CNTs, is achieved. When assembled at a very high areal loading (similar to 10 mg cm(-2)) in the Li-S/Se battery, the S/Se-CNT cathodes exhibited very stable cyclability and high values of specific capacity at widely varying operating current densities (0.1-10 C-rates).

The major challenges associated with the sulphur cathodes are structural degradation, poor cycling performance and instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase caused by the dissolution of polysulfides during cycling. Tremendous efforts made by others have demonstrated that encapsulation of S materials improves their cycling performance. To make this approach practical for large scale applications, the use of low-cost technology and materials has become a crucial and new focus of S-based Li-ion batteries. Herein, we propose to use a low temperature spraying process to fabricate graphene/S electrode material, where the ink is composed of graphene flakes and the micron-sized S particles prepared by grinding of low-cost S powders. The S particles are found to be well hosted by highly conductive graphene flakes and consequently superior cyclability (similar to 70% capacity retention after 250 cycles), good coulombic efficiency (similar to 98%) and high capacity (similar to 1500 mA h g(-1)) are obtained. The proposed approach does not require high temperature annealing or baking; hence, another great advantage is to make flexible Li-ion batteries. We have also demonstrated two types of flexible batteries using sprayed graphene/S electrodes.

Also, the sulphur cathode was encapsulated with carbon nanoparticles with a S@C core-shell structure using a solvent-free coating process. The chemical interaction between the imine group of the quinoid ring in the PANI structure and the polysulphides reducing the shuttle effect as well as the high electrical conductivity and less volume change of the carbon encapsulated sulphur can provide high-performance Li-S@C core-shell batteries.

Integrating the visible-light-absorption experiments, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) observations, and current -voltage (I-V) measurements, the rGO-TiO2 composites have been demonstrated to possess the advantages of both rGO and TiO2, i.e., superior conductivity from rGO and strong ability of anchoring polysulphides from TiO2. These advantages can reduce the polarisation voltage and enhance the capacity performance of the corresponding cells. Consequently, the cells display the initial capacity of 1145 mA h/ g and reversible capacity of 760 mA h/g after 100 cycles at 0.5C, and the latter is approximately 52% higher than that of the cells with pristine separators. In addition, the cells provide satisfactory rate capability and high sulphur areal-loading. The rGO-TiO2 separator exhibits significant potential to enhance the performance of Li-S batteries.

However, maintaining high charge cycle stability is a key challenge for Li-S batteries due to the shuttle effect. Here we show highly stable characteristics with 100% charge capacity of Li-S batteries with 500 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C and 3 C charge rates. This was made possible by the combination of laser synthesised sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) doped graphene electrodes (without a binder) with molybdenum sulphide (MoS2) nanoparticle loading. The N/S doped porous graphene structure presented enhanced interface adsorption by the production of -SO2, which suppressed diffusion of polysulfide into the electrolyte through promoting oxygen-containing functional groups chemically bonding with sulfur. A low electrolyte resistance, interphase contact resistance and charge-transfer resistance accelerate electrons and Li+ transport by laser induced N/S doped graphene.

The synthesis of active material composites from CD resources can enable or enlarge the effective utilization of these products in the battery industry with some economical as well as environmental benefits. New and simple strategies are here presented for the synthesis of nanostructured silicon and sulfur composite materials with carbonized hyper cross-linked CD (nanosponges) that show satisfactory performance as high-capacity electrodes. For the sulfur cathode, the mesoporous carbon host limits polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects and guarantees stable cycling performance. The embedding of silicon nanoparticles into the carbonized nanosponge allows to achieve high capacity and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area of the silicon composite, the characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility, opening a detailed analysis on the behavior of the material in different electrolytes. We show that the use of commercial LP30 electrolyte causes a larger capacity fade, and this is associated with different solid electrolyte interface layer formation and it is also demonstrated that fluoroethylene carbonate addition can significantly increase the capacity retention and the overall performance of our nanostructured Si/C composite in both ether-based and LP30 electrolytes. As a result, an integration of the Si/C and S/C composites is proposed to achieve a complete lithiated Si-S cell.

J	Xia, JZ; Cao, R; Wu, Q				Xia, Jiezhen; Cao, Rong; Wu, Qi			Transition metal decorated phthalocyanine as a potential host material for lithium polysulfides: a first-principles study	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; SULFUR BATTERIES; ENERGETICS; GRAPHENE; COHP	The shuttle effect caused by the soluble long-chain lithium polysulfides greatly hinders the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Therefore, the introduction of suitable anchoring materials is more effective to mitigate this problem. Transition metal phthalocyanines (TMPc) are regarded as a new class of sulfur host materials. Here, 4d transition metal (Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd) decorated phthalocyanines are designed and systematically researched for the performance analysis of anchoring S-8/LiPSs by first-principles calculations. The results reveal that the bonding strength of LiPSs can be well adjusted by introducing suitable 4d transition metals into the phthalocyanine structure. The electronic structure analysis indicates the formation of TM-S bonds between the TMPc substrate materials and the LiPSs, which is essential to weaken the Li-S bonds and hence slow down the shuttle effect of LiPSs. ZrPc and NbPc both exhibit excellent potential and thermal stability for facilitating the conversion of LiPSs, as well as a better promoting effect for the sulfur reduction reactions (SRR) with a reduced Gibbs free energy in the rate-determining step (*Li2S2 -> *Li2S) during the discharge reaction process. These findings in our work may encourage further experimental and theoretical research for anchoring LiPSs with TMPc as a host material.

Herein, we prepare a highly graphitized and Fe/N enriched carbon tube (Fe/N-g-CT) as multifunctional host. It is found that the introduction of Fe can efficaciously promote the transformation from amorphous carbon sheets to graphitized carbon tubes (CT), while the residual Fe species embedded in CT can act as catalytic active sites along with the doped heteroatoms. Specifically, Fe sites can accelerate the inter-conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides, while the doped-N heteroatoms can promote the deposition of Li2S. Consequently, Fe/N-g-CT catalytic mediums synchronously improve the conductivity and reaction kinetics of sulfur electrodes, and Fe/N-g-CT/S cathode exhibits a high initial specific capacity (1500.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and a low fading rate (0.06% per cycle at 2 C over 500 cycles). Moreover, even with high sulfur loading (4.5 mg cm(-2)) and lean electrolyte consumption (E/ S = 5 mL mg(-1)), a satisfactory areal capacity of 5.1 mAh cm(-2) can also be achieved. This paper raises a good strategy or idea to boost the development and commercialization application of LieS battery with high performance through reasonably constructing sulfur host with high conductivity and catalysis activity.

However, scalable synthesis of ultrathin carbon nanosheets with well-defined pore architectures remains a great challenge. Herein, the first synthesis of 2D hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets (2D-HPCs) with rich nitrogen dopants is reported, which is prepared with high scalability through a rapid polymerization of a nitrogen-containing thermoset and a subsequent one-step pyrolysis and activation into 2D porous nanosheets. 2D-HPCs, which are typically 1.5 nm thick and 1-3 mu m wide, show a high surface area (2406 m(2) g(-1)) and with hierarchical micro-, meso-, and macropores. This 2D and hierarchical porous structure leads to robust flexibility and good energy-storage capability, being 139 Wh kg(-1) for a symmetric supercapacitor. Flexible supercapacitor devices fabricated by these 2D-HPCs also present an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 8.4 mWh cm(-3) at a power density of 24.9 mW cm(-3), which is retained at 80% even when the power density is increased by 20-fold. The devices show very high electrochemical life (96% retention after 10000 charge/discharge cycles) and excellent mechanical flexibility.

Featured with high conductivity and large flexibility, the rGO constructs a conductive three-dimensional (3D) backbone with rich porosity and leads to a free-standing, binder-free cathode for lithium tellurium (Li-Te) batteries with excellent electrochemical performances. The cathode shows a high initial capacity of 2611 mAh cm(-3) at 0.2 C, a high retention of 88% after 200 cycles, and a high rate capacity of 1083 mAh cm(-3) at 10 C. In particular, the 313 aerogel cathode delivers a capacity of 1685 mAh cm(-3) at 1 C after 500 cycles, showing pronounced long-cycle performance at high current density. The performances are attributed to the well-defined flexible 3D architecture with high porosity and conductivity network, which offers highly efficient channels for electron transfer and ionic diffusion while compromising volume expansion of Te in charge/discharge. Owing to such advantageous properties, the reported 3D rGO/tellurium nanowire (3DGT) aerogel presents promising application potentials as a high-performance cathode for Li-Te batteries.

The electrochemical performance of microsized Li2S is impaired, however, by its low electrical conductivity as well as first cycle high activation potential problem. In this work, microsized Li2S powder had been ball-milled with different carbon sources to synthesize Li2S-C composites as well as to find the suitable carbon sources, which were then capillary-deposited in three-dimensional multi-layered Ni foam from a dioxolane-containing mixture to fabricate a binder-free Li2S-C composite cathode. A large amount of active material (similar to 5 mg/cm(2)) was loaded in each cathode with the help of conventional capillary deposition method. Scanning electron micrographs show that the Li2S-C composite successfully fills the pores in the Ni foam through capillary action and maintains the integrity of the structure before and after cycling performance. Electrochemical performance testing shows that the capillary-deposited binder-free Li2S-C composite showed excellent cycling performance along with superior rate capability. For further improvement of electrochemical performance, a single-walled carbon nanotube free-standing layer was inserted in between the cathode and the separator which minimized polysulfides shuttle phenomenon thus improved the discharge capacity and the capacity retention.

However, the cycle life mainly suffers from dendrite and continuous SEI formation in lithium anodes inducing active material and electrolyte depletion. Here, we report on a silicon-carbon composite anode as a stable alternative anode for safe Li-S cells. Well-defined sulfur coatings generate a shell for a silicon core (Si@S) to further form a carbon shell (Si@S@sucrose). After sulfur removal the void structure (Si@void@C) allows to compensate the mechanical stress imposed by the huge volume change during the lithiation of the silicon. In this case, sulfur is not only used as a low cost and high capacity cathode material but also as a template to create free volume. It is easily removed during the pyrolysis and no acid leaching steps are required. In half cell tests vs. lithium a high capacity of 2270 mA h g si(-1) (690 mA h g(-1)) was achieved in the 10th cycle and the reversible lithiation of the silicon particles could be ensured for more than 50 cycles. The prelithiated Si-C anode with a high areal capacity of 2 mA h cm(-2) was successfully matched with a sulfur cathode in a SLS full cell on coin cell and on pouch cell levels. A high capacity of about 807 mA h g(sulfur)(-1) (2nd cycle) was reached with a low lithium excess of only 76% compared to 2000% lithium excess in state-of-the-art Li-S cells.

However, the crucial problems, including serious Li dendrite growth, undesired side reactions and infinite volume changes, are still big challenges for Li metal anodes, which can not only lead to the low Coulombic efficiency, but also can create short circuit risks. In this paper, we propose a novel and universal approach to achieve long life time and dendrite-free Li metal anodes by introducing carbon paper (CP) as an interlayer. As a result, the as-designed electrodes can deliver extremely high capacity (up to 3 mA h cm(-2) and 5 mA h cm(-2)), superior stable performances (620 h/265 cycles with 3 mA h cm(-2)) and high operational current densities (3 mA cm(-2) and 5 mA cm(-2)). Meanwhile, the electrodes also can demonstrate high capacity and long life time in full cells using carbon-coated LiFePO4 (C/LiFePO4) as the cathode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and molecular layer deposition (MLD) coated C/S as cathode for Li-S batteries. These new findings could open a new window for the fabrication of safe, long life time and dendrite-free Li metal anodes.

Fostering the versatile utilization of industrial effluents and residual lignin from traditional biorefineries has become an imminent issue to be tackled. A green and tandem approach was proposed to simultaneously produce carbon dots (CDs), fermentable sugar, and lignin-installed lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells from eucalyptus with the aid of l-cysteine-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment. The total yield of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) reached up to 50.16% (w/w) of xylan that was directly extracted from the wood skeleton by a moderate acidic hydrothermal environment, including 22.03% of XOS with a low degree of polymerization (DP 2-6). The graphite N, S-doped CDs with a bright blue fluorescence, which mainly originated from the irregular conjugation of xylan, lignin and l-cysteine, had an average diameter at 4.7 nm confined to a quasi-spherical shape. The proper alleviation of amorphous ingredients and recalcitrant intercellular structure can be attributed to autohydrolysis with the assistance of an amino acid, thereby fostering the enzymatic digestibility of well-preserved cellulose from 15.1% to 82.4%. From cellulose enzymatic lignin (CEL) capable of high abundance of beta-aryl ether and hydroxyl groups, a hierarchically structured heteroatom-doped biochar with exposed active sites (N, S, O-induced intrinsic defects and surface states) was synthesized via using a dual-template. It can serve as an available candidate for the molten sulfur host to install a Li-S cathode that retained 582 mA h g(-1) at 1C after 300 cycles with the average coulombic efficiency and capacity decay per cycle being 93.79% and 0.098% respectively. With the advent of bioethanol techniques, the all-round pathway brings a graceful prelude for boosting the revenue of waste-free biorefineries that has inspired application-worthy products from biomass waste streams, including photoluminescent CDs and rechargeable Li-S cells.

Regulating intermediary polysulfide dissolution by understanding the metamorphosis is essential for realizing stable and high-energy density Li S batteries. As of yet, a clear consensus on the basic surface/interfacial properties of the sulfur electrode has not been achieved, although the catalytic phenomenon has been shown to result in enhanced cell stability. Herein, we present evidence that the polysulfide shuttle in a Li S battery can be stabilized by using electrocatalytic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Physicochemical transformations at the electrode/electrolyte interface of atomically thin monolayer/few-layer using a combination of spectroscopic and microscopic analysis techniques. Preferential adsorption of higher order liquid polysulfides and subsequent conversion to lower order solid species in the form of dendrite-like structures on the edge sites of TMDs have been demonstrated. Further, detailed electrochemical properties such as activation energy, exchange current density, rate capabilities, cycle life, etc. have been investigated by synthesizing catalytically active nanostructured TMDs in bulk quantity using a liquid-based shear-exfoliation method. Unveiling a specific capacity of 590 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C rate and stability over 350 cycles clearly indicates yet another promising application of two-dimensional TMDs.

Hollow CoP nanoparticles embedded in Two-Dimensional N-doped carbon arrays enabling advanced Li-SeS2 batteries with rapid kinetics	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Li-S batteries; Cobaltphosphide; Catalyst; Conversion; Nucleation	SELENIUM SULFIDE; SUPERIOR LITHIUM; SULFUR; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; MECHANISM; SES2	Selenium sulfide has been regarded as very promising alternatives to partially address the issues of Li-S batteries due to their better electrical conductivity than sulfur cathode; however, the serious dissolution of intermediate polyselenides and polysulfides still brings about the fast capacity decay and low coulombic efficiency in Li-SeS2 batteries. Here, a flexible electrode composing of hollow CoP nanoparticles embedded in two-dimensional nitrogen doped carbon arrays supported on carbon cloth were employed as SeS2 immobilizers for the first time. The integrated host not only provides a high adsorption ability for lithium polysulfides/polyselenides (LiPSs/LiPSes) through the unique physical confinement and strong chemical immobilization, but also facilitate the fast diffusion of LiPSs and LiPSes on the surface of CoP catalyst. It was demonstrated through the microstructural, chemical, and electrochemical characterization, CoP catalyst can greatly promote the nucleation of LiPSs and LiPSes, and fast convert into insoluble products. DFT calculations and ex-situ XPS measurements can interpret the fundamental mechanism for the fast polysulfide/polyselenide conversion. Therefore, our elaborate designed architecture and surface chemistry of CoP-N/C@CC with a high SeS2 loading of 2.6 mg cm(-2) exhibit a large specific discharge capacity of 1026 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), high Coulombic efficiency, good rate capability, and excellent cycling performance with a reversible capacity of 778 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) after 300 cycles. Our work will give contributes to the research community to rationally encapsulate SeS2 cathodes with unique hosts and architectures, providing fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanism in Li-SeS2 batteries.

We compare the electrochemical performance of Li-S cells fabricated using non-porous (CNFs), micro-porous (mi-CNFs), and micro-mesoporous carbon nanofibers (me-CNFs) as sulfur hosts. me-CNFs/S cathodes exhibit a stable specific capacity with 83% capacity retention at C/2 after 200 cycles and 90% retention at C/5 after 150 cycles, whereas mi-CNFs/S and CNFs/S cathodes retain close to only 30% capacity after 200 cycles. We investigate the role of porosity using two approaches - Li+ diffusion coefficient and shuttle-current measurements. The me-CNFs/S cathodes show a relatively higher Li+ ion diffusion coefficient during reduction and oxidation processes thus indicating a low concentration of BPD-S-x(2-) species in the electrolyte. Furthermore, the me-CNFs/S cathodes indicate a relatively lower shuttle effect compared to the other two cathodes, further validating the presence of a lower concentration of polysulfides in the electrolyte. Based on the size of the BPD-S-x(2-) complex, we infer that the use of mesoporous CNFs is essential for achieving long-term cycling. Our results show that the integration of suitable porous host materials with functional electrolyte additives presents a promising approach for developing high-performance Li-S batteries.

The discharge process of the sulfur cathode could be divided into two discharge regions. These are the first discharge region (2.5-2.05 V) where the reduction of elemental sulfur to form soluble polysulfides and further reduction of the soluble polysulfides occurs, and the second discharge region (2.05-1.5 V) where the soluble polysulfides are reduced to form a Li2S solid film covered over the carbon matrix. It was found that the EIS can distinguish the individual contributions of charge transfer resistances, ion diffusion impedance and properties originating from Li2S film in the frequency domain of 100 kHz to 100 mHz. During the upper voltage plateau, the impedance of interfacial charge transfer dominates the reduction reaction. while during the lower voltage plateau, the mass transport in the cathode is a control step. It was also proved that the solid Li2S appeared at the beginning of the lower voltage plateau region and became denser during the following discharge process. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The as-prepared carbon materials showed enhanced electrochemical performance, combining electrical double-layer capacitance with pseudocapacitance owing to the doping with sulfur and nitrogen. The specific capacitance of the obtained carbon material reached 135 F g(-1) at current density of 1 A g(-1), which is much higher than undoped chitosan (67 F g(-1)). The capacitance retention of the carbon material was almost 97.2% after 5000 cycles at current density of 1 A g(-1). With such improved electrochemical performance, the nitrogen/sulfur-codoped carbon material may have promising potential for use in energy-storage electrodes of supercapacitors.

The key question is how to balance the GHG emission and the overall performance of the recycled cathodes. Many techniques have been tried to address the issue, but the GHG-performance dilemma remains to be overcome. Here we provide a route of sphagnum uptake of spent LIBs cathode toward high performance lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery, which may settle the infeasibility of ternary cathode recycling via industrial applicable processes. As-prepared cathode benefits from both chemical stabilization and hierarchical structural encapsulation, hence grants high S ratio (similar to 80%) and good specific capacity (similar to 700 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles). Eventually, this mute realizes an unprecedented negative GHG emission and achieves about 230% specific capacity higher than others.

Introducing protuberant spacers is a straightforward strategy to avoid the stacking of graphene nanosheets, resulting in a novel unstacked double-layer templated graphene (DTG) structure. Herein, a family of layered double hydroxides were used for the bulk chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of DTG in a fluidized-bed reactor. A high specific surface area of 1554.2 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 1.70 cm(3) g(-1) were achieved. When used as the electrode material for supercapacitors, the DTG afforded a specific capacitance of 65.5 F g(-1) at a sweep rate of 5.0 mV s(-1) and a capacitance retention of 77% when the sweep rate was increased to 500 mV s(-1). Therefore, the DTG obtained via fluidized bed CVD is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.

GO dispersion with a high concentration of 6 mg ml(-1) was chosen to form GO hydrogel, followed by chemical reduction to derive a free-standing reduced GO (rGO) film. According to the x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, it has a [0 0 1] crystalline orientation in the film thickness direction. The rGO film has a densely stacked laminated structure and highly anisotropic characteristic of electrical conductivities. The light-weight rGO wire also demonstrates its excellent flexible and fire-retardant characteristics. Stress-strain measurements revealed the mechanical properties of the GO film can got further improved after chemical reduction. Electrical transport measurement indicates that rGO film exhibit semiconducting behavior with negative temperature coefficient characteristic. A temperature dependence of the conductivity from 20 to 297 K reveals that the carrier transport mechanism is thermally activated band conduction above 200 K and three-dimensional (3D) Mott's variable range hopping below 100 K. The parameters such as a density of the localized electron states and a localization length of the wave function have been determined from the plot of conductivity versus (versus) temperature.

Graphene thermally grown on a vicinal substrate contains two following regions: atomically flat terraces and nanofacets (atomically stepped slopes). The graphene film at a nanofacet is continuously connected between two neighboring terrace films. Anisotropic transport properties are clearly observed, indicating a difference in the graphene properties of the two regions. The observed anisotropic properties are discussed in terms of the effects of nanofacet structures on conductivity and electron mobility.

Followed by a reduction reaction, the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) coated on glass fiber was obtained. Finally, the reduced graphene oxide-glass fibers (RGO-GF) were combined with unsaturated resins. The interfacial morphology of reduced graphene oxide-glass fibers was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The structure of the materials was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The crystal phases of the material were identified by X - ray diffraction (XRD). The mechanical properties and electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of the sample were tested. The results showed that the interface between glass fibers and graphene binds more closely after the glass fibers was treated by KH550. The tensile strength of the RGO-GF composites reached 85.05MPa. Compared with the GF composites, it increased by 51.4% when the glass fibers content was 30%. The shielding effectiveness of the composites reached 21.3dB at the frequency range of 8.2-12.4GHz (x-band). Therefore, by coating the surface with reduced graphene oxide, the glass fibers can make a great shielding effect on the electromagnetic wave. [GRAPHICS] .

The exquisite N-C conductive network not only provides sufficient free space for the volume expansion during the phase transition of solid sulfur into lithium sulfide but also reduces Rd of SMN. During cycling, the soluble polysulfide could be fastened by the silicate with an oxygen-rich functional group and heteronitrogen atoms through chemical bonding, enabling a confined shuttle effect. The synergistic effect between N-C and SMN could also effectively facilitate the interconversion between lithium polysulfides and Li2S, reducing the potential barrier and accelerating the redox kinetics. With an areal sulfur loading of 2 mg/cm(2), the S-SMN@C cathodes demonstrate a high initial capacity of 1204 mA.h/g at 0.1 degrees C, and an outstanding cycle stability with a capacity fading rate of 0.0277%, ranging from the 2nd cycle to the 1000th cycle at 2 degrees C.

Electrochemical and compositional characterization of solid interphase layers in an interface-modified solid-state Li-sulfur battery	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ION CONDUCTORS; ELECTROLYTES; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; NANOTUBES; IMPEDANCE; INSIGHTS; DENSITY; CATHODE; SR	The Li(+)transport kinetics at the solid-solid electrode|electrolyte interfaces are crucial for the stable and durable performance of solid-state batteries (SSBs). A poor interface due to mechanical problems and/or (electro-)chemical instabilities will curtail the performance of such batteries. Herein, we present a detailed study on the interfaces of a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) SSB with a Li anode, Li-garnet (LLZO) solid electrolyte (SE), and a sulfur-carbon composite as the cathode. Interlayer gels based on ionic liquids were introduced to improve the interfacial properties of the system. For Li symmetric cells, the strategy resulted in a decrease in cell resistance by about a factor of five and stable voltage profiles with low overpotentials (similar to 300 mV at 0.4 mA cm(-2)after >450 hours). Furthermore, the LLZO SE efficiently blocked the polysulfide shuttle to the Li anode. Due to the advantageous features of the design, good electrochemical performance was obtained, where the Li-S SSB delivered an initial discharge capacity ofca.1360 mA h g(sulfur)(-1)and a discharge capacity ofca.570 mA h g(sulfur)(-1)after 100 cycles. Detailed electrochemical and compositional characterization of the interphase layers was performed at the Li anode and sulfur cathode interfaces through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), applying depth-profiling techniques, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The results revealed the presence of interphase nano-layers with varying thicknesses on the LLZO surface which contained organic and inorganic species.

However, the batteries experience the polysulfide shuttle effect in cathode and dendrite growth in the Li metal anode. Herein, a bifunctional and tunable mesoporous carbon sphere (MCS) that simultaneously boosts the performance of the sulfur cathode and the Li anode is designed. The MCS homogenizes the flux of Li ions and inhibits the growth of Li dendrites due to its honeycomb structure with high surface area and abundance of nitrogen sites. The Li@MCS cell exhibits a small overpotential of 29 mV and long cycling performance of 350 h under the current density of 1 mA cm(-2). Upon covering one layer of amorphous carbon on the MCS (CMCS), an individual carbon cage is able to encapsulate sulfur inside and reduce the polysulfide shuttle, which improves the cycling stability of the Li-S battery. As a result, the S@CMCS has a maximum capacity of 411 mAh g(-1) for 200 cycles at a current density of 3350 mA g(-1). Based on the excellent performance, the full Li-S cell assembled with Li@MCS anode and S@CMCS cathode shows much higher capacity than a cell assembled with Li@Cu anode and S@CMCS cathode.

Due to strong interaction between Li and O atom, two stable Li decorated structures have relatively high Li binding energies of 3.84 and 3.04 eV, which could eliminate the clustering problem for Li atoms on PG surface. One doped Li atom could hold five H-2 molecules and the binding energy of each H-2 is above 0.2 eV. The interaction of H-2 molecules with Li atom results from charge exchange between H-2's sigma orbital and Li's 2s orbital. In the final structure with two Li-O groups in one carbon pore, a hydrogen storage capacity of 9.43wt. % could be achieved. By the combination of the advantage of Li decoration and oxidized porous graphene, Li-OPG possesses remarkable geometric stability and high hydrogen storage capacity.

However, difficulties in preparing GO-covered holey carbon EM grids have limited their widespread use. Here, we report a simple and robust method for covering holey carbon EM grids with GO sheets and demonstrate that these grids can be used for high-resolution single particle cryo-EM. GO substrates adhere macromolecules, allowing cryo-EM grid preparation with lower specimen concentrations arid provide partial protection from the air-water interface. Additionally, the signal of the GO lattice beneath the frozen-hydrated specimen can be discerned in many motion-corrected micrographs, providing a high-resolution fiducial for evaluating beam-induced motion correction.

Mesoporous Ketjen Black (KB) and carbon nanotube (CNT) are added as conductive agents to provide the three-dimensional electric channels. This method can reduce the size of the sulfur particles, thus the nanosized sulfur obtained can fully contact with the conductive agent, which could increase the utilization of sulfur and improve the capacity of Li-S batteries. Moreover, CTS with abundant hydroxyl and amine groups has strong interaction with polysulfides, which can improve the stability of Li-S batteries. As a result, the obtained CTS/C-S cathode containing 76 wt% sulfur delivers an impressively initial discharge specific capacity of 1141.6 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) at 0.5 C and maintains a capacity of 842.3 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) after 300 cycles. Our finding paves a way for the rational design of high-performance sulfur cathodes for advanced Li-S batteries.

Here we show by introducing graphene to generate heterogeneous interfaces into an amorphous alloy, the mechanical and tribological performance can be noticeably enhanced. The interfacial limiting effect of graphene on the amorphous layer greatly improves the load bearing ability of amorphous/graphene nanolaminates (AGNs). Besides, the mechanical and tribological performance of AGNs is largely dependent on the thickness of amorphous layer. Atomistic mechanism shows that the amorphous/graphene interface is not only the wall hindering the expansion of shear bands but also the percolation path of the shear transition zone (STZ) for plastic development. In particular, the high rebound ability of graphene enables a remarkable self-healing effect in AGNs during nanoscratching. Present study not only fills the gap in the theoretical research of mechanics and tribology of AGNs but also provide valuable information for the design of AGNs as one kind of surface protective materials.

Due to their low density, high surface area and high thermal stability, COFs have found interesting applications in many fields, including molecular adsorption and separation, sensing, catalysis and optoelectronics devices. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) COFs have attracted increasing attention in energy fields. In this perspective, the applications of 2D COFs in energy storage (lithium ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, supercapacitor and fuel cells) and energy conversion (water splitting and reduction of carbon dioxide) are reviewed. In addition, we will also discuss the remaining challenging issues.

The graphene surface plasmon (GSP) resonance mechanism mainly originates from the contribution, that the periodical structure can provide strong coupling of GSP modes into the incident light field, which can enhance GSP resonance and the local field. And consequently, it facilitates the tuning of the patch modes by changing Fermi energy, carrier mobility, and superstrate refractive index, respectively. We can control precisely the resonant wavelengths, field enhancement, and lifetime of the patch GSP modes by using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and coupled mode theory (CMT). The sensitivity is described by varying the refractive index of the superstrate. The theoretical descriptions and data fitting of lifetime of GSP modes are useful for graphene application.

An anode-free architecture that bypasses the need for anode host materials can deliver an elevated energy density. However, the poor efficiency of K plating/stripping on potassiophobic anode current collectors results in rapid K inventory loss and a short cycle life. Herein, commercial Al foils are decorated with an ultrathin graphene-modified layer (Al@G) through roll-to-roll plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. By harnessing strong adhesion (10.52 N m(-1)) and a high surface energy (66.6 mJ m(-2)), the designed Al@G structure ensures a highly smooth and ordered K plating/stripping process. Consequently, during K-metal plating/stripping, Al@G can operate at a current density of up to 4.0 mA cm(-2) and cyclic capacity of up to 4.0 mAh cm(-2), with an ultralong lifespan of up to 1000 h at 0.5 mA cm(-2) and stable cycling of up to 750 h under periodic current fluctuations of 0.1-2.0 mA cm(-2). In addition, a novel anode-free K-metal full-cell prototype enabled by Al@G anode current collectors is constructed, demonstrating ameliorative cyclic stability.

We herein design fully integrated hierarchical double-shelled Co9S8@CNT hollow nanospheres as a sulfur host, where each shell owns a tri-layer sandwich structure and six functional layers are constructed in total. Uniquely, the hierarchical structures integrate the beneficial functions of electrical conductivity, ion diffusion, polysulfide immobilization and polysulfide redox kinetics. The Co9S8@CNT/S delivers a reversible specific capacity of 1415 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, which is very close to the theoretical capacity of sulfur. Moreover, even at a high rate of 10C, an unprecedented capacity of 676.7 mA h g(-1) can still be achieved, which represents the best rate capability among the ever-reported sulfur cathodes with similar sulfur content. More importantly, the Co9S8@CNT/S also displays a high coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% and an excellent cycling performance for up to 1000 cycles with a capacity fading rate of only 0.0448% per cycle. Even at the loading amount of 5.5 mg cm(-2), the areal capacity can still reach 4.3 mA h cm(-2). The concept to rationally integrate distinct components into fully functional units could provide valuable insights for the development of Li-S batteries and beyond.

J	Bhargav, A; Wu, M; Fu, YZ				Bhargav, Amruth; Wu, Min; Fu, Yongzhu			A Graphite-Polysulfide Full Cell with DME-Based Electrolyte	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; HIGH-CAPACITY; SALT ELECTROLYTE; CARBON PAPER; LI; CATHODE; PERFORMANCE; INTERCALATION	Over the last decade, vast improvements have been made in the field of lithium-sulfur batteries bringing it a step closer to reality. In this field of research, deep understanding of the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon and their affinity with carbons, polymers and other hosts have enabled the design of superior cathodes with prolonged life. However, the anode side has undergone comparatively less transformation. In this work, we have developed a new electrolyte based on 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) solvent that enables reversible intercalation of lithium ions in graphite. A novel method to introduce solid lithium polysulfide into a carbon current collector as the cathode has been demonstrated and the electrode shows stable cycling with the new electrolyte. A full cell consisting of a lithiated graphitic anode and lithium polysulfide cathode is constructed, which exhibits an initial capacity as high as 1,500 mAh g(-1) (based on the sulfur in the cathode) and a reversible capacity of 700 mAh g(-1) for 100 cycles. This full cell is capable of delivering over 460 mAh g(-1) at rates as high as 2C. The cell degradation over prolonged cycles could be due to the polysulfide shuttle which results in instability of the SEI layer on the graphitic anode. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.

In this prospective, we demonstrate how analytical electron microscopy can be employed as a powerful tool to explore the origins of the enhanced capacity retention. We analyze morphological and compositional features when the copolymers, with DIB contents up to 50% by mass, are blended with carbon nanoparticles. Replacing the elemental sulfur with the copolymers improves the compatibility and interfacial contact between active sulfur compounds and conductive carbons. There also appears to be improvements of the cathode mechanical stability that leads to less cracking but preserving porosity. This compatibilization scheme through stabilized organosulfur copolymers represents an alternative strategy to the nanoscale encapsulation schemes which are often used to improve the cycle life in high-energy density Li-S batteries.

Given this much larger energy density than present cathode materials show, selenium nanofiber and its composites with the conducting polymer polypyrrole as well as with graphene have been prepared and electrochemically tested as cathode materials for Li-batteries. At a low current rate of C/120, pure t-Se electrode delivers the theoretical specific capacity, which subsequently drops to 100 Ah kg(-1) at C/20. As expected, composite formation with polypyrrole and graphene improves the electrochemical performance compared to trigonal selenium (t-Se) fibers. While polypyrrole coating minimizes the polarization between charging and discharging, graphene wrapping enhances the obtainable capacity at moderate cycling rates. Ex-situ X-ray diffraction of the electrode reveals solid solution behavior in the initial stages of lithiation, finally leading to an electrochemical conversion of selenium to Li2Se.

The results show that SNC can be well dispersed on graphene after mixed with the graphene oxide solutions. SNC had a greater impact on the morphology and microstructure of the composite film. Moreover, the introduction of SNC and the efficient reduction process of graphene oxide (GO) render these composite films good mechanical properties as well as high electrical conductivity. The tensile strength of the composite film was improved after being combined with graphene. However, as the addition rate of SNC increased, the strain-to failure of the composite film decreased. Therefore, 10% reduced graphene-starch nanocrystals (10%RGO-SNC) was used as multifunctional sensor materials. And it had strong responses to different external stimuli, such as, temperature, humidity, bending/stretching, and solutions.

The electrode side (CNT@Mo-NC) with ultrahigh porosity of 89% is composed with CNT as skeleton and Mo/N-codoped carbon (Mo-NC) as the crosslinked shell, the unique porous membrane electrode side and interface can strengthen transfer of Li+/electrons/electrolyte for fast reaction kinetics, and provide large space for polysulfide (LiPSs) anchoring and volume expansion. Furthermore, the N active sites with Li+-transfer transition function and Mo clusters with LiPSs adsorption and catalytic ability constitute a highly-efficient synergistic effect in mitigating shuttle effect and reducing energy barrier of redox reaction. For the Mo-13-NC-a surface with adjacent Mo and N, the LiPSs are adsorbed by Mo during the discharge process, and the N sites with lone electron pairs can accelerate diffusion of the positively charged Li+ to Mo, and to react quickly with LiPSs and transform into Li2S. For Mo-13-NC-b surface, however, the repulsion effect between Mo and Li+ during the charge process can promote the rapid migration of the dissociated Li+ to surround graphene due to the N center is occupied by Mo, which is beneficial to the dissociation reaction of Li2S. For the separator side (CNT@NP) with CNT as the skeleton and nonconductive polymer (NP) as crosslinked shell, the porous structure also facilitates the Li+/electrolyte transport. With uniform sulfur loading in the electrode side, an Al/Cu free Li-S battery with refined configuration and long-term cycle stability is formed. The proposed strategy has an important guiding significance for the design of membrane-based electrode/separator/interlayer with low ion/electrolyte transfer resistance in Li-S batteries.

Here, we report an approach to fabricate the Ganoderma Lucidum waste-derived erythrocyte-like N, O self-doped porous biomass carbon (GL800) with a high graphitization degree by a facile carbonization and activation method. The prepared GL800 showed a relatively high specific surface area (2407.5 m(2) g(-1)) and a porous structure like the red blood cell, which affords enough space to accommodate active sites and are easy for electrolytes to infiltrate. Due to the synergistic effect of the rich N, O self-doped elements and porous structures, GL800 shows strong chemical adsorption and physical confinement for poly sulfide. Lithium-sulfur batteries using GL800 electrodes exhibited a high discharge capacity of 1367.8 mA g(-1) at 0.1C and desirable rate performance. Furthermore, the battery has a capacity retention rate after 300 cycles at 0.5C with high coulombic efficiency (99%). Together with the good biocompatibility and biodegradability of the prepared material, it has a high potential for diverse applications in energy storage, environmental remediation, wearable electronics, biomedicine, and other areas, providing a Nature-derived solution with good sustainability.

However, widespread application of Li-S battery is being restricted by the solubility and migration of the reaction intermediates in both discharge and charge processes. In this paper, we report a dualphase electrolyte-based Li-S battery with high capacity and safety performance. With a lithium superionic conductor coating on the deoxidized carbon wrapped carbon nanotube-sulphur (CNT-S) cathode, there is no obvious decay in capacity during the long-term cycles for the assembled dual-phase electrolyte-based Li-S battery, and the discharge capacities achieved after the fortieth cycle are observed to return back to the level of the initial cycle. The sub-micron crystallized NASICON-type glass-ceramic powders with high purity are synthesized by a modified sol-gel method. Compared to the best value reported recently, an order of magnitude enhancement in total conductivity under room temperature is obtained in the doped sample using the process. By introducing this super high lithium-ion conductor to the particular battery architecture and combining it with the developed high-performance positive electrode, the assembled dual-phase electrolyte-based Li-S battery exhibits an efficient utilization of active materials and outstanding high-rate discharge ability, which is promising for possible commercial exploitation and practical applications.

Nonetheless, uncontrollable Li dendrites growth and almost infinite volume change hinder the reliable implementation of lithium anode. Three-Dimensional graphene aerogel is an ideal lithium metal host material because of its abundant porous structure and large surface area, which can relieve the volume change, as well as reduce the effective current density. The lateral dimension of raw material natural graphite will affect the morphology and hierarchical structures of graphene aerogels, thereby affecting the electrochemical properties as a lithium host material. A series of graphene aerogels were prepared from natural graphite with different lateral dimensions (3.4 mu m, 11 mu m, 44 mu m, 178 mu m) for Li host material. The GA-11/Li composite anode exhibits the best electrochemical performance. The symmetrical cell with GA-11/Li electrode shows stable cycling for 600 h at 2 mA cm(-2) for 2 mAh cm(-2). Surprisingly, the Li-S full cell with GA-11/Li anode delivers a high initial specific discharge capacity of 9.38 mAh cm(-2) and stable cycle stability.

However, two bottlenecks (the high defect density and the discontinuous structure) of the widely adopted reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets bring about that the practical photovoltaic properties are far inferior to the theoretical prediction values. Therefore, three-dimensional graphene networks (3DGNs) of high quality have been employed to modify DSSCs to avoid the above mentioned problems. However, a close contact between the graphene basal plane and TiO2 particles in the resulting photoanode is difficult to achieve due to the absence of surface functional groups of the 3DNG. In this study, the RGO nanosheets and 3DGNs co-modified DSSCs are prepared, and the advantages from these two modifiers can give full play to their synergy. The added RGO nanosheets enhance the electron transport ability at the interfaces between graphene, TiO2 and conductive substrate. After optimizing the reduction degree and mass fraction of the RGO nanosheets, the power conversion efficiency of the resulting DSSC reaches 7.68%, which is much higher than those cases of using the 3DGNs (or RGO nanosheets) as modifier alone.

Among the broad range of cathode active materials, elemental sulfur has the highest theoretical specific capacity, thereby making it one of the most promising positive electrode materials these days. In the present work, we show that already a simple cathode design (cathodes with a non-optimized composite microstructure) provides good electrochemical performance both in coin and pouch cells with sulfur loadings of 2 mg cm(-2). Our research data demonstrate that (1) specific capacities of 1000 mA h g(-1) can be achieved over 60 cycles at room temperature while the cyclability at elevated temperatures (here, l > 40 degrees C) is poor, (2) the discharge is the kinetically rate-limiting process, (3) the major fraction of active sulfur in the electrode is lost during the formation cycle at C/50 and (4) the Li-S cells suffer from drying-out due to continuous electrolyte decomposition on the lithium metal anode. In addition, in operando X-ray diffraction shows Li2S formation (grain size of <10 nm) on discharge and the appearance of single phase beta-sulfur in the sub-100 nm size range - rather than the thermodynamically stable orthorhombic polymorph (alpha-sulfur) - by the end of the charge cycle.

However, sulfur possesses very poor electrical conductivity, and lithium polysulfides, resulting from the lithiation of sulfur, are prone to dissolving into electrolytes, which leads to the loss of active materials and poor cyclic performance of the sulfur cathodes. Here we report an MnO2-graphene oxide (GO) double-shelled sulfur (S@MnO2@GO) with improved rate capability and cyclic performance, in which we propose a new reaction using sulfur-reducing KMnO4 to produce MnO2 that covers the surface of the excess sulfur in situ. The resulting MnO2 with honeycomb-like morphology provides excellent voids for storing polysulfides. The outermost GO was assembled to block the open pores of MnO2, thereby minimizing the opportunity for polysulfides to leach into the electrolytes. The GO significantly improved the electrical conductivity of the sulfur cathode, and the S@MnO2@GO exhibited excellent rate capability and long cycle life. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, systems based on Earth-abundant elements deserve much attention. Potassium-ion batteries represent a promising candidate because of the abundance of potassium resources. As for the choices of anodes, graphite exhibits encouraging potassium-ion storage properties; however, it suffers limited rate capability and poor cycling stability. Here, nongraphitic carbons as K-ion anodes with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as the binder are systematically investigated. Compared to hard carbon and soft carbon, a hard-soft composite carbon with 20 wt% soft carbon distributed in the matrix phase of hard carbon microspheres exhibits highly amenable performance: high capacity, high rate capability, and very stable long-term cycling. In contrast, pure hard carbon suffers limited rate capability, while the capacity of pure soft carbon fades more rapidly.

Molecular understanding of polyelectrolyte binders that actively regulate ion transport in sulfur cathodes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; HIGH-ENERGY DENSITY; RAY-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY; LONG CYCLE LIFE; X-RAY; ELEMENTAL-SULFUR; POLYMER ELECTROLYTES; LITHIUM POLYSULFIDE; CAPACITY; PERFORMANCE	Polymer binders in battery electrodes may be either active or passive. This distinction depends on whether the polymer influences charge or mass transport in the electrode. Although it is desirable to understand how to tailor the macromolecular design of a polymer to play a passive or active role, design rules are still lacking, as is a framework to assess the divergence in such behaviors. Here, we reveal the molecular-level underpinnings that distinguish an active polyelectrolyte binder designed for lithium-sulfur batteries from a passive alternative. The binder, a cationic polyelectrolyte, is shown to both facilitate lithium-ion transport through its reconfigurable network of mobile anions and restrict polysulfide diffusion from mesoporous carbon hosts by anion metathesis, which we show is selective for higher oligomers. These attributes allow cells to be operated for > 100 cycles with excellent rate capability using cathodes with areal sulfur loadings up to 8.1 mg cm(-2).

Herein, ultrafine amorphous molybdenum trisulfide (MoS3) nanoparticles uniformly anchored on the surface of two-dimension reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets are employed as alternative sulfur cathode for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries, which show comparable discharge plateau and capacity to sulfur-carbon composite electrodes. Compared with lithium ion batteries using organic liquid electrolyte, sulfide solid electrolyte based all-solid-state lithium metal batteries employing amorphous MoS3 undergo reversible anionic redox driven eletrochemical process instead of conversion reaction after initial discharge process. The Li/75%Li2S-24%P2S5-1% P2O5/Li10GeP2S12/rGO-MoS3 all-solid-state lithium metal batteries deliver high reversible capacity of 553.4 mAh g(-1) at current density of 0.1 A g(-1) after 100 cycles. Even after being cycled at 1.0 A g(-1) for 500 cycles, it still shows the discharge specific capacity of 414.1 mAh g(-1) with excellent cycling stability. The excellent rate capability and cycle performances could be attributed to the improved electronic conductivity and small volume changes as well as the elimination of soluble polysulfide shuttle. In addition, the electrochemical reaction kinetics and capacity contributions were analyzed via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements.

Herein, a new kind of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based COF is in situ fabricated onto the carbon nanotube (CNT) surface (denoted as COF@CNT) to uncover the electrocatalysis behavior by its strong chemical interaction and highly conductive property. We declare that the electrocatalytic activity of DPP-COF can be maximized by introducing an appropriate content of CNT (66 wt %); the analyses including density functional theory calculations, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and Raman show that the DPP moiety can mediate the conversion of polysulfides contributed by a C=O/C-O bonding conversion. Hence, the modified battery shows a 0.042% decay rate over 1000 cycles and achieves a desirable capacity of 8.7 mAh cm(-2) with 10 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading and lean electrolyte (E/S = 5). This work will inspire the rational design of COF@support hybrids for various electrocatalysis applications.

In this process, Ti(OH)(4), the hydrolysis product of TiOSO4 in acidic environment reacts with functional groups (epoxy bridges, hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups) on the GO sheets, which establishes strong Ti-O-C chemical bonds that link in situ formed TiO2 nanoparticles and graphene sheets together. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the existence of the Ti-O-C chemical bond in the resultant composite. Such kind of chemical bond could prevent the aggregation of TiO2 nanoparticles, avoid the restacking of graphene sheets, facilitate the fast transport of the Li-ions, enhance electronic conductivity, offer a high tap density, maintain the structural integrity during charge/discharge process, and consequently achieve excellent cycle stability and high rate capability in Li-ion batteries. At the current density of 5000 mA g(-1), the discharge capacity of the composite can be readily retained at 141.7 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, which is outstanding among the TiO2 composites in the literature.

The electrode is obtained at mild temperatures according to an alternative approach, including metal nanoparticles of either tin or nickel in bulk molten sulfur in the corresponding weight ratio of 85 : 15. We show that this pathway leads to the formation of high-performance electrodes, matching the state-of-the-art results obtained from the best carbonaceous composites. Indeed, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells at a working voltage of about 2.2 V ensure sulfur-mass-referred capacity approaching 1400 mA h g(-1) at a C/3 rate and 740 mA h g(-1) at a rate as high as 3C (1C = 1675 mA h g(-1)), with a coulombic efficiency close to 100% and stable cycling trends over 100 cycles. High-resolution imaging sheds light on the characteristic morphological features of the electrode allowing these remarkable performances, and reveals the beneficial effects of the incorporation of metal nanoparticles within the sulfur phase. The various investigation techniques, with a particular focus on three-dimensional imaging, suggest sulfur electrodeposition upon charging, preferentially adjacent to the electron-conductive centers within the electrode support as well as that on metal clusters. A massive microstructural reorganization is observed during the first cycle in lithium cells with concomitant remarkable enhancements in the electrode charge transfer and variation in the reaction potentials. This process is accompanied by substantial electrode amorphization and migration of the active material toward the current-collector bulk.

Herein, with the aid of W2C nanocrystals, a freestanding 3D current collector is applied as both Li and S hosts owing to its lithiophilic and sulfilic property. On the one hand, the highly conductive W2C can reduce Li nucleation overpotentials, thus guiding uniform Li nucleation and deposition to suppress Li dendrite growth. On the other hand, the polar W2C with catalytic effect can enhance the chemisorption affinity to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and guarantee fast redox kinetics to restrain S species in cathode region and promote the utilization of S. Surprisingly, a full Li-S battery with ultralow cell balance of 1.5:1 and high sulfur loading of 6.06 mg cm(-2) shows obvious redox plateaus of S and maintains high reversible specific capacity of 1020 mAh g(-1) (6.2 mAh cm(-2)) after 200 cycles. This work may shed new sights on the facile design of full Li-S battery with low excessive Li supply.

However, SiOC tends to exhibit poor transport properties and cycling performance as a result of sparsely distributed carbon clusters and inefficient active sites. To overcome these limitations, we designed and fabricated a layered graphene/SiOC heterostructure by solvent-assisted infiltration of a polymeric precursor into a modified three-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogel skeleton. The use of a high-melting-point solvent facilitated the precursor's freeze drying, which following pyrolysis yielded SiOC as a layer supported on the surface of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide aerogels. The fabrication method employed here modifies the composition and microstructure of the SiOC phase. Among the studied materials, the highest levels of performance were obtained for a sample of moderate SiOC content, in which the graphene network constituted 19.8 wt % of the system. In these materials, a stable reversible charge capacity of 751 mAh/g was achieved at low charge rates. At high charge rates of 1480 mA/g, the capacity retention was similar to 95% (352 mAh/g) after 1000 consecutive cycles. At all rates, Coulombic efficiencies >99% were maintained following the first cycle. Performance across all indicators was majorly improved in the graphene aerogel/SiOC nanocomposites, compared with unsupported SiOC. The performance was attributed to mechanisms across multiple length scales. The presence of oxygen-rich SiO(4-x)C(x )tetrahedral units and a continuous free-carbon network within the SiOC provides sites for reversible lithiation, while high ionic and electronic transport is provided by the layered graphene/SiOC heterostructure.

Simultaneously, volumetric energy density is one of the crucial parameters to determine the lifespan of the wearable electronics, in which lightweight and miniaturization is a cardinal prerequisite for realistic application. In this work, an aqueous ZIHC is constructed by harmonizing interlayer spacing of the laminate graphene film and Zn-ion solvation structure to improve the electrode space utilization. Laminate graphene film interspacing has been customized in the range of 0.72-0.81 nm via regulating the ratio of crumple graphene mediator, thereby optimizing the transport kinetics of large size hydrated Zn ions. Zn-ion solvation structure is further tailored by introducing ZnCl2 electrolyte salt to accouple such regulated laminar ionic transport channel. In a result, the thus-derived ZIHC demonstrates an ultralong cycling lifespan of 100 000 cycles (93.9% capacitance retention), a preeminent volumetric capacitance (235.4 F cm(-3)), and a remarkable specific area capacitance contribution (C-ssa approximate to 72 mu F cm(-2)). Quasi-solid-state ZIHC is assembled with ZnCl2 solution-filled polyacrylamide gel electrolyte to concurrently achieve a superior areal capacitance of 1227 mF cm(-2) and great mechanical flexibility toward practical wearable application.

Here, porous polycrystalline NiCo2Px with an olivary morphology and robust structure has been fabricated via a facile derivation method. The NiCo2Px-derived sulfur cathode exhibited superior performance compared with the NiCo2O4 counterpart; besides high rate performance with a capacity of 610 mA h g(-1) at 1C under an areal sulfur loading of 4.35 mg cm(-2), areal capacity up to 8.54 mA h cm(-2) was also achieved with high mass loadings of sulfur (5.79 mg cm(-2)) and a lean electrolyte (6 mu L mg(-1)). The high conductivity and featured porous structure of NiCo2Px is considered to facilitate the electrochemical and kinetic behavior of the sulfur cathode, and its high catalytic activity was also preliminary established based on analyses of CV, EIS and symmetric batteries measurement. This work provides a new strategy for the fabrication of phosphides of elements in the iron family, broadens the application of metal phosphides in Li-S batteries, and deepens the understanding of the correlation between the morphology/phase structure of metal phosphides and the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes.

However, the underlying chemical interaction and reaction kinetics remain poorly understood. Here, focusing on the fundamental understanding of the interfacial chemistry between sulfur cathode materials and lithium polysulfides, we designed and investigated a host material for sulfur, Cu2S@void@C, a tube-in-tube nanostructure with a polar Cu2S inner tube, conductive carbon outer tube and space in between. We found that the Cu2S nanotubes not only have strong adsorptivity to polysulfides through chemical interactions between the CuO surface layer and polysulfides, but also have a catalytic effect to lower the energy barrier of charge transfer at the polysulfides-electrolyte/electrode interface. The Cu2S nanotubes are able to enhance the reaction kinetics of polysulfide lithiation/delithiation and Li2S nucleation/oxidation. A binder free sulfur cathode (G-Cu2S@S@C) with an exquisite 3D conductive network was prepared by encapsulating sulfur into Cu2S@void@C and subsequently wrapping with graphene nanosheets. Remarkably, the G-Cu2S@S@C cathode with a 3.5 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading amount shows a significantly prolonged cycling stability and enhanced rate performance.

Fe2O3 particles were dispersed uniformly on the graphene sheets, and the resulting composites self-assembled into a 3D network via hydrothermal treatment. This strategy provides a facile and environmentally friendly method for the large-scale synthesis of Fe2O3/GAs without any additional reductant. As the anode material for lithium ion batteries, the Fe2O3/GAs in this study manifested an excellent reversible capacity of 995 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at a charge-discharge rate of 100 mA g(-1) and even delivered reversible capacity as high as 372 mA h g(-1) at a high rate of 5000 mA g(-1). The outstanding electrochemical performance of Fe2O3/GAs can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between uniformly dispersed Fe2O3 particles and graphene aerogel, in which a robust 3D framework of graphene provided highly conductive networks with a large surface area and short diffusion path length for the transport of lithium ions.

The results demonstrate that spin-down channel completely dominates the states adjacent Fermi level, which is an intrinsic feature and can be accounted for the valence band maximum derived from the nonbonding N-(p(x),p(y)) orbitals, instead of the bonding C/N-p(z) pi state. Importantly, ferromagnetic ordering is found to be preferred and the magnetism is entirely localized on the N sites of saturated edge due to its stronger electronegativity. Additionally, various edge saturations are further proposed to try to enhance the ferromagnetic ordering and to manipulate the magnetism distributions of Zg-CNNRs. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

As a result, the soluble polysulfide anions become unable to escape from the composite ion-selective films due to the electrostatic repulsion between the immobilized single ion conducting ionomers and the polysulfides with no dead angles. Experimentally, lithiated 4,4'-difluoro bis(benzene sulfonyl)imide and PEG200 were copolymerized to form a polyether based single ion conducting polymer. The ionic conductivity of the blend film made of ionomer and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) at a mass ratio of 1:1 is 0.57 mS cm(-1) at room temperature. The battery capacity with the sealed sulfur electrode is 1412 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, 1041 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C, 873 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C and 614 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C, significantly better than the results with lithiated Nafion especially at high C rates. In addition, a long cycling test at 2 C for 500 cycles gives rise to a stable capacity of 800 mAh g(-1). The intrinsic electrostatic repulsion between polysulfide anions and the negatively charged electrolyte film, together with the overall sealed electrode configuration, is responsible for blocking the shuttling of polysulfides effectively.

Here, we propose a novel strategy for fabricating the HCSs with macro-meso-microporous hierarchical pore structure, without etching and alkali activation. Our results show that HCSs can deliver a high gravimetric energy density of 6.2 Wh.kg(-1) at the power density of 25 W.kg(-1), as well as the energy density reaches up to 3.6 Wh.kg(-1) at a high power density of 2.2 kW.kg(-1). Moreover, assembled into micro-supercapacitor, HCSs perform a high areal capacitance of 15.4 mF.cm(-2) at 0.2 mA.cm(-2). Such excellent electrochemical performances of HCSs should be ascribed to the well-balanced pore distribution, which have been revealed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and equivalent series resistance. It is believed that such advanced hollow carbonaceous materials are not only suitable for supercapacitors, but also be expected to apply for Li-S battery, sensor and drug delivery.

Here, we report our findings in the controlled synthesis of selenium (Se) containing S-rich co-polymers of various compositions as novel cathode materials through a facile inverse vulcanization of S with selenium disulfide (SeS2) and 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene (DIB) as co-monomers. Nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that divinyl functional groups of DIB were chemically cross-linked with S/SeS2 chain radicals through a ring-opening polymerization. The newly formed bonds of C-S, C-Se, and S-Se in novel S-SeS2-DIB copolymers effectively alleviate the shuttle effects of polysulfides/polyselenides. Furthermore, various electrochemical techniques confirm the positive roles of Se-containing co-polymers in enhancing the electrode reaction kinetics and the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphase layer with low charge-transfer resistance, leading to improved high-rate performances. The as-synthesized co-polymer was then infiltrated into well-interconnected, porous nanocarbon networks (Ketjenblack EC600JD, KB600) to provide effective paths for the fast electron transport. Due to the synergistic combination of chemical and physical confinement of the reaction intermediates during cycling, good reversibility for 500 cycles with a low decay rate of 0.0549% per cycle was achieved at 1000 mA g(-1). These encouraging results suggest that the combination of chemical incorporation of SeS, into S-rich co-polymer and the physical confinement of carbon networks is a promising strategy for advancing Li/S batteries and their viability for practical applications.

However, for these sub-nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries, whereas constructing a high-ionic-conductivity solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers are also realized in the channels, showing high Na-ion conductivity toward stabilizing the redox kinetics of the S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon-hosted sulfur cathode delivers superior cycling performance (420 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) after 2000 cycles), high capacity retention of approximate to 90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g(-1), and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)) for room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries.

This work reports a hydrophilic, breathable, biocompatible, and washable graphene-decorated electronic textile that is achieved with the assistance of silk sericin and enables the fabrication of comfortable and integrated multisensing textiles. The graphene-decorated textile is prepared by dyeing commercial textile with an aqueous graphene ink, which contains natural silk sericin-coated graphene and is free of any artificial chemicals. The conformally coated hydrophilic sericin-graphene flakes and the well-reserved knitted structure endow the textile with good conductivity, excellent hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, breathability, and flexibility, ensuring its electronic performance and wearing-comfort. Moreover, the obtained textile is washable after processed with a cross-linking agent. Based on the obtained textile, an integrated multisensing textile that can simultaneously collect and analyze myoelectrical and mechanical signals is developed, enabling the recognition and distinguishment of complex human motions. With the combined features of hydrophilicity, breathability, biocompatibility, washability, and versatility, this strategy of fabricating electronic textiles based on conventional textiles and an aqueous sericin-graphene ink provides a scalable and sustainable way to construct smart wearables.

However, the effects of structure engineering of carbon hosts on the catalytic properties of Pt-based catalysts at the molecular scale are poorly understood. Herein, we report a molecular-level strategy to anchor and stabilize subnanometric Pt clusters on a covalently coupled host of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) for the development of electrocatalysts with high activities toward methanol oxidation reactions. Theoretical evaluation and experimental validation identified that the chemical integration of g-C3N4 on CNT is critical in optimizing the electronic structures and catalytic properties of Pt catalysts. As a result, the Pt-g-C3N4-CNT possesses a high energy level of d-band position, significantly strengthening its adsorption behaviors for the key reaction intermediates during the methanol electrooxidation process and energetically decreasing the energy barriers in the multistep reaction pathways. Combining with the strong catalyst support interactions afforded by the adaptive coordination environment of g-C3N4 with Pt clusters as well as the unimpeded electron transfer via a a-orbital overlap between CNTs and g-C3N4, the as-obtained Pt-gC(3)N(4)-CNT possesses prodigious electrocatalytic properties including high activities, unusual poison tolerance, and reliable longterm discharge stabilities toward methanol oxidation reactions, in comparison to commercial Pt/activated carbon (Pt-AC) and Pt-CNT catalysts. This molecular-level finding opens up a new avenue to design and develop more efficient and effective carbon-based supports for fabricating advanced heterogeneous catalysts and could also be extended to more applications, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, supercapacitors, and sensors.

The morphology and electrode architecture in advanced battery materials have been re-designed into nanofibers and composite nanofibers. Nanofiber-based separators and electrodes have demonstrated to improve the energy density and cycling performance of LIBs. The improvement in the structure and morphology of nanofibers in LIBs such as LiSi and LiSn, have once again ignited the interest in these Li:M alloy anodes as alternative anode and cathode materials. The major challenges that confront this new frontier have the lack of scalable method among the various techniques and designing nanofibers with good structure and morphology that could prevent dendrite penetrations. However, there seems to be a solution in sight with the advent of mass production techniques such as electrospinning and Forcespinning (R) that have recently been developed. In this paper, the use of nanofibers and composite nanofibers as electrode and separator materials for lithium ion, Li-O-2 and Li-S batteries is reviewed. The discussion focuses on the performance characteristics of these nanostructured electrode and separator materials and methods used to improve their performances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Topological flat bands in twisted trilayer graphene	SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						Twisted trilayer graphene; Moire heterostructure; Valley Chern number; Topological flat bands	INSULATOR	Twisted trilayer graphene (TLG) may be the simplest realistic system so far, which has flat bands with nontrivial topology. Here, we give a comprehensive calculation about its band structures and the band topology, i.e., valley Chern number of the nearly flat bands, with the continuum model. With realistic parameters, the magic angle of twisted TLG is about 1.12 degrees, at which two nearly flat bands appears. Unlike the twisted bilayer graphene, a small twist angle can induce a tiny gap at all the Dirac points, which can be enlarged further by a perpendicular electric field. The valley Chern numbers of the two nearly flat bands in the twisted TLG depends on the twist angle theta and the perpendicular electric field E-perpendicular to. Considering its topological flat bands, the twisted TLG should be an ideal experimental platform to study the strongly correlated physics in topologically nontrivial flat band systems. And, due to its reduced symmetry, the correlated states in twisted TLG should be quite different from that in twisted bilayer graphene and twisted double bilayer graphene.

Three protocols were employed: (i) an in situ route, wherein the GNPs (40 wt%) were introduced in the precursor solution of nano-S, (ii) by ex situ mixing of solid GNPs (40 wt%) with solid nano-S, and (iii) by using a combination of methods (i) and (ii). The sulfur particles are uniformly and contiguously attached to the ribbon like graphitic nanoplatelets in the nano-SiGNPs (ex situ 20 wt% + in situ 20 wt%) composite, whereas in the other two composites, the sulfur particles tend to agglomerate over different regions of the platelet fibers. A comparative study of the electrochemical performances of half-cells based on the three composites, nano-S and S revealed that the nano-S/GNPs (ex situ 20 wt% + in situ 20 wt%) composite retains 73% of its' original capacity at the end of 100 cycles with a reversible capacity of 610 mA h g(sulfur)(-1). The cell also showed an outstanding rate capability for the cell capacity reverted to nearly the same value, when the C-rate was ricocheted to 0.1 C after going through higher C-rates. The role of GNPs and the dependence of the method of embedding sulfur particles on GNPs demonstrate that GNPs have tremendous promise to unlock the potential of sulfur for producing cells with reproducible, stable and durable charge storage characteristics.

Here we propose a class of dense intercalation-conversion hybrid cathodes by combining intercalation-type Mo6S8 with conversion-type sulfur to realize a Li-S full cell. The mechanically hard Mo6S8 with fast Li-ion transport ability, high electronic conductivity, active capacity contribution and high affinity for lithium polysulfides is shown to be an ideal backbone to immobilize the sulfur species and unlock their high gravimetric capacity. Cycling stability and rate capability are reported under realistic conditions of low carbon content (similar to 10 wt%), low electrolyte/active material ratio (similar to 1.2 mu l mg(-1)), low cathode porosity (similar to 55 vol%) and high mass loading (>10 mg cm(-2)). A pouch cell assembled based on the hybrid cathode and a 2x excess Li metal anode is able to simultaneously deliver a gravimetric energy density of 366 Wh kg (-1) and a volumetric energy density of 581 Whl(-1).

The application mainly focused on biosensing area, but the anti-tumor study was restricted due to the poor catalytic efficacy of GQDs. Herein, we introduce an enhancing nanozyme using graphene quantum dots/semiconducting polymer nanocomposites (GQD-SPNs) which provide enhanced nanozyme activity for tumor therapy through photothermal effect. Near infrared irradiation guide local temperature increasing at the tumor and boost the hydroxyl radicals (square OH) generation, to synergize with generated O-1(2) and heat for better cancer therapy in Hela tumor bearing-mice. The present GQD-SPNs may turn on great opportunities for the enhanced nanozymes to cancer catalytic therapy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, an ionic sieve-type composite separator (PB/GO@PP) for highly stable Li metal batteries was constructed by coating of sandwich-like Prussian blue/graphene oxide composite films on the commercial PP separator via a facile vacuum infiltration approach. The PB nanospheres with unique open-framework structure and narrow pore window, ensure the PB/GO@PP separator into an ionic sieve to promote homogenous Li ionic flux. Moreover, the PB could act as spacers to prevent GO nanosheets from stacking, leading to porous structure for fast Li-ion transport. With further assistance of GO nanosheets, the PB/ GO@PP separator exhibits improved mechanical strength to alleviate the volume change of Li metal electrodes. Due to the synergistic effects of PB nanospheres and GO nanosheets, the PB/GO@PP separator can effectively regulate uniform Li deposition and suppress Li dendrite growth, resulting in a high Coulombic efficiency (98%) and an ultralong cycling life (500 h) at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2). Importantly, the Lid LiFePO4 full cells with PB/GO@PP separators deliver significantly enhanced rate capacity and cycling stability. These results demonstrate that modification of separators with PB/GO layer can be a compelling strategy to improve the longtime electrochemical stability of Li metal batteries.

Such MOF nanofiber aerogels as carbon precursors can effectively avoid the aggregation of nanofibers during calcination, resulting in the formation of well-dispersed hollow porous carbon nanofibers (HPCNs). Moreover, HPCNs with well-dispersion are investigated as sulfur host materials for Li-S batteries and electrocatalysts for cathode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). On the one hand, HPCNs act as hosts for the encapsulation of sulfur into their hierarchical micro- and mesopores as well as hollow nanostructures. The obtained sulfur cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical features, good cycling stability and high coulombic efficiency. On the other hand, HPCNs exhibit better electrocatalytic activity than aggregated counterparts for ORR. Furthermore, a highly active single atom electrocatalyst can be prepared by the carbonization of bimetallic MOF nanofiber aerogels. The results indicate that well-dispersed HPCNs show enhanced electrochemical properties in contrast to their aggregated counterparts, suggesting that the dispersion situation of nanomaterials significantly influence their final performance. The present concept of employing MOF nanofiber aerogels as precursors will provide a new strategy to the design of MOF-derived nanomaterials with well-dispersion for their applications in energy storage and conversion.

The homogeneous immobilisation of sulphur in the conductive matrix of CuO@GO within a strong chemical bond between carbon and polysulphide intermediates through the Lewis acid function of CuO provides a high specific discharge capacity of the CuO@GO/S electrode in comparison with the GO/S nanocomposite. The CuO@GO/S cathode delivers a discharge capacity of 1048.95 mA h g(-1), 841.74 mA h g(-1), 736.49 mA h g-1, 695.17 mA h g(-1), 643.86 mA h g(-1), and 457.08 mA h g(-1) at different current rates of 0.1 C, 0.4 C, 0.7 C, 0.8 C, 1 C, and 2 C, respectively. The application of CuO@GO/S maintains the average coulombic efficiency of 96 % after 300 cycles at 1 C rate with a capacity retention of approximately 55.8%. The rapid ion transportation within the efficient physicochemical confinement of polysulphides confirmed the role of the CuO@GO/S nanocomposite as a promising cathode material for the next generation of high-energy density Li-S batteries.

It is essential to determine the characteristic parameters and selection principles of substrates and gases in both low- and high-frequency ranges for improving the sound pressure of graphene thermophones. Methods First, the theoretical models for thermoacoustic emission from a graphene on a substrate are established. Analytical expressions of the sound pressure are derived based on analysis of the thermal piston sound source. Then, experimental results of graphene on various transparent substrates are presented to verify the theoretical models. Finally, performance parameters of substrates and gases are summarized and analyzed including the thermal effusivity of substrates, the heat capacity per unit area of substrates, the thermal effusivity of gases and the heat capacity of gases. Results The theoretical predictions agree well with the experimental results. At high frequencies, a lower thermal effusivity of substrates leads to a higher sound pressure. While at low frequencies, the heat capacity per unit area can be selected as the evaluation parameter for substrates. Substrates with a lower heat capacity show better acoustic performances. The performance evaluation parameters of ambient gases can be concluded as the thermal effusivity and the heat capacity for thermoacoustic emission at both high and low frequencies. For gases, the higher thermal effusivity combined with the lower heat capacity is better to achieve a higher sound pressure. Conclusions The theoretical models are applicable to on-substrate thermophones and the results are useful to the optimization of the gas/graphene/substrate multilayer structures.

Herein, we develop novel self-supporting carbon nanofibers with hierarchical porous structures and Fe/N absorption/nucleation centers (Fe/N-HPCNF) as high performance sulfur hosts via a facile co-spinning method. The highly interior porous carbon fiber structure provides good electrolyte infiltration, stable conductive networks and sufficient surfaces for fast Li+/electron transport and sulfur redox while maintaining high sulfur area loading. In addition, the abundant Fe/N heteroatoms evenly dispersed in the fiber strongly restrain polysulfide diffusion through a chemisorption effect and meanwhile regulate homogeneous sulfur nucleation, enhancing the stability of cathodes. Consequently, S@Fe/N-HPCNF cathodes realize a high initial specific capacity of 1273 mA h g(-1) (areal capacity: 4.5 mA h cm(-2)) and long cycle life over 500 cycles with a high sulfur loading of 3.5 mg cm(-2). A stable capacity of 6.6 mA h cm(-2) is achieved even under 9 mg cm(-2) sulfur. What's more, a pouch cell prototype with an ultrahigh sulfur area density (54 mg cm(-2)) was assembled and successfully lighted 10 yellow light-emitting diodes (LED), demonstrating the convenient scale-up of our S@Fe/N-HPCNF cathodes.

In this work, we developed a novel Se composite confined within porous carbon nanospheres (Se/PCNs) as cathode for advanced Li-Se battery. A Se loading as high as 70.5 wt% is attained in such composite. The Se/PCNs cathode shows high volumetric capacity density of 3150 mAh/cm(3) and excellent rate capability (retains 57% of the theoretical capacity at 20 degrees C). Remarkably, it exhibits impressive cycling stability over 1200 cycles with a capacity decay as low as similar to 0.03% per cycle. The superior overall battery performance can be ascribed to high loading of active material, effective protective film formed on the surface of the active material, and strong adsorbing ability of Se/Li2Sex provided by the micropore-rich carbon structure.

The magnetic silica nanoparticles/graphene oxide composites were prepared via conjugating azide-functionalized magnetic silica nanoparticles to acetylene-functionalized graphene oxide by click chemistry with a copper-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. Structure characterization was obtained by means of atomic force microscope, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope. The magnetic silica nanoparticles/graphene oxide composites showed great peroxidase-like activity. The CA 153 immunosensor was fabricated with sandwich method by immobilizing a monoclonal anti-CA 153 antibody on the graphene oxide attached on a screen-printed electrode, peroxidase-like magnetic silica nanoparticles/graphene oxide composites was used as signal label. This method was simple, inexpensive, highly sensitive, and selective for CA 153 detection with a proportional to the logarithm value of the CA 153 concentration from 10(-3) to 200 U/mL and the detection limit of 2.8 x 10(-4) U/mL.

The graphene ribbon is employed to make the graphene-insulator-metal waveguide of finite length as a Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity. When the slit of metallic grating is opened at the position with a maximal magnetic field in F-P resonant cavity, the transmission of light through metallic grating is greatly enhanced since the strongly localized magnetic field is effectively coupled to the slit. The transmission spectrum and the enhancement factor can be adjusted by changing geometrical parameters including the width and the length of slit, the width of graphene ribbon and the period of metallic grating. The transmission peaks exhibit a broad tuning range with a small change in the Fermi energy level of graphene. Moreover, the enhancement factor of transmission peak can be manipulated by the Fermi energy level and the carrier mobility of graphene, and an enhancement factor of 154 is obtained. The findings expand our understanding of hybrid metal-graphene plasmons and have potential applications in building active plasmonic devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The process involves only mixing and pyrolyzing of carbon-silica composites (product of pre-carbonized rice husk) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) powders under inert atmosphere to form porous carbon materials without any SiO2 residue. The fabrication process does not use any toxic or corrosive solution to etch the SiO2, which was more suitable for large scale production. The obtained porous carbon was endowed a desirable specific surface area (1550 m(2)/g) and porous structure with high mesoporosity of 52%. Electrochemical investigation measurements showed that the obtained porous carbon represents a good electrode candidate for supercapacitor, which displayed a high specific capacitance of 220 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. In addition, the electrode displayed excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of about 98% over 10,000 cycles. (C) 2017 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Well sintered ceramic pellets and bars are obtained with 0-9 wt.% MgO. Fracture strength is approximately 135 MPa for composite ceramics with 5-9 wt.% MgO, which is similar to 50% higher than that of pure Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (90 MPa). Lithium-ion conductivity of the composite is above 5 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at room temperature; comparable to the pure Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 material. SEM cross-sections of the composite ceramic shows a much more uniform microstructure comparing with pure ones, owing to the grain growth inhibition effect of the MgO second phase. A battery cell consisting of Li/composite ceramics/Sulfur-Carbon at 25 degrees C exhibits a capacity of 685 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C at the 200th cycle, while maintaining a coulombic efficiency of 100%. These results indicate that the composite ceramic Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12-MgO is promising for the production of electrolyte membrane and fabrication of Li Sulfur batteries.

However, usually both solid-state electrolyte (SSE) and conductive carbon need to be incorporated into the cathode composite to provide Li+/electron pathways, leading to the reduced energy density and inevitable SSE decomposition. Moreover, the real electrochemical behavior of S or Li2S cathodes can not be reflected due to the partially overlapped redox reaction of SSE. Herein, a series of unique P4S10+n cathodes for high-performance ASSLSBs that totally do not need any extra SSE additives are reported. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure coupled with other analyses confirmed that ionic conductive Li3PS4 together with Li4P2S6 components can be electrochemically self-generated during lithiation process and partially maintained to provide fast Li+ transport pathways within the cathode layer. This is further evidenced by a 30-43-fold higher reversible capacity for P4S10+n/C cathodes compared to a S/C cathode. Bulk-type ASSLSBs based on the P4S34/C cathode show a highly reversible capacity of 883 mAh g(-1) and stable cycling performance over 180 cycles with a high active material content of 70 wt%. The present study provides a promising approach for generating ionic conductive components from the electrode itself to facilitate Li+ migration within electrodes in ASSLSBs.

Herein, a novel composite named as (void/nano-Li4Ti5O12 pieces)@C [(v/n-L)@ C] was designed and prepared as a sulfur host. Spinel Li4Ti5O12 here as a multifunctional additive played as polysulfide adsorbent agent and fast Li+ conductor, and carbon shell was designed as electronic conductor, as well as volume barrier to limit the volume expansion caused by sulfur. As-prepared (S/nano-Li4Ti5O12 pieces)@ C [(S/n-L)@ C] are core-shell spheres, which are about 200 nm in size. Nano-Li4Ti5O12 and sulfur were coated by the outer carbon shell with a thickness of about 20 nm. The experimental results show that electrochemical performances of (S/n-L)@ C cathode were enhanced effectively compared to S@C cathode. At 0.5C and 1C, the discharge capacity of (S/n-L)@ C was 33.5% and 40.1% higher than that of S@C at 500th cycle. Even at 2C, its capacity reached 600.9 mAh g(-1) at 1000th cycle. Li+ conductivity of (S/n-L)@ C was one order of magnitude higher than that of S@C, which was reach to 2.55 X 10(8) S cm(-1). The experiment results indicate Li4Ti5O12 plays a promotional role on electrochemical performances of sulfur cathode, especially for stable cycling performance and high rate performance.

The most widely accepted lithium storage mechanism for MHx is the conversion mechanism to form LiH. Our previous study suggested a different lithium storage mechanism of rare earth trihydride (REH3, RE = Y, La and Gd)-graphite composite: the reactive H released from the REH3-REH2 conversion may enhance the lithium storage capacity of graphite by forming a Li-C-H composite. In this work, this interesting phenomenon is further studied by comparing the lithium storage performance of YH3/carbon composite using different carbon materials: graphite, acetylene black, activated carbon and commercial graphene. The enhanced lithium storage capacity by YH3 addition is only observed for graphite, indicating the essential role of the intact layered graphene structure in this new lithium storage mechanism.

Catalase (Cat) immobilized on gelatin-hierarchical porous carbon was realized by the adsorption-crosslinked, here glutaraldehyde (GAD) was used as cross-linking agent. The surface morphologies of modified glass carbon electrodes(GCE) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the electrochemical behaviors of the biosensor were characterized by cyclic voltammogram (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This biosensor exhibited a linear range from 0.2 to 10.7 mM with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.999, a low detection limit of 0.7 mu M and a sensitivity of 74.69 mu AmM-1 cm(-2). Especially, the stability of the as-prepared biosensor was satisfied at room temperature, which means there was almost no change in the performance even after 100 continuous scans, and the storage stability is over 30 days with retention of 98.7% activity only.

Design of new, efficient, and suitable electrode material through interconnection of ZIF-67 by polyaniline nanotube on graphene flakes for supercapacitors	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Metal-organic frameworks; Polyaniline nanotubes; Supercapacitor; Graphene flakes; Composite	METAL-ORGANIC-FRAMEWORKS; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; ENERGY-STORAGE; FACILE SYNTHESIS; NICKEL-FOAM; PERFORMANCE; OXIDE; COMPOSITES; POLYPYRROLE; NANORODS	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been given more significant consideration in energy storage systems due to their high specific surface areas, mesoporous structures, and numerous reaction sites. To introduce additional conductive pathways and facilitate fast charge transfer, MOFs can be integrated with suitable conducting agents. In this study, we report the preparation of a novel Graphene@ZIF-67/polyaniline nanotube (PANI-NT) composite by using an easy stirring and sonication approach at room temperature. ZIF-67 rhombic dodecahedron structures are interconnected through PANI-NTs and deposited on the graphene flakes. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis have confirmed such individual morphology. This composite by the high surface area of 961.53 m2 g-1 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 20416.70 mF g-1 at a current density of 0.05 mA cm-2. This is due to a quick permeation of ions, easy forwarding of electrons, and excellent cooperation between the ingredients of the composite that result in reversible redox interactions. Moreover, the electrode material possesses 75% specific capacitance retention after 3000 cycles indicate good reversibility and cyclic stableness. The prepared Graphene@ZIF-67/PANI-NT composite can render outstanding electrochemical performance and is properly candidate for supercapacitors application.

Different characterization methods, including XRD, Raman spectra, SEM, TEM and XPS, were used to investigated the chemical composition, morphology and structure of the composites. The catalytic activity of the prepared electrodes were estimated by means of cyclic voltammetry(CV), chronoamperometry (CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS). Graphene oxide was firstly reduced by Ni foam directly, and then noble metal(Pd and Au) ions were reduced by reduced graphene oxide supported on the surface of Ni substrate. By varying the palladium/gold mole ratios into 4:1, 5:1 and 6:1, the optimized P(5)A(1)GN anode with a ratio of 5:1 is obtained in terms of the best performance among all these anodes. The P(5)A(1)GN electrode exhibited respectively the maximum peak current density of 0.72 and 1.18A cm(-2)mg(PdAu)(-1) in methanol and ethanol electrooxidation, which only reduced by 1% and 7% after a long-term CV scanning test of 1000 cycles. The better overall performance and stability of the P(5)A(1)GN electrode in methanol and ethanol oxidation was ascribed to the improvement of graphene to the electrode properties, the optimization of Pd electronic properties tuned by Au element as well as the cocatalysis of Au.

Multi-step mechanical stretching, repeated polymer infiltration pyrolysis and graphitization were subsequently performed for the preparation. CNT alignment was accomplished in CNT/C derived from both phenolic and pitch precursors, while aligned carbon matrix could be only found in CNT/pitch derived CNT/C composites. Such phenomenon provided direct evidence for the promoting effect of CNT alignment on the graphitization of the carbon matrix. Mechanisms for the stretching induced alignment and the formation of aligned carbon matrix were proposed and discussed. The planar configuration of pitch molecules and its Pi-Pi stacking with CNT walls were considered beneficial for the stress induced graphitization, thus the carbon matrix could be aligned along the CNT walls. Based on the tensile and electrical conductivity measurements, we believed that CNT alignment dominated both mechanical and conducting performances of cured (stabilized) and carbonized CNT/C composites; while the alignment of carbon matrix played the decisive role in graphitized CNT/C. In addition, the carbonized composites could exhibit tensile strength as high as 1.2 GPa, while the electrical conductivity of graphitized samples was in the scale of 10(5) S/m.

However, further study on atomistic-scale mechanism of the interaction between Li and Graphene-Silicon (Gra/Si) system is very challenging for current experimental technologies. In this work, the mechanism of Li adsorption on a Gra/Si system is investigated using density functional theory. Based on the calculated results of binding energies, charge transfer, charge density difference, mean squared displacement and diffusion constant, it concluded that the incorporation of graphene can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of silicon as high performance anode material, which consists with the experimental results. A theoretical capacity of 2896 mAhg(-1) is obtained, it is closed to the first cycle capacity of 2634 mAhg(-1) in experiment. Moreover, the origin of irreversible capacity of Gra/Si system is investigated. The shorter bond lengths Li-S and Li-C are related to strong Li-C and Li-Si connections and irreversible capacity loss during lithiation. Then a reversible capacity of 2383 mAhg(-1) is obtained by excluding the Li atoms with shorter bond lengths, and is comparable to the reversible capacity of 2497 mAhg(-1) in experiment. The proposed computational frame can be used to evaluate and design nanocomposite anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.

Here, we report Sb2S5, nanoparticles (similar to 5 nm) uniformly encapsulated in three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene foam, which were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal coassembly strategy, as a high-performance anode material for sodium-ion batteries. The as-prepared composite can be directly used as electrodes without adding a binder or current collector, exhibiting outstanding electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity (845 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), ultralong cycling life (91.6% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1)), and exceptional rate capability (525 mA h g(-1) at 10.0 A g(-1)). This is attributed to fast Na+ ion diffusion from the ultrasmall nanoparticles and excellent electric transport between the active material and 3D porous graphene, which also provide an effective strategy for anchoring the nanoparticles. Experimental results show that the Sb2S5 undergoes a reversible reaction of Sb2S5 + 16Na <-> 5Na(2)S + 2Na(3)Sb during sodiation/desodiation. Moreover, a full cell with Na-3(VO0.5)(2)(PO4)(2)F-2/C cathode and the as-prepared composite anode was assembled, displaying high output voltage (similar to 2.2 V) with a stable capacity of 828 mA h g(-1) for anode material (with 100 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1)), showing the potential for practical application.

Without polymetric binders, conductive additives, or metallic current collectors, the freestanding cathode demonstrates an initial capacity of 632.7 mA h g(-1), value close to 95% of the theoretical capacity of 675 mA h g(-1). At 1, 4, and 10 C, the cathode owns reversible specific capacities of 558.3, 436.4, and 192.9 mA h g(-1), respectively. Such record-breaking values, as compared to earlier Li-Se batteries, are attributed to the unique 3D mesoporous, conductive network offering highly efficient channels for electron transfer and ionic diffusion, as well as the hierarchical structure preventing fast dissolution of polyselenides and suppressing volume expansion of Se in charge/discharge. The work is expected to open up promising opportunities to realize the application of Li-Se batteries in portable electronics, electrical vehicles, and so forth.

In this work, amphiphilic graphene oxide nanosheets were employed as "surfactant" to disperse CNTs to create stable graphene oxide-dispersed CNT (GCNT) supports in water for covalently loading cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles with improved distribution and binding efficiency. Compared with original Fe3O4 nanos and CNT-loaded Fe3O4 nanocomplex, the prepared GCNT-Fe3O4 nanocomposite could achieve higher aqueous stability and, especially, much stronger peroxidase-like catalysis and electrocatalysis to H2O2, presumably resulting from the synergetic effects of two conductive carbon supports and cubic Fe3O4 nanocatalysts effectively loaded. Colorimetric and direct electrochemical detections of H2O2 and glucose using the GCNT-Fe3O4 nanocomposite were conducted with high detection sensitivities, demonstrating the feasibility of practical sensing applications. Such a magnetically recyclable "enzyme mimic" may circumvent some disadvantages of natural protein enzymes and common inorganic catalysts, featuring the multi-functions of high peroxidase-like catalysis, strong electrocatalysis, magnetic separation/recyclability, environmental stability, and direct H2O2 electrochemistry.

The poor electrical conductivity of sulfur and the high diffusivity of the intermediate lithium polysulfides create various problems, which limit the utilization of the full potential of these batteries. Polar conducive sulfur hosts such as titanium nitride (TiN) make it possible to realize remarkable improvements in active material utilization and capacity retention outcomes over long-term cycling. It has not been possible to use these polar, conducive, ceramic materials for higher active material loading ( > 2 mg cm(-2)) due to their low flexibility compared to carbonaceous materials. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of designing a three-dimensional free-standing electrode using polycrystalline 1-D TiN for a relatively high sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2). The electrochemical performance of this 1-D TiN-based electrode is compared to that of an electrode based on 1-D TiO2 (the starting material for TiN synthesis). The results demonstrate the catalytic effect of TiN by virtue of its endowed conductivity, leading to remarkable capacity retention and better active material utilization at high C-rates compared to a TiO2-based electrode.

The effects of reduced graphene oxide content on the mechanical and electrical properties of the fiber were investigated. Thermal gravimetric analyzer, differential scanning calorimeter, x-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed that the graphene oxide was reduced to reduced graphene oxide in the sintering process and the performances of the composite fiber were improved. The tensile strength of reduced graphene oxide/glass composite fiber was 20% higher than the pristine glass fibers by the addition of 0.5 wt% of reduced graphene oxide. Reduced graphene oxide content was positively correlated with composites conductivity, and according to the percolation theory, the percolation threshold of reduced graphene oxide/glass composite fiber was about 0.5 wt%, and the conductivity of the composite fibers was increased by four orders of magnitude compared to the pristine glass fibers when the content of reduced graphene oxide was 0.5 wt%.

Despite the significant progress in cathode development, lithium metal degradation and the polysulfide shuttle remain two critical challenges in the practical application of Li-S batteries. Development of advanced electrolytes has become a promising strategy to simultaneously suppress lithium dendrite formation and prevent polysulfide dissolution. Here, a new class of concentrated siloxane-based electrolytes, demonstrating significantly improved performance over the widely investigated ether-based electrolytes are reported in terms of stabilizing the sulfur cathode and Li metal anode as well as minimizing flammability. Through a combination of experimental and computational investigation, it is found that siloxane solvents can effectively regulate a hidden solvation-ion-exchange process in the concentrated electrolytes that results from the interactions between cations/anions (e.g., Li+, TFSI-, and S2-) and solvents. As a result, it could invoke a quasi-solid-solid lithiation and enable reversible Li plating/stripping and robust solid-electrolyte interphase chemistries. The solvation-ion-exchange process in the concentrated electrolytes is a key factor in understanding and designing electrolytes for other high-energy lithium metal batteries.

The cathodes are composed of LiFePO4 (high power) and sulfur (high gravimetric capacity), allowing high discharging rates as well as high gravimetric capacities, which are especially attractive for numerous existing applications. In this study, different strategies have been tested to reduce polysulfide shuttling in batteries with these cathodes, greatly improving their performance. Batteries which were assembled with electrolyte mixtures of tetramethylsulfone and 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TMS/TTE) show significantly better performance than with the typical electrolyte composition used for Li-S batteries. Moreover, various carbons with different pore size distributions in the C/S composite were mixed with LiFePO4 in an electrode reaching high discharge capacities (72 % of the theorical composite capacity) and stable Coulombic efficiency of 99 %. As a result, an improved active material utilization is observed, confirming its possible application as a commercial battery cathode.

Herein, we report an enhanced hollow framework to improve the applicability of the sulfur confinement. A clustered-microcapsule-shaped microporous carbon coated sulfur (CM-S@MPC) composite is prepared from the clustered zinc sulfide precursor, through an in situ oxidation process. The high specific surface area and the in situ preparation guarantee the uniform distribution of sulfur inside the carbon microcapsule, even under a higher sulfur content of 83 wt %. In addition, the interconnected frame constructed by the stacking of carbon microcapsules also mitigates the lithium polysulfide loss by setting interlayered hurdles on their pathway along the outward diffusion. Hence, these enable a full demonstration of excellent cycling stability, compared to the control sample obtained via physical sulfur infiltration. The outstanding decay rate of 0.039% per cycle is achieved during 700 cycles at 1 C, even under high sulfur loading.

To overcome these constraints, we herein propose the rational design of robust NiO nanoframeworks to make high S filling and binder-free cathodes. Notably, such arrayed thick frameworks have an impressive spatial filling ability, showing a remarkable S filling ratio of 77.6%. To further optimize the cell behaviors, all of the arrayed NiO matrix surface is evenly paved by graphitic carbon shells, and the open-up architecture for S-filled frameworks is intactly encapsulated by functionalized nickel nitrate hydroxide layers. Thanks to subtle interfacial engineering and smart hybrid configurations, a high initial discharge capacity of over 1481 mAh g(-1) and a longer-term cyclic lifespan are achieved at 0.1 C. Also, this optimized binder-free cathode leads to great improvements in Coulumbic efficiency, the S utilization ratio, and rate capabilities. Our work presents not only an appealing route to making high S filling and binder-free cathodes for Li-S cells but also insight for the smart design of integrated film electrodes for other electrochemical applications.

The as-obtained unstacked double-layer templated graphene (DTG) is expected to fully demonstrate intrinsic properties of graphene assemblies if its detailed structure and component can be well controlled. Herein, both the lateral size and graphene protuberance size and areal density of DTG were well modulated through adjusting the template morphology and casting procedures. The lateral size of the as-obtained DTG was ranging from 0.4 to 2 mu m. They exhibited a very high specific surface area ranging from 1336 to 1579 m(2) g(-1) and tailorable graphene protuberances with areal density from 5.3 x 10(14) to 7.8 x 10(14) m(-2). DTG flakes with more hydrophilic surface and well tunable reactivity were obtained by introducing nitrogen into DTG through in-situ deposition. The as-synthesized N-doped DTG afforded significantly improved reactivity on oxygen reduction reaction (nearly 50 mV positively shifted onset potential compared with that of pristine DTG and a current preservation of 92.8% after 16,000 s test).

Herein, we demonstrate facile synthesis of Li2S-graphene oxide composites for use as high-capacity and stable-cycling Li2S cathodes. The wrapping of graphene oxide onto the surface of Li2S through favorable lithium-oxygen interactions helps to minimize the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides into the electrolyte during cycling, which is a major reason for rapid capacity decay. Using the Li2S-graphene oxide composites as a cathode material, we demonstrate a high discharge capacity of 782 mA h g(-1) of Li2S (similar to 1122 mA h g(-1) of S) with stable cycling performance over 150 charge-discharge cycles.

The effect of the graphene oxide material on the low-temperature crack resistance of the asphalt and mixes was investigated by bending beam rheometer (BBR) tests, beamlet bending tests at different low temperatures, and characterization by scanning electron microscopy for its microscopic condition. OpenCV image processing was used to visually represent the low-temperature cracking of the mix. The results of the BBR tests showed that the incorporation of graphene oxide resulted in a reduction in creep stiffness S and an increase in creep rate m compared with the control asphalt. The best improvement in the low-temperature cracking resistance of the polyurethane/SBS-modified asphalt was achieved at 0.5% GO doping. The results of the small beam flexural tests showed that graphene oxide as a modifier improved the flexural strength and flexural strain of the mix, resulting in a mix with a lower stiffness modulus and a better relaxation stress capacity with the addition of graphene oxide, which is also expressed through the OpenCV images. Graphene oxide significantly improved the low-temperature crack resistance of polyurethane-SBS-modified asphalt and its mixes. As a new type of nanomaterial-modified asphalt, graphene oxide/polyurethane/SBS composite-modified asphalt shows promising applicability in cold zone roads.

A free-standing FLG monolithic network foam was formed as a negative of a Ni metallic foam template by CVD followed by etching away of Ni. The FLG foam offers excellent electrical conductivity, an appropriate hierarchical pore structure for containing the electro-active sulphur and facilitates rapid electron/ion transport. This cathode system does not require any additional binding agents, conductive additives or a separate metallic current collector thus decreasing the weight of the cathode by typically similar to 20-30 wt%. A Li-S battery with the sulphur-FLG foam cathode shows good electrochemical stability and high rate discharge capacity retention for up to 400 discharge/charge cycles at a high current density of 3200 mA g(-1). Even after 400 cycles the capacity decay is only similar to 0.064% per cycle relative to the early (e.g. the 5th cycle) discharge capacity, while yielding an average columbic efficiency of similar to 96.2%. Our results indicate the potential suitability of graphene foam for efficient, ultra-light and high-performance batteries.	[Xi, Kai; Gao, Chenlong; Peng, Xiaoyu; Ducati, Caterina; Kumar, R.

The resulting GOCNT-Pt nanocomposites could present improved aqueous dispersion stability and Pt spatial distribution. Unexpectedly, they could show greatly enhanced peroxidase-like catalysis and electrocatalysis activities in water, as evidenced in the colorimetric and electrochemical investigations in comparison to some inorganic nanocatalysts commonly used. Moreover, it is found that the new enzyme mimetics could exhibit peroxidase-like catalysis activity comparable to natural enzymes; yet, they might circumvent some of their inherent problems in terms of catalysis efficiency, electron transfer, environmental stability, and cost effectiveness. Also, sandwiched electrochemical immunoassays have been successfully conducted using GOCNT-Pt as enzymatic tags. Such a fabrication avenue of noble metal nanocatalysts loaded on well-dispersed conductive carbon supports should be tailored for the design of different enzyme mimics promising the extensive catalysis applications in environmental, medical, industrial, and particularly aqueous biosensing fields.

The DBD plasma process is a dry and sustainable (solvent-free, limited energy consumption technique compatible with upscaling. Different conductive coated sulfur materials were produced and labeled as "PEDOT-S" [poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene-sulfur)], "PANI-S" (polyaniline-sulfur), "PTs-S" (polythiophene-sulfur), and "PPy-S" (polypyrrole-sulfur). The corresponding electrical conductivities were measured at 10(-5), 10(-6), 10(-7), and 10(-8) S/cm, respectively. The role of the conductive coating is to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-S cells by improving the electronic conductivity of the sulfur particles and preventing the well-known polysulfide shuttle phenomenon. A vast range of characterization methods including conductivity analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and carbon-13 NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were used to assess the chemical characteristics using the different conductive polymer-coated sulfur materials. In the coated sulfur samples, fragmentation of aromatic rings was observed, 88% for the PTs-S and 42% for the PEDOT-S, while it is very limited for the PANI-S. Such a phenomenon has never been reported in the literature. The uncoated and coated sulfur powders were used (as active material) in positive electrodes of Li-S cells with a relatively high sulfur loading of similar to 4.5 mg/cm(2) using LiPAA (lithium polyacrylate) as an (aqueous) binder. Long-term galvanostatic cycling at C/10 and multi-C-rate tests showed the capacity fade and rate capability losses to be highly mitigated for cells containing conductive polymer-coated sulfur in comparison to cells using the uncoated sulfur. Kinetic investigations by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses undoubtedly confirm improved electron and Li-ion transport within the electrodes containing conductive polymer-coated sulfur. The electrochemical performance can be ranked as PEDOT-S > PANI-S > PTs-S > PPy-S > raw sulfur.

The MoCuSe-rGO modified glassy carbon electrode (MoCuSe-rGO/GCE) was fabricated for the first time, which provided a large surface area and exhibited a rapid electron transport rate for the bisphenol A (BPA). The electrochemical behavior of BPA was investigated with various techniques and a new electroanalytical method was established with differential pulse voltammetry. Under optimum conditions, the proposed sensor showed an excellent electrochemical response to BPA with detection limit of 9.0 x 10(-10) mol L-1 and wider linear range of 3.0 x 10(-9) mol x 10(-4) mol L-1. Finally, the proposed method was applied to determine BPA in real samples with satisfactory results. This work might provide a new thought for the development of electrochemical sensors with hybrid materials.

An emerging strategy for circumventing these issues is to design novel porous CT-based nanostructures. Herein, a spheres-in-tube nanostructure with hierarchical porosity is successfully engineered, by encapsulating heteroatom-doping hollow carbon spheres into one carbonaceous nanotube (HCSs@CT). This intriguing nanoarchitecture integrates the merits of large specific surface area, good porosity, and high content of heteroatoms, which synergistically facilitates the transportation and exchange of ions and electrons. Accordingly, the as-prepared HCSs@CTs possess outstanding performances as electrode materials of supercapacitors, including superior capacitance to that of CTs, HCSs, and their mixtures, coupled with excellent cycling life, demonstrating great potential for applications in energy storage.

Reaction kinetics was monitored by XRD and the copolymer structure was confirmed by H-1 NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. DSC and TGA indicate the significant increase in Tg and thermal stability of the copolymer with increase in ring size and number of double bonds density; respectively. Thermal conductivity of the copolymers (0.083 W/mK at 50 degrees C) was also considerably reduced compared to the pristine sulfur, which make these copolymer suitable for thermal insulation applications. Moreover, these sulfur-rich copolymers can also be used as potential cathode materials in lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, Li+ extraction from Li2S usually suffers from a huge voltage barrier due to its poor electron conductivity and sluggish Li+ ion diffusion during activation. In this work, trace sulfone-assisted-NH4I is adopted as an electrolyte additive with synergistic dissolution and catalysis effects to alleviate the voltage barrier of Li2S. On one hand, the intercalation between sulfoneNH(4+) and Li2S turns solid Li2S into liquid phase, which significantly speeding up the transport of electrons and Li+ ions during activation. On the other hand, I- works as a redox mediator, which further facilitates the oxidation of Li2S to polysulfides. By taking the advantages of synergistic dissolution and catalysis effects from sulfone-NH4+ and I-, the Li2S cathode can be activated at similar to 3.0 V with a very flat plateau. Finally, the Li2S cathode cycled in the electrolyte with optimized 0.5% sulfone-assisted-NH4I additive shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1160 mAh g(-1) at 0.05C, along with enhanced cycling performances and rate capabilities.

Here we report room-temperature K-S batteries utilizing a microporous carbon-confined small-molecule sulfur composite cathode. The synergetic effects of the strong confinement of microporous carbon matrix and the small-molecule sulfur structure can effectually eliminate the formation of soluble polysulfides and ensure a reversible capacity of 1198.3 mA h g(-1) and retain 72.5% after 150 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of similar to 97%. The potassium-storage mechanism was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and theoretical calculations. The results suggest that K2S is the final potassiation product along with the reaction of 2K + S <-> K2S, giving a theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g(-1). Our findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance room-temperature K-S batteries but also offer a basic comprehension of the potassium storage mechanism of sulfur cathode materials.

Although graphene-assisted epoxy resin (ER) display promising potential to enhance the thermal performances, some limitations of the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets and three-dimensional graphene networks (3DGNs) hinder the further improvement of the resulting thermal interface materials (TIMs). In this study, both the RGO nanosheets and 3DGNs are adopted as co-modifiers to improve the thermal conductivity of the ER. The 3DGNs provide a fast transport network for phonon, while the presence of RGO nanosheets enhances the heat transport at the interface between the graphene basal plane and the ER. The synergy of these two modifiers is achieved by selecting a proper proportion and an optimized reduction degree of the RGO nanosheets. Moreover, both the high stability of the thermal conductivity and well mechanical properties of the resulting TIM indicate the potential application prospect in the practical field.

However, the polysulfide shuttle effect is the primary challenge for future applications of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel barrier layer material, nonstoichiometric W18O49 nanowires, is reported to alleviate the undesirable shuttle effect, thereby largely boosting the specific capacity and cyclability of Li-S batteries. Without particular cathode design, the introduction of W18O49 nanowires enables the commercially available micro-sized sulfur cathode with 70% sulfur loading to deliver a respectable initial discharge capacity of 1142 mA h g(-1) and retain a specific capacity of about 809 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles, even at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1). To the best of our knowledge, such a capacity fading for Li-S batteries based on high loading of commercial micro-sized sulfur has been rarely reported.

PmDB was first electrodeposited onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode by electrochemical polymerization of m-dihydroxybenzene in the presence of graphene oxide (GO). Next, the obtained GO/ PmDB composites were electrochemically reduced to RGO/PmDB at a negative potential. The RGO/ PmDB composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The RGO/PmDB composites exhibited high electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and therefore, they were used for sensitive glucose determination by immobilizing GOD within the composite films. The as-prepared glucose biosensor exhibited a linear response ranging from 0.5 to 15 mM, a low detection limit of 0.023 mM (S/N = 3). Also, the RGO-/PmDB-based glucose sensor displayed excellent selectivity as well as good reproducibility and stability.

MnCo2O4 Spiny Microspheres as Polysulfide Anchors and Conversion Catalysts for High-Performance Li-S Batteries	ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							CARBON SPHERES; SULFUR HOST; LITHIUM; ARRAYS; CAPACITY; DENSITY; CELL	Li-S is considered an attractive energy storage technology in terms of the high energy density and abundant availability of sulfur. However, factors such as the poor conductivity of sulfur, the polysulfide shuttle, poor cycle life, and sluggish reaction kinetics are the major challenges that must be solved for commercialization. Here, MnCo2O4 (MCO) spiny microspheres prepared by the hydrothermal method are used both as polysulfide anchors and conversion catalysts for high-performance Li-S batteries. The S@MCO/CNT cathode shows an initial capacity of 1122 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and after 100 cycles displays 1018 mA h g(-1) amounting to a capacity retention of 91%. Also, the S@MCO/CNT cathode exhibits high rate performance, delivering a discharge capacity of 754 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and 500 mA h g(-1) at 4 C rate. Furthermore, the catalytic property of MCO is investigated through Li2S6 absorption studies. The results lend support to the observation regarding improved polysulfide binding ability, mitigation of polysulfide shuttling, and enhancement in the polysulfide conversion rate when a small amount of MCO is used with the sulfur cathode.

Herein, a novel three-dimensional self-supported TiO2@C membrane with hierarchical interlinked porosity and oxygen vacancies was prepared via a phase-inversion method to act as a sulfur host. The procured TiO2-x@C membrane facilitates the infiltration of electrolyte, provides fast lithium-ion and electron transport channels and abundant sulfur loading sites, and shows superb structural buffering against the large volume changes during the conversion process between sulfur and lithium sulfide. More importantly, the introduction of oxygen vacancies not only enhances the conductivity of the original TiO2, but it also improves the corresponding adsorption abilities toward polysulfides and the subsequent transformation dynamics. Therefore, the TiO2-x@C membrane can significantly inhibit the polysulfide shuttle effect through polar chemisorption and conversion catalysis. Based on the above superiorities, the TiO2-x@C/S membrane electrode exhibits an impressive lifespan of more than 500 cycles at 2 C with a prominent ultimate specific discharge capacity of 715.2 mA h g(-1).

Preparing titanium dioxide/biomass carbon composite electrodes can effectively solve problems of shuttle effects. However, relationships between titanium dioxide position and polysulfide capture and conversion abilities are not clear. In this paper, a sol-gel method is used to obtain titanium dioxide/biomass carbon composite electrode. Four composite structures with different titanium dioxide loading positions are obtained by controlling the amount of added surfactant. When the mass ratio of biomass carbon to surfactant is 1:1, titanium dioxide is mainly loaded on the surface of biomass carbon with strong crystallinity. The composite material has strong polysulfide capture and conversion capabilities, which lead to stable capacity storage. The C:HA(1:1)/S electrode remains at 254.5 mAh-g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C. Good cycling stability depends on titanium dioxide with strong crystallinity on the surface of biomass carbon.

In this work, the correlation of the applied electric field F and the adsorption/desorption behavior of a CO molecule on Al-doped graphene was studied by density functional theory calculations. The results indicate that a negative F strengthens the adsorption of the CO on the Al-doped graphene, while the adsorption is reduced when a positive F is present. Furthermore, desorption of the CO molecule from the graphene layer commences when F >= 0.03 a.u. is applied, which can be used to reactivate the sensor material for repetitious application.

However, the low conductivity of FeF(3)0.33H(2)O greatly restricts its application. Generally, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene can be used as conductive networks to improve the conductivities of active materials. In this work, the FeF(3)0.33H(2)O cathode material was synthesized via a liquid-phase method, and the FeF(3)0.33H(2)O/CNT + graphene nanocomposite was successfully fabricated by introduction of CNTs and graphene conductive networks. The electrochemical results illustrate that FeF(3)0.33H(2)O/CNT + graphene nanocomposite delivers a high discharge capacity of 234.2mAhg(-1) in the voltage range of 1.8-4.5V (vs. Li+/Li) at 0.1 C rate, exhibits a prominent cycling performance (193.1mAhg(-1) after 50cycles at 0.2 C rate), and rate capability (140.4mAhg(-1) at 5 C rate). Therefore, the electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance of the FeF(3)0.33H(2)O cathode material modified with CNTs and graphene composite conductive network can be effectively improved.

J	Khavasi, A				Khavasi, Amin			Fast convergent Fourier modal method for the analysis of periodic arrays of graphene ribbons	OPTICS LETTERS			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC-WAVE SCATTERING; ADAPTIVE SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; PERFECT ABSORBER; DIFFRACTION; FORMULATION; EXPANSION; EFFICIENT; GRATINGS; LIGHT	Li's Fourier factorization rules [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 13, 1870 (1996)] should be applied to achieve a fast convergence rate in the analysis of diffraction gratings with the Fourier modal method. I show, however, that Li's inverse rule cannot be applied for periodic patterns of graphene when the conventional boundary condition is used. I derive an approximate boundary condition in which a nonzero but sufficiently small height is assumed for the boundary. The proposed boundary condition enables us to apply the inverse rule, leading to a significantly improved convergence rate. A periodic array of graphene ribbons is in fact a special type of finite-conductivity strip grating, and thus the proposed approach is also applicable to these kinds of structures.

In this study, a high electrochemical activity and water oxygen-stable di-lithium squamate (Li2C4O4) were developed as lithium compensation agent and lithium source . The catalytic effect of carbon defects on Li2C4O4 decomposition was found through ex situ measurement and density functional theory calculation (DFT). Based on this result, the decomposition efficiency of this agent was increased to 2.5 times through the selection of the conductor. Because of the nearly 100% decomposition efficiency, this lithium compensation agent can be also used as a lithium source for the lithium-free battery system. In this study, this agent was used in a lithium-metal-free Si-C//S/pPAN battery system, without the constraints of the lithium-metal anode, the assembly environmental demand for this battery can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, we found that the CO2 produced in the decomposition process can modify the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) membrane, which can significantly improve the cycle performance. We obtained a long cycle metal-free Si-C//S/pPAN battery with a specific capacity of 1200 mAh g(-1) at a 1C current density. We also assembled the soft-pack battery, and obtained a Si-C//S/pPAN soft-pack battery with an energy density of 340.3 Wh kg(-1), and more than 96.9% of the capacity remained after 300 cycles.

Graphene is widely employed as a heteroepitaxial substrate for the growth of TMD layers and as an ohmic contact, where the graphene/TMD heterostructure is naturally formed. The presence of graphene can unpredictably influence the CDW order in 2D CDW conductors. This work reports the CDW transitions of 2H-NbSe(2)layers in graphene/NbSe(2)heterostructures. The evolution of Raman spectra demonstrates that the CDW phase transition temperatures (T-CDW) of NbSe(2)are dramatically decreased when capped by graphene. The induced anomalous short-range CDW state is confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. The findings propose a new criterion to determine theT(CDW)through monitoring the line shape of the A(1g)mode. Meanwhile, the 2D band is also discovered as an indicator to observe the CDW transitions. First-principles calculations imply that interfacial electron doping suppresses the CDW states by impeding the lattice distortion of 2H-NbSe2. The extraordinary random CDW lattice suggests deep insight into the formation mechanism of many collective electronic states and possesses great potential in modulating multifunctional devices.

Boron, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur doping greatly affect the electrochemical properties of Li2S/graphene. Here, we investigate the interfacial binding energy, lithium adsorption energy, interface diffusion barrier, and electronic structure by first-principles calculations to unveil the diverse effects of different dopants during interfacial lithiation reactions. The interfacial lithium storage follows the pseudocapacitylike mechanism with intercalation character. Two different mechanisms are revealed to enhance the interfacial lithium adsorption and diffusion, which are the electron-deficiency host doping and the vacancylike structure evolutions with bond breaking. The synergistic effect between different dopants with diverse doping effects is also proposed. The results give a theoretical basis for the materials design with doped graphene as advanced materials modification for energy storage.

In this multifunctional host materials, graphene can significantly improve the electronic conductivity and the hollow sphere structure of HGSn proved by TEM can buffer the volume change of the discharge and charge products. Moreover, HGSn could provide physical adsorption and chemical affinity by forming C=S bond and S-Sn-O bond to greatly alleviate the polysulfide shuttle effect, which were represented by UV-Vis and FT-IR spectra, respectively. As a result, the as-prepared HGSn/S electrodes exhibit good electrochemical performance with high sulfur loading of 2.25 mg cm(-2). The discharge specific capacity is 706.82 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles and 604.93 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles at 0.2C, and the capacity retention is 80.90% and 69.37% with average capacity attenuation of 0.096% and 0.088% for each cycle.

The simulation results show that an adsorbed layer with double peaks is exclusively found for [C-3(mim)(2)](BF4)(2), while a single peak of the other three cations is observed at the neutral electrode, due to the difference in ion-wall interaction and cation-anion association. As the electrode becomes negatively charged, the second peak of [C-3(mim)(2)](2+) is dramatically reduced, whereas those of [C-6(mim)(2)](2+) and [C-9(mim)(2)](2+) become non-trivial. The capacitance-potential curve of EDLs in DILs manifests a transition from camel shape to bell shape as the cation chain length increases, which is attributed to the enlargement of ion adsorption (per unit charge) on the electrode and the decrease of attractive interaction between ions.

However, the development of batteries based on graphite anodes is hindered by their limited energy density. With its ultrahigh theoretical capacity (3860 mAh.g(-1)), low redox potential (-3.04 V), and satisfactorily low density (0.54 g.cm(-3)), Li metal is the most promising anode for next-generation high-energy-density batteries. Unfortunately, the limited cycling life and safety issues raised by dendrite growth, unstable solid electrolyte interphase, and "dead Li" have inhibited their practical use. An effective strategy is to develop a suitable lithiophilic matrix for regulating initial Li nucleation behavior and controlling subsequent Li growth. Herein, sing-leatom cobalt coordinated to oxygen sites on graphene (Co-O-G SA) is demonstrated as a Li plating substrate to efficiently regulate Li metal nucleation and growth. Owing to its dense and more uniform lithiophilic sites than single-atom cobalt coordinated to nitrogen sites on graphene (Co-N-G SA), high electronic conductivity, and high specific surface area (519 m(2.)g(-1)), Co-O-G SA could significantly reduce the local current density and promote the reversibility of Li plating and stripping. As a result, the Co-O-G SA based Li anodes exhibited a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% at a current density of 1 mA.cm(-2) with a capacity of 1 mAh.cm(-2), and excellent rate capability (high current density of 8 mA.cm(-2)). Even at a high plating capacity of 6 mAh.cm(-2), the Co-O-G SA electrode could stably cycle for an ultralong lifespan of 1300 h. In the symmetric battery, the Co-O-G SA based Li anode (Co-O-G SA/Li) possessed a stable voltage profile of 18 mV for 780 h at 1 mA.cm(-2), and even at a high current density of 3 mA.cm(-2), its overpotential maintained a small hysteresis of approximately 24 mV for > 550 h. Density functional theory calculations showed that the surface of Co-O-G SA had a stronger interaction with Li atoms with a larger binding energy, -3.1 eV, than that of Co-N-G SA (-2.5 eV), leading to a uniform distribution of metallic Li on the Co-O-G SA surface. More importantly, when matched with a sulfur cathode, the resulting Co-O-G SA/lithium sulfur full batteries exhibited a high capacity of 1002 mAh.g(-1), improved kinetics with a small polarization of 191 mV, and an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.036% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 0.5C (1C = 1675 mA.g(-1)) with a steady Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. Therefore, this work provides novel insights into the coordination environment of single atoms for the chemistry of Li metal anodes for high-energy-density batteries.

However, dissolution of its lithiated product (lithium polysulfides) into the electrolyte limits the practical application of lithium sulfur batteries. Here we demonstrate that sulfur particles can be hermetically encapsulated by leveraging on the unique properties of two-dimensional materials such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The high flexibility and strong van der Waals force in MoS2 nanoflakes allows effective encapsulation of the sulfur particles and prevent its sublimation during in situ TEM studies. We observe that the lithium diffusivities in the encapsulated sulfur particles are in the order of 10(-17) m(2) Composite electrodes made from the MoS2-encapsulated sulfur spheres show outstanding electrochemical performance, with an initial capacity of 1660 mAh g(-1) and long cycle life of more than 1000 cycles.

While several two-dimensional (2D) materials have been deployed in recent years to mitigate these issues, their activity is strictly restricted to their edge-plane-based active sites. Herein, for the first time, we have explored a phase transformation phenomenon in a 2D material to enhance the number of active sites and electrocatalytic activity toward LiPS redox reactions. Detailed theoretical calculations demonstrate that phase transformation from the 2H to 1T ' phase in a MoSe2 material activates the basal planes that allow for LiPS adsorption. The corresponding transformation mechanism and LiPS adsorption capabilities of the as-formed 1T '-MoSe2 were elucidated experimentally using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Further, the electrochemical evaluation of phase-transformed MoSe2 revealed its strong electrocatalytic activity toward LiPS reduction and their oxidation reactions. The 1T '-MoSe2-based cathode hosts for sulfur later provide a superior cycling performance of over 250 cycles with a capacity loss of only 0.15% per cycle along with an excellent Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%.

In this work, strict constraint of sulfur to eradicate the polysulfide shuttling is realized in the nanostructure of carbon-coated metal sulfides instead of pure sulfur cathodes. The nanoparticles are composed of a carbon shell and iron disulfide core (FeS2@C), fabricated by the plasma evaporation method and postsulfurization. The Fe-S bonds in FeS2 chemically attract the sulfur atoms during their lithiation reaction, while the carbon shell physically blocks the sulfur loss within the enclosed construction. Owing to the remarkable dual constraint of S, the FeS2@C cathode delivers a stable specific capacity of 862 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles. The assembled battery cells exhibit stable electrochemical performance when they are operated safely in the temperature range from 60 to -25 degrees C.

J	Li, F; Zhao, JJ				Li, Fen; Zhao, Jijun			Atomic Sulfur Anchored on Silicene, Phosphorene, and Borophene for Excellent Cycle Performance of Li-S Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						atomic sulfur; silicene; phosphorene; borophene; intrinsic shuttle inhibition	THEORETICAL PREDICTION; DIRECTIONAL DIFFUSION; LITHIUM POLYSULFIDES; CHEMICAL ADSORPTION; ELEMENTAL-SULFUR; CATHODE; CARBON; ANODE; GRAPHENE; 1ST-PRINCIPLES	Dissolution of intermediate lithium polysulfides, (LiPS) is an inevitable obstacle for the solid sulfur-based cathode in Li-S batteries. For the first time, herein, atomic sulfur is incorporated into silicene, phosphorene, and borophene to intrinsically eliminate the dissolution of LiPS. The small molecular sulfur species are anchored on the silicene surface with stronger Si-S interaction than the P-S and B-S ones. Meanwhile, a high atomic sulfur coverage (63.1 wt %) is achieved in silicene and concomitantly stabilizes the silicene layer. For the S-3-covered silicene, a high theoretical capacity of 857 mA h g(-1) is achieved with slight dissolution of LiPS originated from the loss of interior S atoms that are not directly bound with silicene surface. By realizing the elemental S-2 coverage on silicene with large surface area, the Li+ ions can react fast with the S-2 species, leading to a high theoretical capacity of 891 mA h g(-1) without dissolution and migration of the intermediate LiPS. Most interestingly, the discharge products of atomic layer of lithium sulfides on silicene surface exhibit completely different behaviors from the traditional discharge products of solid Li2S,which can function as effective adsorption and activation sites for the conversion of LiPS from long chain to short chain by accelerated redox reaction. The present study gains some key insights into how the atomic sulfur contributes to the intrinsic shuttle inhibition and offers a feasible way to design the atomic sulfur-based cathode materials of Li-S batteries with better electrochemical performance.

But their practical use is still hindered by several issues including short lifespan, low efficiency and safety concern from the lithium anode. Polysulphide dissolution and insulating nature of sulphur are generally considered responsible for the capacity degradation. However, the detachment of discharge products, that is, highly polar lithium sulphides, from nonpolar carbon matrix (for example, graphene) has been rarely studied as one critical factor. Here we report the strongly covalent stabilization of sulphur and its discharge products on amino-functionalized reduced graphene oxide that enables stable capacity retention of 80% for 350 cycles with high capacities and excellent high-rate response up to 4 C. The present study demonstrates a feasible and effective strategy to solve the long-term cycling difficulty for lithium-sulphur batteries and also helps to understand the capacity decay mechanism involved.

The prepared Bi2O2CO3-rGO as modification composite was applied to construct voltammetric sensor for the first time. The Bi2O2CO3-rGO modified glassy carbon electrode (Bi2O2CO3-rGO/GCE) exhibited highly sensitive response to urapidil. The electrochemical behavior of urapidil was studied in detail. Under optimum conditions, a lower detection limit (1.5 x 10(-9) mol L-1) and wider linear range (5.0 x 10 mol L-1 x 10(-6) mol L-1) were achieved by the proposed sensor.

Understanding the Nature of Absorption/Adsorption in Nanoporous Polysulfide Sorbents for the Li-S Battery	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; COMPOSITE CATHODE MATERIALS; SULFUR BATTERY; HIGH-CAPACITY; CARBON; ELECTROLYTE; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; REDUCTION	The possibility of achieving high-energy, long-life storage batteries has tremendous scientific and technological significance. A prime example is the Li-S cell, which can offer a 3-5-fold increase in energy density compared with conventional Li-ion cells, at lower cost. Despite significant recent advances, there are challenges to its wide-scale implementation. Upon sulfur reduction, intermediate soluble lithium polysulfides readily diffuse into the electrolyte, causing capacity fading and poor Coulombic efficiency in the cell. Herein, we increase the capacity retention and cycle life of the Li-S cell through the use of nanocrystalline and mesoporous titania additives as polysulfide reservoirs and examine the role of surface adsorption vs pore absorption. We find that the soluble lithium polysulfides are preferentially absorbed within the pores of the nanoporous titania at intermediate discharge/charge. This provides the major factor in stabilizing capacity although surface binding (adsorption) also plays a more minor role. A cell containing TiO2 with a 5 nm pore diameter exhibited a 37% greater discharge capacity retention after 100 cycles than a cell without the titania additive, which was optimum compared to the other titania that were examined.

Energetically favorable structural motifs are utilized to design smaller representative molecular models of both PAN and SPAN for in-depth investigations. A zig-zag configuration with multiple kink sites is energetically favorable for PAN materials, with the carbon kink site being the most reactive site. To form SPAN, sulfur binds to this kink site, resulting in structures typically containing S=C double bonds at kink sites and S chains that bridge between neighboring PAN fragments. It is found that the formation of large sulfur rings is possible because they are flexible enough to accommodate their length to the shape of the PAN fragment.

Here, a new C/S cathode material comprising short-chain sulfur species (predominately S-2) confined in carbonaceous subnanometer and the unique charge mechanism for the subnano-entrapped S-2 cathodes are reported. The first charge-discharge cycle of the C/S cathode in the carbonate electrolyte forms a new type of thiocarbonate-like solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The SEI coated C/S cathode stably delivers approximate to 600 mAh g(-1) capacity over 4020 cycles (0.0014% loss cycle(-1)) at approximate to 100% Coulombic efficiency. Extensive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the discharged cathodes shows a new type of S-2 species and a new carbide-like species simultaneously, and both peaks disappear upon charging. These data suggest a new sulfur redox mechanism involving a separated Li+/S2- ion couple that precludes Li2S compound formation and prevents the dissolution of soluble sulfur anions. This new charge/discharge process leads to remarkable cycling stability and reversibility.

Although Li-O-2 batteries hold a great potential for large-scale electrochemical energy storage and electric vehicles, their implementation is lagging due to the complex reactions occurring at the cathode. Great effort has been applied to find practical cathodes through the incorporation of different materials acting as catalysts. Here we tap into the quantification of the environmental footprint of seven high-performance Li-O-2 batteries. The batteries were standardized to feed a 60 kWh electric vehicle. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is applied to determine and compare how different batteries and respective components contribute to environmental footprints, categorized in 18 groups. To get a bigger picture, results are compared with the environmental burdens of a reference lithium ion battery, reference sodium ion battery, and the average value of lithium-sulfur batteries. Overall, Li-O-2 batteries present lower environmental burdens in 9 impact categories, with similar impacts in 5 categories in comparison with lithium-sulfur and lithium ion batteries. With an average value of 55.76 kg.CO2 equiv in Global Warming Potential for the whole Li-O-2 battery, the cathode is the major contributor, with a relative weight of 44.5%. These results provide a road map to enable the practical design of sustainable aprotic Li-O-2 batteries within a circular economy perspective.

J	Yamauchi, E; Takeuchi, T; Sakaebe, H				Yamauchi, Erina; Takeuchi, Tomonari; Sakaebe, Hikari			Improvement of Cycling Capability of Li2S-FeS Composite Positive Electrode Materials by Surface Coating With Titanium Oxide	FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						high-energy-density battery; lithium-sulfur battery; iron sulfide; surface coating; titanium oxide	SULFUR; PERFORMANCE; TIO2; TEMPERATURE; BATTERIES; CATHODE	High-energy-density batteries are actively sought after for next-generation electric vehicle (EV) applications, triggering the search for sulfur-based positive electrode materials with high capacity for extended driving range. One of the primary issues of sulfur cathodes is the rapid capacity decay caused by the dissolution of sulfur in the electrolyte and the resulting parasitic reactions. This can be prevented by incorporating a suitable amount of carbon material into the sulfur electrodes, because of its inherent properties; however, introducing a large amount of low-density carbon materials will lead to a decrease in the energy density of the battery. Therefore, an alternative method to suppress sulfur dissolution is required for commercial applications. Recently, we developed a Fe-containing Li2S-based material (Li8FeS5) as the sulfur cathode; it has a relatively high initial discharge capacity (>700 mAh.g(-1)) and electric conductivity. However, rapid capacity degradation was observed during the initial several cycles, due to some unknown reactions between the electrolyte and Li8FeS5. In this study we demonstrate an effective method to improve the cycle performance of Li8FeS5 by coating its surface with a stabilizing material. We selected titanium oxide as the coating material, based on its high stability toward liquid electrolytes and its strong interaction with sulfur. Hence, we obtained TiOx-coated Li8FeS5 particles (Li8FeS5-TiOx) by a liquid-phase reaction. The transmission electron microscopy observation revealed that the Li8FeS5 particles were coated with several tens of nanometers of TiOx layers. The Li8FeS5-TiOx cells exhibited improved cycling performance with a carbonate electrolyte. We also observed that the capacity originating from an iron redox was not affected by coating during the cycling test; in contrast, the degradation of the cell capacity corresponding to the sulfur redox was suppressed significantly after coating with the TiOx layer. Thus, the surface reaction of Li8FeS5 with the electrolyte, which could be the main reason for the cycling degradation, was effectively suppressed by coating with the TiOx layer.

Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived carbon materials are considered to be efficient sulfur hosts to confine the polysulfides because of the unique porous structure and the heteroatom doping. However, a strong acid wash step is usually needed to remove the metal or metal oxide residual after pyrolysis, which will produce a large amount of acidic waste solution and increase the complexity of the synthetic process. Herein, instead of being removed, the uniformly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles in the pyrolytic polyhedra from zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is directly used as the metal source to prepare a new ZIF-8 coating layer. This novel structure possesses not only the unique inner porous structure and high conductivity of pyrolytic carbon, but also the extra protection from ZIF-8 layer with both physical confinement and chemisorption to polysulfides. The resulting cathode displays an initial capacity of 1410 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, and desirable cycling stability and rate capability are also obtained.

Microspherical particles are formed by spray drying of a mixed aqueous colloid of PAN nanoparticles and graphene nanosheets, followed by a simple heat treatment with elemental sulfur. The pPAN-S primary nanoparticles are wrapped homogeneously and loosely within a three-dimensional network of graphene nanosheets (GNS). The hierarchical pPAN-S@GNS composite shows a high reversible capacity of 1449.3 mAhg(sulfur)(-1) or 681.2 mAhg(composite)(-1) in the second cycle; after 300 cycles at a 0.2 C charge/discharge rate the capacity retention is 88.8% of its initial reversible value. Additionally, the coulombic efficiency (CE) during cycling is near 100 %, apart from in the first cycle, in which CE is 81.1 %. A remarkable capacity of near 700 mAhg(sulfur)(-1) is obtained, even at a high discharge rate of 10 C. The superior performance of pPAN-S@GNS is ascribed to the spherical secondary GNS structure that creates an electronically conductive 3D framework and also reinforces structural stability.

The SPANI has a high degree of interconnected nano-porous structures conducive to large sulfur loading and fast mass transportation. In addition, a disulfide chain on PANI is also functioned as the electrochemical redox component. While the main positively charged backbone chain in SPANI provides electron conductivity and electrostatic attraction force to stabilize polysulfide anions during cycling. As a result, the SPANI electrode demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 750 mA h g(-1) with 89.7% of capacity retention over 200 cycles at 0.3 C, and an excellent high-rate response up to 2 C over 200 cycles with a good sulfur utilization.

A special test cell was constructed to examine in-situ Raman spectra in the spectral range from 100 cm(-1) to 600 cm(-1) during charge and discharge in the voltage range of 1.5 V to 3.0 V. In order to assign the in-situ Raman data and to support the interpretation of the observed changes in the overall Raman-spectrum, several reference measurements on well-defined substances were conducted. The reference measurements included pure solvents, electrolytes and polysulfide solutions prepared from stoichiometric mixtures of S-8 and Li2S powders. The assignment of the observed Raman-spectra was further based on a comparison with purely theoretical data for the vibrational modes of the polysulfide di-anions S-n(2-) and radical mono-anions S-n(-) calculated at the B3PW91/6-311G(2df,p) level of density functional theory (DFT). The DFT data for the vibrational spectra, corrected for solvent effects in the framework of the polarizable continuum model (PCM), allowed an identification of several characteristic features in the in-situ Raman spectra.

Herein, we provide an environmental-friendly graphene exfoliating method with high efficiency and high quality that combines the microfluidization process (liquid phase) and supercritical carbon dioxide process (gas phase), namely the dual-phase exfoliating (DPE) method. The combination of effective tangential force (shearing force) and normal force (push and pull), which are originally from microfluidization and supercritical carbon dioxide process, respectively, maximizes the exfoliating efficiency. The DPE method offers a high yield of up to 70.25% for graphene preparation (941.04 g per day theoretically), while the graphene sheets could remain single or a few layers (> 80%) and around micron size. By molecular dynamic simulations, it is theoretically proved that carbon dioxide can intercalate between graphite layers and expand the interlayer spacing under supercritical conditions. This DPE method, by combining the advantages of different phase processes, provides an ideal process design perspective for large-scale preparation of other 2D materials.

In this method, the Keggin-type H4SiW12O40 (SiW12) is used as an electrocatalyst. During the reduction process, SiW12 transfers the electrons from the electrode to GO, leading to a deep reduction of GO in which the content of oxygen-containing groups is decreased to around 5%. Meanwhile, the strong adsorption effect between the SiW12 clusters and rGO nanosheets induces the spontaneous assembly of SiW12 on rGO in a uniformly dispersed state, forming a porous, powder-type nanocomposite. More importantly, the nanocomposite shows an enhanced capacity of 275mAhg(-1) as a cathode active material for lithium storage, which is 1.7 times that of the pure SiW12.

Using theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, the threshold value of the optical bistability of mono-layer third-order nonlincarity graphene can be tuned by changing its Fermi energy, relaxation time, twophoton absorption coefficient, and temperature. We demonstrate that the larger Fermi energy level, the higher temperature and the larger threshold value of the optical bistability. Further, a higher two-photon absorption coefficient corresponds to a higher low threshold of the bistability. Moreover, the relaxation time and two-photon absorption coefficient can significantly alter the light transmissivity of the graphene structure, although the light transmissivity is insensitive to the temperature of the graphene material. Results offer a theoretical basis for designing nanophotonic devices with micro-nano structure such as optical switches and optical sensors.

In this work, highly doped graphene nanosheets with tunable N and S codopants (NS-GNS) are prepared via a facile one-pot method and investigated in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). During the pyrolysis, the starting materials can form planar sacrificial-templates that serve for the growth of 2D graphene structure and further in-situ convert into rich N and S dopant species, successfully solving the general challenge of high doping level of multi-heteroatoms into the graphene matrix. Integrating the abundant N, S and O-induced electrochemical redox centers at different potentials, the NS-GNS electrode demonstrates a high reversible capacity of around 400 mAh g(-1). Particularly, the ultra-long cycle life of 10,000 cycles and good rate capability of the present NS-GNS electrode make it promising for practical application in large-scale energy storage.

Mesoporous MWCNT microballs with a three-dimensional interpenetrating network structure offer a promising solution to not only maximize the energy density but also guarantee high power capability. Furthermore, the high specific surface area (175.24 m(2) g(-1)) of the microballs provides large pore volumes suitable for effective sulfur impregnation. A sulfur-impregnated MWCNT cathode showed superior electrochemical cell performance for long-term and high rate capability. In particular, sulfur-impregnated MWCNT microball based electrodes have a significant advantage to secure a mechanically robust carbon structure with better electrical contact during cycling.

The effects of GO doping content on the morphology, structure and surface properties of UF membrane and the final NF membrane were studied comprehensively. The hydrophilic GO acted as a "bridge" between UF membrane and polyamide layer due to the "anchor effect", which significantly enhanced the interaction between base membrane and polyamide layer. The results revealed that with ultra-low GO doping content of 0.05 wt%, the final NF005 membrane exhibited a high selective separation capacity for Mg2+ and Li+ (S-Mg,S-Li approximate to 0.062), and the flux increased by about 119% compared with the pure NF0 membrane. Additionally, due to the high stability of membrane, the excellent separation capacity of NF005 membrane only changed slightly after 7-day cycle filtration test. Importantly, a small amount of GO doping greatly improved the permeability of both UF and NF membranes, which correspondingly improved the separation efficiency and accelerated the filtration rate. This work provides a new direction for designing membrane with high efficiency for Mg2+/Li+ separation, which is potential in the field of lithium extraction.

However, the synthesis of high-quality nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) with a controllable nitrogen configuration still faces considerable challenges. In this work, we present for the first time a simple method for the one-step synthesis of NG with ionic liquids (ILs) as precursors, which avoids the defects introduced by secondary doping and simplifies the process. Using 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (EMIM-dca) as the precursor, we obtained a high-quality NG with few defects (I-D/I-G is 0.83), nitrogen content (4.11 at%), and graphite-N proportion of 92% at a growth temperature of 1000 degrees C and field effect transistors (FETs) fabricated on SiO2/Si substrates using the NG exhibited typical n-type semiconductor behavior in air. Our findings bring more inspiration for the controllable growth of high-quality graphitic N-doped graphene, thereby promoting its application possibilities in numerous fields.

Typical load-displacement curves are obtained, and the effects of various factors including indenter radii, loading speeds, and aspect ratios of the graphene film on the simulation results are discussed. A formula describing the relationship between the load and indentation depth is obtained according to the molecular dynamics simulation results. Young's modulus and the strength of the single-layer graphene film are measured as about 1.0 TPa and 200 GPa, respectively. It is found that the graphene film ruptured in the central point at a critical indentation depth. The deformation mechanisms and dislocation activities are discussed in detail during the loading-unloading-reloading process. It is observed from the simulation results that once the loading speed is larger than the critical loading speed, the maximum force exerted on the graphene film increases and the critical indentation depth decreases with the increase of the loading speed.

Besides the complex electrochemical conversion mechanism there are negative side effects added to the system by application of solvent-based cathode preparation, such as chemical incompatibility caused by solvent contamination, sulfur evaporation and morphology change during drying as well as limited active material loading. Therefore we present a solvent-free, highly versatile pressing/thermal treatment method for the fast and reproducible production of mechanically stable and highly flexible freestanding carbon-sulfur composite cathode foils with tunable sulfur loading, high in-plane conductivity and enhanced cycling stability. Utilizing an optimized cathode composition consisting of sulfur, a porous carbon host material and a carbon nanotube conducting agent, a stable capacity >740 mA h g(-1)-S as well as high coulombic efficiency >96% was achieved over 160 cycles in our experiments at a moderate rate of C/10. Moreover, reversible cycling was possible up to a high rate of 1C due to the tuned carbon matrix properties as well as the highly conductive carbon nanotube percolation network. Thus not only a long-lasting electrical contact to insulating sulfur precipitates is provided but also the agglomeration of active material is restrained. To achieve even higher energy densities and improved corrosion resistance, the application of highly conductive freestanding cathode foils without a metallic current collector is a promising feature.

Their high porosity, versatile functionalities, diverse structures, and controllable chemical compositions offer immense possibilities in the search for adequate electrode materials for rechargeable batteries. Despite these advantageous features, MOFs and their derivatives as electrode materials face various challenging issues, which impede their practical applications. From this perspective, we present both the opportunities and challenges that MOFs/MOF composites and MOF-derived materials bring to rechargeable batteries, including lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-oxygen batteries, and sodium-ion batteries. By discussing the development of MOFs/MOF composites and MOF-derived materials in each battery system, some design principles that dominate the specific electrochemical behaviors are outlined, with the key requirements that a practical electrode should fulfill At the end, a basic guidance and future directions for further development are provided.

Herein, the use of simple sugar coating (alpha-D-glucose) is demonstrated on top of Li metal to halt the growth of Li dendrites and stabilize the SEI. The alpha-D-glucose layer possesses high surface and adhesive energies toward Li, which promote the homogenous stripping and plating of Li ions on top of the Li metal. Density functional theory reveals that Li-ion diffusion within the alpha-D-glucose layer is governed by hopping around the bare sides of the O atoms and along the apparent passages formed by the glucose molecules. Stable cycling performance is achieved when combining alpha-D-glucose-coated Li (G vertical bar Li) anodes with sulfur- and LiFePO4-based cathodes in both LiTFSI (ether) and LiPF6 (carbonate) electrolyte systems. A G vertical bar Li-based symmetrical cell operates at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) and areal capacity of 1 mAh cm(-2) displays a stable overpotential profile for over 9 months (7000 h) of continuous charge/discharge cycling.

The microstructure, hardness, transverse rupture strength, fracture toughness and thermal conductivity of cemented carbide were investigated. The results show that graphene was distributed as a reinforcement at the Co phase, WC/WC interface and WC/Co interface. The hardness of the cemented carbide decreased slightly with the increase of graphene content. The transverse rupture strength increased first and then decreased with the increase of graphene content, and reached 2321.2 MPa when the content of graphene is 0.05 wt%. The fracture toughness increased to 13.1 MPa m(1/2) after adding 0.05 wt% graphene. The thermal conductivity of the sample with 0.05 wt% graphene was greatly improved.

The composites are prepared by decomposition under the reducing atmosphere and further selenization of Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) precursor. The metallic Co nanoparticles formed during the reduction process play a key role in catalyzing the in-situ formation of graphitic carbon and extrusion of CNTs from the surface of the composite nanocube using carbon sources originated from organic ligands in ZIF-67 templates. The direct selenization process of ZIF-67 produces the composite nanocubes (CoSe2@AC) of CoSe2 and amorphous carbon. The specific discharge capacities of the CoSe2@NPGC/CNTs and CoSe2@AC composite nanocubes after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1) were 424 and 100 mA h g(-1), respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance of CoSe2@N-PGC/CNTs composite nanocubes are attributed to their unique compositional and structural features. Especially, the carbon matrix with CNTs could not only effectively inhibit volume expansion during cycling but also maintain the integrity of the structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Further, the periodic array of graphene ribbon is investigated using a finite-difference time-domain simulation and the coupled-mode theory. The results show that the graphene array exhibits a typical surface plasma double-resonance effect in the mid-infrared band. Its periodic array structure can enhance the resonance effect of graphene surface plasma local field. The resonant wavelengths, electrical field energy, attenuation rate, and lifetime of the resonance mode of graphene surface plasma arc analyzed. The simulation results demonstrate that the resonance wavelength can be tuned from 16.81 to 11.13 mu m when the graphene Fermi energy is increased from 0.1 to 0.8 eV and that the plasma lifetime can be regulated from 21 to 223 fs when the graphene carrier mobility is increased from 0.1 to 1.0 m(2) . (V . s)(-1). Furthermore, the quality factor increases nonlinearly from 0.11 to 0.19 when the refractive index of the superstrate is increased from 1 to 2. The research methods and conclusions of this study arc useful for designing graphene plasma devices.

Favorable role of heterojunction in trimetallic Fe-Co-Cu phosphides on nitrogen-doped carbon materials for hydrogen evolution	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Cobalt phosphide; Copper phosphide; Graphene; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Iron phosphide	OXYGEN REDUCTION REACTION; BIMETALLIC PHOSPHIDES; ENERGY-STORAGE; EFFICIENT; CATALYSTS; FRAMEWORK; ALKALINE; ARRAY; NANOARRAYS; NANOSHEETS	Development of high-efficiency and cost-efficient electrocatalysts is vital for hydrogen generation by electrochemical water splitting. Here we report a facile two-step approach to fabricate trimetallic Fe/Co/Cu-based phosphides embedded onto nitrogen-doped carbon-graphene (FeCoCuP@NC). The FeCoCuP@NC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with low overpotential and durable long-term stability in both acidic and alkaline conditions. To reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), FeCoCuP@NC requires overpotential of 80 and 169 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The superior HER performance of FeCoCuP@NC could be attributed to the formation of heterojunctions between different phosphides and the synergetic action between active phosphides and N-doped carbon-graphene matrix. This work affords a feasible strategy to fabricate trimetallic transition metal phosphides embedded onto carbonaceous materials using metal-organic frameworks as precursors for energy and environmental applications.

Although functional graphene nanomaterials can serve as attractive liquid nanoink platforms for the fabrication of bioelectronics, scalable synthesis of graphene nanoink with an integration of high colloidal stability, water processability, electrochemical activity, and especially bioactivity remains a major challenge. Here, a facile and scalable synthesis of supramolecular-functionalized multivalent graphene nanoink (mGN-ink) via [2+1] nitrene cycloaddition is reported. The mGN-ink unambiguously displays a well-defined and flat 2D morphology and shows good water processability and bioactivity. The uniquely chemical, physical, and biological properties of mGN-ink endow the constructed bioelectronic films and nanofibers with high flexibility and durability, suitable conductivity and electrochemical activity, and most importantly, good cellular compatibility and a highly efficient control of stem-cell spreading and orientation. Overall, for the first time, a water-processable and bioactive mGN-ink is developed for the design of flexible and electrochemically active bioelectronic composites and devices, which not only presents manifold possibilities for electronic-cellular applications but also establishes a new pathway for adapting macroscopic usages of graphene nanomaterials in bionic, biomedical, electronic, and even energy fields.

The device is composed of resonant ring graphene with an open top layer, a thick PMMA spacer layer and a Cu substrate mirror layer, which has simple structural characteristics. By FDTD simulation method, the numerical results show that perfect absorption is achieved at resonance wavelengths lambda(A) = 39.30 mu m and lambda(B) = 62.00 mu m, and the absorption rates are 99.55% and 99.64%, respectively. By adjusting the geometric parameters of graphene array, changing the structural period P and PMMA dielectric thickness, the absorber can achieve perfect absorption. In addition, the resonance wavelength and absorption peak of the absorber can be effectively tuned by controlling the chemical potential, relaxation time and dielectric constant inside the absorber. At last, we exposed the structure to different environmental refractive indices, and calculated the corresponding maximum sensitivities of the two resonant modes as SA = 13.82 mu m/RIU and S-B = 21.47 mu m/RIU. The maximum figure of merit are FOM1 = 4.4870 RIU-1 and FOM2 = 3.5148 RIU-1 respectively. Therefore, the design of graphenebased tunable perfect metamaterial absorber proposed in this study can be applied to photodetectors, sensors and other fields.

There are, however, several challenges limiting their practical applications, which include low coulombic efficiency, the uncontrollable growth of dendrites and poor rate capability. Here, a rational design of 3D structured lithium metal anodes comprising of in-situ growth of cobalt-decorated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes on continuous carbon nanofibers is demonstrated via electrospinning. The porous and free-standing scaffold can enhance the tolerance to stresses resulting from the intrinsic volume change during Li plating/stripping, delivering a significant boost in both charge/discharge rates and stable cycling performance. A binary Co-Li alloying phase was generated at the initial discharge process, creating more active sites for the Li nucleation and uniform deposition. Characterization and density functional theory calculations show that the conductive and uniformly distributed cobalt-decorated carbon nanotubes with hierarchical structure can effectively reduce the local current density and more easily absorb Li atoms, leading to more uniform Li nucleation during plating. The current work presents an advance on scalable and cost-effective strategies for novel electrode materials with 3D hierarchical microstructures and mechanical flexibility for lithium metal anodes.

J	Wang, WD; Zhang, HY; Li, S; Zhan, YJ				Wang, Weidong; Zhang, Haiyan; Li, Shuai; Zhan, Yongjie			Influences of ambient temperature, surface fluctuation and charge density on wettability properties of graphene film	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						graphene film; molecular dynamics; ambient temperature; surface fluctuation; charge density; wettability	THERMAL-PROPERTIES; RELAXATION PROPERTIES; ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; CONTACT; ENERGY; TERM	Some molecular dynamics simulations focusing on the interactions between graphene films and water droplets are carried out in this article to investigate the fluid-solid interfacial behavior of surface wettability. The wettability of an ideal graphene film is investigated at room temperature at the beginning of the simulations, then the influences of ambient temperature, surface fluctuation and charge density of the graphene film on the wetting behaviors of water droplets on the film are also discussed from three points of view, namely the interaction energy of the graphene and the water droplet, the mass density of water and the water contact angle on the graphene film. The simulation results indicate that the ideal graphene film is slightly hydrophobic and that both the ambient temperature and the fluctuation of the graphene film play a negative role during the wetting processes. The observations also show that, once charged, the wetting property of graphene changes massively, from slightly hydrophobic to super-hydrophilic.
