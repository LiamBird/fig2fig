Mn3O4 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 20nm are uniformly adhered to a substrate of graphene sheets. The electrochemical properties of the composite for supercapacitor electrode in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The GM composite exhibits more remarkable capacitance (270.6 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)) compared with the pure Mn3O4 (132.0 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1)). After 1500 cycles, the retention rates of the composite and pure Mn3O4 at 2.0 A g(-1) are 91% and 71.4%, respectively. The good electrochemical performance of the GM composite could be attributed to the decreased agglomeration, enhanced conductivity, and the robust structure as a result of introducing graphene. These results render a new reasonable design of preparing nanomaterials with complex structures for supercapacitor applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To date, a fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanisms of lithium-metal anode is lacking. It is shown that (i) by employing a specifically designed electrolyte, the lithium-metal anode degradation can be significantly reduced, resulting in a superior, high-rate battery performance and (ii) by combining advanced, 3D chemical analysis with X-ray diffraction, the properties of the lithium-metal anode can be effectively monitored as a function of cycling, which is critical in understanding its degradation mechanisms. These findings suggest that the crystallinity of the impurity phases formed in the lithium-metal anode via chemical reactions with the electrolyte is the dominant degradation factor. It is shown both experimentally and by computational modeling that by employing electrolyte additives containing metal ions that have lower reactivity with sulfur than lithium (e.g., copper, silver, and gold), the crystallinity of the impurity phases can be significantly reduced, resulting in a stable lithium-metal anode. A pathway to develop a practical, affordable, environmentally compatible, rechargeable Li-S battery system is offered, and insights to develop other high-energy-density battery systems based on the high-capacity lithium-metal anode are provided.

However, their synthesis remains a great challenge with conventional strategies. In this work, we demonstrate that hollow carbon nanospheres of unprecedentedly small sizes (down to similar to 32.5 nm and with thickness of similar to 3.9 nm) can be produced on a large scale by a templating process in a unique reverse micelle system. Reverse micelles enable a spatially confined Stober process that produces uniform silica nanospheres with significantly reduced sizes compared with those from a conventional Stober process, and a subsequent well-controlled sol-gel coating process with a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin on these silica nanospheres as a precursor of the hollow carbon nanospheres. Owing to the short diffusion length resulting from their hollow structure, as well as their small size and microporosity, these hollow carbon nanospheres show excellent capacity and cycling stability when used as anode materials for lithium/sodium-ion batteries.

Charge-coupled devices are widely used imaging technologies. However, their speed is limited due to the complex readout process, which involves sequential charge transfer between wells, and their spectral bandwidth is limited due to the absorption limitations of silicon. Here we report graphene charge-injection photodetectors. The devices have a deep-depletion silicon well for charge integration, single-layer graphene for non-destructive direct readout and multilayer graphene for infrared photocharge injection. The photodetectors offer broadband imaging from ultraviolet (around 375 nm) to mid-infrared (around 3.8 mu m), a conversion gain of 700 pA per electron, a responsivity above 0.1 A W-1 in the infrared region and a fast response time under 1 mu s.

An XRD pattern proved the formation of face-centered cubic TiC, and TEM images showed the obtained TiC nanoparticles with an average size of approximately 50 nm. In addition, the separator coated with TiC nanoparticles as an active material of interlayer effectively mitigates the shuttling problem by taming the polysulfides in Li-S batteries compared with a traditional celgard separator. The assembled cell realizes good cycling stability with 501 mAh g(-1) and a low capacity fading of 0.1% per cycle after 300 cycles at 1 C due to high utilization of the sulfur-based active species.

The viscous regime has recently been observed in graphene by nonlocal transport experiments and mapping of the Poiseuille profile. Herein, we probe the current-induced surface potential maps of graphene field-effect transistors with moderate mobility using scanning probe microscopy at room temperature. We discover micrometer-sized large areas appearing close to charge neutrality that show current-induced electric fields opposing the externally applied field. By estimating the local scattering lengths from the gate dependence of local in-plane electric fields, we find that electron-electron scattering dominates in these areas as expected for viscous flow. Moreover, we suppress the inverted fields by artificially decreasing the electron-disorder scattering length via mild ion bombardment. These results imply that viscous electron flow is omnipresent in graphene devices, even at moderate mobility.

GO nanosheets were deposited on glassy carbon (GC) electrode by electrophoretic deposition (EPD), the silver ions were electrochemically reduced to silver particles, uniformly dispersed in the GO nanosheets. The modified electrodes morphology and microstructure were characterized by AFM, SEM, Raman, XRD and elemental mapping. The catalytic behavior during oxygen reduction on the modified electrodes was studied in alkaline medium. This research revealed that the onset potential of oxygen reduction on the GO+Ag electrode shifted to the positive direction by 228 mV compared with the GC electrode; the reduction current density on the GO+Ag electrode was found to be 7.564 mA center dot cm(-2), which is 3.4 times as that of the GC electrode.

The particle size and coverage density of Fe3O4 on graphene sheets were controlled by adjusting the molar ratio of graphite oxide (GO) and Fe (II) ions. Spherical Fe3O4 nanoparticles were decorated densely and homogeneously on the graphene sheets. Galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling of the optimized Fe3O4/graphene composite exhibited a reversible specific capacity more than 963 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles without detectable capacity fading at the current density of 100 mA g(-1). Even after 50 cycles at various rates from 100 to 2500 mA g(-1), it still maintained the specific capacity of 979 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). The highly improved performance of Fe3O4/graphene composite could be attributed to the pinning effect of hydroxyl/epoxy groups on Fe atoms of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the excellent interfacial interaction between Fe3O4 and graphene.

The grain size and compactness of hybrid perovskite are key factors affecting the performance of photoelectric devices. The photocurrent and photoresponsivity of these devices are relatively low because of the rapidly recombined photoexcited electron-hole pairs in hybrid perovskite. Herein, we develop a facile two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to synthesize a high-quality van der Waals (vdWs) MAPbI(3)/graphene heterostructure for high-performance image sensor. We introduced inorganic sources (PbI2) to vdWs epitaxially grown PbI2 film on a seamless graphene monolayer film template through CVD. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was then reintroduced to prepare the vdWs MAPbI(3)/graphene heterostructure. The MAPbI(3) layer is composed of densely packed, large-size grains and displays a smooth surface. High photoresponsivity of 10 (7) A/W is achieved in the corresponding photodetector. Inspired by the human visual system, we designed a flexible photodetector array containing (24 x 24) pixels, achieving perfect image recognition and color discrimination. Our study may greatly facilitate the construction of high-performance optoelectronic devices in artificial retina, biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication.

However, sulfur cathodes have the disadvantage of serious cyclability issues due to the dissolution of polysulfides that form as intermediate products during discharge/charge cycling. Filling sulfur into the micropores of porous carbon is an effective method to suppress its dissolution. Although microporous carbon-supported sulfur cathodes show an electrochemical behavior different from that of the conventional sulfur ones, the corresponding reaction mechanism is not clearly understood. In this study, we focused on clarifying the reaction mechanism of microporous carbon-supported sulfur cathodes by operando soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In the microporous carbon support, sulfur was present as smaller fragments compared to conventional sulfur. During the first discharge process, the sulfur species in the microporous carbon were initially reduced to S-6(2-) and S-2(2-) and then to Li2S. The S-6(2-) and S-2(2-) species were observed first, with S-2(2-) being the main polysulfide species during the discharge process, while Li2S was produced in the final discharge process. The narrow pores of microporous carbon prevent the dissolution of polysulfides and influence the reaction mechanism of sulfur cathodes.

To explore the molecular mechanism, RTILs/carbon pieces mixture was investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in this work. Rigid and flexible carbon pieces in the form of graphene with different thicknesses and carbon nanotubes in different sizes were dispersed in a representative RTIL 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium dicyanamide ([Bmim][DCA]). This study demonstrated that the diffusion coefficients of RTILs in the presence of flexible carbons are similar to those of bulk RTILs at varying temperatures, which is in contrast to the decreased diffusion of RTILs in the presence of rigid carbons. In addition, interfacial ion number density at rigid carbon surfaces was higher than that at flexible ones, which is correlated with the accessible external surface area of carbon pieces. The life time of cation-anion pair in the presence of carbon pieces also exhibited a dependence on carbon flexibility. RTILs with dispersed rigid carbon pieces showed longer ion pair life time than those with flexible ones, in consistence with the observation in diffusion coefficients. This work highlights the necessity of including the carbon flexibility when performing MD simulation of RTILs in the presence of dispersed carbon pieces in order to obtain the reliable dynamical and interfacial structural properties.

The interactions of GO (with a concentration fixed at 0.10 g/L) with typical cationic, anionic, and neutral surfactants, dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and Triton X-100 (TX-100) were explored using several methods, including surface tension (ST), conductivity, zeta-potential, hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR), and isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC). Several approaches were adopted to confirm the different adsorption behaviors between three surfactants with different charged head groups and the negatively charged GO in different aspects. After comprehensive consideration, it was deduced that the interaction between DTAB and GO was strongest mainly because of electrostatic attraction supplemented by hydrophobic interaction; this was followed the SDS-GO and TX-100-GO interactions for which the hydrophobic interaction played the main role in the adsorption process. The probable adsorption patterns of each surfactant-GO pair were proposed and are presented at the end of the paper. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Se molecules are chemically bonded and physical encapsulated by carbonized PAN-CNT composite (CNFs-CNT), which leads to prevent the dissolution of polyselenide intermediates in carbonate based electrolyte. When directly used as flexible free-standing cathode material for Li-Se batteries in low cost carbonate-based electrolyte, the Se@CNFs-CNT electrode exhibits improved cyclability (517 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1)) and rate capability (485 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)). Moreover, when tested as sodium batteries, it maintains a reversible capacity of 410 mAh g(-1) after 240 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). The superior electrochemical performance (especially at high rates) of Se@CNFs-CNT is attributed to synergistic effect of the additive of CNT, the well confine of Se in the CNFs-CNT matrix through chemical bonding and the 3D interconnected carbon nanofibers (CNFs). This simple yet efficient process thus provides a promising route towards fabrication of a variety of high performance flexible Li-Se and Na-Se batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, poor cyclability and rate performance of Sb2O3 derived from a large volume change during insertion/desertion reactions as well as a sluggish kinetic process restrict its practical application. Herein, we report a facile amorphous-to-crystalline strategy to synthesize a densely packed Sb2O3 nanosheet-graphene aerogel as a novel anode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). This Sb2O3/graphene composite displays a reversible capacity as high as 657.9 mA h even after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1), along with an excellent rate capacity of 356.8 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1). The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of densely packed Sb2O3 nanosheets and graphene aerogel, which serves as both a robust support and stable buffer layer to maintain the structural stability of the nanocomposite, and enhances the electrode kinetics of electrolyte diffusion and electron transfer simultaneously. Hence, this densely-packed two-dimensional Sb2O3 nanosheet graphene aerogel can be a promising anode material for rechargeable SIBs due to its facile synthesis process and outstanding electrochemical performance.

Herein, based on the possible interactions vith LiPSs, Ce2O2S with unique O Ce S bindings is proposed to be used as a promising carrier additive and a 2D Ce2O2S/C composite is synthesized via a one-facile NaCl-template method and subsequent sulffiration under 700 degrees C. The 2D Ce2O2S/C exhibits a stronger adsorption capa-bility than CeO2/C through the adsorption test for Li2S6. Combined with)CPS and DFT results, the su PerioritY is originated from the formation of S S and Li S bonds between LiPSs and the lattice S on the surface of Ce2O2S. The 2D Ce2O2S/C composite also exhibits a better catalytic ability than CeO2 according to the change of the free energies of the polysialfides during the discharge process, which coincides with the lower oxidation potential for Li2S2/Li2S transition by cyclic voltammetry. Resultantly, the cathodes using the Ce2O2S/C composite as a carrier manifest an enhanced rate and cycling performances. Hence, our work paves a phenomenon wherein Ce2O2S with O-Ce-S bindings is more tieneficial to improve the cycling stability of Li S batteries than CeO2 containing single Ce-O bonds, which may be also suitable for other kinds of metallic sulfur oxide compounds.

Such carbon hosts can limit active species loss and enhance electronic conductivity throughout the entire framework. Herein, a synthesis approach of internal gridded hollow carbon spheres is developed from solid polymer spheres rather than originally gridded polymer spheres under a controlled pyrolysis micro-environment. The crucial point of this approach is the fabrication of a silica fence around solid polymer spheres, under which the free escaping of the pyrolysis gas will be partly impeded, thus offering a reconstitution opportunity for an internal structure of solid polymer spheres. As a result, the interior of carbon spheres is sculptured into a gridded hollow structure with microporous skin. Furthermore, the size and density of carbon-bridge grids can be modulated by altering the crosslinking degree of polymer spheres and varying pyrolysis conditions. Such gridded hollow carbon spheres show good performance as sulfur hosts for Li-S battery.

The thin film was proved to be composed of high-quality few-layer GNSs with a typical size of similar to 6 nm. With a turn-on field of similar to 2.85 V/mu m, an emission current density of similar to 53.9 mu A/cm(2) was obtained at an electric field of 4.2 V/mu m. Based on the experimental data, the enhancement factor of few-layer GNS/SiNPA was calculated to be similar to 2700 according to the Fowler-Nordheim theory. The cold cathode also showed higher emission stability than vertically standing graphene at low operating voltages. For comparison, GNS/SiNPA with multi-layer GNSs was prepared and its turn-on field was obtained as high as 8.5 V/mu m. The origin of the high emission performance was attributed to numerous emission sites formed at the edges of GNSs, unique structure and morphology of GNS/Si-NPA, and low electric resistance of GNSs. Our results might have provided an alternative approach for fabricating Si-based low-voltage cold cathodes with high device performances.

However, the two-dimensional island nucleation-growth process of lithium sulfide leads to a thick insulating film covering the electrode, inducing slow electrons transfer and mass-transfer of ions and liquid sulfur species in working Li-S cells. Here, we demonstrate a bio-inspired strategy of constructing ant-nest-like hierarchical porous ultrathin carbon nanosheet networks with the implants of metallic nanoparticles electrocatalysts (HPC-MEC) as efficient nanoreactors enabling rapid mass transfer, via a simple and green NaCl template. Such nanoreactors with a large active surface area could effectively anchor polysulfides for mitigating the shuttle effect, facilitating uniformly thin Li2S film, and promoting the mass transfer for fast sulfur species conversions. This helps contribute to a continuously high sulfur utilization in Li-S batteries with the HPC-MEC reactors. As a typical exhibition, cobalt embedded hierarchical porous carbon (HPC-Co) could realize to deliver a remarkably high specific capacity of 1,540.6 mAh center dot g(-1), an excellent rate performance of 878.8 mAh center dot g(-1) at 2 C, and high area capacity of 11.6 mAh center dot cm(-2) at a high sulfur load of 10 mg center dot cm(-2) and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 mu L center dot mg(-1).

The carbon dots are conjugated graphite nuclei with developed groups on the surface. OH- acts as an activation agent to induce changes in carbon nuclei and surface properties, leading to a high percentage of C=O, CN=C, and C=C groups on carbon dots, which are crucial for n-pi* and pi-pi* transitions that contribute to emission at a long wavelength. Na+ is helpful in conquering quenching and favorable for the enhanced emission. When it is embedded into a matrix of PVA and boric acid, the composite exhibits obvious room-temperature property phenomena (RTP) that can be easily recognized by the naked eye for up to 12 s with a lifetime of up to 623 ms. The N and O atoms favor the facilitation of intersystem crossing (ISC) to effectively populate triplet excitons, which contributes to the RTP with a low energy gap. The carbon dots can also act as electron donors and enable a 184% capacitance increase in graphene oxide. The prepared carbon dots exhibit potential applications in the security, sensing, and energy storage fields.

The tribological behavior of P-GP/EP composites was investigated by wear testing machine and micro-scratch tester from macroscales and microscales, respectively. Meanwhile, the tensile strength and microhardness were also measured, and the fracture toughness of the composites was evaluated through micro scratch. The results showed that the friction and wear properties of P-GP/EP composites were improved both in macroscales and microscales, and the results of wear resistance were consistent under macro and micro tests. The wear rate in macroscale and volume loss in microscale were 76.76% and 51.34% lower than those of pure EP, respectively. The tensile strength, hardness and fracture toughness of the composites were also improved by the addition of P-GP. The fracture toughness of epoxy composites could be accurately evaluated based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM).

TiO2 nanoparticles can be anchored on the GO sheets via the abundant oxygen containing functional groups such as epoxy, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups on the GO sheets. Using the TiO2 photocatalyst, the GO was photocatalytically reduced under UV illumination, leading to the production of TiO2-reduced graphene oxide (TiO2-RGO) nanocomposite. The as prepared TiO2, TiO2-GO, and TiO2-RGO nanocomposite were used to fabricate lithium ion batteries (LIBs) as the active anode materials and their corresponding lithium ion insertion/extraction performance was evaluated The resultant LIBs of the TiO2-RGO nanocomposite possesses more stable cyclic performance, larger reversible capacity, and better rate capability, compared with that of the pure TiO2 and TiO2-GO samples. The electrochemical and materials characterization suggest that the graphene network provides efficient pathways for electron transfer, and the TiO2 nanoparticles prevent the restacking of the graphene nanosheets, resulting in the improvement in both electric conductivity and specific capacity, respectively. This work suggests that the TiO2 based photocatalytic method could be a simple, low-cost, and efficient approach for large-scale production of anode materials for lithium ion batteries.

Here, an interlayer-confined molecular assembly method is presented for constructing all-graphitic multilaminate membranes (MMG subset of rGO), which are composed of monolayer mesoporous graphene (MMG) sandwiched between reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets. Hybrid assembly of iron-oleate complexes and organically modified GO sheets enables the preferential assembly of iron-oleate precursors at the interlayer space of densely stacked GO, driven by the like-pair molecular van der Waals interactions. Confined pyrolysis of iron-oleate complexes at GO interlayers leads to close-packed, carbon-coated Fe3O4 nanocrystal arrays, which serve as intermediates to template the subsequent formation of MMG subset of rGO membranes. To demonstrate their application potentials, MMG subset of rGO membranes are exploited as dual-functional interlayers to boost the performance of Li-S batteries by concurrently suppressing the shuttle of polysulfides and the growth of Li dendrites. This work showcases the capability of molecular-based hybrid assembly for synthesizing multilayer mesostructured graphene with high packing density and its use in electrochemical energy applications.

Herein, a concept that the electrode polarization can be reduced through the fabrication of 3D ordered interconnected nanostructure in the electrode is put forward. A nitrogen-doped carbon photonic crystal (NCPC) with the ordered interconnected nanostructure is used in the electrode to prove the concept. NCPC can provide a fast charge transfer rate along the thickness direction and a uniform distribution for electrons and lithium ions, resulting in diminishing the concentration polarization and concentration gradient. When NCPC works for lithium-sulfur battery, the thick electrode achieves a fast charge transfer rate and a small voltage gap as well as the thin electrode. The 200 mu m thick sulfur cathode obtains a specific capacity (87%) as high as 100 mu m thick sulfur cathode. In contrast, the capacity ratio of the electrode made by the traditional coating method is only 45%.

Heteroatom co-doping is an effective method for the modulation of the physical and chemical properties of two-dimensional materials. This study explored the structural stability, electronic structures, and optical properties of boron and phosphorus co-doped TTG using first-principles calculations. TTG was doped with B and P atoms (BP) at different positions considering 13 different configurations. Pristine TTG has a band gap of 1.89 eV, and all BP co-doped TTG (TTG/BP) systems remain semiconducting with band gaps that gradually decrease with increasing doping concentration. For a given doping concentration, the TTG/BP-ortho systems had a narrower band gap than the corresponding TTG/BP-para systems. The TTG and TTG/BP systems exhibited significant optical anisotropy. In the infrared region, BP co-doping increased the absorption coefficient, and the reflectance and refractive index increased with increasing doping concentration, except for the vertical component of the TTG/BP-ortho system. In the visible region, the absorption coefficient, reflectance, and refractive index decreased with increasing doping concentration for the vertical component, and the peaks were red-shifted from the near-ultraviolet region to the visible region. In the near-ultraviolet region, the reflectance also decreased with increasing doping concentration. The BP co-doping concentration can regulate the electronic structures and optical properties of the TTG, showing that the BP co-doped TTG has potential for application in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.

J	Shang, M; Sun, YT				Shang, Miao; Sun, Yongtao			Improved electrochemical performance of Li-S battery via using mesoporous MnO(2)nanofibers to inhibit the polysulfide diffusion	IONICS			English	Article						Cathode; Polysulfide; Electrochemical performance; Inhibiting	DOPED CARBON NANOFIBERS; ELECTRODE MATERIAL; CATHODE MATERIALS; SULFUR; COMPOSITE; NANOTUBES; NITROGEN; NANOSPHERES; MATRIX; HOST	The migration of the soluble polysulfide has become the main obstacle for the application of the Li-S battery for commercialization. Therefore, designing the suitable cathode host materials for the Li-S battery is the main research topic for the researchers worldwide. In our work, mesoporous MnO(2)nanofibers are prepared and designed as the host materials for the element sulfur. The as-prepared MnO2/S composite shows much higher specific capacity and superior cycle stability during the electrochemical process. The excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the presence of the mesoporous MnO(2)nanofibers, which could efficiently inhibit the migration of the soluble polysulfide in the electrolyte. As a result, the as-prepared MnO2/S composites exhibit initial specific capacity of 1502 mAh g(-1)at 0.1 C. Besides, the specific capacity value of the MnO2/S electrode is as high as 1205 mAh g(-1)after 200 cycles with only capacity retention of 89% at 0.2 C.

J	Andritsos, EI; Rossi, K				Andritsos, Eleftherios, I; Rossi, Kevin			Accelerating the theoretical study of Li-polysulfide adsorption on single-atom catalysts via machine learning approaches	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Early Access						adsorption; DFT; Li-S batteries; machine learning; single-atom catalysts	ENCODING CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; DESIGN; CONVERSION; DISCOVERY; ARGYRODITES; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; GRAPHENE; KINETICS; ENERGY	Li-S batteries are a promising alternative to Li-ion batteries, offering large energy storage capacity and wide operating temperature range. However, their performance is heavily affected by the Li-polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling. Computational screening of LiPS adsorption on single-atom catalyst (SAC) substrates is of great aid to the design of Li-S batteries which are robust against the LiPS shuttling from the cathode to the anode and the electrolyte. To facilitate this process, we develop a machine learning (ML) protocol to accelerate the systematic mapping of dominant local energy minima found with calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT), and, in turn, fast screening of LiPS adsorption properties on SACs. We first validate the approach by probing the potential energy surface for LiPS adsorbed on graphene decorated with a Fe-N-4-C SAC. We identify minima whose binding energies are better or on par with the one previously reported in the literature. We then move to analyze the adsorption trends on Zn-N-4-C SAC and observe similar adsorption strength and behavior with the Fe-N-4-C SAC, highlighting the good predictive power of our protocol. Our approach offers a comprehensive and computationally efficient alternative to conventional approaches studying LiPS adsorption.

We predict that an off-resonant circularly polarized light (CPL) drives chirally stacked N-layer graphene into a Floquet Chern insulators (FCIs), aka quantum anomalous Hall insulators, with tunable high Chern number C-F = +/- N and large gaps. A topological phase transition between such a FCI and a valley Hall (VH) insulator with high valley Chern number C-v = +/- N induced by a voltage gate can be engineered by the parameters of the CPL and voltage gate. We propose a topological domain wall between the FCI and VH phases, along which perfectly valley-polarized N-channel edge states propagate unidirectionally without backscattering.

Considering the most recent research activities, this comprehensive review first concentrates on the characterization and synthesis particulars of chemistry-based strategies for several state-of-the-art 2D holey nanoarchitectures, including holey graphene, nitrogenated holey carbon networks (C2N), holey graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and carbon nanomeshes, as well as 2D holey metal oxides, nitrides, sulfides, phosphides, hydroxides, selenides, carbides, carbonates, oxyfluorides, and NASICON-type structures. The pros and cons of each method for designing in-plane nanoperforations are also highlighted. Subsequently, we discuss the electrochemical properties for next-generation batteries including Li-O2, Zn-air, Li-CO2, Li-S, Li-Se, Li-SexSy, and K-ion batteries, while comprehensively evaluating all the parameters that help in improving their performance owing to the existence of the introduced in-plane holes. Finally, we emphasize the substantial limitations and challenges to facilitate further research and development. This comprehensive review might provide a directional, prompt guide for the designation and fabrication of additional innovative holey nanostructures for emerging applications. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment	[Nazarian-Samani, Masoud; Haghighat-Shishavan, Safa; Nazarian-Samani, Mahboobeh; Kim, Kwang-Bum] Yonsei Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 134 Sinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Nazarian-Samani, Masoud; Kashani-Bozorg, Seyed Farshid] Univ Tehran, Sch Met & Mat Engn, Coll Engn, Tehran 111554563, Iran; [Ramakrishna, Seeram] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mech Engn, 9 Engn Dr 1, Singapore 117576, Singapore		Nazarian-Samani, M; Kim, KB (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 134 Sinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea.; Nazarian-Samani, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Sch Met & Mat Engn, Coll Engn, Tehran 111554563, Iran.; Ramakrishna, S (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mech Engn, 9 Engn Dr 1, Singapore 117576, Singapore.	masoud.nazarian@gmail.com; seeram@nus.edu.sg; kbkim@yonsei.ac.kr	Haghighat-Shishavan, Safa/AGC-6268-2022; Ramakrishna, Seeram/AAY-4113-2021; Nazarian-Samani, Masoud/L-1879-2015; Ramakrishna, Seeram/E-5186-2011	Haghighat-Shishavan, Safa/0000-0002-6085-9242; Ramakrishna, Seeram/0000-0001-8479-8686; Nazarian-Samani, Masoud/0000-0001-9145-5032; Ramakrishna, Seeram/0000-0001-8479-8686; Nazarian-Samani, Mahboobeh/0000-0002-4788-0717; Kim, Kwang-Bum/0000-0002-2184-6617	National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2019R1A2C1088424]; Technology Innovation Program - Ministry of Trade, Industry Energy, Korea [10062226]; Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) [96007717]	National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Technology Innovation Program - Ministry of Trade, Industry Energy, Korea; Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF))	This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2019R1A2C1088424) and the Technology Innovation Program (No. 10062226, Development of flexible hybrid capacitor (0.25 mWh/cm2) composed of graphene-based flexible electrode and gel polymer electrolyte with high electrolyte uptake) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Korea.

Then, a flexible carbon/selenium composite electrode (Se@PCNFS) was obtained by melting and diffusion loading of selenium. The microstructure and morphology of the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the porous carbon nanofibers endowed the diameter of about 300 nm and selenium was uniformly dispersed within the fibers. Thus, Se@PCNFS electrode showed outstanding cycling performance and rate performance in lithium-selenium battery. 1Se@PCNFS electrode delivered the initial specific capacity of 569 mAh.g(-1) and maintained a reversible capacity of 340 mAh.g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C rate. The reversible capacity was 403 mAh.g(-1) at 2C rate.

The results of morphological observations show that there are abundant graphitic granular bulges with an average size of 40 nm and large numbers of micropores on the surface of amorphous carbon, which are similar to the surface microstructure of a lotus leaf. This unique surface microstructure endows the graphitic/amorphous carbon with a large surface area of 372 m(2) /g and a remarkable electrical conductivity of 14.3 S/cm. The graphitic/amorphous carbon is directly used as a freestanding and binderfree anode with a high surface mass of 2.6 mg/cm(2), which delivers high specific capacities of 335.9 mA h/g and 193 mA h/g at 100 mA/g for Li-ion batteries and Na-ion batteries, respectively. Moreover, the graphitic/amorphous carbon freestanding anode exhibits superior long-term cycling stability (1000 cycles) and excellent rate performance for both Li -ion -.on and Na-ion batteries.

Here, we demonstrate a promising lithiophilic-lithiophobic gradient interfacial layer strategy in which the bottom lithiophilic zinc oxide/carbon nanotube sublayer tightly anchors the whole layer onto the lithium foil, facilitating the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase, and prevents the formation of an intermediate mossy lithium corrosion layer. Together with the top lithiophobic carbon nanotube sublayer, this gradient interfacial layer can effectively suppress dendrite growth and ensure ultralong-term stable lithium stripping/plating. This strategy is further demonstrated to provide substantially improved cycle performance in copper current collector, 10 cm(2) pouch cell and lithium-sulfur batteries, which, coupled with a simple fabrication process and wide applicability in various materials for lithium-metal protection, makes the lithiophilic-lithiophobic gradient interfacial layer a favored strategy for next-generation lithium-metal batteries.

The effects of GPL content on the microstructure, phase composition and mechanical behaviors of reaction bonded silicon carbide ceramics were studied. Bulk density of the composites decreased with the increase of GPL contents because of the agglomeration of GPL. During reactive sintering, the GPL reacted with molten silicon to form laminated reinforcement, which brought about some toughening mechanisms including crack bridging, reinforcement pullout and reinforcement delamination. At the GPL content of 1.0 wt%, the flexural strength and fracture toughness of the composites reached the peak values of 436 MPa and 5.7 MPa m(1/2), respectively. Thus, this work provides a path to prepare high-performance silicon carbide ceramics by reactive sintering and graphene platelet. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the low-energy density and poor deformation performance are still a challenge. Herein, an amphiphilic polyurethane-based organo/hydrogel electrolyte (APUGE) with a H2O/AN-in-salt (H2O/AN-NaClO4) is prepared for the first time. The asprepared APUGE shows a wide voltage window (similar to 2.3 V), good adhesion, and excellent resilience. In addition, the intrinsically stretchable electrodes are prepared by coating the activated carbon slurry onto the PU/carbon black/MWCNT conductive elastic substrate. Based on the strong interface adhesion of the PU matrix, the as-assembled SSC delivers high-energy density (5.65 mW h cm(-3) when the power density is 0.0256 W cm(-3)) and excellent deformation stability with 94.5% capacitance retention after 500 stretching cycles at 100% strain. This fully integrated construction concept is expected to be extended to multisystem stretchable metal ion batteries, stretchable lithium-sulfur batteries, and other stretchable energy storage devices.

Rational Design of Low Cost and High Energy Lithium Batteries through Tailored Fluorine-free Electrolyte and Nanostructured S/C Composite	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						batteries; composite; electrolyte; lithium-ion; Li-S battery	SULFUR; CATHODE; PERFORMANCE; ANODE; LINO3	We report a new Li-S cell concept based on an optimized F-free catholyte solution and a high loading nanostructured C/S composite cathode. The Li2S8 present in the electrolyte ensures both buffering against active material dissolution and Li+ conduction. The high S loading is obtained by confining elemental S (approximate to 80%) in the pores of a highly ordered mesopores carbon (CMK3). With this concept we demonstrate stabilization of a high energy density and excellent cycling performance over 500 cycles. This Li-S cell has a specific capacity that reaches over 1000 mA hg(-1), with an overall S loading of 3.6 mg cm(-2) and low electrolyte volume (i.e., 10 mu L cm(-2)), resulting in a practical energy density of 365 Wh kg(-1). The Li-S system proposed thus meets the requirements for large scale energy storage systems and is expected to be environmentally friendly and have lower cost compared with the commercial Li-ion battery thanks to the removal of both Co and F from the overall formulation.

However, representative compounds such as sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) and polyaniline (SPANI) suffer from low sulfur contents and poor cycling performances under large current densities due to the sulfurization occurring only on polymers' surface. Her; a graphdiyne-like porous organic framework, denoted as GPOF, is synthesized and used as a host for enabling solid-phase sulfur conversion. Plenty of unsaturated bonds in GPOF provide sufficient reaction sites to bind sulfur chains, resulting in a high active sulfur content in the cathode. Moreover, the microporous GPOF possesses suitable cavities to accommodate the volume expansion, leading to favorable long-term cycling stability. As a result, the sulfurized GPOF cathode (SGPOF-320) displays outstanding electrochemical stability with negligible capacity decline after 250 cycles at 0.2 C with an average discharge capacity of 925 mA h g(-1). Our work applies a facile procedure to produce sulfur conversion porous polymer cathodes, which could provide a proper way for exploring more suitable cathode materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the reaction mechanism of the sulfur cathode is largely influenced by the electrolyte and the intermediate sulfur species during the first discharge process has not been quantitatively explored in different electrolytes. In this study, we elucidated the reaction mechanism of sulfide cathodes by using three different electrolyte systems, viz., a conventional liquid electrolyte [LiPF6/ethylene carbonate (EC)/ethylene-methyl carbonate (EMC)], a concentrated liquid electrolyte [lithium bis(trifluorosulfonyl)amide (LiTFSA)/tetraglyme (G4):1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (HFE)], and a solid-state electrolyte (Li3PS4). Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to examine the reaction mechanism of the sulfur cathode in the liquid and solid-state electrolytes during the first discharge process. In the conventional electrolyte, the sulfur cathode was reduced to long-chain polysulfide (S-6(2-)) during the first discharge process, and the polysulfide subsequently dissolved into the electrolyte. In the concentrated electrolyte, the sulfur cathode was reduced to midchain polysulfide (S-4(2-)) at the initial stage of the first discharge process and then reduced to short-chain polysulfide (S-2(2-)) and Li2S, followed by the formation of long-chain polysulfide (S-6(2-)). In the solid-state electrolyte, the sulfur cathode was reduced to long-chain polysulfide (S-6(2-)) at the initial stage of the first discharge process and was gradually reduced to mid-chain polysulfide (S-4(2-)), short-chain polysulfide (S-2(2-)), and Li2S. The differences in these reaction pathways govern electrochemical properties such as the difference in discharge voltage.

However, the major issues such as self-discharge, low sulfur utilization in cathode and magnesium anode passivation severely hamper the battery operation. In this study, spontaneous magnesium polysulfide formation is observed in the Mg[B(hfip)(4)](2), Mg(TFSI)(2)-MgCl2 electrolytes, which leads to severe self-discharge of Mg-S cells. Interestingly, unlike in lithium-sulfur battery, these magnesium polysulfides forms as crystalline magnesium polysulfide on the magnesium foil, which could escalate the self-discharge of the cells. The incorporation of graphene-polyaniline coated carbon cloth (GPN-PANI@CC) as a protective interlayer which effectively adsorbs the polysulfide and inhibit the self-discharge of Mg-S cells in the non-corrosive Mg[B(hfip)(4)](2) electrolyte. This interlayer not only improve the polysulfide retention in cathode but also the capacity values in Mg[B(hfip)(4)](2) electrolyte compared to Mg(TFSI)(2)-MgCl2 electrolyte. The cells with interlayer show the initial capacity of 1121 mA h g(-1) and maintained a capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) after 150 cycles with coulombic efficiency of >99%. This cell design strategy provides a promising approach for improving metal-sulfur batteries.

Here, we explored the dual-network graphene/epoxy composites with enhanced tribological and thermal management. The 3D graphene was prepared using calcium ions as the crosslinker and melamine foam as template. Subsequently, the reinforced concrete-like composites were obtained by dipping in silica-filled epoxy. The research results show that the thermal conductivity of the composites was enhanced by 1015.52% compared to the silica-filled epoxy. Simultaneously, the friction coefficient of the composites was reduced to 0.29 with the wear rate be reduced to 0.19 x 10(-5) mm(3)/N.m under the condition of 5 N and 2 cm/s. This dual-network model provides a new strategy for the development of solid lubricating materials with excellent thermal management.

However, the widespread use of LSBs is still impeded by the low conductivity of sulfur, the volume expansion of active materials, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in practical conditions. In this work, a novel sulfur matrix integrating self-branched Nb2O5 nanoarrays and flexible carbon cloth (NBCC) is designed and prepared. The conformal S@NBCC composite provides surface-to-surface contact between sulfur and the catalytic mediator, thus exposing more active sites for trapping LiPSs. Meanwhile, the selected Nb2O5 nanoarrays with ultrafast Li+ motion capability can work as "electron-ion reservoirs" to further accelerate the conversion reaction of LiPSs. Moreover, the extra-free space among the branched nanoarrays can not only facilitate the infiltration of the liquid electrolyte, but also enhance its tolerance to volume expansion of sulfur during the lithiation process. Benefitting from these synergistic effects, the self-supported S@NBCC shows a high specific capacity of 1262.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintains an impressive specific capacity of 759.6 mA h g(-1) even after 300 cycles at 1 C, showing great potential in promoting the practical application of flexible LSBs.

J	Agostini, M; Scrosati, B; Hassoun, J				Agostini, Marco; Scrosati, Bruno; Hassoun, Jusef			An Advanced Lithium-Ion Sulfur Battery for High Energy Storage	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; ELECTROLYTE; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; PROGRESS; POLYMER; CHALLENGES; SALT	A lithium-ion battery is reported using a sulfur-carbon composite cathode, a graphite anode, and a dimethoxyethane-dioxolane-lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (DOL-DME-LiTFSI) electrolyte advantageously added by lithium nitrate (LiNO3) and a selected polysulfi de (Li2S8). The suppressed sulfur dissolution, due to the Li2S8 buffer action, as well as reduced shuttle reactions by the film-forming properties of the LiNO3 positively affect the lithium-ion cell behavior in terms of delivered capacity, coulombic efficiency, and cycle life. The lithium-sulfur cell shows a stable capacity of 750 mAh g(-1) for over 200 cycles with an enhanced cycling efficiency. Furthermore, the full lithium-ion sulfur battery using a graphite-based anode shows a working voltage of about 2 V and delivers a stable capacity of 500 mAh g(-1). The full cell has enhanced safety content, due to the replacement of the lithium metal anode by suitable intercalation electrode, and shows a theoretical energy density as high as 1000 Wh kg(-1) at high current rate of 1 C. The remarkable safety level, low materials cost, and high practical energy density, expected to exceed 300 Wh kg(-1), suggest the battery reported is a suitable energy storage system for future applications.

The introduced phenolic resol resin and its pyrolysis derivative effectively combine the sheets together and thus the three-dimensional networks of the enhanced aerogels are well retained even after compounding with epoxy resin. The synthesized aerogels are highly efficient in endowing epoxy with high electrical conductivity, excellent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency and satisfactory mechanical reinforcement. With only 033 wt% of the annealed aerogel, its epoxy nanocomposite exhibits a high electrical conductivity of 73 S/m and an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness of 35 dB, which are among the best results for polymer nano composites with even higher loadings. Especially, the EMI shielding performance is comparable to or even higher than that of the nanocomposite filled with chemical vapor deposition-synthesized graphene foam. Furthermore, the aerogel also leads to notable 67% and 20.2% increases in flexural strength and flexural modulus, respectively. Therefore, the phenolic resin-enhanced graphene aerogel holds a great potential in producing high-performance polymer nanocomposites for EMI shielding application. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Graphene was pretreated by thermal reflux using 20-60 % nitric acid. The pretreated graphene and catalysts were characterized with TPR, TEM, SEM, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy to study the effect of treatment on microstructures of the materials. This work showed that cobalt metal uniformly dispersed on graphene, and with increasing pretreating acid concentration, surface defects increased and the cobalt particle size decreased, suggesting alleviated agglomeration of cobalt particles on graphene. Pretreating improved the reduction of the catalyst due to the increased defect sites, improved supportmetal interaction and cobalt dispersion. Pretreated catalyst yielded better activity, higher C5+, but lower methane selectivity than unpretreated catalyst. Therefore, acid pretreatment of graphene can be an effective approach to modify the microstructure of the material, and can thus enhance the performance of the prepared catalyst.

Herein we firstly synthesize the lignin-melamine resins by grafting melamine onto lignin. Afterwards, nitrogen doped hard carbon is prepared by the pyrolysis of lignin-melamine resins with the aid of catalyst (Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O) at 1000 degrees C. Compared with the samples without nitrogen-doping and catalysis, as-prepared nitrogen doped hard carbon exhibits higher reversible capacity (345 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), higher rate capability (145 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)) and excellent cycling stability. The superior electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of nitrogen doping, graphitic structure and amorphous structure. Among them, nitrogen doping could create the vacancies around the nitrogen sites, which enhance the reactivity and the electronic conductivity of materials. Additionally, graphitic structure also enhances the electronic conductivity of materials, thus improving the electrochemical performance of hard carbon. It is worthwhile that lignin, renewable and abundant biopolymer, is converted to hard carbon with good electrochemical performance, which realizes the high value utilization of lignin.

However, how to improve the phonon transport ability at the interface between the graphene basal plane and the matrix is still unclear. In this study, three-dimensional graphene networks (3DGNs) with varying defect densities are fabricated by adjusting the chemical vapor deposition processes, and these specimens are adopted as fillers to modify various resins with different functional groups to reveal the interface contact rule. By optimizing the defect density of the 3DGNs, a synergy between the thermal boundary resistances of the filler and matrix and the high intrinsic thermal conductivity of the filler can be achieved in the resulting TIMs, and the epoxy group from the matrix is found to be the best active group to form a close contact between the defects of the 3DGNs. After that, the thermal performance stability of the resulting TIMs under a high temperature for a long time is detected, and the influence from increased Umklapp scattering is partially offset by the weakened Kapitza scattering. Moreover, the corresponding mechanical properties have been measured to confirm the feasibility of the resulting TIMs for practical application areas.

To meet the demand of heat-managing in a dynamic environment, responsive textiles with tunable thermal convection and radiation have been developed, while the design of fabrics with tunable thermal conduction remains unexplored. Here, a humidity-driven and flexible thermal conductance regulating material is developed that shows an unprecedented switching ratio up to 14x, which is composed of brick-and-mortar structured graphene and silk sericin (GS). This work investigates the microstructure variation in response to humidity experimentally and theoretically. The regulation can be ascribed to the hydration/dehydration of sericin and the subsequent changing in graphene-sericin interfacial thermal conductance. It is demonstrated that the GS can be facilely coated on ordinary textiles through dyeing to achieve responsive thermal-managing clothes with a significant and reversible response toward the variation of environment humidity.

It was discovered that onion-like hollow QG, which consists of multi-layer graphene and different carbon allotropes having a high proportion of folded edges and surface defects, could endow the scaffolded COFs with enhanced green fluorescence and environmental stability. Unexpectedly, they could exhibit the powerful absorption for Cu2+ ions resulting in the specific quenching of fluorescence. A fluorimetric strategy with QG-scaffolded COFs was thereby developed to probe Cu2+ ions separately in blood and wastewater with the linear concentration ranges of 0.0010 -10.0 mu M (limit of detection of 0.50 nM) and 0.0032-32.0 mu M (limit of detection of 2.4 nM), respectively, promising the potential applications for the field-applicable monitoring of Cu2+ ions in the clinical and environmental analysis fields. In addition, the prepared COFs sorbents were employed to absorb Cu2+ ions in wastewater showing high removal efficiency. More importantly, such an one-pot fabrication route with hollow QG scaffolds may be tailorable extensively for the preparation of a variety of metal-free multifunctional COFs with enhanced fluorescence, water solubility, environmental stability, and metal removal capability.

Properties of the NT arrays before heat-treatment are evaluated with those after heat-treatment for applicability as a reservoir and conductor of sulfur electrode. A reasonably high amount of sulfur is loaded (14.8%) from 30% feed sulfur solution at 160 degrees C in the candidate NT array chosen as the sulfur reservoir. Three electrodes from the only NT array, the sulfur-loaded NT array with and without coating layer are evaluated on electrochemical performances. The sulfur electrode with coating layer, consisting of super-P and PVdF, exhibits the highest initial and retention capacity in discharge, respectively, of 1547 mAh g(-1) and 1085 mAh g(-1) up to 100 cycles. Rate capability at various C-rates from 0.1 to 30 C is also found to be exceptionally good. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Se/nitrogen-doped porous carbon composite is applied as the cathode for rechargeable K-Se batteries for the first time. The abundant and hierarchical porous structure is advantageous in overcoming the volume expansion problem caused by polyselenides during discharge-charge process. The in-situ nitrogen-doped porous carbon enhances electronic conductivity of the cathode composite material. The electrochemical result shows that the as-obtained Se/nitrogen-doped porous carbon composite with Se content of 53% delivers good rate capacity with coulombic efficiency of nearly similar to 90% and a reversible cycling capacity of 327 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, maintaining about 130 mA h g(-1) even after 100 cycles.

Graphdiyne (GDY) is a new member of carbon-based 2D NMs possessing sp- and sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms. However, the toxicity of GDY is less investigated as GO. In this study, we compared the toxicity of GDY and GO with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Exposure to up to 100-mu g/ml GDY and GO induced cytotoxicity, but there was no statistically significant difference between GDY and GO. At noncytotoxic concentration, 25-mu g/ml GDY or GO led to the internalization of NMs, typically in cytoplasm but not in nuclei. Only GO but not GDY significantly increased THP-1 adhesion onto NM-exposed HUVECs. Meanwhile, compared with GDY, GO more effectively promoted the release of soluble intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), indicating the differential effects of GDY and GO on endothelial activation. Neither GDY nor GO induced intracellular superoxide. However, GO significantly promoted the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and X-box binding protein 1 spliced (XBP-1s), as well pyroptosis genes NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and gasdermin D (GSDMD), whereas GDY did not show this effect. The results suggested that GDY and GO could be internalized into HUVECs leading to cytotoxic effects. However, GO was more potent to activate endothelial activation probably due to the activation of ER stress and pyroptosis genes.

In this study, graphene (GR) is chosen as an interfacial material to develop a MG/GR multilayer with enhanced mechanical and tribological properties. We report on the fabrication of this multilayer by repeated deposition of Cu50Zr50 MG alternating with transfer of GR. Upon deformation, it is found that the incorporation of GR can lead to extensive shear bands and shear band/interface interactions, which are confirmed by the transition of deformation mode from a chaotic to a self-organized critical state. In comparison with the monolithic MG film, the coefficient of friction and wear rate of the multilayer are decreased by ~ 35% and 65% respectively, which is attributed to the enhanced mechanical properties and lubricating effect induced by the GR layer. The current work not only broadens our understanding of the positive role of GR in improving the frictional behavior of MG, but opens a new path for designing of novel MG films with a combination of exceptional mechanical and tribological properties.

However, the electrocatalyst active sites and the underlying mechanisms occurring in zinc-air batteries remain confusing due to the lack of in situ analytical techniques. In this work, the in situ observations, including X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, of a heteroatom-doped carbon air cathode are reported, in which the chemisorption of oxygen molecules and oxygen-containing intermediates on the carbon material can be facilitated by the electron deficiency caused by heteroatom doping, thus improving the oxygen reaction activity for zinc-air batteries. As expected, solid-state zinc-air batteries equipped with such air cathodes exhibit superior reversibility and durability. This work thus provides a profound understanding of the reaction principles of heteroatom-doped carbon materials in zinc-air batteries.

In order to solve these problems, the nanocomposite photocatalysts consisted of graphene nanosheets (GR) and N-doped TiO2 nanoplates (NTNP) with exposed {001} facets were synthesized by a sol-gel process for the first time. The physical and chemical properties of the resultant nanocomposites (NTNP/GR) were studied in detail, and their photocatalytic activities were investigated by the photocatalytic decoloration of methylene blue solution under visible-light irradiation (lambda>420 nm). Owing to smaller particle size (about 25 nm) and higher specific surface area in comparison with micrometer-sized NTP, the photocatalytic activity of NTNP was improved effectively. Due to the effective charge anti-recombination of graphene, the photocatalytic activity of nanocomposite NTNP/GR was further improved. Due to the competition for light absorption between graphene and NTNP, there was an optimal ratio (1.0 %, the weight percentage of graphene to TiO2) between graphene and NTNP for the maximum of visible-light photocatalytic activity.

The self-assembly of the PDA coated graphene nanosheets was conducted at different reaction concentrations and times, and monitored by atomic force microscopy images. The results indicated that the thickness of the PDA coatings could be conveniently controlled in a range from nearly a single PDA monolayer to tens of nanometers. Meanwhile, thermogravimetric curves, AFM phase images and alkali treatment study suggested that the PDA clusters were formed by crosslinked conjugates. Field emission scanning electron microscope results indicated that the PDA clusters exhibited surface dependent aggregation and roughness. The typical procedure for the synthesis of PDA coated reduced graphene oxide (RGO) can be divided into three steps: (1) dopamine converts GO into RGO; (2) the pH induced spontaneously polymerization of DA and deposition of PDA precursors on the RGO surface; (3) the further growth of PDA precursors and the self-assembly into large PDA clusters. Furthermore, the PDA layer assembled graphene sheets could function as versatile templates to construct 2D architectures with mineralized inorganic/metal nanoparticles; and the regarding catalytic ability and the adsorption of heavy metal ions were studied. Moreover, the DA can function as reductant for low temperature assembly of porous 3D hydrogel via pi-pi interactions and PDA polymerization. The PDA assembled graphene areogel can be used as a promising adsorbent for the removal of oils, organic solvents and dyes from contaminated water. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ni@Graphene core-shell nanostructures were obtained following a self-catalyzed growth mechanism. The kinetic epitaxial growth of RGO layers on Ni(111) facets originates from annealing-driving phase transition from NiO to Ni at temperature >= 450 degrees C, which was revealed by utilizing comprehensive characterizations including X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. This distinct core-shell structure shows extraordinary catalytic activity in reduction of 4-nitrophenol with the efficiency reaching up to 45.0 L g(-1) min(-1) at room temperature. Atom-resolved microscopy evidences disclose that such outstanding catalytic activity could be attributed to the synergetic cooperation between Ni phase and epitaxial graphene shell. This work provides general inspiration on the facile fabrication of highly active and non-noble metal-graphene catalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A porous carbon with a uniform distribution of mesopores of 7.3 nm has been synthesized through a soft-template synthesis method. The potassium hydroxide activation of this mesoporous carbon results in a bimodal porous carbon with added microporosity of less than 2 nm to the existing mesopores without deterioration of the integrity of the original mesoporous carbon. Elemental sulfur has been loaded to the micropores through a solution infiltration method. The resulted S/C composites with various loading level or sulfur have a high surface areas and large internal porosities. These materials have been tested as novel cathodes for Li/S batteries. The results show that the cyclability and the utilization of sulfur in the Li/S batteries have been significantly improved. The large internal porosity and Surface area of the micromesoporous carbon is essential for the high utilization of sulfur.

Functionalized MWNTs were well dispersed in the PVA solution and the carbon fiber was dip-coated in this solution. After heat treatment of the coated carbon fiber under a nitrogen atmosphere, MWNTs with carboxyl groups were grafted onto the functionalized carbon fiber via chemical interaction. The resulting materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Raman spectrum and mechanical testing. FESEM observations revealed uniform coverage of carbon nanotubes on carbon fiber. The carbon fiber grafted with MWNTs improved the tensile strength by 12% with respect to the pristine carbon fiber. These results are supportive of good interfacial bonding between the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon fiber. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

In this work, we focus on developing high-performance cathode material for biocompatible zinc/polymer batteries utilizing biofluids as electrolyte. Conductive polymers and graphene are generally considered to be biocompatible and suitable for bioengineering applications. To harness the high electrical conductivity of graphene and the redox capability of polypyrrole (PPy), a polypyrrole fiber/graphene composite has been synthesized via a simple one-step route. This composite is highly conductive (141 S cm(-1)) and has a large specific surface area (561 m(2) g(-1)). It performs more effectively as the cathode material than pure polypyrrole fibers. The battery constructed with PPy fiber/reduced graphene oxide cathode and Zn anode delivered an energy density of 264 mWh g(-1) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffer saline.

The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations proved the tight adherence of graphene sheets to the surface of porous Co3O4 slices. Gas sensors based on the as-synthesized products were then fabricated to explore their potential applications. The results indicated that the optimal hybrid exhibited a response of 26.8% to 5 ppm of NO2 at room temperature (RT), which was 2.27 times higher than that of undoped Co3O4 (100 degrees C). The hybrid sensor also showed fast response, excellent selectivity, long-term stability and extremely low detection limit toward NO2 at RT. The significantly enhanced sensing properties to NO2 could be attributed to larger specific surface area, more chemisorbed oxygen species and the coupling effect between Co3O4 and graphene in the hybrid. As we all know, as a typical p-type semiconductor, the gas-sensing properties of Co3O4 toward oxidizing gases including NO2 was rarely reported. We believe that our work could pave the way for the future design of Co3O4-based gas sensors for oxidizing gases detection at low or even room temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Comparing to non-cross-linked carbon nanofiber (NCLCNF) obtained via carbonizing of pre-oxidation PAN nanofiber, CLCNF shows better conductivity owing to its crosslinked structure. Then CLCNF was used as scaffold to support polyaniline (PANi) nanorods for supercapacitor electrode material. The hierarchical CLCNF/PANi composite displays a capacity of 206C g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) with excellent rate capability (remains 49% even at 800 A g(-1)), which is much higher than that of NCLCNF/PANi composite (17%). More interestingly, supercapacitor device based on CLCNF/PANi composite achieves 75.3% capacity retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 A g(-1), suggesting excellent cycle stability.

CNT based biosensors can play an important role in amperometric, immunosensor and nucleic-acid sensing devices, e.g. for detection of life threatening biological agents in time of war or in terrorist attacks, saving life and money for the NHS. CNTs offer unique advantages in several areas, like high surface-volume ratio, high electrical conductivity, chemical stability and strong mechanical strength, and CNT based sensors generally have higher sensitivities and lower detection limit than conventional ones. In this review, recent advances in biosensors utilising carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube fibres will be discussed. The synthesis methods, nanostructure approaches and current developments in biosensors using CNTs will be introduced in the first part. In the second part, the synthesis methods and up-to-date progress in CNT fibre biosensors will be reviewed. Finally, we briefly outline some exciting applications for CNT and CNT fibres which are being targeted. By harnessing the continual advancements in micro and nano-technology, the functionality and capability of CNT-based biosensors will be enhanced, thus expanding and enriching the possible applications that can be delivered by these devices.

In order to address these issues, in this work, a simple and up-scalable wet-mechanochemical (wet-ball milling) route has been developed for fabrication of amorphous porous TiO2@nitrogen doped graphene (TiO2@N-G) nanocomposites. The amorphous phase, unique porous structure of TiO2 and the surface defects from nitrogen doping to graphene planes have incurred surface controlled reactions, contributing pseudocapacitance to the total capacity of the battery. It plays a dominant role in producing outstanding high rate electrochemical performance, e.g., 182.7 mAh/g (at 3.36 A/g) after 100 cycles. The design and synthesis of electrode materials with enhanced conductivity and surface pseudocapacitance can be a promising way for high rate LIBs. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, ternary TiO2/polyaniline /graphene composite was successfully prepared through a facile route. The morphologies, crystal phases, optical and electrochemical properties of the prepared photocatalysts were systematically investigated by XRD, SEM, TEM, FT-IR, PL, photocurrent response techniques. The resultant TiO2/polyaniline/graphene sample exhibited superior photodegradation performance towards organic dyes elimination (such as Rhodamine B, Methylene Blue, and Methyl Orange) under visible light irradiation, which was higher than that of pristine TiO2. Moreover, a cycling experiment revealed that as-prepared composite catalyst showed enhanced durability. Based on the above results and discussion, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism of ternary TiO2/polyaniline/graphene hybrid was proposed. Therefore, this work supplies a facile route to design highly efficient and stable photocatalysis for water purification.

Physical characterizations demonstrate that FG exhibits outstanding mechanical strength, adhesion and ductility compared with traditional binder polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Especially, FG possesses strong adsorption capability to trap the polysulfieds, as verified by immersion tests and density functional theory calculations. With these features, FG as binder provides the sulfur cathode with remarkable cycling stability, which presents a capacity retention of 91.6% with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.7% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C, compared to the 62.9% and 95.4% of the sulfur cathode using PVDF as binder. Impressively, FG outperforms other natural polymers that have been reported as the binders of sulfur cathodes.

J	Jung, Y; Kang, B				Jung, Yongjo; Kang, Byoungwoo			Understanding abnormal potential behaviors at the 1st charge in Li2S cathode material for rechargeable Li-S batteries	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; ION BATTERIES; COMPOSITE; ENERGY	In this study, electrochemical behaviors of Li2S such as a large potential barrier at the beginning of the 1st charging process and a continuous increase in potential to similar to 4 V during the rest of this process were understood through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and electrochemical evaluations for a full utilization of Li2S. The large potential barrier to the 1st charge in Li2S can be caused by the presence of insulating oxidized products (Li2SO3 or Li2SO4-like structures) on the surface; simple surface etching can remove them and thereby reduce the potential barrier. Even though the potential barrier was substantially reduced, the electrochemical activity of Li2S might not be improved due to the continuous increase in potential. This increase in potential was related to the polarization caused by the Li2S-conversion reaction; the polarization can affect the utilization of Li2S in subsequent cycles. We speculate that the increase in potential is related to the decomposition of oxidized products such as Li2CO3-like or Li2O-like structures on the surface of the Li2S particles. These findings indicate that the full utilization of Li2S can be achieved by controlling their surface characteristics, especially the surface oxidation products.

However, this technology suffers from several problems mainly related to the instability of metallic lithium and to the polysulfides (PS) shuttle. An approach to address such issues is the design of new separators or the modification of existing commercial ones. The use of hybrid membranes is here proposed to improve the performance of Li metal anode and sulfur cathode. Composite separators are obtained by electrospinning or drop-casting a polymer solution of polyvinylidenefluoride (PVdF) containing graphene oxide (GO) on a polyolefin commercial Celgard 2300 separator. This is the first time that a thin layer of electrospun PVdF/GO composite is applied to a polyolefin separator for the use in Li metal-based batteries. We demonstrate that electrospinning is an effective method to obtain a thin polymer layer of PVdF/GO. The electrospun layer improves the wettability of the separator; it is beneficial to the growth of "soft" dendrite on Li anode and has a positive effect on the PS shuttle process. The casted layer featuring a higher GO content is also effective in increasing the separator wettability, although with a minor effect on Li interphase.

Herein, mesoporous Ti3C2 MXene (MTC) is successfully prepared and designed as sulfur host materials in Li-S batteries. Benefiting from the high electrical conductivity, mesoporous structure, and strong interaction with polysulfide, MTC could accelerate the redox reaction kinetics of polysulfide. Therefore, the as-prepared MTC host could act as an efficient polysulfide immobilizer to inhibit the shuttle effect. At the same time, the MTC also could serve as a catalyst to promote polysulfide conversion. As a result, the as-prepared MTC/S composites maintain the high capacity of 689 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles, demonstrating excellent cycling stability. This work provides promising cathode materials for future practical applications of Li-S batteries.

The optimal material was synthesized with 0.5 wt% of graphene loading (G/A/TNS-0.5), which could efficiently degrade 96.1% of SMT at 4 h. G/A/TNS-0.5 showed enhanced photocatalytic activity compared with the neat anatase and unmodified anatase/titanate nanosheets (A/TNS). UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra indicated that G/A/TNS-0.5 had a lower energy band gap (E-g) of 2.8 eV than A/TNS (3.1 eV). The grafted graphene acted as an electron transfer mediator after photoexcitation, resulting in inhibition on rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs. More importantly, architecture of graphene and titanate nanosheets both with two-dimensional structures greatly facilitated the photoexcited electron transfer. center dot OH and O-1(2) were the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) to SMT degradation. Fukui index (f(-)) derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculation predicted the active sites on SMT molecule, and then SMT degradation pathway was proposed by means of intermediates identification and theoretical calculation. Furthermore, G/A/TNS-0.5 could be well reused and 90.5% of SMT was also degraded after five runs. The developed new photocatalysts show great potential for degradation of emerging organic contaminants through photocatalysis under solar light. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unraveling the effects of anions in Ni(x)A(y)@CC (A=O, S, P) on Li-sulfur batteries	MATERIALS TODAY NANO			English	Article						Li-S batteries; Nickel compounds; Superior cycling stability; DFT	LITHIUM; CATHODE; NANOCRYSTALS; CONVERSION; EFFICIENT; HOST	Nickel-based compounds have been regarded as potential sulfur carriers in Li-sulfur (Li-S) battery. However, the relationship between the anions in those compounds, which are crucial to the intrinsic properties, and their electrochemical performances remains unclear. Herein, nickel compounds with the same morphologies, i.e., Ni5P4, NiO, and NiS, grown on carbon cloths (noted as Ni(x)A(y)@CC (A = O, S, P)) have been rationally designed to act as sulfur hosts in Li-S batteries to investigate the compositional effects on their catalytic activities and chemical absorption abilities. Density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that such variations in electrochemical performance are attributed to the interaction between polysulfides (PSs) and nickel compounds, leading to different adsorption energies and interfacial states. Among them, Ni5P4@CC exhibits the best electrochemical performance, delivering capacities of 1349.5, 1020.4, 803.7, 656.7 mAh g(-1) at rates of 0.1, 0.5, 2, and 3C, respectively. Moreover, super stable cycling performance has been achieved at 1C and 3C by Ni5P4@CC-based electrode, showing an ultralow decay ratio of 0.0357% and 0.0173% per cycle for over 1000 and 2000 cycles, respectively. In contrast, NiS@CC and NiO@CC show 0.0796% and 0.0787% per cycle at the cycling test. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Learning from the gold extraction method utilizing the lime-sulfur synthetic-solution, a CuS@S hybrid utilizing CaSx as both sulfur resource and reductant-oxidant is prepared, which is an efficient approach to apply the metallurgy for the preparation of electrode materials. Regulating the amount of CuCl2, the CuS@S is induced to reach a molecular-level hybrid. When utilized as an anode within a lithium-ion battery, it presents the specific capacity of 514.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) over 200 cycles. Supported by the analyses of pseudo capacitive behaviors, it is confirmed that the CuS matrix with the suitable content of auxiliary sulfur could improve the durability of the CuS-based anode. Expanding the wider application within lithium-sulfur batteries, the synchronous growth of CuS@S exhibits stronger chemisorption with polysulfides than the mechanical mixture of CuS and S. A suite of in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies further investigates the stable resistances of the CuS@S within the charge/discharge process, corresponding to the reversible structure evolution. This systematic work may provide a practical fabricating route of metal sulfides for scalable energy storage applications.

As-prepared activated carbons were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N-2 sorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). XRD and FTIR results confirmed that CaCO3 which is naturally present in azolla biomass is responsible for crystallinity of the final materials and in collaboration with NaOH as activation agent led to high surface area nanoporous carbons. Activation process increased the specific surface area of the initial char from about 3 m(2) g(-1) to 2680 m(2) g(-1). Large ordered atomic layers domains of carbon were observed in HR-TEM. CO2 adsorption capacity was investigated for the azolla-derived carbons which proved the high room temperature capture ability of near 7.18 mmol g(-1) at 1 bar and 12.5 mmol g(-1) at 20 bar. More significantly, extraordinary capacity of methylene blue uptake by about 4448 mg g(-1) has been observed in azolla-derived porous carbon which is the highest ever reported for water cleaning.

The strategies toward fully demonstrating the potential of nanocarbon as three-dimensional (3D) conductive scaffolds for cathodes are highly required to broaden the application of nanocarbon in energy storage. Herein, hierarchical carbon nanotube/carbon black (CNT/CB) scaffolds were employed to promote the possible shortand long-range electron pathways in different scales within the LiFePO4 cathode. With the construction of hierarchical CNT/CB conductive scaffolds, the LiFePO4/C cathode exhibits enhanced Li storage performance and improved electrochemical kinetics. At a current density of 0.2 C, LiFePO4/C cathode with such hierarchical CNT/CB networks exhibited reversible discharge capacity of 156.9 mAh g(-1) over 50 cycles. When the current density was increased to 1.2 C, a capacity of 119.1 mAh g(-1) was still preserved, and a capacity of 150.5 inAh CI at 0.2 C rate was available after 1.2 C rate, indicating a high reversibility of the composite cathode. This strategy to hybridize CNTs and CBs into hierarchical scaffolds not only demonstrated its high efficiency to build LiFePO4/C composite cathodes with excellent Li storage performance and good economy but also could be applied to supercapacitors, redox flow batteries, and Li/S and Li/O-2 batteries with improved energy storage performance.

First, a suspension solution that contained PdO and graphene was pyrolyzed under certain conditions, and then the products were anchored on a glassy carbon (GC) electrode, leading to the formation of pyrolysis-treated PdO/G coated GC electrode. Lastly, the resultant electrodes were potentially scanned using cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique for 50 cycles at various scanning rates in a potential range, yielding four kinds of CV-treated PdO/G electrodes. In this work, the electrodes obtained at the scan rate of 5, 10, 50, 90 mV s(-1) were, respectively, denoted as catalyst a, b, c and d. The morphologies of the samples were mainly characterized via scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrocatalytic activities of the as-prepared catalysts for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) were principally studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). The electrochemical results strongly indicated that the catalyst of PdO/G treated by 10 mV s(-1) exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance among all the prepared catalysts. The relatively smaller particle size and higher content of Pd were thought as the major reasons for the excellent electrocatalytic activity of catalyst b towards EOR when compared to other catalysts.

ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS			English	Article						Dendrite-free; Li metal batteries; Hollow carbon sponge; Separator		The high theoretical specific capacity and low redox potential endow lithium (Li) great promise to be used in the next generation rechargeable batteries. However, the safety issues and cycling degradation that are caused by dendrite growth and high reactivity of Li, impede the practical application of Li metal batteries. Herein, a strategy is reported to confine electrolyte in a nitrogen- and carboxyl-rich hollow carbon sponge reservoir. The hollow structure and its lithiophilicity help to mitigate the side reactions by containing the electrolyte. The carboxyl groups in the carbon sponge that can form hydrogen bond with 1,2-dimethoxyethane and thus alleviate the Li solvation and enhance the Li mobility, along with the lithiophilicity that controls Li distribution, substantially suppress dendrite growth. The limited Li solvation also reduces the parasitic reactions of solvent molecules on Li anode. With such carbon sponge electrolyte reservoir, the Li-Li cells can operate stably for over 4000 hours and Li-Cu cells exhibit Coulombic efficiency of similar to 99.3% after at least 800 cycles. The practical application of such reservoir is also demonstrated in Li-LiCoO2 and Li-S batteries.

It has been recently shown that it can be simply and scalably co-polymerised, by "inverse vulcanisation" with organic crosslinkers. The properties of porous carbons, which have extensive uses in science and industry, are influenced by the materials from which they are generated. Reported here are the first examples of porous carbons produced from high-sulfur inverse vulcanised polymers. The materials produced show micro-porosity, gas selectivity, and are doped with sulfur. The simplicity of the technique, and wide range of other potential inverse vulcanised feedstocks, gives scope for transferability and control of properties.

However, it remains great challenge to prepare such kind of new two-dimensional (2D) polymer nanosheets without using any templates. In this work, thiadiazole-containing expanded heteroazaporphyrinoid was designed as the building blocks for preparation of free-standing N/S-containing polymer nanosheets (PN) without using any templates. Most importantly, such PN can coordinate with transition metal ions to prepare Fe, N, and S containing PN-Fe. By using these PN-Fe as precursors, Fe/N/S co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (PCN-FeNS) can be facilely prepared by direct pyrolysis under inert condition. The N and S contents of PCN-FeNS can reach up to 6.4 at.% and 0.8 at.%, respectively. For proof-of-concept, PCN-FeNS were further used as electrochemical catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and neutral media. Benefiting from the high surface area and rich-doping character, PCN-FeNS exhibited relatively high half-wave potential of down to 0.71 V, via a four-electron transfer mechanism (n = 3.87 at 0.65 V), as well as high diffusion limiting current density (J(L) = 5.02 mA cm(-2)), which are comparable to commercial precious metal based electrocatalysts. This study not only offers a new method to prepare conjugated polymer nanosheets, but also provides a new strategy to fabricate Fe/N/S co-doped porous carbon nanosheets for versatile energy-related applications.

The electrochemical tests demonstrated that the SPS-treated Li2S-C composites showed the initial charge and discharge capacities of ca. 1200 and 200 mAh g(-1), respectively, though Li2S has been reported to show no significant charge capacities when conventionally mixed with carbon powder. Such activation of Li2S was attributed principally to strong bindings between Li2S and carbon powders, formed by the SPS treatment. The ex situ XRD measurements showed that some amounts of Li2S were still remained unchanged and any elemental sulfur was not detected even at fully charged state, which was similar to Li/S cells.

However, lithium metal anodes undergo Li dendrite formation during the cycling process, which may cause safety hazards. To address this issue, we herein report a novel electron regulation strategy via a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) wrapped tubular carbon array (TCA) for design of stable lithium metal anodes. The pre-formed SEI layer at the outer surface of the TCA creates higher impedance than the inner surface; this results in selective electron transport along the tubular carbon to/from the current collector, rather than through the SEI layer, so that lithiation occurs inside the ordered tubular carbon, thus minimizing or preventing dendrite growth. With this strategy, a Li metal anode with high coulombic efficiency (98% during 200 cycles) and stable cycling performance (>150 h at 1 mA cm(-2) with 2 mA h cm(-2)) is obtained. With this anode, a lithium-sulfur battery exhibits high coulombic efficiency (similar to 98%) and good cycling stability (942 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C after 100 cycles). Our work provides a simple but effective strategy to design stable Li metal anodes.

This pre-lithiation process is taken place simply by dropping the organolithium reagent lithium naphthalenide (Li(+)Naph(-)) on the prepared sulfur cathode. It is the first time realizing the room temperature chemical pre-lithaition reaction attributed by the 3D nanostructured carbon nanotube (CNT) current collector. It is confirmed that the Li2S cathode fabricated at room temperature showing higher capacity and lower hysteresis than the Li2S cathode fabricated at high temperature pre-lithiation. The prelithiated Li2S cathode at room temperature shows stable cycling performance with a 600 mAh g(-1), capacity after 100 cycles at 0.1 C-rate and high capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) at 2 C-rate. This simple on -site prelithiation method at room temperature is demonstrated to be applicable for the in-situ pre-lithiation in a Li metal free battery. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Then the Pd/rGO/NF and CoOx/rGO/NF electrodes were synthesized by conventional methods of electrodeposition and hydrothermal synthesis. The structure, morphology and composition of the composite substrate and two electrodes were characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and Raman analysis. The performance of the two electrodes for H2O2 electroreduction and Al-H2O2 fuel cells were both investigated. The morphology of rGO/NF composite can be adjusted by changing the concentration and pH of GO suspensions. A compact, uniform and pleated rGO coating on the Ni foam surface was obtained at the GO concentration of 2 g L-1 and pH = 7. Metallic Pd nanoparticles with a size of 7-8 nm and hybrid CoO/Co3O4 composite nanosheets were decorated on the rGO/NF composite substrates. The Pd/rGO/NF and CoOx/rGO/NF electrodes showed higher catalytic activity for H2O2 reduction than the Pd/NF and CoOx/NF electrodes. Al-H2O2 semi-fuel cells with the two electrodes as cathodes presented a maximum power density of 267 mW cm(-2) and 240 mW cm(-2) in the catholyte of 0.5 mol L-1 H2O2 + 3.0 mol L-1 NaOH at 50 degrees C, respectively.

In this paper, Fe3C nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes/porous carbon (Fe3C@N-CNPC) 3D materials were synthesized by pyrolysis of N-doped distilled grains in the presence of FeCl3/ZnCl2 activators. It was demonstrated that the FeCl3/ZnCl2 activators played an important role in the formation of Fe3C@ N-CNPC 3D materials. On the one hand, the activator endowed the carbonaceous materials with a high proportion of micropores and large surface area. On the other hand, Fe nanoparticles generated by decomposition of FeCl3 catalyzed the growth of intertwined carbon nanotubes on porous carbon, yielding Fe3C@N-CNPC 3D materials with abundant porous structure and a high degree of graphitization. The asprepared Fe3C@N-CNPC were used as anode materials for potassium ion batteries. Due to the synergistic effect of N-doping, superstructure, and large surface area, the Fe3C@N-CNPC based potassium ion batteries exhibited remarkable potassium storage capacity (273 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1) and excellent cycle stability (94% capacity retention at 100 mA g-1 after 570 cycles). This novel carbon material with low cost and ease preparation is of great significance for the application of potassium ion batteries. Meanwhile, our strategy also provides a reference idea for the resource utilization of the distilled grains waste. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Horizontal location; Carbon label; Green product; Carbon emission	PERSONAL NEED; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; CONSUMERS; FOOD; INFORMATION; PERCEPTIONS; PAY	Concerns related to the carbon reduction were evident in the increasingly green consumptions. Can the packaging design of green products facilitate the choice of green products? The authors focused on the "horizontal location effect" of carbon label, whereby placing the carbon label right or left in the visual field of packages. A series of three studies showed that green product packages, such as a package of biscuit, resulted in higher (less) purchase intention when the carbon label placed right (left) in the visual field. The studies provided empirical evidences that the "horizontal location effect" of carbon label was driven by the enhanced perceived environmental importance attached to a product. The authors also examined the moderator (PNS) of the relationship between the horizontal location of the carbon label and consumers' purchase intention. Using real and fictitious packages as stimuli, the authors obtained consistent results, which have profound theoretical and policy implications. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Although the resulting composite photocatalysts display outstanding performances, the lacking of active sites of the 3DGN not only goes against a close contact between the graphene basal plane and TiO2 nanoparticles (weaken electron transport ability) but also limits the efficient adsorption of pollutant molecules. Similar with surface functional groups of the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets, surface defects of the 3DGN can act as the adsorption sites. However, the defect density of the 3DGN is difficult to control (a strict cool rate of substrate and a strict flow of precursor gas are necessary) because of its growth approach (chemical vapor deposition method). In this study, to give full play to the functions of graphene, the RGO nanosheets and 3DGN co-modified TiO2 composite photocatalysts are prepared. After optimizing the mass fraction of the RGO nanosheets in the composite photocatalyst, the resulting chemical adsorption ability and yields of strong oxidizing free radicals increase significantly, indicating the synergy of the RGO nanosheets and 3DGN.

Despite these advantages, the commercialization of LSBs has been obstructed by certain deficiencies, such as the shuttle effect and poor conductivity of sulfur. On one hand, the chemical interactions between polar materials and lithium polysulfides (LPSs) have been investigated by researchers, particularly related to the shuttle effect. On the other hand, for improving the performance of LSBs, the conductivity of nonpolar materials has also received increased attention. Here, recent research advances involving polar and nonpolar materials for use in LSBs have been reviewed, particularly focusing on the polar interaction toward fixing LPSs, conductivity improvement, and electrochemical performance of LSBs. Subsequently, we have summarized and discussed a combination of polar and nonpolar materials for comprehensively promoting the performance of LSBs. In conclusion, the prospects and research directions for materials that can improve the cycle life and rate performance of LSBs have also been proposed.

Anchoring LiPS and accelerating the electrochemical reaction of the S electrodes can improve the electrochemical performance of the battery. Here, a redox-activity organic sulfide poly(2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole) (PDMcT)/acetylene black (AB)-modified polypropylene (PP) separator (PDMcT3/AB-PP) is re-ported to be a shuttle-inhibiting layer and electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. PDMcT has a redox potential window similar to that of S. During the discharge/charge process of the Li-S battery, the S-S bond of PDMcT is broken and forms DMcT.LiSx (x = 4-8). This is helpful for anchoring LiPSs and electrocatalyzing the electrochemical con -version reaction of sulfur, which can effectively restrain the shuttle effect of LiPSs and accelerate the speed of the electrochemical reaction. The high electrolyte affinity of AB with good electronic conductivity improves the electrolyte wettability of the separator, which is conducive to the rapid transport of lithium ions and improves the rate performance of the Li-S battery. Compared with the PP (284 mAh gS(-1)) and AB-PP separators (617 mAh gS(-1)), the sulfur electrode with the PDMcT3/AB-PP separator delivers a high discharge specific capacity of 821 mAh gS(-1) at 0.2 mA cm(-2.) With such a functional composite separator, a greatly increased specific capacity and improved cyclability are achieved for the S electrode. In lithium (or sodium) sulfur batteries, this type of compound containing a similar S-S bond structure can inhibit the shuttle effect of LiPS and adjust the kinetic behavior of the LiPS conversion reaction.

The carbohydrate and protein present in the black gram were converted to nitrogen-enriched carbon structures during the charring as evidenced by elemental analysis and Raman spectrum. The black gram char derived activated carbon materials (BGC) were characterized by elemental analysis, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, XPS and N-2 gas adsorption-desorption studies. The nitrogen content, textural properties and CO2 adsorption capacities of the black gram derived activated carbon (BGC-x-y) depend on the KOH to black gram char ratio (x) and activation temperature (y). The highest surface area (2305 m(2) g(-1)) and total pore volume (1.23 cm(3) g(-1)) were exhibited by BGC-3-800 whereas the highest micropore volume (0.397 cm(3) g(-1)) was obtained for BGC-1-700. The nitrogen (1.78 to 5.34 wt%) in the amorphous BGC-x-y materials was present in the pyrolic, pyridinic, quaternary and N-oxide forms. The highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.46 and 5.3 mmol g(-1) at 25 and 0 degrees C, respectively, at 1 atmosphere was achieved for BGC-1-700. The physical adsorption (heat of adsorption: -39 to -35 kJ mol(-1)) of CO2 is mainly due to micropore filling as the adsorption capacity increases with micropore volume. The CO2 adsorption on BGC-1-700 showed very good selectivity over nitrogen adsorption and excellent recyclability over five adsorption-desorption cycles.

Based on the hydrophobic nature of dietary fats, a new kind of gustatory biosensor with odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) modified screen printed electrodes was designed for sensing the "fat taste". Through electrochemical reduction, graphene oxide was modified on the carbon electrodes to form a sheet that comprised graphene domains with residual oxygen-containing functional groups, which could increase the electrode conductivity and be used for protein immobilization. For fat taste sensing, taste substances of medium- and long-chain fatty acids, such as lauric acid, linoleic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, were detected through cyclic voltammetry. Moreover, the sensor showed high affinities to medium- and long-chain fatty acids comparing to the tastants of other five primaries tastes. The gustatory biosensor offered a powerful analytic technique for detecting fat taste substances, which seem to be an alternative to labor-intensive and time-consuming cell-based assays or animal experiments. Furthermore, it could be treated as the sensory evaluation panels for food and beverage industry, and even for disease managements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By chemically binding TNT-specific peptides with GO, the biosensor gained unique optoelectronic properties and high biological sensitivity, with transducing bimolecular bonding into optical signals. Through UV absorption detection, increasing absorbance responses could be observed in presence of TNT at different concentrations, as low as 4.40 x 10(-9) mM, and showed dose-dependence and stable behavior. Specific responses of the biosensor were verified with the corporation of 2,6-dinitrotoluene (DNT), which had similar molecular structure to TNT. Thus, with high sensitivity and selectivity, the biosensor provided a convenient approach for detection of explosives as miniaturizing and integrating devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, most top-performing MOFs for hydrogen storage require strict synthesis conditions and high cost, which limits their wide applications. In this work, Cu-BTC/graphene aerogel (GA) composite is prepared at room temperature with improved hydrogen uptake at 100 bar compared with pristine Cu-BTC. To understand the mechanism of the enhanced hydrogen uptakes in the composite, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation is executed for Cu-BTC/GA composites with different numbers of graphene oxide (GO) layers. It is demonstrated that the increased hydrogen uptake in Cu-BTC/GA composites is mainly ascribed to the hydrogen uptake in the interface region between Cu-BTC and GA. Additionally, the hydrogen uptake of the CuBTC/GA composites decreases as the number of GO layers increases, implicating that fewer GO layers or thinner GA is favorable for hydrogen adsorption of Cu-BTC/GA composites.

Compared with spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), the anisotropic structure of AuNSs, which concentrates the electric charge density on its sharp tips, could enhance the local electromagnetic field and the electronic coupling effect significantly. cGO was obtained by a diazonium reaction of graphene oxide (GO) with 4-aminobenzoic acid. Compared with GO, cGO could immobilize more antibodies due to the abundant carboxylic groups on its surface. Testing results show that there are fairly large improvements in the analytical performance of the SPR biosensor using cGO/AuNSs-antigen conjugate, and the detection limit of the proposed biosensor is 0.0375 mu g mL(-1), which is 32 times lower than that of graphene oxide-based biosensor.

However, the dissolution of high-order lithium selenides and the shuttle effect in electrolytes lead to low Se utilization, inferior capacity and poor cycling performance. Herein, a heteroatoms (N and O) dual-doped hierarchical porous carbon (HDHPC) with interconnected macro/meso/micropores is used to confine Se composite and developed as a cathode material for advanced Li/Na-Se batteries in low-cost carbonate electrolyte. For Li-Se batteries, Se/ HDHPC cathode delivers an initial charge capacity of 613 mAh g(-1) and maintains stable reversible capacity of 545 mAh g(-1) with a capacity decay as low as 0.0074% per cycle after 1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C (1 C= 675 mA g(-1)). For Na-Se batteries, Se/HDHPC exhibits a high initial charge capacity of 619 mAh g(-1) and retains as high as 402 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at a current rate of 0.5 C. Moreover, Se/HDHPC composite also exhibits an excellent rate performance both in the Li-Se and Na-Se batteries even at a high rate up to 20 C (13.5 A g(-1)). Such excellent electrochemical properties of Se/HDHPC are mainly contributed from two aspects. One is the hierarchical porous structure of the HDHPC, which benefit the penetration of electrolyte and also act as micro reaction chambers to effectively suppress the volume change of the electrode. The other is the strong interaction between lithium/sodium selenide and carbon host induced by heteroatoms (N and O) dual-doping, which can strongly anchor the Se-contained species, thus preventing the side reaction of Se anions with electrolyte.

In combination, these results indicate that sulfur in UMC exists as linear polymeric sulfur rather than smaller allotropes. The electrochemical reactivity of lithium with sulfur confined in UMC (pore size <= 0.7 nm) is different from that of sulfur confined in microporous carbon (<= 2 nm, or ultramicroporous carbon containing significant amount of micropores) and mesoporous carbon (> 2 nm). The observed quasi-solid-state reaction of lithium with sulfur in UMC with a single voltage plateau during the discharge/charge process is due to the effective separation of solvent molecules from the active material. The size of carbon pores plays a vital role in determining the reaction path of lithium with sulfur confined in UMC.	[Helen, M.; Schindler, Stefan; Behm, R.

Recent studies have suggested that designing nanostructured hosts is an effective approach for resolving chronic issues of Li metal anodes, such as dendrite growth and dead Li generation. Nevertheless, the scalability of the nanostructured materials has been insufficiently recognized and discussed. Herein, we demonstrate a facile and scalable synthesis of free-standing reduced graphene oxide, utilizing the ice-templating method, and its application as a deposition host for the metallic Li. The synthesized graphene framework features a microchannel structure, which is propitious for accommodating large amounts of Li metal and stabilizing the solid electrolyte interphase layer. We fabricated the ice-templated graphene into a Li metal pouch cell and demonstrated an excellent coulombic efficiency of 97% for 200 cycles and a superior cycle life up to 980 h. Additionally, the Li-S full-cell delivered a high areal capacity of 8.5 mAh cm(-2). Our results highlight that the microchannel graphene-based architecture is critical for minimizing the unrestricted growth of Li dendrites and alleviating the large volume changes.

However, the applicable S contents of pPAN/S are usually lower than 50 weight % (wt %), and their capacity utilizations are not sufficient, both of which greatly limit their energy densities for commercial applications. We report a pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile/selenium disulfide (pPAN/SeS2) composite with dramatically enhanced active material content (63 wt %) and superior performances for both lithium and sodium storage. As a result, pPAN/SeS2 delivers high capacity of >1100 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) for Li storage with extremely stable cycle life over 2000 cycles at 4.0 A g(-1). Moreover, when applied in a room temperature Na-SeS2 battery, pPAN/SeS2 achieves superior capacity of >900 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and delivers prolonged cycle life over 400 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1).

Three types of graphene sheets were used: graphene oxide (GO), hydrazine-reduced GO (hyd-rGO), and hydrothermally treated GO in an ammonia solution (amm-rGO). amm-rGO possessing pyridinic-N atoms produced the highest etching rates of the graphene used for all water temperatures tested. We propose that graphene sheets catalyze Ge oxidation underneath the sheets and that this phenomenon probably originates from the enhanced adsorption of O-2 molecules in water at local defects, such as graphene edges and carbon atoms next to pyridinic-N, in the sheets. Because O-2 adsorption is the initial step of either the oxygen reduction reaction or direct oxidation, it results in the formation of soluble GeO2 at the graphene/Ge interface, leaving etched hollows under the sheets. In addition, we combined graphene-assisted chemical etching with lithography by using photoresist to fabricate a trench pattern on Ge.

Here, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) crystals were in situ synthesized on the skeletons of melamine foam (MF). After the pyrolysis at high temperature, ZIF-8/MF precursors were carbonized into three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous N doped carbon/carbon foam (PNC/CF) with large surface area, good electrical conductivity and mechanical property. Thus, PNC/CF achieves high specific capacitance of 250.6 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and excellent rate performance. Furthermore, the constructed symmetrical supercapacitor based on PNC/CF delivers a maximum energy density of 14.2 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 375 W kg(-1) and superior cycling stability of 98.4%. The superior capacitive performance can be assigned to 3D hierarchically porous structure with a suitable surface area, good wettability of between electrodes and aqueous electrolyte, and relatively high electronic conductivity of PNC/CF.

The as-prepared Co3O4-T exhibit superior cycling performances, rate capabilities and strong cycling stability when used as the electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). The Co3O4-T electrode delivers a high specific capacity of similar to 1081 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles in LIBs. Besides, it also shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1049.3 mAh g-1 and low overpotential of 154 mV at 0.2 C in LSBs. These excellent electrochemical performances of Co3O4-T electrode are attributed to the unique tubular structure with small-sized mesoporous, which facilitates Li+ diffusion and enhances structural robustness.

Here, we develop a novel method to synthesize interior-structured mesoporous carbon microspheres (MCMs), based on the surfactant assembly within water droplet-confined spaces. Our approach is shown to access a library of unprecedented MCMs such as hollow MCMs, multi-chambered MCMs, bijel-structured MCMs, multi-cored MCMs, "solid" MCMs, and honeycombed MCMs. These novel structures, unattainable for the conventional bulk synthesis even at the same conditions, suggest an intriguing effect arising from the droplet-confined spaces. This synthesis method and the hitherto unfound impact of the droplet-confined spaces on the microstructural evolution open up new horizons in exploring novel materials for innovative applications.

Metal-coordinated nitrogen-doped graphene is attractive since its use as a cathode material for the PEMFC. The mechanism of O-2 activation and hydrogenation on TiN4 embedded graphene has been investigated in terms of the dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) method. It is found that: 1) O-2 prefers to stay on top of the Ti atom with the side-on configuration, forming the O-Ti-O three-member ring with an adsorption energy of 4.96 eV. 2) According to the Mulliken atomic charges analysis, the absorbed O-2 molecule are negatively charged by 0.60 e in the side-on configuration. 3) Upon the chemisorption of the O-2 on TiN4-graphene, there are two possible pathways during the activation of the O-2 molecule: dissociation and hydrogenation. In the dissociation pathway, the adsorbed O-2 molecule is first dissociated into two O atoms, with a fairly big reaction barrier of 0.95 eV and an endothermic reaction energy of 0.20 eV. Subsequently, the two O atoms are hydrogenated into O+ OH with a reaction barrier of 0.40 eV and an exothermic reaction energy of 2.46 eV. In the hydrogenation pathway, the reaction barrier of the hydrogenation of the adsorbed O-2 is 0.52 eV. The OOH formed subsequently is dissociated into O+ OH with a small reaction barrier of 0.04 eV and an exothermic reaction of 2.14 eV. The hydrogenation pathways of the adsorbed O-2 is more preferable, and the corresponding rate-limiting step of this pathway is the hydrogenation of the O-2 with a reaction barrier of 0.52 eV and an exothermic reaction energy of 0.64 eV. In summary, the preferable path of the hydrogenation reactions of O-2 on TiN4-Graphene is O-2(ads)+H(ads)-> OOH ((ads))-> O+OH(ads). Current results may be benefitial to the design of new electrocatalyst materials based on graphene.

Yet despite the promising advances of affinity grids over the past decades, no single strategy has demonstrated general utility. Here we chemically functionalize cryo-EM grids coated with mostly one or two layers of graphene oxide to facilitate affinity capture. The protein of interest is tagged using a system that rapidly forms a highly specific covalent bond to its cognate catcher linked to the grid via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer. Importantly, the spacer keeps particles away from both the air-water interface and the graphene oxide surface, protecting them from potential denaturation and rendering them sufficiently flexible to avoid preferential sample orientation concerns. Furthermore, the PEG spacer successfully reduces nonspecific binding, enabling high-resolution reconstructions from a much cruder lysate sample.

However, high sulfurization temperature results in loss of nitrogen atoms, which leads to imperfect SPAN structure and is not conducive to fast electron transfer. A high efficiency vulcanizing agent of S2Cl2 was used to reduce the reaction temperature in this work. We found that S2Cl2 promotes PAN cyclization, reduces the cyclization reaction temperature, and avoids the loss of nitrogen atoms and the agglomeration of SPAN primary particles in high-temperature reactions. The SPAN cathode material prepared using S2Cl2 has a more regular structure six-membered ring main chain structure and a smaller primary particle size, which is beneficial to the rapid conduction of electrons and lithium ions in the electrode material. The electrochemical test results confirmed that the SPAN cathode material prepared by S2Cl2 has higher active material utilization, better cycle stability, and better rate performance.

The electrochemical performance of N-doped porous carbon material as well as undoped porous carbon (PC) was studied by galvanostatic discharge measurements and steady-state linear polarization. Because of the existence of doping N atom, the N-PC exhibits a nice electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solutions. In addition, the N-PC loaded air electrode performs a high discharge voltage of 1.36 Vat a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in aluminium/air battery, which should be attributed to highly efficient, new and active sites created by N doping.

Among all candidates being explored, lithium-sulfur batteries are a very promising system to be commercialized in the near future. Towards this end, the development of lithium sulfide (Li2S) nanocrystal-based cathodes has received tremendous effort and witnessed multiple reviews. Differentiated from the focus on performance improvement in previous reviews, this review summarizes the research progress in line with the approaches of materials synthesis and electrode fabrication. The key chemistry, operation procedure, materials characterizations and performance assessments are all given a balanced description. Moreover, all approaches are collectively analyzed along the lines of six criteria towards practical applications, i.e., electrode performance, materials quality, resources sustainability, production cost, operation procedure, and consumed energy. Finally, some perspective viewpoints on the future research directions are offered. (C) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

We used the first-principles calculations to explore the interface between Li2S cathode and beta-Li3PS4 (lithium thiophosphate, LPS) solid electrolyte, including lattice structure, mechanical, electrical properties, interface contact type, and charge distribution in real space. It is found that the interface is significantly reconstructed, and the Li atoms at the interface move mainly parallel to the interface plane. The interface density states introduce metallic properties, mainly contributed by the Li-s and S-s, -p orbitals in Li2S and S-p orbitals in LPS. The highest occupied molecular orbitals of the LPS electrolyte are lower than the electrochemical potential (Fermi level) of the Li2S cathode, thus the electrolyte and cathode materials are reasonable and stable in thermodynamics. Interface density of states shows electrons on the interface do not penetrate from Li2S into LPS, and do not leak electrons to cause electron conduct in LPS. Besides, the interface is an n-type Schottky barrier with a barrier value of 1.0 eV. The work-function of the interface indicates that there is a space charge layer (SCL) by the redistribution of electrons, which is in agreement with the result of interface charge density difference. The electron/hole pairs will be separate, realizing high current charge and discharge capability because of the SCL.

The introduction of spacers into graphene layers always results in a change in the intrinsic properties of graphene and/or induces complexity at the interfaces. Here we show the synthesis of an intrinsically unstacked double-layer templated graphene via template-directed chemical vapour deposition. The as-obtained graphene is composed of two unstacked graphene layers separated by a large amount of mesosized protuberances and can be used for high-power lithium-sulphur batteries with excellent high-rate performance. Even after 1,000 cycles, high reversible capacities of ca. 530mA h g (-1) and 380mA h g (-1) are retained at 5 C and 10 C, respectively. This type of double-layer graphene is expected to be an important platform that will enable the investigation of stabilized three-dimensional topological porous systems and demonstrate the potential of unstacked graphene materials for advanced energy storage, environmental protection, nanocomposite and healthcare applications.

Although there have been extensive reports on MXenes, the most distinguishing features of MXenes have been ignored, namely larger, adjustable interlayer spacing and rich surface chemistry (adsorbed functional groups on the surface and surface electronegativity), which make MXenes different from other two-dimensional materials. By changing the type of active materials, substituting graphene with MXenes to prepare MXene-based composites in a sequential manner is easy, which does not make much sense for the development of MXenes. Based on this view as well as considering the distinguishing nature of MXenes, we mainly discuss the various preparation methods of MXenes and their stability, and we summarize their applications in high-capacity anodes, metal anodes, and lithium-sulfur batteries, particularly pillared MXenes. We highlight the viewpoints on the basis of their components (individual MXenes or MXene-based composites) and adjustable interlayer engineering by using the pillaring technology, which are based on the distinguishing properties of MXenes. Finally, conclusions and perspectives, together with potential proposals for MXenes and their composites in the energy storage field, are also outlined.

After simulation by the FDTD method, the numerical results show that the absorption spectrum based on the periodic array structure of graphene exhibits three perfect absorption peaks in the terahertz band, corresponding to 25.53 mu m, 36.44 mu m and 53.44 mu m, respectively, and they all reach 99% absorption rate. By changing the gate voltage, the material parameters of graphene can be easily adjusted, so as to achieve dynamic control of the absorption characteristics of the absorber. Due to the high symmetry of the structure, it has a good angular polarization tolerance in the far infrared band. In addition, the obvious spectral shift caused by the change of surrounding environment refractive index and the values of sensitivity (S) and figure of merit (FOM) are all indicates that our absorber has certain application prospects in the field of sensing. Furthermore, our absorber has shown great application potential in light detection in infrared and terahertz band as a consequence of the strong tunability.

Nevertheless, its application is restricted by tremendous volume variation and tardy reaction kinetic during discharge/charge process. In this paper, the Ge/3DPG composites with Ge nanoparticles uniformly dispersed in 3D interconnected porous graphene (3DPG) skeleton are successfully prepared using a template-assisted in-situ reduction method. The unique 3D interconnected porous graphene can not only enhance the electronic conductivity and reaction kinetics of the materials, but also provide sufficient buffer space to effectively mitigate the volume expansion during cycling and strengthen the structural integrity. Moreover, the small-sized Ge nanoparticles in close conjunction with the 3D graphene can boost the surface-controlled reaction of the electrode, which contributes to a fast charge-discharge rate capability. The Ge/3DPG composite with optimized Ge/graphene mass ratio delivers high reversible specific capacity (1102 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C), outstanding rate capability (494 mAh g(-1) at 5 C), and admirable cycling stability (85.3% of capacity retention after 250 cycles at 0.5 C). This work provides a significant inspiration for the design and fabrication of advanced Ge-based anode materials for next-generation high-performance LIBs.

Herein, by manipulating the anion-exchange process between Ni-Co acetate microcrystals and various organic anions, porous single- or multi-layered hierarchically functionalized carbon nanoshells are customized. Among them, the shell-in-shell composite, namely C-NiCoPi@C-Ni2Co, which has an external Ni2Co-decorated carbon nanoshell and an internal Ni3P-anchored carbon nanoshell encapsulated within a 3D-structured continuous NiCo-phosphate (NiCoPi) layer, displays collective merits as a sulfur host. Particularly, compared with discrete nanoparticles, the network-like NiCoPi layer is structurally and inherently advantageous in chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides, as also supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, while the metallic Ni2Co nanoparticles enable high local conductivity. Such S@C-NiCoPi@C-Ni2Co displays an initial specific capacity of 1237 mAhg(-1) at 0.1 C and maintains 1010 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles; at 0.5 C, its discharge specific capacity in the 1st cycle is as high as 1038 mAhg(-1) and maintains capacity retention as high as 86% after 500 cycles. This study provides a straightforward strategy in customizing multifunctional sulfur hosts for high-performance Li-S batteries.

And then the bismaleimide (BMI) matrix composites with aligned GNS-Fe3O4@PZM are fabricated under a magnetic field to take full advantage of the tribological properties of graphene. Characterization results reveal that the 0.8 wt% aligned GNS-Fe3O4@PZM/BMI composite has the lowest friction coefficient and volume wear rate compared with non-aligned GNS-Fe3O4@PZM/BMI and aligned GNS-Fe3O4/BMI composites under all the test conditions. In addition, the aligned GNS-Fe3O4@PZM/BMI also shows superior mechanical properties and thermal stability. The excellent properties of aligned GNS-Fe3O4@PZM/BMI result from uniformly distribution and parallel alignment of graphene in the BMI matrix, as well as good interface interaction between GNS-Fe3O4@PZM and BMI matrix.

The MnO2 hollow spheres not only provide physical confinement for the polysulfide species but also enable strong chemical interactions between polysulfide species and oxides, while the added polysulfide furnishes a mass buffering effect and compensates for the capacity losses due to partial cathode dissolution during discharge. The capacity retentions of S/KB, S/KB/LiPS, S/KB/MnO2, and S/KB/MnO2/LiPS composite cathodes are 31%, 45%, 59%, and 91% respectively. The remarkable capacity retention of the S/KB/LiPS/MnO2 composite electrode is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between MnO2 and polysulfide additives.

Polar metal oxides always possess high adsorption to polar S species, while conductive metal nitrides show fast electron transport and ensure fast redox reaction of S species. The combination merits of metal oxides and metal nitrides in one provide an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of LSBs. In this work, defect design of niobium oxynitrides highly dispersed on graphene (NbON-G) is evaluated as effective trapper and catalyst for S species. Owning to the effective structural merits including enriched active sites, alleviated volume variation, defect modulated electronic property, and in-situ chemisorption and catalytic conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), the LSBs with NbON-G modified separator show remarkably enhanced performance compared to NbN-G and Nb2O5-G. Surprisingly, even at low temperature of -40 degrees C, the LSBs with NbON-G can operate for 1,000 cycles with 0.04% capacity decay per cycle (Rate: 2 C).

However, the corresponding properties under the long wavelength irradiation is far from expected. In this study, a series of RGO samples with well-designed N impurity and optimized surface functional groups are prepared and employed during hybridization with TiO2 (named N-RGO/TiO2). The coupling between the doped N atoms and surface functional groups is analyzed based on the resulting photocatalytic performances, and the specific mechanism is revealed by the EPR, IR and lifetime of the photoinduced electrons. After comparing the corresponding performances of the RGO/TiO2 and RGO/N-TiO2 specimens, the results show that the surface functional groups of the RGO serve as a precondition to achieve pi-d coupling between the graphene basal plane and TiO2 nanoparticles, while N atoms in the RGO enhance the resulting photoactivity under a long wavelength range (>510 nm). The findings provide a potential approach to promote the photocatalytic properties of graphene-based composite photocatalysts with the low-energy incident photons.

Co-doping with heteroatoms has been confirmed to be an effective strategy to significantly promote the electrical conductivity of carbon. Moreover, there is no simple and green method to construct sensitive HTC based electrochemical biosensors until now. In this paper, N and S dualdoped carbon (NS-C) with ultra-low charge transfer resistance is easily synthesized from L-cysteine and glucose in a hydrothermal reaction system. The morphology, structural properties and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared NS-C are analyzed. In comparison with the undoped hydrothermal (UC) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE), the charge transfer resistance of UC (476 Omega) is ten times the value of NS-C (46 Omega). The developed biosensor shows a better performance to detect glucose in a wide concentration range (50-2500 mu mol L-1) with the detection limit of 1.77 mu mol L-1 (S/N= 3) and a high sensitivity (0.0554 mu A cm(-2) mu mol(-1) L). The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant value of GCE/NS-C/GOx/nafion modified electrode is 0.769 mmol L-1, indicating a high affinity of glucose oxidase to glucose. These results demonstrate that the hydrothermal method is an effective way for preparing high electrical conductivity carbon with excellent performances in biosensor application.

Poly(ethylene-oxide) with LiCF3SO3 Was used as a solid polymer electrolyte for Li/S cell. Sulfur content of the sulfur electrode was 70wt%, and the carbon content was varied from 10wt% to 25wt%. The weight ratio of PEO and LiCF3SO3 in the polymer electrolyte was 9:1. The lithium/PEO/sulfur cell showed two plateau potential regions (2.4V, 2.1V) and high discharge capacity, i.e., 1068mAh/g(63.7% utilization of sulfur). The discharge capacity decreased drastically during charge-discharge cycling. The capacity fade depended on the composition of sulfur electrode regardless of similar initial discharge capacity. The sulfur electrode with high carbon content retained high capacity after repeated cycling. The optimum composition of 70wt% sulfur electrode was composed of 20wt% carbon and 10% PEO.

Hard structures can provide stable and rigid scaffolds as well as hierarchically porous structures for superior physical properties; however, they often suffer from relatively poor surface chemistry. Construction of soft materials functionalized hard structures often generates new composite materials with unique physico-chemical properties for synergistically boosting high-efficient energy conversion/storage and biosensing. In this review, starting with introduction of fundamentals and properties of soft materials and hard structures, advances in fabrications and characterizations of the composite materials are discussed. The excellent physico-chemical and electrochemical properties of the soft materials-built and functionalized composite materials as well as their applications as electrode materials in solar cells, fuel cells, electrochemical water splitting, lithium-ion batteries/lithium-sulfur batteries/supercapacitors, and in situ molecular biosensing for greatly improved performance are surveyed. The performance enhancement mechanisms in these electrochemical systems are discussed to elicit fundamental insights. The challenges and prospects of this research area are also deliberated to inspire future improvements.

Most importantly, such a bandgap transition is reversible and can be controlled by the alternative treatment of UV irradiation and dark storage. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to reveal the underlying mechanism of bandgap behavior in this reversible transition. Both experimental and computational results demonstrate that it is a promising technology for applications of graphene in electronic devices.

It is shown that IGC, at infinite dilution, applies poorly to carbon blacks and provides only apparent and excessively high values of gamma-s(d) (a few hundreds of mJ/m2). IGC, at finite concentration, readily allows the obtention of n-alkanes, benzene, and chloroform adsorption isotherms from which various thermodynamic values are computed (spreading pressure pi, isosteric enthalpy of adsorption, surface energy characteristics). The gamma-s(d) values calculated from pi-e are in the 80-120 mJ/m2 range (i.e. values which are in fair agreement with published data on graphite or graphitized carbons). Further, the specific interaction potential of polar probes is in relation, as expected, with the oxygen content of the carbons. Finally, from the adsorption isotherms, the adsorption energy distribution function is computed, supposing a patchwise distribution of adsorption sites. The results confirm the high surface heterogeneity of carbon blacks and the influence of surface treatments, but indicate also major differences between carbon blacks from different preparation processes.

Normal wustite, which was kept in a He atmosphere at 573 K for 10 min, undergoes eutectoid decomposition into active wustite (Fe0.98O) and stoichiometric magnetite. Compared with normal wustite, active wustite is more unstable and it is active for decomposing carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide (1.013 x 10(5) Pa) was almost completely reduced into carbon by active wustite at 573 K, which was associated with the transformation of active wustite into stoichiometric magnetite. The oxygen in CO2 is considered to be transferred to the surface of wustite in the form of O2- ions and then these ions react with excess iron ions from the inside of the oxide to form the spinel structure. In order to maintain the electrical neutrality of the oxide, active wustite releases electrons, which will move to the surface and be donated to the carbon in CO2; therefore the carbon is reduced. The reduction of CO2 into carbon is undergone via two steps: CO2 --> CO --> C, the former step, CO2 --> CO, is the control step of the reaction speed and CO is the intermediate of this reaction, because the speed of CO conversion is faster than that of CO2 when CO was produced in the process of the reaction. During the reaction, the partial pressure of CO2 decreased gradually with increasing reaction time and finally the reaction system became a vacuum. Elevating reaction temperature, the speed of CO2 decomposition increased and the content of CO produced in the reaction process decreased. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

Herein, for the first time we show that the single atom catalyst can play a compelling role in boosting the electrochemical conversion kinetics and achieving previously-unreachable ultra-high-rate performance. Both experimental and theoretical results prove that atomically-dispersed single iron atoms promote the delithiation of relatively-inert Li2S cathode and accelerate the reversible electrochemical conversion reactions during its long-term cycling. The work demonstrates the effectiveness of single atom catalysis in improving the performance of Li2S/Li batteries (588 mAh g(-1) at 12 C and capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 5 C) and opens a new route to breaking the rate limit for other future conversion-based high energy batteries.

However, the assembly of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) in 3D graphene structure is usually a complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate a strategy of fast assembling Ag3PO4 NPs within 3D graphene aerogels (GAs) with a facile in situ ion filtration-precipitation method, in which the sequential filtration of Ag+ and PO43- solutions through the porous 3D graphene structure enables the fast assembly of well-dispersed Ag3PO4 NPs throughout the 3D GAs. The 3D GAs not only prevent the agglomeration of Ag3PO4 NPs due to the porous and interconnected microstructure but also promote the separation of photo-generated charges in Ag3PO4 due to the excellent electrical conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) that composes 3D GAs. As a result, the 3D Ag3PO4/GAs composite shows a considerable enhancement in both the activity and stability in photocatalytic oxygen evolution from water splitting when compared with pristine Ag3PO4. In addition to Ag3PO4 NPs, the in situ ion filtration-precipitation method is also feasible for fast assembling other semiconductor NPs in 3D graphene structures (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Enhancement of CO detection in Al doped graphene	CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							CARBON NANOTUBES; CHEMICAL SENSORS; GAS SENSOR; AB-INITIO; ADSORPTION; MOLECULES; GRAPHITE; HYDROGEN; SOLIDS; OXYGEN	A principle of the enhancement of CO adsorption was developed theoretically by using density functional theory through doping Al into graphene. The results show that the Al doped graphene has strong chemisorption of CO molecule by forming Al-CO bond, where CO onto intrinsic graphene remains weak physisorption. Furthermore, the enhancement of CO sensitivity in the Al doped graphene is determined by a large electrical conductivity change after adsorption, where CO absorption leads to increase of electrical conductivity via introducing large amount of shallow acceptor states. Therefore, this newly developed Al doped graphene would be an excellent candidate for sensing CO gas. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ao, Z.

Here, we present new composites obtained by mixing sulfur with carbon fibres. These composites possess a specific charge higher than 1200 mA h g(-1) of sulfur, and exhibit hardly any fading during cycling. We performed for the first time high resolution in situ X-ray diffraction to understand the role of the composite template. Surprisingly after 1 cycle the beta-sulfur phase was formed, stable normally only above 96 degrees C. A post-mortem analysis was also performed to show the impact of cycling as well as the storage of the powder.

Compared to other synthetic technologies, surfactant templating method offers the most efficient way to improve electrochemical performances of energy storage materials. In the synthesis of energy storage materials prepared, various surfactants are often used and play a crucial role in determining the properties of final products. Multifunctional surfactants can effectively tailor and control particle size, crystallinity, morphology, porosity, structure and composition of energy storage materials, achieving significant enhancement in rate capability and cycle stability. Herein, we summarize various surfactants, including classic alkyl-based surfactants, polymers, biological ligands and other surface active molecules. This review highlights the essential roles of surfactants, working as structure-directing agents, carbon sources, porogens and stabilizer agents, etc., in controlling nanostructure of energy storage materials and improving their properties. For different batteries (such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-oxygen batteries and alkaline batteries) and supercapacitors, similarities and differences in surfactant mechanism, functions, electrochemical performances of the synthesized materials, challenges and opportunities are discussed as well. To facilitate further development of surfactant template method, some future research trends and directions are finally put forward.

Compositions and Formation Mechanisms of Solid-Electrolyte Interphase on Microporous Carbon/Sulfur Cathodes	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; CARBONATE-BASED ELECTROLYTE; LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; STATE LITHIATION; ION; GRAPHITE; LI+; REDUCTION; ETHYLENE; SOLVATION	We report the formation mechanism and compositions of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a microporous carbon/sulfur (MC/S) cathode in Li-S batteries using a carbonate-based electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate, v:v = 1:1). Through characterizations using 1D and 2D solution-phase nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, coupled with model chemical reactions and DFT calculations, we have identified two critical roles of Li+ in steering the SEI formation. First, the preferential solvation of Li+ by EC in the mixed carbonate electrolyte renders EC as the dominant participant in the SEI formation, and second, Li+ coordination to the EC carbonyl alters activation barriers and changes the reaction pathways relative to Na+. The main organic components in the SEI are identified as lithium ethylene monocarbonate and lithium methyl carbonate, which are virtually identical to those formed on Li and graphite anodes of lithium-ion batteries but via a different pathway.

Its precursor, PAN, directly determines the performances of cathode materials, including the sulfur content and its utilization for S@pPAN composite materials. Adopting PAN with the molecular weight approaching 550,000 as the precursor, the sulfur content in S@pPAN approaches 55 wt %, and its reversible specific capacity was 901 mAh g(-1) (composite) at 50 degrees C with sulfur utilization over 98%. Moreover, it enabled stable cycling and excellent high rate capability with a specific capacity of 645 mAh g(-1) at 5 C. These significantly enhanced electrochemical properties are mainly due to the high molecular weight of the PAN precursor, which provides more space to accommodate amorphous sulfur, along with improved interfacial resistance of S@pPAN.

However, most of these electrode materials give a low capacitance, which leads to low energy density. Cu-doped biomass-derived activated carbons (Cu-ACs) were synthesized using a simple, low-cost carbonization and KOH activation method. The copper nanoparticles had mixed valence states (CuO, Cu2O, Cu0) and were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the AC. Due to the fast electron/ion transfer paths provided by the pore structure, and an accelerated redox reaction between the three Cu species, the Cu-ACs achieved an excellent capacitive performance. In a three-electrode system, the Cu-AC sample prepared by KOH activation with a KOH/ (Cu+char)mass ratio of 2 had a high specific capacitance of 360 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), 1.21 times that of AC (163 F g(-1)). When it was fabricated into a symmetric capacitor, the device had a good electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 143.44 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and a good cyclic stability with an 81.8% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles.

In this study, chitosan was used as precursor for carbon, and SiO2 nanoparticles were selected as the template for mesopores. The spray drying technique was adopted for the fabrication of silica/chitosan microspheres. Porous carbon with hierarchical macro/meso/micro pores was obtained through a facile one-pot high temperature treatment, in which the pyrolysis of the chitosan precursor, removal of the silica template, and introduction of macropores coordinatively occur using PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) binder as a silica etchant and also as a macropore director. This approach not only simplifies the fabrication processes but also yields regular honeycomb-like carbon with macro/meso/micro-sized hierarchical pore structure with high specific surface areas up to 1011 m(2) g(-1). A supercapacitor assembled with porous carbon as the electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 250.5 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) using 6 mol L-1 KOH as the electrolyte in a three-electrode system.

The influence of structure parameters including specific surface area and porous structure of porous carbon and resultant carbon/Se composite on electrochemical properties are studied. It is found a moderate micropore size of carbon substrate and low specific surface area of carbon/Se composite are benefit to electrochemical performances. At an optimal temperature of 700 degrees C, the porous carbon composed of micro- and small meso-porous (2-4 nm) structure has a BET specific surface area of 695.4 m(2) g(-1), and the amorphous Se is uniformly encapsulated into its porous structure. As the cathode material of Li ion battery, the porous carbon nanoplate/Se composite delivers an initial discharge capacity of 589.2 mAh g(-1) with Coulombic efficiency of 72.6% at 0.2C, and capacity retention of 78.3% can be obtained after 500 cycles at 2C. Even at a high rate of 4C, a discharge capacity of 415.2 mAh g(-1) can be reached.

Still, these heterostructures developed so far primarily rely on high-temperature ammonification with corrosive NH3 or synthetic nitrogen-contained reagents as nitrogen sources, casting potential environmental hazards, and additional technical challenges. Herein, a multichambered carbon nanofiber host architecture with an in-built TiN/TiO2 heterostructure configuration derived from natural structured proteins is designed. The TiN/TiO2 heterostructure is spontaneously generated in the carbon nanofibers upon the pyrolysis of inborn N-enriched bio-precursor accompanied by thermal-induced topochemical self-nitridation without any additional nitrogen sources. Ex-/in situ experiments with theoretical calculations identify the strong trapping and enhanced charge transfer on the polar heterointerfaces, synchronously realizing the immobilization-diffusion-transformation of polysulfides. The multichambered host framework with rich internal voids and enhanced conductivity promise the accommodation of liquid Li2S6 catholyte, meanwhile ensuring that the cells can work with lean electrolyte. Consequently, the resulted Li-polysulfide cell exhibits an ultralow capacity decay of 0.023% per cycle over 500 cycles and considerable areal capacity (approximate to 6 mAh cm(-2)) at high S loading (5.8 mg cm(-2)). Importantly, an ingenious configurated full battery based on lithiated silicon anode and polysulfide cathode is competent to achieve appreciable cyclability with high energy density even under a low negative/positive capacity ratio (approximate to 1.18).

Quantitative model evaluation of organic carbon oxidation hypotheses for the Ediacaran Shuram carbon isotopic excursion	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Carbon isotope; Shuram Excursion; Dissolved organic carbon; Atmospheric oxygen; Oceanic oxidation	DOUSHANTUO FORMATION; SULFATE CONCENTRATIONS; NORTHWESTERN MEXICO; OCEAN OXYGENATION; SOUTH CHINA; CYCLE; RESERVOIR; HETEROGENEITY; STRATIGRAPHY; VARIABILITY	The largest global carbon-cycle perturbation in Earth history was recorded in the Ediacaran-a persistent negative shift in the global marine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) reservoir that lasted for similar to 25-50 million years, with a nadir of-12aEuro degrees (i.e., the Shuram Excursion, or SE). This event is considered to have been a result of full or partial oxidation of a large dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir, which, if correct, provides evidence for massive DOC storage in the Ediacaran ocean owing to an intensive microbial carbon pump (MCP). However, this scenario was recently challenged by new hypotheses that relate the SE to oxidization of recycled continentally derived organic carbon or hydrocarbons from marine seeps. In order to test these competing hypotheses, this paper numerically simulates changes in global carbon cycle fluxes and isotopic compositions during the SE, revealing that: (1) given oxygen levels in the Ediacaran atmosphere-ocean of 40% PAL, the recycled continental organic carbon hypothesis and the full oxidation of oceanic DOC reservoir hypothesis are challenged by the atmospheric oxygen availability which would have been depleted in 4 and 6 million years, respectively; (2) the marine-seep hydrocarbon oxidation hypothesis is challenged by the exceedingly large hydrocarbon fluxes required to sustain the SE for > 25 Myr; and (3) the heterogeneous (partial) DOC oxidation hypothesis is quantitatively able to account for the SE because the total amount of oxidants needed for partial oxidation (< 50%) of the global DOC reservoir could have been met.

However, pseudocapacitive materials can store energy through faradaic reactions, leading to drastically improved specific capacitance. Herein, mesoporous carbon nanospheres with 3D ordered pore symmetry were synthesized by soft template method. Then, the hydroquinone (HQ) was used to modify mesoporous carbon nanospheres by hydrothermal method. As demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, HQ modified carbon nanospheres show both electric double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. Carbon nanospheres with 10wt% HQ loading possess the highest specific capacitance of 285 F/g at the current density of 0.5 Lambda/g and 212 F/g at 10 Lambda/g, exhibiting excellent rate performance. This should be ascribed to the HQ molecules adsorbed on carbonaceous mesopore surface by pi-pi interactions, which not only provide extra pseudocapacitance, but also improve the rate performance of carbons in aqueous electrolyte.

However, suffering from the uncontrollable deposition, growth of lithium dendrite and the serious volume change within cycling process, the commercial application of lithium anode is impeded by the safety hazards and limited span-life. Here, we demonstrate a kind of bamboo-derived 3D hierarchical porous carbon decorated by ZnO quantum dots which can serve as a lithiophilic scaffold for dendrite-free Li metal anode. This carbon scaffold is stable against the serious volumetric change during cycles. In addition, the 3D porous scaffold can reduce the effective local current density. Most importantly, the lithiophilic ZnO quantum dots within the carbon can be used to induce lithium deposition. Notably, lithium metal up to 131 mAh cm(-2) can be confined within ZnO@HPC, achieving acceptable volume expansion, considerable reduction in overpotential and effective dendrite suppression. Thus, 3D Li within ZnO@HPC scaffold could exhibit better capability and much lower voltage hysteresis when compared with Li foil in cells paired with LiCoO2. The function of the ZnO decorated 3D hierarchical porous carbon scaffold might provide innovative insights into the design principles for metallic lithium anodes.

Interfacial in-situ Al2O3 nanoparticles enhance load transfer in carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced aluminum matrix composites	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Metal-matrix composites (MMCs); Carbon nanotubes (CNTs); Nanoparticles; Interface; Fracture	NANOTUBE/ALUMINUM COMPOSITES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STRENGTH	Dissatisfactory load transfer has been a critical issue in carbon nanotube (CNT)- and graphene-reinforced metal matrix composites (MMCs) mainly because of the intrinsically unpleasant carbon-metal interfaces. Here we show by introducing in-situ Al2O3 nanoparticles at aluminum (Al)-CNTs interface, the load transfer efficiency can be noticeably enhanced in powder metallurgy CNTs/Al composites. From in-situ tensile tests, the nanoparticle-modified Al-CNTs interfaces result in CNT fracture, a sign of high load transfer efficiency; while clean interfaces without nanoparticles lead to CNT pulling-out. The nanoparticle-induced enhancement of interface strength can be explained by the increased sliding resistance of CNTs in MMCs at the wake of cracks under tensile loading. Our study provides a new strategy for designing strong carbon-metal interfaces to fabricate high-performance nanocarbon-reinforced MMCs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The presence of O and S has no apparent physical or structural effect on the final carbon, However, a direct link was found between oxygen and sulfur contents and the irreversible capacity of the electrochemical reaction of Li with these carbons. Apparently Li reacts irreversibly with sulfur and oxygen to form Li-O and Li-S bonds as are found in Li2O and Li2S. According to this model, the irreversible capacity should be directly proportional to the chalcogen content, and this is approximately observed at high chalcogen content.

V2O5/carbon nano-composite was manufactured by forming V2O5 a <...H2O xerogel on the carbon black through a simple wet process. This provides a high surface area with plenty of hydrophilic moieties that can capture and store soluble polysulfides on its surface during the discharge-charge reactions, and also partly contributes to suppressing the excessive formation of Li2S which undergoes a large volume change during the cycling. From the electrochemical results, we could observe a significant reduction in the overcharge amount and improved cyclic performance by adding as little as 2 % of the nano-composite. UV-VIS spectra measured after a small addition of the nano-composite to the solution containing Li2S6 polysulfide also confirmed that the V2O5/carbon nano-composite is highly effective in capturing long-chain polysulfides on its surface.

In this work, the graphene-based MDSPE materials were synthesized using the chemical co-precipitation method, with a maximum enrichment efficiency of 500 times. To improve the detection sensitivity, the complete antigen (E-2-BSA, DES-BSA, and BPA-BSA) was conjugated on the GO-COOH-modified gold chips for signal amplification. Furthermore, the GO-COOH materials could also significantly improve the performance and stability of the immobilized E-2-BSA, DES-BSA, or BPA-BSA conjugations. Real-time SPR signals were obtained while mixing the targets (E-2, DES, BPA) with anti-target monoclonal antibodies (E-2-mAb, DES-mAb, BPA-mAb) at a 1:1 volume ratio. After optimizing the experimental conditions, the minimum detection limits (LOD) of E-2, DES, and BPA were 3.605 x 10(-6)ng/mL, 2.901 x 10(-6)ng/mL, and 5.169 x 10(-5)ng/mL, respectively. This simple, accurate, and stable method combined the advantages of two types of graphene materials to simplify the complicated pre-treatment and detection procedures. This study demonstrates a presumable and general method for detecting estrogen-like small molecules in the environment and in food.

However, similar to other 2D materials, MXene nanosheets are inclined to stack together, limiting the device performance. In order to fully utilize MXenes' electrochemical energy storage capability, here, processing of 2D MXene flakes into hollow spheres and 3D architectures via a template method is reported. The MXene hollow spheres are stable and can be easily dispersed in solvents such as water and ethanol, demonstrating their potential applications in environmental and biomedical fields as well. The 3D macroporous MXene films are free-standing, flexible, and highly conductive due to good contacts between spheres and metallic conductivity of MXenes. When used as anodes for sodium-ion storage, these 3D MXene films exhibit much improved performances compared to multilayer MXenes and MXene/carbon nanotube hybrid architectures in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. This work demonstrates the importance of MXene electrode architecture on the electrochemical performance and can guide future work on designing high-performance MXene-based materials for energy storage, catalysis, environmental, and biomedical applications.

A series of problems caused by Li dendrites, such as low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and a short circuit, have limited the application of Li-metal batteries. In this study, a graphene-modified three-dimensional (3D) Copper (Cu) current collector is addressed to enable dendrite-free U deposition. After Cu foam is immersed into graphene oxide (GO) suspension, a spontaneous reduction of GO, induced by Cu, generates reduced graphene oxide on a 3D Cu (rGO@Cu) substrate. The rGO@Cu foam not only provides large surface area to accommodate Li deposition for lowering the local effective current density, but also forms a rGO protective layer to effectively control the growth of Li dendrites. As current collector, the rGO@Cu foam shows superior properties than commercial Cu foam and planar Cu foil in terms of cycling stability and CE. The rGO@Cu foam delivers a CE as high as 98.5% for over 350 cycles at the current density of 1 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the full cell using LiFePO4 as cathode and Li metal as anode with rGO@Cu foam as current collector (LiFePO4/rGO@Cu-Li) is assembled to prove the admirable capacities and indicates commercialization of Li-metal batteries.

Rice husk char (RHC) was chosen as raw material, polyurethane sponge (PUS) was used as sacrificed template to form inner channel, and corn starch and ZnO were employed as binder and reinforcing filler, respectively. The optimized preparation parameter was determined by adopting of Taguchi experimental design method. Both MCF-RHC and MCF-CAC were made from RHC and commercial activated carbon (CAC) under the same condition, and three reported monolithic carbon adsorbents were selected for comparative study with MCFs. The surface and structural properties were characterized by XRD, SEM, and N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherm analyses. XRD analysis results reveal that MCF-RHC was the composites of carbon, SiO2, and ZnO, and MCF-RHC and MCF-CAC have good potential in organic adsorption. Hierarchical structure of MCF was constructed by inner macro-channel from burning up of PUS and micro- and meso-pores from resultant carbon composite, and these inner macro-channels play a more important role in benzene rapid adsorption. Specific surface area of MCF-RHC was 465.5m(2)g(-1), which included micro- and meso-pores, which mainly come from RHC during the carbonization process. Adsorption kinetics study demonstrated that the benzene equilibrium uptake of MCF-RHC and MCF-CAC was similar, and both of data well fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. However, MCF-RHC has the ability to absorb benzene more quickly, which meets the demand of absorbent utilizing in benzene leakage emergency.

Results showed that the obtained rGO exhibited a higher reversible specific capacity of 561 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) and 166 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 4000 mA g(-1). The excellent cycling stability and high-rate capability of rGO as anodes of lithium-ion battery were attributed to its few layers structure, large-size sheet, and fast transport kinetics of Li-ion and electron on the interface of electrolyte/electrode.

Remarkably, as interlayer for LiS batteries, the TiO-TiO2 heterostructure not only enhances the adsorbability of the interlayer to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) via the Lewis acid-base interactions, but also accelerates the redox reaction kinetics of the LiS batteries dramatically. Moreover, the BNCNF as a flexible framework can remit the volumetric change of the sulfur cathode, physically retard the migration of LiPSs and chemically adsorb to the LiPSs. Attributing to the synergistic effect of TiO-TiO2 nanoparticle and BNCNF membrane, the LiS batteries with the novel composite interlayer (named as TiO-TiO2/BNCNF) exhibit outstanding cycling stability and high discharge capacity, especially at high current density. With the sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2), the cell with the TiO-TiO2/BNCNF interlayer delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1014.7 mA h g(-1) with a decay rate of 0.092% over 400 cycles at 0.5C, and also possesses excellent initial discharge capacity of 650.0 mA h g(-1) with a decay rate of 0.068% over 120 cycles even at 2.0C.

The Li-ion/sulfur batteries, which use Li2S as the cathode and can be coupled with different anodes (e.g., Si or Sn), can eliminate the safety issues related to lithium metal. To improve the performance of Li2S cathode for Li-ion/sulfur batteries, CoS2-decorated hollow carbon spheres (HCS) are first explored as a conductive matrix for the Li2S cathode. Hollow carbon spheres (HCS) possesses a strong tendency to physically absorb and trap high-order lithium polysulfides, while the CoS2 can chemically bond with low-order lithium polysulfides. Moreover, CoS2 has a catalytic effect that can reduce the energy barrier in the first charge. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction has clarified the catalytic mechanism of CoS2 toward barrier reduction. CoS2 can boost the electrochemical reactions from Li2S to polysulfide and act as a redox mediator, lowering the overpotential of Li2S in the first charge process, resulting in less electrolyte decomposition, stable cycling performance, and higher capacity. The data show that CoS2-decorated hollow carbon spheres have a higher initial specific capacity and better capacity retention, with specific capacity of 831 mA h g(-1) and capacity retention of 79.5% after 100 cycles, which is much better than the performance of hollow carbon spheres (Li2S-HCS) alone. The full cell core-shell Si@C parallel to Li2S-HCS/CoS2 shows a specific capacity of 650 mA h g(-1) and a capacity retention of 65% after 50 cycles at an average voltage of 1.6 V with low electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) and anode to cathode (A/C) ratio.

The resultant HCSs were then spread at the surface of salt water and submitted to a solar simulator in a special ventilated chamber. The presence of HCSs floating at the surface of water was shown to increase significantly the evaporation rate compared to an HCS-free reference. The effect of carbon precursor, pyrolysis temperature, size and presence of metal was investigated and discussed. The best performances were obtained with nickel-loaded HCSs treated at 1500 degrees C, leading to a water evaporation rate increased by 70% with respect to the reference. These performances were discussed in terms of floatability, the latter being related to wettability, composition and apparent density of the HCSs. A model was developed for separating the contributions of floatability and thermal conductivity, definitely demonstrating that the former was the key parameter explaining the performances of floating HCSs for evaporating water submitted to a radiant heat flow.

Smarter material and strategy for anchoring platinum with enhanced utilization efficiency are highly demanded. In this work, N-doped hollow carbon nanospheres are prepared targetedly from a metal-organic framework for in-situ platinum dispersion. Through a simple electrochemical method, platinum nanoparticles are successfully anchored on the surface of the carbon nanospheres decorated electrode, which exhibits exceptional HER performance in H2SO4 with low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope (33 mV decade(-1)), high current density (overpotentials of 40 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and high stability (4000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles and total 30 h of high current density (10, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2)) chronoamperometric electrolysis). The superior electrocatalytic activity and durability can be attributed to the facilitated electron transport and synergistic effects between platinum and carbon nanospheres. This work provides an insight into the development of efficient support materials from MOFs to design efficient platinum-based electrocatalysts for future water splitting.

For light polarization parallel and perpendicular, the dielectric function, absorption spectrum, reflectivity, refractive index, conductivity, and energy loss function of the systems have been calculated. Results indicate that the Zr adsorption system is a direct bandgap semiconductor. The adsorption system is transparent in the range of 7-9 eV under parallel polarization. In the visible range, the peaks of the absorption spectrum of the system are redshifted. Thus the Zr adsorption system has higher peak intensity in the Near-Infrared frequency. Under the perpendicular polarization, the reflectivity of the Zr adsorption system exhibits a reduced peak intensity and a new peak near 4 eV. We hope that our study would provide a constructive reference for applications of optoelectronic devices.

Two instruments are accommodated on Tan-Sat: the high resolution hyperspectral sensor for carbon observation grating spectrometer (HRHS-GS) and the cloud and aerosol polarimetric imager (CAPI). HRHS-GS will provide the space-based measurements of CO2 on a scale and with the accuracy and precision to quantify terrestrial sources and sinks of CO2. CAPI is used to identify the contamination by optically thick clouds and to minimize the impact of scattering by aerosol. These two instruments work together to collect global column CO2 concentrations with correction for cloud and aerosol contamination. The instrument design of HRHS-GS is presented. Ocean reflectivity and the incident radiation of the instrument for transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations in glint mode are discussed. The changes to glint mode operation are described. The spectral characteristics of HRHS-GS were determined through the laser-based spectral calibration. The onboard spectral calibration method based on spectrum matching is introduced.

However, fatal dendritic Li growth is the bottleneck of the development of Li anode. In this contribution, we reported a titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticle additive to guide Li deposition uniformly, hence dead Li and dendritic Li are effectively reduced. There are more nucleation sites on the surface of the electrode due to the stronger adsorption of Li ions on each facet of TiN, and TiN nanoparticles play the role of seeds of Li deposition. The half cells cycling in additive electrolyte exhibit an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 97.19% for 270 cycles on plane copper (Cu) electrode and an excellent high average CE of 99.01% for 300 cycles on three-dimensional (3D) carbon paper (CP) electrode at 1 mA/cm(2) and 1 mAh/cm(2). Li-S full cells equipped with such TiN nanoparticles additive electrolyte deliver great enhanced cycling and rate performance. This work provides a new insight to suppress Li dendrite and realizing high performance of Li metal batteries. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, O doped porous carbon materials (OPC) with a 3D hierarchical structure, consisting of 2-4 mu m carbon sheets decorated with macrospores of 0.2-0.4 mu m, was fabricated with MgO template. It is found that the increasing the carbonization temperature and the amount of MgO will make OPC rich in oxygen functional groups and defect sites. Electrochemical measures show that the OPC12-800 achieves reversible capacity (an initial discharge specific capacity of 1448.4 mAh g(-1) at current density of 0.1 C) and cycling performance (717.7 mAh g(-1) at 2 C over 200 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the hierarchical porous structure, abundant C-O/C=O and defects, which effectively adsorbs polysulfides and promote faster redox reaction of LiPSs. This study provides an alternative to improve the performance of carbon materials as host of Li-S batteries by regulating the types of oxygen-containing functional groups and defects on carbon surface.

A safe and efficient lithiated silicon-sulfur battery enabled by a bi-functional composite interlayer	ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS			English	Article						Lithiated silicon/sulfur battery; Prelithiation; Interlayer; Porous Li scaffold; Solid electrolyte	LITHIUM METAL ANODE; HIGH-CAPACITY; ION BATTERIES; FULL CELL; PRELITHIATION	Replacing lithium metal in a lithium-sulfur battery with lithiated silicon can enhance safety and reversibility while maintaining the high energy density. However, fabricating lithiated silicon, while protecting it against lithium polysulfides, is difficult. In this work, we design and prepare a protected lithium/carbon nanofiber composite interlayer for simultaneous lithiation and protection of the silicon anode. The interlayer is fabricated via two steps of reactions, first by reacting antimony trifluoride-modified carbon nanofibers with molten lithium, and then by coating it for a tightly anchored solid electrolyte layer on lithium. The interlayer can be directly inserted between a separator and a silicon anode during battery assembly to lithiate and protect the anode, which enables the stable operation of a lithiated silicon/sulfur battery of a practical loading (4.0 mg cm(-2) for both silicon and sulfur) at 2.5 mA cm(-2) for 200 cycles, with capacity retention up to 94%. This work demonstrates how we can achieve a durable full battery via a scalable structural design strategy, which could be extended for use in other types of (lithium, sodium, potassium)-ion/sulfur batteries.

However, low stability in water creates a barrier for its potential applications. In this study, graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) are adopted to modify the Cu-BTC. The influence of GO and RGO on the resulting BET surface area, pore diameter distribution, morphology and yield of the Cu-BTC are revealed. It is found that the adsorption abilities of the resulting composites for the polar and nonpolar gas molecules are closely related to the presence at surface of the functional groups of the used graphene samples, which provides a potential method to achieve selective adsorption. Furthermore, the preparation processes of the GO/Cu-BTC and RGO/Cu-BTC exert a significant effect on the performances of the resulting product, which is also studied in detail. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

An effective method of tuning conducting properties: First-principles studies on electronic structures of graphene nanomeshes	CARBON			English	Article							ANTIDOT LATTICES; BILAYER GRAPHENE; BANDGAP; LITHOGRAPHY	Based on detailed first-principles investigations of the hexagonal antidot patterned graphene nanomeshes, we have studied the mechanisms of the conducting property modification of graphene. The band-folding analysis shows that the (3n,3m) (n and m are integers) superlattice would have fourfold degeneracy at Gamma point. An effective method by removing this fourfold degeneracy, such as regularly arranging antidots to make the (3n,3m) nanomesh, is proposed to open a sizable bandgap no matter whether the sublattice equivalence keeps or not. In the nanomeshes patterned with the magnetic antidots, the antiferromagnetic coupling adds a quantum parameter to break the sublattice equivalence, resulting in the bandgap opening at the twofold degenerate K (K') point. Our studies also show that the gap width could be tuned by controlling the antidot density. These results could facilitate the fascinating applications of graphene in the next-generation nanoelectronics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Xiu, S. L.; Zheng, M.

In this study, a novel biomimetic sensor was constructed for sweet taste detection by compositing graphene oxide, hemin, and 3-aminophenylboronic acid (APBA). First, optimal fabrication of the sensor was investigated by comparing different composition proportions of graphene oxide and APBA functionalized hemin in saccharide measurements. Then, typical substances of natural sugars (i.e., glucose and fructose) and artificial sweeteners (i.e., saccharin and aspartame) were measured with the sensor through optical absorption spectroscopy. The spectra displayed apparent but different absorbance changes in the presence of those two kinds of saccharides, showing different sensing mechanisms of the biomimetic sensor for sugars and sweeteners like sweet receptors. Finally, dose-dependent and specific responses of the sensor were observed by comparing with other taste substances. The results suggested that the sensor can detect and distinguish natural sugars and artificial sweeteners in a biomimetic way. The research provided a low-cost, long-lifetime, and efficient approach for sweet taste detection, indicating its promising applications in fields such as food and beverage analysis.

While, its high chemical activity to continuously react with electrolytes causing low coulombic efficiency and formation of lithium dendrites leading safety concern limits practical applications. To conquer these challenges, amorphous Li3PO4 thin films with thickness of 0-200 nm are directly coated on the surface of Li metal foil via magnetron sputtering. The as-prepared Li3PO4 has almost insulated property with electronic conductivity of 1.4 x 10(-10) S/cm and ionic conductivity of 2.8 x 10(-8) S/cm. The conformal coating layer Li3PO4 can successfully suppress the lithium dendrites growth and improve its life span. The remarkable improvements of the Li3PO4-coated Li electrodes are mainly attributed to high chemical stability as well as amorphous nature of Li3PO4, which leads layer-by-layer growth Li film rather than islands form dendrites.

Herein, we have successfully prepared phosphorus doped Fe3O4 nanoflowers on three-dimensional porous graphene (denoted as P-Fe3O4@3DG) via a simple hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphating reaction. The P-Fe3O4@3DG hybrid composite not only demonstrates superior performance for HER in 1.0 M KOH with low overpotential (123 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)), small Tafel slope (65 mV/dec), and outstanding durability exceeding 50 h, but also exhibits satisfying performances under neutral and acidic medium as well. The 3D graphene foam with large porosity, high conductivity, and robust skeleton conduces to more active sites, and faster electron and ion transportation. The phosphorus dopant provides low Gibbs free energy and ability of binging H+. The synergistic effect of 3DG substrate and P-Fe3O4 active material both accelerates the catalytic activity of Fe-based hybrid composite for HER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Successful detection of decane in human breath has vast prospects for early lung cancer diagnosis. In this paper, a novel detecting device based on a filter surface acoustic wave (SAW) gas sensor is presented. SAW sensors coated with a thin oxidized graphene film were used to detect decane in parts per million (ppm) concentrations. Control and signal detection circuits were designed using a vector network analyzer with a detection resolution of insertion loss down to 0.0001 dB. The results showed that the SAW sensor could respond quickly with great sensitivity when exposed to 0.2 ppm decane. This device shows tremendous potential in medical diagnosis and environmental assessment.

The unique structure constructed by VAGN endows the electrode with high specific capacitance up to 670 F g(-1). Additionally we assembled two pieces of the electrode to make a highly flexible all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor. This device demonstrates a high capacitance of 562 F g(-1), high energy density of 50 W h kg(-1), high power density of 64 kW kg(-1) and good stability after 10 000 cycles.

However, developing high-performance sulfur cathodes has been proven difficult due to low electronic and ionic conductivities and large volume change of sulfur during charge and discharge. Here, we reported an approach to synthesize sulfur cathodes with a mixed electronic and ionic conductivity by infiltrating a solution consisting of Li3PS4 (LPS) solid electrolyte and S active material into a mesoporous carbon (CMK-3). This approach leads to a uniform dispersion of amorphous Li3PS7 (L3PS) catholyte in an electronically conductive carbon matrix, enabling high and balanced electronic/ionic conductivities in the cathode composite. The inherent porous structure of CMK-3 also helps to accommodate the strain/stress generated during the expansion and shrinkage of the active material. In sulfide-based all-solid-state batteries with Li metal as the anode, this cathode composite delivered a high capacity of 1025 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 60 degrees C at 1/8C. This work highlights the important role of high and balanced electronic and ionic conductivities in developing high-performance sulfur cathodes for ASSLSBs.

GO can adsorb single-stranded DNA probes and quench its fluorescence. DSN was employed to enhance the sensitivity of the detecting system considering its prominent ability of fluorescence signal amplification effect. Moreover, the method enables to capture miR-185 sensitively in aqueous solution with a detection limit of 476 pM in the range 0-100 nM and R-2 = 0.989. Since miR-185 has been identified as a prognostic biomarker to forecast the course of survival and relapse in gastric cancer (GC), quantitative detection of miR-185 features in developing personalized strategies for GC treatment. In this study, a highly sensitive method for miR-185 detection was rationally designed with the characteristic of fluorescent signal amplification and it was based on constructing graphene oxide sensor and utilizing duplex specific nuclease (DSN). In detail, the cleavage of many DNA signal probes was successfully triggered by the miR-185 target which contributed to the target-recycling mechanism. The protocol exhibited a prominent ability to analyze miR-185 in solution, and it can detect miR-185 at different concentrations as low as 476 pM with a linear range of 0-50 nM. Moreover, this method has gained its prominence in distinguishing the target miRNA from various sequences with one to three base mismatches or other miRNAs. Taken together, it presented the prominent potential to be a candidate tool in the field of clinical diagnosis considering its precise and efficient ability to detect miR-185.

Deposition experiments were conducted by decomposing methane in a thermogravimetric analyzer at 800 degrees C, with both NiO or YSZ powders and small chips of an unused anode-supported SOFC button cell used separately as bed materials. The carbon tended to deposit on the Ni surfaces with the NiO or YSZ powders, while with the anode chips, the deposited carbon formed particles comparable in size to the Ni or YSZ particles with little carbon deposited near the electrolyte where the electrochemical reactions occur. Thus, the results infer that the deposited carbon has little opportunity to participate in the electrochemical reactions. A two-dimensional isothermal model was then developed to examine the influence of the deposited carbon on the cell performance. The results show the diffusion coefficient of CO has the largest influence, followed by the gasifying reactivity and the electrochemical reactivity of the carbon. Finally, a short deposition time and a high methane concentration are favored to improve the performance of deposited carbon fuel cells. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We first analytically derive the general formula of the lattice vibration frequency, and then numerically discuss the effect of the defects on the PDOS. Our results suggest that the vacancy defects will induce the sawtooth-like oscillation of the PDOS and the specific oscillation patterns depend on the concentration and the spatial distribution of the vacancies. In addition, it is verified that the vacancy defects will cause the increase of the heat capacity because of the vacancy-induced low-frequency resonant peak. Moreover, the influences of the vacancies on the free energy and the entropy are investigated.

The coral-like structured AB provides huge micropores and vast specific surface area for bonding sulfur, and supplies a 3D conductive matrix for enhancing the conductivity of composite. A plenty of ion channels served by PPY layer can promote the Li+ migration and alleviate the electrode polarization. In addition, the dissolution and diffusion of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte can be restrained by PPY coating. The volume variation of cathode in the charge-discharge process can be relieved by the high elastic PPY layer combined with the 3D matrix of AB.

However, the current exfoliation technology still needs to be improved for large-scale production. Here, a simple, universal two-step strategy, "ball-milling insertion and pure-water exfoliation", is proposed to produce high quality ultrathin amorphous 2D nanosheets with a thickness of similar to 1 nm. Such a method is available not only for a single layered material, but is extendable to its composites. The resulting amorphous multiphase heterostructure nanosheets with multiple interfaces are employed for fabricating multifunctional separators in lithium-sulfur batteries, which show an improved cycling stability at a high current of 1 A g(-1) and a high rate capability, due to an interfacial synergetic effect. Besides, the modified separators exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and thermal conductivity.

Nitrogen-doped graphene was doped into the Fe-N/C catalyst during the process of synthesis. By the synergistic reaction between graphene and Fe-N/C, the catalytic activity and stability of catalyst were improved. XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS were used to character the physical structure, morphology and chemical composite of catalysts. The results show that the catalyst has the optimal oxyen reductive reaction(ORR) activity when the mass ratio of grapheme to BP2000 is 1 4 and the heat treatment temperature is 800 degrees C. The accelerated aging test(AAT) test shows that catalyst NG/Fe-N/C-25 is more stable than commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst in acidic medium. The total N content of NG/Fe-N/C-25 catalyst is about 5.17%, and the content of graphite nitrogen and pyridine nitrogen are about 44.35% and 32.66%, respectively. These high content of graphitic nitrogen and pyridine nitrogen may result in the high ORR activity and stability.

In this work, a novel 2D nitrogen-containing carbon material, C5N, is theoretically designed through structure changes in atomic scale, that is, introducing V-C-V-N bivacancy defects along lines in perfect C3N monolayer. C5N monolayer is verified to be chemically, mechanically, dynamically, and thermodynamically stable based on cohesive energy, elastic constants, phonon spectrum, and molecular dynamics calculations. C5N is determined to be metallic which is an important property for battery electrode. Moreover, the anchoring performance of S-8 and Li2Sn (n = 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8) on C5N monolayer and the anchoring mechanisms are explored. The adsorption energies are calculated to be -0.24, -1.20, -1.10, -1.06, -1.63, and -1.59 eV for S-8, Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4, Li2S2, and Li2S, respectively. The anchoring effect of Li2Sn on C5N monolayer originates from the charge transfer between lithium polysulfides and C5N surface. These results reveal that C5N monolayer is a promising host material for polysulfides in Li-S batteries. Our calculations illustrate the design of nanostructures and facilitate the application of carbon-based 2D materials in environment and energy.

Previous work has shown that these GO sheets have different electrophoretic properties and can be separated via capillary electrophoresis according to their surface charge U. Zhao et al., Anal. Chem. 83 (2011) 9100-9106). Herein, the GO sheets were separated by density gradient centrifugation to achieve preparation of bulk GO materials. GO sheets were separated by their thicknesses and the as-obtained sheets were characterized for their spectroscopic, electronic and electrochemical properties. After treated by hydrazine, GO was derivatized with N element and become active toward oxygen reduction reaction. The thin layer GO sheets incorporated with more hydrazine and the atomic ratio of N/C was higher than thick layer GO sheets. This work suggested that the physicochemical properties of GO sheets were N of layer related and it is necessary to separate GO sheets to prepare suitable materials for device fabrication or catalysts use.

However, improvements are often limited especially under high sulfur loading. Herein, we prepare molybdenum carbide nanostructures and investigate their potential as the cathode electrocatalyst for lithium-polysulfide batteries. The product is prepared by the self-polymerization of dopamine in the presence of Mo7O246- ions, followed by high-temperature carburization. It features ultrasmall alpha-MoC1-x nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on a hierarchical carbonaceous support. Polysulfide adsorption experiments and electrochemical measurements show that this material has a strong surface affinity toward polysulfides, and can greatly enhance their conversion rate, in particular the Li2S4 <-> Li2S2/Li2S conversion. When assessed as the cathode electrocatalyst, it enables lithium-polysulfide batteries with large specific capacity (up to 1400 mA h g(-1)), impressive rate capability (800 mA h g(-1) at 3200 mA g(-1)) and excellent cycling stability even at high sulfur loading.

Trends in the Development of Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries	INORGANIC MATERIALS			English	Article						room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery; rechargeable electrochemical cells; cathode material; anode material; electrolytes; cation-exchange membrane; selectivity	SOLID POLYMER ELECTROLYTES; EXCHANGE MEMBRANES; ENERGY-STORAGE; NA/S BATTERIES; LITHIUM-ION; RENEWABLE ENERGY; LAYER DEPOSITION; CELL CHEMISTRY; LI-S; CARBON	This review examines research reported in the past decade in the field of the fabrication of batteries based on the sodium-sulfur system, capable of operating at an ambient temperature (room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries). Such batteries differ from currently widespread lithium-ion or lithium-sulfur analogs in that their starting materials are cheaper and more readily available. One of the key problems to be resolved on the way to room-temperature Na-S batteries with high energy density and long-term cycling stability is transport of cell reaction products (sodium polysulfides) to the opposite electrode, which leads to an appreciable battery self-discharge and loss of the active material as a result of redox reactions that are not accompanied by energy generation. This review is aimed at examining approaches to improving the electrochemical performance of the room-temperature Na-S batteries. Particular attention is paid to potential applications of cation-exchange materials capable of suppressing polysulfide anion transport, with a high sodium cation transport rate retained.

Carbon System Simulation in the Pearl River Estuary, China: Mass Fluxes and Transformations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Carbon cycle; Carbon fixation; Estuary; Modeling	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; INORGANIC CARBON; PARTICULATE MATERIALS; COASTAL OCEAN; GAS-EXCHANGE; VARIABILITY; CO2; NUTRIENTS; WATER; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY	A carbon cycle model is built to describe the behavior of carbon materials in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), China. The distributions and transformations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC) are simulated in the water column and sediment for the year 2006. The terrestrial carbon input is the dominant factor that determines the seasonal variation of carbon, while physical and biochemical processes contribute to the spatial-temporal circulation of carbon. The simulation results reveal that the PRE acts as a net source for atmospheric CO2 throughout the year, and it buffers the export of DIC from the river and sediment to the adjacent system via the DIC consumption by primary production. As a consequence of biochemical processes, the PRE exports more organic carbon to the sediment and adjacent marine ecosystems than the amount that it receives from upstream river reaches. POC burial in sediment and refractory DOC export to the adjacent marine ecosystems are the main carbon fixation pathways in the PRE. The total amount of carbon fixation in PRE is estimated 6.92 x 10(10) mol C year(-1). Carbon fixation analysis shows that (1) 20.4% of the POC deposited into sediment is fixed through burial, while the remaining continues to participate in the circulation of carbon materials, and (2) the combined effects of river discharge and monsoon dominate the amount and direction of refractory DOC exports. Plain Language Summary Carbon cycle in estuaries is an important part of the global carbon cycle. Due to the intensive human impact and complicated biogeochemical processes, there exist great uncertainties in estimating carbon fixation and difficulties in illustrating the entire carbon cycle in estuaries. In this study, we chose the Pearl River Estuary as the study area and used a carbon cycle model to simulate the distribution and transformation of carbon materials. Our study found that the carbon cycle in the PRE is very active. Even though CO2 undergoes continuous evasion from the sea surface to the atmosphere, the PRE fixes 6.92 x 10(10) mol C year(-1) via particulate organic carbon burial into deep sediment and refractory dissolved organic carbon export to adjacent marine systems. In different seasons, with river discharge and monsoon changes, carbon fixation ability and the direction of carbon export flux vary as well. Key Points The entire carbon system of Pearl River Estuary is simulated in this study Carbon fixation pathways are estimated, and carbon fixation ability is simulated in this study	[Liang, B.; Hu, J.

In this paper, a simple and efficient approach is proposed to overcome this problem such that the exact boundary condition can be applied and the surface current density on PPGS can be obtained accurately. Here, the PPGS is modeled as a conductive surface and only its conductivity representation by the Fourier series is modified. The proposed method can be used easily for 1-D and 2-D periodic structures without the need to change the basic formulations of Fourier-based methods. Fast convergence and accuracy of the method will be demonstrated by computing the absorption of 1-D and 2-D PPGS. Moreover, the proposed method is utilized to design a wideband tunable wide-angle polarizer consisting of two-parallel PPGS separated by a 0.5-mu m layer of SiO2. The transmittance of the structure exceeds 95% from microwaves up to 2 THz.

Here, we first demonstrate an aptamer-based frequency shift Raman approach via sensing of graphene. This biosensor allows the rapid, sensitive, and label-free detection of the acknowledged protein cancer biomarker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Monolayer graphene is employed as the Raman substrate, which is highly sensitive to its electronic structure and interface properties. The PSA aptamer can be adsorbed strongly on the surface of substrates through pi-pi stacking interactions. The vibrational frequency of the G peak of graphene shifted upon the specific binding between the PSA and its aptamer. The corresponding frequency shifts of the G peak are directly correlated with PSA concentrations. The limit of detection is as low as 0.01 ng/mL, with a wide linear range from 0.05 ng/mL to 25 ng/mL. The analytic samples can be detected directly without any extensive preparation and label process. The whole detection is completed in only 30 min. Furthermore, excellent recoveries are acquired to validate the feasibility of this assay in human serum samples. The proposed technology could provide a selective, versatile, and user-friendly strategy for the early detection of cancer biomarkers.

Herein, COF/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels synthesized by a hydrothermal approach are presented. The COFs grow in situ along the surface of the 2D graphene sheets, which are stacked in a 3D fashion, forming an ultralight aerogel with a hierarchical porous structure after freeze-drying, which can be compressed and expanded several times without breaking. The COF/rGO aerogels show excellent absorption capacity (uptake of >200g organic solvent/g aerogel), which can be used for removal of various organic liquids from water. Moreover, as active material of supercapacitor devices, the aerogel delivers a high capacitance of 269Fg(-1) at 0.5Ag(-1) and cycling stability over 5000 cycles. Macroscopic architectures of covalent organic frameworks (COF) allow to fully exploit their chemical functionality and porosity but achieving three-dimensional hierarchical porous COF architectures remains challenging. Here, the authors present a COF/reduced graphene oxide aerogel which is synthesized by growing COF during a hydrothermal process along the surface of graphene sheets.

Two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with uniform and controllable nanopores provide a promising strategy for fabricating ionic sieves to inhibit the shuttle effect. However, the insoluble nature of COFs made it difficult to fabricate compact and ordered membranes of COFs. Herein, we report a novel method for facilely anisotropic ordering of 2D COFs via depositing COFs onto graphene. The resulted double-layer membranes acting as ionic sieves impressively inhibit the shuttle effect and exhibit versatility to both organic sodium-ion batteries and Li-S batteries, leading to high cyclability.

The structural advantages of the iron-based metal-organic framework (MIL-88-Fe) as both a sacrificed template and a precursor are explored to prepare carbon-encapsulated ploy iron sulfide through solid-state chemical sulfurizing. The resulting core-shell nanorods consisting of approximately 13% carbon and 87% Fe7S8 have a hierarchically porous structure and a very high specific surface area of 277 m(2) g(-1). When tested for use in fabrication of a redox conversion-type lithium-ion battery, this composite material has demonstrated high lithium-ion storage capacity at 1148 mA h g(-1) under the current rate of 500 mA g(-1) for 170 cycles and an impressive rate-retention capability at 657 mA h g(-1) with a current density of 2000 mA On the basis of systematic structural analysis and microscopic mapping, we discuss the charge-discharge mechanisms and the crucial factors associated with the stability and structural changes upon charge-discharge cycling.

However, uncontrolled dendrite growth during cycling has remained a big challenge, resulting in poor capacity retention and safety issue. Herein, an ultralight hollow 3D carbon skeleton was fabricated from soybean oil through a facile chemical vapor deposition method, which was subsequently coated with copper oxide layer to improving Li wettability. Molten Li can be infused into the 3D carbon host rapidly due to the interaction between copper oxide and liquid Li. The in situ formed Cu nanograins highly dispersing on the carbon skeleton play a key role in homogenizing Li nucleation. The hollow 3D structure of carbon skeleton can accommodate the volume variations of the electrode and regulate Li stripping/plating behavior, thus suppress the dendrite growth and dead Li formation e ffectively. As a result, the Li composite electrode presents high areal capacity and cycle stability in both symmetric cell and Li -S cell. This work provides an alternative strategy to develop high loading Li composite anodes.

Molecular structure and stability of dissolved lithium polysulfide species	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; SULFUR BATTERIES; GRAPHENE OXIDE; RADICAL-ANION; CARBON PAPER; BASIS-SET; PERFORMANCE; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM	The ability to predict the solubility and stability of lithium polysulfide is vital in realizing longer lasting lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein we report combined experimental and computational analyses to understand the dissolution mechanism of lithium polysulfide species in an aprotic solvent medium. Multi-uclear NMR, variable temperature ESR and sulfur K-edge XAS analyses reveal that the lithium exchange between polysulfide species and solvent molecules constitutes the first step in the dissolution process. Lithium exchange leads to de-lithiated polysulfide ions (S-n(2-)) which subsequently form highly reactive free radicals through dissociation reaction (S-n(2-) -> 2S(n/2)(center dot-)). The energy required for the dissociation and possible dimer formation reactions of the polysulfide species is analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) based calculations. Based on these findings, we discuss approaches to optimize the electrolyte in order to control the polysulfide solubility.

However, the fundamental redox and diffusion properties of polysulfides are still poorly understood. We try to fill this gap by performing an accurate impedance spectroscopy investigation using symmetrical cells consisting of two planar glassy carbon electrodes separated with catholyte-soaked separator. The catholyte contains a mixture of selected polysulfides with predetermined nominal concentrations. Impedance measurements reveal textbook shapes of spectra for most polysulfide compounds or their mixtures. This allows reliable and accurate determination of the rate constant (exchange current density) for a given redox reaction as well as the diffusion coefficient and diffusion length for the rate-determining polysulfide species. Further, it is confirmed that polysulfides tend to disproportionate with time, which significantly changes the chemistry and electrochemistry of the system. Two approaches are proposed for identification of the prevailing redox mechanism in the resulting mixtures. The values of kinetic and transport parameters obtained for different cases of interest are commented on in significant detail. The study provides a solid basis for better understanding of the complex processes in polysulfide mixtures.

More effort should be made to improve the specific capacity and achieve superior rate capability. Functional phosphorus and oxygen dual-doped graphene (PODG) is introduced as the anode for PIB, made by a thermal annealing method using triphenylphosphine and graphite oxide as precursors. It exhibits high specific capacity and ultra-long cycling stability, delivers a capacity of 474 mA h g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1) after 50 cycles and retains a capacity of 160 mA h g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1) after 600 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance of PODG is mainly due to the large interlayer spacing caused by phosphorus and oxygen dual-doping, which facilitates potassium-ion insertion and extraction. Furthermore, the ultrathin and wrinkled features structure leads to a continuous and efficient supply of vacancies and defects for potassium storage.

In this study, a novel peptide self-assembled biosensor was developed based on gold nanoparticles functionalized graphene oxide (GO) for specific detection of thrombin. Through sulfhydryl design, peptides containing thrombin cleavage sites could self-assemble with the nanocomposites of the graphene material and gold particles, which brought the biosensor unique optoelectronic properties and high biological sensitivity to trans duce bio-molecular interactions into optical signals. Spectroscopic measurements were carried out in the presence of thrombin to observe an increase of the absorption peak at similar to 528 nm anda decrease of the absorbance at wavelength larger than 600 nm. The biosensor showed a linear dose-dependence and stable response to thrombin. And with a 528-680 nm absorbance ratio as the sensitive detection parameter, the self-assembled biosensor exhibited high sensitivity and specificity for the thrombin detection. Thus, it revealed convenient and sensitive detection abilities for protease of thrombin, indicating a promising prospect for other related proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases to cancer related diseases.

Transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have shown great potential in lithium/sodium ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs), however, they still face the critical issues of poor electrical conductivity, sluggish ion diffusion, huge volume expansion and agglomeration of highly reactive nano-metal products. Herein, we deliberately design a multiple-scale nanostructured and flexible anode by a facile one-step sulfidation strategy, in which ultrafine metal sulfide nanocrystals are isolated and protected by porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (PNC) and then encapsulated into three-dimensional graphene microsheets (3DG). It can effectively eliminate the above issues of TMSs, which makes them a very promising candidate for both LIBs and SIBs for the first time. Thus, the resultant FeS2/PNC@3DG anode delivers ultrahigh reversible capacities (1208 mA h g(-1) for LIBs and 597 mA h g(-1) for SIBs at 0.2 A g(-1)), excellent rate capabilities (829 mA h g(-1) for LIBs and 316 mA h g(-1) for SIBs at 5 A g(-1)), and superior long-term cycling performance with a capacity retention of 94.2% for LIBs and 85.2% for SIBs, which has rarely been achieved in previously reported various anodes. Moreover, its highly efficient Li+/Na+ storage mechanisms are systematically investigated by reaction kinetics analysis and density functional theory calculations, which further provide important insights into the development of high-performance energy storage materials.

J	Su, WL; Zou, J; Li, S; Sun, L				Su, Wuli; Zou, Jie; Li, Shuai; Sun, Lan			Mechanical properties of low-pressure sintered WC-6Co cemented carbide doped with graphene oxide/alumina composite particles	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Cemented carbide; Graphene oxide; Nano alumina; Low pressure sintering; Strengthening and toughening	MULTILAYER GRAPHENE; STRENGTH	The mechanical properties of WC-6Co cemented carbides with different contents of graphene oxide (GO)/nanoalumina (Al2O3) composite particles were investigated. The results showed that some of the GO/Al2O3 composite particles were tightly wrapped in WC grains through boundary deformation, but some of them existed in the cobalt phase, which gradually decreased the cobalt phase lattice constant and caused different degrees of grain refinement. When the content was 0.05 wt%, the cobalt phase dissolved more W; thus, the solid solution strengthening effect was improved. In addition, the superior dispersion of the composite particles aided in particle refinement. The relative alloy density increased as the GO/Al2O3 composite particle content increased. The mechanical properties first increased and then decreased with increasing additive amounts. When the content was 0.05 wt%, the alloy had the best performance. The hardness was 2021 HV30, the strength was 2480.4 MPa, and the toughness was 11.5 MPa.m(1/2).

Reticulated porous ceramics have been fabricated for several decades. However, insufficient data exists regarding the radar-absorption properties of reticulated porous ceramics. Therefore, the authors investigated the feasibility of using reticulated porous ceramics, prepared using alumina, as a platform for a radar-absorbing coating-material, such as carbon. The experimental data were used to determine whether carbon-coated reticulated porous alumina could be effectively prepared while maintaining an acceptable compressive strength by controlling the processing conditions. The structural properties and radar-absorption properties of the carbon coated reticulated porous alumina material were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury porosimetry, and a network analyzer. The compressive strengths of the reticulated porous alumina specimens could be tailored by controlling the sintering temperature and the pore density of the polyurethane foams. The reflection loss of the reticulated porous alumina specimen with a thickness of 18.40 mm, coated with a carbon slurry with a carbon content of 10 wt%, was calculated as approaching -40 dB at 10.0 GHz.

Here, gold nanoparticles on graphene oxide substrate were synthesized as sensitive nanoprobes for rapid L-cysteine detection. The smartphone-based system with multimode analysis of red-green-blue (RGB), hue-saturation-value (HSV), hue-saturation-lightness (HSL), and cyan-magenta-yellow-black (CMYK), were proposed for the investigation of interactions between the nanoprobes and L-cysteine. Then, optical absorption spectra were further examined to confirm the concentration characteristics of L-cysteine. Results suggested that gold nanoparticles on graphene oxide substrate had satisfying linearity and stability in dose-dependent responses to L-cysteine detection in the multimode analysis with the limit of detection at 0.06 mu M. Therefore, the smartphone-based nanoprobes system not only equipped with a high resolution camera and a powerful processor, but also was a fully automated device without additional label or complex detection. These features make it to be a convenient and efficient analysis platform for multiple fields, such as clinical application, industrial quality control, environment monitoring, and food assessment.

Hereby, electrochemically stable Zn anode is successfully designed by manipulating nucleation process through the introduction of hydrophilic graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Notably, the enhanced binding effect of GQDs with Zn2+ is aroused from the lower electronegativity of GQDs, which is conducive to accelerating uniform Zn deposition, resulting in the robust Zn anode without dendrites. Concomitantly, interfacial hydrogen bonds are excited by the GQDs with oxygen-containing groups, which is beneficial for mitigating water-induced side reaction and improving Zn ion reaction kinetics. Greatly, polarization voltage of symmetric cells is decreased from 80 to 50 mV at 0.8 mA cm-2, presenting a prolonged lifespan of 2200 h. As a result, the assembled ZIBs with vanadium cathode exhibit superior performance with capacity of 164.3 mAh g-1 after 600 cycles at 1 A g-1. Given this, this elaborate work might inaugurate a potential avenue for rationally tuning the electrode/electrolyte interface evolution towards advanced aqueous batteries.

Herein, inspired by the catalytic activities of ribose nucleic acid, using ribonucleosides as precursors including adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and uridine, respectively, four carbonic aggregates, namely, carbon dots (A-CDs, G-CDs, C-CDs, and U-CDs) to mimic artificial enzymes are synthesized. All the CDs show a planar graphene-like structure and thus can intercalatively bind with DNA double helix. Different from the other three CDs, the uridine-derived U-CDs exhibit unique catalytic property, which can mediate the topological transformation of DNA from supercoiled to nicked open-circular conformation. U-CDs can catalyze oxidation of O-2 to generate singlet oxygen O-1(2) via a Haber-Weiss reaction, and consequently mediate oxidative cleavage of phosphate backbone in DNA and release the torsional energy stored in supercoiled DNA. Explorations reveal that the unique highly active oxygenated species, namely, quinone groups that are on the edge of U-CDs, play a key role in the catalytic production of O-1(2). This work represents a new insight that using natural biomolecules in living systems as precursors can create new species beyond life.

Hence, an epoxy, graphene oxide, and paraffin wax composite (GPEP@PW) with a network-like sandwich structure was prepared by a four-step method (template method-vacuum impregnation-de-template-vacuum impregnation). Due to sensitive photothermal conversion of GO and excellent ability to control heat (absorption and release) of paraffin wax, GPEP@PW can respond to near-infrared light to realize the real-time conversion of friction coefficient (0.052 and 0.062), while the wear rate was reduced by two orders of magnitude rate (10(-4) to 10(-6) mm(3)/N.m). The light response behavior of tribology under different near-infrared intensities was studied. This strategy is simple and versatile, providing a new idea for the design and preparation of light stimulus-responsive materials to achieve smart tribological properties.

Improving thermoacoustic efficiency of graphene speakers is a goal for optimal design. In this work, we first modified the existing TA model with respect to small thermal wavelengths, and then built an acoustic platform for model validation. Additionally, sensitivity analyses for influential factors on thermoacoustic efficiency were performed, including the thickness of multilayered graphene films, the thermal effusivity of substrates, and the characteristics of inserted gases. The higher sensitivity coefficients result in the stronger effects on thermoacoustic efficiency. We find that the thickness (5 nm-15 nm) of graphene films plays a trivial role in efficiency, resulting in the sensitivity coefficient less than 0.02. The substrate thermal effusivity, however, has significant effects on efficiency, with the sensitivity coefficient around 1.7. Moreover, substrates with a lower thermal effusivity show better acoustic performances. For influences of ambient gases, the sensitivity coefficients of density rho(g), thermal conductivity kappa(g), and specific heat c(p,g) are 2.7, 0.98, and 0.8, respectively. Furthermore, large magnitudes of both rho(g) and kappa(g) lead to a higher efficiency and the sound pressure level generated by graphene films is approximately proportional to the inverse of c(p,g). These findings can refer to the optimal design for graphene thermoacoustic speakers. Published by AIP Publishing.

However, traditional powdery photocatalytic materials suffer from drawbacks, including difficult separation and weak durability, which do not conform to the practical demand. Herein, we developed a simple dipping-pyrolysis route to fabricate a novel 3D structure photocatalytic microreactor, in which ZIF-8-derived hollow ZnO nanocages are uniformly and firmly distributed throughout the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-coated carbon sponge frameworks. The obtained carbon network based-porous ZnO bulky photocatalysts exhibit excellent adsorption and photocatalytic degradation performance for organic pollutant, as well as high solar hydrogen production activity. With robust structure, good maneuverability, and convenient recyclability, these monolithic microdevices show a promising prospect toward industrial photocatalytic applications in sustainable environmental remediation and renewable energy generation. Furthermore, our work also demonstrates a versatile synthetic strategy that can be extended to the design of a broad series of porous functional metal oxide/carbon foam bulk composites with high photocatalytic performance and general adaptability.

It is found that the elemental selenium was dispersed inside the pores of BPC based on the analyses. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Se-BPC composite has a large reversible capacity and high rate performance as cathode materials. The Se-BPC (45.1 wt.% Se) composite displays an initial discharge capacity of 552 mAh g(-1) and a reversible discharge capacity of 264 mAh g(-1) after 80 cycles at 1 C charge/discharge rate. In particular, the Se-BPC composite presents a durable cycling performance at high rate of 2 C. These outstanding electrochemical features of Se-BPC composite cathode should be attributed to the uniform BPC with high surface area and bimodal porous structure. The bimodal potous carbon would be a promising carbon matrix to develop high performance lithium-selenium batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The morphology and surface properties of conductive CB were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Special pore structures, as well as surface chemical functional groups, endow CB with excellent catalytic and adsorption properties. Some parameters affecting electrical analysis performance were investigated systematically including deposition time and potential, pH value of solution, volume of suspension, amount of Bi(III) and Nafion solution. CB-Nafion-glassy carbon electrode sensor linear responseranges from 6 to 1000nM for selective and simultaneous determination. The detection limits were calculated to be 8nM (0.9 mu gl(-1)) for Cd(II) and 5nM (1.0 mu gI(-1)) for Pb(lI) (S/N = 3) for the electrocatalytic determination under optimized conditions. The method was successfully used to the determination of actual samples and good recovery was achieved from different spiked samples. Low detection limits and good stability of the modified electrode demonstrated a promising perspective for the detection of trace metal ions in practical application.

However, a deeply rechargeable Zn anode in lean electrolyte configuration is still lacking. Different from the solid-to-solid reaction mechanism in lithium-ion batteries, Zn anodes in alkaline electrolytes go through a solid-solute-solid mechanism (Zn-Zn(OH)(4)(2-)-ZnO), which introduces two problems. First, discharge product ZnO on the surface prevents further reaction of Zn underneath, which leads to low utilization of active material and poor rechargeability. Second, soluble intermediates change Zn anode morphology over cycling. In this work, an ion-sieving carbon nanoshell coated ZnO nanoparticle anode is reported, synthesized in a scalable way with controllable shell thickness, to solve the problems of passivation and dissolution simultaneously. The nanosized ZnO prevents passivation, while microporous carbon shell slows down Zn species dissolution. Under extremely harsh testing conditions (closed cell, lean electrolyte, no ZnO saturation), this Zn anode shows significantly improved performance compared to Zn foil and bare ZnO nanoparticles. The deeply rechargeable Zn anode reported is an important step toward practical high-energy rechargeable aqueous batteries (e.g., Zn-air batteries). And the ion-sieving nanoshell concept demonstrated is potentially beneficial to other electrodes such as sulfur cathode for Li-S batteries.

The resulting GQDs/Sb2WO6 was characterized by electron microscopy and optical measurements. The photocatalytic activity of GQDs/Sb2WO6 was investigated by degrading methyl orange (MO) under UV-light and visible-light irradiation. Compared with pure Sb2WO6, enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of GQDs/Sb2WO6 was achieved, and the degradation efficiency for MO was almost 100% within 3 h under UV-light irradiation and 71.4% within 3 h under visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation mechanism of GQDs/Sb2WO6 was illustrated by free radical and hole scavenging experiments, and the main active species were confirmed to be holes (h(+)) and superoxide anion radicals (O-2 center dot(-)). Moreover, the GQDs/Sb2WO6 composites exhibited high recyclability and stability and had potential application for decomposing other organic contaminants in water.

The sensor has employed the fluorescence "on/off" switching strategy in a single step in homogeneous solution. Compared to traditional detection methods, the strategy proposed here is simple, convenient, fast and sensitive. Furthermore, compared with the general aptamer-GO structure, this aptamer-GO-PEG structure is in possession of a better detection performance, which is largely attributed to the improvement of the biocompatibility and the adjustment of the adsorption capacity of GO by grafting the blocking agent PEG onto the surface of GO. Additionally, the improved biocompatibility of GO shows better stability in salt solutions and physiological solutions, which is more conducive to its practical application in foods. In this project, profenofos had been detected with the proposed strategy, and the limit of detection has been controlled to be 0.21 ng/mL. This aptasensing assay has been applied to determining profenofos in (spiked)tap water, cabbage and milk with the recovery values ranging from 93.1% to 108.5%, from 90.8% to 113.2% and from 105.9% to 114.2%, respectively.

By applying this binder -free, metal-current,collector-free FeS2@carbon fiber electrode, both the redox reaction and capacity decay mechanisms for the Li FeS2 system are revealed by changing the electrolyte (conventional carbonate electrolyte and a "solvent -in -salt" -type Li S battery electrolyte) and working voltage ranges (1.0-3.0 V and 1.5-3.0 V vs Li/Li+). The FeS2@carbon fiber electrode shows stable cycling performance in both the conventional' carbonate electrolyte and the solvent -in -salt -type Li S battery.electrolyte in the voltage range of 1.5-3.0 V. Electrochemical tests in the solvent -in -salt -type Li S battery electrolyte indicate that the Li-FeS2 system becomes a hybrid of the Li S cell and Li iron sulfide cell after the initial cycle. Based on the understanding on the capacity decay mechanisms, the cycling stability of the Li FeS2 system in the voltage range of 1.0-3.0 V is then significantly enhanced by coating the FeS2@carbon fiber electrode with a thin layer of Al2O3. The Al2O3-coated electrode demonstrates excellent cycling performance with high discharge energy densities at both the material level (similar to 300 Wh/kgFeS(2)) and the electrode level (similar to 000 Wh/kg-FeS2 electrode).

To mitigate these issues, for the first time, we report here an organic polymer filler, hydrolyzed polymaleic anhydride (HPMA), that can greatly suppress PEO crystallinity, enhance the ionic conductivity of PEO-based SPEs (1.13 x 10(-4)S cm(-1)at 35 degrees C) and support battery operation at 35 degrees C. PEO-HPMA SPEs feature high flexibility, incombustibility, wide electrochemical operating window and stability against lithium. The as-derived Li/PEO-HPMA/LiFePO(4)all-solid-state batteries show outstanding rate capability, high reversible capacity and long-term stability up to 1250 cycles. More impressively, the soft-packaged Li/PEO-HPMA/LiFePO(4)cells show high safety under various extreme conditions such as cutting and perforation.

Herein, a multifunctional phototheranostics based on a photosensitizer-assembled graphene/gold nanostar hybrid (GO/AuNS-PEG) was developed for cancer synergistic photodynamic (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) as well as effective photothermal imaging. The stable and biocompatible GO/AuNS-PEG composite displayed a high photothermal conversion efficiency due to the enhanced optical absorbance of both graphene and gold nanostars in the near-infrared (NIR) range. By tuning the absorption wavelength of GO/AuNS-PEG to that of Chlorin e6 (Ce6), GO/AuNS-PEG/Ce6 completely eliminated the EMT6 xenograft tumors by the tremendous synergistic anticancer efficiency of simultaneous PDT and PTT under a single NIR laser irradiation (660 nm) in vivo. The underlying mechanism may be the enhanced cytoplasmic uptake and accumulation of GO/AuNS-PEG/Ce6 and the subsequent photodestruction of the lysosomal membrane and mitochondria. Moreover, GO/AuNS-PEG/Ce6 exhibited negligible side-effects on the body and other organs. These results demonstrate that the graphene/gold nanostar nanoconstruct provides a versatile and reliable integrated platform for the photo-controlled cancer theragnostic applications. Statement of Significance This work demonstrated the application of graphene-Au Nanostars hybridized system (denoted as GO/AuNS-PEG) in single wavelength laser induced synergistic photodynamic (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) and effective cancer photothermal/fluorescence multimode imaging. GO/AuNS-PEG showed excellent biocompatibility and high dual-enhanced photothermal efficiency under the near-infrared laser irradiation that was very promise for deep tumor imaging. By combining with the photosensitizer Chlorin e6, both in vitro and in vivo data confirmed the efficient photoablation of the EMT6 tumors through the synergistic PDT and PTT effect under the activation of a single wavelength laser.

Unfortunately, uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrite triggers serious safety hazards, low Coulombic efficiency, and short cycling life, impeding the commercial application of lithium metal anode in the advanced energy storage technology, such as lithium-air and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, Chitosan oligosaccharide (CSO), an abundant bioderived material was employed to guide uniform lithium deposition and growth. CSO offers three features simultaneously, polar functional groups (-OH and -NH2), natural porous structure, and abundant sources. CSO with a large number of polar groups has strong interactions with Li ions, which could guide the Li ions to form uniform Li deposition. Moreover, the porous structure of CSO could serve as a Li host to accommodate the huge volume change during Li plating and stripping process. Additionally, CSO is a low-cost, abundant, and nontoxic bioderived material, which is suitable for large-scale production of the CSO-Li anode. The proposed strong interactions of CSO with Li ions were confirmed by density functional theory calculations. As expected, the CSO modified electrode demonstrates an outstanding average Coulombic efficiency of over 98% for 600 cycles at a current density of 2 mA cm(-2). And stable cycling performances were achieved in the CSO-Li/CSO-Li symmetrical cells. Moreover, when paired with the LiFePO4 cathode, Li4Ti5O12 anode, high-mass-loading LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode, and S cathode, the cells using the CSO-Li anodes show the higher capacities and better cycling stabilities compared with those of the cells using the bare U anodes.

In the SLG/YIG heterostructure, the Dirac cone electrons of graphene are found to be negatively spin polarized in parallel to the minority spins of YIG with a large polarization degree, without giving rise to significant changes in the pi band structure. Theoretical calculations reveal the electrostatic interfacial interactions providing a strong physical adhesion and the indirect exchange interaction causing the spin polarization of SLG at the interface with YIG. The Hall device of the SLG/YIG heterostructure exhibits a nonlinear Hall resistance attributable to the anomalous Hall effect, implying the extrinsic spin-orbit interactions as another manifestation of the proximity effect.

The DNA biosensor, which is locked by GO, is designed to contain two sensing modules that include recognition site for ATP and self-replication track that yields the nicking domain for Nt.BbvCI. By taking advantage of the different binding affinity of single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA and aptamer-target complex toward GO, the DNA biosensor could be efficiently released from GO in the presence of target with the help of a complementary DNA strand (CPDNA) that partially hybridizes to the DNA biosensor. Then, the polymerization/nicking enzyme synergetic isothermal amplification could be triggered, leading to the synthesis of massive DNA amplicons, thus achieving an enhanced sensitivity with a wide linear dynamic response range of four orders of magnitude and good selectivity. This biosensing strategy expands the applications of GO-DNA nanobiointerfaces in biological sensing, showing great potential in fundamental research and biomedical diagnosis.

Therefore, advanced energy storage systems must provide sufficient energy for the electric vehicles. Among many energy systems, Li-S batteries are the most suitable system for them due to their high specific capacity and energy density. However, the poor cycle stability is the main obstacle for the application into electric vehicles. Herein, mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers are prepared and used as advanced host materials for sulfur in the Li-S batteries. The mesoporous TiO2 nanofibers could adsorb the polysulfide and promote the transport or electronics during discharge and charge cycles. As a result, the MTO/S composites show excellent electrochemical performance.

The dissolution kinetics is considered as a function of the solid sulphur-solution interfacial area. The analysis yielded fast dissolution kinetics with a mass transfer coefficient of 2.3 x 10(-3) m s(-1) at 20 degrees C but low sulphur solubility of 0.058 S mol lt(-1), with the latter being a limiting factor in sulphur dissolution. In later stages, swelling of the solid sulphur region was also observed as a function of time from which the diffusion coefficient of the DOL:DME solution in the solid sulphur was determined. A novel model for the sulphur dissolution and electrolyte impregnation in a Li-S cathode in battery fabrication is presented taking into account the pore size distribution of the cathode host. A computer simulation was carried out and the model and the dissolution parameter values were validated by comparing the predictions with experimental data from in operando microscopy during the dissolution of sulphur and infiltration of the DOL:DME solution in a commercial sulphur-conductive carbon cathode.

In this work, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were electrostatically self-assembled with polypyrrole (PPy), and then electrochemically reduced GQDs (ERGQDs)/PPy hybrids were obtained via direct electrochemical reduction of the GQDs. The size and distribution of the PPy particles are closely correlated with the concentration of the pyrrole (Py) monomer. The obtained ERGQDs/PPy hybrids combine the advantages of electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) from ERGQDs and pseudo-capacitors from PPy, exhibiting high specific capacitance (418 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 ), good rate capability (75.8% capacitance retention at 10 A g -1 ) and high cyclic stability (86.0% capacitance retention after 10 0 0 cycles at 10 A g -1 ). These results indicate that the as-prepared ERGQDs/PPy hybrids might be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

High resolution transmission and scanning electronic microscopy showed the formation of a highly developed branched structure consisting of polypyrrole with uniform sulfur coating on its surface. Exclusion of heat-treatment in the composite preparation avoided the sulfur loss; the composite contained 65 wt% of sulfur. AC impedance spectroscopy data exhibited remarkable reduction in charge transfer resistance of the composite compared with pristine sulfur. This may be due to the high conductivity and large surface area of polypyrrole. This charge transfer enhancement led to the electrochemical performance improvement of the composite cathode, delivering first discharge capacity of 1320 mAh g(-1). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Conversion of Co Nanoparticles to CoS in Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Porous Carbon during Cycling Facilitates Na2S Reactivity in a Na-S Battery	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						sodium-sulfur batteries; cobalt nanoparticles; cobalt sulfide; porous carbon; energy storage	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; COUNTER ELECTRODE; THIN-FILMS; PERFORMANCE; SULFIDE; CO3O4; REDOX; FE; POLYSULFIDES	Room-temperature sodium-sulfur batteries have attracted wide interest due to their high energy density and high natural abundance. Polysulfide dissolution and irreversible Na2S conversion are challenges to achieving high battery performance. Herein, we utilize a metal-organic framework-derived Co-containing nitrogen-doped porous carbon (CoNC) as a catalytic sulfur cathode host. A concentrated sodium electrolyte based on sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, dimethoxyethane, and bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether is used to mitigate polysulfide dissolution. We tune the amount of Co present in the CoNC carbon host by acid washing. Significant improvement in reversible sulfur conversion and capacity retention is observed with a higher Co content in CoNC, with 600 mAh g(-1) and 77% capacity retention for CoNC and 261 mAh g(-1) and 56% capacity retention for acid-washed CoNC at cycle 50 at 80 mAh g(-1). Post-mortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and selected area electron diffraction suggest that CoS is formed during cycling in place of Co nanoparticles and CoN4 sites. Raman spectroscopy suggests that CoS exhibits a catalytic effect on the oxidation of Na2S. Our findings provide insights into understanding the role Co-based catalysts play in sulfur batteries.

A surfactant-free self-assembly approach between resorcinol/formaldehyde and silicon alkoxide has emerged as an important strategy to prepare MHCS. Extending such a strategy to other substituted phenols to produce heterogeneous-atomdoped MHCS remains a challenge due to the very different polymerization kinetics of various resins. Herein, we report an ethylenediamine-assisted strategy to control the cooperative self-assembly between a 3-aminophenol/formaldehyde resin and silica templates. Nitrogen-doped mesoporous invaginated carbon nanospheres (N-MICS) with an N content of 6.18 at %, high specific surface areas (up to 1118 m(2)g(-1)), large pore volumes (2.47 cm(3)g(-1)), and tunable mesopores (3.7-11.1 nm) have been prepared. When used as electrical double-layer supercapacitors, N-MICS show a high capacitance of 261 Fg(-1), an outstanding cycling stability (approximate to 94% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles), and a good rate performance.

The morphology, microstructure, and optical and electrical properties of the synthesized GNWs and IP silicon are investigated. It is shown that GNWs are distributed on the whole surface of the IP silicon and feature an outstanding electrode network. Moreover, in situ optical emission spectroscopy measurement is carried out to investigate the growth process and chemical reaction mechanism of GNWs under the plasma-based process. Due to the excellent light-trapping structure of IP silicon and outstanding electrode network of GNWs, the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of the pristine GNWs/IP Si solar cells can reach up to 4.05% via controlling the growth time of GNWs. A PCE of 7.2% can be achieved for the GNWs/IP Si solar cells by combining HNO3 p-doping treatment and spin-coating TiO2 as an antireflective layer. This work plays a vital role in the development of a simple and advanced process for the realization of high-efficiency graphene-based solar cells.

A rational design strategy for both materials compositions and structures has been proposed to meet these challenges. Herein, a triple-component composite derived from metal organic frameworks, comprising FeS2, nitrogen sulfur co-doped porous carbon, and reduced graphene oxide (FeS2@NSC/G), has been successfully synthesized. With the capacities contributions from different sodium storage routes (diffusion-controlled processes and surface capacitive processes) at varies rate conditions, it is aiming to make full use of each component in the electrode composite and their unique porous structures. Expected electrode properties have been achieved and related electrochemical could behaviors have also been investigated. The strategy would present a promising thought for composites design, which enhance high-rate electrochemical energy storage performances.

However, their morphology has been Limited to spherical shapes, with the carbon shell possibly Limiting access to their inner surfaces and utilization. Herein, we report a new type of hollow carbon material consisting of non-spherical, adamantane-shaped, hierarchically micro- and macro-porous, N-doped carbon nanoframes (mM-NCs) by exploiting selective etching and pseudomorphic thermal conversion of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). The mM-NCs showed superior performance as adsorbents for Large dye molecules and as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction relative to macropore-free N-doped carbons, which can be attributed to the presence of macropores, fully utilizable pore surfaces, and nitrogen species.

However, its practical application is still hindered by the poor cycling performance and serious safety issues for the consequence of dendritic Li. Herein, a dendrite-free Li/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid is proposed, which is fabricated by direct coating molten Li on CNTs, for Li-metal batteries. The favorable thermodynamic and kinetic conditions are the powerful force to drive the rapid lift upwards and infusion of molten Li into CNTs network, which is the key to form a uniform metallic layer in Li/CNTs hybrid. The obtained hybrid indicates super-stable functions even at an ultrahigh current density of 40 mA cm(-2) for 2000 cycles with a stripping/plating capacity of 2 mAh cm(-2) in symmetric cells. Subsequently, this hybrid also demonstrates a significantly decreased resistance, excellent cycling stability at high current density and flexibility in the full Li-S battery. This work provides valuable concepts in fabricating Li anodes toward Li-metal batteries and beyond for their high-level services.

Fabrication of graphene/polypyrrole nanotube/MnO2 nanotube composite and its supercapacitor application	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							GRAPHENE OXIDE; POLYPYRROLE; PERFORMANCE; POLYANILINE; MNO2; NANOCOMPOSITES; ELECTRODE; ANODE	A novel composite is fabricated through hybridizing graphene with polypyrrole (PPY) nanotube and manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanotube to comprehensively utilize the electrical double layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy are employed to characterize its structure. The SEM and TEM images illustrate that graphene/PPY nanotube/MnO2 nanotube composite (GPM) presents interconnected structure. The result of Raman analysis demonstrates the intimate interactions among PPY, graphene and MnO2. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques are used to measure the electrochemical properties. It is revealed that GPM presents excellent high-rate performance and its capacitance is as high as 469.5 Fg(-1) at a current density of 0.3 Ag-1, higher than that of PPY and chemically reduced graphene sheet as well as the materials reported in the literature. Furthermore, long-term charge-discharge cycle test confirms that the fabrication of GPM can effectively merge the merits of graphene, PPY and MnO2. Additionally, EIS analysis illustrates that the presence of conductive graphene as well as the intimate interactions among graphene, PPY and MnO2 lead to the good electrochemical stability.

Our results showed that GO nanocolloids treatment induced autophagosome accumulation in mESCs. In addition, we found that this effect was mediated by the blockade of autophagic flux rather than autophagic induction, as evidenced by the elevated autophagic substrate SQSTM1/p62 level and LC3B turn over. Moreover, our data further revealed that GO nanocolloids disrupted autophagic flux by impairing lysosomal function, including lysosomal alkalinization and lysosome membrane permeabilization. These results indicate that GO nanocolloids can block autophagic flux in mESCs via autophagy-lysosome dysfunction. Our findings may reveal the putative mechanism of GO nanocolloids-modulated autophagy and provide experimental evidence for the importance of future safety evaluation of nanomaterials.

In our study, we have synthesized nanoporous CoO nanowire clusters on three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene cloth (denoted as CoO-NW@GC) via a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent annealing process. The self-supported graphene cloth is provided with large surface area, high porosity and superior electric conductivity, which can greatly contribute to the fast electron and ion transport. Due to the nanoporous CoO nanowire clusters uniformly in situ depositing on the robust 3D skeleton of GC substrate, the CoO-NW@GC hybrid as anode for LIBs achieves 1190 mAh/g and 429 mAh/g under the current densities of 0.2 A/g and 3.2 A/g, respectively. After more than 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A/g, the capacity still maintains 1100 mAh/g. The CoO-NW@GC illustrates high specific capacity, good stability as well as excellent rate performance.

However, the current MIR compatible materials are fragile, hazardous, and costly, which hampers the performance of MIR devices. Here, we developed a versatile transmittance-based Kramers-Kronig method and obtained the optical properties of graphene oxide in the MIR region, unveiling its application potentials as a novel MIR compatible material. As an example, we demonstrated free-standing graphene oxide MIR polarizers with large extinction ratio (similar to 20 dB) and controllable working wavelength up to 25 mu m, by using the low-cost and flexible direct laser writing technique. Our transmittance-based KK method offers a versatile approach to obtain the optical properties of novel atomic-scale low-dimensional materials in the less developed MIR region and opens up opportunities in high performing functional MIR devices.

Herein, we present a zirconium based metal-organic framework (MOF) composite separator which effectively blocks polysulfides from shuttling without hampering the migration of lithium ions owing to the sieving effect of the MOFs. Moreover, owing to the high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 1418 m(2) g(-1) and chemical interactions with zirconium and oxygen on the MOFs, the polysulfides can also be physically and chemically adsorbed on the surface of the MOFs, which further blocks the polysulfides from shuttling through the intergranular channels of the MOF particles. In addition, the wettability of the composite separator with the electrolyte is enhanced owing to the polar functional groups of -COOH and -OH on the MOFs. The battery with a composite separator delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1239 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and 1147.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C. The reversible capacity is maintained at 964.1 mA h g(-1) with an average fading of only 0.08% per cycle at 0.5C. The capacity at the 2C rate with the composite separator is 955.8 mA h g(-1), which is far more than that of the pristine separator, which is 289.2 mA h g(-1).

The calculated total energy of SW40 is just about 133 meV higher than that of graphene, indicating that its excellent stability exceeds all the previously proposed graphene allotropes. We find that SW40 exhibits an intrinsic type-III Dirac cone [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 237403 (2018)] formed by band crossing of local linear and flat bands, which can result in highly anisotropic fermions in the system. Interestingly, such an intrinsic type-III Dirac cone can be effectively tuned by inner-layer strain and it will be transferred into type-I and type-II Dirac cones under tensile and compressed strain, respectively. Finally, a general tight-binding model was constructed to understand the electronic properties near the Fermi level in SW40. The results show that type-III Dirac cone features can be well understood by the pi-electron interactions between adjacent Stone-Wales defects.

The elemental sulfur was mixed with Vapor-Grown Carbon Fiber (VGCF) and with the solid electrolyte (amorphous Li3PS4) by using high-energy ball-milling process. The obtained sulfur-VGVF-solid electrolyte composite was used as positive electrode materials of the all-solidstate battery. The composite showed good electrochemical properties as positive electrode materials. The capacity that was calculated on the base of the weight of sulfur was about 1300 mAhg(-1) at room temperature, when the all-solid-state battery was discharged and charged in the voltage range of 0.9 to 2.6 V at a constant current density of 0.1 mAcm(-2). The battery kept the capacity more than 1200 mAhg(-1) even after 50 discharge-charge cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we report an effective interface engineering strategy to prepare metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals tightly encapsulated by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via strong chemical interaction as a free-standing anode for PIB. Based on experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, we systematically investigated the effect of the chemical-bonded interface between MOF nanocrystals and conductive rGO and revealed that the strong chemical interface can substantially enhance the adsorption energy and ion transport kinetics of the potassium ion within the MOF nanocrystals compared to the physical mixture of MOF and rGO with almost the same microscopic morphologies. As a result, such an MOF-rGO hybrid with strong interfacial chemical couplings delivered an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 422 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), superior rate performance (202 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)), and outstanding long-term cycling performance (an ultralow decay rate of 0.013% per cycle after 2000 cycles at 2 A g(-1)), which are not only significantly better than those of the physical mixture of MOF/rGO but also among the best for anodes for PIB reported thus far.

Herein we describe a synthesis strategy to engineer tunable HPC materials across micro-, meso-, and macroporous length scales, allowing the fabrication of a graphitic HPC material (HPC-G) with both very high surface area (>2500 m(2)/g) and pore volume (>11 cm(3)/g), the combination of which has not been attained previously. The mesopore volume alone for these materials is up to 7.53 cm(3)/g, the highest ever reported, higher than even any porous carbons total pore volume, which for our HPC-G material was >11 cm(3)/g. This HPC-G material was explored for use both as a supercapacitor electrode and for oil adsorption, two applications that require either high surface area or large pore volume, textural properties that are typically exclusive to one another. We accomplished these high textural characteristics by employing ice templating not only as a route for macroporous formation but as a synergistic vehicle that enabled the significant loading of the mesoporous hard template. This design scheme for HPC-G materials can be utilized in broad applications, including electrochemical systems such as batteries and supercapacitors, sorbents, and catalyst supports, particularly supports where a high degree of thermal stability is required.

The SSiGO was introduced into sulfonated poly (phthalazinone ether ketone) (SPPEK) to obtain composite membranes (SSiGO/SPPEK), and the physicochemical and electrochemical properties were extensively investigated. The results show that this SSiGO/SPPEK composite membranes possess excellent thermal and dimensional stability and super high proton conductivity.

The strategy, based on a colloidal crystal-templating method, utilizes nitrogenous dopamine as the precursor due to its unique properties, including self-polymerization under mild alkaline conditions, coating onto various surfaces, a high carbonization yield, and well-preserved nitrogen doping after heat treatment. The obtained NHPC-3D possesses a high surface area of 1056 m(2)g(-1), a large pore volume of 2.56 cm(3) g(-1), and a high nitrogen content of 8.2 wt%. The NHPC-3D is implemented as the electrode material of a supercapacitor and exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 252 F g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1). The device also shows a high capacitance retention of 75.7% at a higher current density of 20 A g(-1) in aqueous electrolyte due to a sufficient surface area for charge accommodation, reversible pseudocapacitance, and minimized ion-transport resistance, as a result of the advantageous interconnected hierarchical porous texture. These results showcase NHPC-3D as a promising candidate for electrode materials in super capacitors.

In this paper, the interactions between plasmid DNA and seven different complexes were investigated, and the methods to change the interaction patterns by graphene oxide (GO) or concentrations were also investigated. The cleavage of pUC19 DNA promoted by target complexes were via hydrolytic or oxidative mechanisms at low concentrations ranging from 3.13 x 10(-7) to 6.25 x 10(-5) mol/L. Dinuclear complexes 2a and 2b can promote the cleavage of plasmid pUC19 DNA to a linear form at pH values below 7.0. Furthermore, binuclear hybrid complexes could condense DNA as nanoparticles above 3.13 x 10(-5) mol/L and partly release DNA by graphene oxide with - stacking. Meanwhile, the results also reflected that graphene oxide could prevent DNA from breaking down. Cell viability assays showed dinuclear complexes were safe to normal human hepatic cells at relative high concentrations. The present work might help to develop novel strategies for the design and synthesis of DNA controllable releasing agents, which may be applied to gene delivery and also to exploit the new application for GO.

The purpose of this paper is to understand the direct and indirect impact of these industrial linkages. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a hypothetical extraction method with its various extensions. Under this method, different carbon linkages of a block are removed from the economy, and the effects of carbon linkages are determined by the difference between the original and the post-removal values. Energy and non-energy carbon linkages are also estimated. Findings "Electricity, gas and water supply (EGW)" at 655.61 Mt and 648.74 Mt had the highest total and forward linkages. "manufacturing and recycling" at 231.48 Mt had the highest backward linkage. High carbon-intensive blocks of "EGW" plus "mining and quarrying" were net emitters, while others were net absorbers. "Fuel and chemicals" at 0.08 Mt had almost neutral status. Hard coal was the main source of direct and indirect emissions. Practical implications - Net emitting and key net forward blocks should reduce direct emission intensities. India should use its huge geographical potential for industrial accessibility to cheaper alternative energy. This alongside with technology/process improvements catalyzed by policy tools can help in mitigation efforts. Next, key net-backward blocks such as construction through intermediate purchases significantly stimulate emissions from other blocks. Tailored mitigation policies are needed in this regard. Originality/value By developing an understanding of India's industrial carbon links, this study can guide policymakers. In addition, the paper lays out the framework for estimating energy and non-energy-based industrial carbon links.

The Raman signal associated with the vibrational modes of the sulfur chain is observed when it is confined by small-diameter metallic nanotubes. Moreover, a strong enhancement of the Raman signal is observed for excitation energies corresponding to the formation of excited nanotube-chain-hybrid electronic states. Our hypothesis was further tested by high pressure Raman measurements and confirmed by density functional theory calculations of the electronic density of states of hybrid systems formed by sulfur chains encapsulated by different types of single-wall carbon nanotubes.

Several issues, such as the insulation of sulfur and the shuttle effect caused by highly soluble polysulfides, are alleviated by encapsulating sulfur into a conductive framework. However, those methods inevitably sacrifice both the gravimetrically and volumetrically energy density of the fabricated cells. In this context, the issues mentioned above are ameliorated via a commercial Glass Fiber membrane coated with Ketjen Black (KB, commercial EC 600 JD) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) as the separator. Bare sublimed sulfur is employed as the cathode. When being cycled at 0.2C, the Li/S cell, using the membrane coating 20wt% TiO2 and 50wt% KB as separator, presents 1196 and 729mAhg(-1) in the 1st and 200th cycle, respectively. Even being cycled at 2C, the cell still shows 531mAhg(-1) reversible capacity after 100 cycles. Such good performance could be attributed to: (1) the highly conductive KB within the coated layer offers additional electron pathways covering the top surface of the bare sulfur cathode and (2) the coated layer can form chemical binding with lithium polysulfides via TiO2 and physically adsorb the lithium polysulfides through KB, both alleviating the shuttle effect.

There are two instruments installed on the TanSat: the High Resolution Hyper-Spectral Sensor for carbon observation Grating Spectrometer, aiming at measuring the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, and the cloud and aerosol polarimetric imager to identify the disturbance by clouds and to detect the impact of aerosol within the instrument instantaneous field of view. The two instruments work together to make global, high-precision CO2 measurements with exactly correction of cloud and aerosol interference. The major content of this paper is the laboratory radiometric calibration of ACGS. Both the gain coefficients and the dark current response of each channel were determined during instrument-level ground testing. The gain coefficients for the ACGS were characterized by measuring the instrument response to illumination by an integrating sphere at several light levels. The dark response was calibrated with additional thermal balance testing. This paper also identified bad pixels, recorded in a table of data elements, to be omitted in science data processing. The uncertainties achieved during the radiometric calibration were below 5% (k = 1), meeting the absolute calibration mission requirements.

However, physical isolation of sulfur in the channels is not sufficient to prevent the shuttle of lithium-sulfide intermediates that eventually results in a poor performance of lithium-sulfur energy storage. Herein, we report a strategy based on imine-linked frameworks for addressing this shuttle issue by covalently engineering polysulfide chains on the pore walls. The imine linkages can trigger the polymerization of sulfur to form polysulfide chains and anchor them on the channel walls. The immobilized polysulfide chains suppress the shuttle effect and are highly redox active. This structural evolution induces multifold positive effects on energy storage and achieves improved capacity, sulfur accessibility, rate capability and cycle stability. Our results suggest a porous platform achieved by pore wall engineering for tackling key issues in energy storage.

A look into the future	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							POLYMER ELECTROLYTES; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; LIQUIDS; CHALLENGES; ELECTRODES; CATALYSTS; ANODE; CELL	A critical overview of the latest developments in the lithium ion batteries technology is reported. We first describe the evolution in the electrolyte area with particular attention to ionic liquids, discussing the expected application of these room temperature molten salts and listing the issues that still prevent their practical implementation. The attention is then focused on the electrode materials presently considered the most promising for enhancing the energy density of the batteries. At the anode side a discussion is provided on the status of development of high capacity tin and silicon lithium alloys. We show that the morphology that is the most likely to ensure commercial exploitation of these alloy electrodes is that involving carbon-based nanocomposites. We finally touch on super-high-capacity batteries, discussing the key cases of lithium-sulfur and lithium-air and attempting to forecast their chances to eventually reach the status of practically appealing energy storage systems. We conclude with a brief reflection on the amount of lithium reserves in view of its large use in the case of global conversion from gasoline-powered cars to hybrid and electric cars.

However, the use of commercially available Li-metal wires as anodes nowadays confronts many electrochemical and mechanical issues such as dendrite formation, low yield strength, and poor fatigue resistance. Here, a flexible and stable Li-metal composite yarn (LMCY) is designed via a fast capillary filling of molten Li into metallic carbon yarn for fabricating high-energy-density and long-lasting wire-type Li-metal batteries. LMCY shows outstanding electrochemical cyclic stability, mechanical strength, flexibility, and durability. Pairing lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) with the LMCY as anode results in a foldable LFP||Li full cell that delivers a high energy density over 290 Wh L-1 and a long lifetime over 800 cycles with a capacity retention of over 50% after 750 charge/discharge cycles. The seamless integration of this wire-shape LFP||Li cell with commercial textiles is demonstrated as a built-in power supply to wearable electronics, while maintaining the excellent breathability of the textiles. LMCYs are also adaptable to other high-performance wire-type batteries, such as lithium-sulfur battery.

This involves electrode materials that contain carbon and metal oxide phases linked on a nanoscopic level and combine characteristics of supercapacitors and batteries. The combination of the components requires careful design to create synergistic effects for an increased electrochemical performance. Improved understanding of the role of carbon as a substrate has advanced the power handling and cycling stability of hybrid materials significantly in recent years. This Concept outlines different design strategies for the design of hybrid electrode materials: (1) the deposition of metal oxides on readily existing carbon substrates and (2) co-synthesizing both carbon and metal oxide phase during the synthesis procedure. The implications of carbon properties on the hybrid material's structure and performance will be assessed and the impact of the hybrid electrode architecture will be analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of all approaches are highlighted and strategies to overcome the latter will be proposed.

GNSs were determined to be of high quality and good dispersivity, with a typical diameter size of 15 x 8 nm. Light absorption measurements showed that GNSs had an absorption band edge at 3.3 eV. They also showed sharp and regular excitonic emitting peaks in the ultraviolet and visible region (2.06-3.6 eV). Moreover, phonon replicas with longterm stability appeared with the excitonic peaks at room temperature. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence from the GNSs revealed that the excitonic emission derived from free and bound excitonic recombination. A physical model based on band energy theory was constructed to analyse the carrier transport of GNSs. The Ni nanocrystallites on Si-NPA, which acted as a metal-enhanced fluorescence substrate, were supposed to accelerate the excitonic recombination of GNSs and enhanced the measured emission intensity. Results of this study would be valuable in determining the luminescence mechanism of GNSs and could be applied in real-world optoelectronic devices.

The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) data proved the existence and uniform distribution of C element in the hybrid. We further demonstrated the successful encapsulation of alpha-Fe2O3 grains by extremely small graphene pieces through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As a proof-of-concept demonstration of the function, the as-prepared samples were utilized as gas-sensing materials to explore their potential applications. Results showed that the optimal hybrid exhibited a response of 8.2-5 ppm of NO2 at room temperature (RT), which was 3.9 times higher than that of undoped alpha-Fe2O3 (125 degrees C). The hybrid sensor also displayed a short response time of 2.1 min, an excellent NO2 selectivity, a long-term stability of 20days and an extremely low detection limit of 50 ppb toward NO2 at RT. The significantly enhanced NO2 sensing properties could be attributed to much higher specific surface area, more defects and local p-n heterojunctions in the hybrid. We consider that our work could provide a fresh idea for the future design of high-performance room temperature gas sensors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The oxygen-deficient magnetite of Fe3O4+delta (0 < delta < 1) was prepared using H-2 reduction of Fe3O4+delta (0 < delta < 0.5) at 573 K and its properties (lattice constant, magnetism, stability, and reduction ability) were studied ih detail. The activity of decomposing CO2 with oxygen-deficient magnetite of different sizes were compared and the effects of degree of oxygen-deficiency, reaction time, and temperature on the activity of the decomposing CO2 into carbon with oxygen-deficient magnetite were investigated. It is found that oxygen in the CO2 was incorporated in the form of O2- into oxygen-deficient magnetite and CO2 was reduced to carbon, at the same time Fe3O4-delta converted into stoichiometric Fe3O4. The smaller the particle size of magnetite is, the larger the oxygen-deficient degree is, the higher the reaction temperature is, and the higher the activity of decomposing CO2 is.

One-Pot Synthesis of Biomass-Based Hierarchical Porous Carbons with a Large Porosity Development	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							CARBIDE-DERIVED CARBON; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; DOUBLE-LAYER CAPACITORS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; CHEMICAL ACTIVATION; ELECTRODE MATERIAL; CO2 ADSORPTION; SUPERCAPACITORS; HYDROCHAR; ENERGY	A sustainable one-pot scheme for the synthesis of hierarchical porous carbons formed from biomass is developed herein. It is based on the carbonization of biomass-derived products (glucose, glucosamine, soya flour, and microalgae) in the presence of an activating agent (potassium oxalate) and calcium carbonate nanoparticles that form a hard template. During carbonization, double carbonates are formed in situ, which results in modifications in the morphology and size of the template nanoparticles, giving rise to a carbon material with an open macroporous foam-like structure rich in micro-/mesopores, the latter developing via a redox reaction between the carbon and potassium carbonate and also as a result of the reaction between the carbon and the evolved CO2. The porosity can be tailored by selecting an appropriate precursor. Thus, the carbon materials are basically micro-/macroporous in the case of glucose and glucosamine, and micro-/meso-/macroporous when soya flour and microalgae are used. A direct relationship is observed between the amount of nitrogen present in the precursor and mesopore development. Hence, the addition of urea to the mixture of glucose and potassium oxalate and CaCO3 nanoparticles also yields micro-/meso-/macroporous carbons. The materials synthesized at 800 degrees C have large surface areas in the similar to 1800-3100 m(2)/g range. At 7.50 degrees C, the materials synthesized from N-rich biomass combine ultralarge surface areas of 2400-3050 m(2)/g and a remarkable N-doping (2-3 wt % N). This combination of textural and chemical properties is highly appealing for many energy-related applications and also for adsorption-based processes.

Enhanced stability of hydrogen atoms at the graphene/graphane interface of nanoribbons	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							GRAPHENE; ADSORPTION; GRAPHANE; BOND	The thermal stability of graphene/graphane nanoribbons (GGNRs) is investigated using density functional theory. It is found that the energy barriers for the diffusion of hydrogen atoms on the zigzag and armchair interfaces of GGNRs are 2.86 and 3.17 eV, respectively, while the diffusion barrier of an isolated H atom on pristine graphene was only similar to 0.3 eV. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the thermal stability of GGNRs can be enhanced significantly by increasing the hydrogen diffusion barriers through graphene/graphane interface engineering. This may provide new insights for viable applications of GGNRs. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3525377]	[Ao, Z.

Here, we fabricate freestanding bulk electrodes by depositing TiO2 onto a CNT sponge via a simple in situ hydrolysis method, creating coaxial units of TiO2-wrapped CNTs. The built-in CNT framework supports a uniform thin crystalline TiO2 forming a highly porous, conductive and compressible composite sponge. As an anode material for Li ion batteries, the TiO2-CNT sponges exhibit stable charging/discharging plateau voltages, excellent cycling stability and rate performance. In particular, these sponges can be compressed to much smaller volumes with significantly improved areal capacity, which cannot be achieved by powder-form electrodes. Our hierarchical sponges with optimized microstructures may serve as stable and compressible electrodes for various energy storage systems such as Li-ion, Na-ion and Li-S batteries.

J	Yang, S; Jiang, Y; Li, S; Liu, W				Yang, Sha; Jiang, Yingda; Li, Shuang; Liu, Wei			Many-body dispersion effects on the binding of TCNQ and F4-TCNQ with graphene	CARBON			English	Article							LONG-RANGE; ADSORPTION STRUCTURES	Predictive modeling and understanding of binding of organic molecule-decorated graphene is an essential prerequisite for tuning their electronic and magnetic properties. Many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions are known to contribute significantly to the binding of condensed matters, but the role of MBD energy in self-assembled organic monolayers on epitaxial graphene remains largely unexplored. Here, by using the state-of-the-art DFT + MBD method, we for the first time investigate model pi-pi adsorption systems that are composed of two typical acceptor molecules, TCNQ and F4-TCNQ and graphene sheets. The computed binding energies from the DFT MBD method are consistently smaller than those from the pairwise-based van der Waals (vdW) inclusive method, such as DFT vdW, due to the accurate capture of both electrodynamic screening and many-body effects in the former case. Notably, many-body effects contribute more to the low-coverage adsorption systems than they do when the substrate is highly covered by the adsorbates. This somewhat counter-intuitive result is attributed to the fact that each molecule contributes less to the polarization of the hybrid interface at high coverage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nearly 52% increase in the yield of NDC is observed by activation with ZnCl2 due to an increase in the thermal stability of Zn2+- fish protein complex compared to the protein alone. The NDCs obtained are characterized by XRD, IR, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, elemental analysis and N-2 adsorption-desorption studies. The activation at 550 degrees C produces NDC with the highest surface area and total pore volume of 1001 m(2) g(-1) and 0.719 cm(3) g(-1), respectively, at a ZnCl2 to fish powder weight ratio of 3.A maximum micropore volume of 0.273 cm(3) g(-1) is obtained at a ZnCl2 to fish powder weight ratio of 1: 1. The N-content (12.4-5.2 wt%) decreases with an increase in activation temperature and ZnCl2 to fish powder weight ratio. The NDC obtained by activation at 550 degrees C at a ZnCl2 to fish powder weight ratio of 1: 1 shows the maximum CO2 adsorption capacity of 2.4 and 3.73 mmol g(-1) at 25 and 0 degrees C, respectively, at 1 atmosphere. The CO2 adsorption on the NDC shows excellent cyclic stability and high selectivity over nitrogen gas.

However, considering their poor cycling life and rate performance, critical challenges remain. In this contribution, we describe hollow NiS2/CoS2@C composites obtained by stepwise etching, annealing, and sulfuration of ZIF-67. Specifically, NiS2/CoS2 particles were dispersed on N/S co-doped carbon nanocages and found to exhibit outstanding stability and rate performance. The unique nanocage structure of N/S co-doped carbon and heterogeneous interfaces of NiS2 and CoS2 can promote both ion transport and electron transfer, enriching the active site for enhanced reactivity. The resulting NiS2/CoS2@C nanocage composites in fact showed considerable electrochemical performance, with a specific capacity of 1373 C g(-1 ) at 1 A g(-1 ). When combined with reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-based negative electrode, the assembled hybrid supercapacitor registered an energy density of 63.3 Wh kg(-1 )at a power density of 800 W kg(-1 ), retaining exceeding 98% of the initial capacity even after 13,000 cycles.

Full range of proximity effect probed with superconductor/graphene/superconductor junctions	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							ENERGY-GAP; GRAPHENE; SUPERCURRENT	The high tunability of the density of states of graphene makes it an ideal probe of quantum transport in different regimes. In particular, the supercurrent that can flow through a nonsuperconducting (N) material connected to two superconducting (S) electrodes, crucially depends on the length of the N relative to the superconducting coherence length. Using graphene as the N material we have investigated the full range of the superconducting proximity effect, from short to long diffusive junctions. By combining several S/graphene/S samples with different contacts and lengths, and measuring their gate-dependent critical currents (I-c) and normal state resistance RN, we compare the product eR(N)I(c) to the relevant energies, the Thouless energy in long junctions and the superconducting gap of the contacts in short junctions, over three orders of magnitude of Thouless energy. The experimental variations strikingly follow a universal law, close to the predictions of the proximity effect both in the long and short junction regime, as well as in the crossover region, thereby revealing the interplay of the different energy scales. Differences in the numerical coefficients reveal the crucial role played by the interfacial barrier between graphene and the superconducting electrodes, which reduces the supercurrent in both short and long junctions. Surprisingly, the reduction of supercurrent is independent of the gate voltage and of the nature of the electrodes. A reduced induced gap and Thouless energy are extracted, revealing the role played by the dwell time in the barrier in the short junction, and an effective increased diffusion time in the long junction. We compare our results to the theoretical predictions of Usadel equations and numerical simulations, which better reproduce experiments with imperfect NS interfaces.

These structures contain a rhombohedral-HgO as core and a hexagonal C as shell. In special thermal treatment, the HgO-cores are removed from core-shell composite and the hollow carbon Nanospheres (HCNSs) remain. The properties of these new core-shell structures and the HCNSs were characterized by TEM, SAED, SEM, XRD, AFM, FT-IR and TGA. The electronic structure and conductivity properties of the hollow carbon nanospheres were also investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) technique. The local currents images on the surface of HCNSs was recorded by STM and the differential conductance (dI/dV) measurements of the synthesized hollow carbon nanospheres was carried out using an improved method by STS. The HCNSs I-V curve follows from the quantum behavior. It was observed that the HCNSs had acceptable conductivity properties.

When it is used in all-solid-state lithium batteries, there is always high resistance to lithium ion transfer, leading to a poor rate and cycle performance. In this work, polymeric sulfur is synthesized to resolve this problem. Sulfur is copolymerized with poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PMEMA) and 1,3-diisopropenyl-benzene (DIB). PMEMA is an acrylate monomer, which can undergo radical copolymerization with sulfur diradicals. Its oligoethylene oxide side chain can transfer lithium ions, providing an intrinsic ion-conducting character, good dispersibility, and compatibility for the final polymeric sulfur material, named poly(S-PMEMA-DIB). It is applied to all-solid-state lithium batteries as the positive material, with the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3) (LAGP)/polyethylene oxide (PEO) composite as the all-solid-state electrolyte. Because poly(S-PMEMA-DIB) can disperse well in acetonitrile and shows good compatibility with LAGP, the electrode can be prepared easily with a uniform structure. Also, because of the intrinsically ionic conductivity of this polymeric sulfur, the interfacial resistance of the electrode is reduced. All-solid-state batteries made from poly(S-PMEMA-DIB) demonstrate an improved rate and cycle performance compared with those made from elemental sulfur, delivering high reversible capacities of 1140 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and 600 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C.

Exploring highly abundant and available biowaste precursors remaining from food processing throughout a scalable and cost-effective material synthesis path is highly important especially for new materials discovery in emerging energy storage technologies such as lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we have produced a series of carbon materials with hierarchical micro-/mesopores from a very cheap and abundant lignocellulosic bio-waste, namely rice husk. The carbonisation of the lignocellulosic fraction leads to the formation of micropores while the removal of the silica present naturally in the rice husk composition allows the formation of mesopores. We can easily tune the ratio of micropores to mesopores by simply tuning the synthesis conditions in order to achieve an optimal performance in Li-S batteries after sulphur infiltration into the resulting porous carbons. Our optimal cathode scaffold for Li-S batteries exhibited a high capacity of 1032 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 C. An ultralow decay rate of 0.055% per cycle was achieved. The appearance of abundant micropores with a higher surface area renders a high initial capacity of sulphur to polysulphides; however, the sufficient mesopore volume is more vital for a lower cyclic decay, which is prerequisite for the generation of solid products and smooth ion diffusion. This work, besides reporting on an efficient method to produce efficient electrode materials from waste to be used in energy storage technologies also provides fresh insights into the required structural features to allow effective cathode materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Results showed that only biochar and activated carbon could promote CO utilization when the p(CO) increased from 0.07 to 0.21 atm and promoted CO methanization but was delayed until the p(CO) further increased from 0.21 to 0.41 atm. Compared to the control without carbon material addition, the CO conversion rate increased by up to 149% and 193% and the methane (CH4) production rate was up to 238% and 186%, respectively, for the biochar and activated carbon scenarios. Graphene and carbon cloth did not accelerate CO utilization but could stabilize the bioreaction at a high p(CO). Natural stable carbon isotope signals revealed that CH4 production from CO was mainly via acetate at low pc and via hydrogen at high p(CO). Results from high-throughput sequencing showed that biochar and activated carbon boosted the growth of Rikenellaceae and Thiobacillus in the solid phase. Synergistaceae which can be in coculture with Methanobacterium was boosted in the liquid phase in biochar group and activated carbon group.

A series of experimental methods was applied to follow the formation of sulfur surface derivatives: elemental analysis, basic surface groups analysis by back-titration, ESCA, and FTIR. It was shown that surface carbonyl groups are transformed into thiones whereas, on air exposure, after P2S5 treatment, oxygen content increases significantly, demonstrating the formation of other sulfur groups very sensitive to oxidation. These groups are decomposed upon water extraction of the blacks. The surface properties, as shown by water adsorption isotherms, are modified.

Compared with a lithium/sulfur battery, the use of a lithium/Sn-C composite anode ensures the high safety of the new battery. Meanwhile, the novel battery possesses high-energy characteristics. It delivers a reversible capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g(-1), which ensures a stable specific energy of 410 W h kg(-1). As all of the materials required for the new battery are readily available and low-cost, and the techniques are simple, this new battery has a strong potential for use in industry. Furthermore, there is considerable room for improvement of the energy density of the sulfur/lithium-ion battery, and the new battery is one of the most promising candidates for the next generation of high-performance rechargeable batteries.

Moreover, the formation of insoluble polysulfides (Na2Sn, 2 <= n < 4) can slow down the reaction kinetics and terminate the discharge reaction before it reaches the final product. In this work, coffee residue derived activated ultramicroporous coffee carbon (ACC) material loading with small sulfur molecules (S2-4) as cathode material for RT Na-S batteries is reported. The first principle calculations indicate the space confinement of the slit ultramicropores can effectively suppress the formation of polysulfides (Na2Sn, 2 <= n <= 8). Combining with in situ UV/vis spectroscopy measurements, one-step reaction RT Na-S batteries with Na2S as the only and final discharge product without polysulfides formation are demonstrated. As a result, the ultramicroporous carbon loaded with 40 wt% sulfur delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1492 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)). When cycled at 1 C rate, the carbon-sulfur composite electrode exhibits almost no capacity fading after 2000 cycles with 100% coulombic efficiency, revealing excellent cycling stability and reversibility. The superb cycling stability and rate performance demonstrate ultramicropore confinement can be an effective strategy to develop high performance cathode for RT Na-S batteries.

In present work, a sensitive electrochemical sensor based on the specific boronic acid-diol binding for glucose sensing was established. The sensor was consisted of 3-aminophenylboronic acid (APBA) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Before the modification of electrodes, graphene oxide (GO) and APBA composites (GO/APBA) were compounded by the dehydration condensation reaction. The rGO and APBA composites (rGO/APBA) were reduced from GO/APBA and deposited onto the screen printed electrodes, through cyclic voltammetry, simultaneously. With the rGO/APBA functionalized electrodes, the glucose molecule could be detected in the range from 0.1 mM to 50 mM, which could satisfy the clinical application. In order to verify the sensitivity and selectivity of the rGO/APBA functionalized electrodes, GO/APBA, and rGO alone functionalized electrodes were also explored for glucose determination. Results showed that rGO/APBA modified electrodes possessed superior electron conductivity, which promoted the detection properties in impedance spectroscopy. In our study, an easy and simple cost-effective modification method was proposed by one step electrochemical reduction and deposition technique of rGO on screen printed electrodes. With specific modification, the rGO functionalized electrodes provided a sensitive and selective detection of biological analytes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For comparison, we prepared ex situ MoS2 and S cathodes (EMS) with a similar S/MoS2 mole ratio to that of in situ-prepared cathodes. Discharge capacity of EMS cathodes dropped by 80% after first few cycles, while assembled MGC cells demonstrated an initial discharge capacity of 1649 mA h/g, achieving close to theoretical capacity of elemental sulfur (1675 mA h/g) at C/3 and a reversible capacity of 1500 mA h/g was obtained in further cycles. The MoS2 nanostructure evolution after initial discharge helped in extending the cycle life of assembled cells even at a high C rate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed to understand the structural stability of intermediate MoS3 and possible electrochemical reactions pertaining to Li+ insertion in MoS2 and S. Based on DFT studies, MoS3 undergoes stoichiometric decomposition to stable MoS2 and S. Furthermore, electrochemical analysis confirmed the redox activity of MoS2 and S at 1.3 and 1.8 V against Li/Li+, respectively.

The results showed that INPs increased the equilibrium time for the adsorption of E2 to GO. Higher Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of INPs resulted in lower diffusion rate of E2, and thus the adsorption rate constant (k(2)) calculated from pseudo-second-order kinetic model negatively correlated with the BET surface area of INPs (p = 0.037). In addition, INPs decreased the adsorption amount of E2 to GO, and the inhibition effects declined in the order of Al2O3 > ZnO > TiO2 > SiO2 > Fe2O3. This is determined by the interactions between GO and INPs. The positively charged ZnO and Al2O3 strongly heteroaggregate with GO via electrostatic attraction, and then significantly inhibited E2 adsorption to GO. In contrast, the homoaggregation of GO was superior to its heteroaggregation with negatively charged SiO2 and TiO2, and then lower inhibition of E2 adsorption to GO was induced. Fe2O3 with less negative charge (- 8.48 mV) led to the lowest inhibition effect on E2 adsorption to GO because of its preferable homoaggregation. The results were further confirmed by Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek calculation, transmission electron microscopy, and sedimentation experiments. This study revealed how the properties of INPs influence their effects on the adsorption of E2 by GO, and the findings are critical to understand the behavior and fate of GO and pollutants in natural aquatic environment.

However, the needed centrifugation after adsorption and the potential biological toxicity of GO restricted its applications in wastewater treatment. In this study, a facile method is provided by using biopolymers to mediate and synthesize 3D GO based gels. The obtained hybrid gels present well-defined and interconnected 3D porous network, which allows the adsorbate molecules to diffuse easily into the adsorbent. The adsorption experiments indicate that the obtained porous GO-biopolymer gels can efficiently remove cationic dyes and heavy metal ions from wastewater. Methylene blue (MB) and methyl violet (MV), two cationic dyes, are chosen as model adsorbates to investigate the adsorption capability and desorption ratio; meanwhile, the influence of contacting time, initial concentration, and pH value on the adsorption capacity of the prepared GO-biopolymer gels are also studied. The GO-biopolymer gels displayed an adsorption capacity as high as 1100 mg/g for MB dye and 1350 mg/g for MV dye, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of the MB were studied in details. The experimental data of MB adsorption fitted well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm, and the results indicated that the adsorption process was controlled by the intraparticle diffusion. Moreover, the adsorption data revealed that the porous GO-biopolymer gels showed good selective adsorbability to cationic dyes and metal ions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, most of the designed interlayers possess extra heavy weight, casting additional technical challenges toward practical high-specific-energy batteries. Herein, an ultralight self-standing interlayer with an extremely low mass loading (similar to 0.14 mg cm(-2)), composed of porous curly carbon fibers derived from natural biomass with inlaid cobalt electrocatalysts (CF-Co), was engineered via a convenient way. After replacing the poor conductivity sulfur (similar to 10(-28) S m(-1)) by higher conductivity selenium disulfide (SeS2 ,similar to 10(-6) S m(-1)) as active cathode materials, the hierarchically porous-structured, conductive CF-Co interlayer with outstanding adsorptive and electrocatalytic effects is introduced into the resulted Li-SeS2 batteries to capture dual-intermediate polysulfides/polyselenides, boost their conversion kinetics, and ensure favorable running of Li-SeS2 cells with high SeS2 loading and lean electrolyte. Consequently, the coin cells deliver outstanding high-rate capability (404 mAh g(-1) at 8 A g(-1)) and superior cycling stability (similar to 81.5% areal capacity retention in 125 cycles) under high SeS2 loading (5.0 mg cm(-2)). Significantly, practical high-areal-capacity (>5.5 mAh cm(-2)) Li-SeS2 pouch cells can be realized by assembling this interlayer with double-side SeS2-loading cathodes (132 mg), working stably at relatively lower electrolyte condition (6.0 mu L mg(-1)).

However, their commercial implementation is impeded by the lack of suitable sulphur cathodes that have high electrochemical stability and high sulphur loading using a low electrolyte/sulphur ratio. In this work, reduced graphene oxide functionalized with MnO2 nanosheets was demonstrated as a sulphur cathode (MnO2@rGO/S). The high polarity of the MnO2 nanosheets grown on the rGO surface is beneficial for the uniform distribution of sulphur, providing access to Li+ and immobilizing polysulfides in the cathode region. This leads to an improved electrolyte wettability, promoted sulphur utilization and enhanced reaction kinetics. As a result, the obtained cathode enables superior cyclability over 500 cycles with a capacity fading rate of only 0.034% per cycle. Moreover, a sulphur content of 70 wt% with an electrolyte/sulphur ratio of 4 mu L mg(-1) is achieved, and the volumetric energy density at the cell level is more than 188 W h L-1 at 1.34 mA cm(-2) using Li-metal as the anode. It is comparable and even superior to those of recently reported carbon-based sulphur batteries.

Herein, Li0.04V2O5 nanowires are densely anchored onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets to form a Li0.04V2O5@rGO nanocomposite by a hydrothermal method with subsequent thermal treatment. Due to this unique structure, the Li0.04V2O5@rGO exhibits remarkable rate performance and excellent cycling stability. Specifically, it delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 738.09 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) in the voltage range of 2.0-4.0 V. After 500 cycles, it still maintains a high capacity of 731.70 mA h g(-1), which represents 95.01% retention of the original reversible capacity. These results indicate that the Li0.04V2O5@rGO could be a promising candidate as cathode active material for long-term cycling performance in lithiumion batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

A well-established, polymeric latex NS synthesis method and a simply modified version of a microwave (MW) energy-based carbonization approach, i.e., Poptube, were systematically combined to obtain these HCNSs. Through this simple, facile, affordable and easily scalable "combined synthesis method," it was managed to successfully produce HCNSs with unique morphological, spectroscopic, thermal and elemental features, all of which were strongly supported by both various material characterization test results and the relevant previous literature data. Thus, it is believed that the as-synthesized CNT or MONW decorated HCNSs (CNT-MONW/HCNS) from the above-mentioned method would soon become the materials of preference for the next-generation advanced applications in various science and engineering fields.

However, SNPC prepared by one-pot method usually features the drawback of low S-content and thereby weakens the synergistic effect both geometrically and electronically. Herein, we reported one facile synthetic approach to prepare high S-content SNPC. In this regard, the introduction of NaH2PO4 into the pyrolysis of S, N-containing precursor is beneficial to confine S atoms in carbon framework. It is found that S-content is 25.05% for SNPPC-700, 12.58% for SNPPC-800, higher than previously reported results. Structural characterizations indicate that NaH2PO4 salt plays an important role. Furthermore, LIBs test shows high S-content SNPPC800 features the higher capacities of 977.68 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles than those of low S-content SNPC800 at 100 mA g(-1). Moreover, ORR activity measurements show a slight better performance and cycling durability than low S-content SNPC. In addition, the SNPPC-800 also reveals excellent supercapacitor performance with an specific capacitance of 227.5 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), and kept 160.29 F g(-1) via the measurement of 6000 cycles at 10 A g(-1).

Over the past few decades, with the development of eddy covariance technology, the carbon fluxes of farmlands have been determined in many countries. However, studies are very limited for drip irrigation maize the arid regions in northwestern China, which covers a large area where a mixed mode of agriculture and grazing is practiced. Results: To study the effects of drip irrigation on the net ecosystem productivity (NEE), ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP) and net biome productivity (NBP) in the arid regions of northwestern China, we measured the carbon flux annually from 2014 to 2018 using an eddy covariance system. Our results showed that the maize field carbon flux exhibited single-peak seasonal patterns during the growing seasons. During 2014-2018, the NEE, ER and GPP of the drip-irrigated maize field ranged between - 407 similar to - 729 g C m(-2), 485.46 similar to 975.46 g C m(-2), and 1068.23 similar to 1705.30 g C m(-2). In four of the 5 study years, the ER released back to the atmosphere was just over half of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis. The mean daily NEE, ER and GPP were significantly correlated with the net radiation (Rn), air temperature (Ta), leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture (SWC). The results of path analysis showed that leaf area index is the main driving force of seasonal variation of carbon flux. When harvested removals were considered, the annual NBP was - 234 g C m(-2), and the drip-irrigated maize field was a carbon source. Conclusions: This study shows the variation and influencing factors of NEE, ER and GPP in the growth period of spring maize under film drip irrigation in arid areas of northwest China. The ecosystem was a carbon sink before maize harvest, but it was converted into a carbon source considering the carbon emissions after harvest. The variation of carbon flux was influenced by both environmental and vegetation factors, and its leaf area index was the main driver that affects the seasonal variation of carbon flux.

Here, a free-standing ultra-high dispersion Selenium sulfide three-dimensional graphene (SeS2-3DG) was synthesized and used as a cathode material in all-solid-state Lithium-Selenium sulfide (Li-SeS2) batteries for enhancing rate performance and utilization of SeS2. SeS2-3DG achieved the utilization rate of 103% with capacity of 1,163 mAh g(-1) and remained 538.56 mAh g(-1) after 20 cycles under 1/2C. It should be noted that SeS2-3DG exhibited outstanding rate performance, which discharged under 7C with capacity as high as 990 mAh g(-1). Due to the high utilization rate of SeS2, charge and discharge products of Li-SeS2 batteries were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The mechanism of lithium sulfide (Li2S)/ Lithium selenide (Li2Se) <-> SeS2 was confirmed.

Depending on their electrode configurations, FSESDs can contain five differently structured electrodes, including parallel fiber electrodes (PFEs), twisted fiber electrodes (TFDs), wrapped fiber electrodes (WFEs), coaxial fiber devices (CFEs), and rolled electrodes (REs). Various rational methods have been devised to incorporate these fiber-shaped electrodes into multifunctional FSESDs, including fiber-shaped supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-air batteries, zinc-air batteries, and aluminum-air batteries. Although significant progress has been made in FSESDs, it remains a major challenge to make high-performance fiber-shaped devices at low cost. A focused and critical review of the recent advancements in fiber-shaped supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries is provided here. The pros and cons for each of the aforementioned electrode configurations and FSESDs are discussed, along with current challenges and future opportunities for FSESDs.

GO sheets were bonded on the Fc-PED molecules by the chemical reaction between Fc-PED and GO sheets to form Fc-PED-GO composites. Construction of electrochemical sensors using the structure of nano-sized dendrimer will offer compact matrix for the incorporation of GO sheets, which provided more possibilities for the design of sensor to improve the film forming performance and the electrochemical activity of the electrode. GO sheet also provided a larger surface area to facilitate deposition of Fc-PED redox probe, which increased the current response of the modified sensor. The Fc-PED/GO/GCE sensor demonstrated a wide linear detection range of 0.06-1200 mu mol.L-1 with a low detection limit of 0.04 mu mol.L-1. Furthermore, the sensor showed higher sensitivity, good selectivity and reproducibility towards DMEP detection. The feasibility of the electrochemical sensor was proved by successful detection of DMEP in real liquor samples. Possible synergistic effect of Fc-PED and GO towards DMEP detection are proposed based on experimental results.

It is demonstrated that sulfur uniformly distributes among the boundary and interior of the carbon skeleton with the formation of S-C bonds. Moreover, the interior sulfur can be electrochemically activated under 0.5 V and then functions as a capacity sponsor, because Na+ can freely transfer into the carbon interlayer (with a stable enlarged distance of similar to 0.4 nm after the first cycle) via adsorption-like behavior to be combined with the interior sulfur in the following cycles. Thus, the activated covalent-SC composite delivers ultrahigh reversible capacities of 888.9 and 811.4 mAh g(-1) after 600 and 950 deep cycles at 0.8C and 1.6C, respectively. Furthermore, it exhibits outstanding rate performance with the capacity of 700 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 8.1C.

Sulfur copolymers with high sulfur contents of up to 90 wt% were prepared via inverse vulcanization from environment-friendly, sustainable raw materials: cost-effective waste-product elemental sulfur and eugenol allyl ether (EAE), which is obtained from clove oil. The thermal properties and electrochemical activities of the resulting poly(S-co-EAE) materials can be tuned by controlling the EAE : S feed ratio. Employed as a cathode material in Li-S batteries, the copolymer with 90 wt% sulfur content provides good cycling stability at a capacity of similar to 650 mA h g(-1) and high Coulombic efficiencies (> 99%) over 100 cycles.

Similar to S cathode, however, the practical application of SeS2 cathode is also impeded by poor cycling performance caused by the shuttling phenomenon of soluble lithium polysulfides/selenides. In this work, a graphene sponge/titanium nitride (TiN) nanowires composite is prepared as the well-designed multi-functional hybrid interlayer to be applied in Li-SeS2 batteries for the first time. The three-dimensional porous conductive framework constructed by graphene nanoscrolls/ nanosheets coexited sponge and TiN nanowires provides efficient transfer channels for electrons and ions. Moreover, TiN not only has strong chemical adsorption to trap the soluble polysulfides/selenides, but also possesses electrocatalytic effects to promote the electrochemical reaction of the cathodic solidliquid/liquid-solid and the anodic solid-liquid conversions. By virtue of the multi-functional capabilities, the as-assembled cells equipped with the hybrid interlayer exhibit an outstanding electrochemical performance with a long cycling life, a low capacity decay (0.08% per cycle), and superior rate capability (493 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)). This work offers a new and efficient strategy to propel[ the development of high-performance Li-SeS2 batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The graphene sheets are well separated by TiNb2O7 (TNO) nanoparticles, and simultaneously, the TNO particles are uniformly anchored between the graphene sheets. The combined advantages of graphene sheets and TNO, such as the weight ratio and layered structure, exhibit tremendous benefits for high rate Li ion capability reaching around 180 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 38.7 A g(-1) (100C rate). Through the synergistic effects of their combination the total specific capacity of TNO/G is higher than the sum of the specific capacity of pure TNO and graphene in their relative ratios. For the study of Na ion capability, as graphene is an active material during the de-sodiation process, a reversible capacity of 340.2 mA h g(-1) was obtained from this TNO/G at a current density of 25 mA g(-1). Even at a higher current density of 200 mA g(-1), a stable capacity of 200 mA h g(-1) can still be obtained. These findings demonstrate the great potential of TNO/G for lithium/sodium ion anodes.

In this study, N and S dual-doped porous carbon was prepared by a facile strategy for using tribute chrysanthemum as precursor and zinc chloride as activating agent. The catalyst prepared at 800 degrees C (NSC800) depicts multiscale porous with large specific surface area (810 m(2) g(-1)) and abundant exposed intrinsic dopants. The electrochemical characterizations exhibit that its onset potential is 0.0966 V versus Hg/HgO electrode, much higher than that of the other reported N, S co-doped carbons, and it also shows the better methanol tolerance, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and stability than commercial Pt/C. Consequently, NSC800 catalyst shows attractive properties when used as the air cathode of a home-made primary aluminum-air battery, e.g., an open-circuit potential of ca. 1.64 V, a discharge specific capacity of 288 mAh g(-1), and a peak power density of 46 mW cm(-2). Such attractive performances could be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of exposed intrinsic N and S active sites and increased specific surface area with multiscale porous.

Because of its highly controllable composition and ordered porous structure, it has broad application prospects in the field of material synthesis. In this work, Zn-4(PYDC)(4)(DMF)(2)center dot 3DMF (ZPD) was synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Self-doped nitrogen porous carbon ZPDC-T was then prepared by one-step carbonization. The results show that the self-doped nitrogen porous carbon ZPDC-850 has a micro/mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 1520 m(2) g(-1) and a nitrogen content of 6.47%. When a current density is 1.0 A g(-1), its specific capacitance is 265.1 F g(-1). After 5000 times of constant current charging and discharging, the capacitance retention rate was 79.2%. Thus, self-doped nitrogen porous carbon ZPDC-850 exhibits excellent electrochemical properties and good cyclic stability. Therefore, the self-doped nitrogen porous carbon derived from MOFs can be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.

A key factor affecting acetylene yield is whether the residue solid carbon is able to react with hydrogen to form acetylene after volatile matters released from coal powders pyrolyzed in hydrogen plasma. Reactions of carbon in hydrogen plasma are studied in this article. The study showed that solid carbon could hardly react with hydrogen at temperatures below the sublimation point, while sublimated carbon could easily react with hydrogen at temperatures above sublimation point, and mainly acetylene and other hydrocarbons can be obtained after quenching process.

However, the search for and optimisation of a Li-metal-free full cell design remain relatively premature in terms of the generic synchronous approach to improve the anode/cathode stability while balancing the anode/cathode capacity. We hereby report a parallel interface engineering (PIE) strategy to enhance the full-cell performance of the Li-ion polysulphide battery. Very importantly, this PIE strategy allows the use of a Li-metal-free anode and a LiNO3-free electrolyte. The cell-level improvement is attributable to more efficient and uniform lithium sulphide deposition on the chemically uniform surfaces of the carbon cathode and suppressed growth of dendritic species on the Li-Al alloy anode with an implantable solid-electrolyte interphase. Quantitative electrochemical alloying for anode fabrication allows increased lithium utilization relative to the total anode capacity. The PIE strategy represents a facile approach to address the troublesome issues of Li-S batteries at the full cell level.

The composites were prepared by slip casting and liquid silicon infiltration. The bulk density is raised with the increase of carbon black due to the formation of fine beta-sic particles. The flexural strength increases for the reduction of residual Si and the formation of SiC framework; whereas a very high carbon content reduces the flexural strength. The fracture toughness is controlled by the contents of carbon particle and carbon fiber. Thus, fiber debonding, fiber pullout and crack deflection are considered as the main toughening mechanisms. Annealing treatment can effectively improve both the flexural strength and fracture toughness. An increase by 49% of fracture toughness is obtained. A series of structural models are proposed to illustrate the structure changes of carbon fiber. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The ab initio and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predict Li+ ion solvation structures within ether solvents in excellent agreement with experimental evidence from electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy. An excellent correlation is also established between the Li+-solvation binding energies from the ab initio MD simulations and the lithiation overpotentials obtained from galvanostatic intermittent titration techniques (GITT). These findings convincingly indicate that a stronger solvation binding energy imposes a higher lithiation overpotential of sulfur in subnano confinement. The mechanistic understanding achieved at the electronic and atomistic level of how Li+-solvation dictates its electrochemical reactions with sulfur in subnano confinement provides invaluable guidance in designing future electrolytes and electrodes for Li-sulfur chemistry.

Interface thermal transport of graphene-based intralayer heterostructures	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article							BORON-NITRIDE; CONDUCTIVITY; CONDUCTANCE; RECTIFICATION; SILICENE; DEFECTS	We have studied the effects of atomic mass (AM) and interatomic potential (IP) on the interface thermal transport of graphene-based intralayer heterostructures, composed of graphene (Gr) and graphene-like materials (Gx). We find that the phonon mismatch between Gx and Gr, induced by the variations of both AM and IP, leads to an obvious thermal resistance in such a hybrid heterostructure model device, following some scaling laws. Compared with that of graphene, the Kapitza resistance (R) of the hybrid heterostructure increases linearly (in power law) with the decrease (increase) of AM in Gx, whereas its variation with IP presents a contrary behavior. On the other hand, the effective interface thermal resistivity (r) increases parabolically (exponentially) with decreasing (increasing) AM and IP in Gx. We also find that the thermal rectification ratio can be effectively manipulated by the variation of AM and IP. Finally, we illustrate that the obtained scaling laws can be used to estimate r in real heterostructures. This study is expected to provide an efficient way to evaluate the interface effect on thermal transport, which have potential applications in design of high-performance heterostructure-based nanodevices.

Nevertheless, low conductivity and huge volume change leads to fast capacity fading, limiting its practical applications. Herein, continuous conductive carbon framework encapsulated Li3VO4(LVO-C) has been fabricated by using a facile ball-milling and calcination method. Owing to its unique structure, the intrinsic drawbacks of Li(3)VO(4)have been suppressed and the electrochemical performance has been enhanced. When used as an anode for LIBs, LVO-C exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate capability. The enhanced Li(+)storage properties could be ascribed to the continuous carbon framework and protected carbon layers, which accelerate electron transportation and avoid the aggregations of Li(3)VO(4)particles. This fabrication strategy provides insight into the mass production of advanced electrodes for LIBs.

In a separate study, it is shown that the fabricated carbonaceous architectures are useful as an excellent electrode material for lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and lithium-sulfur batteries. This article focuses on the study and analysis of the formed nanometer-sized by-products during the lab-scale synthesis of the carbon material. The material production process was studied in operando (that is, during the entire duration of heat treatment). The unknown downstream particles in the process exhaust were collected and characterized via aerosol and liquid suspensions, and they were quantified using direct-reading instruments for number and mass concentrations. The airborne emissions were collected using the Tsai diffusion sampler (TDS) for characterization and further analysis. Released by-product aerosols collected in a deionized (DI) water trap were analyzed, and the aerosols emitted from the post water-suspension were collected and characterized. After long-term sampling, individual particles in the nanometer size range were observed in the exhaust aerosol with layer-structured aggregates formed on the sampling substrate. Upon the characterization of the released aerosol by-products, methods were identified to mitigate possible human and environmental exposures upon industrial implementation.	[Tsai, Candace S.

The design of lithium plating host with unique nanostructure and lithiophilic surface has been proven to be one of the most efficient strategies to control Li plating/stripping process and inhibit lithium dendrite growth. Here we first report the fabrication of well-defined oxygen-rich carbon nanotube (O-CNT) network via a facile and scalable ultrafast "barbecue" approach. Remarkably, the asobtained three-dimensional (3D) O-CNT network electrode can serve as a promising Li-metal host with a low Li deposition overpotential and a flat voltage profile at various current densities, as well as long-term durability. The DFT calculation and experimental results further prove that the ketonic (C=O) group on CNT surface acts as efficient lithiophilic site to guide Li-metal nucleation and growth. In addition, the 3D porous network structure of O-CNT network with high conductivity facilitates electron and Li ions transport. Thus, this work provides a new strategy to construct high-performed Li-metal anodes toward high-performance Li-based batteries.

Thus, extensive effort has been devoted to the synthesis of nanostructured nickel and cobalt sulfides, and great promising progress has been achieved on their applications for efficient EESDs. In this review, we briefly introduce the most commonly used nickel and cobalt sulfides (e.g., CoS2, Co9S8, NiS, NiS2 and NiCo2S4) applied in various EESDs (e.g., battery-type supercapacitors, lithium/sodium-ion batteries, zinc-air batteries and lithium-sulfur batteries), and summarize a variety of nanostructures of nickel and cobalt sulfides developed in recent years and different methodologies for designing these nanostructures. Besides, nickel and cobalt sulfide-based composites combining the functions and advantages from carbon materials, conductive polymers or metal compounds are as well detailedly elaborated with considerable interest as active electrodes in EESDs. At last, we describe the existing problems and prospects of the nickel and cobalt sulfides as electrode materials in EESDs. More work should be dedicated to helping us make good use of nickel and cobalt sulfide-based electrode materials for EESDs in the near future.

The novel compound belongs to the family of sulfurized polyacrylonitrile compounds (SPAN) and was incorporated as active material in the cathode of Li-S batteries. The cells achieve high and stable capacity values at 0.5 C reaching 1885 mAh g s(-1) for the 10th cycle and similar to 1600 mAh g s(-1) after 200 cycles (498 and 422 mAh g(-1) composite, respectively). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to report the combination of SPAN and TiO2, and to show the synergistic behaviour of these compounds. The high capacity values observed, higher than the theoretical capacity of elemental sulfur (1675 mAh g(-1)), are explained by the extra capacity provided by the lithiation/delithiation process of TiO2. The metallic oxide also improves the overall kinetics of the redox processes in SPAN, which helped to achieve good cycling performance at 3.3 C, with a remaining capacity of 672 mAh g s(-1) after 1400 cycles, and even at 5 C where a remaining capacity of 660 mAh g s(-1) after 500 cycles was recorded.

In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to explore the transport of an ionic solution through asymmetric graphene channels under a pressure difference. We observe an interesting asymmetric desalination phenomenon when changing the channel geometry. Specifically, the fluxes of water and ions in the convergent direction are larger than those in the divergent direction; however, the salt rejection rates exhibit an opposite behavior. This is because the strong steric effect of the channel tip results in a direct ion rejection. Moreover, in the convergent transport direction, the ions can deposit inside the channel near the tip, resulting in an ion blockage effect that ultimately leads to an abnormal descending order of fluxes of water and ions with the channel size. The ion density peaks near the tip and the asymmetric occupancy distribution provide a direct validation for the ion blockage phenomenon. We also observed flux rectification for both water and ions, depending on the pressure and channel size. These results provide a fundamental understanding of the unique ionic transport in asymmetric graphene channels, which should have great implications for designing desalination devices.

The electrochemical loading with sodium ions is realized in a specific mixture of diethyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate, and fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte in order to create a first solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode surface. Combining such anodes with a porous carbon/sulfur composite cathode results in full cells with a significantly decreased polysulfide shuttle when compared to half cells combined with metallic sodium anodes. Further optimization involves the use of Na2S/P2S5 doped tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether based electrolyte in the full cell for the formation of a second SEI, reducing polysulfide shuttle even further. More importantly, the electrochemical discharge processes in the cell are improved by adding this dissolved complexation agent to the electrolyte. As a result of this combination sodium-sulfur cells with tailored cathode materials and electrolytes can achieve high discharge capacities up to 980 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) and 1000 cycles with 200 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) remaining capacity, at room temperature.

However, most of GQDs prepared by present methods have low oxidation degree, which could hinder the complexation between copper ions and oxygen functional groups on the surface of GQDs. Therefore, we proposed a universal, mild and in situ post-treated approach for modifying GQDs obtained by any methods, which will increase the oxidation degree of GQDs without any other affect and its influence on the responsivity of copper ions.

Finding accommodation material of Te is the key issue for Li-Te batteries. Here, rib-like hierarchical porous carbon (RHPC) derived from lotus seedpod as host for tellurium is synthesized by facile hydrothermal-pyrolyzation method. Benefiting from the effective accommodation of RHPC reservoir, together with the preeminent electronic conductivity of Te, this unique RHPC/Te electrode is able to deliver a reversible capacity of 288 mA h g(-1) (1797 mA h cm(-3)) at 2C and keep stability for a ultra-long cycling number as long as 3600 cycles, and could undergo a high current density of 10C and get capacity of 196 mA h g(-1) (1223 mA h cm(-3)), showing especially excellent performance for Li-Te batteries. We believe that the RHPC/Te electrode will exert great influence in Li-Te batteries. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

But, the materials in the battery systems mainly come from complex chemical process, accompanying with the inevitable serious pollutions and high energy-consumption. Natural mineral resources display various merits, such as unique architecture, adsorption capability and rich active sites, which have captured numerous atten-tions with remarkable advancements. Recently, the minerals compounds, containing 1D structure (halloysites, attapulgites, sepiolite), 2D structure (montmorillonite, vermiculite, molybdenite) and 3D structure (diatomite, pyrites), have been applied in plenty of fields. Aiming at their energy-storage applications, the significant utiliza-tions in electrodes, separators, electrolyte and metal-protection were detailedly reviewed in lithium-ions battery, lithium-sulfur battery, solid-state battery and so on. However, it should be acknowledged that, the simple minerals hardly meet the demand of energy-storage systems, due to their inferior conductivity and less active substances. Thus, series of modified manners are applied for the evolution of phase (from silicate mineral to Si), the incor-porating with carbon/polymer and the tailoring of surface traits, which were in-depth discussed as following. The work was expected to summarize the traits about mineral compounds from different architectures, whilst offering significant guidelines for exploring mineral-based materials in energy-storage systems.

Composite bone cement can improve some defects of calcium silicate biological bone material such as poor mechanical properties and lower cell activity. The results show that PEG-GO/V-C3S has satisfying curing ability, mechanical properties and high injectability. The compressive strength of composite bone cement has been improved significantly (35.24 % higher than that of pure V-C3S) and the pH environment is also better, so V-C3S containing 0.9 g/1 PEG-GO has better performance. Its extraordinary mineralization ability can be reflected in vitro immersion experiments. Cell experiments confirmed that compared with V-C3S and GO/V-C3S, it has lower cytotoxicity and higher cell proliferation ability. These results show that PEG-GO/V-C3S bone cement is a up-and coming material for biomaterials.

However, so far, metal fluoride cathodes have suffered from poor electronic conductivity, sluggish reaction kinetics and side reactions causing high voltage hysteresis, poor rate capability, and rapid capacity degradation upon cycling. Herein, it is reported that an FeF3@C composite having a 3D honeycomb architecture synthesized by a simple method may overcome these issues. The FeF3 nanoparticles (10-50 nm) are uniformly embedded in the 3D honeycomb carbon framework where the honeycomb walls and hexagonal-like channels provide sufficient pathways for the fast electron and Li-ion diffusion, respectively. As a result, the as-produced 3D honeycomb FeF3@C composite cathodes even with high areal FeF3 loadings of 2.2 and 5.3 mg cm(-2) offer unprecedented rate capability up to 100 C and remarkable cycle stability within 1000 cycles, displaying capacity retentions of 95%-100% within 200 cycles at various C rates, and approximate to 85% at 2C within 1000 cycles. The reported results demonstrate that the 3D honeycomb architecture is a powerful composite design for conversion-type metal fluorides to achieve excellent electrochemical performance in metal fluoride-lithium batteries.

J	Dai, HL; Xi, K; Liu, X; Lai, C; Zhang, SQ				Dai, Hongliu; Xi, Kai; Liu, Xin; Lai, Chao; Zhang, Shanqing			Cationic Surfactant-Based Electrolyte Additives for Uniform Lithium Deposition via Lithiophobic Repulsion Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ENERGY DENSITY; METAL ANODES; DOUBLE-LAYER; SULFUR; BATTERIES; COMPOSITE; ADSORPTION; CATHODE	Lithium metal is among the most promising anode materials for high-energy batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential. However, dendrite formation is a major challenge, which can result in fire and explosion of the batteries. Herein, we report on hexadecyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as an electrolyte additive that can suppress the growth of lithium dendrites by lithiophobic repulsion mechanisms. During the lithium plating process, cationic surfactant molecules can aggregate around protuberances via electrostatic attraction, forming a nonpolar lithiophobic protective outer layer, which drives the deposition of lithium ions to adjacent regions to produce dendrite-free uniform Li deposits. Thus, an excellent cycle of 300 h at 1.0 mA cm(-2) and rate performance up to 4 mA cm(-2) are available safely in symmetric LilLi cells. In particular, significantly enhanced cycle and rate performance were achieved when the electrolyte with CTAC additives was used in lithium-sulfur and LilLiNi(0.5)Co(0.2)Mn(0.3)O(2) full cells. The effects of carbon chains, anions of surfactant, and electrostatic repulsion on the deposition of lithium anodes are reported. This work advances research in inhibiting Li dendrite growth with a new electrolyte additive based on cationic surfactants.

Controlling Fluoride-Forming Reactions for Improved Rate Capability in Lithium-Perfluorinated Gas Conversion Batteries	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						anion receptors; gas conversion; lithium fluoride; lithium-gas batteries; rate capability	NONAQUEOUS LI-O-2; TRIS(PENTAFLUOROPHENYL) BORANE; CATALYTIC DISPROPORTIONATION; THERMAL-STABILITY; LI-CO2 BATTERIES; ANION RECEPTOR; ION BATTERIES; CO2 CAPTURE; ELECTROLYTE; DISCHARGE	Nonaqueous metal-gas batteries based on halogenated reactants exhibit strong potential for future high-energy electrochemical systems. The lithium-sulfur hexafluoride (Li-SF6) primary battery, which utilizes a safe, noncombustible, energy-dense gas as cathode, demonstrates attractive eight-electron transfer reduction during discharge and high attainable capacities (>3000 mAh g(carbon)(-1)) at voltages above 2.2 V-Li. However, improved rate capability is needed for practical applications. Here, two viable strategies are reported to achieve this by targeting the solubility of the passivating discharge product, lithium fluoride (LiF). Operating at moderately elevated temperatures, e.g., 50 degrees C, in DMSO dramatically improves LiF solubility and promotes sparser and larger LiF nuclei on gas diffusion layer electrodes, leading to capacity improvements of approximate to 10x at 120 mu A cm(-2). More aggressive chemical modification of the electrolyte by including a tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane anion receptor further promotes LiF solubilization; capacity increases even at room temperature by a factor of 25 at 120 mu A cm(-2), with attainable capacities up to 3 mAh cm(-2). This work shows that bulk fluoride-forming conversion reactions can be strongly manipulated by tuning the electrolyte environment to be solvating toward F-, and that significantly improved rates can be achieved, leading a step closer to practical applications.

Previous research has shown that photocatalytic oxidation is regarded as a promising technology to remove VOCs. However, for the time being, the photocatalytic performance in the field of removing VOCs by multiple reported photocatalysts cannot meet the demand of the practice. In this study, we have successfully synthesized a series of 3D gel composites with g-C3N4 (GC) and graphite oxide as precursors by a simple hydrothermal and freeze-drying method, which shows good photocatalytic degradation performance for gas toluene as model VOCs. The highest photocatalytic degradation ratio for gaseous toluene is about 86% in 180 min, which is about 3 times that of pure GC. The reason for the results is due to the strong adsorption capacity and very fast electrical conductivity of three dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (RGO). This study implies that the 3D GC-RGO gels have potential usefulness for removing VOCs to meet the demand of the practice.

Among all materials, the mechanical strength and electrochemical inertness of diamond is a prime candidate for lithium stabilization. Herein, we successfully rendered this desirable material compatible as lithium metal interface, which strictly satisfied the critical requirements. Our interface possessed the highest modulus among all the lithium coatings (>200 GPa), which can effectively arrest dendrite propagation. Since pinholes are the major failure mechanisms of artificial interfaces, a novel double-layer design was proposed to enhance the defect tolerance, enabling uniform ion flux and mechanical properties as confirmed by both simulation and experiments. Thanks to the multifold advantages of our interface design, high Coulombic efficiency of >99.4% was obtained at 1 mA cm(-2); and more than 400 stable cycles were realized in prototypical lithium-sulfur cells with limited lithium, corresponding to an average anode Coulombic efficiency of >99%.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and photocurrent patterns indicated that TiO2/PANI/graphene had an excellent photoelectrical response because the introduction of polyaniline (PANI) into the TiO2 system can promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Meanwhile, graphene can be used as an acceptor for photogenerated electrons in composites and can prevent carrier recombination and increase charge transfer. This hydrogel exhibits recyclability and excellent photo-electrocatalysis properties, which is attributed to the excellent photoelectric response properties of TiO2/PANI/graphene. The hydrogels with the best photocatalytic performance can degrade methyl orange and RhB more than 98% within 60 min and bisphenol A more than 97% within 150 min. Moreover, 88% degradation rate remained after five cycles for hydrogels, which indicated that the hydrogels had good cycling performance. The findings provide a new strategy for the construction of TiO2/PANI/graphene photocatalysts and pave an alternative way to the design and synthesis of recyclable hydrogel photocatalysts.

A photoanode with a three-layer structure is prepared in this study and the synergy between each layer was found to play a vital role in its photovoltaic properties. The influence of interface contact between the transport layer and work layer is revealed. After ameliorating the interface contact level (enhancing the electron transport ability), the functions of the adopted reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and three-dimensional graphene networks (3DGNs) in the transport layer and work layer, respectively, can be made full use of. In order to further enhance the scattering ability for the incident light and improve the adsorption ability for dye molecules, a scattering layer based on the RGO-TiO2 is added in the photoanode. After a comprehensive optimization (including the types of functional groups and mass fractions of the RGO in the work layer and scattering layer), the resulting power conversion efficiency reaches 11.8%, which is much higher than that of previous reported graphene modified DSSCs.

Herein, by using density-functional theory calculations, we show that N-doped olympicene/graphene hybrids exhibit unexpectedly high ORR catalytic activity-even comparable to that of the Pt(111) surface. Both graphitic-type and pyridine-type N-doped olympicene/graphene hybrids are highly active for the ORR and have good CO tolerance. The formation of the second H2O molecule is the rate-determining step for the ORR with the graphitic-type hybrid, whereas on the pyridine-type hybrid, it is the formation of OOH. Note that N-doped olympicene/graphene hybrid materials combine the high reactivity of olympicene and the high electrical conductivity of graphene, which allows them to be potentially used as low-cost and non-precious-metal ORR catalysts.

Results showed that CNTs were uniformly coated onto CF surface, and the surface chemical activity, wettability and single fiber tensile strength of modified CFs were all improved significantly. More importantly, the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of CF/CNTs reinforced epoxy composite, CF/CNTs composite, observed by SEM, showed good interface adhesion. It was also found that the silane coupling agent and CNTs would enhance the interfacial properties synergistically. Besides, the bridging effect of CNTs as the interfacial reinforcing mechanism for CF/CNTs multi-scale reinforcement composite was put forward. This special reinforcing mechanism may be as the guiding principle for CF surface modification and interfacial properties enhancement.

However, CO2 adsorption at 273 K indicates the presence of ultramicropores, not detected with N-2 at 77 K. Acidity was characterized by different procedures, but the most relevant was P-31 solid state NMR of adsorbed triethylphosphine oxide. The solvent used for the adsorption is crucial, as the solid seems not to be acidic in hexane, but it shows acidic groups comparable to arylsulfonic ones when the adsorption takes place in methanol. This is probably due to the breakage of the network of hydrogen bonds that forms the ultramicropores, leading to an improved accessibility to the sites. This result is in agreement with the hydrophilicity of the solid, demonstrated by water adsorption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, limited nucleation sites and nonuniform local electric field caused dendrites growth and unlimited volume expansion hindered their practical implementation during electrochemical plating/stripping. Herein, a 3D N-doped carbon nanofiber skeleton wrapped with Ni nanoparticles encapsulated carbon nanotubes (CNTsNi@NCFs) is prepared by hydrothermal process and followed catalytic reaction under ethanol atmosphere to construct a superior Li/Na-philic host with stable chemical properties. The 3D NCF networks serve as a primary framework, providing sufficient voids for alkali metal deposition and rapid electron and ion transport. The Li/Naphilic Ni nanoparticles and catalyzed CNTs on CFs provide evenly distributed nucleation sites and uniform local electric field, leading to dendrite-free Li deposition, which is confirmed by theoretical calculations. Because of the guided deposition behavior and bare volume change, the CNTs-Ni@NCFs anode delivers an extremely low nucleation overpotential in the initial deposition and a superior plating/stripping voltage hysteresis under a high current density of 30 mA cm-2 for 300 cycles. The CNTs-Ni@NCFs-Li full cell with LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrates 94.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles under 2 C. When coupled with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, the CNTsNi@NCFs-Na cell shows a good suitability in full cell. This work shed new light on fabricating novel stable alkali metal anodes, which may also pave the way toward to other practical applications with high energy densities, such as in Li-air and Li-S batteries, etc.	[Zeng, Wei; Zhang, Wenjing] Shenzhen Univ, Inst Microscale Optoelect, Minist Educ, Int Collaborat Lab 2D Mat Optoelect Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaojia; Yang, Chunyang; Hu, Jin; Zhao, Yanli; Zhang, Guanhua; Duan, Huigao] Hunan Univ, Coll Mech & Vehicle Engn, Natl Engn Res Ctr High Efficiency Grinding, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China; [Yang, Chunyang; Zhang, Chengzhi] Adv Mfg Sci & Technol GuangDong Lab, Foshan 528000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shi, Huimin] Guangzhou Univ, Adv Technol Ctr Special Equipment, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China		Zhang, WJ (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Inst Microscale Optoelect, Minist Educ, Int Collaborat Lab 2D Mat Optoelect Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.; Zhang, GH; Duan, HG (corresponding author), Hunan Univ, Coll Mech & Vehicle Engn, Natl Engn Res Ctr High Efficiency Grinding, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China.	wjzhang@szu.edu.cn; guanhuazhang@hnu.edu.cn; duanhg@hnu.edu.cn	Zhang, Guanhua/AAZ-9821-2021; Zhang, Chengzhi/G-7212-2019	Zhang, Chengzhi/0000-0002-2235-7313	National Natural Science Foundation of China [51472164, 51702095, 51722503]; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China [2018JJ3041]; Science and Technology Bureau Foundation of Changsha City [kh1904005]; Shenzhen Peacock Plan [KQTD2016053112042971]; Educational Commission of Guangdong Province [2015KGJHZ006]; 1000 Talents Program for Young Scientists of China	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province); Science and Technology Bureau Foundation of Changsha City; Shenzhen Peacock Plan; Educational Commission of Guangdong Province; 1000 Talents Program for Young Scientists of China	We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51702095, 51722503), Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China (Grant No. 2018JJ3041), Science and Technology Bureau Foundation of Changsha City (kh1904005), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51472164), the 1000 Talents Program for Young Scientists of China, Shenzhen Peacock Plan (KQTD2016053112042971), the Educational Commission of Guangdong Province (2015KGJHZ006).

Although larger size of graphene sheets has been fabricated, in reality, the existence of the defects in layered materials is almost inevitable during the manufacturing process. Here, we performed the state-of-the-art density-functional theory calculations to study the interactions between CO molecule and the pristine and defective graphene layers, with the aim of designing a CO gas sensor with higher sensitivity. The van der Waals interactions predominate the binding between the CO gas and the sensor, and also significantly enhance the stability of the system. The defective graphene strongly interacts with CO, and thus enhances the sensitivity of the graphene and further tunes the electronic and magnetic properties of the entire system. Our computed results clearly demonstrate that the defective graphene could be a good sensor for gas molecules.

Semiconducting properties of bilayer graphene modulated by an electric field for next-generation atomic-film electronics	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							LOGIC-CIRCUITS; TRANSPORT; CONDUCTANCE; BANDGAP	A practical wide bandgap was induced in bilayer graphene using a perpendicular electric field. A self-assembled gate insulator was used to apply a large electric field. The wide bandgap allows the operation of fundamental logic gates composed of bilayer graphene transistors.

In theory, an evanescent nonchiral edge state is predicted at the zigzag edges of graphene. Up to now, the approach used to study zigzag-edged graphene has mostly been limited to scanning tunneling microscopy. The transport properties have not been revealed. Recent advances in hydrogen plasma-assisted "top-down" fabrication of zigzag--edged graphene nanoribbons (Z-GNRs) have allowed us to investigate edge-related transport properties. In this Letter, we report the magnetotransport properties of Z-GNRs down to similar to 70 nm wide on an h-BN substrate, in the quantum Hall effect regime, a prominent conductance peak is observed at Landau nu = 0, which is absent in GNRs with nonzigzag edges. The conductance peak persists under perpendicular magnetic fields and low temperatures. At a zero magnetic field, a nonlocal voltage signal, evidenced by edge conduction, is detected. These prominent transport features are closely related to the observable density of states at the hydrogen--etched zigzag edge of graphene probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, which qualitatively matches the theoretically predicted electronic structure for zigzag--edged graphene. Our study gives important insights for the design of new edge-related electronic devices.

The VO2(B) nanobelts were well dispersed on the graphene layers as verified by scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements were adopted to investigate the electrochemical properties of VO2(B)/RG composites in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The VO2(B)/RG composites delivered better specific capacitance and superior rate capability in comparison with the pure VO2(B). The initial specific capacitance of the composites reached 290.4 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and maintained 82.3 % of the initial value after 1000 cycles at 2 A g(-1), 37.9 % higher than the pure VO2(B). Therefore, our results suggest that graphene greatly enhances the electrochemical performance of VO2(B) and VO2(B)/RG composite is a potential material for supercapacitor.

For these applications, good biosafety is a prerequisite for their use in vivo. Studies have reported the preliminary biocompatibility evaluations of fluorescent carbon dots (mainly cytotoxicity); however, to date, little information is available about their hemocompatibility, which could impede their development from laboratory to bedside. In this work, we evaluated the hemocompatibility of fluorescent carbon dots, which we prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of a-cyclodextrin. The effects of the carbon dots on the structure and function of key blood components were investigated at cellular and molecular levels. In particular, we considered the morphology and lysis of human red blood cells, the structure and conformation of the plasma protein fibrinogen, the complement activation, platelet activation, and in vitro and in vivo blood coagulation. We found that the carbon dots have obvious concentration-dependent effects on the blood components. Overall, concentrations of the fluorescent carbon dots at <= 0.1 mg/mL had few adverse effects on the blood components, but at higher doses, the carbon dots impair the structure and function of the blood components, causing morphological disruptions and lysis of red blood cells, interference in the local microenvironments of fibrinogen, activation of the complement system, and disturbances in the plasma and whole blood coagulation function in vitro. However, the carbon dots tend to activate platelets only at low concentrations. Intravenous administration of the carbon dots at doses up to 50 mg/kg did not impair the blood coagulation function. These results provide valuable information for the clinical application of fluorescent carbon dots.

Here, we prepared GQDs nanocomposites to amplify the ECL signals in tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II)/tripropylamine (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+ )/TPA) assay. Universal serial bus interface on smartphone was used as the excitation source for ECL. The luminescence signals were then captured by the smartphone camera and processed by a smartphone-based image analysis application (APP). By immobilizing layer of sensitive Escherichia coil (E.coli) antibody on the electrode surface, our smartphone-based ECL system exhibited excellent linear response towards detection of E.coli in the concentration range of 10 cfu/mL to 10(7) cfu/mL. Due to the vast popularity and portability of smartphone, the scope of application in our system would be able to greatly satisfy the need for point-of-care testing. Thus, in this work, the quantum dots-amplified luminescence detection was integrated with portable analytical devices, offering low-cost and real-time electrochemical analysis.

However, growth of Li dendrites, unstable solid electrolyte interphases, low Coulombic efficiencies, and safety hazards have significantly hindered the practical application of metallic Li anodes. Herein, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanotube sponge (CNTS) as a Li deposition host. The high specific surface area of the CNTS enables homogenous charge distribution for Li nucleation and minimizes the effective current density to overcome dendrite growth. An additional conformal Al2O3 layer on the CNTS coated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) robustly protects the Li metal electrode/electrolyte interface due to the good chemical stability and high mechanical strength of the layer. The Li@ ALD-CNTS electrode exhibits stable voltage profiles with a small overpotential ranging from 16 to 30 mV over 100 h of cycling at 1.0 mA.cm(-2). Moreover, the electrodes display a dendrite-free morphology after cycling and a Coulombic efficiency of 92.4% over 80 cycles at 1.0 mA.cm(-2) in an organic carbonate electrolyte, thus demonstrating electrochemical stability superior to that of planar current collectors. Our results provide an important strategy for the rational design of current collectors to obtain stable Li metal anodes.

As a popular electrochemical method, cyclic voltammetry (CV) has shown its great practicability for quantitative detection and electrodes modification. In this study, a smartphone-based CV system with a simple method of electrode modification was constructed to perform electrochemical detections. The system was composed of these main portions: modified electrodes, portable electrochemical detector and smartphone. Among them, the detector was comprised of an energy transformation module applying the stimuli signals, and a low-cost potentiostat module for CV measurements with a Bluetooth module for transmitting data and commands. With an Application (App), the smartphone was used as the controller and displayer of the system. Through controlling of different scan rates, the smartphone-based system could perform CV detections for redox couples with test errors less than 3.8% compared to that of commercial electrochemical workstation. Also, the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and sensitive substance could be modified by the system on the screen printed electrodes for detections. As a demonstration, 3-amino phenylboronic acid (APBA) was used as the sensitive substance to fabricate a glucose sensor. Finally, the experimental data of the system were shown the linear, sensitive, and specific responses to glucose at different doses, even in blood serum as low as about 0.026 mM with 3 delta/slope calculation. Thus, the system could show great potentials of detection and modification of electrodes in various fields, such as public health, water monitoring, and food quality.

In this paper, the amorphous structure of carbon, obtained by a numerical simulation process by using the molecular dynamic and Monte Carlo methods, as well as the primary unit method, was intercepted as a sphere structure for numerical annealing to build a carbon nanosphere, which serves as the basic unit to reconstruct the carbon aerogel's skeleton by the Diffusion Limited Cluster Aggregation (DLCA) method. The hydrogen adsorption in carbon aerogel was simulated by using the self-coding parallel grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method. The influences of particle diameter, density, temperature, pressure, and specific surface area on the hydrogen adsorbing capacity in carbon aerogel were analyzed in detail. The results showed that the carbon aerogel's hydrogen storage capacity with a specific surface area of 2680 m2/ g could reach 4.52 wt % at 77 K and 3.0 MPa. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Polyacrylates with carboxyl, hydroxyl and acylamino groups were synthesized via emulsion polymerization and marked as P(MMA-BA-AA), P(MMA-BA-HEA) and P(MMA-BA-AM), respectively. Amino-functionalized graphene oxide (NGO) was prepared by Hoffman rearrangement using GO as the raw material. The polyacrylate composites were prepared by mixing NGO with each of the three kinds of polyacrylate. Effects of pH and NGO amounts on the properties of polyacrylate composites were studied. It was found that the surface charge of polyacrylate and NGO had the greatest effect on the composite properties. P(MMA-BA-AM)/NGO was not stable at any pH (2-8). With the same NGO amount of 0.1 wt%, the toughening effect of NGO on P(MMA-BA-AA) was larger than that on P(MMA-BA-HEA). The break strength of P(MMA-BA-AA)/NGO and P(MMA-BA-HEA)/NGO increased to 5.22 MPa by 47% and 3.08 MPa by 31%, respectively. NGO could increase the thermal stability of P(MMA-BA-AA) and P(MMA-BA-HEA) to different degrees. The polyacrylate film-forming processes were tested, and it showed that NGO influenced polyacrylate through the whole film-forming process. The results provide potential methods for the design of polymer-based nanocomposites.

However, their high coefficients of friction (COFs) and poor wear resistance considerably limit their long-term performance in nanoscale contact. We report the fabrication of a MG/graphene multilayer by the repeated deposition of Cu50Zr50 MG with alternating layers of graphene. The microstructure of the multilayer was characterized by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Its mechanical and nanotribological properties were studied by nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests, respectively. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed that the addition of graphene endowed the MG with superelastic recovery, which reduced friction during nanoscratching. In comparison with the monolithic MG film, the multilayer exhibited improved wear resistance and a low COF in repeated nanowear tests owing to the enhanced mechanical properties and lubricating effect caused by the graphene layer. This work is expected to motivate the design of other novel MG films with excellent nanowear properties for engineering applications.

Here, we report a novel solvent evaporation method to align SWNTs in patterns having nanoscale width and micronscale length. SWNTs suspension has been introduced dropwise onto photoresist resin microchannels; and the capillary force can stretch and align SWNTs into strands with nanoscale width in the microchannels. Then these narrow and long aligned SWNTs patterns were successfully transferred to a pair of gold electrodes with different gaps to fabricate carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNTFET). Moreover, the electrical performance of the CNTFET show that the SWNTs strands can bridge different gaps and fabricate good electrical performance CAT-PET with ON/OFF ratio around 10(6). This result suggests a promising and simple strategy for assembling well-aligned SWNTs into CNTFET device with good electrical performance.

In this paper, we report a new approach for the synthesis of iron doped ordered mesoporous carbon materials with adjustable pore size using Fe-SBA-15 as hard template and boric acid as the pore expanding reagent. The pore size can be precisely adjusted by a step of 0.4 nm in the range of 36 nm. The carbonization temperature can be lowered to 773 K due to the catalytic role of the doped iron. The present approach is suitable for facile synthesis of metal imbedded porous carbon materials with tunable pore sizes.

J	Rosenberg, S; Hintennach, A				Rosenberg, Sarah; Hintennach, Andreas			Laser-printed lithium-sulphur micro-electrodes for Li/S batteries	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Laser transfer; lithium battery; sulphur; microwave	CARBON; REDUCTION; ELECTRODE; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; MECHANISM; ION	A novel path for the preparation of electrodes for lithium-sulphur cells was developed using a very fast laser-printing setup for the direct and dry i.e., solvent-free transfer of electrode materials onto the current collectors. Model electrodes could be prepared at very small dimensions enabling these batteries to be used even in portable small devices. The initial specific charge was remarkably high at about 1300 A h kg(-1) (relating to the active material content of the electrode) with a loss of specific charge of about 75% after about 400 cycles at 1C. In addition, the dry transfer technique has highly beneficial effects on the environmental sustainability and, therefore, supports the concept of the use of "green" power storage.

Herein, nanosheet MoS2+x/carbon [one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotube (CNT) or twodimensional (2D) graphene nanoplatelet (GNP)] heterostructures are prepared via a simple, one-step hydrothermal method, resulting in highelectrodes. In lithium-based batteries, an anionic S22--S2- redox system is demonstrated based on combined structural characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and in situ synchrotronbased X-ray absorption spectroscopy to elucidate the electrochemical behavior of the Mo and S centers. MoS2+x-GNP electrodes delivered 177 mAh/g (2.9 mAh/cm2) in the first cycle and 78 mAh/ g (1.3 mAh/cm2) after 100 cycles at a current of 3.2 mA/cm2, representing high capacities despite such a high material loading for a sulfur-equivalent system, with 44% capacity retention and good rate capability. Conversely, the MoS2+x-CNT heterostructure displayed lower capacity and more capacity fade at all rates, attributed to aggregation of the active and carbonaceous materials in these electrodes and poor access to MoS2+x edge sites, as visualized via 3D Raman mapping and electron microscopy. The significantly improved capacity retention of the MoS2+x-GNP system is attributed to the (i) morphology because the arrangement of the 2D MoS2+x nanosheets on the GNP substrate allows for edge sites with excess sulfur to be exposed, (ii) increased stability of the structure during cycling, and (iii) homogeneous dispersion of the active and carbonaceous materials, resulting in good electrical contact.

These can intrinsically regulate immunity by activating the innate immune system. Mannose receptors (MR), a subgroup of the C-type lectin superfamily, are abundantly expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells. These play a crucial role in identifying pathogens, presenting antigens, and maintaining internal environmental stability. Utilizing the specific recognition between mannose and antigen-presenting cells (APC) surface mannose receptors, the antigen-carrying capacity of mannose-modified CNTs can be improved. Accordingly, here, we synthesized the mannose-modified carbon nanotubes (M-MWCNT) and evaluated them as an antigen delivery system through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In vitro, M-MWCNT carrying large amounts of OVA were rapidly phagocytized by macrophages and promoted macrophage proliferation to facilitate cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6) secretion. In vivo, in mice, M-MWCNT induced the maturation of dendritic cells and increased the levels of antigen-specific antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b), and cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-6). Taken together, M-MWCNT could induce both humoral and cellular immune responses and thereby can be utilized as an efficient antigen-targeted delivery system.

However, Tebased batteries are quite new, raising fundamental questions regarding the electrochemistry of Te-based cathodes and holistic aspects of full-cell performance. This review begins with a critical discussion on Li-Te electrochemistry in carbonate and ether electrolytes, followed by a comprehensive review on material design, cell architectures, and the working mechanism of Te-based cathodes in Li-Te-based batteries. The primary focus is to develop a fundamental understanding of the Te structure's role, carbon host chemistry and porosity, and the use of electrolytes to address Te pulverization and parasitic polytellurides shuttle effects and to establish reversible Te and Li2Te phase transitions. In addition, liquid and solid-state electrolytes for Li-Te batteries showing promise of enabling a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and reversible Te cathode reactions are presented. The following section exemplifies other novel metal-Te based batteries, including Na-Te, K-Te, Mg-Te, Zn-Te, and Al-Te systems, highlighting their respective cathode and electrolyte selection. Then, the comparison of quantitative performance data of various metal-Te-based batteries across Li-ion and Li-S batteries is revealed to provide a landscape of current research. In closing, this work identifies unanswered scientific and technological questions, discusses promising research directions, and highlights the experimental and simulation-based studies needed to discover the unknown of rechargeable Te-based batteries.

Using commercial cost-effective AlSi alloy nanopowder as the silicon source, here we present a facile approach via pre-template-coating and chemical acid etching methods for synthesizing silicon/porous nitrogen-doped carbon composite with a unique core-porous shell structure. At the pre-template-coating stage, the AlSi alloy nanopowder is initially coated by carbon via the solution deposition and carbonization of PVP. The Al template is subsequently removed by acid etching, affording silicon nanoparticles wrapped by the highly conductive nitrogen-doped carbon. The escape of hydrogen gas during acid etching leads to the nitrogen-doped carbon shell with a microporous structure. The silicon/porous nitrogen-doped carbon composite with 88% Si delivers a high reversible capacity of 1730 mAh g(-1) (based on the total mass of the composite) after 100 cycles at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%. Moreover, the rate capability is significantly improved. With the increase in the current density from 200 to 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 mA g(-1), high capacity retention values of 99.7, 97.5, 93.7 and 91.5%, respectively, are obtained. A long cycle life at a high rate is also achieved, with a notable capacity of 665 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles at a high current density of 5000 mA g(-1). The low-cost, facile, and scalable synthesis of the approach silicon/porous nitrogen-doped carbon composite with exceptional electrochemical performance from a commercial AlSi alloy powder makes it extremely promising as a practical anode material for highenergy Li-ion batteries.

The rapid progress of SIBs research is primarily focused on electrodes, while electrolytes attract less attention. Indeed, the improvement of electrode performance is arguably correlated with the electrolyte optimization. In conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), ether-based electrolytes are historically less practical owing to the insufficient passivation of both anodes and cathodes. As an important class of aprotic electrolytes, ethers have revived with the emerging lithium-sulfur and lithium-oxygen batteries in recent years, and are even booming in the wave of SIBs. Ether-based electrolytes are unique to enabling these new battery chemistries in terms of producing stable ternary graphite intercalation compounds, modifying anode solid electrolyte interphases, reducing the solubility of intermediates, and decreasing polarization. Better still, ether-based electrolytes are compatible with specific inorganic cathodes and could catalyze the assembly of full SIBs prototypes. This Research News article aims to summarize the recent critical reports on ether-based electrolytes in sodium-based batteries, to unveil the uniqueness of ether-based electrolytes to advancing diverse electrode materials, and to shed light on the viability and challenges of ether-based electrolytes in future sodium-based battery chemistries.

Here we collected filter-based PM2.5 samples during summer and autumn in 2015 at one urban and two rural sites in Guangzhou, a megacity in southern China, and got the light absorption by black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) resolved with a DRI Model 2015 multi-wavelength thermal/optical carbon analyzer apart from determining the organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) contents. On average BrC contributed 12-15% of the measured absorption at 405 nm (LA(405)) during summer and 15-19% during autumn with significant increase in the LA(405) by BrC at the rural sites. Carbonaceous aerosols, identified as total carbon (TC), yielded average mass absorption efficiency at 405 nm (MAE(405)) that were approximately 45% higher in autumn than in summer, an 83% increase was noted in the average MAE(405) for OC, compared with an increase of only 14% in the average MAE(405) for EC. The LA(405) by BrC showed a good correlation (p < 0.001) with the ratios of secondary OC to PM2.5 in summer. However, this correlation was poor (p > 0.1) in autumn, implying greater secondary formation of BrC in summer. The correlations between levoglucosan (a marker of biomass burning) and the LA(405) by BrC were significant during autumn but insignificant during summer, suggesting that the observed increase in the LA(405) by BrC during autumn in rural areas was largely related to biomass burning. The measurements of light absorption at 550 nm presented in this study indicated that the use of the IMPROVE algorithm with an MAE value of 10 m(2)/g for EC to approximate light absorption may be appropriate in areas not strongly affected by fossil fuel combustion; however, this practice would underestimate the absorption of light by PM2.5 in areas heavily affected by vehicle exhausts and coal burning.

Rectifying behavior in nitrogen-doped zigzag single-walled carbon nanotube junctions	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Carbon nanotube; Electronic transport; Rectifying	NEGATIVE DIFFERENTIAL RESISTANCE; TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; DEVICES; MICROTUBULES; CONDUCTANCE	Using first-principles density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism for quantum transport calculation, we have investigated the electronic transport properties of (8,0), (9,0) and (13,0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotube junctions with one undoped and one nitrogen-doped zigzag carbon nanotube electrode. Our results show that the transport properties are strongly dependent on the magnitude of energy gap of carbon nanotube. Large rectifying behavior can be obtained in the junction with large energy gap. The observed rectifying behavior are explained in terms of the evolution of the transmission spectra and energy band structures with applied bias voltage combined with molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian eigenstates analysis.

Based on the continuum theory, one physical model is established for a double-clamped single layer rectangular graphene film and the relation between the centerline deflection and the concentrated force has been derived. During MD simulations, the Airebo potential is utilized to describe the C-C atomic interactions of graphene, and the concentrated radial forces were exerted on the centerline of a graphene nanoribbon. After the simulations, a set of Young's moduli is calculated based on the presented relation between the centerline deflection and the concentrated force, with an average value of 1.034 TPa, and the maximum stress of graphene is also obtained as 137.09 GPa.

The rGO-PAA is both simple and starts from readily available graphite and PAA, thereby providing a scalable fabrication procedure. The scaffold can support as much as a 75 mg/cm(2) loading of LiFePO4 (LFP) in a similar to 430 mu m thick layer, and the porosity of the aerogel is tunable by compression; the flexible aerogel can be compressed 30-fold (i.e., to as little as 3.3% of its initial volume) while retaining its mechanical integrity. Replacement of the Al foil by the rGO-PAA current collector of the slurry-cast LFP (1.45 +/- 0.2 g/cm(3) tap density) provides for exemplary mass loadings of 9 mg(LFp)/cm(2) at 70 mu m thickness and 1.4 g/cm(3) density or 16 mg(LFP)/cm(2) at 100 mu m thickness and similar to 1.6 g/cm(3) density. When compared to Al foil, the distribution of LFP throughout the three-dimensional rGO-PAA. framework doubles the effective LFP solution-contacted area at 9 mg/cm(2) loading and increases it 2.5-fold at 16 mg/cm(2) loading. Overall, the rGO-PAA. current collector increases the volumetric capacity by increasing the effective electrode area without compromising the electrode density, which was compromised in past research where the effective electrode area has been increased by reducing the particle size.

It attempts to minimize the carbon emission of power grid, power loss, and the voltage deviation by taking the reactive power control of aluminum plants into account. Since the presented OCECF is a nonlinear and complex optimization problem, a new metaheuristic algorithm called Coot algorithm is employed to acquire a high-quality dispatch solution under various scenarios. The Coot algorithm is inspired by the movement of birds on the water surface, which can implement a wide exploration via the random movement and a deep exploitation via the chain movement with the group leaders. The performance of Coot algorithm for the presented OCECF is carried out on an IEEE 57-bus system with various power plants, in which the group search optimizer is introduced for performance comparison.

MXene is prepared by acid etching a MAX phase, and then nanocomposites of MoS2 decorated on Ti3C2 MXene (MoS2@Ti3C2) are synthesized using a simple solid state sintering method. The electrochemical properties of the MoS2@Ti3C2 nanocomposites were investigated to assess the use of these nanocomposites as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The MoS2@Ti3C2 nanocomposites have a reversible discharge capacity of 131.6 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1) for 200 cycles, significantly higher than that of pure Ti3C2 and MoS2, which is 58 mAh g(-1) and 3.6 mAh g(-1). The MoS2@Ti3C2 nanocomposites exhibit excellent cycling stability. The better electrochemical performance is attributed to the MoS2 nanoparticles grown on the layer of MXene, which shortens the charge transfer distance and improves the charge transfer rate during the electrochemical reaction.

Based on the electrochemical reaction difference between lithium and anodes/cathodes, a series of lithium based energy storage systems, including lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, lithium-ion capacitors and lithium-oxygen batteries, have been developed and inspired increasing research enthusiasm due to their efficient energy storage features. However, from their current development status, there remains an enormous gap in energy/power density, durability and safety issues between the practical and theoretical performance. Fortunately, 2D nanomaterials, which have been widely applied in lithium-based energy storage systems due to some unique physical/chemical properties, are gradually closing the gap. Therefore, the synthesis approaches for targeting 2D nanomaterials with controlled qualities will be of great significance in this field. On the other hand, for better addressing some stubborn issues during the application, it is necessary to modify 2D nanomaterials by some effective functionalization strategies. In this review, we summarize the general synthesis approaches of 2D nanomaterials as well as functionalization strategies for high-performance lithium-based energy storage systems.

Utilizing low-cost and eco-friendly leather wastes as precursors, herein a carbon aerogel with rich N, O and S doping has been constructed by a one-step activated pyrolysis process. Distortional carbon nanocrystallites (DCNs) in the material and its self hetero-doping could provide uneven surface charge distributions, thus improving both the electronic and ions conductivities, as well as water wettability of the electrode. Besides, the defects from its structure and doping could also act as active sites, boosting the adsorption capacity. In addition, the obtained aerogel exhibits a specific surface area of as high as 2523 m(2) g(-1) with abundant micropores, which is also favorable to salt ions storage. Therefore, CDI cell comprised of the carbon aerogel electrodes exhibits a maximum salt adsorption capacity (mSAC) of 20.92 mg g(-1) and a significantly higher average salt adsorption rate (ASAR) in comparison with commercial active carbon.

Improved mechanical properties in titanium matrix composites reinforced with quasi-continuously networked graphene nanosheets and in-situ formed carbides	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Titanium matrix composites (TMCs); Graphene; Network structure; Strength; Ductility	SUPERIOR TENSILE PROPERTIES; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOCOMPOSITES; STRENGTH; TI-6AL-4V; EVOLUTION; DUCTILITY; OXIDE	In order to construct quasi-continuously networked reinforcement in titanium (Ti) matrix composites, in this study, Ti-6Al-4V spherical powders were uniformly coated with a graphene nanosheet (GNS) layer by high energy ball milling and then consolidated by spark plasma sintering. Results showed that the GNS layer on the powder surface inhibited continuous metallurgy bonding between powders during sintering, which led to the formation of quasi-networked hybrid reinforcement structure consisting of insitu TiC and remained GNSs. The networked GNSs/Ti64 composite possessed noticeably higher tensile strength but similar ductility to the Ti64 alloy, leading to both better tensile strength and ductility than the GNSs/Ti composite with randomly dispersed GNSs and TiC. The formation mechanism and the fracture mechanism of the networked hybrid reinforcement were discussed. The results provided a method to fabricate Ti matrix composites with high strength and good ductility.

Ga2O3, an emerging ultrawide band gap semiconductor, is considered as the native photosensitive material for solar-blind PDs. The reported fabrication temperature of Ga2O3 films is usually above 600 degrees C, which hinders its practical application for flexible devices. In this work, flexible PDs based on graphene/amorphous Ga2O3 van der Waals heterojunctions are fabricated, which demonstrate promising photoresponse to solar-blind ultraviolet light. The device yields a high photo-to-dark current ratio (similar to 10(5)) and large responsivity (22.75 A/W) under 254 nm light illumination, which could be ascribed to the efficient photogenerated electron-hole pair separation by the strong built-in field. Moreover, flexible PDs also show long-term environmental stability and outstanding mechanical flexibility without any encapsulation. Our work provides a new potential candidate for realizing cost-effective high-performance flexible optoelectronic applications.

The core-shell carbon black (CSCB) nanoparticles could be selectively separated by the reactive extrusion process or warm aging under the effect of swelling. The microstructures of CSCB were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicated that the core of CSCB was composed of the carbon black and the shell was made up of the bound rubber which could not be extracted by solvent. In addition, the reinforcing effect of the CSCB in natural rubber (NR) was studied by tensile test. The results showed that the CSCB had higher interfacial interaction with the rubber chains and a new layer of reinforced bound rubber was formed.

Interactions between the composites and amino acids were investigated by both naked-eye observation and optical absorption spectroscopy. The GO/GNPs composites displayed apparent color changes and absorption spectra changes in presences of amino acids including glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine. The interaction mechanisms of the composites and amino acids were discussed and explored with sulfhydryl groups and non-alpha-carboxylic groups on the amino acids. Sensing properties of the composites were tested, while pure gold particles were used as the control. The results suggested that the GO/GNPs composites had better linearity and stability in dose-dependent responses to the amino acids than those of the particles, especially in detections for acidic amino acids. Therefore, the nanocomposites platform can provide a convenient and efficient approach for label-free optical detections of important molecules such as amino acids. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

According to the Andreas's study, when the exciting wavelength falls in electron absorption band, it will produce the resonance Raman effect and the Raman intensity can enhance 10(6) times. The Raman spectra of different parts of the carrot, white radish and green radish and the beta-carotene are measured by using the resonance Raman spectroscopy, finding that the Raman spectra of carrot match well with beta-carotene due to a high beta-carotene content in carrots. Studies from Gellerman et al. show that the sample concentration is directly proportional to Raman peak intensity, which is clearly seen from the beta-carotene Raman spectrum: the Raman intensity of three kinds of radish vertical root head to taproot and lateral skin to core gradually decrease, and the Raman intensity of C-C of the green and white radishes are lower and occur peak splitting. Calculating to intensity ratio of carbon-carbon single and double bonds to the carbon-hydrogen (C-H), the variation rates of I-c=c/IC-H of different measuring parts (horizontal and vertical) of three kind radish are close: the rates of change of epidermis and root core of carrot are A(1)=0. 213 3 and A(2)=0. 215 9, and the outside and inside of green radish are B-1=0.219 1 and B-2=0.211 4, and the outside and inside of white radish are D-1=0.223 9 and D-2=0.224 1; However, variation rates of Ic-c/IC-H with the different measuring parts are greatly different: the carrot are a(1)=0.212 1 and a(2)=0.232 4, and the green radish are b(1)=0.263 5 and b(2)=0.268 7, and the white radish are d(1)=0.369 0 and d(2)=0.304 9. It is found that Raman intensity ratios of C-C to the C-H of three kinds with the different parts are greatly different, but the ratios of C=C to C-H has similar distribution. This is due to the low levels of p-carotene in green and white radishes, the vibrational peak of C-C occurs peak splitting, namely, two vibrational peaks appear at 1 130 and 1 156 cm(-1). As the amount of p-carotene decrease, the intensity of C-C peak reduces, and the intensity of new peak is induce, making the peak intensity of the original peak greatly reduce. This is consistent with the results of IC-C/IC-H. Therefore, using the Raman intensity of C=C to analyze the beta-carotene content of different parts is more accurately. Furthermore, studies of the content of the beta-carotene in different parts of radish can help to provide a good theoretical basis for daily consumption and dietary nutrition.

The four models include three microporous structures with micropore sizes of 9-11 angstrom, 10-12 angstrom, and 13-16 angstrom, respectively, and one microporous-mesoporous structure with pore sizes of 15-17 angstrom and 21-24 angstrom. The microporous-mesoporous structure was easily adjusted by the introduction and deletion of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs, 15, 15). The adsorption of benzene on different structure models at temperatures of 273.15, 288.15, 303.15 and 318.15 K were studied by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods. Adsorption isotherms, average isosteric heats of benzene adsorption, porosity and pore volume change after benzene adsorption at different temperatures were analyzed. The radial distribution function, relative concentration distributions and diffusion coefficients of benzene molecules on different structure models were further studied. Comprehensive analysis results indicate that for low temperature, activated carbon with larger micropores and mesopores is favorable to adsorption of benzene. But for high temperature, activated carbon with smaller micropores is favorable to adsorption of benzene.

Enhanced hydrogen sensing properties of graphene by introducing a mono-atom-vacancy	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							DISSOCIATIVE ADSORPTION; 1ST PRINCIPLES; SENSOR; GAS; H-2; FABRICATION; MOLECULES; PATHWAYS; NANOTUBE	To facilitate the dissociative adsorption of H-2 molecules on pristine graphene, the addition of a mono-atom-vacancy to graphene is proposed. This leads to reduction of the dissociative energy barrier for a H-2 molecule on graphene from 3.097 to 0.805 eV for the first H-2 and 0.869 eV for the second, according to first principles calculations. As a result, two H-2 molecules can be easily dissociatively adsorbed on this defected graphene at room temperature. The electronic structure and conductivity of the graphene change significantly after H-2 adsorption. In addition, the related dissociative adsorption phase diagrams under different temperatures and partial pressures show that this dissociative adsorption at room temperature is very sensitive (10(-35) mol L-1). Therefore, this defected graphene is promising for ultra-sensitive room temperature hydrogen sensing.	[Jiang, Q. G.; Zheng, W.

Meanwhile, PANI nanowires are synthesized by in situ polymerization of aniline monomers. Importantly, many nanoscale holes are generated on the RGO nanosheets forming three-dimensional channels for ion transportation within the obtained composite material. LiPSs can be firmly confined in the composite material by the polar oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the RGO shells and the protonated nitrogen-containing groups on the PANI nanowires. Benefiting from the unique structure, the S@RGO/PANI particles exhibit an improved electrochemical performance. It can deliver an initial capacity of 1021 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.1C rate and a high initial coulombic efficiency up to 95.4%. Even at 2.0C rate, a discharge capacity of 501 mAh center dot g(-1) can be retained after 500 cycles. Results indicate that the S@RGO/PANI can be promisingly exploited as a kind of high-energy density cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries.

One of the most promising ways to improve the morphological and electrochemical properties of SPEs is the addition of fillers with specific nanostructures. However, the production of such fillers is generally expensive and requires complicated preparation procedures. Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), with their tubular structure, resemble carbon nanotubes in terms of geometric features and can be obtained at a relatively low cost. Previously, we reported that the HNT poly(ethylene oxide) composite SPE possesses excellent electrochemical and mechanical properties and outstanding cycling performance for all-solid-state lithium sulfur batteries. However, the HNT/SPE was not effective for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. The compatibility between the electrodes and the electrolyte sharply decreased, and no decent cycling performance was achieved. Therefore, a modification was studied which involves a minor addition of LFP during the preparation procedure. With this modification, good ionic conductivity (9.23 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C) is achieved, and compatibility between the electrodes and the electrolyte is enhanced. At the same time, an electrochemical stability window of 5.14 V and lithium-ion transference number of 0.46 are found. All-solid-state LFP batteries possessing excellent cycling performance are further demonstrated.

Double-coated tape-cast microscale AlF3 on polypropylene (AlF3@PP) yields state-of-the-art electrochemical performance: symmetric cells are stable after 1000 cycles (2000 h) at 0.5 mA cm(-2) and 0.5 mAh cm(-2), with 0.042 V overpotential. Stability is maintained at 5.0 mA cm(-2) for 600 cycles (240 h), with 0.138 V overpotential. Postcycled plated surface is dendrite-free, while stripped surface contains smooth solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional PP cells fail rapidly, with dendrites at plating, and "dead metal" and SEI clumps at stripping. Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) cathode KMBs with AlF3@PP display enhanced capacity retention (91% at 100 cycles vs 58%). AlF3 partially reacts with K to form an artificial SEI containing KF, AlF3, and Al2O3 phases. The AlF3@PP promotes complete electrolyte wetting and enhances uptake, improves ion conductivity, and increases ion transference number. The higher of K+ transference number is ascribed to the strong interaction between AlF3 and FSI- anions, as revealed through F-19 NMR. The enhancement in wetting and performance is general, being demonstrated with ester- and ether-based solvents, with K-, Na-, or Li- salts, and with different commercial separators. In full batteries, AlF3 prevents Fe crossover and cycling-induced cathode pulverization.

Subsequently, perturbations in terrestrial carbon sink alter atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and influence future climate change. Here, we use a regional climate model, RegCM4, coupled with the Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere model (YIBs) to assess the effects of the current aerosol loading on terrestrial carbon fluxes and atmospheric CO2 concentrations during 2006-2015 over China. We found that aerosols enhance gross primary production (GPP) by 0.36 Pg C yr(-1) (5%), which primarily stems from Southwest and Southeast China. Meanwhile, the aerosol-induced diffuse fraction (DF) increase, surface cooling and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) decrease together lead to a - 0.06 Pg C yr(-1) (21%) reduction in the net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Among them, aerosol-induced DF increment is found to be the dominant contributor, which covers similar to 59-62% of China's land area. The effects of aerosols on GPP and NEE are more evident in the growing season, with maximum effects occurring in July and August, respectively. Moreover, the terrestrial carbon sink enhancement due to aerosols further results in a significant decline in CO2 concentrations, with a large reduction (> 2 ppm) found in southern and eastern parts of China during the summer. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the interactions among aerosol pollution, climate change, and the global carbon cycle.

The higher concentration of Li salt in the electrolytes greatly improves Se utilization and cell cycle stability. Se-CDC shows significantly better performance characteristics than Se-activated carbon nanocomposites with similar physical properties. Se-CDC also exhibits better rate performance and cycle stability compared to similarly produced sulfur (S)CDC for Li/S batteries.

Herein, we report a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study on the investigation of surfactant adsorption and induced colloidal stability onto different SWCNTs. The surfactant-based encapsulation system, originating from the complementary pi-pi stacking, is validated through two-dimensional number density maps. We find that the asymmetric pyrenyl-gemini surfactants (APGSs) form double-layer assembled architecture films on nanotube surface. The inner layers of the films are packed with the pyrenyl groups of APGSs, which interact with SWCNTs via pi-pi stacking, while the outer layers composed of alkyl chains of APGSs coat at the nanotube surface through van der Waals interactions. In addition, we observe a configurational transformation of APGSs on the SWCNT surface from the folding configuration to unfolding patterns, when increasing the nanotube radius or the surface coverage of APGSs. Our study provides helpful insights into the encapsulation mechanism of APGSs on the SWCNT surface and the design of highly selective dispersants for SWCNTs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A junction made of a narrower AGNR sandwiched between two wider AGNR leads was recently reported to possess two perfect transmission channels close to the Fermi level. Here, we report that by using a bias voltage to drive these transmission channels into the gap of the wider AGNR lead, we can obtain a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect. Owing to the intrinsic properties of the AGNR junctions, the on-set bias reaches as low as similar to 0.2V and the valley current almost vanishes. We further show that such NDR effect is robust against details of the atomic structure of the junction, substrate, and whether the junction is made by etching or by hydrogenation.

Using experimental data on different conditions of the Li/Na-S batteries, taken from literature, it is established that the inverse value of obtained capacity is changing linearly with respect to square root of the corresponding applied current rate. The theoretical-based relationship has been established for the Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Therefore, this paper proposes similar behavior for the conversion and intercalation batteries. The proposed relationship and its beyond approach proffer estimations of: alteration of capacity by rate, optimal cathode mass, corresponding reaction components, and fraction of (in)active particles. Also, they offer a quantitative criterion for performance and rate-capability, the capability to justify observed phenomena, and also qualification of the powder, preparation, and assembling of the cell.

SOC was observed to be related to soil geochemistry, and soils originating from different bedrocks have different geochemical properties, but the effect of bedrock on SOC is still undefined. Soils overlying different bedrocks in Zhenxiong County and Weixin County were sampled. Specifically, soils in the mineral horizon, which are less affected by the external environment than surface soils, are focused on to reveal the effect of bedrock on SOC. Al/Ti, Fe/Ti, and Al/Fe indicate a soil-rock successive relationship. SOC contents in the mineral horizon are 0.19-2.74% (1.24% on average), and those in the surface horizon are 1.26-4.01% (2.63% on average). SOC contents in the surface and mineral horizons of the same bedrock are significantly positively correlated, implying that the bedrock is an important factor affecting SOC. SOC in the mineral horizon is related to the first transition metal ions. Significantly, positive correlations of SOC (p < 0.01) with Co, Cu, Ti, V, and Zn, and a positive correlation (p < 0.05) with Ni were observed in the mineral horizon. Organic transition metal complexation seems to play an important role in governing SOC in the mineral horizon. That is, the complexation maintains organic carbon stability, slows down its decomposition rate, and accumulates organic carbon. The Ca-SOC positive correlation in the mineral horizon exits because Ca also can complex with organic carbon. Co, Cu, and V-SOC positive correlations (p < 0.05) were also observed, but there were no significant positive correlations (p < 0.01) in the surface horizon because surface SOC had diversified sources. An SOC evolution model influenced by the bedrock was forwarded. Thus, the different soil geochemistry originating from different bedrocks should be noticed when SOC and global carbon cycles are discussed.

However, Li dendrite growth and corresponding poor cyclability still obstruct the practical use of Li metal anodes. Here, we report the yolk shell structured zinc oxide/carbon sphere coated polyethylene separator (ZnO/C@SE) to suppress Li dendrite growth and improve the cycle life of Li metal anodes. Initially ZnO could be lithiated first to form LiZn and Li2O. The lithiated ZnO and carbon layer on a polyethylene separator not only enables uniform surface current flows at an interface between a Li metal anode and an electrolyte, but also efficiently utilizes electrochemically inactive "dead" Li. With those synergistic advantages, Li could be deposited with dendrite-free morphology with the areal capacity up to 5 mAh cm(-2). The Li parallel to Cu cell with ZnO/C@SE shows outstanding performance even at a high current density of 2 mA cm(-2) with a high capacity of 2 mAh cm(-2) over 100 cycles. Furthermore, the Li-S battery with the ZnO/C@SE exhibits significant improvement in cycle performance at 0.2 C over 300 cycles. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, coupled in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography analyses are performed during the 1st and 11th cycles of a sulfur-based electrode made with poly(diallyldimethylammonium) bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)-imide as a polyelectrolyte binder. Sulfur deposited at the end of the 1st charge is mainly beta-S-8, but some alpha-S-8 is also deposited during the 1st charge on the unreacted alpha-S-8 particles. No alpha-S-8 is detected at the 11th cycle, suggesting that the remaining alpha-S-8 reacts progressively with cycling. The carbon-binder domain is not discernible due to spatial and contrast resolution limitations, and thus, its evolution with cycling and its specific role on the sulfur dissolution and deposition processes cannot be clearly established. However, the fact that there is no collapsing of the electrode in the sulfur-depleted zones (in contrast to what was observed in the literature with a conventional binder such as poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVdF)) suggests that the present polyelectrolyte is an efficient binder to preserve the electrode architecture upon cycling.

SEM and TEM observations confirmed the successful synthesis of this specially designed nanostructure, in which the conductive substrate ensures very fast electron transfer during the charge-discharge process, whereas the 3D hierarchical structure facilitates rapid ion transfer. The ultrathin LDH nanoflakes (3-5 nm) expose their abundant active sites to the electrolyte, thus generating huge pseudocapacitance. Combining the abovementioned features, this specially designed 3D nanostructured hybrid possesses an exceptional specific capacitance (2395 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), excellent rate performance (retaining 71.8% of capacitance at the current density of 20 A g(-1)), and remarkable cycling stability (99.6% retention after 10 000 cycles). Moreover, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor obtained using GP@LDH as a positive electrode and GP-derived carbon as a negative electrode exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 94.4 W h kg(-1) at the power density of 463.1 W kg(-1), making GP@LDH very attractive as an electrode material for high performance and low-cost supercapacitors.

As the polymeric template for the fabrication of mesoporous silicates, modified P123 greatly improved the affinity between the nanosheet and the in situ formed MCFs, resulting in the formation of thin layers of MCFs on both sides of rGO. Therefore, the MCFs@rGO formed exhibited a unique sandwich structure with an inner skeleton of rGO and two outer layers of MCFs. The outer modification by MCFs, with the presence of large mesopores, not only shifted the surface property of rGO from hydrophobic to hydrophilic but also offered immobilized enzymes a favorable microenvironment to maintain their bioactivity. Meanwhile, the inner skeleton of rGO compensated for the weak conductivity of MCFs, providing a pathway for the direct electron transfer (DET) of various redox enzymes or proteins, such as hemoglobin (Hb), horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase (GOD), and cholesterol oxidase. It was found that the DET signal obtained from Hb-MCFs@rGO/glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was much larger than the sum of the signals from two components-based modified electrodes of Hb-P123-rGO/GCE and Hb-MCFs/GCE. A similar improvement in DET signal was also observed using GOD-MCFs@rGO/GCE. The significant enhancement of DET signals for both protein electrodes can be ascribed to the synergistic effects generated from the integration of the two components, one of which enhances biocompatibility and the other enhances conductivity. The bioelectrocatalytic performance of Hb and GOD electrodes was further investigated. As for Hb-MCFs@rGO/GCE, the GOD electrode displayed excellent analytical performance for the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), including a good sensitivity of 0.25 mu A mu mol(-1) L cm(-2), a low detection limit of 63.6 nmol L-1 based on S/N = 3, and a low apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K-M(app)) of 49.05 mu mol L-1. GOD-MCFs@rGO/GCE also exhibited good analytical performance for the detection of glucose, with a wide linear range of 0.25-8.0 mmol L-1. In addition, blood glucose detection in samples of human serum was successfully achieved using GOD-MCFs@rGO/GCE with a low quantification limit.

On the basis of their interesting applications, it is highly desirable to develop new synthetic methodologies to obtain carbon materials with controllable pore size and morphology. Herein, a facile synthesis of hollow microporous carbon spheres (HCSs) from hollow microporous organic capsules (HMOCs) with a good control over the pore morphology, hollow cavity, and the shell thickness is reported. The highly porous hollow carbon spheres are prepared by the pyrolysis of HMOCs-based microporous polymers. The synthetic parameters, such as hypercrosslinking and pyrolysis conditions, are optimized to modify the porous structures and the properties. The morphology and porosity as well as energy storage applications of the microporous structures HCSs, derived through a combination of divinylbenzene-crosslinking and micropore-generating hypercrosslinking, are discussed. These findings provide a new benchmark for fabricating well-defined HCSs with great promise for various applications.

Herein, we report a simple yet effective method to fabricate Fe3O4 particles coated with nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe3O4-NC) by a strategy combining polymerization and carbonization. The materials are characterized using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles are completely encapsulated by the nitrogen-doped carbon materials, and the nanosized sphere-like Fe3O4-NC materials can deliver a capacitance of 346 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1), with 97% of the initial specific capacitance after 5000 cycles. The outstanding capacitive performance is due to the unique and uniform structure of the Fe3O4-NC nanocomposites, where the synergistic effect between coated-carbon layers with high conductivity and Fe3O4 nanoparticles with good pseudocapacitance.

The capture for cancer cells is based on effective recognition of the modified rGO surface through the aptamer against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). The rough structure of rGO enhances morphologic interactions between rGO film interface and the cancer cells, while super-hydrophilicity of modified rGO hinders nonspecific cell capture. The synergistic interactions offer the aptamer macroarray high efficiency of cancer cell capture. By means of a turn-on fluorescence strategy based on the conformation change of the aptamer induced by the target recognition, the enriched cancer cells can be directly read out at excitation/emission wavelengths of 550/680 nm without washing, separation, and dying steps.

The NS-3D rGO electrode with abundant porosity and active sites promotes electrolyte infiltration and broadens the working voltage range. The ASC (NPOH-0.5@rGO//NS-3D rGO) shows a maximum voltage of up to 1.4 V, outstanding cycling ability (capacitance retention of 95.5% after 10,000 cycles), and excellent rate capability (capacitance retention of 77% as the current density is increased ten times). The ASC can light up an light-emitting diodes (LED) for more than 20 min after charging for 20 s.

However, the development of a simple strategy for the fabrication of CAs with the properties of high compression and excellent fatigue resistance is still significantly challenging. In this study, Pickering emulsion gel technology, which depends on the aqueous dispersion of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), graphene oxide (GO), and 1, 2-dichloroethane solution of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) that occurs in mixture, emulsification, gelation, and freeze-drying process, was used to form a CNF-GO/PMMA composite aerogel. Subsequently, the final carbon aerogel (C-RGO/P) was obtained through annealing treatment. The resultant C-RGO/P exhibits super compressibility and excellent elasticity, and can resist an extreme compressive strain of 99.3% while maintaining 92.6% of the height retention after 5000 cycles at the strain of 80%. Additionally, it exhibits high sensitivity at the working pressure range of 0-1000 Pa, and can thus act as a wearable pressure sensor for the accurate monitoring of human physiological signals. Moreover, it can be used as an EMI shielding material with satisfactory EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of 36.75 dB and specific shielding effectiveness (SSE) of 29400 dB cm(3) g(-1).

One is the "shuttle effect" originated from the sulfur cathode, and the other is the low Coulombic efficiency and security issues arising from the lithium metal anode. In addressing these issues, we propose a novel silicon-sulfurized poly(acrylonitrile) full battery. In this lithium metal-free system, the Li source is pre-loaded in the cathode, using a nitrogen evolution reaction (NER) to implant Li+ into the silicon/carbon anode. Sulfurized poly(acrylonitrile) based on a solid-solid conversion mechanism can fundamentally circumvent the "shuttle effect". Meanwhile, the silicon/carbon anode can achieve more efficient utilization and higher security when compared with the Li metal anode. The full cell used in this technology can deliver a capacity of 1169.3 mAh g(-1), and it can be stabilized over 100 cycles, implying its excellent electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the practical pouch cell with a high sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2) can achieve a high specific energy of 513.2 Wh kg(-1). The mechanism of the NER in cathode has also been investigated and analyzed by in situ methods. Notably, this battery design completely conforms to the current battery production technology because of the degassing of gasbag, resulting in a low manufacturing cost. This work will open the avenue to develop a lithium metal-free battery using the NER. (C) 2021 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, Q; Wu, K; Wang, HC; Liu, W; Zhou, HH				Wang, Qian; Wu, Kai; Wang, Hangchao; Liu, Wen; Zhou, Henghui			Lithiophilic 3D SnS2@Carbon Fiber Cloth for Stable Li Metal Anode	ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Composite Li anode; Current collector; Lithium dendrite; Carbon fiber cloth; Li alloy	ELECTRICAL ENERGY-STORAGE; LITHIUM; CHALLENGES; BATTERIES	Li metal batteries (LMBs) have attracted worldwide attention in recent years with a focus on the extremely high theoretical energy density of 3580 Wh.kg(-1) (Li-O-2) and 2600 Wh.kg(-1) (Li-S), which benefit from the highest specific capacity (3860 mAh.g(-1)) and the lowest negative potential (-3.04 V) of Li metal anodes. However, further development and practical applications are hindered by the formation of Li dendrites and a large volume expansion, which not only lowers the coulombic efficiency but also leads to many security risks, such as internal short circuits, fires, and even explosions. In this study, we selected a low-cost and commercial carbon fiber cloth (CC) as a 3D framework for accommodating Li metal and relieving the volume expansion during the Li plating/stripping process. In addition, lithiophilic SnS2 nano-sheet arrays were grown on the surface of carbon fiber cloth via a one-step method. The SnS2 arrays can be partially converted to Li-Sn alloy and Li2S components during the Li plating process. The as-formed Li-Sn alloy can provide reversible sites for further Li deposition and improve the electrochemical kinetics process. As a typical component of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), Li2S can promote Li+ migration at SEI and ensure a homogeneous distribution of Li+-flux near the electrode surface, thereby reducing the overpotential of Li deposition and suppressing the formation and growth of Li dendrites. Meanwhile, the 3D carbon skeleton can also reduce the local current density of the electrode because of its high specific surface area to ensure uniform Li deposition. Benefiting from the design of the combination bulk and the surface, the composite SnS2@carbon fiber cloth (SnS2@CC) demonstrated excellent prospects for practical applications. Upon pairing with Li foils, the SnS2@CC electrode displayed stable cycling performance with improved coulombic efficiency (>98%) over 100 cycles at 1.0 mAcm(-2)/5.0 mAh.cm(-2). After loading 10 mAh.cm(-2) Li metal, the composite Li metal anode could run over 400 h with a low overpotential of 60 mV at a current density of 1.0 mAcm(-2), even when the current density was increased to 2.0 mAcm(-2); additionally, a low overpotential of 85 mV could also be maintained over 350 h, manifesting one of the most stable composite Li metal anodes to date. Moreover, when the composite Li metal anode was assembled with a LiFePO4 cathode, the full cells exhibited a high initial specific discharge capacity of 160.6 mAh.g(-1) and high cycling stability. At a rate of 2.0C, the cell showed a high capacity retention of 80.6% after 500 cycles. We believe that the lithiophilic SnS2@CC composite electrode offers a simple and effective strategy to suppress dendritic Li growth and relieve the volume change during the charging/discharging process.

Here, we report a novel concept of a 3D nanometer (nm)-thin membrane that can overcome the shortcomings of conventional membrane structures. Our 3D membrane is composed of two three-dimensionally interwoven channels that are separated by a continuous nm-thin amorphous TiO(2)layer. This 3D architecture dramatically increases the surface area by 6000 times, coupled with an ultra-short diffusion distance through the 2-4 nm-thin selective layer that allows for ultrafast gas and water transport, similar to 900 l m(-2)h(-1)bar(-1). The 3D membrane also exhibits a very high ion rejection (R similar to 100% for potassium ferricyanide) due to the combined size- and charge-based exclusion mechanisms. The combination of high ion rejection and ultrafast permeation makes our 3DM superior to the state-of-the-art high-flux membranes whose performances are limited by the flux-rejection tradeoff. Furthermore, its ultimate Li(+)selectivity over polysulfide or gas can potentially solve major technical challenges in energy storage applications, such as lithium-sulfur or lithium-O(2)batteries.

This novel hydrothermal approach is not only simple but also provides the surface of CEMNs with functional groups like -OH. The formation of carbon encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles was not favored when using pure Fe nanoparticles as cores because of the oxidation of Fe nanoparticles by H2O during the reaction and, therefore, the surfaces of the naked Fe nanoparticles had to be coated by Au shell in advance. TEM, XRD, XPS and VSM measurments characterized that they were uniform carbon spheres containing some embedded Fe-Au nanoparticles, with a saturation of 14.6 emu/g and the size of the typical product is -350 nm.

It is found that the Dirac-cone dispersions appear at the Fermi level in the bands introduced by the B or N heteroatom, linear B-B or N-N dimers, demonstrating that the carrier mobility is similar to 10(6) m s(-1) which is comparable with that of the pristine graphene. Most importantly, such dimer lines act as the quasi-1-D conducting nanowires whose charge carriers are confined around the linear defects in these dimers while the charge carriers in pristine graphene are dispersed two-dimensionally. Such systems suggest that heteroatoms in graphene can indeed contribute to the Dirac cone. In addition, the type of carriers (p-type or n-type) can be manipulated using the B or N heteroatoms, respectively. This will greatly enrich the electronic properties of Dirac semimetals.

After the polymerization of pyrrole catalyzed by Fe3+, the PMMA microspheres were removed to form PPCPE. The pore size was determined by SEM observations, with diameters ranging from 2 to 5m. The anodic stripping voltammetry response of DNA indicated that the adsorption of oligonucleotide on PPCPE was enhanced. The PPCPE was easy to preserve and had a good reusability in comparison with that of a pure carbon paste electrode (CPE) and a carbon nanotube-modified carbon paste electrode (CNTPE). The detection limits of guanine and adenine were 20nM and 8nM, respectively.

High mass loading, ultrastable and free-standing carbon-selenium cathode is conveniently achieved by tailoring both the Se content and the thickness of deposited Al2O3 layer. Importantly, in contrast to only 176 mAh g(-1) of the electrode without Al2O3 deposition after 660 cycles, the composite with a Se content of 67 wt% and a 3-nm Al2O3 thickness retains a reversible capacity of 503 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles with no capacity fading at 0.5 A g(-1). These findings clearly suggest that ALD strategy provides a viable, controllable and effective means of tuning the electrode performance towards high mass loading of active materials and long cycle life of the resulting battery for energy storage applications.

Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that carbon nanotubes were wrapped by polypropylene and dispersed homogeneously in polypropylene matrix. Infrared spectroscopy results showed that there was covalently linkage between polypropylene and carbon nanotubes via maleic anhydride grafting. The linkage was further confirmed by Raman observation. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction research revealed that the carbon nanotubes act as nucleating agent to promote crystallisation. Owing to the uniform dispersion of carbon nanotubes and covalent adhesion between polypropylene and carbon nanotubes, the thermal stability of polypropylene was improved.

Flexible solid state supercapacitors are shortlisted as one of the most promising energy devices to power electronics with medium to high power density requirements. In this work, we developed a simple but effective way to produce a mechanically strong and electrochemically active RGO/polypyrrole (PPy) fibre paper. A well-bedded microstructure was created with interlaced polypyrrole fibres evenly distributed between the graphene layers. Such microstructure can create enormous amount of pores and therefore provides larger interfaces for charge carrier storage/release. The effects of polypyrrole fibres on the film's morphologies, mechanical properties and electrochemical performance were discussed. A solid state supercapacitor was demonstrated using such paper electrodes and a gel type electrolyte - phosphate acid (H3PO4) infused polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). It showed a high capacitance (345 F g(-1)) and an excellent cycling stability (9.4% drop after 1000 cycles). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ordered mesoporous carbon was prepared by pyrolysis of sucrose filled in the mesoporous channels of SBA-15 at 1 200 degrees C, and followed by dissolution of the silica matrix in hydrofluoric acid. The pore structure of the MC material, was evaluated using XRD, nitrogen adsorption, TEM. SEM showed that PANI-MC films presented a wholy modified morphology when compared to PANI film. Electrochemical characterization indicated that the potential shift toward negative direction. This can be attributed to the porous feature of MC, which imposes resistance for ion migration in mesoporous. The deposition potential and time had been optimized for determination of Cu2+ in aqueous solution. ASV analysis revealed that the new electrode presented a linear response to low concentrations of Cu2+. Under optimized conditions, the current showed a linear dependence with concentration in the range 1.00x10(-8)similar to 1x10(-6) mol . L-1. The detection limit was 6x10(-9) mol . L-1.

However, there is limited understanding of the relationship between structural and electronic properties and electrochemical storage capacity. First-principles calculations on a doped graphene cluster propose that N, S co-doping can promote the electronegativity, adsorption capacity of Na atoms and diffusion of Na+ ions on graphene sheets, especially for the sample consisting of more pyridinic-N, while excessive O atoms may alleviate these. All these features render N, S co-doped carbon as a superior anode for sodium ion batteries. Therefore, the N, S co-doped carbon nanosheets are fabricated via a simple thermal treatment method using gelatin as the carbon source and thiourea as the N and S precursor. The optimized product (m(gelatin) : m(thiourea) = 1 : 10) results in a superb cycling capacity of 300 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles, with a coulombic efficiency of similar to 100%.

The CFC/S composites are the excellent cathodes of room-temperature sodium- sulfur (RT Na-S) batteries due to their three-dimensional (3D) interconnected network and high electrolyte uptake of 1156%. The CFC/S composite with area sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2) displays an initial discharge capacity of 390 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C ( 1 C=1675 mA g(-1)) and a capacity of 120 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles with tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether liquid electrolyte. Furthermore, since the freestanding CFC/S composites exhibit good flexibility and conductivity, they can serve as the cathodes of flexible RT Na-S batteries. As a proof of concept, the soft-packaged RT Na-S batteries were fabricated. The capacity of soft-packaged RT Na-S batteries can remain stable when the batteries are bent.

Besides a high electron transport ability, a close contact between the CE and electrolyte is crucial to its outstanding catalytic activity for the I-3(-)/I redox reaction. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and three-dimensional graphene networks (3DGNs) were used to fabricate the CE, and the graphene-based CE endowed the resulting DSSC with excellent photovoltaic performance features. The high quality and continuous structure of the 3DGNs provided a channel amenable to fast transport of electrons, while the RGO afforded a close contact at the interface between the graphene basal plane and electrolyte. The obtained energy conversion efficiency () was closely related to the mass fraction and reduction degree of the RGO that was used. Corresponding optimization yielded, for the DSSCs based on the 3DGN-RGO CE, a value of as high as 9.79%, comparable to that of the device using a Pt CE and hence implying promising prospects for the as-prepared CE.

However, due to the complexity of HCs, the relationship between their structures and potassium (K) storage behaviors is still not quite clear. Here, three types of HCs with different structures are designed for further understanding the electrochemical storage processes. Among them, the carbon spheres (CS) exhibit impressive rate performance (161.6 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)) and cycle stability (140.2 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) after 500 cycles). The superior performance of CS can be mainly ascribed to the intercalation into its locally-ordered carbon nanocrystallites, and the charge/discharge processes are further characterized with significant pseudocapacitive dominating. Suitable nanocrystalline size and the ratio of defects with proper morphology are the key factors to improve K storage efficiency. This work will contribute to understanding the role of these factors in the K storage performance of carbon materials.

J	Liu, DQ; Li, QW; Li, S; Hou, JB; Zhao, HZ				Liu, Daoqing; Li, Qianwei; Li, Si; Hou, Jinbao; Zhao, Huazhang			A confinement strategy to prepare N-doped reduced graphene oxide foams with desired monolithic structures for supercapacitors	NANOSCALE			English	Article							BINDER-FREE SUPERCAPACITORS; POROUS CARBON; HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS; 3D GRAPHENE; NITROGEN; REDUCTION; ENERGY; ELECTRODES; EXFOLIATION; COMPOSITES	It is a challenge to achieve pure graphene foams with a desired monolithic structure in order to take advantage of the excellent properties of graphene-based macroscopic assemblies. Here, we introduced a confinement fabrication strategy to prepare nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide foams (NrGFs) through a one-step hydrothermal process. The melamine foam (MF) skeleton was removed during the hydrothermal reaction, and the NrGF retained its desired monolithic structure by the confinement of solution ionic strength. Due to the roof-tile-like microscopic morphology with high N-doping (9.88 at%), the free-standing graphene foam electrode exhibited excellent capacitive performance. The resulting NrGF-based symmetric supercapacitor displayed a remarkably enhanced specific capacitance of 260 F g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and 173 F g(-1) at 20 A g(-1) in an aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the facility of fabrication makes it a promising material in many contexts for large scale production, such as energy storage, environmental remediation and strain sensors. Furthermore, this synthesis strategy can be expanded to prepare other pure macroporous foams or composites by using different building blocks (such as CNTs and MXene).

The C-CNT not only remained unique hexagonal tubular structure obtained from supramolecular self-assembly method, but also introduced aromatic carbon into CN framework under the glucose-assisted hydrothermal conditions. The as-prepared C-CNT exposed abundant nitrogen defects and dramatically improved the valid separation of photoexcited charge carriers, hence achieving excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity (32.3 mu mol h(-1), lambda > 420 nm), which was up to 4.24 and 12-folds higher than pristine carbon nitride tube (CNT) and traditional bulk counterpart (BCN), respectively. Therefore, this work highlights an assisted hydrothermal approach to successfully prepare carbon-rich graphitic carbon nitride with hexagonal tubular structure.

Herein, we combined nickel iron phosphide (NiFe-P) nanosheets with three-dimensional porous graphene foam (3DGF) as a substrate to design a bifunctional electrocatalyst NiFe-P@3DGF with excellent catalytic activity towards oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively) under alkaline conditions. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotentials for the OER and HER are less than 189 and 131 mV, respectively, and the stabilities exceed 50 h. Furthermore, this bifunctional catalyst also exhibits excellent water-splitting capability with a cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The special structure of the 3DGF substrate with its large surface area, high conductivity, and robust skeleton, as well as the unique core-shell structure of NiFe (oxy)hydroxides/phosphide formed throughout the reaction promote the high activity of the electrocatalyst. Therefore, this work provides a new perspective to exploit the efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst using porous 3DGF as the substrate.

As the cathodes in Li-S batteries, the as-prepared ZnO@S/CNT composite illustrates a superior high initial capacity of 1663 mAh g(-1) at a charge/discharge rate of 160 mA g(-1), and maintains a reversible capacity at approximately 942 mAh g(-1) after 70 cycles. While for Ni(OH)(2)@S/CNT composites, its initial capacity is also as high as 1331 mAh g(-1), but a poorer cycling stability is presented. When the charge/discharge current is increased to 1600 mA g(-1), a high reversible capacity of 698 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles still can be obtained for the ZnO@S/CNT composite, far better than that of Ni(OH)(2)@S/CNT composites. The better cycling performance and high discharge capacity can be attributed to the strong interactions between ZnO and S-x(2) species, which is verified by the density functional theory (DFT) calculation result that the ZnO exhibits a higher adsorption energy for Li2S8 than the Ni(OH)(2).

Integrated experiments, and Monte Carlo and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the induced potential originates from the nonhomogeneous distribution of functional groups along the film, especially carboxy groups. Sufficient adsorbed water molecules in porous carbon facilitate the release of protons from the carboxy groups, resulting in a potential drop across the carbon film because of the concentration difference of the released free protons on the two sides. The potential utilization of such a phenomenon is also demonstrated by a self-powered humidity sensor.

In this work mesoporous carbon material with ultrahigh surface area is prepared with hexagonally packed mesoporous silica (HMS) as template. After a systematic optimization of different synthesis parameters, carbon material with a specific surface area of 2644 m(2)/g is obtained with resol as carbon precursors, the highest value reported so far for silica-templated mesoporous carbons. The material can be loaded with nickel nanoparticles through addition of nickel chloride hexahydrate into the resol solution. Hydrogen uptake of the nickel-decorated carbon at room temperature and 20 bar reaches 2.66 mmol/g, 78% higher than that of the pristine carbon. Due to the sharp decrease of the specific surface area and pore volume after nickel decoration, the improvement is attributed to effects of nickel nanopartides.

Spin polarization of graphene on Co2FeGe0.5Ga0.5(001) observed by spin-polarized surface positronium spectroscopy	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							ANNIHILATION	Following previous work on graphene on Ni(111) and Co(0001) surfaces [Phys. Rev. B 97, 195405 (2018)], the spin polarization of graphene on a Co2FeGe0.5Ga0.5 (CFGG) (001) surface was examined using spin-polarized surface positronium spectroscopy. The graphene was found to be magnetically insulated from the CFGG(001) even after heat treatment, which increased the spin polarizations of graphene on Ni(111) and Co(0001). First-principles calculations indicated that graphene is weakly bound to the CFGG(001) surface mainly through the van der Waals interaction, and consequently the interlayer distance between graphene and the CFGG(001) surface is greater (similar to 3 angstrom) than that between graphene and Ni(111) or Co(0001) (similar to 2 angstrom). The weak hybridization between graphene and CFGG(001) sufficiently reduces the spin polarization in graphene, which enables the magnetic insulation of graphene from CFGG.

To tackle this challenge, we demonstrate a facile approach to fabricate a hierarchically structured composite of Fe2P@nitrogen, phosphorus codoped carbon (Fe2P@NPC) by direct biological recycling of iron metal from electroplating sludge using bacteria. This material, featuring uniform dispersion of Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) in porous NPC matrix, effectively adapts volume variation of sulfur upon cycling and simultaneously provides multiple channels for efficient lithium ion transport. In addition, Fe2P NPs with strong adhesion properties of tightly anchored soluble LiPSs formed during discharge can significantly facilitate the decomposition of Li2S during the subsequent charging process. The Li-S cell built on this cathode architecture delivers high specific capacity (1555.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), appreciable rate capability (679.7 mAh g(-1) at 10 C), and greatly enhanced cycling performance (761.9 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C after 500 cycles).

Mesoporous TiO2 coating on carbon-sulfur cathode for high capacity Li-sulfur battery	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							LITHIUM/SULFUR CELL; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; LONG-LIFE; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROLYTES; INTERLAYER; HOST	In this paper, a meso-porous TiO2 (titania) coating is shown to effectively protect a carbon-sulfur composite cathode from polysulfide dissolution. The cathode consisted of a sulfur impregnated carbon support coated with a few microns thick mesoporous titania layer. The carbon-sulfur cathode is made using activated carbon powder (ACP) derived from biomass. The mesoporous titania coated carbon-sulfur cathodes exhibit a retention capacity after 100 cycles at C/3 rate (433 mA g (-1)) and stabilized at a capacity around 980 mA h g(-1). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the sulfur cathodes suggests that the charge transfer resistance at the anode, (R-act) is stable for the titania coated sulfur electrode in comparison to a continuous increase in R-act for the uncoated electrode implying mitigation of polysulfide shuttling for the protected cathode. Stability in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) data for the first 5 cycles further confirms the polysulfide containment in the titania coated cathode while the uncoated sulfur electrode shows significant irreversibility in the CV with considerable shifting of the voltage peak positions. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies confirm the adsorption of soluble polysulfides by mesoporous titania.

The 3D porous carbon materials can be an effective lithium host for the application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) in addressing the challenging issues of the growth of lithium dendrites and the uncontrollable formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The 3D hosts can effectively restrain the growth of Li dendrites by trapping metallic Li in the matrix as well as decreasing local current. Ag nanoparticles act as heterogeneous nucleation sites because of the low nucleation overpotential, and therefore, spatial control of Li metal is realized. The as-fabricated Ag-NCNS electrode presents a dendrite-free plating morphology and long-term cycling stability with the Coulombic efficiency maintained at more than 98% for 200 cycles at 0.5 mA cm(-2) with a cycling capacity of 1.0 mA h cm(-2). In symmetric cells, the Ag-NCNS/Li electrode exhibits much lower voltage hysteresis and stable cycling performance for more than 2000 h.

To obtain high-performance PIBs based energy storage, the energy storage anode must provide a stable and suitable structure for large-sized active potassium ions. To this end, a lotus leaf-derived, hierarchically porous activated carbon (LHPAC) was mainly obtained by a bionic strategy. The prepared LHPAC with a hierarchically porous structure not only affords fast transportation for both electrons and potassium ions but also supplies the necessary void space to avoid structural instability incurred by volume dilatation in the process of electrode operation.

In this work, a 3D network biowaste carbon with macropores derived from common biowaste in the form of apple pomace collected from concentrated juice factory is employed for sodium ion battery anodes. The 3D network carbon constructed with lots of shell-like macropores approximately 500 nm, and a small amount of tiny pores around 50 nm is achieved at an optimized condition. The 3D network carbon electrodes with a high mass loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2) exhibit the promising areal capacity of 1.91 mAh cm(-2) after 200 cycles. The average reversible Coulombic efficiency is 99.3%. While the gravimetric capacity retention is over 90% (208 mAh g(-1)) after 200 cycles compared with a normal mass loading of 0.9 mg cm(-2). The performances show one of the best storages in the chart among ever reported areal capacity. This mainly because that the 3D network carbon structure can provide reaction microspaces, high electrical conductivity, and relieve the volumetric expansion.

The internal stress on the surface results in lattice distortion with expanding Ti-Ti bonds, endowing the Mxene nanosheet with abundant active sites and regulating the d-band center of Ti atoms upshifted closer to the Fermi level, leading to strengthened LiPS adsorbability and accelerated catalytic conversion. The macroporous framework offers uniformed sulfur distribution, potent sulfur immobilization, and large surface area. The composite interwoven by CNT tentacle enhances conductivity and prevents the restacking of Mxene sheets. This combination of tensile strain effect and hierarchical architecture design results in smooth and favorable trapping-diffusion-conversion of LiPS on the interface. The Li-S battery exhibits an initial capacity of 1451 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, rate capability up to 8 C, and prolonged cycle life.

The structure and morphology of the PNIPAM/GO nanocomposite hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as by determination of swelling, mechanical property, phase transformation behaviors, and photo-thermal conversion performance. The results revealed that the phase transition temperatures of all the nanocomposite hydrogels were approximately 33 degrees C and the hydrogel (PG-2), under discharge voltage 600 V, had faster change of swelling ratios for distilled water, more sensitive to pH, and better photo-thermal property than other nanocomposite hydrogels. In addition, shrinkage of the network hydrogels and enhancement of the compressive strength and Young's modulus took place at higher discharge voltage. This work provided a new pathway for preparation of PNIPAM/GO nanocomposite hydrogels, with environmental friendliness and excellent photo-thermal property, which may allow their use in the intelligence remote controlled area.

It was discovered that the resulting N doped QG (N-QG) nanozyme can present the greatly enhanced catalysis activity, which is nearly 5-fold higher than that of pristine QG, as comparably revealed by the kinetic studies. Herein, the plasma treatment-assisted N doping could improve the conductivity (hydrophilicity) and create the surface defects of QG so as to promote the electron transferring toward the enhanced catalytic activities of N-QG. Furthermore, the catalase, superoxide explored, indicating the N doping could endow the obtained nanozyme with a high specificity of peroxidase-like catalysis. The application feasibility of the developed N-QG nanozyme was demonstrated subsequently by the catalysis-based colorimetric assays for H2O2 in milk samples, with the linear range from 2.00 to 1500 mu M. Importantly, such a plasma-assisted heteroatom doping route may open a door toward the large-scale applications for the rational designs of various enzyme mimics with improved catalysis performances.

It was achieved by calcination/carbonization of the as-deposited SnO2-gel/cellulose hybrid in an argon atmosphere. As being employed as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the porous structures, small SnO2 crystallite sizes, and the carbon buffering matrix possessed by the nanocomposite facilitate the electrode-electrolyte contact, promote the electron transfer and Li+ diffusion, and relieve the severe volume change and aggregation of the active particles during the charge/discharge cycles. Hence, the nanocomposite showed high reversible capacity, significant cycling stability, and rate capability that are superior to the nanotubular SnO2 and SnO2 sol-gel powder counter materials. For such a composite with 27.8wt% SnO2 content and 346.4m(2)g(-1) specific surface area, a capacity of 623mAhg(-1) was delivered after 120 cycles at 0.2C. Further coating of the SnO2/carbon nanofibers with an additional carbon layer resulted in an improved cycling stability and rate performance.

In this study, nitrogen-rich carbon nanosheets are first prepared and then annealed with NaH2PO4 to synthesize phosphorus doping nitrogen-rich carbon nanosheets. Two obtained materials are utilized as anodes of sodium-ion batteries and potassium-ion batteries, revealing that phosphorus doping can improve sodiation capacity (247.9 vs. 175.1 mA h g(-1)) and lower potassiation capacity (207.2 vs. 242.6 mA h g(-1)). To explore the inner reason for this phenomenon, Na+ and K+ diffusion coefficients are surveyed through galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, showing that the electrode with large ion diffusion coefficient delivers a large capacity. This work provides some use for reference in introduction of heteroatoms to carbonaceous anode materials of sodium-ion batteries and potassium-ion batteries.

A zirconia sol was synthesized with the zirconium oxychloride, ammonia and polyethylene glycol, each of them acting as the zirconium resource, precipitant and surfactant. The morphology, phase composition and thermal properties of the zirconia coated carbon fiber were evaluated by SEM, EDS. XRD and TG-DTA. The increase of dipping cycles can raise the thickness of the coating, while attaching more ZrO2 crystals on the coating surface. Mass variations of the 3 mol% YSZ and 2 mol% YSZ coated carbon fibers at 800 degrees C are 20% and 40%, less than the 70% of the uncoated carbon fiber. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although a plethora of advanced sulfur hosts and electrocatalysts have been examined, the fundamental mechanisms are still elusive and predictive design approaches have not yet been established. Here, we examined a series of well-defined Fe-N-C sulfur hosts with systematically varied and strongly coupled Fe3C and Fe electrocatalysts, prepared by one-step pyrolysis of a novel Fe-x[Fe(CN)(6)](y)/polypyrrole composite at different temperatures. We revealed the key roles of Fe3C and metallic Fe on modulating polysulfide conversion, in that the polar Fe3C strongly adsorbs polysulfide whereas the Fe particles catalyze fast polysulfide conversion. We then highlight the superior performance of the rational host with strongly coupled Fe3C and Fe on mesoporous Fe-N-C host on promoting nearly complete polysulfide conversion, especially for the challenging short-chain Li2S4 conversion to Li2S. The electrodeposited Li2S on this host was extremely reactive and can be readily charged back to S with minimal activation overpotential. Overall, Li-S batteries equipped with the novel sulfur host delivered a high specific capacity of 1350 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C with a capacity retention of 96% after 200 cycles. This work provides new insights on the functional mechanism of advanced sulfur hosts, which could eventually translate into new design principles for practical Li-S batteries.

The resulting hybrids own interconnected 3D macroporous frameworks with the IHPD particles (2 mm in diameter) encapsulated in flexible graphene sheets. Used as the cathode material in lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the GA/IHPDs hybrids show an excellent reversible specific capacity of 155 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g(-1) and maintain the specific capacities of 80 and 56 mA h g(-1) at the ultrahigh current densities of 2000 and 5000 mA g(-1), respectively. To our best knowledge, such an electrochemical performance of GA/IHPDs is superior to the literature reported graphene and other carbon based LiFePO4, or FePO4 hybrids. With a simple fabrication procedure and desirable electrochemical performance, this method offers a highly promising candidate for commercialized cathode materials of LIBs.

Energy levels of double triangular graphene quantum dots	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article								We investigate theoretically the energy levels of the coupled double triangular graphene quantum dots (GQDs) based on the tight-binding Hamiltonian model. The double GQDs including the ZZ-type, ZA-type, and AA-type GQDs with the two GQDs having the zigzag or armchair boundaries can be coupled together via different interdot connections, such as the direct coupling, the chains of benzene rings, and those of carbon atoms. It is shown that the energy spectrum of the coupled double GQDs is the amalgamation of those spectra of the corresponding two isolated GQDs with the modification triggered by the interdot connections. The interdot connection is inclined to lift up the degeneracies of the energy levels in different degree, and as the connection changes from the direct coupling to the long chains, the removal of energy degeneracies is suppressed in ZZ-type and AA-type double GQDs, which indicates that the two coupled GQDs are inclined to become decoupled. Then we consider the influences on the spectra of the coupled double GQDs induced by the electric fields applied on the GQDs or the connection, which manifests as the global spectrum redistribution or the local energy level shift. Finally, we study the symmetrical and asymmetrical energy spectra of the double GQDs caused by the substrates supporting the two GQDs, clearly demonstrating how the substrates affect the double GQDs' spectrum. This research elucidates the energy spectra of the coupled double GQDs, as well as the mechanics of manipulating them by the electric field and the substrates, which would be a significant reference for designing GQD-based devices.

Furthermore, high temperature industrial syngas can be directly purified at elevated temperatures, so the temperature variation during purification process is not as large as that in Selexol, Rectisol or some other methods, which benefits to the simplification of heat management and improvement of energy efficiency. At working temperatures of approximately 200 degrees C, activated carbon is considered to be a promising adsorbent. Nevertheless, activated carbon also adsorbs large amounts of steam during rinse and purge, which affects its adsorption capacity. Herein, hydrophobic activated carbon was synthesized by impregnation and characterized, achieving a contact angle with a water droplet of up to 134 degrees. When exposed to wet air, the weight increase of the hydrophobic adsorbent was 0.3%, whereas it was approximately 12% for the commercial activated carbon, which can be mainly attributed to vapor adsorption. The CO2 adsorption capacity was tested under humid conditions at 200 degrees C on a fixed bed. The effect of steam on the hydrophobic adsorbent was much smaller than that on the commercial adsorbent. The working capacity decreased from 0.091 to 0.009 mmol/g when the commercial activated carbon was operated under steam at 1 atm, whereas the hydrophobic material exhibited a stable and desired working capacity at the same condition, which was around 0.05 mmol/g. Steam rinse and purge were demonstrated to be feasible for the hydrophobic adsorbent and the introducing of steam rinse could not only compensate for the deterioration of adsorption capacity resulting from impregnation, but further improve the purification efficiency.

Transmission and scanning electron microscopy examinations of CNT/polystyrene (PS) and CNT/epoxy composite showed that these polymers adhered well to CNT at the nanometer scale. Molecular mechanics simulations and elasticity calculations were used to quantify some of the important interfacial characteristics that critically control the performance of a composite material. In the absence of chemical bonding between CNT and the matrix, it is found that the non-bond interactions, consist of electrostatic and van der Waals forces, result in CNT-polymer interfacial shear stress (at 0 K) of about 138 and 186 MPa, respectively, for CNT/epoxy and CNT/PS. The high interfacial shear stress calculated, about an order of magnitude higher than micro fiber reinforced composites, is believed attributed to intimate contact between the two solid phases at the molecular scale. Simulations and calculations also showed that local non-uniformity of CNT and mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansions between CNT and polymer matrix also promote the stress transfer ability between the two.

Up to now, most researchers have focused on the design of the state of the art S-containing composites or new and complex electrode architectures to improve their electrochemical performances. However, simple and low cost sulfur cathodes usually exhibit poor cycle performances. Here, we propose gelatinized starch, a natural biological macromolecule from the food industry as a binder for low cost sulfur cathodes to improve their capacity retention. Compared with PVDF, the starch binder is able to reduce the polarization of the sulfur cathode and enhance its capacity retention. The sulfur cathode with the starch binder exhibits a specific capacity retention of similar to 90% at 0.2 C after 200 cycles, which corresponds to a small capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle. It is believed that these improvements result from the high stability of the starch binder in a liquid electrolyte, which can stabilize the structure of the cathode and reduce the irreversible accumulation of the discharge products.

All the O, N-codoped activated carbon aerogels exhibit 3D interconnected hierarchical porous network structures with high specific surface areas (1337-1695 m(2) g(-1)), ultramicropores (0.52-0.54 nm), and rich O (12.68-18.48%) and N (1.18-3.59%) doping. A typical 3D O, N-codoped activated carbon aerogel (ACA700) obtained at the activation of 700 A degrees C exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. When ACA700 is utilized as electrode materials for supercapacitor, the highest specific capacitance of 342 F g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1) in 3 M H2SO4 electrolyte is achieved. Furthermore, ACA700//ACA700 all-solid-state supercapacitor device displays acceptable energy density (3.8 Wh kg(-1)) at a power density of 246.0 W kg(-1), extraordinary coulombic efficiency (95.8%), and good rate capability. Therefore, the sustainable 3D O, N-codoped activated carbon aerogels with ultramicropores demonstrate tremendous potential for energy storage devices.

Exploring safer Li metal replacement is thus of fundamental and technical importance for enabling Li-metal-free sulfur batteries. Aluminium (Al) is an appealing Li-alloy anode material for the sake of its high capacity, natural abundance, and safety. Pairing Al-Li alloy with sulfur (S) could be a promising strategy to achieve high-energy rechargeable batteries with improved safety. Herein we show the suppressed dendrite growth and the enhanced ambient stability of Al-Li alloy anode. A Li-metal-free Li-ion sulfur battery was assembled with an Al-Li alloy anode, a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode and a carbonate electrolyte. This Li-ion sulfur full cell exhibited good reversibility and stability, with a slow decaying rate at 0.09% per cycle. The specific energy of the full cell based on the total weight of active materials is estimated to be in a range of 589-762 Wh/kg.

However, LCBs normally suffer from dramatic volume expansion of elemental chalcogen, dissolution and shuffling of intermediates in ether electrolytes, and serious Li dendrite growth. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been employed to resolve these pressing issues, including the construction of cathodes, fabrication of interlayers, modification of separators, and design of Li anodes. In this review, the properties of different chalcogen elements and the electrochemistry of LCBs are first provided. Next, the multiple functions of CNTs are presented to mitigate the notorious issues faced by LCBs. More importantly, recent representative studies on CNT-based architectures for LCBs are presented and analyzed in detail, in terms of design concepts, fabrication methods, electrochemical performance, and underlying mechanisms. Finally, the remaining issues and future challenges in the adoption of CNTs for LCBs are discussed. It is believed that this paper can provide new insights into the further development and commercialization of LCBs.

In this study, a new type of versatile nanoassemblies (denoted as PC@GCpD(Gd)) was rationally designed by integrating the polydopamine stabilized graphene quantum dots (GQD)-photosensitizer nanocomposites (denoted as GCpD), immunostimulatory polycationic polymer/CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN) nanoparticles (denoted as PC) and Gd3+/Cy3 imaging probes for dual magnetic resonance/fluorescence imaging-guided photoimmunotherapy. PC@GCpD(Gd) effectively killed the tumor cells through the amplified photothermal and photodynamic effects mediated by GCpD, and contemporaneously delivered CpG ODN to the targeted endosomal Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) to continuously stimulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the maturation of dendritic cells, thereby resulting in the activation and infiltration of T lymphocytes. As a result, PC@GCpD(Gd) achieved robust inhibition efficiency to almost completely suppress the EMT6 murine mammary cancer model under laser irradiation, implying the superior synergy of combined photoimmunotherapy. Moreover, the in vivo delivery and biodistribution of PC@GCpD(Gd) could be tracked using the high-quality bimodal magnetic resonance imaging/fluorescence imaging. This study highlighted the potent prospect of hybrid PC@GCpD(Gd) nanoassemblies for precise cancer photoimmunotherapy with a cascading effect.

The rGO-In2O3 composites exhibited enhanced sensing performance towards NO2 through comparison with the pure In2O3 sample. The operating temperature can be tuned by the percentage of rGO in the composites. The sensor based on 5 wt% rGO-In2O3 could work at room temperature with a high response value to 1 ppm NO2. 3 wt% rGO-In2O3 composite was adopted for the ultra-sensitivity gas sensor owing to its extremely low limit of detection of 10 ppb with rapid response time to NO2. The sensor also exhibited excellent selectivity and stability. The ultra-sensitivity of rGO-In2O3 should be related to synergistic effect of the hierarchical structure of In2O3 and the presence of rGO in the composites, which provided enhanced surface area and local p-n heterojunctions in rGO/In2O3 composites.

J	Wu, J; He, GC; Fei, HL				Wu Jun; He Guanchao; Fei Huilong			Self-supported Film Electrodes Decorated with Single Atoms for Energy Electrocatalysis	CHEMICAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE UNIVERSITIES-CHINESE			Chinese	Article						Self-supported electrode; Single-atom catalyst; Energy electrocatalysis	CO2; EFFICIENT; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; REDUCTION; CATALYSIS; METAL	Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely studied in energy electrocatalysis due to their high catalytic activity, excellent selectivity and maximized atom utilization efficiency. However, the powdery SACs were mostly evaluated at small current densities (typically<100 mA/cm(2)) with low electrode loading (typically<1.0 mg/cm(2)) due to the complex preparation process of the working electrode, the addition of polymeric binder that would decrease the electrical conductivity and bury the active sites. In contrast, self-supported single-atom film electrodes not only possess the merits of SACs, but also have the advantages of monolithic structure, such as the omission of polymeric and conductive additives, improved electrical conductivity, enhanced exposure of single-atom sites and adjustable morphology and porosity, making them highly promising to be applied in high-current-density catalytic reactions and high-energy/power-density batteries. In this review, the recent advances of self-supported film-based SACs in energy electrocatalysis are presented. Firstly, the advantages of self-supported film-based SACs are discussed. Subsequently, their synthetic approaches are summarized, including in situ preparation on a self-supported substrate, electrostatic spinning, self-assembly, chemical vapor deposition and solid phase diffusion. Then, the applications of self-supported film-based SACs in various energy-related electrocatalytic processes are introduced, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, H2O2 electrosynthesis, zinc-air batteries, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and lithium sulfur batteries. Finally, the development direction of self-supported film-based SACs is prospected.

The uniform ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter less than 10 nm were uniformly anchored on a nitrogen-doped conductive GN matrix to form a ZnO-GN hybrid. Moreover, various ZnO-GN hybrids with different ZnO loading amounts are fabricated by changing the dosage of Zn(OH)(2). When used as an anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the hybrid showed unprecedentedly enhanced cycling stability and rate performance. More remarkably, the optimized ZnO-GN hybrid achieved an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 900 mA h g(-1), close to the theoretical capacity (978 mA h g(-1)) of ZnO after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), which so far has been proved to be the best result among all ZnO-GN-based electrode materials. As a result, we attributed the excellent performance to the incorporation of the conductive nitrogen-doped GN matrix and the synergetic effect between GN sheets and ZnO NPs.

Herein, we report a facile and effective method to fabricate 3D porous structured carbon with N and S co-doping. As anode material, the co-doped porous carbon exhibits a high reversible capacity of 260 mA h g(-1) after 1000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1). Even at a very high rate of 10 A g(-1), the capacity can still reach 172 mA h g(-1), indicative of an excellent rate capability. These results demonstrate the synergistic effect is beneficial for the sodium storage performance in N, S co-doped 3D nanoporous carbon. Furthermore, the first principles calculations further confirm the synergistic effect from N, S co-doping, which not only promotes electronegativity of carbon and enhances the absorption of Na+ ions, but also decreases the diffusion barrier for better mobility of sodium. The co-doping carbon with 3D hierarchical porous structure can greatly provide enough paths for the permeation of electrolyte, and modify the interlayer of carbon, leading to an enhanced sodium storage performance.

Such PHCBs are composed of porous hollow carbon spheres with a size of similar to 70 nm and shells of similar to 12 nm thickness interconnected to each other. Instrumental analysis shows that the porous shell of the PHCBs could effectively disperse and sequester most of the selenium, while the inner cavity remains hollow. When evaluated as cathode materials in a carbonate-based electrolyte for Li-Se batteries, the Se/PHCBs composites exhibit significantly excellent cycling performance and a high rate capability. Especially, the Se/PHCBs composite with an optimal content of similar to 50 wt% selenium (Se-50/PHCBs) displays a reversible discharge capacity of 606.3 mA h g(-1) after 120 cycles at 0.1 C charge-discharge rate. As the current density increased from 0.1 to 1 C (678 mA g(-1)), the reversible capacity of the Se-50/PHCBs composite can still reach 64% of the theoretical capacity (431.9 mA h g(-1)). These outstanding electrochemical features should be attributed to effective sequestration of Se in the PHCBs, as well as to the ability to accommodate volume variation and enhance the electronic transport by making Se have close contact with the carbon framework.

The discharge capacity of AC-Cu electrode which reached 510 mAh/g after 3 84 cycles, is much higher than that of the CNT-Cu electrodes. The plateau of discharge potential for AC-Cu electrode was very long and flat and reached -0.88 V vs. Hg/HgO, which was far from the potential of copper oxidation. The discharge plateau gradually appeared and continually lengthened with the increase of cycle number. Cyclic voltammetric experiments showed that the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen occurred on the surface of activated carbon and the active site increased with the increase of cycle number. The mechanism for electrochemical storage of hydrogen in AC-Cu electrode may be mainly physisorption. (c) 2004 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that the weight loss ratio, IPDF, and E of T700 carbon fiber epoxy and its residues in the third and fourth layers are similar under the nonvibration plus nonscrubbing airflow and vibration, and the thermal stability under the vibration condition is slightly stronger. In addition, the weight loss ratio, IPDF, and E of the epoxy and its residues in materials are also similar under scrubbing airflow and vibration plus scrubbing airflow, and the thermal stability under vibration plus scrubbing airflow is better. However, it is significantly less than the thermal stability of materials under nonvibration plus nonscrubbing airflow and vibration. Therefore, it can be found that the vibration exacerbates the flame severity and the scrubbing airflow has a significant cooling effect on the material during the airworthiness fire protection test, which have guiding significance on the airworthiness fire prevention items formulation of carbon fiber composite.

Porous 3D graphene aerogels (GA) were prepared by hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The morphology of GO and GA was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy respectively. The functional groups of GO and GA were characterized by Electron Microscopy and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy. The PETE properties of the samples were tested by a self-made device. Thermoelectron emission can be detected when the energy density of the excitation laser was higher than 35 W. The efficiency of the device was between 8.14 x 10(-6)% and 1.89 x 10(-5)%, and the output voltage was about 1 V. Compared with 3D graphene powder and 2D graphene in the control group, GA has more significant and stable thermionic emission properties. GA is a promising cathode material for a PETE solar energy converter, and the conductivity of GA should be further optimized.

Role of carbon defects in the reversible alloying states of red phosphorus composite anodes for efficient sodium ion batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; ENERGY-STORAGE; NANOTUBE COMPOSITE; GRAPHENE; NA; CATHODES; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; CONFINEMENT; ELECTRODES	Here we report the first mechanistic study investigating the effect of carbon defects on the evolution of different sodium-red phosphorus (red P) alloy states for stable high capacity sodium ion battery anodes. Using tunable sp(2)/sp(3) carbon composites containing controlled single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and single-walled carbon nanohorn (SWCNH) compositions, we identify potentials over which both stable and unstable alloying of red P occurs with sodium. Examination of the stable alloy region includes both NaP and Na5P4 formation that occurs between 0.40 and 0.15 V where alloying is mostly independent of the carbon composite matrix chemistry. However, an unstable region corresponding to Na3P formation below 0.15 V results in capacity degradation that directly correlates with the density of carbon defects. In the unstable region, defects are observed to initiate deep alloying and poor reversibility due to the formation of irreversible Na3P products that form over the carbon surface. Our results present a mechanistic roadmap to guide the design of red P-carbon composite anodes to approach high theoretical sodium ion capacity (2596 mA h g(-1)) while simultaneously addressing chemical interactions that compromise performance stability.

It also has the advantages of low-cost and environmental-friendly preparation. In this work, carbon dots were employed as dopants for modification of hierarchical litchi-like In2O3 nanospheres via a facile and environment-friendly hydrothermal approach to improve the gas sensing properties. As-obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, etc. Gas sensing properties of In2O3/carbon dots and pristine In2O3 were investigated systematically. As expected, the sensors based on the In2O3/carbon dots displayed enhanced response at working temperature of 50 degrees C, which was 4 times as high as the sensors based on the pristine In2O3. The sensors presented excellent selectivity. The enhancement of sensing properties should be mainly attributed to the heterojunctions constructed across the interface between the In2O3 and carbon quantum dots.

J	Wu, J; He, GC; Fei, HL				Wu Jun; He Guanchao; Fei Huilong			Self-supported Film Electrodes Decorated with Single Atoms for Energy Electrocatalysis	CHEMICAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE UNIVERSITIES-CHINESE			Chinese	Article						Self-supported electrode; Single-atom catalyst; Energy electrocatalysis	PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENT; CO2; DESIGN; METAL; REDUCTION; CATALYSIS	Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely studied in energy electrocatalysis due to their high catalytic activity, excellent selectivity and maximized atom utilization efficiency. However, the powdery SACs were mostly evaluated at small current densities(typically<100 mA/cm(2)) with low electrode loading(typically<1.0 mg/cm(2)) due to the complex preparation process of the working electrode, the addition of polymeric binder that would decrease the electrical conductivity and bury the active sites. In contrast, self-supported single-atom film electrodes not only possess the merits of SACs, but also have the advantages of monolithic structure, such as the omission of polymeric and conductive additives, improved electrical conductivity, enhanced exposure of single-atom sites and adjustable morphology and porosity, making them highly promising to be applied in high-current-density catalytic reactions and high-energy/power-density batteries. In this review, the recent advances of self-supported film-based SACs in energy electrocatalysis are presented. Firstly. the advantages of self-supported film-based SACs are discussed. Subsequently, their synthetic approaches are summarized, including in situ preparation on a self-supported substrate, electrostatic spinning, self-assembly, chemical vapor deposition and solid phase diffusion. Then, the applications of self-supported film-based SACs in various energy-related electrocatalytic processes are introduced, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, H2O2, electrosynthcsis, zinc-air batteries, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and lithium sulfur batteries. Finally, the development direction of self-supported film-based SACs is prospected.

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) dissolved in precursor solution is used as a functional template playing a vital role in structural design. Hierarchical carbon combustion reactions of NiO@CoO@C precursor powder produce yolk-shell structure during the heat-treatment process. Heat treated temperatures can be adjusted to obtain different structured nickel-cobalt oxide microspheres. As a potential anode material for Li-ion batteries, the hierarchical yolk-shell NiCo2O4 microspheres exhibit a large reversible specific capacity of 984 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 1000 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles, representing a high capacity retention of 98.2%. When operating at a current density of 5 A g(-1), it delivers ultrafast charge-discharge performance, exhibiting a high capacity of 813 mAh g(-1). These excellent electrochemical properties very likely originate from characteristic yolk-shell structures, which provide buffer areas for the enormous volume expansion caused by Li-ion insertion/extraction and shorten the diffusion path of Li ions by increasing the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte. This work may serve as a reference for the design of structurally novel functional materials in other advanced energy conversion and storage areas, such as supercapacitors, lithium-sulfur batteries, fuel cells, and Naion batteries.

J	Li, S; Li, GL; Li, GY; Wu, G; Hu, CW				Li, Song; Li, Guolan; Li, Guiying; Wu, Gang; Hu, Changwei			Microporous carbon molecular sieve as a novel catalyst for the hydroxylation of phenol	MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS			English	Article						Carbon molecular sieves; Phenol hydroxylation; Catalysis; Dihydroxybenzene	ACTIVATED CARBON; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; WET OXIDATION; H2O2	A series of microporous carbon-based catalysts were prepared by acidification and/or oxidization treatment of a commercially available carbon molecular sieve (CMS). The resultant samples were characterized by Boehm titration, X-photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), point of zero charge (pH(PZC)) test, N-2 adsorption, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), and employed as catalysts for phenol hydroxylation with H2O2. It is found that the acidic functional groups of CMSs play an important role for the catalytic performance. The effects of solvents, reaction temperature, ratio of phenol/catalyst, ratio of phenol/H2O2 and reaction time were investigated. Over the sample with the strongest surface acidity among the studied CMSs, the phenol conversion, the selectivity to dihydroxybenzene, and the effective utilization of H2O2 reach 29.6%, 85.1% and 80%, respectively under optimal reaction condition. The catalyst is stable in the recycling test. Furthermore, due to its easy physical separation, environmental benignity and low cost, the microporous CMSs is promising for industrial application.

The device has two bulk graphene regions where the carrier type is electrostatically controlled by a top gate, and these two regions are separated by a nanoribbon that works as an insulator, resulting in a junction configuration of (P or N)-I-(P or N). It is demonstrated that the drain current modulation strongly depends on the junction configuration, while the nanoribbon is not directly top-gated, and that the device with a P-I-N or N-I-P junction can exhibit better switching properties.

Density functional theory calculations on the CO catalytic oxidation on Al-embedded graphene	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							REACTION PATHWAYS; GOLD; SIMULATION; REACTIVITY; CLUSTERS; SURFACE; GAS	The oxidation of CO molecules on Al-embedded graphene has been investigated by using the first principles calculations. Both Eley-Rideal (ER) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) oxidation mechanisms are considered. In the ER mechanism, an O-2 molecule is first adsorbed and activated on Al-embedded graphene before a CO molecule approaches, the energy barrier for the primary step (CO + O-2 -> OOCO) is 0.79 eV. In the LH mechanism, O-2 and CO molecules are firstly co-adsorbed on Al-embedded graphene, the energy barrier for the rate limiting step (CO + O-2 -> OOCO) is only 0.32 eV, much lower than that of ER mechanism, which indicates that LH mechanism is more favourable for CO oxidation on Al-embedded graphene. Hirshfeld charge analysis shows that the embedded Al atom would modify the charge distributions of co-adsorbed O-2 and CO molecules. The charge transfer from O-2 to CO molecule through the embedded Al atom plays an important role for the CO oxidation along the LH mechanism. Our result shows that the low cost Al-embedded graphene is an efficient catalyst for CO oxidation at room temperature.	[Jiang, Q.

A practical and eco-friendly deep eutectic solvent-assisted ball milling technique was developed to prepare multi-layer graphene in this study. The expanded graphite was used as raw material, and the deep eutectic solvent was prepared by mixing urea and choline chloride. The obtained graphene was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and Raman spectroscopy. After ball milling for 48 h, most of the graphite particles could be exfoliated into graphene sheets, and no new covalent bond or interaction was formed. Multi-layer graphene in N-methylpyrrolidone had better dispersibility and larger layers than that in N,N-dimethylformamide. The obtained multi-layer graphene exhibited few defects, high crystal integrity, 11-12 layers, 2-5 mu m size at the lateral dimension, and superior thermal stability. This technique of low-energy ball milling in the nontoxic deep eutectic solvents provides a new idea for the efficient exfoliation of multi-layer graphene and also a certain reference value for the exfoliation of other two-dimensional nanosheets.

However, poor cycle efficiency and safety problems relating to dendritic Li growth during cycling should be addressed. Here we propose a strategy to increase the coulombic efficiency of the Li metal electrode. Conductive porous carbon films (CPCFs) were prepared by distributing amorphous carbon nanoparticles within a polymer binder. This porous structure is able to provide enough conductive surfaces for Li deposition and dissolution, which reduce the effective current density. Moreover, the pores in these films enable the electrolyte to easily penetrate into the empty space, and Li can be densely deposited between the carbon particles. As a result, dendritic Li growth can be effectively prevented. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the coulombic efficiency of the porous electrode can be greatly improved compared to that of the pure Cu electrode. By allowing for the development of robust Li metal electrodes, this approach provides key insight into the design of high-capacity anodes for Li metal batteries, such as Li-air and Li-S systems.

MOF-Derived CoS2/N-Doped Carbon Composite to Induce Short-Chain Sulfur Molecule Generation for Enhanced Sodium-Sulfur Battery Performance	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						Room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery; metal-organic frameworks; cobalt disulfide; short-chain sulfur molecules; catalytic activity	FACILE SYNTHESIS; DOPED CARBON; S BATTERIES; LI-S; NANOPARTICLES; ANODE; ELECTRODE; SPHERES	Dissolution of intermediate sodium polysulfides (Na2Sx; 4 <= x <= 8) is a crucial obstacle for the development of room-temperature sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries. One promising strategy to avoid this issue is to load short-chain sulfur (S2-4), which could prohibit the generation of soluble polysulfides during the sodiation process. Herein, unlike in the previous reported cases where short-chain sulfur was stored by confinement within a small-pore-size (<= 0.5 nm) carbon host, we report a new strategy to generate short-chain sulfur in larger pores (>0.5 nm) by the synergistic catalytic effect of CoS2 and appropriate pore size. Based on density functional theory calculations, we predict that CoS2 can serve as a catalyst to weaken the S-S bond in the S-8 ring structure, facilitating the formation of short-chain sulfur molecules. By experimentally tuning the pore size of the CoS2-based hosts and comparing their performances as cathodes in Na-S and Li-S batteries, we conclude that such a catalytic effect depends on the proximity of sulfur to CoS2. This avoids the generation of soluble polysulfides and results in superior electrochemical properties of the composite materials introduced here for Na-S batteries. As a result, the optimized CoS2/N-doped carbon/S electrode showed excellent electrochemical performance with high reversible specific capacities of 488 mA h g(-1) (962 mA h g(s)(-1)) after 100 cycles (0.1 A g(-1)) and 403 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles (1 A g(-1)) with a superior rate performance (262 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1)).

Then, DLC wear debris, which are carbon particles with different sp(2)/sp(3) ratios and sizes ranging from the nano- to micro-meter scale produced. In this paper, to promote the application of DLC coating for artificial joint modification, the cytotoxicity of DLC debris (nano-carbon particles, NCs) with different sp(2)/sp(3) ratios was studied. The microstructure and physical characteristics of NCs with different sp(2)/sp(3) ratios were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Meanwhile, osteoblasts and macrophages were applied to characterize the cytotoxicity of the NCs. In vitro cytotoxicity assay results indicated that cells incubated with NCs of different sp(2)/sp(3) ratios had greater osteogenic capacity, and these particles caused a weaker immune response in comparison with CoCrMo particles. Taken together, the results indicated that NCs with different sp(2)/sp(3) ratios presented a good cytocompatibility than CoCrMo particles. But no significant differences were observed among NCs with different sp(2)/sp(3) ratios. The better cytocompatibility of NCs is mainly attributable to their surface charge. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, densely distributed magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were successfully attached onto the convex surfaces of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by an in situ polyol-medium solvothermal method via non-covalent functionalization of CNTs with cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and anionic polyelectrolyte, poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), through the polymer-wrapping technique, in which the negatively charged PSS-grafted CNTs can be used as primer for efficiently adsorption of positively metal ions on the basis of electrostatic attraction. X-ray diffractometry (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis have been used to study the formation of Fe3O4/CNTs. The Fe3O4/CNTs nanocomposites were proved to be superparamagnetic with saturation magnetization of 43.5 emu g(-1). A mechanism scheme was proposed to illustrate the formation process of the magnetic nanocomposites. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Briefly, GO played a role in quenching the fluorescent group of specific aptamer in the absence of OTA. However, the fluorescence restoration could be observed in the presence of OTA based on the sensing platform. Therefore, through utilizing bare GO and optimizing the detective conditions, the detection limit of this unmodified biosensor was preliminarily obtained to be 886.7 nM with a linear detection range from 1 mu M to 20 mu M. Above all, to avoid the nonspecific adsorption of OTA on the surface of GO and improve the sensitivity of the sensor, surface blockers (Tween 20, CTAB, and oligonucleotides) were used to modify GO in this investigation. And Tween 20 was finally selected as the suitable surface blocker by comparing their experimental data. Based on this fact, the Tween 20 modified sensing platform reveals a lower detection limit to 3.12 nM, and shows a strong linear relationship within the detection range from 5 nM to 200 nM (R-2 = 0.997). Results of this study also demonstrated that the detecting platform exhibited excellent selectivity for OTA against other fungi toxins. In addition, this purposed assay was challenged by testing food samples that contained buffer solution spiked with different concentrations of OTA. These results indicate that this method has a promising analytical application in food detection.

A highly ordered nanostructured carbon-sulphur cathode for lithium-sulphur batteries	NATURE MATERIALS			English	Article							MESOPOROUS MATERIALS; HIGH-CAPACITY; ELECTROLYTE; POLYSULFIDES; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS; ADSORPTION; CELL	The Li-S battery has been under intense scrutiny for over two decades, as it offers the possibility of high gravimetric capacities and theoretical energy densities ranging up to a factor of five beyond conventional Li-ion systems. Herein, we report the feasibility to approach such capacities by creating highly ordered interwoven composites. The conductive mesoporous carbon framework precisely constrains sulphur nanofiller growth within its channels and generates essential electrical contact to the insulating sulphur. The structure provides access to Li+ ingress/egress for reactivity with the sulphur, and we speculate that the kinetic inhibition to diffusion within the framework and the sorption properties of the carbon aid in trapping the polysulphides formed during redox. Polymer modification of the carbon surface further provides a chemical gradient that retards diffusion of these large anions out of the electrode, thus facilitating more complete reaction. Reversible capacities up to 1,320m Ah g(-1) are attained. The assembly process is simple and broadly applicable, conceptually providing new opportunities for materials scientists for tailored design that can be extended to many different electrode materials.

I use these coalfields as a vantage point from which to examine the emerging dynamics of climate change and rentier capitalism in the rural Global North. Studying one valley on the Kentucky-Tennessee border where coal mining has largely ended, I document how emergent land uses take the form of rentier capitalism. I conclude that rentier dynamics articulated with deindustrialization have created the conditions for right-wing populism to emerge, in part in response to the experience of becoming 'surplus population,' drawing upon Tania Li's framework.

Insights into the individual role of the various chemical nitrogen functionalities in the H2O2 production, however, have remained scarce. Here, we explore a catalytically very active family of nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials, prepared by direct pyrolysis of ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) with polyethylenimine (PEI). Voltam-metric rotating ring-disk analysis in combination with chronoamperometric bulk electrolysis measurements in electrolysis cells demonstrate a pronounced effect of the applied potentials, current densities, and electrolyte pH on the H2O2 selectivity and absolute production rates. H2O2 selectivity up to 95.3% was achieved in acidic environment, whereas the largest H2O2 production rate of 570.1 mmol g(catalyst)(-1)h(-1) was observed in neutral solution. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) analysis suggests a key mechanistic role of pyridinic-N in the catalytic process in acid, whereas graphitic-N groups appear to be catalytically active moieties in neutral and alkaline conditions. Our results contribute to the understanding and aid the rational design of efficient carbon-based H2O2 production catalysts.

However, further improvements are needed which are underpinned by advances in conventional electrode designs. This paper reviews conventional and emerging electrode designs, including conventional LIB electrode modification techniques and electrode design for next-generation energy devices. Thick electrode designs with low tortuosity are the most conventional approach for energy density improvement. Chemistries such as lithium-sulfur, lithium-air and solid-state batteries show great potential, yet many challenges remain. Microscale structural modelling and macroscale functional modelling methods underpin much of the electrode design work and these efforts are summarized here. More importantly, this paper presents a novel framework for next-generation electrode design termed: Cyber Hierarchy And Interactional Network based Multiscale Electrode Design (CHAIN-MED), a hybrid solution combining model-based and data-driven techniques for optimal electrode design, which significantly shortens the development cycle. This review, therefore, provides novel insights into combining existing design approaches with multiscale models and machine learning techniques for next-generation LIB electrodes.

Therefore, ingenious design of hierarchical structures through the mimicking of natural systems is of increasing importance. Currently, there is an urgent need for creation of multidimensional carbonaceous structures by integrating a customized hierarchical pore architecture and hybrid carbon framework. Here we report the pioneering fabrication of novel super-hierarchical carbons with a unique carbonaceous hybrid nanotube-interconnected porous network structure by utilizing well-defined carbon nanotube@polystyrene bottlebrushes as building blocks. Hypercrosslinking of such heterogeneous core-shell structured building blocks not only allows for constructing amorphous microporous carbon shells on the surface of graphitic carbon nanotube cores, but also leads to formation of covalently interconnected nanoscale networks. Benefiting from such a well-orchestrated structure, these super-hierarchical carbons exhibit good electrochemical performances. Our findings may open up a new avenue for fabrication of unique and unusual functional carbon materials which possess well-orchestrated structural hierarchy and thus generate valuable breakthroughs in many applications including energy, adsorption, separation, catalysis and medicine.

Anti-wear hierarchical TiC enhanced cermet coating obtained via electrical discharge coating using a reduced graphene oxide nanosheets mixed dielectric	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Electrical discharge coating; Graphene; Powder mixed dielectric; Cermet coating; Wear resistance	SURFACE MODIFICATION; TRIBOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; TOOL STEEL; COMPOSITE LAYER; MICROSTRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHITE; ART	The use of a powder mixed dielectric is one of the promising measures to overcome defects such as non-uniform thickness, voids and micro-cracks of hard coatings obtained via the electrical discharge coating (EDC) process. The quest for finding appropriate powders suspended in EDC dielectric still continues. In this paper, reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (RGONS) are explored as the additives of EDC dielectric to fabricate TiC containing composite coatings with superior tribological performance. The influences of RGONS on the surface integrity, microstructure and tribological performance of the as-prepared coatings are investigated. RGONS with lipophilic modification effectively reduce spark energy and disperse the discharges throughout the machined surface due to their uniform dispersion in the discharge gap. This allows the formation of compact coatings with banded microstructure composing of a mixture of equiaxed and columnar TiC grains within the martensite matrix. Such unique microstructure improves the as-prepared coatings' resistance to adhesion and abrasion wear, as well as fatigue and fracture. As a result, they show obviously lower coefficient of friction and wear rate compared to the coatings obtained using a bare dielectric.	[Li, S. L.; Mai, Y. J.; Huang, M. Y.; Jie, X.

The formation and evolution of Al4C3, AlN and SiC crystalline phases in the matrix contribute to the excellent properties of such materials, namely high thermal conductivity and low mean pore diameter of open pores. The experimental results indicate that about 2-4 wt-%Al plus about 4-6 wt-% Si additions at similar to 1300 degrees C were optimum for the manufacture of carbon refractories.

To explore the sensitivity of LOCF and their enzymatic conversion under straw mulch for scientific management of crop straw use on the Chengdu plain, a straw mulch field experiment was conducted to observe the LOCF changes and explore their relationships with C-cycle enzymes during wheat growth. The treatments included no fertilizer or straw (Control), only mineral fertilizer (MF), 10% rice straw nitrogen (N) plus 90% fertilizer N (RS1), 20% rice straw N plus 80% fertilizer N (RS2), 30% rice straw N plus 70% fertilizer N (RS3), 100% rice straw (RS). The water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) under straw treatments in the 0-20 cm soil layer were significantly higher than those of Control and MF treatments from the seedling stage, and showed significant differences among straw treatments from the tillering stage. Correspondingly, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and permanganate oxidized carbon (POXC) showed no obvious differences among straw treatments in most growth stages. Therefore, WSOC and MBC were the most sensitive indicators for assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) change under straw mulch. Moreover, stepwise multiple linear regression revealed that cellulase and beta-glucosidase were significantly positive impact factors for LOCF in the two soil layers, while polyphenol oxidase had both positive and negative impacts on WSOC at different soil layers, and peroxidase was a negative factor for LOCF.

Among various energy storage devices, carbon serves as a predominant choice of electrode material owing to abundance, electrical conductivity, and control over the intrinsic properties. In this context, biomass, an abundant, inexpensive, and renewable source to produce biochars has gained significant research attention not only to mitigate the environmental concern, but also to promote the development of sustainable energy storage applications. In this review, recent progresses towards the conversion and efficient utilization of biomass and its derived biochar as electrode materials for energy storage devices, including supercapacitors and batteries (Li-ion, Na-ion, Li-S, and Metal-air) is summarized and discussed. The various sources of biomass, processes to derive biochar from the biomass, and the effects of various parameters involved in the synthesis methods to tailor its morphology, surface area, pore structure, and composition of the biochars along with the structure-activity relationship and technology-to-market is elaborated, which will lead to remarkable exploration of biomass towards realizing sustainable energy storage devices.

Reducing CO2 emissions is one of the major ways to achieve carbon neutrality and control air temperature rise. So far, numerous countries have pledged their goals of achieving carbon neutrality. In September 2020, China proposed a national dual-carbon goal and the associated timeline to achieve peak carbon and carbon neutrality. Therefore, how the proposal will lead to future changes in air quality and climate in China is of great interest. In the context of the dual-carbon goal, a series of emission reduction policies for different types of industries will be implemented to achieve CO3 reductions. As a result, emissions of other pollutants will be reduced as well. Furthermore. future global climate change is also one of the main concerns. Most previous studies have focused on one single impacting factor without consideration of the dual-carbon goal. While carbon neutrality is an inevitable global trend. studies of its implication on air quality and climate change in China are still rare. Considering both regional emissions and global climate change will help predict future climate. Taking the dualcarbon goal into account will help adjust current emission reduction policies. In this study, we simulate the impacts of both regional emissions and global climate change in the future on China's air quality and climate in the future under the dualcarbon goal scenario using a regional climate-ecology coupled model RegCM-Chem-YIBs, based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5) climate scenario and China's 2030 emission data based on dynamics projection model (DPEC). Numerical simulations for present climate and present emissions, present climate and future emissions, and future climate and future emissions were performed. The comparison between the three sets of simulations provides how future regional emission reduction and global climate change will affect air pollution and climate in 2030. The study shows that, compared with 2015, the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). ozone (O-3), and carbon dioxide (CO2) in China will decrease by approximately 36.8, 19.8 mu g m(3) and 1.9 ppm in 2030, respectively, under the combined effect of future regional emissions and global climate change. The temperature in the southern part of China will increase significantly, with an increase between 0.5 and 1.5 K. Precipitation and clouds decrease by 1-2 mm d(-1) and 3%-6%. respectively. The temperature in the northern part decreases slightly, generally below 1 K. Precipitation and clouds increase by approximately 2 mm d(-1 )and 6%, respectively. Overall, regional emission changes have a larger impact on PM2.5, O-3 and CO2 concentrations. which are the main influencing factors for future air quality changes, while global climate change has a greater impact on temperature, clouds and precipitation. Emission reduction policies under the dual-carbon target will significantly reduce air pollution. but may exacerbate warming at the surface because these policies will inevitably diminish the cooling effect of particulate matter. The mitigation of climate change will require GHG (greenhouse gas) and air pollution synergistic emission reduction policies and worldwide cooperation.

Based on the traditional twin reactor configuration, a novel bubbling twin reactor is proposed to improve the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol in this work. The multiphysical model for the bubbling twin reactor is developed and numerically simulated. The variations of the methanol production with the gas inlet flow velocity and gas inlet number are obtained. The results show that the bubbling twin reactor has a higher carbon dioxide conversion efficiency than, the traditional one. Moreover, the methanol production subsequently increases as the gas inlet velocity increases. With the constant inlet gas volumetric flow rate, the production of methanol can,be improved by increasing the gas inlet number.

On one hand, HIO3 is a weak solid-state acid and can be easily handled to remove most ion insulating residues like Li2CO3 and/or LiOH from the pristine Li surface; on the other hand, both the products of Lil and LiIO3 resulted from the chemical reactions between Li metal and HIO3 are reported to be the ion-conductive components. As a result, the lower voltage polarization and impedance, longer cycling lifetime and higher Coulombic efficiency have been successfully achieved in the HIO3-treated Li-Li and Li-Cu cells. By further using the HIO3-treated Li anode into practical Li-S batteries, the impressive results also have been obtained, with average discharge capacities of 719 mAh g(-1) for 200 cycles (0.2 C) and 506 mAh g(-1) for 500 cycles (0.5 C), which were better than the Li-S batteries using the pristine Li anode (552 and 401 mAh g-1, respectively) under the same conditions.

Here, we propose that, due to the electron correlation, the BGM can be induced into a half-metallic phase by applying a vertical electric field and doping. The half-metallic states in even-layer and odd-layer BGMs have totally different behaviors due to their different band structures. We systematically calculate the graphene tetralayer (4L-BGM) and trilayer (3L-BGM) as typical examples of even layer and odd-layer BGMs, respectively. In 4L-BGMs, we find an interesting phenomenon of electric field induced inversion of the spin-polarized bands, namely, in the half-metallic phase, the spin polarization of the conducting channel and the net magnetic moment are inversed when the applied electric field exceeds a critical value. In 3L-BGMs, a remarkable feature is that the inequivalence of the two sublattices will intrinsically break the degeneracy of the spin-up and spin-down bands even in the zero electric field case. Our results suggest that 4L-BGM could be an ideal platform to detect the proposed half-metallic phase in BGM systems.

In this paper, transition metal (cobalt) N-doped carbon nanomaterials derived from metal-organic framework (MOFs) were synthesized by calcination of ZIF-67 precursors at high temperature (Co@NCNTs). Nitrogen atoms were introduced into the carbon matrix by capturing volatile CNx from di-cyandiamide, and porous carbon nanotube structures with N-doped and uniformly dispersed active sites were obtained. The effects of different carbonization temperatures and molar ratio of Co/2-MI on the catalytic activity of materials for ORR reaction were studied. It was found that the Co@NCNTs prepared at 700 degrees C with the ratio of cobalt metal to dimethylimidazole of 1: 8 shows excellent ORR activity in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. In alkaline conditions, the half-wave potential E-1/2 = 0.81 V, initial potential E-onset = 0.89 V, and limiting current density even reaching 7.4 mA cm(-2). And in acidic electrolytes, E-1/2 = 0.66 V, while the limiting current density is 6.4 mA cm(-2), which is still better than that of Pt/C. Its excellent ORR performance is due to the synergistic effect of the porous carbon nanotube structure, N-doped carbon and Co-Nx active sites. Meanwhile, the optimum catalyst also shows better stability and methanol resistance than Pt/C in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Carbon Nanotubes as Effective Interlayer for High Performance Li-I-2 Batteries: Long Cycle Life and Superior Rate Performance	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIAL; SEPARATOR; LAYER	Highly soluble active materials, such as iodine, are of great potential to develop the research of rapid charge-discharge performance for Li-ion batteries. In this work, a new facile method is applied to construct the iodine/carbon electrode system, which is composed of a thin cathode film, prepared by directly mixing pure commercial iodine and superconducting carbon black, and a carbon nanotubes (CNTs) interlayer. The CNTs interlayer is inserted between pure iodine cathode and separator in the lithium-iodine battery. Electrochemical data reveals that the iodine cathode demonstrates a high capacity of 100 mAh g(-1) and similar to 100% columbic efficiency after 5000 cycles at a rate of 100C, which shows a great cycle stability and superior high-rate capability, based on the contributions from both the confinement effect of iodine species in CNTs interlayer and the quick liquid-phase diffusion of Li ions in Li-I-2 battery.

The mesoporous carbon-supported iron catalysts were prepared through the co-precipitation from aqueous solutions of ferrous and copper sulfates in the presence of mesoporous carbon materials synthesized through the soft-template and hard-template methods. The iron catalyst supported by the soft-templated mesoporous carbon exhibited a sharp product distribution at C5-C9 fractions (62 % in hydrocarbons) in FT synthesis at 260 degrees C under 2 MPa-G. On the other hand, the catalyst supported by the hard-templated mesoporous carbon having far larger mesopore openings showed a high selectivity to higher hydrocarbons (69 % of C10+ in hydrocarbons) with a high hydrocarbon productivity (0.74 g/g-Fe h). This catalyst also showed high catalytic activity and long lifetime up to 30 h even at lower reaction pressure of 1 MPa-G. The very large inner space of mesopores that are not easily blocked through the wax formation would be responsible for such high catalytic activity.

Poor cycle life and low capacity retention are main issues restraining their commercialization. To achieve high energy density, metallic lithium or concentrated alloy negatives are required wherein both the challenge of high reactivity leading to degradation, and safety issues have to be dealt with. LiNO3 has been reported as an electrolyte additive to produce passivation layer on the metallic lithium anode. However, the passivation layer thickness cannot be controlled. In order to have similar passivation effect with controlled thickness and to avoid undesirable reaction on the surface of the lithium metal, Li3N protective layers has been investigated. This study demonstrates the effect of coating techniques and feasibility of Li3N protective layers for Li metal anodes in Li-S cells using just a standard sulphur/carbon composite electrode, thereby independent from the effects of binders or any porous cathode architecture. A first approach to study the surface morphology of Li with Li3N layers in Li-S batteries has been made. Improved cycling efficiency and good lithium plating/stripping characteristics were observed with a smooth surface morphology of Li metal. A viable in-situ approach of depositing Li3N layer on the Li metal anode using ([(CH3)(3)SiN3]) as electrolyte additive is proposed.

Capacity fading due to polysulfide shuttle and corrosion of lithium metal are directly connected with the type and quantity of electrolyte used in the cells. Several recent works show dependence of the electrochemical behavior of Li-S batteries on type of the electrolyte. In this work we compare and discuss a discharge mechanism of sulfur conversion in three different electrolytes based on measurements with sulfur K-edge XAS. The sulfur conversion mechanism in the ether based electrolytes, the most studied type of solvents in the Li-S batteries, which are enabling high solubility of polysulfides are compared with the fluorinated ether based electrolytes with a reduced polysulfide solubility and in carbonate based electrolytes with the sulfur confined into a ultramicroporous carbon. In all three cases the sulfur reduction proceeds through polysulfide intermediate phases with a difference on the type polysulfides detected at different steps of discharge. (C) The Author(s) 2017.

Surface modification treatment by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) on the near-beta non-toxic Ti3Zr-2Sn-3Mo-25 Nb (TLM) titanium alloy was conducted, graphene oxide (GO) was used as modified additive to improve the comprehensive performances especially the ability of inducing hydroxyapatite. The influence of GO particles on the structure, composition and performance were measured and analyzed. Results showed that, GO was successfully participated in the coating formation process, some micropores and cracks were sealed and diminished, reduced the surface roughness. Even though the thickness was decreased, the density was significantly increased. In addition, the critical load strength increased 34%, and lowered the friction coefficient 50%. The electrochemical measurements proved that GO has gain effect on the corrosion resistance of the MAO coating. After immersed in SBF, more HA phase was formed on GO MAO coating, showing more promising biocompatibility. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we present a gas-solid interface reaction approach for one-step synthesis of fluorine-doped hierarchical porous hollow carbon nanospheres (FPHCs) controlled by employing SiO2 or Si spheres as a sacrificial template, and Teflon as a carbon, fluorine, and etching gas source. The afforded FPHCs feature an ultrahigh pore volume of up to 7.16 cm(3) g(-1), which is the highest pore volume for porous hollow carbons reported so far, tunable hierarchical pore sizes, and a high fluorine-doping content, endowing them with excellent electrochemical performance in high-sulfur-content Li-S batteries. This novel approach may open up new horizons to construct ultrahigh-pore-volume functional porous hollow carbons for sustainable energy applications.

According to elemental analysis, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the hydrogen content and the degree of graphitization in S@pPAN composites decreases with increasing synthesis vapor pressure, indicating that a suitably high vapor pressure is helpful in promoting the reaction between polyacrylonitrile and elemental sulfur and finally making the conductive molecular structure of sulfurized polyacrylonitrile more complete. The results show that the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile composite prepared under 5 MPa vapor pressure (S@pPAN-5) delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1821 mA h g(-1) and the capacity remains at 1357 mA h g(-1) (616.8 mA h g(composite)(-1)) after 100 cycles with a retention rate of 88% calculated from the 2nd discharge capacity.

Long-pulse-width laser heated nickel powder suspended in pure ethanol into liquid droplets. In turn, the latter droplets became sphere-like, pyrolyzed surrounding ethanol and dissolved the produced carbon atoms. Because of their lower solubility in solid nickel, excess carbon atoms were then expelled from the metal core after solidification, thus forming graphite-like shells on the laser-modified Ni spheres. Hence, after pyrolysis the transformation of carbon was found to follow the dissolution-precipitation mechanism. The produced carbon-encapsulated nickel microspheres exhibited higher oxidation resistance compared with the initial nickel powder, while keeping their magnetic properties essentially unchanged.

The pursuit of ultrahigh surface area while maintaining definite nanostructure remains a formidable challenge because extensive creation of pores will undoubtedly give rise to the damage of nanostructures, especially below 100 nm. Here we report that high surface area of up to 3,022 m(2) g(-1) can be achieved for hollow carbon nanospheres with an outer diameter of 69 nm by a simple carbonization procedure with carefully selected carbon precursors and carbonization conditions. The tailor-made pore structure of hollow carbon nanospheres enables target-oriented applications, as exemplified by their enhanced adsorption capability towards organic vapours, and electrochemical performances as electrodes for super-capacitors and sulphur host materials for lithium-sulphur batteries. The facile approach may open the doors for preparation of highly porous carbons with desired nanostructure for numerous applications.

The most widely used methods used to prepare these materials are template-based routes, however, the operating procedures are tedious and the mechanism of their formation is still unclear. Here, we have designed a new protocol to synthesize nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres by preparing and post-treating nanospheres with area-specific distribution, guided by solubility control throughout the entire synthetic process. The hollow inner structure was formed based on the reversibility of chemical reactions without any template assistance. The forming mechanisms of novel solid polymer spheres and the hollow structure have been investigated. The size, morphology and shell thickness of the spheres could be tuned by changing the amount of reactants, the ratio of acetone/water and a subsequent treatment process. Furthermore, the nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres exhibited both high stability and capacity as a Li-S battery cathode with a capacity of 528 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5C.

Herein, we demonstrate an effective strategy to realize accurate tuning gradient heteroatom N and P doping in MOF-derived porous carbon in C@N-C@N,P-C graded heterostructures. Importantly, gradient N and P doping could modify the electronic structure of MOF-derived carbon as certified by DFT calculations, and lead to charge redistribution to induce graded energy levels and a built-in electric field in the C@N-C@N,P-C graded heteroatomic interface, thus boosting interfacial charge transfer and accelerating reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the large surface area and high porosity of C@N-C@N,P-C graded heterostructures could efficiently absorb electrolyte and enhance anion transport kinetics. As expected, the designed gradiently N,P-doped C@N-C@N,P-C heterostructure with a built-in interfacial electric field could facilitate electron and AlCI(4)(- )anion transfer spontaneously between N,P-C, N-C and C gradient components, exhibiting a superior capacity of 98 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 5 A g(-1) after 2500 cycles. This strategy reveals new insights about the gradient energy band for designing high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices.

Herein, we report a strategy to prepare noble metal-decorated porous carbon-based nanomaterials by direct carbonization of porphyrinic metal-organic frameworks of M-PCN-222(Hf) that are also denoted as M-PMOF-2(Hf) (M=Rh, Ir or Pt) at an elevated temperature under an Ar atmosphere. The M-PCN-222(Hf) samples with the nanorod shape are synthesized by the self-assembly of M-TCPP (TCPP=tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) and HfCl4, and the noble metals within the frameworks are uniformly dispersed at the atomic level. Through pyrolysis at 600, 700 or 800 degrees C and followed by acid etching with HF, noble metal-decorated porous carbon-based nanomaterials that are termed as M-PCN-222(Hf)-T (T is the pyrolysis temperature) are obtained, in which the noble metal nanoparticles are dispersed uniformly within the porphyrin ligand-derived nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. Inheriting the structural characteristics of the MOF template, M-PCN-222(Hf)-T display relatively high BET surfaces up to 310 m(2).g(-1)and large mesopores with an average pore diameter around 6 nm. Catalytic results show that the prepared M-PCN-222(Hf)-T samples display high HER catalytic activities in a 0.5 M H(2)SO(4)solution (pH=0.36).

Previous studies mostly focus on ion current rectification, while its correlations with water dynamics are rarely explored. In this work, we analyze the transport of water and ions through asymmetric graphene channels under the drive of electric fields using molecular dynamics simulations. A key observation is that the water flux also exists in the rectification phenomenon that follows the ion flux behaviors because of their dynamical coupling relation in electric fields, and both their rectification ratios exhibit maximum behaviors with the change of the channel opening ratio. This is because the ion dehydration is highly asymmetric for small opening ratios. In addition, the cations and anions have distinct rectification ratios that are strongly dependent on the field strength, where the values for anions can even be 1-2 orders larger. This can be attributed to their different hydration shell and dehydration processes in the graphene channel. The translocation time of ions displays a power law relation with the field strength, in agreement with the prediction by Langevin dynamics. Due to the exclude-volume effect, the occupancy of water and ions shows a clear competition and thus changes in an opposite trend with the field strength. Our results demonstrate the rectification correlations between water and ions, and tuning the geometry of graphene channels provides a simple and robust new route to achieve high rectification ratios.

The Li12Si9 Zintl phase exhibits the NW [ Li 6 Si 5 ] infinity 1 , combined with Y-shaped Si-4 structures. Interestingly, this NW could be assembled from the stacking of the Li6Si5 aromatic cluster. The [ Li 6 Si 5 ] infinity 1 @CNT nanocomposite has been investigated with density functional theory (DFT), including molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. We found that van der Waals interaction between Li's and CNT's walls is relevant for stabilizing this hybrid nanocomposite. This work suggests that nanostructured confinement (within CNTs) may be an alternative to stabilize this free NW, cleaning its properties regarding Li12Si9 solid phase, i.e., metallic character, concerning the perturbation provided by their environment in the Li12Si7 compound.

J	Jiang, W; Xing, XJ; Li, S; Zhang, XW; Wang, WQ				Jiang, Wen; Xing, Xianjun; Li, Shan; Zhang, Xianwen; Wang, Wenquan			Synthesis, characterization and machine learning based performance prediction of straw activated carbon	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Straw activated carbon; Characterization; Co-activation; Machine learning; Performance prediction	RANDOM FOREST MODEL; METHYLENE-BLUE; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; WHEAT-STRAW; DYE REMOVAL; ADSORPTION; REGRESSION; PYROLYSIS; PINEWOOD; WASTES	The research on the preparation of activated carbon co-activated by hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis was uncommon and less experiments used ultrasonic assisted impregnation. The synergistic effect of two catalysts had certain research value. There are still just a few studies on the performance prediction of activated carbon. In this paper, wheat straw, corn straw and sorghum straw were used as the raw materials. ZnCl2 and H3PO4 were used as the catalysts for the synergetic catalysis. Hydrothermal carbonization combined with pyrolysis was used to co-activate with the ultrasonic auxiliary impregnation method in order to prepare straw activated carbon. The straw activated carbon was characterized by different means and the principle of the method was analyzed. Then the performance prediction models of straw pyrolytic activated carbon using methylene blue number and iodine number as the main evaluation index based on Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression were proposed and compared. The results indicated the three kinds of straw showed similar characteristics in the preparation of straw pyrolytic activated carbon whose specific surface area reached 1258.3927 m(2)/g, 1101.8430 m(2)/g and 1060.9723 m(2)/g respectively. The Random Forest Regression model was the most suitable. The n_estimators was set to 10. The evaluation indexes of the model were all good. It demonstrated the three kinds of straw were highly efficient precursor for the preparation of activated carbon used to remove dyes from wastewater. The preparation method in this paper combines the advantages of physical and chemical activation. The prediction model will accelerate the utilization of straw resources, realize the controllable and clean preparation of straw activated carbon and reduce environmental pollution.

In this study, the iron nanoparticles encapsulated by graphene nano-shells which anchored on the surface of carbon substrate (nZVI@gBC) were synthesized by a one-step carbothermal reduction method aided by Tetrahydrofuran. When the mass ratio of carbon source to iron source is 2:3 and the carbothermic reduction temperature is 700 C, stabilized nZVI @gBC can be successfully synthesized with a high iron loading rate of 32.5%. The multilayer graphene shell can effectively prevent the rapid passivation and agglomeration of the nZVI core, and the electronic interaction between the iron nanoparticles core and the graphene carbon shell further enhances the catalytic activity and stability of nZVI@gBC. Therefore, due to the unique structure of graphene nano-shells, nZVI@gBC can be stably stored in the air for more than 80 days. In addition, nZVI@gBC exhibited superior catalytic activity in the experiment of removing 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in groundwater as a persulfate activator. Notably, both the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and quenching tests showed that SO4 & BULL;(-), & BULL;OH, O-2 & BULL;(-) and O-1(2) were both involved in the degradation process of 2,4-DCP, and SO4 & BULL;-were the major active species. Simultaneously, three possible degradation pathways of 2,4-DCP were deduced by GC/MS, which were caused by dechlorination, dehydrogenation or carbon-carbon bond cleavage under the attack of SO4 & BULL;(-), & BULL;OH, O-2 & BULL;(-) and O-1(2). Besides, nZVI@gBC can use the dissolved oxygen in the liquid to generate hydroxyl radicals to effectively remove 2,4-DCP without persulfate. This kind of multifunctional nZVI@gBC may become a promising iron-carbon catalyst for large-scale applications in the field of environmental remediation.

However, many of the active sites introduced by heteroatom doping are hardly accessible within the bulk carbon structure and consequently contribute little to the catalytic activity. Here we report a facile ionic liquid-assisted method for synthesizing mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbons, enabling enrichment of nitrogen atoms at the pore surface, demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature -programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD). The resulting metal-free nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity in HER. The accessible and efficient utilization of nitrogen atoms is responsible for the superior HER catalytic activity.

The Li-C anode material is prepared by a mechanochemical, single step synthesis procedure. The Li-C/electrolyte interface is characterized in terms of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling in comparison with lithium metal, in order to evaluate the improvements in terms of resistance and lithium stripping deposition ability. Li-C anode powder is pressed into a pellet together with the Li2S-P2S5 electrolyte and Li2ZrO3-coated, Li[Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05]O-2 cathode powder (NCA-LZO), to form a new type of solid-state battery operating at room temperature. The Li-C/Li2S-P2S5/NCA-LZO battery shows remarkable cycling performance under galvanostatic conditions, particularly if compared to a more conventional configuration employing lithium metal as the anode. In addition, the all solid-state battery is characterized at various current densities, showing satisfactory rate capability. Under long term-cycling condition, performed at low current and prolonged to more than 250 days, the cell shows a stability over 100 cycles without fading. This is considered a remarkable result suggesting the solid-state cell here studied as suitable candidate-for efficient and safe energy storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Origin of the relatively low transport mobility of graphene grown through chemical vapor deposition	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-QUALITY; SUSPENDED GRAPHENE; FILMS; TEMPERATURE; POLYCRYSTALLINE; NETWORKS; SIZE	The reasons for the relatively low transport mobility of graphene grown through chemical vapor deposition (CVD-G), which include point defect, surface contamination, and line defect, were analyzed in the current study. A series of control experiments demonstrated that the determinant factor for the low transport mobility of CVD-G did not arise from point defects or surface contaminations, but stemmed from line defects induced by grain boundaries. Electron microscopies characterized the presence of grain boundaries and indicated the polycrystalline nature of the CVD-G. Field-effect transistors based on CVD-G without the grain boundary obtained a transport mobility comparative to that of Kish graphene, which directly indicated the detrimental effect of grain boundaries. The effect of grain boundary on transport mobility was qualitatively explained using a potential barrier model. Furthermore, the conduction mechanism of CVD-G was also investigated using the temperature dependence measurements. This study can help understand the intrinsic transport features of CVD-G.	[Song, H.

In this paper, a metal-organic framework {[Zn(1,4-BDC)(0.5)(3-NH2-trz)].(solvent)}(n) was prepared using a solvent method as a precursor to prepare nitrogen self-doped porous carbon ZAPC-T by a direct carbonization, and the effect of different carbonization temperatures on the microstructures, compositions, and electrochemical properties of the nitrogen self-doped porous carbon ZAPC-T samples was investigated. Results showed that the specific surface area of ZAPC-800 reached 728.57 m(2) g(-1) with nitrogen and oxygen contents of 19.09% and 5.93%, respectively. When the carbonization temperature was 800 degrees C, the specific capacitance of ZAPC-800 was 225.4 F g(-1) at a current density of 1.0 A g(-1), and after 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention was as high as 83.01% with constant current charging and discharging. The specific capacitance decay rate was only 21.2% when the current density was increased from 1.0 A g(-1) to 10.0 A g(-1). Thus, nitrogen self-doped porous carbon ZAPC-800 showed excellent electrochemical properties and good cycling stability. This study provides useful experimental data for the preparation of MOF-based nitrogen self-doped porous carbons and their applications.

Here, we introduce LiF to garnet Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LLZT) to increase the stability of the garnet electrolyte against moist air; the garnet LLZT-2 wt% LiF (LLZT-2LiF) has less Li2CO3 on the surface and shows a small interfacial resistance with Li metal, a solid polymer electrolyte, and organic-liquid electrolytes. An all-solid-state Li/polymer/LLZT-2LiF/ LiFePO4 battery has a high Coulombic efficiency and long cycle life; a Li-S cell with the LLZT-2LiF electrolyte as a separator, which blocks the polysulfide transport towards the Li-metal, also has high Coulombic efficiency and kept 93% of its capacity after 100 cycles.

Following a designed sequence, CNTs were coated with aluminium-containing precursor and carbon source, which were dissolved in a mixed solution of isopropanol and toluene; the subsequent pyrolysis and carbothermal nitridation generated AlN layer onto the CNT surface. The coating thickness was tunable from 1 to 2 nm, while maintaining defect free. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the onset oxidizing temperature of the product delayed from 525 to 707 degrees C, and more than 90% CNTs survived the oxidation. Furthermore, the coating mechanism was proposed and verified. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A polymeric shell was observed on the surface of CBlp, which was formed by bound rubber. The chemical structure and content of the bound rubber shell were characterized and quantified, and compared with the commercial carbon black N330 and pyrolytic carbon black (CBp). The average particle size of CBlp is about 22 nm, with a rubber shell thickness of 7-12 nm. Functional carboxylic group and ZnO were detected on the surface of CBlp by FTIR and XRD, respectively, which are absent from N330 and CBp. The core-shell structure of CBlp facilitate the dispersion and interfacial interaction in natural rubber, and lead to a higher reinforcement effect as compared those of N330 and CBp. The light pyrolysis process provides a facile and clean approach to generate useful carbon nanoparticles out of waste tire rubbers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Probing the Extent of Polysulfide Confinement Using a CoNi2S4 Additive Inside a Sulfur Cathode of a Na/Li-Sulfur Rechargeable Battery	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						room temperature sodium-sulfur/lithium-sulfur battery; transition metal sulfide additives; acid-base chemistry; CoNi2S4-S composite cathode; polysulfides traps; in situ Raman/ex situ UV-visible spectroscopy; cyclability and rate capability	SITU RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; LI-S; LITHIUM-POLYSULFIDES; REACTION-MECHANISM; FACILE SYNTHESIS; ION BATTERIES; CHALLENGES; SURFACE; NANOCOMPOSITE	The extent of confinement of soluble metal polysulfides inside a sulfur cathode strongly determines the performance of metal-sulfur rechargeable batteries. This challenge has been largely tackled by loading sulfur inside various conducting porous scaffolds. However, this approach has not proven to be fully effective because of poor chemical interaction between the scaffold and polysulfides. Here, we demonstrate an excellent strategy of using a sulfide additive in the sulfur cathode, viz., cobalt nickel sulfide (CoNi2S4), to efficiently trap the soluble polysulfides inside the sulfur cathode. In situ Raman and ex situ UV-vis spectroscopies clearly reveal higher retention of polysulfides inside CoNi2S4/S compared to bare sulfur and carbon-sulfur mixture cathodes. Against sodium, the CoNi2S4/S assembly showed remarkable cyclability both as a function of current density (at room temperature) and temperature (at constant current density). The versatility of CoNi2S4 is further proven by the exemplary cyclability at various current densities at room temperature against lithium.

The driving capability of BPLCs can be much improved in that the Kerr constant of BPLCs doped with 0.05 wt% G-PANI is increased by similar to 55% compared with that of BPLCs without G-PANI. Meanwhile, this composite exhibits no degradation of electro-optical properties, such as response time, hysteresis and residual birefringence.

Herein, N-doped mesoporous carbons with the surface enriched with abundant oxygen species were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal doping strategy in the self-assembly of phenolic resin, followed with a carbonization process. Direct hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with O-2 as the sole oxidant was effectively catalyzed by these carbons, affording a yield superior or comparable to previous efficient transition metal and even noble metal-based catalysts. The catalyst is facilely recovered and stably reused. The surface carbonyl groups are the active sites for O-2 activation (rate determining step) to generate hydroxyl radicals, which are the reactive oxygen species to oxidize the benzene. This methodology is readily extendable to the oxidation of various other benzene derivatives.

To expand the function of electronic devices with applications in smart health monitoring and treatment, wearable energy-efficient computing, neuroprosthetics, etc., flexible artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing will play a crucial role. Here, carbon nanotube-based ferroelectric synaptic transistors are realized on ultrathin flexible substrates via a low-temperature approach not exceeding 90 degrees C to grow ferroelectric dielectrics in which the single-pulse, pairedpulse, and repetitive-pulse responses testify to well-mimicked plasticity in artificial synapses. The long-term potentiation and long-term depression processes in the device demonstrate a dynamic range as large as 2000x, and 360 distinguishable conductance states are achieved with a weight increase/decrease nonlinearity of no more than 1 by applying stepped identical pulses. The stability of the device is verified by the almost unchanged performance after the device is kept in ambient conditions without additional passivation for 240 days. An artificial neural network-based simulation is conducted to benchmark the hardware performance of the neuromorphic devices in which a pattern recognition accuracy of 95.24% is achieved.

Carbon-coated core-shell Li2S@C nanocomposites as high performance cathode materials for lithiumsulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; SULFUR BATTERIES; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; SULFIDE CATHODE; ION BATTERIES; COMPOSITE; ANODES; CHALLENGES; IMPEDANCE; ENERGY	Li2S has made the concept of Li-S batteries much more promising due to the relatively high storage capacity, the possibility of using Li-free anodes and the increase of microstructural stability. However, similar to S, Li2S also suffers from an insulating nature and polysulfide dissolution problem. The results presented here show a facile and cost-effective approach by using a plasma sparking and chemical sulfurization process to synthesize core-shell Li2S@C nanocomposites. The nanocomposites show a significantly reduced particle size and well-developed core-shell architecture, effectively shortening the Li-ion diffusion distance, enhancing the electronic conductivity and suppressing the dissolution losses of polysulfides. As a result, a much improved rate and cycling performance has been achieved. The method presented in this study offers good opportunities for scaling up the production of high performance cathode materials in a simple and low-cost way to be applied in future generation Li-S batteries.

Hence, a spatially efficient "tube-in-tube" carbonaceous host decorated with defective metallic nitride nanoparticles (Fe2N1-x-NCT25) is constructed and validated to alleviate the abovementioned problems via constructing a highly utilized/volumetric-stabilized sulfur host with multiple electrical/ionic conductive channels. Owing to the presence of spatial confinement and durable catalyzed capability afforded by the as-fabricated hierarchical host, the sulfur cathode delivers a high reversible discharge capacity of 808 mA h g(-1) under the conditions of 1C rate with 90 wt% sulfur content. In addition, a high areal capacity of 5.26 mA h cm(-2), a superb cyclability of 100 cycles and an ultra-low capacity fading rate of 0.013% per cycle are observed at 1C. The reliable LiPS adsorption and administrable LiPS shuttling effect are attributed to the well-developed interactions/conversion between the LiPSs and defective metallic nitride particles, which was further confirmed by theoretical calculations. This work affords the synergistic construction of a structural carbonaceous host for sulfur utilization and an anchored defective catalyst towards rapid and reliable sulfur electrochemistry, leading to enormous prospects in developing applicable LSBs.

In this work, a flexible self-supporting paper of few-wall carbon nanotubes (FVVCNTs) was used as three-dimensional conductive matrices to capture Si and S at -70 mass% without metal foils nor polymeric binders. The full cell comprised of the LixSi-CNT and S-CNT electrodes with a negative to positive (N/P) capacity ratio of similar to 1 realized high initial energy densities of 810 W h kg(-1 )and 680 W h L-1 based on the total mass and volume of the electrodes, respectively. However, the cell showed a poor cycle performance due to the depletion of active Li. The increased N/P capacity ratio of 2.7 drastically improved the cycle performance, realizing an energy density of 610 W h kg(-1) at first discharge and 360 W h kg(-1) after 100 cycles based on the total mass of the electrodes. The full cell architecture based on 3D current collector of FVVCNTs is a promising solution for loading active materials at high fractions and achieving high energy densities at the total electrode level.

However, the irreversible Li plating/striping can reduce the cycling capability and very possibly introduce dendrite growth, thus leading to a series of issues such as infinite volume change, low Coulombic efficiency, and uncontrollable solid electrolyte interphase. Here, we report a novel, single-side Li-infused carbon fiber fabric (LiCFF) with a controllable, minimized Li loading, which shows a highly reversible plating/stripping with an extremely low overpotential of less than 30 mV (Li foil: >1.0 V over 50 cycles) upon >3000 cycles (6000 and 2000 h) at 1 and 3 mA/cm(2) in symmetric cells, respectively. With a high areal capacity up to 10 mA h/cm(2) and a high current density of 10 mA/cm(2), the cell still shows a minimum overpotential of 150-175 mV after 250 cycles (500 h). Full-cell batteries using the LiCFF as "all-in-one" anodes without the additional slurry-making process and nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide (NMC) as cathodes exhibit an improved capacity retention when compared with Li foil: 32% at 0.5 C and 119% at 1.0 C capacity improved after 100 cycles. In parallel, the mossy/dendritic Li on the LiCFF was largely suppressed, which was confirmed using in situ observations of Li plating/striping in a capillary cell. The excellent electronic conductivity of the carbon fabric leads to small contact/transfer resistances of 3.4/3.8 Omega (Li foil: 4.1/44.4 Omega), enabling a drastically lowered energy barrier for Li nucleation/growth. Thus, a uniform current distribution results in forming a homogeneous Li layer instead of forming dendrites. The current LiCFF as the anode with controllable Li (n/p ratio), improved cycling stability, mitigated dendrite formation, and flexibility displays promising applications in versatile Li-metal batteries such as Li-NMC, Li-S, and Li-O-2.

This study aimed to introduce a novel hybrid composition to design a free-standing carbon nanofiber (CNF) based anode by the addition of iron acetylacetonate Fe(AcAc)(3) as active material and TEOS(tetraethoxysilane)/APTES( aminopropyl triethoxysilane) as an additive for Li-ion batteries. Polyacrylonitrile(PAN) was used as the polymer matrix in the spin dope, and the inclusion of Fe (AcAc) 3 and TEOS/APTES resulted in compositional change, producing iron oxide and silica nanoparticles throughout the matrix. Different oxidation states and the presence of embedded iron oxide nanoparticles in CNF were identified by XPS and EDX elemental mapping analysis. PAN-TEOS-APTES-Fe(AcAc)(3) based anode material was capable of enhancing the reversible specific capacity as much as 732 mAhg(-1) at 500 mAg(-1) lasting for 300 cycles, along with the rate capability as high as 815 mAhg(-1) at 200 mAg(-1). Furthermore, EIS analysis and EX-situ FESEM showed decreased impedance after cycling with the stable morphology of PAN-TEOS-APTES-Fe(AcAc)(3) CNF-film. Conclusively, non-woven, binder-free, current collector free, free-standing CNF anode film doped with iron-oxide and silica nanoparticles was indeed a novel approach for Li-ion batteries and can be considered for other batteries particularly for Li-S batteries.

The MC catalysts were characterized by use of Fourier Transform-infrared spectra, N-2 adsorption-desorption, and titration method. The effects of preparation conditions such as carbonization temperature, amount of carbon precursor, sulfonation time, and temperature on the structural and acidic properties of the catalysts were investigated. Preparation conditions such as amount of carbon precursor, sulfonation time, and temperature significantly influenced the surface area and acidic properties of MC catalysts. The activity of prepared catalysts in saccharification was tested using cellulose and rice straw as substrates and high saccharification yield can be obtained using these catalysts. In saccharification of cellulose without pretreatment, the highest yield of 25.2% of C6 monosaccharide can be attained after reaction at 180 degrees C for 3 h. In saccharification of rice straw, the total monosaccharide yield of 43.4% can be achieved after reaction at 150 degrees C for 1 h. In addition, it was found that despite the versatility of mesoporous structure in varied chemical reactions has been confirmed, acid amount was the most important property that determined the effectivity of cellulose saccharification.

Fourier-transform infrared spectra, transmission electron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction were employed to examine the efficiency of surface functionalization of GO. The composite containing P-POSS and modified GO exhibited excellent flame-retardant property and better thermal stability as well as high mechanical property. With the incorporation of 0.6 wt% P-POSS-GO and 4 wt% P-POSS to DBMI, satisfied flame retardant grade V-0 and LOI as high as 39.4 were obtained. The increase of degradation activation energy could be internal reason for the improvement of flame retardancy. Besides, P-POSS-GO can facilitate the growth of oxygen insulation and heat insulation char layer, which could be outer reason for the improvement of flame retardancy.

Yet, its application in PDT is strongly limited by its UV light response range. In this work, TiO2 NPs conjugated with reduced graphene oxide (RGO-TiO2) composites were successfully prepared by hydrothermal reduction method. They were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Superior adsorption and killing efficiency under UV-A light or visible light were achieved in the presence of the RGO rather than that of unmodified TiO2. The optimal photocatalytic activity was obtained when modified proportion was 0.2 (RGO:TiO2). Dark cytotoxicity was observed using 0-500 mu g mL(-1) RGO-TiO2 during long incubation time. In parallel, following exposure of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2 cells) to RGO-TiO2 and UV-A or visible light irradiation, a marked decrease in the ratio of the super-coiled DNA, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and the oxidative damage effects, as well as increased the apoptosis rate and intracellular calcium concentration were observed. Moreover, photocatalytic RGO-TiO2 composites killed the HepG2 cells by apoptosis pathway. The results suggested that RGO-TiO2 composites were an excellent candidate as a PDT photo sensitizer in the near future.

The as-fabricated electrodes are evaluated via SEM, FTIR, EDAX, EIS, CV and charge-discharge tests. The SEM images combined with FTIR spectra show that the surface of the electrode is covered by the PANI nanowires. The charge-discharge tests of PANI5 display the best cyclic performance, delivering the initial discharge capacity of 1304 mAh g(-1), and 725 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at the current density of 320 mAg(-1). The CV results of the PANI-5 present an overlapping of cathodic/anodic peaks, indicating that the suitable mass of PANI coating can increase the reversibility of the electrode. SEM combined with EDAX tests of the electrodes after cycles show that the sulfur species are trapped by the PANI nanowires. These results demonstrate that the PANI covering layer plays a barrier to restrain the dissolution of the polysulfides, and provide spaces as well as conductive media for sulfur species.

Because LPS is an electronic insulator similar to S and Li2S, LPS functions as an active material at an interface between LPS and carbon. In this study, composite electrodes composed of LPS and one of various carbon conductive additives were prepared by ballmilling to investigate electrochemical performances of LPS, electrical effective conductivities, and a contact area between LPS and carbon in the LPS-carbon composite electrodes. The rate performance of all-solid-state cells with LPS-carbon composite electrodes was mainly affected by the ionic effective conductivity and the contact area of the composite electrodes. In various carbons, activated carbon was the most promising carbon to achieve the high electrical effective conductivities and the large contact area in the LPS-carbon composite electrode prepared by ballmilling.

The porosity of the matrix played an important role in enhancing the electrochemical performance of Li/Na-Te batteries. Specifically, the mesopores could accommodate active materials whereas the macropores provided sufficient space for partial Te accommodation and volume expansion in discharge. In addition, N heteroatoms in carbon species could enhance the electrical conductivity and widen its application in lithium/sodium storage. The monolithic and flaky architecture of the nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon sponge/tellurium composite offered a highly conductive network for fast electron transportation. As a result, the nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon sponge/tellurium composite achieved a superior rate performance for Li-Te and Na-Te batteries.

The ZnO templates can be easily removed using HCl(aq), thereby avoiding limitations present in conventional porous silica templating approaches that require highly corrosive HF(aq) for template removal. Notably, the proposed solvent-free synthetic method from low-cost pitch to high-value porous carbons is a friendly process with respect to our overexploited environment. With the combination of ZnO nanoparticles and pitch, the surface area (76-548 m(2) g(-1)) of the resultant mesoporous carbons increases with an increase in the weight ratios of ZnO to pitch. Furthermore, the hierarchical micro/mesoporous carbons with a large surface area (854-1979 m(2) g(-1)) can be feasibly fabricated by only adding an appropriate amount of an activating agent. Meanwhile, N-doped hierarchical porous carbons can be achieved by carbonizing the blend of these materials with melamine. For supercapacitor application, the resultant carbons exhibit a high capacitance up to 200.5 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) using LiClO4/PC as the electrolyte in a symmetrical two-electrode cell. More importantly, the coin-cell supercapacitor based on porous carbons achieved a capacitance of 94 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) and 63% capacitance retention at 500 mV s(-1), thereby holding the potential for commercialization.

As-prepared ultralight Co3O4/MCS possessed mechanically robust characteristic and unique 3D macroporous framework anchored with corrugated Co3O4 dodecahedra. Utilized as a pseudocapacitor electrode, Co3O4/MCS hybrid exhibited a great specific capacitance of 1409.5 F g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1) and excellent long-term cycling stability of 93.2% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles, which might be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the inherent high redox activity from Co3O4 polyhedra combined with excellent electrical conductivity of MCS.

J	Fan, JX; Yang, J; Pham, A; Li, S				Fan, Jiaxin; Yang, Jack; Pham, Anh; Li, Sean			Origins of possible synergistic effects in the interactions between metal atoms and MoS2/graphene heterostructures for battery applications	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							ELECTRON LOCALIZATION; LITHIUM; MOS2; ADSORPTION; GRAPHENE; ANODE	The interactions between metals and two-dimensional materials, in particular, the adsorption energies, strongly determine the performances of rechargeable batteries. Previously, it has been demonstrated that heterostructures of two dimensional (2D) materials can lead to enhanced metal adsorptions, which were ascribed to the existence of 'synergistic' effects amongst metal atoms and two different 2D materials. However, further investigations are still required to reveal the physical mechanisms behind the contribution of these possible 'synergistic' effects for metal intercalations in 2D heterostructures. Here, we selected MoS2/graphene as a prototypical system, and we examined the adsorption and intercalation thermochemistry of monovalent atoms (Li, Na and K) and multivalent atoms (Mg, Ca and Al) using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The synergistic effects arising from charge polarizations in these systems were quantified using the three-body interaction energy terms. Our results show strong system dependencies whereby the interactions between the Mg or Ca atom with the MoS2/graphene heterostructures might exhibit cooperative bindings. Nevertheless, metal adsorptions on top of the graphene surface were all found to be anti-cooperative in this case. Our results suggest that enhancement of metal adsorptions using 2D heterostructures is predominantly driven by increasing dispersion interactions due to increases in the interaction surface areas.

Here we demonstrate that such issues can be effectively addressed by embedding sulfur microparticles into a self-healable and polysulfide-confining binder comprising of trithiocarbonate, carboxylic acid, and amino functionalities. In the charge/discharge process, the binder autonomously integrates the pulverized sulfur particles together via its excellent self-healability and good extendibility, but also effectively confines the generated polysulfides by its polar functionalities. Consequently, the resulting sulfur cathodes deliver high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability, and good cycling stability. This self-healing and confining strategy provides a novel insight into the structural collapse and shuttle effect of sulfur cathodes.

Herein, we load a series of Mo-based compounds (i.e., MoO2, MoS2, MoN and MoP) on mesoporous carbon nanosheets to modify the separator of Li-S batteries, and systematically study the kinetic behaviors of polysulfides on these separators. We demonstrate that the battery using the MoP-modified separator exhibits the best electrochemical performance because of the narrower energy gap between the metal 3d- and anion 2p-band centers than other compounds. Both experiments and calculations confirm that the narrow energy gap can efficiently lower the decomposition barriers of Li2S. Accordingly, the battery with the MoP-modified separator exhibits a high rate and long life. In particular, owing to the improved kinetics, this battery can be cycled at -40 degrees C with a high capacity (391.0 mA h g(-1)) and a promising stability (capacity retention of 89.6% over 100 cycles).

Its performance is strongly restricted by the cathode catalysts, in which carbon-based catalysts have been mostly investigated up to now. However, the impacting factors on the performance of carbon catalysts is not yet elucidated. Here, we employed a variety of carbon materials with different pore-structure features as the cathode catalysts of Li-CO2 batteries to reveal which are the main influencing factor on the catalytic performance of carbon catalysts. It is found that suitable pore shape (most important), large pore size and high surface area are crucial factors to the catalytic performance of carbon catalysts. This finding is of great significance to the further development of Li-CO2 batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Capacitive deionization technology has the advantages of low cost, high efficiency, and no pollution. It is an effective means to treat highly mineralized water in the oil field. This paper establishes a simplified mathematical model based on the Nernst Planck equation, combined with porous media flow theory and Langmuir isotherm theory. The capacitive deionization process of NaCl solution by finite element method is simulated. The results show that the convection mass transfer effect of ions in the activated carbon electrodes is weak. When the initial solution ion concentration is equal, the activated carbon cathode can absorb more Cl-. In the solution with an initial concentration of 1.7 mol/m(3), when the electrode adsorption reaches saturation, the concentration of Cl- is 0.1 mm lower than that of Na+. In the capacitive deionization process using activated carbon electrodes, the desalting efficiency of ions is almost proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the liquid flow rate.

Successful doping of hollow carbon nanofiber with nitrogen and sulfur is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning and tunneling electron microscopy. Further analysis certifies that sulfur doping has a significant impact in improving the elecctrochemical performance of the carbon-based anodes for NIBs. The obtained N-doped hollow carbon nanofiber and N/S co-doped hollow carbon nanofiber exhibit similar morphologies but different electrochemical behavior. As expected, the N/S co-doped hollow carbon nanofiber anode exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity, outstanding long-term stability, and good rate stability.

Three parameters (water-binder ratio, carbon nanotube-to-dispersant ratio (CNT/dispersant ratio), and MWCNT content) were varied, and the compressive strength, flexural strength, and porosity of the composite matrix were determined. The results indicated that in comparison with the reference sample, the compressive and flexural strengths of the composites increased with the addition of 0.045wt% MWCNTs, owing to matrix porosity refinement. The mechanical properties of the composites reached their maximum values when the water-binder ratio was 0.4. Moreover, the dispersant influenced the mechanical properties of the composites. The optimal CNT-dispersant ratio was found to be 2.5:1, and the compressive and flexural strengths of the samples with this ratio increased by 48% and 55%, respectively.

The results indicated that the suitable addition of HBPSi-MWCNTs could largely enhance the tribological properties of BOZ-BMI composites. The worn surface of the composites showed that the severe wear of the BOZ-BMI resin was converted from adhesive wear to abrasive wear with the addition of HBPSi-MWCNTs. The excellent tribological properties can be attributed to the improved interfacial adhesion between HBPSi-MWCNTs and the BOZ-BMI resin matrix. The TGA demonstrated that the composite with 0.8 wt.% HBPSi-MWCNTs exhibits better thermal resistance; thus, it can inhibit adhesive wear during the friction process. The XPS spectra and the surface energy showed that the HBPSi-MWCNTs could be exposed on the worn surface of the composite to improve the anti-wear capacity of the composites further.

The current research lacks a tool and instrument that can extensively account for residents' commuting. Traditional methods are mainly based on questionnaire surveys, which have low accuracy at spatial and temporal aspects. High accuracy carbon emission accounting methods can effectively assist urban planning and achieve precise urban emissions reductions. This study applies a taxi commuting carbon emissions accounting method divided into two main steps. Firstly, the carbon emissions of taxi trajectories are calculated using taxi trajectory data and a carbon emission calculation method developed based on VSP. Secondly, the taxi trajectory and POI data are used to filter the commuter trajectory with the help of a two-step moving search method. In this way, the taxi commuting carbon emissions were obtained. Then, the spatial distribution characteristics of residential taxi commuting carbon emissions are analysed by spatial autocorrelation tools, which could facilitate low carbon zoning management. A typical working day in Hangzhou was selected as the research object of this study. The results show that (1) morning peak commuting carbon emissions in the main urban area of Hangzhou reached 2065.14 kg per hour, accounting for 13.73% of all taxi travel carbon emissions; and evening peak commuting carbon emissions reached 732.2 kg per hour, accounting for 4% of all taxi travel carbon emissions; (2) At the grid level, the spatial distribution of commuting carbon emissions in Hangzhou shows a single central peak that decays in all directions; and (3) The results at the resident community scale show that urban public transport facilities influence resident community commuting carbon emissions. In areas such as at the urban-rural border, resident community commuting carbon emissions show high levels of aggregation, and in the main urban area, resident community commuting carbon emissions show low levels of aggregation. This study not only provides a new method of commuting investigation but also offers constructive suggestions for future carbon emission reduction under Hangzhou's urban planning.

The combination of visual monitoring with the electrical current response during cyclic voltammetry provides valuable insights into the sulfur formation and dissolution mechanism. Our observations show that the crystal growth process is mainly dictated by a rapid equilibrium between long-chain polysulfides on one side and solid sulfur/short-chain polysulfides on the other side, which is consistent with previous studies in this field. The high temporal and spatial resolution of synchrotron imaging enables the observation of different regimes during the sulfur formation and dissolution process. The appearance of short-chain polysulfides after the first anodic CV peak initiates a rapid dissolution process of alpha-sulfur crystals on the cathode. The increase in the long-chain lithium polysulfide concentration at the cathode surface during charge results in an increased crystal growth rate, which in turn produces imperfections in alpha- and beta-sulfur crystals. There are strong indications that these defects are fluid inclusions, which may trap dissolved polysulfides and therefore reduce the electrochemical cell capacity.

We show that, in a full resonant tunneling regime for all beam components, the formation of standing waves can lead sudden phase jumps similar to -pi and giant lateral Goos-Hanchen shifts as large as the transverse beam width, while the interplay of the spin and valley imaginary wave vectors in the modulated regions can lead differences of resonant angles for the four spin-valley flavors, manifesting a spin-valley beam splitting effect. The splitting effect is found to be controllable by the gating and strain. (C) 2016 Author(s).

X-Ray diffraction results showed that I- in AlI3 dissolved into the Li2S structure in (100 - x)Li2S center dot xAlI(3) with x <= 5 to form the solid solution. The change of the electronic structure of Li2S and AlI3 was further proved by UV-Vis spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results. The highest conductivity of about 6.0 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) at room temperature was obtained with 80Li(2)S center dot 20AlI(3) (mol%) and the highest conductivity at 150 degrees C of about 7.0 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) was observed in 75Li(2)S center dot 25AlI(3). The maximum capacities of the cells with x = 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 2 were 880, 1059, 1006, and 869 mA h g(-1) Li2S, respectively. The capacity retention of the cells with x = 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 2 after 60 cycles was 64.0%, 88.4%, 69.6%, and 71.2%, respectively. This study showed that AlI3 doping could improve not only the conductivities of Li2S but also the cyclic properties of all-solid-state Li-S batteries.

We report the first example in which 1,3-dioxolane was used to produce dispersions of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to modify glassy carbon electrodes (GCE). The films of MWCNTs obtained after evaporation were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and adsorptive stripping voltammetry (ASV). 1,3-Dioxolane, a green solvent that is nontoxic, odourless and environmentally friendly, produces nanotube dispersions that leaves no residue on the resulting electrode when it evaporates.

In this study, SnSe2 nanoparticles chemically embedded in a carbon shell (SnSe2@C) were fabricated from Sn-organic frameworks and evaluated as an anode material for SIBs. The structural characterization demonstrated that there existed C-Sn chemical bonds between the SnSe2 nanoparticles and carbon shell, which could strongly anchor SnSe2 nanoparticles to the carbon shell. Such a structure can not only facilitate charge transfer but also ensure the structural stability of the SnSe2@C electrode. In addition, the carbon shell also helped in the dispersion of SnSe2 nanoparticles, thus offering more redox-active sites for Na+ storage. The as-prepared SnSe2@C nanocomposite could deliver good cycling stability and a superior rate capability of 324 mA h g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) for SIBs.

The rmcrostructure and cracking susceptibility of the laser-clad layers, were studied in terms of carbon additions. Results show that the small change of the carbon content in the alloy powders can obviously change the microstructure and properties of the layers. When the carbon content is in the range of 0.3-0.4 wt.%. the decrease of the carbon content in alloy powders will increase the hardness and toughness of the layers simultaneously under the same process parameters. As a result, crack-free coatings with high hardness can be obtained. As the carbon content increases from 0.2 wt.%, to 0.4 wt.%, the segregation ratio of chromium increases, while the segregation ratios of nickel. manganese. and silicon first decrease and then increase. At the same time, a new designing principle concerning the composition and microstructure has been put forward, and the principal mechanisms of strengthening and toughening of the layers are fine-grain strengthening and low carbon martensitic phase transformation strengthening (C) 2004 Elsevier BX All rights reserved.

Herein, the novel boron-doped graphene aerogel (BGA) modified gas diffusion electrode (GDEs) was prepared, characterized, and employed for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation in nonmetallic EAOPs. Boron doping could promote electrode property with a complete BPA removal within 60 min, which was attributed to the enhancement of H2O2 in-situ decomposition to center dot OH. An appropriate proportion of BGA (2.4%) represented more positive onset potential, favoring the remarkable improvement of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The metal-free EAOPs on BGA-GDEs manifested smaller change in reaction rate (0.0952 min(-1)) compared with that of traditional Electro-Fenton (EF) process (0.19115 min(-1)) when the initial pH increased from 3.0 to 9.0, revealing that the catalytic activity of this metal-free system exhibited excellent stability over a wide pH range. In addition, the overwhelming superiority of stability was certified. Hence, the in-situ metal-free electrocatalysis on BGA-GDEs could be considered as an environment-friendly pollutant removal system without risk of metal contamination.

Fully carbon metasurface: Absorbing coating in microwaves	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							VITREOUS CARBON; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; COMPOSITE MEDIUM; FERRITE; ARRAYS; MODEL	The microwave-absorbing properties of a heterostructure consisting of an ordered monolayer of porous glassy carbon spheres were experimentally and theoretically investigated in the Ka-band (26-37GHz) frequency range. The electromagnetic response of such a "moth-eye"-like all-carbon metasurface at a normal incidence angle was modelled on the basis of long-wave approximation. Modelling parameters in the Ka-band were used to estimate and predict the absorption properties of monolayers in free space in the range 1-40 GHz. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that a metasurface based on porous glassy carbon spheres is an inert, lightweight, compact, and perfectly absorbing material for designing new effective microwave absorbers in various practically used frequency ranges.

The results indicated that PMS could be activated at carbon cloth anode during electrolysis, resulting in the improvement of SMX degradation. The degradation efficiency of SMX was facilitated with the higher PMS concentration and current density, respectively. The degradation rate constant of SMX increased with the rising pH from 3.6 to 6.0, and reached the highest value at pH 6.0, and then decreased with further increasing pH to 8.0. The presence of chloride ion (Cl-, 5-100 mM) significantly enhanced SMX degradation, while addition of humic acid (HA, 1-5 mgC L-1) inhibited SMX degradation. Addition of carbonate (HCO3, 5-20 mM) had a negligible impact on SMX degradation. Small amounts of phosphate (PO43-, 0-5 mM) could promote degradation, while a large amount of PO43- (10-20 mM) inhibited the degradation. Moreover, the quenching experiments demonstrated that sulfate radical (SO4), hydroxyl radical (OH) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) contributed to SMX degradation in E (Carbon cloth Anode)/PMS system. The degradation intermediates of SMX were identified by LC-MS/MS and the degradation pathways were deduced to be hydroxylation, the cleavage of S-N bond, and oxidation of aniline group. Moreover, the micronucleus test of Vicia faba root tips indicated that the E (Carbon Cloth Anode)/PMS system could reduce the genetic toxicity of SMX contaminated water to some extent.

Herein, an eco-friendly biomass carbonization strategy is utilized to synthesize porous carbon nano-honeycombs (CNs) with hierarchical microstructures. Inspiringly, graphitic domains in the CNs can endow conductivity way for electron/charge transport, simultaneously, disordered domains with dilated lattice spacing (0.4 nm) are beneficial for Na+ storage. Both of the merits synergically make the CNs boost superior sodium storage performance with high reversible capacity (322 mAh g(-1) at 50 mA g(-1)), superb rate capability (91 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1)), and cycling stability (99.8% retention over 10,0 0 0 cycles at 2.5 A g(-1)). Moreover, the CNs-based sodium-ion capacitor (SIC) device achieves high energy/power densities (122 Wh kg(-1) at 112.5 W kg(-1) and 17,619 W kg(-1) at 34.6 Wh kg(-1)) with an outstanding cycle stability (95.7% retention over 10,0 0 0 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1)).

The hollow metal-polydopamine (PDA) particles are formed by a coordination assembly of metal ions (Co and Zn) and PDA, inheriting the morphology of MOF (ZIF-67 and ZIF-8) crystals. The hollow porous metal/ N-carbon particles morphosynthetically transformed from hollow metal-PDA particles exhibit excellent oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity. The strategy presented here is promising for synthesizing hollow metal-organic polymer (metal-carbon) particles with diverse morphologies for energy and environmental applications.

For the construction of the H2O2 sensor, polyaniline (PANI) is first electrodeposited on the surface of graphene (G) to form PANI/G, and then horseradish peroxidase (HRP) loaded on AgNPs (HRP/AgNPs) is immobilized on to the PANI/G. H2O2 can be catalyzed by HRP to generate current response which can be significantly enhanced by AgNPs, and thus the PANI/G based sensor can be utilized for the detection of H2O2. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed H2O2 sensor exhibits wide linear response to H2O2 concentration ranging from 0.25 to 2.25 mM with a detection limit of 0.03 mM (signal-to-noise ratio of 3), and it also shows high selectivity and reproducibility. The method is simple and cost-effective, and can be a promising candidate as the sensitive sensing platform for H2O2. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2015, 132, 42409.

Sulfur/CuxS hybrid material for Li/S primary battery with improved discharge capacity	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						Sulfur/CuxS; Hybrid material; Primary lithium batteries	CATHODE MATERIAL; COPPER SULFIDE; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; CARBON; DIFFUSION; OXIDE; CUS	Sulfur is potential for primary lithium battery with high power and energy. However, the discharge capacity is limited due to the low electrochemical activity of sulfur. In this work, CuxS is incorporated into sulfur cathode synergistically to improve discharge specific capacity for primary lithium battery. For the sulfur/CuxS hybrid cathodes, discharge capacity is higher than the sulfur cathode. With the CuxS in hybrid cathodes varying from 40% to 60 wt %, the discharge capacity increases and then decreases when CuxS reaches 80 wt %. An enhanced discharge capacity of 1618.5 mAh g((s))(-1) at the current rate of 0.1C, energy density of 1107 Wh kg((CuS+S))(-1) and power density of 2827 W kg((CuS+S))(-1) are obtained when CuxS reaches 60 wt %. The good discharge performance is derived from trapping of polysusfides through chemical redox of sulfiphilic CuxS and capacity contribution of semi conductive CuxS. And, the self discharge is limited of the sulfur/CuxS hybrid cathodes. This new cooperation provides a promising approach to significantly enhance the discharge performance of primary lithium batteries.	[Cheng, J.

The detailed kinetic and thermodynamic behaviors of the entire ORR process on sulfur doped monovacancy graphene (SGV), as well as the original mechanism are investigated by the dispersion-corrected density function theory (DFT-D) calculations. It is found that the SGV is rather stable and the sulfur dopant is probably the active center. There are two proposed ORR pathways by kinetic process: the dissociation of OOH and the hydrogenation of OOH with the ratedetermining steps of 0.75 eV and 0.62 eV, respectively. And the Gibbs free energy diagram of the entire ORR indicates that the dissociation of OOH is precluded, because the process of reduction step of O into OH is endothermic, while the hydrogenation of HOOH is the most favorable pathway even at high potential of 0.86 V. Our DFT-D simulation suggests that the SGV would be an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR.

Lake Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv is a large and shallow eutrophic lake where water quality measurements have been carried out for a long time. The monthly characteristics of DOC and CDOM in Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv and its input/output rivers were traced in 5-years observations. We attempted to link the hydro-morphological indices as lake area (A), water level (WL) and volume variations (Qc) with lake DOC fluxes and CDOM-DOC relationships to improve understanding of carbon fluxes in a very shallow, large and highly eutrophic lake, as well as of the possibility to estimate DOC fluxes by CDOM via remote sensing. The research questions were: how the properties and quantity of DOC, its fluxes and CDOM-DOC relationship in a very shallow, large and highly eutrophic lake are responding to 1) variable proportions of allochthonous and autochthonous processes and 2) changing hydrological conditions. The increased lake volume variation in spring caused the higher level of CDOM, signifying the terrestrial (allochthonous) DOC (DOCAlloch) domination in Lake Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv. The proportion of DOCAlloch increased together with increasing WL, A and CDOM concentration. Although the generally high proportion of DOCAlloch in Vo similar to rtsja center dot rv, the autochthonous DOC determines the water color (CDOM/DOC) in this highly productive ecosystem with short residence time (280-365 days). Our study on DOC flux revealed that the internal carbon sources, driven by hydrological factors, contribute significantly to the role of large and shallow lakes in global carbon cycling. The further development of water color remote sensing could provide novel directions for understanding the feedbacks of lake DOC flux and changing hydrology.

This study identified the spatial differentiation of influencing factors of agricultural carbon productivity at the city level in Taihu lake basin, and formed differentiated agricultural management strategies. The results show that: (1) Spatial differentiation of agricultural carbon productivity is obvious at city level. It can be divided into three echelons: the first echelon is Shanghai and Hangzhou (agricultural carbon productivity>_10,000 Yuan/t in 2019 with a growth rate >_ 600% compared with 1992), the second echelon is Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou (9000 Yuan/t <_ agricultural carbon productivity<10,000 Yuan/t in 2019 with 381% <_ growth rate < 600% compared with 1992), and the third echelon is Zhenjiang, Huzhou and Jiaxing (agricultural carbon productivity<9000 Yuan/t in 2019 or a growth rate < 381% compared with 1992). (2) There is a synergetic evolution law between agricultural carbon productivity and agricultural economy, that is, agricultural economic development level is the first factor affecting agricultural carbon productivity, whether in the whole basin or in the city level. (3) There are significant differences in the influencing factors of agricultural carbon productivity at the city level. Finally, according to the spatial differentiation characteristics of influencing factors of agricultural carbon productivity at the city level in Taihu lake basin, we put forward different emphases of agricultural development in different cities.

Nevertheless, the growth of dendritic or mossy Li, the crush of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer and the successive reactions between the fresh Li metal and electrolytes hinder the commercialization of Li metal anode. In this paper, we utilize an environmental-friendly and low-cost one-step facile vacuum distillation approach to fabricate the 3D porous Cu current collector from commercial brass foil (Cu-Zn alloy) for Li metal anodes. The continuous porous 3D Cu skeleton is obtained after the vacuum distillated the low boiling point Zn (907 degrees C) component. The voids of the 3D porous copper can be easily regulated by adjusting the distillation temperature and time. As a current collector, the as-prepared 3D porous copper can inhibit the growth of Li dendrite and mitigate the huge volume change of Li metal anode during cycling process, resulting in stable SEI layer and electrode structure. As a result, the 3D porous Cu current collector can achieve a steady Coulumbic efficiency after 120 cycles at 0.52 mA cm(-2) and for more than 80 cycles at 1.04 mA cm(-2) with much reduced polarization. A long lifespan of 800 h is attained in the symmetric Li|Li@Cu battery, and it also indicates the potential for practical application when the Li@Cu|Li(NiCoMn)O-2 full battery is built. More promisingly, such a vacuum distillation method is plain and simple to be combined with current commercial technique of Li metal anode manufacture using a Cu current collector, exhibiting great potentials to accelerate the commercialization lithium metal based (such as Lithium-sulfur and Lithium-air) batteries and the development of high-energy lithium-ion batteries.

The significant advantage of such 2D materials is that nearly all their surfaces are exposed to the electrolyte and can take part in the electrochemical reaction. Here, a versatile active-salt-templating strategy to efficiently synthesize 2D porous carbon nanosheets from layered organic-inorganic hybrids is presented. The resulting heteroatom-doped carbon nanosheets (NFe/CNs) exhibit exceptional performance for the oxygen-reduction reaction and in Zn-air battery electrodes. The activity of the best catalyst within a series of NFe/CNs exceeds the performance of conventional carbon-supported Pt catalysts in terms of onset potential (0.930 vs 0.915 V of Pt/C), half-wave potential (0.859 vs 0.816 V of Pt/C), long-time stability, and methanol tolerance. Also, when applied as a cathode catalyst in a zinc-air battery the NFe/CNs presented here outperform commercial Pt/C catalysts.

These CoNOC-T-c-t porous carbon nanostructures have demonstrated prominent catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium. Compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst, the CoNOC-800-1 (annealed at 800 degrees C for 1 h) exhibits excellent selectivity via an efficient four-electron-dominant ORR process, as well as the superior durability and methanol tolerance, making it a cost-effective Pt-free ORR electrocatalyst. More importantly, the novelly designed N-Co-O catalytic active sites are proposed and well demonstrated by experiments, which provides a promising approach to develop heteroatom-doped carbon-based electrocatalytic materials.

This research reports micro-Raman measurements on the in-plane E-2g optical phonon peaks (similar to 1580 cm-1 in graphene layers and similar to 1362 cm(-1) in h-BN layers) as a function of temperature from -194 to 200 degrees C. The h-BN flakes show higher sensitivity to temperature-dependent frequency shifts and broadenings than graphene flakes. Moreover, the thermal effect in the c direction on phonon frequency in h-BN layers is more sensitive than that in graphene layers but on phonon broadening in h-BN layers is similar as that in graphene layers. These results are very useful to understand the thermal properties and related physical mechanisms in h-BN and graphene flakes for applications of thermal devices.

FB1 is the most predominant among fumonisins and is responsible for severe food contamination that may have deleterious effects on public health. Therefore, the demand for achieving sensitive detection of FB1 is becoming more and more pressing. In the present study, a creative biosensor for FB1 detection was developed based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer between upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and graphene oxide (GO) with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) target recycling and amplification. In the presence of FB1, UCNPs were bound to the CHA amplification products away from the GO surface. Simultaneously, a strong fluorescence signal was produced at 980 nm (near-infrared light). The correlation between the concentration of FB1 and the fluorescence intensity exhibited a high relevance (R2 = 0.9971) ranging from 0.032 to 500 ng mL-1, and the method reached a considerably low limit of detection (0.0121 ng mL-1). It could be applied for the detection of FB1 in corn, oats, and infant supplements. The sensitive detection of FB1 proves the application potential of this method on food safety	[Qin, Yingkai; Li, Shuang; Wang, Yu; Peng, Yuan; Han, Dianpeng; Zhou, Huanying; Bai, Jialei; Ren, Shuyue; Li, Sen; Chen, Ruipeng; Han, Tie; Gao, Zhixian] Tianjin Inst Environm & Operat Med, Tianjin Key Lab Risk Assessment & Control Technol, 1 Li Rd, Tianjin 300050, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuang] Tianjin Univ, Acad Med Engn & Translat Med, 92 Weijin Rd, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China		Han, T; Gao, ZX (corresponding author), Tianjin Inst Environm & Operat Med, Tianjin Key Lab Risk Assessment & Control Technol, 1 Li Rd, Tianjin 300050, Peoples R China.	hantietj@163.com; gaozhx@163.com		Li, Shuang/0000-0002-3970-1061	National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1603500]	National Key Research and Development Program of China	Acknowledgment This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [No. 2018YFC1603500] for funding this research project.		55	0	0	12	12	ELSEVIER	AMSTERDAM	RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0003-2670	1873-4324		ANAL CHIM ACTA	Anal.

Several studies have been reported on structure-chemical composition-ionic conductivity property in Li-stuffed garnet-type metal oxides. Here, an overview of the chemical and electrochemical stability of lithium-based garnets against moisture/humidity, aqueous solutions, carbon dioxide, sulfur, and metallic lithium are analyzed. Moisture and aqueous stability studies focus on understanding the crystal structure stability, the proton exchange capacity as a function of Li content in Li-stuffed garnets, and how the protonated species affect the crystal structure and mass transport properties. H+/Li+ exchange was found to be in the range of 2-100%. Stability concerning Li-ion conductivity and morphology under carbon dioxide are discussed. Interfacial chemical stability with lithium metal characterized by electrochemical stability window, Li dendrite formation and area specific resistance (ASR) for the reaction Li reversible arrow Li+ + e(-) are presented. Recent attempts to suppress dendrite formation and to reduce ASR via surface modification are also highlighted.

However, the defective biocompatibility was also recognized, which restricted their potential applications as biomaterials. In this study, a facile biomimetic approach for preparation of biopolymer adhered GO (rGO) with controllable 2D morphology and excellent biocompatibility was proposed. Mussel-inspired adhesive molecule dopamine (DA) was grafted onto heparin backbone to obtain DA grafted heparin (DA-g-Hep) by carbodiimide chemistry method; then, DA-g-Hep was used to prepare heparin-adhered GO (Hep-a-GO) and heparin-adhered rGO (Hep-a-rGO). The obtained heparin-adhered GO (rGO) showed controllable 2D morphology, ultrastable property in aqueous solution, and high drug and dye loading capacity. Furthermore. the biocompatibility of the heparin-adhered GO (rGO) was investigated using human blood cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which indicated that the as-prepared heparin-adhered GO (rGO) exhibited ultralow hemolysis ratio (lower than 1.2%) and high cell viability. Moreover, the highly anticoagulant bioactivity indicated that the adhered heparin could maintain its biological activity after immobilization onto the surface of GO (rGO). The excellent biocompatibility and high bioactivity of the heparin-adhered GO (rGO) might confer its great potentials for various biomedical applications.

Role of atomic terraces and steps in the electron transport properties of epitaxial graphene grown on SiC	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							GRAPHITE; LAYERS; GAS	Thermal decomposition of vicinal SiC substrates with self-organized periodic nanofacets is a promising method to produce large graphene sheets toward the commercial exploitation of graphene's superior electronic properties. The epitaxial graphene films grown on vicinal SiC comprise two distinct regions of terrace and step; and typically exhibit anisotropic electron transport behavior, although limited areas in the graphene film showed ballistic transport. To evaluate the role of terraces and steps in electron transport properties, we compared graphene samples with terrace and step regions grown on 4H-SiC(0001). Arrays of field effect transistors were fabricated on comparable graphene samples with their channels parallel or perpendicular to the nanofacets to identify the source of measured reduced mobility. Minimum conductivity and electron mobility increased with the larger proportional terrace region area; therefore, the terrace region has superior transport properties to step regions. The measured electron mobility in the terrace region, similar to 1000 cm(2)/Vs, is 10 times larger than that in the step region, similar to 100 cm(2)/Vs. We conclusively determine that parasitic effects originate in regions of graphene that grow over step edges in 4H-SiC(0001). Copyright 2012 Author(s).

In this paper, an easy and highly sensitive screening method using graphene oxide-functionalized magnetic composites (GO@NH2@Fe3O4) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was established for twelve quinolone antibiotics. GO@NH2@Fe3O4 composites were utilized as adsorbents for magnetic solid-phase extraction. This method combines the advantages of magnetic solid-phase extraction and MALDI-TOF MS, which allows for fast detection of quinolones at low concentrations. To improve absorption efficiency, the following parameters were individually optimized: sample acidity, extraction time, amount of adsorbent used, eluent used, and desorption time. Under the optimum conditions, the established method gave a low detection limit of 0.010 mg/L and allowed the high-throughput screening of twelve quinolone antibiotics (enoxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, fleroxacin, gatifloxacin, enrofloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, danofloxacin, difloxacin, and lomefloxacin). The proposed method, having an easily prepared sorbent with a high affinity for quinolones and a convenient, high-throughput detection step, has been shown to have merit for the detection of antibiotics in water samples	[Tang, Hong-zhi; Wang, Yong-hui; Li, Shuang; Wu, Jin; Li, Jun-wen; Zhou, Huan-ying; Gao, Zhi-xian] Tianjin Inst Environm & Operat Med, Tianjin Key Lab Risk Assessment & Control Technol, 1 DaLi Rd, Tianjin 300050, Peoples R China		Zhou, HY; Gao, ZX (corresponding author), Tianjin Inst Environm & Operat Med, Tianjin Key Lab Risk Assessment & Control Technol, 1 DaLi Rd, Tianjin 300050, Peoples R China.	zhouhytj@163.com; gaozhx@163.com			the National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFF0211301] Funding Source: Medline; the Tianjin Scientific and Technology Support Program Funding Agency [16YFZCNC00730] Funding Source: Medline	the National Key R&D Program of China; the Tianjin Scientific and Technology Support Program Funding Agency			41	15	15	10	97	SPRINGER HEIDELBERG	HEIDELBERG	TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY	1618-2642	1618-2650		ANAL BIOANAL CHEM	Anal.

Facile Synthesis and Very Stable Cycling of Polyvinylidene Dichloride Derived Carbon: Sulfur Composite Cathode	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SOLID-ELECTROLYTE INTERPHASE; IONIC-LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; MICROPOROUS CARBON; FLUOROETHYLENE CARBONATE; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; BATTERIES; MOLECULES; MECHANISM	Activated microporous carbon with narrow pores up to 1 nm, high surface area of about 1000 m(2)/g and pore volume of 0.43 cc/g was synthesized by facile one-step carbonization of polyvinylidene dichloride (PVDC) resin at high temperature without any additional activation process and was used for the preparation of sulfur-carbon (S/C) composite electrodes with sulfur content of 40 wt% in the composite S/C powder and 32 wt% in the composite electrode. The electrodes thus obtained, demonstrate a very stable cycling performance with more than 2000 charge-discharge cycles delivering about 600 mAh/g at a current rate of 1.04 A/g with Coulombic efficiency close to 100% at 30 degrees C. Stable and highly reversible behavior was also obtained at 45 degrees C for hundreds of cycles. Quasi-solid state type of behavior with single reduction plateau was observed for these Li-S cells using organic carbonates based electrolyte solutions. The formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the surface of the cycled S/C electrodes was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For the composite sulfur electrodes prepared with PVDC-derived carbon the shuttle phenomena are fully avoided due to appropriate encapsulation, surface protection and quasi-solid state operation mechanism.

In this paper, MOF materials were synthesized by the solvent method, and MOF-derived nitrogen self-doped porous carbon materials were prepared by a one-step carbonization method. The effects of carbonization temperature and time on the structure and electrochemical properties of MOF-derived nitrogen self-doped porous carbon materials were investigated. The results show that MOF-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon has an amorphous graphite carbon structure with a large specific surface area and various pore structures. In a 6 M KOH electrolyte solution, when the current density was 1 A g(-1), the MOF-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon material exhibited a specific capacitance of 219.4 F g(-1); after 5000 cycles of constant current charging and discharging, the capacitance retention rate was still 88.94%, showing excellent electrochemical performance and good cycling stability.

It is therefore highly demanded to develop an effective strategy to fabricate mechanically strong hydrogels. Herein, a kind of bioinspired ternary hydrogel consisting of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, xonotlite nanowires, and polyacrylamide (PAM) is constructed under the synergy of hydrogen bonding-induced GO/xonotlite network and the penetrated PAM chain network. Benefiting from the effective energy dissipation mechanism caused by double-network structural design and the strong hydrogen bonding interaction between two nanobuilding blocks, the gel exhibits a high toughness of 22 MJ m(-3) at an elongation of 2750%. Even notched with 1/4 size, it still holds a large extensibility of 2180% its initial length.

A three-dimensional surface modified carbon cloth designed as flexible current collector for high-performance lithium and sodium batteries	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Surface modified carbon fibers; Li4Ti5O12; Lithium batteries; Sodium batteries	REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; LIFE ANODE MATERIALS; ION BATTERY; LI4TI5O12 ANODE; ELECTRODE; NANOPARTICLES; NANOFIBER; ARRAYS	Flexible batteries as one of the most promising technologies for the application of wearable and soft electronic devices have attracted great attention in recent years. Similar to conventional secondary batteries, cyclability, and high rate capacities are also required for application of flexible electronics. In this paper, a flexible surface modified carbon cloth architecture is designed as a current collector and prepared for the application in Li and Na batteries. Owing to the design of rough structure on carbon fibers, the surface area for active materials to nucleate and grow can be increased, and the rough surface ensures a good contact between the active material and carbon fibers. The binder free Li4Ti5O12/surface modified carbon cloth electrodes exhibit excellent cycle ability for both Li and Na storages. The electrode delivers a small capacity loss of 9.5% after 6000 cycles at 10C with a capacity retention of 131 mA h g(-1) for Li storage. And a capacity of 124 mA h g(-1) is obtained after 1000 cycles for Na storage. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Yang, L.

However, their limited lifespan caused by uncontrollable Li deposition and dendrite growth impedes the commercial application of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that sulfur-nitrogen co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (SNC) can serve as perfect Li plating scaffolds for a dendrite-free lithium metal anode (LMA). Through first principles calculation, it is found that the higher Li-s and S-p/N-p orbital hybridization degree results in a stronger adsorption ability of Li atoms, which suggests a synergistic effect of S, N co-doping. We demonstrate that SNC and Li have strong binding energy and short bond length, which are beneficial for the uniform growth of Li and dendrite inhibition. When applied as the anode for Li metal batteries, the SNC based LMA exhibits high cycling stability and excellent rate capability in a half cell. A full cell with the cathode LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 exhibits a capacity retention of 86% after 160 cycles, much better than that with a Li foil anode (73%). This work may shed light on the design of advanced LMAs by employing heteroatom doped functionalized carbon scaffolds.

Sensitive room-temperature terahertz detection via the photothermoelectric effect in graphene	NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							GENERATION	Terahertz radiation has uses in applications ranging from security to medicine(1). However, sensitive room-temperature detection of terahertz radiation is notoriously difficult(2). The hot-electron photothermoelectric effect in graphene is a promising detection mechanism; photoexcited carriers rapidly thermalize due to strong electron-electron interactions(3,4), but lose energy to the lattice more slowly(3,5). The electron temperature gradient drives electron diffusion, and asymmetry due to local gating(6,7) or dissimilar contact metals(8) produces a net current via the thermoelectric effect. Here, we demonstrate a graphene thermoelectric terahertz photodetector with sensitivity exceeding 10 V W-1 (700 V W-1) at room temperature and noise-equivalent power less than 1,100 pW Hz(-1/2) (20 pW Hz(-1/2)), referenced to the incident (absorbed) power. This implies a performance that is competitive with the best room-temperature terahertz detectors(9) for an optimally coupled device, and time-resolved measurements indicate that our graphene detector is eight to nine orders of magnitude faster than those(7,10). A simple model of the response, including contact asymmetries (resistance, work function and Fermi-energy pinning) reproduces the qualitative features of the data, and indicates that orders-of-magnitude sensitivity improvements are possible.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						East Asia; Carbon emissions; Carbon abatement	CHINA; UNCERTAINTIES; TRENDS	Although most countries have submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), there is a lack of understanding what policies are effective in terms of carbon emission reduction under the announced pledges. We use East Asia as a case study to estimate the importance of national environmental policies in terms of reduction in fossil fuel carbon emissions (FFCO2). We show that the flagship policies of China, Japan, South Korea and Mongolia in the 2010s were generally beneficial in terms of slowing down FFCO2 growth rates. When flagship polices were enacted, annual FFCO2 growth rate has either slowed down by 1% (South Korea), 5% (Mongolia), 8% (China) or even resulted in a decline (Japan) comparing to prior periods. We find that the 12th Five-Year Plan (12th FYP) of China had the strongest footprint in FFCO2 emission dynamics across East Asia in 2010s. The recent slowest rate of FFCO2 growth across East Asia (2011-2015) temporally corresponds to the 12th FYP. This regional pattern of FFCO2 dynamics is driven by decrements in annual growth of FFCO2, coal use and cement production of China (all (-)8% per yer decrease) during the 12th FYP. Using compound periodical growth of FFCO2 emissions, we provide two baseline projections of emission distribution in East Asia, by assuming that all policies are enacted (policy-on) or not (policy-off) in the future. The projections show that policies were beneficial since policy-on scenario results in 24%, 80%, 166% less FFCO2 emissions than in policy off scenario in East Asia by 2020, 2025 and 2030 respectively. This progress is yet insufficient for reaching NDC goals by 2030. Even in policy-on scenario in 2030, East Asian countries would either experience insufficient decline of FFCO2 like Japan (-13% of FFCO2 comparing to pledged-17%) or increase of FFCO2 like South Korea (11%) and Mongolia (4%) comparing to 2010 level. For China, due to lack of economy-independent goals, we were unable to assess NDC target compliance. We demonstrate that China will remain as the major FFCO2 emitter of EA in near future in any projection. For China, the highest emission cluster will remain at the Eastern Provinces with the strongest power generation demand. These provinces would be responsible for 43% and 52% of FFCO2 emissions in East Asia in policy-off and policy-on scenarios. We concluded that the current efforts of national flagship environmental policies are beneficial but not sufficient for reaching ambitious carbon reduction goals like Paris Agreement. This study once again underlined the necessity in the supranational framework that may control the carbon abatement goals in East Asia. Without the supranational framework, achievements in carbon emission reductions are strongly hindered by the socioeconomic environment and the regional (or sectoral) emphasis of carbon reduction activities within a national economy.

The effects of glucose concentration and reaction time on the size and morphology of CMSs were studied. CMSs with surface area of 642.5 m(2)/g and pore size of 0.8 nm were exploited to design hybrid material of CMSs with Ag decoration by radio frequency plasma (RF plasma). A series of investigations using X-ray diffraction, UV-vis spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy was carried out to characterize the Ag decorated CMSs. RF plasma was employed to reduce Ag+ ions to metallic nano-particles with the particle size of 10-20 nm and form a clean metal-support (Ag-CMSs) interface.

During the room temperature impact consolidation (RTIC), the OLC nanoparticles (5-10 nm) experienced remarkable deformation along both the perpendicular and parallel directions to the coating-substrate interface. Particle deformation, mechanical interlocking, and van der Waals forces between the OLC particles were revealed as the major regimes for coating formation. The aerosol deposition technique might open new avenues for fabricating carbonaceous nanostructures for various functional applications.

The hierarchical composite employs the nitrogen-enriched carbon hollow sphere as an interior shell and intercrossed Ni/Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets as an exterior shell. The obtained N-C@LDH hollow microspheres (HMS) have high nitrogen enrichment, large specific surface area (337 m(2) g(-1)), and uniform and open mesoporous structure. Taking advantage of these characteristics, the composite exhibits obviously superior capacitive behavior, including high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability, compared with nitrogen-free carbon@LDH composite and hollow LDH without carbon shell. The composite displays high specific capacitance of 1711.51 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). In particular, the high specific capacitance can be kept to 997.3 F g(-1) at a high current density of 10 A g(-1), which still retains 94.97% of the initial specific capacitance after 500 cycles at this high current density. This N-enriched, hollow carbon/LDH composite can be expected to be a promising electrode material for electrochemical capacitors due to its high electrochemical performance.

The S-coated-MWCNTs were obtained by ball-milling and thermal treatment. The polymerization was carried out by adding 2.6 g of dispersed S/MWCNT and 0.65 g of aniline hydrochloride to ethanol, and then mixing in a certain amount of ammonium peroxydisulfate dissolved in 0.2 M HCl. The addition of S/MWCNT reduced the polymerization time from 60 to 21 min. The composites were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, and electrochemical methods. A 70.0% sulfur, 20.2% emeraldine PANi salt and 9.8% MWCNT composite gave the typical two reduction peaks and two oxidation peaks; these are due to three polysulfide species. The initial discharge capacity was 1334.4 mAh g(-1)-S for the PANi-S/MWCNT electrode and the remaining capacity was 932.4 mAh g(-1)-S after 80 cycles. The columbic efficiency doubled to 92.4% compared to S-MWCNT-2. The rate of the reaction upon using PANi-S/MWCNT electrode was found to be almost twice that of the S/MWCNT composites. Because of the porous polymer, the diffusion distance of the lithium ion from the bulk liquid was reduced. The gel-like cathode composites and the higher conductivities improved the kinetics of the lithium sulfur redox reaction.

J	Li, S; Wang, CA				Li, Sa; Wang, Chang-An			Design and synthesis of hierarchically porous MnO2/carbon hybrids for high performance electrochemical capacitors	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Manganese dioxide; Carbon spheres; Inward-outward growth model; Super capacitor	MANGANESE OXIDE; HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS; HIGH-POWER; MNO2; SUPERCAPACITOR; NANOCOMPOSITE; COMPOSITES	In this study, various morphologies of manganese dioxide (MnO2), including solid spheres, yolk-shell structures, and hollow spheres, are synthesized through an ambient reaction between KMnO4 and carbon sphere. The diversity in crystal structure and morphology of these forms of MnO2 are investigated using detailed X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observations, and a possible formation mechanism called "inward-outward growth" is proposed. Based on our experimental results, we believe that the final products form through a synergetic effect of outward diffusing carbonaceous fragments and inward diffusing aqueous KMnO4 solution. The rate of inward KMnO4 diffusion relative to the rate of outward carbon diffusion determines the morphology of the MnO2 product. Furthermore, a coated core structure consisting of an internal graphitized carbon sphere and an external MnO2 layer is successfully synthesized, which not only possesses high surface area and hierarchical porosity, but also has improved electrical conductivity. Such structural characteristics enable the obtained composite to show a specific capacitance of 583 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) polyhedrons are first in situ grown on the fibrils of commercial melamine foam at room temperature, and then phosphided and carbonized to obtain the free-standing 3D hierarchical CoP@N-doped carbon composite foam (CoP@NC/CF) with interconnected architecture. The 3D interconnected carbon networks provide efficient and fast channels for the rapid transfer of ions and electrons, and inhibit the agglomeration of CoP nanoparticles. The unique structure of CoP@NC/CF thus allows for delivering the remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 151.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 64.8 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term stability. This research provides a new strategy for the rational design and facile synthesis of the free-standing 3D CoP-based catalysts for high-performance HER.

The effects of carbon content on microstructure and mechanical properties of TiAl alloys were investigated by microstructure observation, tensile test at room temperature and creep properties measurement. The results show that the preferred orientation lamellar microstructure can still be obtained after adding 0.05%similar to 0.2% C. The volume fraction of the alpha(2) lamellae increases slightly and the lamellar spacing tends to refine with the increase of C content, and the relationship between the lamellar spacing and yield strength is in accordance with the Hall-Petch relationship. When the carbon content exceeds 0.1%, fine Ti2AlC-type carbides precipitate inside the alpha(2) and gamma lamellae and at the lamellar interfaces as well, and the size and quantity of the carbides increase with the increase of carbon content. The ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of the alloy at room temperature are improved by adding 0.05%similar to 0.2% C, and the improvement gradually increases with the increase of C content. The tensile strength and yield strength are increased by 101 MPa and 123 MPa, respectively, when the carbon content is 0.2%. The creep resistance has been improved significantly by adding carbon. When the carbon content is 0.1%, the creep performance is the best. Compared with that of the alloy without carbon addition, the plastic creep strain is reduced by half, and the creep rate at the same strain is reduced by more than one order of magnitude. The addition of C element can restrain the generation and multiplication of dislocations at the initial stage of creep. In the primary creep stage, the formation of jogs and debris in the gamma lamellae hinder the movement of dislocation which contribute to the remarkable increase in strain hardening effect of the C-containing alloy. At the same time, the Ti2AlC-type carbides further strengthen the lamellar interfaces and the matrix, and the refinement of the lamellar spacing together improves the gliding resistance of dislocation across the lamellar interface.

However, pure OMCs have low specific capacitance due to its simplex storage mechanism based on electric double layer. In this work, anthraquinone (AQ) is used as a modifier to boost the capacitance of OMCs. The modified materials (AQ/OMCs) can not only provide mesoporous channels facilitating rapid ion diffusion, but also generate extra pseudocapacitance improving specific capacitance greatly. As evidenced by electrochemical measurements, AQ/OMCs can exhibit specific capacitance as high as 346 F g(-1) in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1). Besides, the AQ/OMCs also possess excellent rate performance with capacitance retention ratio of up to 84.3% even at a very high current density of 30 A g(-1). The outstanding capacitive performance of AQ/OMCs can be ascribed to the synergic effect between OMCs and AQ, in which ordered mesoporous channels facilitate rapid ion diffusion, and AQ generates large pseudocapacitance. In addition, asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled using AQ/OMCs and OMC as negative and positive electrode, respectively, which can deliver a very high energy density of 14.51 Wh kg(-1) and excellent long-term cycle stability, retaining 96.3% of initial capacitance, after 10,000 cycles.

However, many ECHs are prone to damage during use, limiting their application. In this study, a quick and simple one-pot in situ copolymerization method was used to introduce the double network (DN) structure with good mechanical properties into the conductive hydrogel, providing a new method for preparing the multi-function DN hydrogel. A novel conductive hydrogel was prepared by introducing sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCNa) and polydopamine (PDA) reduced graphene oxide (D-rGO) into polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel. Among them, the well-dispersed D-rGO nanofillers provided a good electron conduction pathway. CMCNa/PAM matrix was physically and chemically crosslinked with Fe3+ and N, N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide (MBA), which made the hydrogel had better mechanical properties and pH sensitivity than pure PAM hydrogel. The conductive hydrogel designed by us had better sensitivity (gauge factor (GF) value was 6.44), wider strain detection range (0-500%), better cycle stability and durability compared with other conductive hydrogels by using a composite conductive mechanism of electron and ion conductivity. More notably, D-rGO/CMCNa/PAM hydrogel could detect large-scale changes in human movement (such as bending of fingers and wrists) and sensitive signals without obvious allergic reactions to human skin, which offered great possibilities for practical applications as flexible strain sensors.

In this work, a bismuth nano spheres and porous carbon composite (Bi-NS@C) is developed via an oleate-oriented dual-phase interfacial reaction and a molten salt calcination process. Materials characterizations suggest that the Bi-NS with a size of 20-30 nm are uniformly distributed in the sponge-like porous carbon network. Such a structure could enable a conductive network, prevent particle aggregation, shorten the ions transportation pathways, accommodate volume change and prevent the collapse of the electrode. As a result, this anode delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 106 mAh g(-1) after even 1000 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1). Even at 2 A g(-1), the specific capacity of the electrode can still retain at similar to 410 mAh g(-1). The remarkable electrochemical performance of the Bi-NS@C composite suggests that the as-prepared nanocomposite can simultaneously enhance the Na+ ion conductivity and electronic conductivity in the charge/discharge processes, which offer guidance in anode materials design and synthesis in SIBs.

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that the surface of graphene had been successfully functionalized. Subsequently, HBPSi-rGO was incorporated into the bismaleimides (BMI) resin to prepare composites so as to improve its performance. The tribological, mechanical and thermal properties of the composites were studied systematically. Results show that the addition of the appropriate content of HBPSi-rGO can enhance the mechanical properties including the impact and flexural strengths of the BMI resin. In addition, the thermal stability of HBPSi-rGO/BMI nanocomposites is also superior to that of the pure BMI resin. It is worth noting that when the content of HBPSi-rGO is 0.6 wt%, the frictional coefficient and the wear rate is decreased by 44.6% and 77.4%, respectively compared to those of the neat BMI. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that wear mechanism of neat BMI is mainly fatigue wear, but it turns mainly adhesive wear after the incorporation of HBPSi-rGO. The main reason can be that the interface adhesion was enhanced due to the reaction of nucleophilic addition between HBPSi-rGO and BMI matrix.

With these results, an adsorption-desorption phase diagram was established with atomic thermodynamics. The temperature (T) dependent desorption time t(T) was determined with a thermal desorption method. The results show that the optimal desorption temperature is 400 K. The effect of T on atomic structure parameters and electrical properties were analyzed. It shows that the maximum variation of electrical conductivity induced by the adsorption occurs at 400 K, indicating that the best sensing performance of the devices should be at this particular temperature.

The resulting MMC spheres has high surface areas (90.3 m(2) g(-1)), excellent magnetic response (16.99 emu g(-1)), and large mesopore volume (0.22 cm(3) g(-1)), as well as good chemical inertness and mechanical stability. The MMC spheres were used to adsorb 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) from simulated water samples. Experiment results suggest that the adsorption was favorable at acidic pH and increased with the rise of initial TCP concentration and temperature. Kinetic parameters were proved to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetics model and the equilibrium data was more favorable for Freundlich isotherm. The equilibrium absorption capacity was 210 mg g(-1) at initial TCP concentration of 20 mg L-1 and increased to 587 mg g(-1) when the initial TCP concentration was up to 100 mg L-1, which was much higher than those of other carbon-based adsorbents reported in literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the synthesis of flowerlike MMC material by using LDH as template and its application as adsorbent to remove TCP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

It was found that the N-OMCS displayed the homogeneous nitrogen dispersion, well-defined monodispersed spherical morphology with ordered mesoporous structure as well as short channel. The prepared N-OMCS-1.5-900 showed good catalytic activity, excellent stability and resistance to methanol oxidation in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The significant electrocatalytic performance could be attributed to the formation of carbon spheres with ordered mesoporous structure and short channel, which not only facilitated the mass transfer, but also provided abundant active sites on the surface. In addition, the graphitic degree and the different nitrogen species of N-OMCS-1.5-900 also played an important role in ORR. The successful synthesis and application of N-OMCS could provide a feasible method for the fabrication of heteroatom-doped ordered mesoporous carbon nanospheres and may also boost the development of the efficient metal-free electrocatalysts.

Nanoconjugates (FHAb(2)), obtained by binding detection antibody (Ab(2)) to the nanohybrids containing Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) and hollow gold sphere nanoparticles (HGNPs), were used to specifically collect the target analytes from sample solutions and serve as labels. Owing to the notable plasmonic fields spreading over inner and outer surfaces, HGNPs played key roles in amplifying the SPR response signals originating from the dielectric changes on the sensing films during the binding of Ab(1) and human IgG-Ab(2)FH complexes. In addition, FHAb(2) were also used as "vehicles" for the rapid delivery of the separated and enriched target analytes from sample solutions to the sensor surface via an external magnet. In the present method, taking advantages of the magnetic field-driven mass transfer and the significant signal amplification effect of FHAb(2), the separation and analysis of human IgG in serum samples are quite effective and sensitive. The limit of detection was 1.88 ng mL(-1), which is about 260-fold lower than that obtained by routine SPR biosensors with sandwich assay. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Silver precursor and graphene oxide (GO) with a low weight ratio were used as ink for inkjet printing into a film. After vapor phase reduction, the inserted silver nanoparticles between reduced graphene oxide (RGO) layers acted as physical separators to prevent agglomeration of the RGO and reduce the Van Der Waals force between graphene sheets. The fabricated RGO/Ag electrode presented a high electrical conductivity of 2.9 x 10(5) S/m, and could keep stable after multiple bending. Meanwhile, the reducing agent vapor entered the interior of the RGO during the vapor reducing process, which generated porous channels in the RGO/Ag electrode. The porous channels could facilitate the penetration of the electrolyte into the graphene/silver electrode, resulting in a good electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 60.6 mF/cm(2) at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, which greatly improves the property compared with the previous reports.

The catalyst was prepared by impregnation method and characterized by XRD, TG, SEM, Raman, TPH and TPO techniques. The dependence of the morphology, structure, and amount of deposited carbon over the used catalyst on the reaction temperature was studied. The results suggested that the Ni/SiO2 catalyst showed the best initial catalytic activity at 700 degrees C for the catalytic decomposition of methane, where the carbon whisker was the finest and densest, and the proportion of the well-ordered graphic was enhanced with increased reaction temperature. The largest amount of carbon deposition was observed at 550 degrees C used catalyst, and at this reaction temperature the Ni/SiO2 catalyst showed relatively the highest stability.

Promising non-noble candidates for OER are often based on transition metal oxides, while carbon-based electrocatalysts typically receive little attention due to their relatively poor performance. In this work, we present a novel method to significantly activate carbon cloth for OER by creating oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface with the assistance of peroxovanadium complexes, which have been seldom used to oxidize carbon materials. Compared to pristine carbon cloth (P-CC), the activated carbon cloth (A-CC) exhibits higher specific surface area and faster electron transfer rate. Particularly, the overpotential of A-CC (310 mV) to afford a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) is much lower than that of P-CC and even comparable to that of noble RuO2/C (280 mV), ranking A-CC among the best reported nonmetal catalysts for OER. Moreover, densely distributed VO2 (B) nanoplates in the intermediate product of VO2 (B)/CC can prevent the highly active A-CC from degrading in air for two months, which endows another excellent feature for this fabrication method.

The electric field as a novel switch for uptake/release of hydrogen for storage in nitrogen doped graphene	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							ADSORPTION	Nitrogen-doped graphene was recently synthesized and was reported to be a catalyst for hydrogen dissociative adsorption under a perpendicular applied electric field (F). In this work, the diffusion of H atoms on N-doped graphene, in the presence and absence of an applied perpendicular electric field, is studied using density functional theory. We demonstrate that the applied field can significantly facilitate the binding of hydrogen molecules on N-doped graphene through dissociative adsorption and diffusion on the surface. By removing the applied field the absorbed H atoms can be released efficiently. Our theoretical calculation indicates that N-doped graphene is a promising hydrogen storage material with reversible hydrogen adsorption/desorption where the applied electric field can act as a switch for the uptake/release processes.

Although some pseudocapacitive metal oxide/hydroxides have been selected to improve the energy density of supercapacitor, their low conductivity and inferior reversibility still need to be considered. In this work, we prepared a free-standing composite comprised of NiAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes decorated on a cotton derived carbon microfiber (CMF@NiAl-LDH) via a facile hydrothermal method. The large-scale and compressible cotton derived carbon fiber with connected three-dimensional pores served as conductive backbones for the growth of the NiAl-LDH nanoflakes. It can not only improve the conductivity of NiAl-LDH, but also amend the distribution of NiAl-LDH nanosheets, leading to both rapid electron and electrolyte ions transport kinetics. The abundant space among NiAl-LDH nanoflakes as well as developed 3D pores of CMF can accommodate the volume expansion of NiAl-LDH during long lifespan cycling. Benefited from these rational design, the as-prepared CMF@NiAl-LDH electrode exhibited significantly improved capacitive performance in terms of high specific capacitance (1667 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), excellent rate performance (68.7% retained at 15 A g(-1)) and remarkable cyclic stability (105.4% maintained after 2000 cycles) in aqueous electrolytes. The assembled CMF@ NiAl-LDH//porous carbon asymmetric supercapacitor can deliver a large energy density of 45.2 Wh Kg(-1). This investigation suggests that the prepared CMF@ NiAl-LDH electrode offers a great potential in large-scale energy storage device applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Highly isolated CoP nanoparticles encapsulated in 3D hollow nitrogen-doped carbon networks (CoP/HNC composite) are designed via polymerization of poly-dopamine (PDA) on ZIF-67 and the subsequent in-situ phosphorization. Ultrafine CoP nanoparticles (10 +/- 2 nm) are decorated in nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedral shells in a porous 3D hollow architecture. Benefiting from the unique construction, the CoP/HNC electrode delivers a high reversible long cycle-life capacity of 223 mA h g(-1) for sodium storage at 500 mA g(-1) after 700 cycles. DFT simulations indicate that Na atoms strongly bound to CoP surfaces, and significantly concentrate near CoP surfaces, beneficial for the Na ions storage in this composite material. These results suggest the CoP/HNC composite can be a promising anode material for SIBs. Besides, the designed strategy of CoP/HNC composite could be applied to fabricate other metal phosphides for electrochemical storage devices. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we show that the plasmonic photocatalysis can be significantly promoted by supporting bimetallic Au@Ag nanoalloys (NAs) on graphene oxide (GO). The obtained Au-3@Ag-1/GO (molar ratio of Au to Ag similar to 3:1) with improved synergistic effects provides a remarkable higher visible-light (>400 nm) photocatalytic activity for a complete degradation (99.36%) of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) molecules within 70 min, while about 61.74% or 62.38% via monometallic Au/GO or Ag/GO. The optimum photocatalytic performance is attributed to the production of high yield hot carriers on NAs with enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance property and the pronounced photoinduced electron-transfer ability of modified GO support by overgrowth of NAs. These findings enable the optimal Au-3@Ag-1/GO to become an appealing high-performance photocatalyst for promoting diverse photochemical reactions.

J	Zhang, YF; Li, S; Luo, TY; Gao, J				Zhang, Yifei; Li, Sheng; Luo, Tianyuan; Gao, Jing			The effect of emission trading policy on carbon emission reduction: Evidence from an integrated study of pilot regions in China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Carbon emission; Emission reduction; Emission trading system; Policy evaluation	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; INITIAL ALLOCATION; SCHEME; PERFORMANCE; IMPACTS; COMPETITIVENESS; MANAGEMENT	Carbon trading systems are increasingly used by many countries nowadays to reduce carbon emission and improve the quality of environment. To evaluate the effect of emission trading system on carbon emission reduction, this study applies a robust econometric method difference-in-difference estimation on city-level panel data in China from 2004 to 2015. The findings of this study indicate that the emission trading policy adopted in pilot regions has reduced carbon emission by approximately 16.2% and such effect is particularly prominent in eastern areas of China where the economy is more developed. Moreover, other factors such as the development of the second industry and foreign direct investment are also found to affect carbon emission. The results of this study provide evidence for the success of the emission trading system in reducing carbon emission across pilot cities and suggest that an expanded scope of carbon trading mechanism adopted in China would further control the carbon emission. Meanwhile, a multi-level emission trading system from central to local government needs to be built using a variety of market-based instruments to promote the equal development of carbon trading market in various regions with different economic development levels.

Although this battery chemistry carries many advantages, it is offset by the major challenges of producing cathodes with high loading of sulfur and applying them to large pouch cells for commercialization and ultimately realizing their value as the next generation energy storage system. Developing large and highly loaded sulfur cathodes are elusive because it introduces other problems such as causing the cathode to become less conductive and inducing the effect of polysulfide dissolution and shuttling to amplify. Herein, we present a facile approach to potentially solve the problem. We fabricated sulfur cathodes by air-controlled electro-spraying/gas-assisted electrospinning. To elaborate, gas-assisted electrospinning was implemented to form mesoporous carbon nanofiber web substrates and sulfur particles were subsequently air-controlled electrosprayed onto these fibrous materials. The same substrates were also applied as an interlayer between the cathode and separator to enhance the cycling performance. This strategy enables 3.5 mg cm(-2) loading of sulfur which exhibits an exceptionally high capacity of 1554 mA h g(-1) during the initial cycle and 1223 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at C/4. It also shows great rate capability, maintaining the capacity about 900 mA h g(-1) at 2C. The cell with even higher sulfur loading of 6.2 mg cm(-2), exhibited a high capacity of 1526 mA h g(-1) during the initial cycle, and 1005 mA h g(-1) and thus an areal capacity of 6.2 mAh cm(-2) after 100 cycles at C/4. In addition, we fabricated a large-sized thin film pouch cell (5.08 x 7.62 cm) with 5.5 mg cm(-2) of sulfur loading which delivered a capacity of 1532 mA h g(-1) during the initial cycle and 845 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at C/4. These results, demonstrate that the approach based on air-controlled electrospray of sulfur solution on a mesoporous carbon nanofiber substrate is quite promising for developing highly loading sulfur cathodes and feasible for generating large-sized pouch cells with high capacity.

In this study, random chopped carbon fiber was introduced to improve mechanical behaviors of RBSC ceramics. The effect of carbon black on the microstructure and mechanical behaviors was investigated. With the increase of carbon black, the relative density is increased and the content of silicon is reduced. At the carbon black fraction of 12wt% and fiber fraction of 30vol%, the fracture toughness reaches the peak value of 5.5 MPa.m(1/2). However, the microstructure defects increase because of the non-uniform dispersion of carbon black in the slurry. Thermal analysis indicates that the coefficient of thermal expansion is increased with the increase of carbon black, and thus the content of carbon black should be limited in considering of the thermal stability in the field of reflection mirror.

The structure and morphology of the engineered MWCNTs were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared, Raman spectroscopy and Scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the engineered MWCNTs exhibited improved dispersibility and selectivity for metal ions detection due to the introduction of nitrogen atoms and thiol groups. In addition, the developed electrode material displayed good repeatability, stability and reproducibility. This study shows the engineered MWCNTs are very promising for potential application in heavy metal ions detection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The N-doped carbon nanosheets provide a pathway for charge transfer and act as defensive layers to avoid the agglomeration of nanoparticles. The decoration of CFO nanoparticles on porous N-doped carbon nanosheets (CFO/NC) typically leads to hybrid material that displays an exceptionally high electrochemical performance for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with excellent diffusion of electrolyte ions and ensures fast Li+/e(-) transport. The initial discharge capacity reaches up to 1270mAhg(-1) (1.65mAhcm(-2)) at a current density of 500mA g(-1) (0.65mAcm(-2)). Furthermore, it also exhibits an exceptionally high specific capacity of 635mAhg(-1) at a high current density of 500mAg(-1) (500mA g(-1)) after long cycling (250 cycles) and a remarkable rate capability with 93% capacity retention. These excellent electrochemical characteristics demonstrate that CFO/NC is a promising anode material for LIBs. [GRAPHICS] .

The dissolution of CO2 in the five n-alkanes and the system volume swelling were studied through the constant component expansion (CCE) experiments in different temperatures. The pressure-volume curves of the n-alkanes-CO2 systems are not strictly two-part straight lines. The bending degree is affected by the parameters of temperature, pressure, CO2 molar fraction and n-alkanes. Bubble point pressure of the oil-CO2 system is a linear relationship with the temperature. Besides, as the CO2 fraction increases, the bubble point pressure goes up largely. There is a fact that the CO2 solubility in different kinds of alkanes is nearly the same in low pressure condition, while the solubility is inversely proportional to the carbon number in high pressure. The dissolution of CO2 may swell the system, and temperature and pressure are not the main reasons. However, the swelling factor increases quickly as the CO2 molar fraction goes up, and lowers with the carbon number increase. The oil swelling has a great significance for oilfield development and well production.

However, the micron-sized FeS2 usually suffers from poor cyclability, which stems from structure collapse, exfoliation of active materials, and sulfur dissolution. Here, we use a synergistic approach to enhance the sodium storage performance of the micron-sized FeS2 through voltage control (0.5-3 V), binder choice, and graphene coating. The FeS2 electrode with the synergistic approach exhibits high specific capacity (524 mA h g(-1)), long cycle life (87.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles), and excellent rate capability (323 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)). The results prove that a synergistic approach can be applied in the micron-sized sulfides to achieve high electrochemical performance.

This study develops a new green and effective strategy, consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) co-stabilized Pickering emulsion combined with hot-pressing technology, to prepare flexible and conductive nitrile rubber (NBR) composite films. The composite films consist of a 3D network conductive skeleton structure of reduced GO (RGO) and an isolated NBR structure. This specific design results in a maximum high conductivity of 99 S m(-1), which is higher by an order of magnitude compared with that of the composites obtained using the traditional solution blending method, and a stable EMI shielding effectiveness of 25.81 dB in the X band. The introduction of the flexible NBR results in the excellent flexibility and structural strength of the composite film, and exhibits a decrease of 2.51% in the EMI shielding efficacy after 5000 cycles. As a piezoresistive sensor for wearable devices, the CNF-RGO/NBR flexible film can hold precise current signals and respond to finger motion. The findings of this study can provide new insights for the design of conductive and flexible composites as wearable and portable medical equipment and electronic devices.

Metal-organic frameworks with their unique structure can confine polysulphides and restrain the shuttle effect. Microporous metal-organic framework MOF-76(Gd) was synthesized and applied as a support for sulphur in lithium-sulphur batteries. To achieve better conductivity, MOF-76(Gd) was carbonized and applied as a conductive nest in the sulphur cathode. Activated (AC) and carbonized (C) MOF-76(Gd) in electrode material displayed sulphur encapsulation and polysulphide confinement which was proved by stable capacity during cycling. The carbonized MOF-76(Gd) in cathode ma-terial showed an initial discharge capacity of 658 mAh g(-1), and after 200 cycles at 0.5 ?C, the capacity retention was almost 93%.

Herein, a series of amide functionalized CTFs (CTF-PO71) have been synthesized using a bottom-up strategy in which pigment PO71 with an amide group is employed as a monomer under ionothermal conditions with ZnCl2 as the solvent and catalyst. The pore structure can be controlled by the amount of ZnCl2 to monomer ratio. Benefitting from the highly porous structure and amide functionalities, CTF-PO71, as a sulfur cathode host, simultaneously demonstrates physical confinement and chemical anchoring of sulfur species, thus leading to superior capacity, cycling stability, and rate capability in comparison to unfunctionalized CTF. Meanwhile, as an adsorbent of organic dye molecules, CTF-PO71 was demonstrated to exhibit strong chemical interactions with dye molecules, facilitating adsorption kinetics and thereby promoting the adsorption rate and capacity. Furthermore, the dynamic adsorption experiments of organic dyes from solutions showed selectivity/priority of CTF-PO71s for specific dye molecules.

In this Letter, we present a graphene-embedded polymer Mach-Zender interferometer (MZI) thermo-optic switch, based on the Ex 01 mode and designed to minimize both the loss and power consumption. Based on the symmetry of a three-dimensional structure and the E-01(x) mode, the central embedded graphene electrode structure was simulated with an absorption loss of 0.06 dB/cm. Finite element method (FEM) simulations were run to find that the power consumption is 1.57 mW. Compared with the top heating electrode, the power consumption of the proposed graphene-embedded device is reduced by 74%. Further, the response speed of the graphene-embedded thermo-optic MZI switch is simulated to be 1.2 mu s (rise) and 70.6 mu s (down). This device may be applicable in the two-dimensional integrated low-power-consumption-mode division multiplexer field.

Based on energy barriers directly obtained from first-principles calculations for single-Li and twoLi intercalated BLG, a new equation was deduced for predicting energy barriers considering Li's interactions for multi-Li intercalated BLG. Our calculated results indicate that Li energetically prefers to intercalate within rather than adsorb outside the BLG. Additionally, lithium exists in a cationic state in the BLG. More excitingly, ultrafast Li diffusion coefficient (similar to 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1)) within AB-stacked BLG near room temperature was obtained, which reproduces the ultrafast Li diffusion coefficient measured in recent experiment. However, ultrafast Li diffusion was not found within AA-stacked BLG near room temperature. The analyses of potential distribution indicate that the stacking structure of BLG greatly affects its height of potential well within BLG, which directly leads to the large difference in Li diffusion. Furthermore, it is found that both the interaction among Li ions and the stacking structure cause Li diffusion within AB-stacked BLG to exhibit directional preference. Finally, the temperature dependence of Li diffusion is described by the Arrhenius law. These findings suggest that the stacking structure of BLG has an important influence on Li diffusion within BLG, and changing the stacking structure of BLG is one possible way to greatly improve Li diffusion rate within BLG. At last, it is suggested that AB-stacked BLG can be regarded as an excellent candidate for anode material in lithium-ion batteries.

Four composites containing different carbon content (0, 0.3 wt. %, 0.6 wt.% and 1 wt.%) were fabricated by powder metallurgy technology. Microstructure and tribological properties were studied. Friction behaviors were conducted on a disc-on-ball tribotester rubbing against Si3N4 ball. The carbon greatly improved the wear resistance of CoCrMo matrix composites due to the strengthening effect of carbides (Cr7C3 and Mo3Co3C) and the dense oxides film. However, the friction coefficient slightly increased. There was a critical value of carbon content for hardness and high-temperature friction and wear behaviors. The composite with 0.6 wt.% carbon had the most favorable tribological behaviors from RT to 1000 degrees C. Four composites showed different friction mechanisms. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Al doped graphene: A promising material for hydrogen storage at room temperature	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							AB-INITIO; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; CARBON NANOTUBES; ADSORPTION; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; CAPACITY	A promising material for hydrogen storage at room temperature-Al doped graphene is proposed theoretically by using density functional theory calculation. Hydrogen storage capacity of 5.13 wt % is predicted at T=300 K and P=0.1 GPa with an adsorption energy E-b=-0.260 eV/H-2. This is close to the target specified by U. S. Department of Energy with a storage capacity of 6 wt % and a binding energy of -0.2 to -0.4 eV/H-2 at ambient temperature and modest pressure for commercial applications. It is believed that the doped Al alters the electronic structures of both C and H-2. The bands of H-2 overlapping with those of Al and C simultaneously are the underlying mechanism of hydrogen storage capacity enhancement. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

Based on surface wetting state, the corrosive wear behavior of CS in oil-water fluid was investigated. The surface wetting state of the metal in oil-water fluids with different water cut and flow velocity was measured using a specially constructed device. Wear loss, corrosion loss, and corrosive wear loss of the CS samples in different oil-water fluids were measured by a reciprocating corrosive wear tester. The damage morphology of the CS samples was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the element distribution on the surface was detected by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicated that the surface water wetting rate of the metal increased with water cut and decreased with flow velocity in the oil-water fluid. Wear, corrosion, and corrosive wear behavior of the CS was related to the surface wetting film and surface reaction film. In this test range, the synergetic action is negative and chlorine embrittlement occurs in the fluid with high water cut and low velocity. The damage mechanism of the CS was abrasive wear with selective corrosion.

However, the large volume change during lithiation/de-lithiation processes, and the low intrinsic electric conductivity have seriously impeded its widespread practical application. Herein, silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) coated with CNTs-intertwined N-doped porous carbon (NPC) are prepared via a facile solution-phase method, followed by thermal annealing treatment. In this hierarchical structure, the bimetallic ZIF-derived porous carbon can shorten the migration channels of Li+ and electrons. Moreover, the formed Co nanoparticles can not only catalyze the graphitization of carbon, but also propel in-situ growth of CNTs to constitute a 3D interconnected conductive network, thereby improving the electrochemical performance. Benefiting from the unique structure, the as-prepared Si@CoSi2/Co-NPC@CNTs electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performance of 1191 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) after 200 cycles. Meanwhile, the electrode also shows excellent rate capability of 930 mAh g(-1) even at a high current density of 6 A g(-1). This work provides a new strategy to design exceptionally high electrical conductivity and structure stability of Si-based anode materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, S; Rossel, RAV; Webster, R				Li, Shuo; Rossel, Raphael A. Viscarra; Webster, Richard			The cost-effectiveness of reflectance spectroscopy for estimating soil organic carbon	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						accuracy; capacity; cost; economy; mid-infrared spectroscopy; soil organic carbon; visible-near-infrared spectroscopy	SPECTRAL LIBRARY; AUSTRALIAN SOIL; MATTER; NIR; PREDICTION; TEXTURE; DESIGN; STOCKS	Reflectance spectra of soil can be used to estimate the concentrations of organic carbon in soil (SOC). The estimates are more or less imprecise, but spectroscopy is quicker, less laborious and cheaper than conventional dry combustion analysis. Are the greater economy and efficiency sufficient to justify the loss of information arising from errors in estimation? We measured soil spectra with three instruments: a bench-top mid-infrared (mid-IR) (mid-IRb) spectrometer, a portable mid-IR (mid-IRp) spectrometer and a portable visible-near infrared (vis-NIRp) spectrometer. We calculated a quantity E to express the cost-effectiveness of spectroscopic estimates relative to the conventional analysis, by accounting for their inaccuracy, their cost and their capacity, namely the maximum number of samples that can be prepared and measured daily. In all, 562 samples of soil were collected from 150 locations at four depths on a farm. The samples were dried and ground to particle sizes of <= 2 and <= 0.5 mm before measurements were made by dry-combustion analysis. The machine learning algorithm Cubist was used to derive spectroscopic models of SOC concentrations and their uncertainties. We found that the mid-IRb on the <= 0.5 mm samples was the most accurate and expensive but nevertheless sufficiently cost-effective (large value of E) for determining the organic C. The mid-IRp was somewhat more accurate, but its E was smaller than vis-NIRp on corresponding samples because it required more time to record the spectra. We also found that, with the portable spectrometers, the SOC predictions made on the <= 0.5 mm samples were somewhat more accurate than those made on the <= 2 mm samples, but their E was smaller because of the additional cost of sample preparation. The vis-NIRp on the <= 2 mm samples was the most cost-effective for estimating SOC because it is cheap, accurate and has a large capacity for measurements. Highlights Concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC) were determined by standard dry combustion and estimated from reflectance spectra recorded by three instruments. The labour required for each of the techniques and the cost, including that of the equipment, were recorded. A quantity E, expressing the cost-effectiveness relative to dry combustion was calculated for each spectral technique, taking into account both accuracy and cost. Dry combustion was always more accurate than estimates from spectra for individual samples, and the technique was also more cost-effective for small numbers of samples. The cost-effectiveness of the spectral techniques varied among themselves, but all were more cost-effective than dry combustion for large numbers of samples.

CMK-1 coated with poly(methyl methaerylate)(PMMA)(CMK-3-PMMA and CMK-1-PMMA) and pristine mesoporous carbons CMK-3, CMK-1 were employed to adsorb vitamin B12(VB12) from water solution. Adsorption isotherm and kinetics of adsorption were investigated via batch experiments. It was found that the adsorption capacity of VB12 at 30, 40 and 50 degrees C can reach 688.2, 572.4 and 428.7 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption isotherm can be described by Langmuir model. The pseudo first- and second-order kinetic models were employed to Fit the dynamic adsorption. It was found that the dynamic adsorption follows the pseudo second-order model. The thermodynamic equilibrium coefficients obtained at different temperatures were used to evaluate the thermodynamic constants Delta G(0), Delta H(0) and Delta S(0). The negative value of Gibbs free energy, Delta G(0) indicates that the adsorption occurred via a spontaneous process. The increase in the value of -Delta G(0) with increasing temperature indicates that higher temperatures were favourable to the sorption process. The enthalpy values of Delta H(0)>40 kJ/mol(66.36 kJ/mol and 56.43 kJ/mol) for CMK-3-PMMA and CMK-1-PMMA confirm that chemisorption were involved in the adsorption process. This is consistent with the IR spectra and is another evidence for the formation of hydrogen bond between PMMA in the pore of CMK-3 and VB12.

However, the oxidation and agglomeration of nZVI limits the large-scale application of nZVI in environmental remediation. This study developed a two-step method to prepare stable carbon-coated nZVI (Fe-0@C) which combined hydrothermal carbonization and carbothermal reduction methods and used glucose and iron oxide (Fe3O4) as precursors. When the carbothermal reduction temperature was 700 degrees C and the elemental molar ratio of carbon to iron was 22:1, stable Fe-0@C can be generated. The nZVI particles are encapsulated by mesoporous carbon and embedded in the carbon spheres. The unique structure of carbon coating not only inhibits the agglomeration of nZVI, but also makes nZVI stable in air for more than 120 days. Not only that, the as-synthesized Fe-0@C exhibited high catalytic activity toward the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) by activating persulfate. Different from conventional nZVI catalysts in generation of sulfate radicals, Fe-0@C selectively induced hydroxyl radicals for 4-CP degradation. Moreover, Fe-0@C has been shown to efficiently degrade 4-CP by using the dissolved oxygen in water to form hydroxyl radicals. This study not only provides a simple, green method for the preparation of stabilized nZVI, but also provides the possibility of large-scale application of nZVI in the field of environmental remediation.

J	Li, S; Tang, JC; Wang, L; Liu, XM				Li, Song; Tang, Jingchun; Wang, Lan; Liu, Xiaomei			Carbon coating enhances single-electron oxygen reduction reaction on nZVI surface for oxidative degradation of nitrobenzene	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Carbon coating; In-situ synthesis; H2O2; Nitrobenzene; Hydroxyl radical		Research on the in-situ generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) has received more and more attention in recent years. However, the low utilization rate of nZVI, strict production conditions, and high energy consumption limit the application of this technology in actual environmental pollution remediation. In this study, carbon-coated nZVI (Fe-0@C) was used to synthesize H2O2 in situ and realize the mineralization of nitrobenzene (NB). The results showed that the composite removed 91% of NB through adsorption, reduction, and oxidation within 120 min, of which oxidation accounts for 42.92%. Not only that, the composite material could achieve effective mineralization of NB under the wide pH range of 3-7. Quantitative experiments of hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) showed that the composite could generate 185.64 mu M HO center dot in 120 min without any extra energy consumption. The carbon-coated structure effectively inhibits the formation of the passivation layer on the surface of the nZVI, thereby ensuring the high activity of the Fe-0. In addition, the carbon coating strengthens the sequential single-electron transfer process by changing the oxygen reduction pathway on the surface of the nZVI, so that the Fe degrees can efficiently generate HO center dot through the superoxide radical (O-2 center dot(-)) pathway under neutral conditions. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the in-situ synthesis of H2O2 to mineralize NB by carbon-coated nZVI. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

If FR is not managed properly, it will result in environmental problems. In this study, FR was used as a novel precursor for activated carbon (AC) production by H3PO4 activation under different conditions. Under optimum conditions, the prepared FRAC had high BET surface area (1,316.7 m(2)/g) and micro-mesoporous structures. The prepared FRAC was then used for the adsorption of Cr(VI). The effect of solution pH, contact time, initial Cr(VI) concentration, and temperature was systematically studied. Characterization of the adsorption process indicated that the experimental data were well-fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The maximum adsorption capacity of 454.6 mg/g was achieved at pH 2.0, which was highly comparable to the other ACs reported in the literatures. The preparation of FRAC using H3PO4 activation can make use of FR's characteristic acidity, which could make it preferable in practical industrial production.

Electrosorption for organic pollutants removal and desalination by graphite and activated carbon fiber composite electrodes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Electrosorption; Graphite and activated carbon fiber composite electrodes; Saline wastewater; Desalination efficiency	WASTE-WATER; CAPACITIVE DEIONIZATION; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; ELECTROCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION; AEROGEL ELECTRODES; SODIUM-CHLORIDE; CLOTH; ADSORPTION; DEGRADATION; PERFORMANCE	This paper investigates a new type of carbon-based electrodes, which were equipped with graphite and activated carbon fiber composite, to improve the performance of electrosorption. The results indicated that the highest desalination efficiency achieved 55 % and the optimal condition was 1.6 V voltage, 60 min retention time and 1.0 cm electrode distance. Freundlich isotherms successfully fitted with the respective behavior of the composite electrode and provided theoretical evidence for the desalination performance improvement. Applied in real black liquor of refined cotton, the graphite and activated carbon fiber composite electrodes achieved high removal efficiency for conductivity (59 %) and CODCr (76 %). Similar removal performance was also observed in sodium copper chlorophyll wastewater, and removal efficiency was 37 % for conductivity and 14 % for CODCr. For the first time, this research demonstrated the biodegradability improvement in real industrial wastewater via electrosorption treatment, suggesting a potential pretreatment technique for high-salinity wastewater.

This work reports the rational design and synthesis of yolk-shell-structured submicroreactors with loaded metal nanoparticles into ZnO-microporous carbon core-shell structures. The solvothermal treatment and carbonization process of uniform zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8)@resin polymer core-shell structures leads to the generation of yolk-shell-structured ZnO@carbon. The synthesis conditions are optimized to track the evolution of ZIF-8 in a confined space of resin polymer as a submicroreactor itself. It is found that nanoribbon evolution occurs via the formation of the intermediate needle-like particles. The Pd&ZnO@carbon submicroreactor is shown to be a highly selective catalyst (selectivity >99%) for hydrogenation of phenylacetylene to phenylethylene. The excellent performance of Pd&ZnO@carbon particles is evidenced by higher conversion and selectivity than that of Pd/ZnO and Pd/C with similar Pd loading. Furthermore, Pd&ZnO@carbon submicroreactors show superior catalytic stability, and no deactivation after 25 h of reaction. The proposed strategy is promising for the design of multifunctional micro/nanoreactors or nanocontainers for construction of artificial cells.

Sodium phytate (C6H6Na12O24P6), a green food antioxidant additive, is used as the electrolyte for providing both a phosphorus source and an electrolysis environment. The obtained P-GQDs exhibit excellent scavenging activity of free radicals, such as hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Combined with Raman, FT-IR, and XPS spectral analyses, the reason for high phosphorus content and the mechanism of free radical scavenging of P-GQDs are investigated in our work.

Experimental results showed that the addition of MCMBs raised the compressive strength due to the reduction of micro-cracks as well as the increase of bulk density. The thermal diffusivity increased initially and then decreased when the amount of MCMBs was raised. Compared to the particle size of MCMB, concentration makes a larger contribution to pore size and properties under the current experimental conditions.

Self-assembly formation of hierarchical mixed spinel MnCo2O4 porous nanospheres confined by polypyrrole pyrolytic carbon for high-performance lithium storage	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Mixed spine] MnCo2O4; Lithium ion batteries; Self-assembly ability; Hierarchical porous nanosphere; Polypyrrole pyrolytic carbon	SODIUM-ION BATTERIES; ANODE MATERIAL; GRAPHENE; OXIDE; NANOCOMPOSITE; NANOSHEETS; NANOPARTICLES; FABRICATION; NANOFLAKES; FOAM	The spinel MnCo2O4 characterizing metallic synergistic effect and multi-electron transfer is a promising anode material in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) fields. In the work, the MnCo2O4 porous nanospheres are prepared in virtue of self-assembly ability of glycerol micro-emulsion and subsequent annealing under appropriate temperature. Polypyrrole pyrolytic carbon is introduced to hybridize with low-dimension MnCo2O4 material to settle the common problems of intrinsic low electrical conductivity and severe volume expansion of electrode material. Because of hierarchical porous structure, polypyrrole pyrolytic carbon and metallic synergistic effect, the electrode delivers higher specific capacity, better rate capability and long-term cycling stability compared to several spinel-type oxides/carbon composites.

Developing one novel synthetic approach to increase the intimate contact between CeO2 and secondary species is of particular importance for enhancing catalytic activities. Herein, an interfacial reaction between metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon and KMnO4 to synthesize CeO2-MnO2, in which carbon is derived from the py-rolysis of Ce-MOFs under an inert atmosphere, is described. The MOF-derived carbon is found to restrain the growth of CeO2 crystallites under a high calcination temperature and, more importantly, intimate contact within CeO2/C is conveyed to CeO2/MnO2 after the interfacial reaction; this is responsible for the high catalytic activity of CeO2-MnO2 towards CO oxidation.

However, S experiences dissolution during its electrochemical reactions; hence, maintaining its initial capacity is challenging. Protecting the S cathode with a Li ion conducting layer that acts as a barrier for polysulfide transport is an attractive strategy, but formation of such protective layers typically involves significant effort and cost. Here, we report a facile route to form a conformal solid electrolyte layer on S cathodes in situ using a carbonate solvent. The chemically and mechanically stable and Li ion conducting protective layer is formed by inducing electrolyte reduction and polymerization reactions on the cathode surface. The layer serves as a polysulfide's barrier, successfully helping to retain S active material in the carbon pores. In addition, it helps to improve the performance of Li anodes.

However, aggregation-caused quenching, monotonous emission modes, and unsustainable preparation impose restrictions on their performance and practical applications. Here, this work reports the facile synthesis of sustainable silk-derived multimode emitting CDs with dispersed-state fluorescence (DSF), aggregation-induced fluorescence (AIF), and aggregation-induced room temperature phosphorescence (AIRTP) through radiating sericin proteins in a household microwave oven (800 W, 2.5 min). The structure, luminescent properties, and the mechanism are investigated and discussed. The sericin-derived CDs have graphitized cores and heteroatom-cluster-rich surfaces. The DSF corresponds to the graphitized cores and the AIF origins from the aggregation-induced abundant orbital energy levels on the heteroatom-cluster-rich surfaces. The presence of abundant hydrogen bonds and small gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states induces AIRTP. Finally, based on the unique multimode emission of the prepared CDs, their applications in high-performance white-light-emitting diode, information encryption, anti-counterfeiting, and visual humidity sensors are demonstrated.

Different ratios of the sulfur/polythiophene composites were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, and electrochemical methods. A suitable ratio for the composites was found to be 71.9% sulfur and 18.1% polythiophene as determined by CV and EIS results. Conductive polythiophene acts as a conducting additive and a porous adsorbing agent. It was uniformly coated onto the surface of the sulfur powder to form a core/shell structure, which effectively enhances the electrochemical performance and cycle life of the sulfur cells. The initial discharge capacity of the active material was 1119.3 mA h g(-1), sulfur and the remaining capacity was 830.2 mA h g(-1) sulfur after 80 cycles. After a rate test from 100 to 1600 mA g(-1) sulfur, the cell remained at 811 mA h g(-1) sulfur after 60 cycles when the current density returned to 100 mA g(-1) sulfur. The sulfur utilization, the cycle life, and the rate performance of the S-PTh core/shell electrode in a lithium-sulfur battery improved significantly compared to that of the pure sulfur electrode. The pore and thickness of the shell affected the battery performance of the lithium ion diffusion channels.

Inspired by this breakthrough, we theoretically investigate the top-site adatom on trilayer graphene (TLG) by solving the Anderson impurity model via self-consistent mean field method. The influence of the stacking order, the adsorption site, and external electric field are carefully considered. We find that, due to its unique electronic structure, the situation of TLG is drastically different from that of the monolayer graphene. First, the adatom on rhombohedral stacked TLG (r-TLG) can have a Fano-shaped impurity spectral density, instead of the normal Lorentzian-like one, when the impurity level is around the Fermi level. Second, the impurity level of the adatom on r-TLG can be tuned into an in-gap state by an external electric field, which strongly depends on the direction of the applied electric field and can significantly affect the local magnetic moment formation. Finally, we systematically calculate the impurity magnetic phase diagrams, considering various stacking orders, adsorption sites, doping, and electric field. We show that, because of the in-gap state, the impurity magnetic phase of r-TLG will obviously depend on the direction of the applied electric field as well. All our theoretical results can be readily tested in experiment, and may give a comprehensive understanding about the local magnetic moment of an adatom on TLG.

The dispersion of graphene sheets is characterized by the radial distribution function (RDF) between graphene sheets. We observe that a longer polymer chain length L-g leads to a relatively better dispersion state attributed to the formation of a better brick-mud structure, effectively screening the van der Waals interactions between sheets. By tuning the interaction strength epsilon(end-end) between end functional groups of grafted chains, we construct physical networks with various robustness characterized by the formation of the fractal clusters at high epsilon(end-end) values. The effects of epsilon(end-end) and L-g on the mechanical properties are examined, and the enhancement of the stress-strain behavior is observed with the increase of epsilon(end-end) and L-g. Structural evolution during deformation is quantified by calculating the orientation of the graphene sheets and their distribution, the stress decomposition, and the size of the clusters formed between end groups and their distribution. Then, we briefly study the effects of time and temperature on the self-healing behavior of these unique PNCs in the rubbery state. Lastly, the self-healing kinetics is quantitatively analyzed. In general, this work can provide some rational guidelines to design and fabricate matrix-free PNCs with both excellent mechanical and self-healing properties.

Herein, the hierarchical porous carbon nanotubes network (NOPCT) with well-tailored nanoarchitecture and high N/O-co-doping content (20.6 at%) is developed to present large-span application on ESSs. As for Li/Na-ion batteries, the NOPCT delivered excellent cycle stability and robust rate performance in a conventional ester-based electrolyte. Moreover, NOPCT also serving as a metal Li host can effectively guide smooth and uniform Li nucleation/growth to enhance the cycle stability of hybrid Li metal anodes. In addition, the NOPCT played an important role in the sustainability of sulfur electrodes, promising the feasibility of shared NOPCT for practical Li-S batteries. First-principle calculations demonstrate that graphitic-N and C=O function groups favor for improving electron conductivity while the pyridinic-N and C=O function group make sense for improved Li/Na adsorption and affinity through Lewis acid-base interaction, enlightening the interplay between various doped categories on improved electrochemical performance of NOPCT. This work provides profound theoretical and experimental insight into the design and development of APEMs for advanced ESSs.

It is reasonably necessary to find suitable electrode materials with unique properties for high desalination performance. Herein, fish scales (FSs) are selected as precursors for obtaining carbon materials with a hierarchical porous structure with the contributions from hydroxyapatites (HAs) templates, which are naturally contained in the FSs. The characterizations of the derived carbon show that it possesses an ultra-high specific surface area of 3,761.71 m(2) g(-1), a lot of micro/mesopores, natural heteroatomic doping sites and excellent wettability. As a result, it shows an excellent desalination capacity of 29.14 mg g(-1) and good electrode regeneration performance, proving that the fish scales-derived carbon is promising for MCDI application.

Surface-induced capacitive processes (SCP) (e.g. capacitance and pseudocapacitance) could provide fast charge/discharge capacity in conjunction with the capacity provided by diffusion-controlled intercalation processes (DIP) to address this issue. For the first time, SCP was used to design a hierarchical layered graphene composite as an anode material for high rate SIBs. The contributions of the individual sodium storage processes were quantitatively evaluated, verifying the proposed mechanism. The resultant SCP-enhanced SIB delivers an outstanding rate capacity of 120 mAh/g at 10 A/g, which is among best of the state-of-the-art carbon-based SIBs. It also demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, retaining 83.5% capacity of 142 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g after 2500 cycles. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the application of Li-S batteries is mainly hindered by the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide. To inhibit this shuttle effect, hollow Fe3O4 spheres (HFS) are prepared and used as host materials for sublimed sulfur. Due to the strong absorption between Fe3O4 spheres and polysulfide, the as-prepared S@HFS composites exhibit excellent cycle stability. As a result, the S@HFS composites show a high initial specific capacity of 1310 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C.

In this paper, functionalized MWCNTs are obtained by the acid treatment to achieve dispersion of MWCNTs in aqueous solution. Then a method combining the dispersants - sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and ultrasonication is used to further disperse functionalized MWCNTs. Some following techniques, including UV-Vis absorbance, surface tension, zeta potential and adsorption isotherm measurements are used to characterize the dispersion of functionalized MWCNTs. Meanwhile, the dispersion mechanism of functionalized MWCNTs is demonstrated using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Experimental results show that best SDS concentration for the dispersion of functionalized MWCNTs is 0.65 g/L in aqueous solution. TEM images also shows that the introduction of SDS break up the agglomeration of bundles, hence the thickness of functionalized MWCNTs is decreased greatly. The dispersing mechanism is that the surfactant and hydrophobic effects prevent functionalized MWCNTs from aggregating.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows that their nitrogen content reaches up to 4.9 atom%. Both the low thermal conductivity of N-2 and the doping of nitrogen atom make carbon unit bend to form hollow nanosphere structure. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffusion (XRD) analysis prove the presence of detected defects and a poor crystallinity on the HCNSs shell. Moreover, annealing treatment of HCNSs was carried out at 1100 degrees C/10 h and 1400 degrees C/2 h to research their fracture extension. It is found that HCNSs could grow into closed-tubes even with a shell at high annealing temperature. HCNSs were applied in direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) to evaluate their catalytic performance. The electrochemical results show that pure HCNSs doesn't have any catalysis effect, but they can greatly promote the catalytic performance of CoO, and the largest polarization current density of which achieves 1.845 A.cm(-2) at -0.7 V (vs. Hg/HgO electrode).

Electronic and magnetic properties of nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbons with grain boundary	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							CARBON; STATES; SUBSTITUTION; TRANSPORT; DEFECTS; FILMS	Grain boundary (GB) is a one-dimensional interface between two domains of materials with different crystallographic orientations. We investigate the effect of N-doping on the electronic and magnetic properties for hybrid graphene nanoribbon (GNR) with GB, using density functional theory. We find that substituted N atom energetically prefers to distribute at the GB as well as at the ribbon edges. The substituted N atom can induce a variable total magnetic moment depending on the doping sites. After N doping, the translational GB can be spin polarized with ferromagnetic order, and then several spin configurations are generated considering the magnetic couplings between the magnetic moments localized at the ribbon edges and linear translational GB. However, for N-doped GNR with tilt GB, the magnetic moment is extended and denser at the ribbon edges and linear GB. Moreover, small splits of some peaks at the Fermi level are also observed due to partial polarization of GB.	[Yu, S. S.; Zhang, X. M.; Zheng, W.

In this study, we investigated the seasonal carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) and related environmental factors in 4 cascading reservoirs (Hong Jia Du, Dong Feng, Suo Feng Ying, and Wu Jiang Du) of Wujiang River, southwest China. The results showed that pCO(2) in the surface water of these reservoirs had obvious spatiotemporal changes and generally decreased from the riverine zone to the lacustrine zone in each reservoir. In summer, pCO(2) was highest downstream of the dam because of stratification and deep water discharge for hydropower generation, whereas pCO(2) was much lower in the surface water of the lacustrine zone because of carbon removal by photosynthesis. When water temperature was low, however, pCO(2) was higher in the surface water of the lacustrine zone because of respiration and organic decomposition. Among these reservoirs, only Suo Feng Ying had CO2 emissions higher than the average value of natural lakes. In addition, CO2 emission flux showed an exponentially negative relationship with hydraulic retention time of reservoirs, based on this work and other reports of reservoirs in the Yangtze River basin.

The purposes of the current study were to seek effective ways to reduce the negative impacts of smallholder systems on the environment by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method and data from field investigations and high-yield demonstration fields with WMSs in four representative counties across the HFR. High-yield demonstration fields with optimized fertilizer management had a higher carbon balance (CB), lower carbon intensity and higher fertilizer use efficiency than smallholder fields. The CB and carbon emissions differed among counties due to differences in input and output levels. Fertilizer application contributed the most to carbon emissions from WMSs in the HFR, accounting for 34.5% of the total carbon emissions. Thus, an efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint is to reduce the difference in nitrogen application between farmers' and high-yield fields. The dominant WMS production unit in the HFR is smallholding, which requires large resource inputs and high carbon consumption for high yield. Therefore, optimizing the carbon input management of farmers' fields, especially the management of fertilizers, is crucial for promoting high-yield, low-carbon production and improving ecological benefits for WMS smallholders in the HFR, which will further promote clean and sustainable agricultural production in this region.

In this study, we have investigated the effects of montmorillonite, kaolin, and goethite on the adsorption of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and bisphenol A (BPA) on GO and rGO. Results have shown that these minerals inhibited the adsorption of E2 and BPA on GO and rGO in the order goethite > kaolin > montmorillonite. The largest inhibitory effect of goethite was ascribed to its strong electrostatic attraction with oppositely charged GO and rGO. In comparison to kaolin, the adsorption of E2 and BPA on montmorillonite had a weaker inhibitory effect on their adsorption on GO and rGO. The minerals showed greater inhibitory effects on the adsorption of E2 and BPA on GO than on rGO because of differences in the geometrical structures and properties of these nanomaterials. As confirmed by TEM, acid-base titration, FTIR, and XRD, GO sheets interacted more strongly with the minerals through wrapping their particles, cross-linking them through electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding, and/or intercalating into the interlayers of montmorillonite. These face-to-face or face-to-edge interactions occupied more adsorption sites on the surface of GO and thus resulted in a greater inhibitory effect than the spherical particle-particle interactions between rGO and minerals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the effects of natural minerals on the adsorption of pollutants on GO or rGO, which is important to assess the fate and potential risks of the released nanomaterials and co-existing pollutants in aquatic environments.

The carbon nanospheres (CNs) with good monodispersity and uniform structure were synthetized by a hydrothermal method using glucose as raw material. Then QDs functionized CNs were prepared and employed for signal amplification to improve the sensitivity and the detection limit of immunosensor. For this proposed immunosensor, chitosan was firstly deposited on the pretreated indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode surface, which promoted the electron transfer. Subsequently, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were assembled onto chitosan film modified electrode to improve the absorption capacity of antibodies. Then, primary antibodies were immobilized onto the electrode through the reaction between AuNPs and amino. At last bovine serum albumin (BSA) was employed to block the nonspecific binding sites. As a result, a novel ECL immunosensor was obtained on the prepared CN/QDs. The CEA was determined in the range of 0.005-200 ng mL(-)1, with a low detection limit of 1.2 pg mL(-1) (S/N=3). The proposed ECL immunosensor provides a rapid, simple, and sensitive immunoassay protocol for protein detection, which could be applied in more bioanalytical systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

By hydrogen pre-reduction at 850 degrees C, Fe2O3 species on iron ores were gradually reduced into Fe3O4, FeO and then finally into Fe species. After reduction of 1.6 g of iron ore catalysts of 50 m particle size with 100 mL/min pure H-2 for 3.5 h at 850 degrees C, CMD life testing was conducted at 850 degrees C and GHSV of 3.75 L/g(cat) h and the catalyst showed a stable methane conversion for 5 h. When methane decomposition proceeded on Fe sites, Fe3C species would be formed to deposit graphite around themselves to finally form carbon nano onions. This carbon nano onions material showed excellent application for wastewater purification. All samples were fully characterized with XRF, XRD, H-2-TPR, TEM and Raman.

To this end, we herein report a novel nanostructured composite consisting of approximately 75% Fe3O4 nanorods and 25% reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Microscopy and spectroscopy analyses have identified that the Fe3O4 nanorods are wrapped (or encapsulated) by the rGO nanosheets via covalent bonding, which further self-assemble into a mesoporous hybrid composite networked by the graphene matrix. The composite has an average pore size around 20 nm and exhibits a high surface area of 152 m(2) g(-1), which is 76 times as high as that of conventional Fe3O4 powder. We have used the composite as an LIB anode material to fabricate coin-type prototype cells with lithium as the cathode. Systematic half-cell testing evaluations show that the electrochemical performance of the present composite material is amongst the best of the transition metal-oxide based LIB anode materials. The performances are characterized by a high reversible capacity of 1053 mA h g(-1) subjected to 250 charge-discharge cycles at 500 mA g(-1) and an excellent rate capability with the deliverable energy of 788-541 mA h g(-1) upon the application of high current densities of 1000-5000 mA g(-1). Overall, we have demonstrated that Fe3O4 nanorod-rGO hybrid composite is an interesting and promising material for the fabrication of LIB anodes.

Carbon coating can effectively inhibit the passivation of nZVI, but its effectiveness in the soil is still unknown. This study investigated the feasibility of carbon-coated nZVI (Fe-0@C) as a persulfate (PS) activator to degrade anthracene (ANT) in soil. The results show that the Fe-0@C/PS system can remove 51.6% of ANT in the soil after 0.5 h of reaction, and reach 76.4% after 12 h of reaction. Not only that, the Fe-0@C/PS system shows a good removal effect on ANT within the initial pH range of 3-9. Free radical scavenging experiments show that superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) are mainly responsible for the removal of ANT, while O-2(center dot-) may be mainly used as a precursor for the generation of O-1(2). The activation of PS by Fe-0@C can generate a large number of free radicals, and soil components (such as beta-MnO2) can promote the conversion of O-2(center dot-) to O-1(2). Furthermore, the possible degradation pathway of ANT was also proposed. The findings are of great significance to fill up the knowledge gaps in the application of nZVI in soil remediation.

Data on the total soil organic carbon (TOC) and labile organic carbon, including easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), of the soil profile were analysed for four typical agricultural land use scenarios in the Chengdu Plain, China. The impacts of agricultural land use changes on sequestration and nutrient availability of SOC were assessed in this urban agricultural area using the space-for-time substitution method. Conversion of land use from a traditional agricultural rotation (rice-wheat/rapeseed rotation) to afforestation increased the MBC content and decreased the contents of EOC, DOC, and TOC due to the lower input of organic matter, improved aeration of the soil profile, and growth of aboveground biomass. Conversion of a traditional rotation to a rice-garlic rotation resulted in a significant increase in topsoil TOC, slight but insignificant decreases in subsoil TOC, and clear increases in labile organic carbon because of rice planting, rice straw mulch, and reasonable application of chemical fertilizers. In contrast, the conversion of a traditional rotation to a rice-leafy vegetable rotation decreased MBC due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers that consequently increased EOC, DOC, and TOC. We conclude that afforestation on paddy soil has negative consequences for soil carbon sequestration and a rice-leafy vegetable rotation contributes to carbon sequestration but is detrimental to soil fertility. In addition, the MBC ratio in soil could be the optimal indicator for assessing SOC stability and soil fertility, and more attention should be paid to subsoil carbon changes.

Assembled into Li-S batteries, the Al2O3-deposited carbon paper served as a multifunctional interlayer. The cathode of 70% sulfur content with this interlayer presented notable enhancements in electrochemical performance in contrast to that with a single carbon interlayer. At a current rate of 0.5 degrees C, the battery with the Al2O3-deposited carbon interlayer delivered a high initial capacity of 1253 mA h g(-1) and retention of 700 mA h g(-1) over 120 cycles, while the battery with the carbon interlayer delivered an approximate initial capacity of 1117 mA h g(-1) but much poorer retention of 441 mA h g(-1) over 87 cycles. The carbon side of the interlayer was placed toward the cathode as the upper current collector, which ensured the conductivity of the contact interface with the active material and promoted activation of sulfur. At the same, Al2O3 as a polar material facing toward the separator impeded the leakage of soluble polysulfides and mitigated the shuttle effect by chemical adsorption of soluble polysulfides. Combined with the interstitial structure of the interlayer acting as a physical container, Li-S batteries with this novel interlayer demonstrate superiorities in capacity, variable discharge/charge rate, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) characteristics.

However, the reversibility of sulfur removal in this technique needs to be validated. In this study, the H2S adsorption reversibility of two types of activated carbon sorbents were evaluated on a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of desorption method and desorption temperature were studied. Elevated-temperature vacuum desorption was found to be effective for regenerating adsorbents saturated with H2S. The necessities of both vacuum desorption and elevated temperature were reported. The findings were explained on the basis of the characterization results obtained using pore distribution analysis, inductively coupled plasma, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The oxidative functional groups or adsorbed O-2 reacted with H2S on the surface of the adsorbents and the resultant, i.e., elemental sulfur, damaged the pore structure. The richness of the pores with a diameter range of 0.7-0.8 nm decreased by nearly 50% after several adsorption-desorption cycles. At high temperatures and under vacuum atmosphere, element sulfur could be easily distilled and removed from the fixed bed. Thus, element sulfur would not accumulate on the adsorbent, thus ensuring the reversibility of H2S.

This voltammetric sensor showed strong accumulation ability and excellent voltammetric response for rutin. The electrochemical behavior of rutin was investigated systematically in 0.1 mol L-1 phosphate buffer solution (PBS 3.0). Under optimum conditions by square wave voltammetry (SWV), a good linear relationship was obtained between peak currents and rutin concentrations in the wider range of 5 x 10(-9) to 1 x 10(-6) mol L-1 with a detection limit of 7 x 10 (10) mol L (1). In addition, the proposed rutin sensor was successfully applied to test in real samples with good results.

However, the reservoir effect (RE), as well as old carbon contributed from the lakes catchment make it difficult to establish reliable chronologies. Here we present a systematic study of inorganic C-14 ages of two lake-sediment sequences, one from a small-enclosed saline lake - Lake Gahai in Qaidam Basin, and the other from a large freshwater lake - Lake Bosten in Xinjiang. Modern dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the lakes, paleo-lake sediments exposed in the catchment, and mollusk shells in core sediments from Lake Gahai were dated to assess the RE and the contribution of pre-aged carbon to the old ages in the cores. We propose a statistical regression to assess more than one RE for the C-14 carbonate ages within our sedimentary sequences. Old radiocarbon ages contributed by detrital carbonates were assessed by comparing the ages of mollusk shells with those of carbonates at the same sediment depths. We established the RE of the authigenic component and assessed detrital old carbon contributions to our two sites, and this was used to correct the C-14 ages. Based on this approach, we developed age models for both cores, and tested them using Pb-210 ages in both cores and TPR-based C-14-ages recovered from Lake Bosten. We further tested our age models by comparing carbonate-based oxygen isotope (delta O-18) records from both lakes to an independently-dated regional speleothem delta O-18 record. Our results suggest if sedimentary sequences are densely dated and the RE and the contribution of old carbon from detrital carbonates can be ascertained, robust chronological frameworks based on carbonate-based C-14 determinations can be established.

However, several problems limit their commercialization. One of them is the insulating nature of sulphur, which necessitates a large amount of conductive agent and binder in the cathode, reducing the effective sulphur load as well as the energy density. Here we introduce a redox mediator, cobaltocene, which acts as an electron transfer agent between the conductive surface and the polysulphides in the electrolyte. We confirmed that cobaltocene could effectively convert polysulphides to Li2S using scanning electron microscope, X-ray absorption near-edge structure and in-situ X-ray diffraction studies. This redox mediator enabled excellent electrochemical performance in a cathode with ultra-high sulphur content (80 wt%). It delivered 400 mAh g(cathode)(-1) capacity after 50 cycles, which is equivalent to 800 mAh g(s)(-1) in a typical cathode with 50 wt% sulphur. Furthermore, the volumetric capacity was also dramatically improved.

The nanofibers of the filter paper pre-coated with an ultrathin titania-gel film were further modified with polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and polysodium-p-styrenesulfonate (PSS) polyelectrolytes based on the layer-by-layer self-assemble method. Afterwards, the composite sheet was served as a host to grow MoS2 nanosheets by a hydrothermal process. Finally, the as-prepared composite sheet was carbonized in Ar atmosphere at 800 degrees C for 3 h to yield the carbon@TiO2@MoS2 composite. The resultant composite consists of titania thin layer coated carbon nanofibers with wrinkled MoS2 nanosheets (with a thickness of ca. 6 nm) anchored as an external coating layer on the surfaces. When evaluated as an anodic material for lithium-ion batteries, the carbon@TiO2@MoS2 composite delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1314.4 mAhh g(-1) and a stable reversible capacity of 597.2 mAhh g(-1) after 100 discharge/charge cycles at the current rate of 100 mA g(-1), which is higher than the theoretical capacity of the as-prepared composite electrode. The enhanced electrochemical performances of this composite were benefited from its unique three-dimensional network structures, as well as the buffering effect arising from the titania-coated carbon nanofibers, which effectively alleviates the serious volume change of MoS2 and maintains the structural integrity of the electrode during the repeated lithiation/delithiation processes.

PKS is a low-cost carbon source byproduct of biomass, which is rich in cellulose, lignin, and moisture, and its other components also provide nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus and other heteroatoms for the final product. After further activation with different ratios of alkali and carbon, porous activated carbon (PAC) with different pore sizes could be obtained. The presence of heteroatoms not only provides redox pseudocapacitance, but doping heteroatoms is also beneficial to suppress irreversible changes of the oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon material surface during the charging and discharging process. In 3 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte solution, PAC showed an excellent electrochemical performance with good cycling stability, and its maximum specific capacity could reach 380 F g(-l).

Shortened and acidified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (S-MWCNTs) were simply blended with GDY in a certain proportion to modify glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Electrochemical behavior of DA was studied on different modified electrodes. GDY showed high preconcentration to DA. S-MWCNTs facilitated the electron transport and promoted the oxidation of DA. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was applied to determine low concentrations of DA. It exhibited a linear response in the concentration range of 0.02 to 20.0 mu M with an estimated detection limit of 8.6 nM (S/N = 3). This sensor showed excellent performances for detection of DA in biological fluids.

Single Pd atoms in activated carbon fibers and their contribution to hydrogen storage	CARBON			English	Article							SPILLOVER; NANOPARTICLES; NANOTUBES; PLATINUM; CAPACITY; CLUSTERS; H-2; TI	Palladium-modified activated carbon fibers (Pd-ACF) were synthesized by melt-spinning, carbonization and activation of an isotropic pitch carbon precursor premixed with an organometallic Pd compound. The hydrogen uptake at 25 degrees C and 20 bar on Pd-ACF exceeded the expected capacity based solely on Pd hydride formation and hydrogen physisorption on the microporous carbon support. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with sub-Angstrom spatial resolution provided unambiguous identification of isolated Pd atoms occurring in the carbon matrix that coexist with larger Pd particles. First principles calculations revealed that each single Pd atom can form Kubas-type complexes by binding up to three H-2 molecules in the pressure range of adsorption measurements. Based on Pd atom concentration determined from STEM images, the contribution of various mechanisms to the excess hydrogen uptake measured experimentally was evaluated. With consideration of Kubas binding as a viable mechanism (along with hydride formation and physisorption to carbon support) the role of hydrogen spillover in this system may be smaller than previously thought.

Ecological footprint evaluation (EFE) is usually used to measure sustainability of campuses. Although it can provide guidance and reference for overall campus planning, it lacks effective significance for individual behavior, especially when the reduction of carbon emissions is the aim. On the other hand a possible solution can be represented by machine learning. It can identify the key factors that will influence individual's overall carbon emissions caused by students' daily behavior, it can be used to find effective ways to reduce individual carbon emissions. This paper applied EFE and machine learning to comprehensively evaluate campus sustainability and students' carbon emissions. Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), a "University in the Forest", was used as a study case in China. Even if HUST is endowned with a forest coverage of 72%, here we showed that its Ecological Footprint Index was -12.52, indicating strong unsustainability. This is mainly due to the high energy and food consumption, caused by the large population living in the campus and the lacking of energy saving measures. The per capita ecological footprint was relatively high, compared with other universities in the world, which meant more efforts needed to be done on ecological sustainability. Low carbon emission is a key feature for a sustainable campus. Based on the questionnaire survey delivered to 486 students who live in the campus, their daily active data were collected in terms of students' personal clothing, food, housing, consumption and transportation. And their associated carbon emissions were calculated based on emission intensities of Chinese population. Based on 486 detailed datasets, machine learning was then used to identify the key daily behavior to influence students' total carbon emission. Results showed that making behavior changes in air conditioning, food and electric bicycle were the most effective ways to reduce carbon emissions. Finally, while effective suggestions were proposed based on qualitative and quantitative evaluations, it is concluded that it is imperative for universities in China to formulate effective low-carbon policies, to achieve sustainable development and to confront global climate change.

An evaluation model for low carbon island policy: The case of Taiwan's green transportation policy	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Penghu Low Carbon Island; Green transportation policy; System dynamics	SYSTEM DYNAMICS	Conserving energy and reducing carbon emissions have become the common responsibility of the international community. During the year 2010, the Taiwan government planned a four-year project budgeted at 300 million US dollars, called "The Penghu Low Carbon Island Development Project." The policy objective is to use Penghu Island (population 85,000) as a test platform to evaluate new ways to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions before attempting to replicate the policies on Taiwan Island. For Taiwan, a zero carbon island green transportation policy will regulate the total number of electric scooters, the total number of gasoline motorcycles, influence government subsidy incentives, and create the need for new motorcycle license issuing and control. These factors interact with each other to form a complex and dynamic system that impacts policy as well as the current way of life. In this study, a system dynamics approach is designed to construct a model for evaluating the green transportation policy on Penghu Island. Simulations are conducted to model green transportation system behavior and related policy effects in a smaller, controlled environment before creating policies for Taiwan Island that will impact the lives of over 23 million people.

Particularly, the metallic Li used as the anode poses potential safety and cycle stability concerns. Alternatively, other S-battery configurations without a Li anode, i.e., lithium-ion, Li2S, or S batteries, do not suffer from the same safety concerns and can possibly serve as better methods to bring room-temperature S-based battery technologies to industry. However, whether Li2S or S will be used as the initiating cathode material remains unclear as each offers their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Here, both S and Li2S as cathodes are briefly discussed and the key benefits of Li2S are highlighted.

Here, we report the elemental, stable isotopic, and radiocarbon activity of particulate organic carbon (POC) sampled at the outlet of Huanghe in 2012-2013. We show that the Huanghe riverine POC can be explained by binary mixing of fossil (POCfossil) and non-fossil (POCnon-fossil) components, the former may reach similar to 40% of the total POC. The Huanghe POCnon-fossil is mostly sourced from C3 plants, with a mean residence time of c. 2200years. The current human-controlled hydrological regime strongly influenced the POC sources, transport modes, and fluxes. In 2012-2013, the Huanghe delivered 0.73 Tg (1 Tg=10(12)g) of POC to the sea, and about 28% of the annual POC flux occurred within a short human induced flood event. Globally, the Huanghe should be one of the largest rivers in the transfer and re-burial of fossil OC. However, the fate of Huanghe fossil OC is still unconstrained and needs to be further investigated. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Owing to the diffusion-controlled growth process of PANI, PANI with uniform fiber structure were obtained. The morphology analysis showed that the diameter of PANI nanofiber decreased with the increasing of MWCNT loading amount. Impedance analysis showed that the charge-transfer resistances of the composites were reduced also with the increasing of MWCNT loading amount. The decreasing of charge-transfer resistances and change of morphology resulted in enhanced capacitive properties. Electrochemical tests showed that the specific capacitance of PANI, PANI/MWCNT-10% and PANI/MWCNT-20% were 405, 641 and 764 Fg(-1), respectively. As comparison with pure PANI nanofiber, the specific capacitance of the composites increased by 58% and 88.6%, respectively.

The end group and molecular weight strongly affect the solubility of the PPO derivatives. The solubility of modified silicones in Sc CO2 is generally larger than that of polyethers of the same chain length. In addition, the solubility of some silicones with pendant phosphine groups in Sc CO2 was also determined. The CPP values of the phosphine-modified silicone oils increases with the number of phosphine side chains along the silicone backbone. The relationship between the solubility and structure of the PPOs and silicones is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nowadays, several approaches have been reported to improve PL quantum yield (PLQY) and regulate PL colors for their different applications. However, most reports show that higher oxygen content leads to lower PLQY. Here, we report a novel approach to enhance PLQY at high oxygen content. Both oxidation and reduction of GQDs have been demonstrated to improve the PLQY of GQDs and control their PL colors after they were first prepared. The oxidation treatment using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ultraviolet (UV) light, enhanced the PLQY of GQDs from 1.51 +/- 0.02% to 3.99 +/- 0.02%, and the PL color could also be tuned from green to yellow-green under UV irradiation. When the UV light was removed, reduction reaction occurred immediately, which further improved the PLQY to 10.37 +/- 0.01% and changed the PL color to blue. Since there was no heteroatom introduced and the GQDs maintained their original size and concentration, these treated GQDs allow us to combine the detailed structural and optical studies to testify the chemical nature of the observed PL: the PL originated from different surface states and the specific hybridization of states from the surface functional groups and the connected graphene core is responsible to specific PL colors.

Generally, the preparation of semiconductor oxide electron transport layer and perovskite involves high-temperature annealing procedure for abundant light absorption as well as efficient charge transport, which limits its flexible application. Herein, we develop an all room temperature processing high-efficiency planar C-PSCs that utilizes SnO2 as electron transport layer and a cheap polymer i.e. polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the interface passivation layer to reduce the defect state density of perovskite and facilitate valid charge transfer from perovskite to carbon. The resultant planar C-PSC devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.5% comparable to the conventional C-PSCs with annealing process, about 50% higher than that based on bare C-PSC devices without PEG. The room-temperature processing C-PSCs exhibits excellent stability, retaining around 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in air for 20 days. Furthermore, this room-temperature process is extended to the flexible C-PSCs, achieving a PCE over 10%. This work offers a facile room-temperature approach to reliably prepare efficient C-PSCs via interface modification.

Electronic transport properties of zigzag carbon- and boron-nitride-nanotube heterostructures	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Carbon nanotube; Boron nitride nanotube; Negative differential resistance; Rectifying	C-N NANOTUBES; STABILITY	Using first-principles density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism for quantum transport calculation, we have investigated the electronic transport properties of heteronanotubes by joining a zigzag (6,0) carbon nanotube and a zigzag (6,0) boron nitride nanotube with different atomic compositions and joint configurations. Our results show that the atomic composition and joint configuration affect strongly the electronic transport properties. Obvious negative differential resistance behavior and large rectifying behavior are obtained in the heterostructure with certain composition and joint configuration. Moreover, tube length and tube radius can affect strongly the observed NDR and rectifying behaviors.

J	Liu, CB; Shen, DC; Tu, ZK; Li, S				Liu, Chengbao; Shen, Dongchen; Tu, Zhengkai; Li, Song			Improved room-temperature hydrogen storage performance of lithium-doped MIL-100(Fe)/graphene oxide (GO) composite	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Adsorption; Metal-organic frameworks; Molecular simulation; Interaction strength; Interface	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; GRAPHENE OXIDE; GAS-STORAGE; ADSORPTION; MIL-101; SPILLOVER; CARBONS; MOFS	Li+ doping is regarded as an effective strategy to enhance the room-temperature hydrogen storage of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). In this work, Li+ is doped into both MIL-100(Fe) and MIL-100(Fe)/graphene oxide (GO) composite, and it is demonstrated that the hydrogen uptake of Li+ doped MIL-100(Fe)/GO (2.02 wt%) is improved by 135% compared with Li+ doped MIL-100(Fe) (0.86 wt%) at 298 K and 50 bar, which is ascribed to its higher isosteric heat of adsorption (7.33 kJ/mol) resulting from its more accessible adsorption sites provided by doped Li+ ions and ultramicropores. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation reveals that Li+ ions distributing in the interface between MIL-100(Fe) and GO within MIL-100(Fe)/GO composite is favorable for hydrogen adsorption owing to the increased number of adsorption sites, thus contributing to the enhanced hydrogen storage capacity. These findings demon-strate that MIL-100(Fe)/GO is a more promising Li+ doping substrate than MIL-100(Fe). (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

These free radicals can deepen the oxidized or reduced level of working electrode in electrochemical process and thus lead to GQDs with high concentration and small size, but different surface oxidized degree. The improved oxidation and reduction mechanism were analyzed in this work. Meanwhile, the optical properties and oxidizability of GQDs with different surface oxidized degree were investigated. It is found that these GQDs can be used as an oxidizing agent and their oxidizability is related to the degree being oxidized.

The fabricated VNCNF and CNF were sandwiched between the cathode and separator to be used as interlayers. The lithium-sulphur (Li-S) cell employing the VNCNF interlayer exhibited high initial charge and discharge capacities of 1452 and 1480 mAh g-1, corresponding a coulombic efficiency higher than 100% at a rate of 0.5 C, whereas the cell with the CNF interlayer delivered the initial charge and discharge capacities of 858 and 772 mAh g-1, respectively, corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of 89.97%. Even after 400 cycles, the cell with the VNCNF interlayer retained a remarkable high capacity of 923 mAh g-1, whereas the cell with the CNF interlayer showed only 586 mAh g-1 at a rate of 0.5 C. Furthermore, the cell with the VNCNF interlayer exhibited an excellent rate capability of up to 2 C, which was much higher than those of the cells with CNF and without an interlayer. The better performance of Li-S cell with the VNCNF interlayer is attributed to the strong adsorption ability of VNCNF for polysulphide by suppressing the shuttle effect. In addition, the catalytic effect of VN in CNF accelerated the capturing and utilisation of the dissolved active materials, thereby enhancing the Red-Ox kinetics and capacity.

J	George, C; Morris, AJ; Modarres, MH; De Volder, M				George, Chandramohan; Morris, Andrew J.; Modarres, Mohammad H.; De Volder, Michael			Structural Evolution of Electrochemically Lithiated MoS2 Nanosheets and the Role of Carbon Additive in Li-Ion Batteries	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							ENHANCED LITHIUM STORAGE; AB-INITIO; ANODE; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; NANOPARTICLES; ELECTROLYTE; COMPOSITES; MECHANISM; NANOTUBE	Understanding the structure and phase changes associated with conversion-type materials is key to optimizing their electrochemical performance in Li-ion batteries. For example, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) offers a capacity up to 3-fold higher (similar to 1 Ah/g) than the currently used graphite anodes, but they suffer from limited Coulombic efficiency and capacity fading. The lack of insights into the structural dynamics induced by electrochemical conversion of MoS2 still hampers its implementation in high energy-density batteries. Here, by combining ab initio density-functional theory (DFT) simulation with electrochemical analysis, we found new sulfur-enriched intermediates that progressively insulate MoS2 electrodes and cause instability from the first discharge cycle. Because of this, the choice of conductive additives is critical for the battery performance. We investigate the mechanistic role of carbon additive by comparing equal loading of standard Super P carbon powder and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The latter offer a nearly 2-fold increase in capacity and a 45% reduction in resistance along with Coulombic efficiency of over 90%. These insights into the phase changes during MoS2 conversion reactions and stabilization methods provide new solutions for implementing cost-effective metal sulfide electrodes, including Li-S systems in high energy-density batteries.

The porous and active surface of MNCDs enables uniform growth of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets. When the MNCD@MoS2 composite is used as the anode material of Li-ion batteries, a reversible capacity of 915 mAh g(-1) can be obtained even at the extremely high current density of 10 A g(-1). The ultrafast charge/discharge ability of MNCD@MoS2 can be attributed to its unique core-shell structure with the inner MNCDs serving as the reservoir of Li-ions and transport media of electrons.

Morphological structure, textural properties, surface elements and functional groups of sludge carbon (SC) and PSC are compared. S-BET and pore volume of PSC are about three times higher than those of SC. PSC with large fluffy cavities remains some memory of SC parent structure. Removed fractions can be considered as a natural template for producing a hierarchical porous structure in PSC. Abundant oxygen-containing groups including hydroxyl and epoxide are generated in PSC, which are favorable for organic contaminant removal from wastewater. Diffraction peaks at 2 theta = 45 degrees, bending modes of Si-O-Si and Na1s peaks (1070.5 eV) jointly confirm that only a trace of adsorbed impurities (Na2O center dot(SiO2)(x) (x >= 1)) is retained on PSC surface. PSC is superior to SC and comparable to commercial activated carbon for rhodamine B and phenol adsorption capacity. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Microporous carbon (ZIF-C) with a homogeneous pore size of 0.5 nm is obtained through direct pyrolysis of ZIF-8. Mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) with an average pore size of about 4.0 nm is achieved using SBA-15 as hard template. Microporous ZIF-C exhibits considerably higher capacity and better reversibility than mesoporous CMK-3 as anode material for Na-ion batteries. In addition, it is found that microporous ZIF-C can greatly reduce the irreversible capacity loss (reductive decomposition of electrolyte) of the first cycle and enhance the reversibility of Na+ storage during the subsequent cycles.

An electrochemical sensor based on the ZnO-CuO/PCS was fabricated for simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA). Three well-resolved anodic peaks along with greatly increased peak currents were obtained at the ZnO-CuO/PCS modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) on the differential pulse voltammograms. The anodic peak separations at the ZnO-CuO/PCS/GCE were 204 mV between AA and DA and 132 mV between DA and UA. Notably, the analytical performances of the ZnO-CuO/PCS outperform those of ZnO/PCS and CuO/PCS, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two metallic oxides, i.e., the formation of p-n heterojunctions between p-type CuO and n-type ZnO allows sensitive transduction into remarkable changes in the electrochemical signals. The ZnO-CuO/PCS/GCE also presented high anti-interference ability, storage stability and repeatability in the determination of AA, DA and UA. Finally, the practical applicability of the prepared sensor was successfully demonstrated by the simultaneous determination of AA, DA and UA in human urine samples.

Rather than the volatility, the dipole moment of solvent plays a more important role in determining the densification level. The fibres densified by highly polar but non-volatile solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone were 100-200 MPa stronger than those by ethanol and acetone. Ethylene glycol is the most efficient solvent due to its two polar OH groups and improved the fibre strength to 1.45 GPa. Long chain or crosslinked polymers like polyvinyl alcohol, polyimide, and bismaleimide (BMI) were introduced into CNT fibres by infiltration with aid of polar solvents. These polymers reinforced the fibres significantly, as they can connect non-neighboring CNTs and benefit the load transfer. The strongest CNT/BMI fibre was 2.38 GPa in strength and 110 GPa in modulus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is a big concern with respect to the environment and climate changes and so on. A kind of ground-based low-resolution remote sensing system and a real-time spectral inversion method are presented for the real-time remote sensing column concentration of carbon dioxide. Based on continuous observation of this system in Hefei, the total atmospheric transmittance is real-timely obtained from the solar absorption spectrum. The column concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen are inversed from total atmospheric transmittance by line-by-line nonlinear least squares spectral inversion algorithm. The column concentration of oxygen is used as internal standard function to obtain the column average volume mixing ratio of carbon dioxide in total dry air column, and the precision is better than 3%. The average volume mixing ratio of carbon dioxide in dry-air column, from 12: 00 to 15 : 00 on September 25, 2012, is compared with observation results by Japanese greenhouse-gases satellite over the site in this period, showing that the relative deviation is less than 1%. Obviously, it is an effective way to measure greenhouse gases concentration with high precision and accuracy.

Dynamic characteristics of multi-walled carbon nanotubes under a transverse magnetic field	BULLETIN OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Dynamic characteristics; multi-walled carbon nanotubes; transverse magnetic field; van der Waals force	INITIAL STRESS; NANOMECHANICS; NANOPARTICLES; STIFFNESS; SHELL	This paper reports the results of an investigation into the effect of transverse magnetic fields on dynamic characteristics of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). Couple dynamic equations of MWNTs subjected to a transverse magnetic field are derived and solved by considering the Lorentz magnetic forces induced by a transverse magnetic field exerted on MWCNTs. Results show that the transverse magnetic field exerted on MWNTs makes the lowest frequency of the MWNTs nonlinearly decrease and the highest frequency, changeless. When the strength of applied transverse magnetic fields is larger than a given value the two walls of MWNTs appear in the radial and axial coaxial vibration phenomena.	[Li, S.; Xie, H.

In this work, we solve these problems through realizing 3D structural VN microsheets shelled with N-doped carbon layer (VN@NC) by introducing melamine as nitrogen source and PVP as carbon source. The as-prepared VN@NC electrode display high capacitance of 368 F g(-1) and good rate property. A solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with NiCo2O4 nanowires as cathode materials and VN@NC as anode materials was fabricated. The ASC device exhibits the high energy density of 65.3 W h kg(-1), and good cycling stability (92% capacitance retention) after 4000 cycles. Moreover, the ASC device shows good mechanical flexibility with negligible capacitance loss after 1000 bending cycles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Herein, we describe chemical and electronic coupling of the redox-active organosulfur moiety (-S-S-S-) with carbon nanotube (CNT) networks for high power and long cyclability of Na-organosulfur hybrid energy storage devices. The facile and reversible surface redox kinetics of organosulfur-tethered CNT is associated with a two-electron transfer toward the formation of low-order polysulfide, as confirmed by in situ and ex situ analyses. The specific capacitance of SOS-OCNT is 377 F g(-1) (94% of theoretical capacitance) and 61.3% of capacitance is retained at 10 A g(-1). The Na-organosulfur hybrid full cells deliver an ultrahigh power density of 13.4 kW kg(-1) and high energy density of 27 Wh kg(-1) over 50000 cycles.

The results reveal that the surface layer has transformed into nanocrystalline structure. Its friction and wear behaviors have been studied compared with the untreated sample on a reciprocating friction tester. The results show that the friction coefficient of the treated specimen is markedly decreased, and its wear volume loss is reduced under the low loads and middle loads. The SEM observation of the wear scars shows that the nanocrystalline layer may reduce the effect of fatigue wear. So the friction and wear properties of the low carbon steel can be improved by means of surface nanocrystallization.

Relationships between damage size and action integral were also elucidated. Results showed that damage appearance of carbon woven fabric/epoxy laminate presents circular distribution, and center of the circle located at the lightning attachment point approximately, there exist no damage projected area dislocations for different layers, visual damage territory represents maximum damage scope; visible damage can be categorized into five modes: resin ablation, fiber fracture and sublimation, delamination, ablation scallops and block-shaped ply-lift; delamination damage due to resin pyrolysis and internal pressure exist obvious distinguish; project area of total damage is linear with action integral for the same type specimens, that of resin ablation damage is linear with action integral, but no correlation with specimen type, for all specimens, damage depth is linear with logarithm of action integral.

It was found that the two isomers can be completely separated by CV method on cathode polarized GCE (PGCE) after its anodic oxidation. This facile processing method solves the difficulty of electrode surface regenerating which disturb most modified electrodes for the complex composition ease of being contaminated by the analytes in measurement. Morphology and composition of the PGCE were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In addition, the reaction kinetic of HQ and CC reaction on the PGCE was investigated. It was found that the reaction kinetics of HQ and CC is a surface adsorption-controlled process at low concentration and a diffusion-controlled process at high concentration.

High-capacity and long-life electrode materials are essential for the next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) with high power density and high energy density. Herein, FeCo-Nx doped hollow shelled polyhedrons excessively covered with a 3D network of carbon nanotubes (FeCo-N-x@CNTs) have been successfully developed and investigated as one of the most promising materials for lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. We developed a self-template strategy to synthesize a series of FeCo-Nx@CNTs via one step carbonization process of Fe doped ZIF-67 MOF. Such a FeCo-Nx doped 3D network of carbon nanotubes effectively tolerates the volume strain and prevents the metal nanoparticles aggregation. In the interim, the 3D network of porous N-doped carbon nanotubes agrees fast electron transport to accomplish remarkably excellent rate capability. Consequently, the FeCo-N-x@CNTs-1.5 shows excellent electrochemical activity for Li-ion hopping in LIBs and SCs. Additionally, this effort also unveils the synergistic effect of the iron doping on the Li-ion storage capability.

Moreover, the primitive nature of small particle size, large specific surface area and high surface energy of glucose carbon microspheres make them prone to aggregate and thus, disperse no-effectively for the other extended application. To solve this dilemma, polyester (PET) fibers decorated with glucose carbon microspheres (GC@PFs) were herein fabricated by one-step hydrothermal carbonization with acrylic acid as a coupling agent. The products were characterized by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Boehm titration, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermo-gravimetric Analysis (TG), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and zeta potential respectively. The experimental results showed that a large amount of glucose carbon microspheres were evenly dispersed on the surface of carboxyl activated polyester fibers with uniform particle diameter, and the composite fibers showed desirable adsorption ability of cationic dyes for its more negative zeta potential. The dye adsorption isotherm follows Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model better. Remarkably, the adsorbent has an excellent recyclability for maintaining a high removal rate (> 85%) to dye even after 10 cycles.

Carbon nanotube oscillators encapsulating a platinum nanocluster: A molecular dynamics study	PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES			English	Article						Carbon nanotube; Oscillator; Platinum nanocluster; Molecular dynamics simulation	SELF-DIFFUSION; SIMULATION; BEHAVIOR; SILICON	Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study carbon nanotube (CNT) oscillators that encapsulate an oscillating platinum nanocluster. Our calculations show that the nanocluster has a nearly constant motion except at the two ends of CNT, where the nanocluster is accelerated due to the potential gradient between its parts that are outside and inside the CNT. The oscillation frequency omega is found to increase with the temperature below 400 K and almost does not vary between 400 and 800 K. The calculated Lindemann index and radial distribution indicate that the platinum cluster starts to melt at 800 K and hence omega decreases and fluctuates considerably with the temperatures higher than 800 K. The relation between omega and the number of atoms n in platinum cluster is also studied. It is found that omega first decreases with n. When n exceeds a threshold value, the part of nanocluster running beyond the ends of CNT is deformed evidently, leading to fluctuations of omega with n. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We investigated the effect of the number of grooves, groove width, groove depth, and the conductivity of material on the enhanced transmission of terahertz waves. By placing the grooves at the near field of the aperture, strongly localized electromagnetic fields are effectively coupled to the aperture with a radius that is 200 times smaller than the resonance wavelength. We demonstrated that 2.4 fold enhancement factor could be obtained with a subwavelength bull-eyes surrounded by three concentric periodic grooves. Our results show that the high transmission from an aperture with grooves is assisted by coupling to the surface plasmons.

Covalent Encapsulation of Sulfur in a MOF-Derived S, N-Doped Porous Carbon Host Realized via the Vapor-Infiltration Method Results in Enhanced Sodium-Sulfur Battery Performance	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						metal-organic frameworks; S; N-doped carbon hosts; sodium-sulfur batteries; vapor-infiltration method	TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; SOLID-STATE BATTERIES; LI-S; CATHODE; MICROSPHERES; ELECTRODE; MEMBRANE; METALS	Practical applications of room temperature sodium-sulfur batteries are still inhibited by the poor conductivity and slow reaction kinetics of sulfur, and dissolution of intermediate polysulfides in the commonly used electrolytes. To address these issues, starting from a novel 3D Zn-based metal-organic framework with 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid and 1,4-bis(pyrid-4-yl) benzene as ligands, a S, N-doped porous carbon host with 3D tubular holes for sulfur storage is fabricated. In contrast to the commonly used melt-diffusion method to confine sulfur physically, a vapor-infiltration method is utilized to achieve sulfur/carbon composite with covalent bonds, which can join electrochemical reaction without low voltage activation. A polydopamine derived N-doped carbon layer is further coated on the composite to confine the high-temperature-induced gas-phase sulfur inside the host. S and N dopants increase the polarity of the carbon host to restrict diffusion of sulfur, and its 3D porous structure provides a large storage area for sulfur. As a result, the obtained composite shows outstanding electrochemical performance with 467 mAh g(-1) (1262 mAh g((sulfur))(-1)) at 0.1 A g(-1), 270 mAh g(-1) (730 mAh g((sulfur))(-1)) after 1000 cycles at 1 A g(-1) and 201 mAh g(-1) (543 mAh g((sulfur))(-1)) at 5.0 A g(-1).

Here we report a novel template approach to synthesize mesoporous Fe-N-doped carbon catalysts encapsulated with Fe3C nanoparticles. In this approach, the layer-structured FeOCl was first used as a template for the synthesis of a three-dimensional polypyrrole (PPy) structure. During the removal of the FeOCl template, the Fe3+ can be absorbed by PPy and then converted into Fe3C nanoparticles and Fe-N-C sites during the pyrolyzing process. As a result, the as-prepared catalysts could exhibit superior electrocatalytic ORR performance to the commercial PtiC catalyst in alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the Zn-air battery assembled using the mesoporous carbon catalyst as the air electrode could surpass the commercial Pt/C catalyst in terms of the power density and energy density.

A series of SiMP-CMSs/PET fiber were prepared by the melt spinning method. By investigating the thermal stability, flame retardancy, flame-retardant mode, crystallization and orientation degree of PET composite fiber, the results showed that, with the addition of 0.9 wt% SiMP-CMSs, the LOI value and vertical combustion grade of SiMP-CMSs/PET composite fiber was 27.4% and B1 level. The main flame-retardant mode of SiMP-CMSs/PET fiber was 31.33% physical barrier, 36.04% flame inhibition and 11.12% catalytic charring. The thermal decomposition temperature was delayed, and the residual amount increased from 11.34% to 16.13%. With the accelerated crystallization rate and the increased grain orientation, the aggregated structure of SiMP-CMSs/PET fiber was also optimized.

However, the shutting effect and slow conversion rate of soluble lithium polysulfides/polyselenides (LiPSs/LiPSes) compromise the practical application of Li-SeS2 batteries. Herein, a ZIF-67@PAN-derived Co-N-C@C multifunctional porous membrane as the LiPSs/LiPSes trapping barrier for Li-SeS2 batteries is proposed. The hierarchical porous conductive network facilitates the transport of electrons/lithium ions. Meanwhile, the Co-N-C architecture not only has chemical interaction for trapping the mobile LiPSs/LiPSes, but also catalyzes the LiPSs/LiPSes conversion reaction during the cycling process. Benefiting from the multifunctional capabilities, the constructed Li-SeS2 cells with the aforementioned interlayer exhibit a high capacity utilization of 978 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), together with an excellent rate capacity of 532 mAh g(-1) at 3 A g(-1) and also superior cycle life with a capacity of 557 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 A g(-1). More strikingly, they show promising capacity with stable cell performance with a mass loading of 4 mg cm(-2).

In this contribution, we report the enhanced stability of highly dispersed Pt NPs on surface-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) against thermal and electrochemical sintering by N heteroatoms in the N-doped carbon support. The improved antisintering property of Pt NPs under thermal condition is characterized by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the stability in electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is further examined at identical location (IL) using an advanced IL-TEM technique. A correlation of the Pt NP growth with the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and the mass activity in MOR has been inferred. Our results indicate that both the surface oxygen groups and nitrogen-doped species are responsible for the fine dispersion of Pt NPs on the surface-modified CNTs, while the Pt NPs can be effectively stabilized under thermal and electrochemical conditions through the strong metal-support interaction via N heteroatoms. We further reveal that the mass activity of Pt NP is closely associated with the ECSA rather than directly affected by N-doping to CNTs.

However, the poor conductivity and the volume change are still hindering its practical applications. In this work, a rambutan-inspired structure is designed to fabricate amorphous SiO2@N, P co-doped porous carbon frameworks from biomass. The carbon shell could connect with each other, providing good conductivity. After partially etching of the SiO2, the yolk-shell structure could buffer the volume changes of SiO2 during the charge/discharge processes without destroying the conducting shell. Besides, N, P doping and graphite nano crystallites in the frameworks could also offer more active sites for Li+ storage. As a result, the composite can not only exhibit excellent rate performance nearly 300 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 2000 mA g(-1), but also deliver a surprisingly stable reversible capacity of 373 mAh g(-1) over 1000 cycles at the current density of 500 mA g(-1) with the Coulombic efficiency beyond 99%. Considering the facile preparation and satisfactory lithium storage abilities, this composite design could be able to extend for practical battery application.

The objective of this study was to investigate the formation, biodistribution and cytotoxicity of CQDs in roasted Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the CQDs were mainly composed of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. The morphology, functional groups and optical properties were highly dependent on the roasting time. In vivo experiments in mice demonstrated that the CQDs distributed in the digestive tract, kidney, liver, and even brain, which indicated that they could cross the blood-brain barrier. The cell imaging results indicated that the CQDs could readily gain access to the normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, and caused autophagosome formation. The proportion of live cells decreased to 34.62% at 6 mg mL(-1) of CQDs, and the energy generation route was changed from aerobic to glycolytic metabolism.

However, the effect of spatial confinement by micropores in the electrochemical behavior of carbon/selenium materials remains ambiguous. A comparative study of using both microporous (MiC) and mesoporous carbons (MeC) with narrow pore size distribution as selenium hosts is herein reported. Systematic investigations reveal that the high Se utilization rate and better electrode kinetics of MiC/Se cathode than MeC/Se cathode may originate from both its improved Li+ and electronic conductivities. The small pore size (<1.35 nm) of the carbon matrices not only facilitates the formation of a compact and robust solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) with low interfacial resistance on cathode, but also alters the insulating nature of Li2Se due to the emergence of itinerant electrons. By comparing the electrochemical behavior of MiC/Se cathode and the matching relationship between the diameter of pores and the dimension of solvent molecules in carbonate, ether, and solvate ionic liquid electrolyte, the key role of SEI film in the operation of C/Se cathode by quasi-solid-solid mechanism is also highlighted.

To make good use of their luminescent property and nanoscaled size, we developed CDs as a vaccine delivery system for intranasal immunization in this work. To this aim, polyethylenimine-modified CDs were prepared via a simple microwave method. Intranasal immunization was performed by using the CDs as an antigen carrier to deliver model protein antigen ovalbumin. The results showed that the CDs as an intranasal vaccine delivery system enhanced the immunization efficacy by significantly increasing IgG titer, IgA induction in the local and distant mucous membrane sites, splenocyte proliferation, cytokine IFN-gamma secretion by splenocytes, and memory T cells. From the results, the CDs could be used as vaccine delivery systems with the advantage of tracing the antigen transportation from administration site to the lymph organs.

However, the preparation of CNTs generally involves cumbersome equipment and time-consuming processes. Here, we report an ultra-fast carbothermal shock (CTS) approach for synthesizing CNTs with a simple homemade setup by employing Joule heating of a carbon substrate. Carbonized silk fabric (CSF) loaded with transition metal salts in ethanol solution was used as the substrate, which was treated with a pulse voltage of 40 V for only 50 ms and then covered with uniform CNTs grown with bimetallic alloy catalyst nanoparticles (diameter: similar to 9 nm). The temperature ramp rate is as high as 10(5) K/s. The as-obtained sample has a unique fluffy structure similar to the trichobothrium of spiders, endowing it versatile applications such as airflow sensors or air filters. The CTS technique presents an easy-accessible and highly efficient approach for synthesizing CNTs, which may be also applied in synthesizing other nanomaterials.

In this work, the proposed material for the absorber is a compressible carbonated reduced graphene oxide/Fe3O4 (C-rGO/Fe3O4) carbon foam with hollow microspheres and a concave-convex microstructure. Its unique porous structure can strengthen the multiple reflections of electromagnetic waves and improve the system's mechanical properties. The C-rGO/Fe3O4 carbon foam possesses excellent comprehensive electromagnetic wave absorption performance (reflection loss (RL) value of -57.50 dB and effective bandwidth of 6.72 GHz) and exhibits convenient RL value regulation (when varying compressive strains). The RL value of the carbon foam can be adjusted within the absorption range of RL <= -20 dB or switched between <=-20 dB and RL <= -10 dB, exhibiting a smart function-tunable or function-switchable feature. Moreover, the compressible carbon foam also exhibits excellent fatigue durability and can be used to monitor human physiological signals. This provides a promising platform for practical applications in adjustable electromagnetic wave absorption; the material can also be used for wearable electronics.

It was found that nanodiamond is more stable than nanographite when the crystal size approaches the deep nanoscale. With theoretical and experimental data, a size-dependent temperature-pressure phase diagram of carbon is developed and established. It shows that the diamond/graphite/liquid triple point shifts toward lower temperature and pressure regions with decreasing nanocrystal size.

As the content of carbon dioxide in argon shielding gas increases from 0 % to 20 % then to 100 % during 10 kW high power fibre laser welding, the interdendritic delta-ferrite in weld joints changes from lathy, short strip and trivial structures to thick-long strip with short secondary dendrite arms then to skeletal-network structure. Oxide inclusions, observed in 100 % carbon dioxide shielded weld, promote the formation of the skeletal-network structure of delta-ferrite and the homogenization of chromium and nickel in weld joint. The 100 % argon shielded weld joint has a highest initial corrosion current density, the 80 % argon containing 20 % carbon dioxide shielded weld has a lowest pitting potential, while the 100 % carbon dioxide shielded weld has a highest initial corrosion potential. The microstructures and element distribution play important role in determining the corrosion properties of the weld joints.

However, the extreme reaction conditions and abundant carbon released by this process make it important to develop a greener NH3 production method. The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is an attractive alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. Herein, we demonstrated that molybdenum sulfide on nickel foil (1T-MoS2-Ni) with low crystallinity was an active NRR electrocatalyst. 1T-MoS2-Ni achieved a high faradaic efficiency of 27.66% for the NRR at -0.3 V (vs. RHE) in a LiClO4 electrolyte. In situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ X-ray photoemission analyses showed that lithium ions were intercalated into the 1T-MoS2 layers during the NRR. Moreover, theoretical calculations revealed the differences between six membered rings formed in the 1T-MoS2 and 2H-MoS2 systems with Li intercalation. The bond distances of d(Mo-N) and d(N-Li) of in Li-1T-MoS2 were found to be shorter than those in Li-2H-MoS2, resulting in a lower energy barrier of N-2 fixation and higher NRR activity. Therefore, 1T-MoS2-Ni is promising as a scalable and low-cost NRR electrocatalyst with lower power consumption and carbon emission than the Haber-Bosch process.

Here, we report small blinking single-layer graphene oxide nanosheet (GONS) that serves both as a nanoscopy fluorophore and as a drug-bearing nanocarrier for addressing such a task. The GONS blinks spontaneously with a low duty cycle (similar to 0.003), high photon output (similar to 3000 photons per switching event), and higher photostability than organic dyes, thus affording well for single molecule localization-based super-resolution imaging. Applying the localization analysis, we reveal GONS clustering size, GONS number in each cluster, and the number fraction of GONSs that participate in clustering at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm, respectively, and track their evolutions over 24 h. The data suggest that the nanocarrier clustering and distribution at the cell surface control their endocytosis and accumulation inside the cell. This process is drug-independent during which drug transportation into the destination relies on its own loading and escaping capability. Thus, this work demonstrates the great potential of the dual-functional GONS in quantitative super-resolution imaging of drug carriers in cells, which is helpful for the rational design of a smart drug delivery system aiming at achieving full therapeutic capacity.

The effects of heat treatment on the corrosion resistance of carbon steel coated with LaMgAl11O19 TBCs were investigated in 3.5wt% NaCl solution using polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that a large number of cracks are found in the LaMgAl11O19 TBCs after the samples are heat-treated, including some through-thickness cracks. The corrosion forms of the as-sprayed and heat-treated TBCs are uniform corrosion and pitting corrosion, respectively. The as-sprayed TBCs exhibit three EIS time constants after being immersed for less than 7 d, and then a new time constant appears because of steel substrate corrosion. When the immersion time is increased to 56 d, a Warburg impedance (W) component appears in the EIS data. The EIS data for the heat-treated TBCs exhibit only two time constants after the samples are immersed for less than 14 d, and a new time constant appears when the immersion time is increased further. The heat treatment reduces the corrosion resistance of carbon steel coated with LaMgAl11O19 TBCs. The corrosion products are primarily gamma-FeOOH and Fe3O4.

The variations between the fluorescence intensity of each emission component and incident energy are described by linear fitting. The results show that short-wavelength light (ultraviolet band) is conducive to calibrate the CsI(Tl) scintillator detector.

To achieve this, a super hydrophilic nano Carbon Dots (CDs) with quantum size of 6.8 nm was self-synthesized and successfully incorporated into the selective layer of polyamide (PA) thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) RO membrane. The novel CDs-TFN RO membrane was fabricated by dispersing the CDs nanoparticles at varying quantities into aqueous solution through interfacial polymerization (IP) of monomers of m-phenylenediamine (MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC). Using Excitation and emission matrix (EEM) to explore the incorporation of CDs into the membrane skin layer, we observe that the fluorescence properties of CDs-TFN membrane decreased in order of increasing CDs concentration in relation to the unmodified TFC RO membrane which has the highest fluorescence count. The surface morphology of all TFN membranes transform from a leaf-like structure into ridge-and-valley structure with increased roughness, which has an important implication for flux enhancement. The TFN membrane with 0.02 wt% CDs incorporation exhibited promising desalination performance with water flux of 87.1 L/m(2)/h and salt rejection of 98.8% than the control thin film composite (TFC) membrane (2000 ppm NaCl solution, 25 degrees C, 1.55 MPa). The improved performances of CDs-TFN membrane were attributed to the enhanced hydrophilicity, decreased thickness as well as the increased density of the selective layer due to the incorporation of small amounts of CDs nanoparticles. By extending the deposition time of CDs on the polysulfone substrate, the membrane performance was further improved with water flux of 88.7 L/m(2)/h and salt rejection of 99.0%.

Two different types of active defects are constructed simultaneously through the decomposition of sodium lignosulfonate in NO-PCMs, exhibiting hierarchical porosity and abundant heteroatoms contents. The typical NO-PCMs displayed high specific capacitance (300 Fg(-1) at 0.1 Ag-1) and outstanding cycling stability (99% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles at 10 A g(-1)) in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the assembled symmetric supercapacitors exhibited high specific capacitance of 162 F g(-1) at 20 A g(-1), 71% capacitance retention at current density up to 20 A g(-1), and possessed high specific energy density of 21.6 Wh kg(-1) with an excellent power density of 92 W kg(-1) operated in the wide voltage range of 1.8 V in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, demonstrating the broad prospects of biomass/ biowaste being used to prepare electrode materials.

Herein, high yield carbon dots (CDs) with abundant polar functional groups (-CHO and -C(sic)N), as a functional artificial interface layer, are rationally designed to optimize electrolyte/Zn interfaces with large-scale viability. Of particular note, the quantum-sized CDs with strong Zn affinity can effectively ameliorate the electric field distribution and ensure that more Zn2+ is adsorbed onto the whole electrode, which are beneficial for lowering the barrier of Zn2+ nucleation and inducing homogeneous Zn deposition, thus rendering a dendrite-free Zn anode, as extensively confirmed by in situ optical microscope observation and finite element simulation. Meanwhile, the dense and insoluble coating layer with abundant polar functional groups is conducive to arousing the repulsion effect, which is good for shielding the active water and SO42-, thus eliminating the water-mediated parasitic reactions and improving Zn2+ reaction kinetics. More importantly, the electrochemically stable CDs layer endows the Zn anode with a prolonged lifespan of 3000 h at 1 mA cm(-2). This feasible and efficient fabrication of functional CDs layer opens a new avenue for stable dendrite-free metal anodes.

Herein, a unique ionene oligomer is synthesized from 1,4-Diazabicyclo [2.2.2] octane (DABCO) and diethylene glycol bis(2-chloroethyl)ether having bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI-) as the anion (PO3TFSI, where, "P' indicates the oligomer and "O3 ' denotes the 3 oxyethylene units). The ASSPE was fabricated by a straightforward viable procedure involving uniaxial electrospinning of poly (acrylonitrile) (PAN) blended with PO3TFSI and doped with lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt (LiTFSI). The prepared electrospun (PAN/PO3TFSI/LiTFSI) ASSPE presented an intriguing morphology following heat-treatment like the venation found on a leaf blade where the network of veins is responsible for providing support to the entire lamina. The final structure consists of a PAN framework with the ionene oligomer flowing out of and around the fibers, closing the pores of the nanofibrous mat in the process. The ASSPE having such leaf blade inspired veined morphology with closed pores exhibits a high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 1.01 x 10(-3) S cm(-1), an electrochemical stability window of ~& nbsp;4.6 V, and outstanding thermal stability. The solid-state Li/LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries assembled with the (PAN/PO3TFSI/LiTFSI) ASSPE showed good Coulombic efficiency above 98% when cycled at 0.2C for 100 cycles at both 25 ?C and 60 ?C. Furthermore, the ASSPE showed potential application in all-solid-state lithium sulfur battery. Additionally, a flexible Li/ASSPE/LFP custom made cell was demonstrated to work even in extremely deformed conditions, such as being folded, crimped and rolled, indicating the high flexibility of the fiber based solid electrolyte.

To promote the real applications, Na4MnV(PO4)(3) (NMVP) with low cost and high energy density is highly recommended by partial substitution of V with earth-abundant active element Mn. Nevertheless, NMVP still encounters the problems of poor electrical conductivity and fair reversibility of Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple, resulting in unsatisfactory cycling stability. Herein, carbon-encapsulated NMVP nanoroads are synthesized by a facile solid-state reaction in molten hydrocarbon media. The synergistic effects of carbon encapsulation and nanoengineering enable high electronic conductivity and large electrolyte-accessible surface areas of NMVP/C cathode, as well as highly reversible phase transitions upon repeated Na+ insertion/extraction. Thus, the NMVP/C nanoroads deliver excellent electrochemical performances, including high reversible capacity (112.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.02 A g(-1)), excellent rate capability (58.3 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)), and good cycling stability (85.1% of capacity retention over 1200 cycles at 1 A g(-1)). Moreover, the storage mechanism of Na+ is investigated by ex situ X-ray diffraction, and the fast ionic/electronic transport kinetics are revealed by combining electrochemical methods with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Li2S is a promising cathode material for Li-S batteries, but it must be mixed with a conductive substrate owing to its insulating properties. We prepared Li2S/C composites using commercially available carbon-based materials as carbon hosts and agents for the reduction of a Li2SO4 precursor to Li2S. Intimate contact between the Li2S/C composite constituents was achieved in situ with the additional carbon based material. The specific surface area of the carbon-based precursor affected the electrochemical performance of the Li2S/C composite. Using a sparingly solvating electrolyte enabled highly reversible electrochemical graphite intercalation and suppressed the polysulfide shuttling effect owing to a reduction in lithium polysulfide intermediate solubility. The graphite-Li2S full cell exhibited high Coulombic efficiency and stable long-term cycling performance.

Herein, a facile and versatile sol-gel fabrication strategy followed by heat treatment is developed to synthesize Na4Fe3(PO4)(2)(P2O7)@NaFePO4@C core-double-shell architectures grown on flexible carbon cloth, which can be directly used as a binder-free cathode for high-performance sodium ion batteries. In the composite structure, the thickness of the maricite NaFePO4 shell can be stably confined to approximately 15 nm, which effectively promotes its electrochemical activation to achieve a high reversible capacity. The Na4Fe3(PO4)(2)(P2O7) core possesses a high working voltage and fast ion transport capability, while the carbon cloth and outermost carbon shell jointly build a fast three-dimensional electronic conducting network. In combination with structural and compositional advantages, the Na4Fe3(PO4)(2)(P2O7)@NaFePO4@C-carbon cloth cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity (136 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C), excellent cycling stability (without capacity decay over 3000 cycles at 10C), and good rate capability (68 mAh g(-1) at 100C). This work provides a new and effective strategy to achieve synergism between Na4Fe3(PO4)(2)(P2O7) and NaFePO4 for realizing superior electrochemical performance on flexible substrates.

Based on the survival data, Lewis lung carcinoma cells were verified to be more radiosensitive to the carbon ion beam than to the X-ray irradiation. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) value, which was up to 1.77 at 10% survival level, showed that the DNA damage induced by the high-LET carbon ion beam was more remarkable than that induced by the low-LET X-ray irradiation. The dose response curves of '' Tail DNA (%)'' (TD) and "Olive tail moment" (OTM) for the carbon ion irradiation showed saturation beyond about 8 Gy. This behavior was not found in the X-ray curves. Additionally, the carbon ion beam produced a lower survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) value and a higher initial Olive tail moment 2 Gy (OTM2) than those for the X-ray irradiation. These results suggest that carbon ion beams having high-LET values produced more severe cell reproductive death and DNA damage in Lewis lung carcinoma cells in comparison with X-rays and comet assay might be an effective predictive test even combining with clonogenic assay to assess cellular radio sensitivity.

Relationship between Carbon Isotope Discrimination and Mineral Content in Wheat Grown under Three Different Water Regimes	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						ash content; bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); carbon isotope discrimination; drought; mineral content	DRY-MATTER PRODUCTION; LEAF ASH CONTENT; GRAIN-YIELD; USE EFFICIENCY; DURUM-WHEAT; BREAD WHEAT; POTASSIUM; GENOTYPES; SILICON; ACCUMULATION	Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) has been proposed as an indirect selection criterion for transpiration efficiency and grain yield in wheat. However, because of the high cost for Delta analysis, attempts have been carried out to identify alternative screening criteria. Ash content (m(a)) has been proposed as an alternative criterion for Delta in wheat and barley. A pot experiment was conducted to analyse the relationship between Delta and m(a) in flag leaf and grain. Plants of 10 genotypes were cultivated under three different water regimes corresponding to moderate, intermediate and severe drought stress obtained by maintaining soil humidity at 75 %, 55 % and 45 % of the humidity at field capacity, respectively. Delta and m(a) in flag leaf and grain showed significant differences between the moderate, intermediate and severe drought stress levels. Significant correlations were found among genotypes for Delta and m(a) in flag leaf under severe drought stress, and for Delta and m(a) in grain under intermediate and moderate drought stress. In flag leaf at anthesis, Delta was negatively associated to K content and positively to Mg content. At maturity, Delta in grain was negatively correlated with Mg and Ca contents in flag leaf and grain, respectively. These results suggested that these traits may be potentially useful traits, which could be surrogates for Delta.	[Xu, X.] Ningxia Univ, Yinchuan 750021, Peoples R China; [Zhu, L.; Liang, Z.

However, the interaction dynamics between C3N4 and a sensitized dye has not been reported in the literature. Herein, we selected four commonly used xanthene dyes such as fluorescein, dibromofluorescein, eosin Y, and erythrosine B and prepared their corresponding dye-sensitized-C3N4 composites. For the first time, we derived the electron transfer rate from the LUMO of each photoexcited xanthene dye to the conduction band of C3N4 using picoesecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements. We also obtained the reduction potentials of all selected xanthene dyes and C3N4 with cyclic voltammetry measurements. The cyclic voltammetry measurements gave a consistent result with the picosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements. Besides, the possibility of the selected xanthene dye as an acceptor for the hole of the photoexcited C3N4 was also discussed. We believe this study is significant for the researcher to understanding the fundamental aspects in the xanthene dye-sensitized-C3N4 photocatalytic systems.

Building on the immense research on cathode optimization from Li-S batteries, for the first time a beneficial role of MXenes for Mg-S batteries is reported. Through a facile, low-temperature vacuum-filtration technique, several novel current collector- and binder-free cathode films were developed, with either dipenthamethylene thiuram tetrasulfide (PMTT) or S-8 nanoparticles as the source of redox-active sulfur. The importance of combining MXene with a high surface area co-host material, such as carbon nanotubes, was demonstrated. A positive effect of MXenes on the average voltage and reduced self-discharge was also discovered. Ascribed to the rich polar surface chemistry of Ti3C2Tx MXene, an almost doubling of the discharge capacity (530 vs. 290 mA h g(-1)) was achieved by using MXene as a polysulfide-confining interlayer, obtaining a capacity retention of 83 % after 25 cycles.

However, little is known about economic parameters and carbon footprint (CF, defined as total greenhouse gases emission from the whole life cycle perspective) of intensive wheat (Trilicum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping production under different integrated strategies of straw-return and tillage. To quantify the differences of straw-return and tillage integrated strategies in economic parameters and carbon sustainability, a field experiment was established in 2008 in which six integrated strategies were evaluated: straw return of both maize and wheat (MR-WR), MR-WR with subsoiling to similar to 40 cm depth after maize harvest (MS-WR), single straw return of wheat (MN-WR), single straw return of maize (MR-WN), MR-WN with subsoiling to similar to 40 cm depth after maize harvest (MS-WN) and no straw return (MN-WN). Results showed that the MS-WR had the greatest grain yields of both wheat and maize, gross revenue and economic profit with increases of 45.5%, 35.6%, 26.5%, and 79.7% relative to the MN-WN, respectively. Compared with the initial SOC level, the SOC stock increased by 22.9% under MS-WR, following by MR-WR (16.0%), MS-WN (11.6%), MR-WN (8.0%), MN-WR (5.1%), and MN-WN (-3.8%). The MS-WR reduced the net CF and net CF per economic profit by 35.4% and 64.1% relative to the MN-WN although it elevated the CF by 25.3%. Therefore, adopting the integrated strategies of both maize and wheat straw return with subsoiling to similar to 40cm depth after maize harvest represented an economically and C-friendly optimal field management practice for intensive wheat-maize double cropping production in the Guanzhong Plain or other regions with similar environmental conditions in the world.

Individual carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as one of the strongest materials. However, macroscopic CNT fibers usually have breaking strength far below that of individual CNTs. In this work, by mimicking the structure of natural silk fibers, strong and stiff CNT fibers are prepared by infiltrating silk fibroin (SF) into CNT fibers. There are abundant hydrogen bonds in SF, contributing to the enhanced interactions between neighboring CNTs. Glycerol is selected to promote the formation of beta-sheet conformation in SF, leading to further enhanced strength and modulus. Remarkably, the SF infiltrated CNT fibers show breaking strength of 1023 MPa, toughness of 10.3 MJ m(-3), and Young's modulus of 81.3 GPa, which are 250%, 132%, and 442% of the pristine CNT fibers. The structure of the SF and the interactions between CNTs and SF are studied via Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation. Mimicking the hierarchical structures of natural silk fibers and enhance the interfacial load transfer by infiltrating SF are effective for reinforcing CNT fibers, which may be useful in the design and preparation of other structural materials.

Because Se is physically encapsulated and chemically bonded by carbon, the shuttle reaction of polyselenide is effectively mitigated. The in situ formed C/Se composites exhibit superior cycling stability for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries in carbonate-based electrolytes. The reversible capacity of the in situ formed C/Se composites is maintained at 430 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles in Li-ion batteries and 280 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles in Na-ion batteries at a current density of 100 mA g(-1).

An embedded element approach is used to simplify mesh generation for the matrix phase. This approach is shown to yield errors of 1% compared with a more conventional unstructured mesh, whilst offering significant reductions in model size. Periodic boundary conditions are adopted, applying Saint-Venant's principle to provide an approximation of the effective material properties within an inner RVE region, some distance away from the outer boundary of the model. The critical decay length of prescribing such boundary conditions is shown to be approximately two times the fibre length in all cases, when a heterogeneous material (rather than homogeneous material) is used to model the outer region.

J	Li, ZQ; Yin, LW				Li, Zhaoqiang; Yin, Longwei			MOF-derived, N-doped, hierarchically porous carbon sponges as immobilizers to confine selenium as cathodes for Li-Se batteries with superior storage capacity and perfect cycling stability	NANOSCALE			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; ION BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; COORDINATION POLYMER; DIRECT CARBONIZATION; NANOPOROUS CARBON; ELECTROLYTE; FRAMEWORKS; COMPOSITE	Nitrogen-doped carbon sponges (NCS) composed of hierarchical microporous carbon layers are derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs) via carbonization at high temperatures under Ar and NH3 flow. Se is impregnated into 0.4-0.55 nm micropores by melting-diffusion and infiltration methods. The confinement of Se within small-sized micropores of NCS efficiently prevents Se loss, and mesopores between carbon layers absorb a sufficient amount of electrolyte, as well as serve as cushion spaces for large volume changes during delithiation-lithiation processes. Nitrogen doping improves the electrical conductivity of carbon matrix and facilitates rapid charge transfer, making the carbon sponge a highway for charges involved in redox reactions. When serving as cathode materials for Li-Se batteries, the NCS/Se-50 composite with 50 wt% Se exhibits excellent cycling stability, superior rate capability and high coulombic efficiency. The cathode can exhibit 443.2 mA h g(-1) at the 200th cycle with a coulombic efficiency of up to 99.9% at 0.5C (C = 675 mA h g-1), which leads to 0.031% capacity loss per cycle from 5th to 200th cycles. Even at a high rate of 5C, it can still retain 286.6 mA h g(-1). The unique, large surface rod-like MOF-derived, N-doped carbon sponges with hierarchical porosity could be potential candidates in the related energy-storage systems.

Herein, we report a reproducible method for coupling Pt nanoparticles and WC hybrids (Pt-WC) based on bimetallic Zn-Co-ZIFs (BMZ) for the first time by facile impregnation-pyrolyzation method. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Pt and WC metal nanoparticles, the optimized catalyst Pt-WC-1,10/BMZ (the molar ratio of Zn/Co is 1:2) with ony 0.91 wt% Pt loading exhibits prominent electrochemical performance. As cathode catalyst in 0.5M H2SO4 for water splitting, Pt-WC-1,10/BMZ exhibits high current density (eta(10) = 23 mV) superior to 20% Pt/C (eta(10) = 33 mV) and long stability at least 3000 cyclic voltammetry cycles and 8 h for chronopotentiometry test. At -33 mV, the Pt mass activity of Pt-WC-1,10/BMZ is 37.7 times higher than 20% Pt/C. The outstanding stability is attributed to metal particles-fixed in porous carbon structure.

Self-assembly of biomorphic carbon/sulfur microstructures in sulfidic environments	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; HYDROGEN-SULFIDE; SULFUR; BIOMINERALIZATION; MICROFOSSILS; BACTERIA; OXIDATION; OXYGEN; COMPOSITES; MICROSCOPY	In natural and laboratory-based environments experiencing sustained counter fluxes of sulfide and oxidants, elemental sulfur (S-0)-a key intermediate in the sulfur cycle-can commonly accumulate. S-0 is frequently invoked as a biomineralization product generated by enzymatic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide and polysulfides. Here we show the formation of S-0 encapsulated in nanometre to micrometre-scale tubular and spherical organic structures that self-assemble in sulfide gradient environments in the absence of any direct biological activity. The morphology and composition of these carbon/sulfur microstructures so closely resemble microbial cellular and extracellular structures that new caution must be applied to the interpretation of putative microbial biosignatures in the fossil record. These reactions between sulfide and organic matter have important implications for our understanding of S-0 mineralization processes and sulfur interactions with organic carbon in the environment. They furthermore provide a new pathway for the synthesis of carbon-sulfur nanocomposites for energy storage technologies.

Densification of Ionic Liquid Molecules within a Hierarchical Nanoporous Carbon Structure Revealed by Small-Angle Scattering and Molecular Dynamics Simulation	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article						room temperature ionic liquid; mesoporous carbon; energy storage; interfacial structure; nanoconfinement	ALKYL CHAIN-LENGTH; X-RAY-SCATTERING; NITROGEN ADSORPTION; NANOSTRUCTURED MATERIALS; RESORCINOL-FORMALDEHYDE; ATOMISTIC SIMULATION; MESOPOROUS CARBONS; POROUS MATERIALS; DOUBLE-LAYER; FORCE-FIELD	The molecular-scale properties of the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, [C(4)mim(+)] [Tf2N-], confined in nanometer-scale carbon pores have been investigated using small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering and fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. [C(4)mim(+)] [Tf2N-] densities significantly higher than that of the bulk fluid at the same temperature and pressure result from the strong affinity of the RTIL cation with the carbon surface during the initial filling of slitlike, subnanometer micropores along the mesopore surfaces. Subsequent filling of cylindrical similar to 8 nm mesopores in the mesoporous carbon matrix is accompanied by weak RTIL densification. The relative size of the micropores compared to the ion dimension, and the strong interaction between the RTIL and the slit-like micropore, disrupt the bulk RTIL structure. This results in a low-excluded volume, high-RTIL ion density configuration. The observed interfacial phenomena are simulated using a molecular dynamics model consisting of a linear combination of mesopore and micropore effects. These observations highlight the importance of including the effects of a porous substrate's internal surface morphology, especially roughness and microporosity, on the resulting electrolyte structural properties and performance in electrical energy storage applications.

Many photocatalysts based on semiconductor oxide have been reported. Although they have excellent catalytic activity under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, it is difficult to practical application because of the limited ratio of UV light in whole solar irradiation. In this work, we prepared solar driven photocatalyst based on graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) by simple photo-reduction reaction. In the synthesized process, GQDs were served as reducing agent for Ag cations and capping agent for the in situ formation of Ag NPs with small size. Although the used concentration of Ag cations was very low (just 0.54 mg/ml), GQDs-Ag photocatalyst exhibited a high efficiency for photo degradation Rhodamine B under sunlight. It could be ascribed to the synthetic role of Ag NPs and GQDs, and further the detailed photocatalytic mechanism was analyzed in this paper. Because this kind of photocatalyst made from water solution and can be driven by sunlight, it is a promising photocatalyst for industrial applications in the environmental remediation field.

Here, a high-performance cathode material by confining 70 wt% of SeS2 in a highly ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) framework with a polydopamine (PDA) protection sheath for novel Li-Se/S batteries is reported. With a relatively high SeS2 mass loading of 2.6-3 mg cm(-2), the CMK-3/SeS2@PDA cathode exhibits a high capacity of >1200 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), excellent C-rate capability of 535 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1), and prolonged life over 500 cycles. Benefitting from the unique advantages of SeS2 and the rationally designed host framework, this new cathode material demonstrates a feasible strategy to overcome the bottlenecks of current Li-S systems for high energy density rechargeable batteries.

Four kinds composites with different compositions were produced, and the mechanical properties and electrical wear performance were investigated. The results showed that the composite added with carbon nanotubes had a higher hardness and strength, a lower contact voltage drop and an excellent anti-wear property in electrical sliding wear, because of the reinforcement ability of carbon nanotubes. Adding graphite to the composite also decreased the wear loss and contact voltage drop, because graphite had an electrical current conducting ability which not only made the current pass the lubricating films easily but also eliminated and reduced the arc and spark effectively.

The crystalline carbons exhibit poor insertion capability of large Na+/K+ ions, which limits the storage capability of Na/K batteries. Herein, porous S and N co-doped thin carbon (S/N@C) with shell-like (shell size approximate to 20-30 nm, shell wall approximate to 8-10 nm) morphology for enhanced Na+/K+ storage is presented. Thanks to the hollow structure and thin shell-wall, S/N@C exhibits an excellent Na+/K+ storage capability with fast mass transport at higher current densities, leading to limited compromise over charge storage at high charge/discharge rates. The S/N@C delivers a high reversible capacity of 448 mAh g(-1) for Na battery, at the current density of 100 mA g(-1) and maintains a discharge capacity up to 337 mAh g(-1) at 1000 mA g(-1). Owing to shortened diffusion pathways, S/N@C delivers an unprecedented discharge capacity of 204 and 169 mAh g(-1) at extremely high current densities of 16 000 and 32 000 mA g(-1), respectively, with excellent reversible capacity for 4500 cycles. Moreover, S/N@C exhibits high K+ storage capability (320 mAh g(-1) at current density of 50 mA g(-1)) and excellent cyclic life.

Research in nanobiotechnology-based therapeutic alternatives has provided innovative and promising strategies to overcome MDR. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the new strategy of a co-loaded reversal agent and chemotherapeutic drug with shortened carbon nanotubes (CNTs) would show useful effects on the real-time reversal of tumor MDR. CNTs were cut and purified via ultrasonication and oxidative acid treatment to optimize their length for drug-delivery vehicles, then verapamil (Ver) and doxorubicin (Dox) were co-loaded on shortened CNTs (denoted as Ver/Dox/shortened CNTs), which acted as a drug delivery system. The multidrug resistant leukemia K562/A02 cells were treated with the denoted Ver/Dox/shortened CNTs. The real-time reversal of tumor MDR were evaluated by flow cytometer, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, and Western blot analysis. In the same MDR tumor cells the new strategy of a co-loaded reversal agent and chemotherapeutic drug with CNTs could inhibit the function of P-glycoprotein in real-time by Ver as reversal agent, significantly increase the uptake of Dox, enhance the sensitivity of the MDR cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent, and induce apoptosis. It was therefore concluded that a co-loaded reversal agent and chemotherapeutic drug with shortened CNTs could have real-time reversal ability of MDR in tumors, which could represent a promising approach in cancer therapy.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the MIP-CMSs. The adsorption isotherm and kinetics of DBT on MIP-CMSs were investigated. The preliminary results show that MIP-CMSs possessed good recognition toward DBT, that is, the adsorption equilibrium time was about 5 h and the equilibrium adsorption amount was 0.595 mmol/g. The mechanism for adsorption of DBT onto MIP-CMSs was found to follow Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Designing host materials for sulfur cathodesneeds particular attention in both physical confinement and surfacechemistry. Herein, the Co, N codoped"wire in tube"carbonfiber(WIT-Co) is rationally fabricated and serves as the sulfur host.Benefiting from the synergistic effects of excellent LiPS absorptionand electrocatalysis capability, the WIT-Co/S cathode reveals ahigh initial capacity of 1462 mAh g-1at 0.1 C and stable cyclingperformance of 650 mAh g-1at 2.0 C after 400 cycles with a low-capacity decay of 0.021% per cycle. Notably, even with the highsulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm-2and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 mu Lmg-1, the WIT-Co/S electrode still exhibits an excellent arealcapacity of 4.8 mAh cm-2at 0.2 C after 100 cycles. This work provides a superior structure of the sulfur host, which not onlyaccelerates the conversion of LiPSs but also alleviates the shuttle effect, therefore facilitating the practical application of Li-Sbatteries.

PMMA was coated on CNTs by microemulsion polymerization, and then laccase was immobilized on the PMMA-CNTs. Laccase immobilized on PMMA-CNTs shows a high catalytic ability and stable reusability. The immobilized laccase exhibits a high specific laccase activity and a high decolorization rate on the azo dyes, which the maximum decolorization rate for MB can reach 96% and maximum decolorization rate for OH is 74%. Additionally, the decolorization rate was decreased only about 10% after 10 successive cycles. The immobilized laccase can be a promising multifunction material in wastewater treatment, which would be applied in the decolorization of azo dyes.

Mechanical properties and strain hardening behavior of aluminum matrix composites reinforced with few-walled carbon nanotubes	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Metal matrix composites (MMCs); Carbon nanotubes (CNTs); Strength; Ductility; Strain hardening	METAL; NANOCOMPOSITES; DISPERSION; PROGRESS; STATE	In this study, for the first time few-walled carbon nanotubes (FWCNTs) with similar to 3 walls were used as reinforcements in fabricating high performance aluminum matrix composites (AMCs). FWCNTs/Al composites and referential Al materials were prepared by a powder metallurgy route consisting of high energy ball milling, spark plasma sintering (SPS) and subsequent hot extrusion. It is found that, by decreasing SPS temperature and time, FWCNTs/Al composites showed reduced grains with an increased dislocation density and improved structural integrity of FWCNTs, leading to an increased tensile strength. Meanwhile, comparatively high strain hardening rates and long strain softening behavior were observed after necking in the sample sintered at 500 degrees C, which resulted in a tensile elongation of 11.7% with a high yield strength of 382 MPa. The experimental results suggested that, compared with traditional multi-walled carbon nano-tubes (MWCNTs), FWCNTs showed a noticeably enhanced strengthening effect and provided a good balance of strength and ductility in Al composites. It may make FWCNTs a good reinforcement candidate for metal matrix composites to achieve improved mechanical properties. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Chen, B.; Li, Z.; Li, J.

In the present work, we reported the design and preparation of nitrogen and phosphorus dual-doped carbon nanosheet (NPCNS) through direct pyrolysis of supramolecular aggregates that resulted from the cross-linking reaction between nitrogen bio-functional groups of chitosan and phosphoric groups of physic acid. The resultant NPCNS catalysts exhibited very high electrochemical ORR activity and selectivity toward H2O2 production in alkaline medium due to the unique 2D nanostructure and the synergistic effect between nitrogen and phosphorus dopant. High practical H2O2 production rate of 223.4 mmol g(catalyst)(-1) h(-1) with high faradaic efficiency of 80% could be also achieved in home-made H-cell, indicating the potential applications of H2O2 in the waste water treatment, pulp and paper industry.

Herein, hierarchical N-doped carbon network wrapped Fe3Se4 nanoparticles (Fe3Se4 @NC@CNTs) has been successfully fabricated by a facile freezedrying method followed by in situ selenization process. The macroporous with a diameter of about 200 nm uniformly distributed into the hierarchical carbon network, guaranteeing favorable electronic conductivity as well as structural stability. When utilized as anodes for sodium ion batteries, the Fe3Se4 @NC@CNTs exhibit a capacity of 440 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) (based on the total mass of the composite). Even cycling at 500 mA g(-1) for 1000 cycles, the electrode still remains 311 mAh g(-1). In addition, the Fe3Se4 @NC@CNTs also shows excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performance (an overpotential of 167 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1)). The superior electrochemical performance of the Fe3Se4 @NC@CNTs could be ascribed to the unique hierarchical network and uniform porous structure, which accommodates the volume changes of inner Fe3Se4, accelerates the ions/electrons transportation and facilitates electrolyte penetration. These results may give insights for the rational design of advanced electrode materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ni/CNT achieved the lowest H-2 yields but produced consistent carbon gasification efficiencies (CGEs) similar to 80% during 48 h of operation at steady state, whereas the CGEs from Ni/alpha-Al2O3 and Ni/MgAl2O4-Al2O3 decreased to < 80% when the gasification was extended to 48 h. Characterization results indicated that CNTs showed stable pore structures and Ni/CNT showed the best dissolution resistance of Ni in SCW. Persistent loss of Al into SCW probably contributed to the deactivation of Al2O3-supported Ni catalyst beds. Results also suggest that enhanced interaction of Ni and the supports may be beneficial for reducing dissolution of Ni in SCW.

However, growth of lithium dendrites, shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides intermediates and unstable interphase of high-voltage intercalation-type cathodes largely prevent their practical deployment. Herein, to fully conquer the three challenges via one strategy, a novel electrolyte with highly coordinated solvation structure-in-nonsolvent is designed. On account of the particular electrolyte structure, the shuttle effect is completely suppressed by quasi-solid conversion of S species in Li-S batteries, with a stable cycle performance even at lean electrolyte (5 lL mg(-1)). Simultaneously, in-situ-formed highly-fluorinated interphases can not only lower Li+ diffusion barrier to ensure uniform nucleation of Li but also improve stability of NCM cathodes, which enable excellent capacity retention of Li parallel to LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 batteries under conditions toward practical applications (high loading of 2.7 mAh cm(-2) and lean electrolyte of 5 mL Ah(-1)).

The main challenge to develop Li-Te battery systems is to explore an ideal substrate for Te accommodation. Here we have designed and exploited a "muscle" structured electrode, which enables an excellent electrochemical performance. Te is confined in the hollow carbon cell as "tissue cell" and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are induced as "blood capillary". Such an interesting design possesses multifold advantages. Specifically, many hollow carbon cells not only offer large void space for loading Te, giving rise to high mass loading of active materials, but also manifest a good contact between Te and carbon. In addition, the introduction of CNTs provides abundant channels along CNTs in the composites for both electron and ion transport upon cycling, yielding high discharge capacity. With this desired design, muscle-like electrode shows a high specific capacity of similar to 240 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles. This work would offer new ideas for developing other exceptional electrodes for energy storage applications.

The polymeric shell consisting primarily of crosslinked rubber and loosely bound rubber could be selectively separated by varying the extrusion temperature to 260, 280 and 300 degrees C. The structure, chemical composition and structure of the separated CBlp were characterized using thermo-gravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The crosslinked structure was persevered in the rubber shell of CBlp after extruding at 260 degrees C. A layer of loosely bound rubber was observed only in the rubber shell when extruded at 280 degrees C and 300 degrees C. The composition of the bound rubber layer is also dependent on the processing temperature. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The V2O3 adsorbs polysulfides and catalytically promotes polysulfide trapping, while the CNFs provide conductive channels that facilitate ion transport and accelerate reaction kinetics. The electrochemical performance of the resulting Na-S cells are superior to those of cells with a CNF interlayer and without an interlayer. A cell with a V2O3 @CNF interlayer utilizes almost 70% of its active material at 0.1C, while cells with a CNF interlayer and without an interlayer utilize 54 and 33%, respectively. It demonstrates superior rate performance, achieving a capacity of 268 mA h g(-1) at 2.0C, and its diffusion coefficient (-10(-11)cm(2) s(-1)) is an order of magnitude higher than those of cells with a CNF interlayer or without an interlayer (-10(-12) cm(2) s(-1)), indicating fast reaction kinetics. Moreover, it delivers a discharge capacity of 406 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0C with a high coulombic efficiency of 100%. Even at a high C-rate of 2.0C, the capacity of the cell decays at a low rate of 0.076% per cycle over 1000 cycles, indicating exceptional capacity retention. The outstanding electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the effective sodium polysulfide confinement, improved active material utilization, and accelerated reaction kinetics associated with the V2O3 @CNF interlayer.

However, the volume changes dramatically during the discharge/charging process, resulting in a rapid decrease in capacity and poor electrochemical performance. Introducing a sulfur vacancy structure into the marcasite (FeS2) anode would be a great help for its electron fast transport, thereby promoting the electrochemical performance of LIBs. Herein, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, these problems were alleviated through FeS2 nanoparticles that were synthesized using the biomolecule L-cysteine as the sulfur source along with the reduction process of GO to rGO sheets by NaBH4, forming an intriguing S-vacancy 3D FeS2/rGO (FSG) composite. S-vacancy FeS2 nanoparticles, with an average size of 100 nm, were formed on the surface of rGO sheets homogeneously. As an anode material for LIBs, the FSG electrode delivers a higher rate capability of 410 mA h g???1 at 5 C (1 C = 900 mA g???1) and a better cyclability of 826 mA h g???1 after 150 cycles at 0.2 C compared to pure FeS2. By DFT calculations and systematic characterization, we show that S-vacancies can modulate the surface electronic structure, thereby enhancing the binding energy and charge-transfer rate of FSG composites. We found that the superior performance of FSG anode materials is due to their prominent 3-D and S-vacancy structures. The FSG composite materials for charge storage promote the reversibility of the conversion reaction. The Li???S bonds break and form ceaselessly, which is why the crystallographic structure is destructed. The results demonstrate that a simple feasible method to construct composites with an S-vacancy structure and high-performance anodes for LIBs could be designed.

The results show that the rCF possesses crystal structure and tensile strength comparable with those of virgin CF (vCF) exception of pyrolytic char adhering to the surface of rCF after pyrolysis. The rCF was converted into C/C composites through impregnation-pyrolysis. Pyrolytic char was found to have no evident negative effect on the densification rates of the rCF C/C composites. By reactive melt infiltration, the rCF C/C-SiC composites were fabricated based upon the rCF C/C composites. The achieved rCF C/C-SiC composites do not differ markedly from the vCF group control in terms of microstructure and bending strength. Furthermore, the thermal diffusion coefficients of the rCF C/C-SiC composites are very close to those of vCF C/C-SiC composites in the temperature range 25 degrees C-300 degrees C. The coefficient of friction values of the rCF C/CSiC composites are as stable as those of vCF control group, both being maintained at approximately 0.4 during friction test, whether at 25 degrees C or 300 degrees C. The wear rate of the rCF C/C-SiC composites is 3.8 mu m.min(-1), nearly indistinguishable from that of the vCF C/C-SiC composites, i.e., 4.5 mu m.min(-1), further suggesting that the two materials resemble each other closely. The rCF C/C-SiC composites exhibit great potential for use as alternative brake pads to serve auto braking systems. This work opens up a new path for high-value reuse of rCF.

In this study, thermally modified activated carbon (AC600) was applied to activate PAA to degrade sulfamethoxazole (SMX). And the effect of groundwater pH, chloride ion (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), sulfate ion (SO42-), and natural organic matter (NOM) on SMX removal by AC600/PAA process was studied in detail. PAA could be effectively activated by AC600. Increasing AC600 dose (10-100mg/L) or PAA dosages (0.065-0.39 mM) generally enhanced the SMX removal, the excellent performance in SMX removal was achieved at 50 mg/L AC600 and 0.26 mM PAA. The removal of SMX was well described by second-order kinetic, with the rate constant (k(obs)) of 10.79 M1s(-1),both much greater than the removal constants of PAA alone (0.034 M1s(-1))and AC600 alone (1.774 M1s(-1)).R-O.(CH3C(O)OO., CH3C(O) O.) and electron-transfer process were proved to be responsible for the removal of SMX while HO. and O-1(2) made little to no contribution to the novel PAA/AC600 system, which differs from typical advanced oxidation processes. The SMX can be removed effectively over a wide pH range (3-9), exhibiting a remarkable pH-tolerant performance. Sulfate ion (SO42-), dissolved oxygen (DO), NOM displayed negligible influence on the SMX removal. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) exerted an inhibitory effect on SMX abatement, while chloride ion (Cl-) promoted the removal of SMX. This showed excellent anti-interference capacity and satisfactory decontamination performance under actual groundwater conditions. Furthermore, the degradation pathways of SMX were proposed, there was no obvious difference in the acute toxicity of the mixed products during the degradation process. It will facilitate further research of metal-free catalyst/PAA system as a new strategy for groundwater in situ remediation technology.

The results indicate that the samples were MWCNTs that were about 30 nm in external diameter, about 15 nm in inner diameter. The ferrocene dosage had an obvious effect on the morphology, degree of graphitization, and magnetic property of the MWCNTs. The growth mechanism of the MWCNTs in the gaseous detonation process was discussed using the detonation Zeldovich-von Neumann-Doring model and a vapor-liquid-solid growth model. The minimum reflection loss of the MWCNTs was -6.1 dB at 11.2 GHz with a thickness of 2 mm, which is lower than that of the MWCNTs prepared via other methods, and the reasons for this result are analyzed in the paper.

J	Sun, WL; Xia, J; Li, S; Sun, F				Sun, Wei-Ling; Xia, Jing; Li, Si; Sun, Fang			Effect of natural organic matter (NOM) on Cu(II) adsorption by multi-walled carbon nanotubes: Relationship with NOM properties	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Natural organic matter; Cu(II); Multi-walled carbon nanotubes; Adsorption	HUMIC-ACID; FULVIC-ACID; WATER; SURFACE; SOIL; ENVIRONMENT; COPPER(II); BEHAVIOR; NANOPARTICLES; AROMATICITY	The effect of natural organic matter (NOM) on Cu(II) adsorption by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was investigated. Particular attention was paid to the relationship between NOM properties and NOM adsorption and their effects on the Cu(II) adsorption by MWCNTs. The results showed that the NOM adsorption data were well fit to the Freundlich isotherm model, and the MWCNTs that had higher oxygen content had lower K-F (Freundlich constants) values. The K-F values for the different types of NOM varied greatly and were proportional to the aromatic carbon content, the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 275 nm, and the TOC-normalized fluorescence intensity of the F3 peak at similar to 460 nm. In contrast, they had negative linear correlations with the absorbance ratios at 250 nm and 365 nm and the TOC-normalized fluorescence intensity of the F1 peak from 250 nm to 300 nm. The results indicated that pi-pi and hydrophobic interactions were the predominant NOM adsorption mechanisms by the MWCNTs. The Cu(II) adsorption by the MWCNTs increased with increasing NOM concentrations due to the complexing of Cu(II) with the adsorbed NOM. This was confirmed by XPS and FTIR spectra. The increased degree of Cu(II) adsorption was positively correlated with the carboxyl carbon content, carboxyl group content, and the polarity index of the NOM. The findings in this study highlight that the NOM characteristics are responsible for controlling the NOM adsorption and its effects on heavy metal sorption by MWCNTs. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.

In this work, we study the catalytic conversion of CO 2 to C 1 -C 3 products on boron nanosheet in the presence of compressive strain by using density functional theory. Thermodynamic and microkinetic models are applied to demonstrate the favorable products, critical steps, and hydrogenation mechanisms. As demonstrated, the strain can turn metallic two-dimensional boron nanosheet to semiconductor, not only making boron sheets possess photo(electro)catalytic activity, but also improving energy efficiency and selectivity performance against hydrogen evolution reaction. By introducing the aqueous electrolytes, the hydrated alkali cations not only effect on the CO 2 concentration, but also produce a bigger surface charge density and stronger interfacial electric filed. Especially, the selectivity of C 2 + products is enhanced with the increase of alkali cations size by decreasing the kinetic barrier for CO dimerization and stabilizing the intermediates. The results highlight the significance of metal-free catalysts for CRR by the photoelectrochemical method and provide novel avenues for the development of new solar-energy utilization catalysts.

A major challenge of current SICs is to achieve high rate performance and long-cycle stability of the battery-type anode. Herein, fast sodium storage is achieved from sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) arrays that are uniformly grown on highly conductive carbon nanofiber networks with a high mass loading of 5.6 mg cm(-2). Nanowires and nanobelts of Na2Ti3O7 are both synthesized, and their Na-ion storage properties are compared. Both arrays can be used as binder-free and flexible electrodes, but the nanobelts exhibit higher specific capacity and better rate performance than the nanowires with similar mass loading. The difference between two types of nanostructures is ascribed to their different kinetics in ion/charge transport, according to the electrochemical impedance data. SIC full devices consisting of the Na2Ti3O7 nanobelt anode and biomass-derived porous carbon cathode are constructed, which show pretty high specific energy and power performance.

In principle, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy can expand the resonance window. However, detection of off-resonance SWNTs by SERS remains challenging due to the difficulties in locating the SWNTs exactly at the hot spots with enormous SERS enhancements. Here, polyhedral gold nanocrystals (AuNCs) are in situ prepared on SWNTs for SERS detection via a facile ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method. The fact that the edges of the AuNCs attach to the SWNTs ensures the location of SWNTs perfectly at the SERS hot spots. Consequently, the enormous SERS enhancement enables a maximum enhancement factor of (3.4 +/- 0.6) x 10(4) for an individual SWNT, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the maximum reported in literatures. The detection ratio of SWNTs is also dramatically increased from 33% without SERS to 76% with SERS. The existence of the polyhedral AuNCs suppresses the antenna effects of the SWNTs and allows effective enhancements of the SWNTs under various polarization conditions. The enormous enhancements also enable the detection of several new Raman bands of the SWNTs.

Based on their properties, we used the class I hydrophobin isolated from Grifola frondosa (HGFI) to disperse multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in water. MWCNTs could be effectively dispersed by 30-min sonication in a 0.1 mg/ml HGFI solution. Optical absorption and transmission electron microscopy provide evidence for individually stable dispersed MWCNTs. X-ray photoelectron, Fourier transform infrared, and Raman spectroscopies and thermogravimetric analysis suggest that HGFI can non-covalently bind to MWCNTs through hydrophobic interaction, rendering them hydrophilic. A quartz crystal microbalance and immunological sandwich assay were used to demonstrate that the HGFI-coated MWCNTs can be used to immobilize human immunoglobulin G in solution.

The carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems in East Asia over the last two decades	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							ORGANIC-CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; VEGETATION DYNAMICS; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; MODEL DESCRIPTION; PLANT GEOGRAPHY; CO2 SOURCES; LAND-USE; CHINA	This REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes regional study provides a synthesis of the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in East Asia, a region comprised of China, Japan, North and South Korea, and Mongolia. We estimate the current terrestrial carbon balance of East Asia and its driving mechanisms during 1990-2009 using three different approaches: inventories combined with satellite greenness measurements, terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle models and atmospheric inversion models. The magnitudes of East Asia's terrestrial carbon sink from these three approaches are comparable: -0.293 +/- 0.033 PgC yr(-1) from inventory-remote sensing model-data fusion approach, -0.413 +/- 0.141 PgC yr(-1)(not considering biofuel emissions) or -0.224 +/- 0.141 PgC yr(-1) (considering biofuel emissions) for carbon cycle models, and -0.270 +/- 0.507 PgC yr(-1) for atmospheric inverse models. Here and in the following, the numbers behind +/- signs are standard deviations. The ensemble of ecosystem modeling based analyses further suggests that at the regional scale, climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 together resulted in a carbon sink of -0.289 +/- 0.135 PgC yr(-1), while land-use change and nitrogen deposition had a contribution of -0.013 +/- 0.029 PgC yr(-1) and -0.107 +/- 0.025 PgC yr(-1), respectively. Although the magnitude of climate change effects on the carbon balance varies among different models, all models agree that in response to climate change alone, southern China experienced an increase in carbon storage from 1990 to 2009, while northern East Asia including Mongolia and north China showed a decrease in carbon storage. Overall, our results suggest that about 13-27% of East Asia's CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning have been offset by carbon accumulation in its terrestrial territory over the period from 1990 to 2009. The underlying mechanisms of carbon sink over East Asia still remain largely uncertain, given the diversity and intensity of land management processes, and the regional conjunction of many drivers such as nutrient deposition, climate, atmospheric pollution and CO2 changes, which cannot be considered as independent for their effects on carbon storage.

To advance the utilization of solar energy and achieve zero emission for coal-based power generation more efficiently, a novel direct-fired, oxy-combustion supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle integrated with the solar-driven coal gasification was proposed. In the proposed system, the concentrated solar energy is utilized for coal gasification, and then the produced syngas is combusted with high-purity oxygen to drive a semi-closed supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle with intensive heat recuperation and near-zero carbon emission. Detailed analytical models based on energy and material balance were developed and the overall system thermodynamic performance were determined by the process simulation. Results showed that, at the designate point, the proposed system can save 29.9% of coal consumption and the net system energy efficiency and exergy efficiency soar to 43.4% and 44.6%, respectively; and the annualized coal saving can reach 10.46 kilo tonnes with the annual solar-to-electricity efficiency at 16.9%. The proposed concept may provide a new approach to advancing solar-coal hybridization power generation with near-zero emission.

The effects of GPLs content on the densification route, microstructure feather, mechanical properties, and aging behaviors of such composites were investigated. In spite of the impeding effect of GPLs, high relative density of 98% was achieved for the composites owing to the uniform dispersion of GPLs. The addition of GPLs contributed to enhanced fracture toughness of the composites; when the added content was 1.0 wt.%, its fracture toughness reached up to 8.6 MPa center dot m(1/2). Also, aging behavior of the GPLs/ZrO2 composites was investigated at 134 degrees C for 24 hours. The monolithic ZrO2 ceramic and GPLs/ZrO2 composites presented residual ratio of 55% and 72% in fracture toughness, respectively. Thus, the incorporation of GPLs inhibited phase transformation from tetragonal phase to monoclinic phase of zirconia.

PAC was treated with acidification to increase its surface active points without influence on its surface area. The PAC after acidification was functionalized in the presence of macro-initiators and then grafted with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) in aqueous solution (PAC-PNIPAM). By controlling the grafting degrees of PNIPAM, the synthesized PAC-PNIPAM exhibited different removal efficiency of BPA, the maximum adsorption capacity simulated under Langmuir models reached 247.532 and 116.298 mg/g, respectively. Moreover, the desorption behaviors of BPA also changed significantly from two-stage desorption to minor desorption in water, suggesting the potential application of PAC-PNIPAM in removal of concerned pollutants. Additionally, PAC-PNIPAM showed a good self-flocculation effect, implying that PAC after adsorption could be easily retried and recovered to avoid the secondary pollution of the adsorbent. In all, our work demonstrated potential application of this newly synthesized PAC in water purification and micro-pollutant remediation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main challenge in single molecule SERS is developing reusable plasmonic substrates that ensures single molecule sensitivity and acquires intrinsic information of molecules. Here, we proposed a strategy to utilize single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) to construct SERS substrates. Employing ultrasonic spray pyrolysis, we prepared in situ polyhedral gold nanocrystals closely spaced and attached to nanotubes, ensuring valid hot spots formed along the tube-walls. With such SERS substrates, we proved the single molecule detection by the statistical analysis based on the natural abundance of isotopes. Since SWNTs provide non-chemical bonding adsorption sites, our SERS substrates are easily reusable and have a unique advantage of preserving the intrinsic property of the molecules detected. Using SWNTs to build SERS substrates may become a powerful general strategy in various static and dynamic studies of single molecules.

J	Li, S; Zhang, GJ; Wang, JM; Liu, J; Lv, YK				Li, Sheng; Zhang, Guojie; Wang, Jiming; Liu, Jun; Lv, Yongkang			Enhanced activity of Co catalysts supported on tungsten carbide-activated carbon for CO2 reforming of CH4 to produce syngas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						Dry reforming; Co-based catalysts; Tungsten carbide; Activated carbon; Oxygen vacancy	TRANSITION-METAL CARBIDES; SYNTHESIS GAS; CO/SBA-15 CATALYSTS; BIMETALLIC CATALYST; MODIFIED MOLYBDENUM; METHANE; NI; PERFORMANCE; CEO2; IMPACT	Carbon materials are widely used as catalysts or supports due to their excellent properties. In this paper, the tungsten carbide-activated carbon (WC-AC) composite support was successfully prepared by in-situ carburizing on AC matrix, which is characterized by the covalent anchoring of WC on the AC support. The active metal Co was supported on WC AC for dry reforming of methane (DRM). Samples were analyzed by N-2 physisorption measurements, XRD, XPS, H-2-TPR, H-2-TPD, CH4&CO2-TPSR, TG-DTG. The WC-AC stabilizes the disturbance of C in AC, alleviates the gasification effect of CO2 and increases the active sites for CH4 cracking. Moreover, WC provides a resistance-less bridge suitable for the Co3+ -> Co2+, resulting in a high Co2+/Co3+ ratio on the catalyst surface. This enhances the interaction between the Co species and the WC-AC, thereby enhancing the CH4 activation. In the process of WC-AC promoting Co3+ -> Co2+, the catalyst surface is accompanied by the generation of oxygen vacancies. This can enhance the dissociative adsorption of CO2 on surface of the WC-cobalt oxide, and at the same time increase the relative proportion of adsorbed oxygen on the catalyst surface, thereby effectively inhibiting the formation of coke.

However, the low intrinsic electrical conductivity and the big volume change during charge/discharge cycles result in a poor electrochemical performance. Here, hollow silica spheres embedded in porous carbon (HSS-C) composites are synthesized and investigated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The HSS-C composites demonstrate a high specific capacity of about 910 mA h g(-1) at a rate of 200 mA g(-1) after 150 cycles and exhibit good rate capability. The porous carbon with a large surface area and void space filled both inside and outside of the hollow silica spheres acts as an excellent conductive layer to enhance the overall conductivity of the electrode, shortens the diffusion path length for the transport of lithium ions, and also buffers the volume change accompanied with lithium-ion insertion/extraction processes.

Tensile and fatigue properties of ultrafine-grained low-carbon steel processed by equal channel angular pressing	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING			English	Article						Low-carbon steel; Equal channel angular pressing; Ultrafine grain; Tensile strength; Fatigue strength	SEVERE PLASTIC-DEFORMATION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; REFINEMENT; MICROSTRUCTURE; STRENGTH; CYCLE; 42CRMOVNB; BEHAVIOR; ALLOYS; SIZE	High-strength ultrafine-grained low-carbon steel was processed by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) for different passes and then heat-treated to achieve the tensile strength in the range of 1400-1500 MPa. Then its microstructure and mechanical properties, especially fatigue properties were systemically investigated. It is found that the simultaneous enhancement of tensile strength and elongation can be obtained by only one ECAP pass; the optimum fatigue strength of 460 MPa can be gained by two ECAP passes: while further increasing the number of ECAP passes made the fatigue properties worse. Therefore, combing with the effects of heat treatment and fatigue damage mechanism, it is suggested that few number of ECAP passes is enough to achieve the optimum fatigue properties for low carbon steel, which makes it easy, economical and efficient for the engineering application of ECAP.

Enhanced electrochemical performance of a lead-acid battery by a surface modified negative grid with multiwall carbon nanotube coating	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; ACTIVE MATERIAL; CYCLE-LIFE; CURRENT COLLECTORS; EXPANDER COMPONENTS; ELECTRODE SURFACE; CHARGE; GRAPHENE; CELLS; DISCHARGE	High-performance lead-acid battery (LAB) negative grids have been prepared using a simple carbon nanotube (CNT) coating method. To assess the properties of these materials for use in LAB systems, galvanostatic charging-discharging measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed. The morphology and chemical composition of the CNT coating on the negative grid have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) characterization. The results clearly demonstrate that the CNT coating is uniform and fully covers the negative grid of the LAB, which acts as a CNT adhesion layer (CNTAL) between the current collector and the negative active materials (NAMs), and improves the electrical conductivity. Moreover, an enhanced charge acceptance, and excellent electrochemical performance and cycling stability have been observed for these CNT coated electrodes in comparison to the uncoated electrode. The obtained results reveal that the CNT coating not only reduces the charge transfer resistance but also protects the NAM from irreversible lead sulfation.

Most of pure blue LEDs reported so far, are based on semiconductor quantum dots and metal complex, involving heavy metal elements. Here, the fabrication of O, N co-doped carbon dots (CDs) by a hydrothermal method from perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride and 2,3-diaminophenazine is shown. These CDs show strong photoluminescence (PL) emission peaked at 447 nm (in ethanol) with absolute PL quantum yields of 88.9%. They are then doped into poly(vinyl carbazole) to form the active emission layer in the pure blue CDs LEDs. The electroluminescence emission of these CDs LEDs is centered at 452 nm with Commission Internationale d'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.10). Moreover, the pure blue CDs LEDs show a high external quantum efficiency of 2.114%, high brightness of 648 cd m(-2), long half-lifetime (T-50) of 200 h, and a favorable current efficiency of 2.2 cd A(-1). This work opens a new way to develop cost-effective, environmental-friendly, and high-efficient metal-free pure blue LEDs.

Herein, a bifunctional catalyst, cobalt-chromium phosphide (Co2Cr1-P) merged with a substrate of three-dimensional graphene foam (3DGF), was reported. The Co2Cr1-P@3DGF composite demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic activities for the production of hydrogen and oxygen in 1.0 M KOH, which only requires a low overpotential of 118 and 270 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Additionally, when applying Co2Cr1-P@3DGF as a catalytic electrode for alkaline overall water splitting, the demanded cell voltage at 10 mA cm(-2) is merely 1.56 V. The superior performance is attributable to the incorporation of the Cr element into CoP and the good conductivity of the 3D graphene network substrate.

Inorganic carbon (IC) is their main carbon source. The effects of IC limitation on AOB and AnAOB in the completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite (CANON) process in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) were examined. The optimal IC concentration in the influent was investigated. The start-up time of the CANON process from the activated sludge in the SBBR was 80 d under controlled free ammonia (FA) conditions and sufficient IC source. The AOB and AnAOB activities were limited by an IC concentration of 50 mg-C.L-1 in the influent, whilst the nitrogen loading rate (NLR) was 200 mg-N.L-1.d(-1). The experiment on recovering the influent IC showed that AOB and AnAOB activities were affected by the IC limitation, and not by the pH or FA, at 200 mg-N.L-1.d(-1) NLR and 50 mg-C.L-1 IC in the CANON process. The activities were recovered by increasing the IC concentration in the influent. From an economic point of view, the optimal IC concentration in the influent was 250 mg-C.L-1 at 200 mg-N.L-1.d(-1) NLR in this CANON system.

Based on this improvement, we tested and compared the output pulse limits of this hard-tube MILO with the two cathodes under the same conditions, without an external pumping system after base vacuum pressure was reached. Experimental results reveal that the acceptable pressure for MILO operation is about 1.7 Pa, which is about 100 times higher than the conventional vacuum level (similar to 10(-2) Pa). Moreover, the output pulse limit of this hard-tube MILO has been increased from 7 pluses with polymer velvet cathode to about 127 pulses with carbon fiber array cathode. This promotion in the output pulse limit will speed up the application process of MILO.

The carbon nanotube formation parameter space: data mining and mechanistic understanding for efficient resource use	GREEN CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; TRANSITION-METAL CATALYSTS; ENGINEERED IRON CATALYSTS; FIELD-EMISSION PROPERTIES; LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; FLUIDIZED-BED REACTOR; ALIGNED SINGLE-WALL; DWELL TIME CONTROL; X-RAY-SCATTERING	Carbon nanotube (CNT) synthesis via catalytic chemical vapor deposition is relatively energy consumptive and among the least efficient reactions with respect to carbon conversion efficiency. Interestingly, these processes can be fed using a diverse set of hydrocarbon starting materials, including methane, ethylene, and acetylene, over a wide range of operating temperatures and carbon-to-hydrogen feedstock ratios. Mapping the parameter space for successful CNT growth through data extraction from published literature illuminated the most energy-and material-efficient synthetic pathways in practice to date and provided insights on thermodynamic limitation of CNT growth (i.e., the fundamental mechanisms of CNT formation). Further experimental investigations confirmed that emergent trends in the literature were the result of physicochemical constraints on the process rather than behavioral inertia in the community. The initiation temperatures for CNT growth from acetylene, ethylene, and methane feedstocks via direct experimentation were 550, 700, and 950 degrees C, respectively, consistent with the trend in literature-extracted mean optima (642 +/- 128, 739 +/- 82, and 858 +/- 125 degrees C, respectively). These relative temperatures are consistent with a universal CNT growth mechanism, wherein all carbon feedstocks are converted to alkyne-containing species that serve as direct precursors for CNT growth. Mitigating this step with rational carbon precursor delivery, rather than relying on heat to generate the most reactive precursors in situ, could largely reduce the environmental burdens in CNT manufacturing. Indeed, manipulating the starting gas-phase composition and minimizing the thermal treatment through the use of C2H2 increased carbon conversion yield by a factor of more than 10 compared to C2H4, and, consequently, should minimize hazardous volatile organic compound and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions. The methodology utilized in this study is transferrable to guide the green synthesis of other materials and should be automated in the future for high-throughput screening of the vast process chemistry literature.

In this study, ILs with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (Tf2N) as the anion were investigated as the electrolyte in onion-like carbon-based electrochemical capacitors. To probe the influence of cations on the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors, three different cations were used: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium and 1,6-bis(3-methylimidazolium-1-yl). A series of electrochemical characterization tests was performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Diffusion coefficients were measured using EIS and correlated with quasielastic neutron scattering and molecular dynamics simulation. These three techniques were used in parallel to confirm a consistent trend between the three ILs. It was found that the IL with the smaller sized cation had a larger diffusion coefficient, leading to a higher capacitance at faster charge-discharge rates. Furthermore, the IL electrolyte performance was correlated with increasing temperature, which limited the voltage stability window and led to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase on the carbon electrode surface, evident in both the CV and EIS experiments.

Preliminary Study on Corrosion Behaviour of Carbon Steel in Oil-Water Two-Phase Fluids	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Carbon steel; Corrosion behavior; Wetting; Fluid flow; Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy	ELECTROCHEMICAL CORROSION; EROSION-CORROSION; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; CO2 CORROSION; SAND SLURRY; X-65 STEEL; EMULSIONS; PRODUCTS	The corrosion behavior of type 1045 (AISI) carbon steel (CS) in oil-water fluids was investigated by considering the surface wetting state as the breakthrough point. The surface water wetting percentage (SWWP) and corrosion weight loss of CS in different oil-water fluids were measured. The morphology and composition of the corrosion films were detected via scanning electron microscopy, electron-probe face-scanning technology and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The results indicated that the corrosion weight loss of CS in the oil-water fluids corresponded with SWWP and that the corrosion process was influenced by the participation of oil.

The FeMnO3@NC composite can inherit the nanocage-like structure of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursor, which is capable of buffering volume expansion and promoting the penetration of electrolyte. The nitrogen-doped carbon layer enhances the electronic transmission and structure stability of perovskite-type FeMnO3. Therefore, the composite electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performances, including desirable rate capability, excellent cycling stability and high capacity of similar to 1008 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 A g(-1). Considering the features of FeMnO3@NC composite with environmental friendliness, low cost, and outstanding lithium ion storage performance, it is expected to become a promising material for new hybrid energy storage devices.

Tribological behavior of diamond like carbon film sliding against CoCrMo or Al2O3 in air and water environment	TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Diamond like carbon; Lubricated wear; Debris analysis	METAL HIP REPLACEMENTS; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; DLC-COATINGS; STEEL; WEAR; LUBRICATION; FRICTION; OIL	The effect of counterface material (CoCrMo and Al2O3) on the tribological behavior of hydrogen free diamond like carbon (DLC) film in air and water environment was investigated. The results show CoCrMo causes unstable high friction and high DLC wear in air environment owing to the unstable transfer layer rich in metal oxide. Al2O3 induces less DLC wear than CoCrMo in air due to reduced adhesive wear and solid lubrication. In water environment, CoCrMo brings extremely low wear of DLC film due to the high graphitized transfer material adhering on the counterface and water preventing adhesive wear. For Al2O3 counterpart, relatively high DLC wear is produces in water environment because of the high hardness of Al2O3 and insufficient solid lubrication. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we propose to synthesize multivalent polyanion-dispersed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for fabrication of nanostructured fibrous scaffolds with capabilities on controlling the fate of induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS). First, the CNTs are noncovalently functionalized by hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (hPGS) via sonication, and the stability and biocompatibility of hPGS-dispersed CNTs are compared with commercial dispersants. Then, the nanostructured fibrous scaffolds are prepared by coating hPGS-dispersed CNTs onto the electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) fiber substrates to achieve PCL-CNT-hPGS. Our results show that these fibrous scaffolds can serve as a biocompatible platform for promoting the adhesion and proliferation of IPS cells. Meanwhile, the immunostaining shows that the nanostructured fibrous scaffolds induce higher neural differentiation efficiency compared to the control substrates. Moreover, we also validate that the aligned fibrous scaffolds can guide the orientation of generated neurites. Overall, a new multivalent polyanion-dispersed CNT has been utilized to construct highly bioactive nanostructured fibrous scaffolds, which not only combine physical and chemical cues to offer beneficial microenvironments for controlling the fate of IPS cells, but also present a new avenue for constructing carbon nanomaterials functionalized composites in tissue regeneration, bionic, biomedical, and bioelectronics.

For the first time, the control of carbon fibers' orientation in DIW was studied by numerical simulation. An interfacial layer was prepared by chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). The microstructure and phase composition of C-f/SiC were studied by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The results showed that fibers of different interfacial thicknesses could be obtained effectively by varying the CVI time. The breakage of short fibres remarkably improved the fracture toughness of the parts. The specimens showed excellent mechanical properties with bending strength of 274 +/- 13 MPa and fracture toughness of 5.82 +/- 0.25 MPa m(1/2). This method could be extended to the preparation of other resin and ceramic composites.

Results indicated that the SWNT membrane showed a clear adsorption preference of fibrinogen over albumin. However, there was no appreciable platelet adhesion and activation occurred consequently on a SWNT membrane surface pre-absorbed with fresh plasma, and the percentage of activated platelets caused by a SWNT membrane in a platelet-rich-plasma was about 5%. The conclusion is that the SWNT membrane has unique platelet inertness in blood environments and this anticoagulant effect permits potential use in artificial organs, prostheses and tissue engineering in the cardiac-vascular systems.

According to the RSM results, temperature and reaction time were found to be the most important control factors. The possible optimum conditions were found to be 207 degrees C and 82 min for temperature and time, respectively, in order to achieve a hydrochar with the maximum mass yield (solid yield 53.38%), carbon recovery rate (52.66), and O/C ratio (0.69). Furthermore, the optimized hydrochar was successfully activated via potassium hydroxide (KOH), under mild activation conditions. Synthesized microporous activated carbon demonstrated the highly improved Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 474.87 m(2) g(-1)compared to the low BET surface area of mesoporous hydrochar (S-BET of 2.69 m(2) g(-1)). Porous activated carbon was used as an adsorbent for methylene blue removal that showed a promising dye removal capacity of 93.4 mg g(-1). The morphological and chemical compositions of the solid materials were analyzed by various techniques, including elemental analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), BET analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.

Molybdenum (Mo)-based compounds are reported as highly active and inexpensive alternatives to platinum-based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Currently, the major challenge for Mo-based HER electrocatalysts lies in establishing new concepts of micro-/nanostructure design to enhance the hydrogen evolution kinetics and realizing facile, large-scale, and green fabrication processes. Here, a fast, scalable, and eco-friendly metal-organic coordination precursor-assisted strategy is reported for synthesizing novel hierarchically mesoporous Mo-based carbon electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production. Benefiting from homogeneously distributed Mo-based nanocrystallites/heterojunctions and uniform mesopores, the Mo-based mesoporous electrocatalyst shows high hydrogen evolution activity and stability with a low overpotential of 222 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) (Pt/C: 263 mV), ranging among the best non-noble metal HER catalysts in alkaline condition. Overall, the discovery of using dopamine-molybdate coordination precursor with silica nanoparticles will not only create a new pathway for controllable synthesis of diverse kinds of micro-/nanostructured Mo-based catalysts, but also take a step toward the fast and scale-up production of advanced mesoporous carbon electrodes for a broad range of applications.

CANON process was initiated in a SBBR from conventional activated sludge. An operation temperature of 32 +/- 2 A degrees C, dissolved oxygen (DO) level at 1.5 mg L-1 and free ammonia (FA) concentration with 3.98-15.93 mg L-1 were maintained in the SBBR. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and Boehm's neutralizing titration exhibited that modified ACFs had more oxygen-containing groups than unmodified ACFs. Larger biofilm growth on the modified surfaces examined by scanning electron microscopy and biofilm's total dry weight, and the biofilm on the modified surfaces were more active, compared with those on the unmodified surfaces. This study demonstrates the hydrophilic-modified ACFs have better biological affinity than unmodified ACFs. Maximal total nitrogen removal rate of 0.088 k g N m(-3) day(-1) was achieved for the CANON process on day 80, indicating the CANON process was successfully started up. Apart from supports, the strategies of DO supplying and controlling FA concentration were also keys in starting up the CANON process within a shorter period.

Mimicking enzymatic enantioselectivity remains a great challenge. Herein, we report that cysteine-derived chiral carbon dots (CDs) can mimic topoisomerase I to mediate topological rearrangement of supercoiled DNA enantioselectively. d-CDs can more effectively catalyze the topological transition of plasmid DNA from supercoiled to nicked open-circular configuration than l-CDs. Experiments suggest the underlying mechanism: d-CDs intercalatively bind with DNA double helix more strongly than l-CDs; the intercalative CDs can catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals to cleave phosphate backbone in one strand of the double helix, leading to topological rearrangement of supercoiled DNA. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that the stronger affinity for hydrogen-bond formation and hydrophobic interaction between d-cysteine and DNA than that of l-cysteine is the origin of enantioselectivity.

The single-crystalline LiMn2O4 particles with a diameter of about 200-400 nm are homogeneously distributed and entrapped in the mechanically robust and highly conductive carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffolds, which not only improves the energy density by eliminating the use of conventional metal current collectors, polymer binders and conductive additives, but also effectively alleviates the aggregation of LiMn2O4 nanoparticles. The as-synthesized LMO-CF-in situ electrode exhibits attractive rate capability with an 86.2% retention of the capacity at 1C achieved at 5C, excellent cycling stability with an 82.1% specific capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1C and high coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%.

Interestingly, the obtained HPUHs obviously without containing conventional chromophores exhibit conspicuous ultraviolet absorbency and bright blue photoluminescence when irradiated by a UV lamp with 365 nm wavelength. The excitation and emission intensities of the as-prepared polymers progressively grow along with raising their molecular weights and concentrations, and even the brightest blue glow in the solid state is observed, suggesting the emission intensity is molecular-weight and concentration-dependent. The preliminary investigation indicates that both the carbon-carbon double bond and the hydroxyl group are very important in the formation of blue-luminescent species. Thus, this work opens a new route to design new light-emitting materials.

The CZTS@C microstructures with enhanced electrical conductivity and improved Li-ion diffusivity exhibit high areal and gravimetric capacities of 2.45 mA h/cm(2) and 1366 mA h/g, respectively. The areal capacity achieved in the present study is higher than that of previously reported CZTS-based materials. Moreover, in situ X-ray diffraction results show that lithium ions are stored in CZTS through the insertion reaction, followed by the alloying and conversion reactions at similar to 1 V. The structural evolution of Li2S and Cu-Sn/Cu-Zn alloy phases occurs during the conversion and alloying reactions. The present work provides a cost-effective and simple method to prepare bulk CZTS and highlights the conformal carbon coating over CZTS, which can enhance the electrical and ionic conductivities of CZTS materials and increase the mass loading (1-2.3 mg/cm(2)). The improved stability and rate capability of CZTS@C anode materials can therefore be achieved.

Two types of sensing mechanisms were revealed. Type A sensors, whose electrodes were directly printed on the CNTNs and embedded in epoxy resin, take advantage of the intrinsic piezoresistive properties of highly oriented carbon nanotube bundles and exhibited large positive gauge factor. Type B sensors, whose electrodes were printed on the polyimide substrate, utilize the effects of applied strains on the contact resistances between layers of the CNTN structure and between CNTN and the electrodes, exhibited large negative gauge factors. Type A and B sensors achieved positive and negative gauge factors up to 20 and 40 in magnitude, respectively. The high performance and flexible nature of the sensors, combined with the capability of scalable manufacturing processes, exhibits promising application potentials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we have developed the nitrogen-doped carbon coated MnO porous microspheres (MnO@NC), which consist of small nanocrystals with interparticle mesopores via a self-templated solvothermal synthesis and subsequent in-situ pyrolysis of polypyrrole precursors. By virtue of the conductive outer layer of nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) and the abundant inner mesopores, the hierarchical MnO@NC porous microspheres manifest the superior lithium storage properties as anode for LIBs. In detail, the optimized MnO@NC electrode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1037 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), remains the discharge capacity of 890 mAh g(-1) at 1A g(-1) after 500 cycles, indicates the outstanding rate capability with a specific capacity of 450 mAh g(-1) at 5A g(-1).

It is well known that a single carbon nanotube (CNT) presents highly 1-D conduction. For a thin film composed of numerous aligned CNTs, the anisotropic conduction may be preserved to some extent, as this is useful for various applications. In this paper, the anisotropic conduction of HA-MWCNT thin films is investigated in a rectangular waveguide measurement setup. The anisotropic surface conductivities of the films along the nanotube axial and radial directions are extracted from the measured S-parameters. The results reveal an anisotropic conductivity ratio of about 2 for the HA-MWCNTs thin film. Furthermore, it is observed that the real part of the extracted conductivity remains constant over the frequency band while the imaginary part increases almost linearly with frequency.

In this study, HPGACs are directly synthesized from lignite at 900 degrees C. The whole process is completed by a microwave pretreatment, a graphitization conversion of the carbon framework at a low temperature using a small amount of FeCl3 (10-30 wt%), and a subsequent physical activation using CO2. Consequently, the dispersed and mobile iron species, in the absence of oxygen functional groups (removed during the microwave pretreatment), can greatly promote catalytic graphitization during pyrolysis, and, as an activating catalyst, can further facilitate the porosity development during activation. The as-obtained AC-2FeHLH-5-41.4(H) presents a low defect density, high purity, and specific surface area of 1852.43 m(2) g(-1), which is far greater than the AC-HLH-5-55.6(H) obtained solely by physical activation. AC-2FeHLH-5-41.4(H) as a supercapacitor electrode presents an excellent performance in the further electrochemical measurements. Such a convenient and practical method with low cost proves a scalable method to prepare HPGACs from a wide range of coal/biomass materials for industrial scale-up and applications.

As recent studies have shown that TCCON (Total Carbon Column Observing Network) measurement footprints embrace quasi-global coverage, we examined the sensitivity of TCCON to the global CO2 growth. To this end, we used the aggregated TCCON observations (2006-2019) to retrieve Annual Growth Rate of CO2 (AGR) at global scales. The global AGR estimates from TCCON (AGRTCCON) are robust and independent, from (a) the station-wise seasonality, from (b) the differences in time series across the TCCON stations, and from (c) the type of TCCON stations used in the calculation ("background" or "contaminated" by neighboring CO2 sources). The AGRTCCON potential error, due to the irregular data sampling is relatively low (2.4-17.9%). In 2006-2019, global AGRTCCON ranged from the minimum of 1.59 +/- 2.27 ppm (2009) to the maximum of 3.27 +/- 0.82 ppm (2016), whereas the uncertainties express sub-annual variability and the data gap effects. The global AGRTCCON magnitude is similar to the reference AGR from satellite data (AGRSAT = 1.57-2.94 ppm) and the surface-based estimates of Global Carbon Budget (AGRGCB = 1.57-2.85). The highest global CO2 growth rate (2015/2016), caused by the record El Nino, was nearly perfectly reproduced by the TCCON (AGRTCCON = 3.27 +/- 0.82 ppm vs. AGRSAT = 3.23 +/- 0.50 ppm). The overall agreement between global AGRTCCON with the AGR references was yet weakened (r = 0.37 for TCCON vs. SAT; r = 0.50 for TCCON vs. GCB) due to two years (2008, 2015). We identified the drivers of this disagreement; in 2008, when only few stations were available worldwide, the AGRTCCON uncertainties were excessively high (AGRTCCON = 2.64 ppm with 3.92 ppm or 148% uncertainty). Moreover, in 2008 and 2015, the ENSO-driven bias between global AGRTCCON and the AGR references were detected. TCCON-to-reference agreement is dramatically increased if the years with ENSOrelated biases (2008, 2015) are forfeited (r = 0.67 for TCCON vs. SAT, r = 0.82 for TCCON vs. GCB). To conclude, this is the first study that showed promising ability of aggregated TCCON signal to capture global CO2 growth. As the TCCON coverage is expanding, and new versions of TCCON data are being published, multiple data sampling strategies, dynamically changing TCCON global measurement footprint, and the irregular sensitivity of AGRTCCON to strong ENSO events; all should be analyzed to transform the current efforts into a first operational algorithm for retrieving global CO2 growth from TCCON data.

However, the low electrical conductivity and severe volume expansion occurring during the ion insertion/extraction process hamper their practical application. Herein, a novel dual-annealing design has been developed for the synthesis of highly uniform MoO2 nanopopcorns decorated with nitrogen-doped carbon shell (MoO2/NC). Owing to the unique structural characteristics and vital amorphous NC component, the MoO2/NC nanopopcorn hybrid composite exhibits stabilized charge storage capacity of 1073 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles for LIBs, while 301 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles for SIBS at 0.5 A g(-1). Furthermore, when the current density increases to 5 A g(-1), the specific capacity could still maintain 630 mAh g(-1) and 174 mAh g(-1) for LIBs and SIBS, respectively, which disclose the outstanding rate capability of MoO2/NC nanopopcorn anode.

A multi-criteria allocation of China's carbon emission allowance	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Paris Agreement; Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs); Multi-criteria allocation; Zero sum gains-data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA); Carbon emission allowance (CEA); Space for carbon emissions (SCE)	CO2 EMISSIONS; REGIONAL ALLOCATION; EFFICIENCY; ENERGY; QUOTAS; CONSUMPTION; WELL	Accelerating global warming has suggested the importance of controlling greenhouse gas emissions associated with human activities. In striving to fulfill the Paris Agreement, China has announced its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) aimed at reducing its carbon dioxide (CO2) emission intensity by 60-65% in 2030 against the level of 2005. However, China's INDCs cannot be fulfilled without formulating appropriate schemes for the allocation of carbon emission allowance (CEA) at sub-national scales. To help close the gap in our knowledge, this paper starts with measuring the overall CEA of China by 2030, and then proposes a science based scheme for CEA allocation by developing an improved zero sum gains-data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA) model. It demonstrates that the final CEA of some northern provinces can be cut down as compared to their initial shares and, conversely, most southern provinces experience an increase in their CEA. Comparing the final share of CEA by province with current carbon emissions, we observe that provinces with abundant energy reserves, such as Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, tend to be operating in a state of overshoot in terms of space for carbon emissions (SCE). In contrast, there remains SCE when it comes to Guangdong, Hunan, Fujian, etc. The remaining provinces, such as Heilongjiang, Hebei and Ningxia, are close to the break-even point. In view of the differing SCE of individual provinces, common but differentiated policies for CO2 emission control would be the key to achieving China's INDCs. The research findings lay a scientific basis for the Chinese government to make its INDCs come true through inter-provincial collaboration on emission reduction, but also serve as a reference for fueling further scientific discussions and development of schemes for the allocation of responsibility for carbon emissions at multiple scales within and beyond China.

Here, a series of cobalt-molybdenum alloy nanorods encapsulated in N-doped carbon shells (CoMo@NC) is synthesized via an in-situ carbonization-reduction method using CoMoO4 as the precursor. The high conductivity, strain-induced effect, and synergistic interactions between N-doped carbon and bimetallic cores endow the optimized catalyst with outperforming catalytic performances for HER and OER in alkaline solution with low overpotentials (98 mV for HER and 336 mV for OER at 10 mA cm-2), as well as high durability. The overall water splitting device using the CoMo@NC sample achieved at 800 celcius treatment (CoMo@NC-800) as bifunctional catalyst could possess a low voltage of 1.67 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and high durability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal that the pyridinic-N atoms of graphene anchored on CoMo alloy nanoparticles can efficiently modulate the electronic structure to generate optimal free energy of hydrogen adsorption (-0.029 eV), suggesting excellent HER intrinsic activity. This work may provide a facile avenue to achieve multiple metallic alloy-based nanomaterials for boosting electrochemical water splitting performance.

Here, we report a microporous sulfur-doped carbon (S-C) as a support for sintering-resistant metal nanoclusters based on the strong interaction between metal and doped sulfur (S) atoms. The S-C support is prepared by carbonization of microporous conjugated poly(3,3'-bithiophene), which has a robust three-dimensional cross-linked network structure. The structural features of the conjugated polymer-derived S-C support, including high S contents of up to similar to 26.9 wt % and large specific surface areas of 708-1019 m(2) g(-1), make it capable of anchoring similar to 1 nm platinum (Pt) clusters even with a high Pt loading of 20 wt %. Remarkably, the S-C-supported Pt nanocluster catalysts can tolerate high-temperature treatments up to 700 degrees C in a reductive atmosphere or harsh hydrothermal treatments (alkaline water, 2 M bar of H-2, and 200 degrees C for 12 h). Moreover, the S-C-supported Pt nanocluster catalysts exhibit a much enhanced catalytic performance for formic acid oxidation compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst owing to the small-size effects.

Multiwalled carbon nanotube sheets as transparent electrodes in high brightness organic light-emitting diodes	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article						carbon nanotubes; electrochemical electrodes; indium compounds; nanotube devices; organic light emitting diodes; polymers	TRANSPORT LAYER; COMPOSITE; POLYMER	We have fabricated efficient organic light emitting diodes using strong, transparent carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets as the hole-injecting anode. These devices show a brightness of 4500 cd/m(2) and current efficiency near 2.5 cd/A, which is close to the efficiency we achieve with a similar device, which uses indium tin oxide (ITO) as the anode. We demonstrate that proper planarization of the electrode using the water-soluble polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) is necessary for achieving high efficiency and can be accomplished by spin casting multiple layers. We believe that increased conductivity of the sheets could lead to CNT-based devices with efficiencies exceeding those on ITO.

When used as sodium-ion battery anode, the enlarged interlayer distance benefits sodium ion insertion/extraction and the interconnected nanosheets structure not only facilitates the contact of electrolyte but also shortens the sodium ion diffusion path. Additionally, the chemisorption of the sodium ion with nitrogen and oxygen containing functional groups on surface can further improve the electrochemical performance. The carbon frameworks exhibit reversible specific capacities of 272 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and 121 mA h g(-1) even at 10 A g(-1), a high capacity retention of 93.4% at 2 A g(-1) after 1000 cycles, indicating its good rate capability and very long lifespan. Sodium-ion full cells consisting of carbon frameworks anode and Na3V2(PO4)(3) cathode are assembled. The full cells deliver high discharge capacity (210 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)) and superior stability of 1000 cycles (0.012% capacity loss per cycle). The present paper proposes a universal approach for rational design of high-performance sodium-ion battery anode from highly aromatic precursors by molecular engineering.

In this paper, a series of coal-char samples were prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures, rates, and residence times. The effect of the pyrolysis temperature on the physicochemical structure in coal char is important because it can control the breakage and recombination of different types of chemical bonds. The impact of the pyrolysis rate gradually increases with increasing temperature, indicating that its influence is closely related to the pyrolysis temperature. However, an extension of the residence time at different pyrolysis temperatures and rates can only help the evolution of the chemical structure. It was determined that the typical char (KJX800-40) produced by rapid pyrolysis at 800 degrees C over a long residence time (40 min) is the most suitable for subsequent activation due to its disordered carbon structure, abundant initial pores, and active sites. The initial pores that developed in the KJX800-40 char facilitate the diffusion of activated gas to avoid serious carbon losses on the surface of the particles; alternatively, more active sites help the etching of the carbon structure to promote the rapid and continuous development of the micropores, following nonhierarchical development. On the basis of these results, a pyrolysis condition with a high S-BET (859.14 m(2)/g)/burn-off ratio (25.2%) of 34.09 m(2)/(g center dot%) was identified.

Length effect of carbon nanotubes on the strengthening mechanisms in metal matrix composites	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Metal matrix composites (MMCs); Carbon nanotubes (CNTs); Strengthening mechanisms; Orowan mechanism; Load transfer; Length effect	LOAD-TRANSFER; INTERFACIAL REACTION; POWDER-METALLURGY; MILLING TIME; DISPERSION; MODEL; MICROSTRUCTURES; HARDNESS	In the present work, we studied the effect of the aspect ratio of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on strengthening aluminum metal matrix composites (Al MMCs). To this end, Al samples reinforced with CNTs of various aspect ratios were produced via three different powder metallurgy methods. Microstructural examination revealed that the CNTs were uniformly dispersed in the materials with a range of aspect ratios from 6.5 to 55. The tensile results showed that the CNTs exhibited a strong strengthening effect in the composites regardless of their aspect ratios. However, the post-loading examination and quantitative analysis indicated that there was a strengthening mechanism transition for CNTs, which was closely associated with the aspect ratio or length of CNTs. The origin of such transition was explored from the viewpoint of dislocation-CNTs interaction under loading. The findings may provide a new insight in understanding the strengthening behaviors of CNT-reinforced MMCs. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We focused on how the structure of the adsorbed B, T, and X molecules is influenced by pore size, in particular the effects of the methyl groups in the cases of toluene and p-xylene. The packing density of the compounds in the pores was found to follow the order B < T < X at low loadings but X < T < B at high loadings. Furthermore, various molecular orientations were observed in the different pore sizes, including parallel, perpendicular, and parallel combined with perpendicular, and the nearest neighboring molecules assumed to undergo an edge-wise or T-shaped interaction. For parallel molecules, two adjacent molecules were aligned in an edge-wise interaction, which is the most favorable for solid-fluid interactions. However, for perpendicular molecules, two adjacent molecules were arranged in a T-shape, which is more favorable for fluid-fluid interactions. For the perpendicular toluene and p-xylene molecules, the angle between the methyl group and the pore walls was found to be 30 degrees. In the smallest pore studied, the benzene molecules were found to adopt a 2D hexagonally packed solid-like state, whereas the toluene and p-xylene molecules were in a liquid-like state. Consequently, the microscopic structures of B, T, X in various sized pores were investigated. The molecular models showed that the fluid-fluid interactions were significant for B, T, X adsorption, except for the cases of toluene and p-xylene in pores that can accommodate more than one molecular layer, where the solid-fluid interactions play a more dominant role because of the enhanced solid-fluid interactions of the toluene and p-xylene molecules oriented in parallel to each other. In addition, we have compared the results of our simulation with experimental data from previous research. The simulated isotherm agrees reasonably well with the experimentally obtained isotherm, and the simulated nearest-neighbor distance between the adsorbed molecules is almost the same as the experimental value.

In the composite, amorphous red phosphorous is mainly loaded into the micropores of the AC matrix. The P/AC composite delivers an excellent capacity up to about 1550 mAh g (1) that is calculated on the basis of composite weight. The high capacity means that approximate 3 electrons are involved in the electrode reaction. At the same time, the P/AC composite exhibits a good cyclability with a capacity retention ratio of 83.6% after 50 cycles. Furthermore, the coulombic efficiency maintains above 97.5% in all the cycles except for the first cycle (76.1%). During the initial cycle, the lithiated and delithiated P/AC anode are further investigated. The formation of SEI film in the initial active process is confirmed. The high and stable electrochemical performance of P/AC composite benefits from the nanoscale of active mass P particles and its homogeneous dispersion onto the conductive AC substrate.

The reaction proceeds smoothly under simple and mild conditions and exhibits a broad scope of delta-CF3-delta-aryl disubstituted para-quinone methides in high efficiency. delta-CF3-delta-alkynyl-disubstituted para-quinone methides also proved to be suitable substrates. The rich chemistry of the cyano moiety allows for rapid access to other valuable CF3-substituted di- and triarylmethanes containing all-carbon quaternary centers that are otherwise difficult to synthesize. The generality of the method was further demonstrated by cyanation of delta-CN-substituted para-quinone methides furnishing diarylmalononitriles in good yields.

Using the high- capacity hydrogen storage candidate LiAlH4 as an exemplar, we demonstrate an alternative approach to the thermodynamic stabilization of metastable metal hydrides by coordination to nitrogen binding sites within the nanopores of N-doped CMK-3 carbon (NCMK-3). The resulting LiAlH4@NCMK-3 material releases H-2 at temperatures as low as 126 degrees C with full decomposition below 240 degrees C, bypassing the usual Li3AlH6 intermediate observed in bulk. Moreover, >80% of LiAlH4 can be regenerated under 100 MPa H-2, a feat previously thought to be impossible. Nitrogen sites are critical to these improvements, as no reversibility is observed with undoped CMK-3. Density functional theory predicts a drastically reduced Al-H bond dissociation energy and supports the observed change in the reaction pathway. The calculations also provide a rationale for the solid-state reversibility, which derives from the combined effects of nanoconfinement, Li adatom formation, and charge redistribution between the metal hydride and the host.

In this paper, a novel activated carbon (AC) supported cobalt(II) tetraaminophthalocyanine (AC-CoTAPc) catalyst was prepared by the chemical grafting method. EA, UV-vis, FT-IR, BET and XPS were used to characterize the structure of the new catalyst. The effects of reaction time, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature and oxygen pressure on SMM conversion per pass (CPPSMM), yield (Yield(DMDS)) and purity of DMDS product (Purity(DMDS)) were investigated to evaluate the catalytic performance of new AC-CoTAPc catalyst. The results show that free CoTAPc is easily dissolved in this DMDS product, which needs extra post treatment and cannot be reused. The supported catalyst AC-CoTAPc can easily solve these problems and can be properly reused four times to get Yield(DMDS) and CPPSMM higher than 70% and 90%. Under optimum conditions, the Yield(DMDS) and CPPSMM of the AC-CoTAPc catalyst could be as high as 87.4% and 98.1%, with a purity of DMDS product of above 99.9%. AC-CoTAPc exhibits better catalytic and reuse performance than the commercial AC-supported sulphonated cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (AC-CoPcS) catalyst and shows broad industrial application prospects.

In this study, Magneli phase Ti4O7 nanotube arrays (NTA) were grown on titanium nitride mesh substrates via anodization of titanium mesh followed by high-temperature reduction under a hydrogen atmosphere. When prepared into a composite material with sulphur via electrodeposition, Ti4O7 NTA provides sulphur with high electronic conductivity and strong polysulphide chemisorption during battery operation. The structure of NTA allows sufficient access of incorporated sulphur to the liquid electrolyte and supports high sulphur loadings per unit area of the electrode. The application of an additional layer of conductive carbon coating to confine electrodeposited sulphur inside the NTA further improved the cell cycling performance. Under sulphur loadings of around 2.0 mg/cm(2), high values of specific capacity (1604 mAh/g at a 1/20 C rate), ultra-low capacity decay rate (0.03% per cycle for 1800 cycles), and versatile rate capability (660 mAh/g at 2 C and 500 mAh/g at 4 C) were achieved. Under high sulphur loadings of around 5.0 mg/cm(2), stable cycling (decay rate below 0.10% per cycle) and high areal capacity (4.97 mAh/cm(2)) were attained.

In the composite structure, PVP not only facilitates better dispersion of SACNT bundles into a 3D continuous network, but also encapsulates the sulfur nanoparticles onto the SACNT network to ensure their tight electrical connection and prevent polysulfide dissolution. Combining the advantages of the high conductive and porous SACNT network and the PVP surface modification, the PVP@S-SACNT cathode exhibits excellent cyclic stability (initial capacity of 1303 mA h g(-1), and 856 mA h g(-1), after 200 cycles at 1 C) and high-rate performance (590 mA h g(-1), at 20 C). Moreover, the PVP@S-SACNT composite presents excellent long-term capacity stability with a capacity decay of 0.052% per cycle during 1000 charge/discharge cycles at 2 C. With these appealing performances, the PVP@S-SACNT composite becomes a promising cathode material for the next-generation rechargeable batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The activated carbon was characterized in detail. After loading various transition metals, including Cu2+, Ag+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ via the ultrasonic-assisted impregnation method, a series of metal-loaded adsorbents (xM-AC) were obtained and their dimethyl sulfide (DMS) adsorption performance was investigated in a batch system. Among these adsorbents, 15Cu-AC presented a superior DMS adsorption capacity equating to 58.986 mg/g due to the formation of S-M (sigma) bonds between Cu2+ and sulfur atoms of DMS as confirmed by the Raman spectra and kinetic study.

Then, we measured per capital CERLE of China's 30 provinces from 2007 to 2012 and analyzed its distribution by using quartile maps, and finally used Moran's I index to conduct spatial correlation diagnoses. Empirical results indicate that energy structure can lead to a decrease in per capital CERLE while urbanization rate, resident consumption level and energy intensity are opposite. The estimated elastic coefficients suggest that energy structure is the most important driving factor of per capital CERLE. Additionally, the coefficients increase after the spatial correlation factors in the regions are introduced, which indicated that it will underestimate the effect of the driving factors on per capital CERLE if the spatial factors are not taken into account.

Theoretically, neutral electrolyte-based Mg-air batteries possess potential advantages in electronics and biomedical applications over the other metal-air counterparts, especially the alkaline-based Zn-air batteries. However, the rational design of advanced oxygen electrode for Mg-air batteries with high discharge voltage and capacity under neutral conditions still remains a major challenge. Inspired by fibrous string structures of bufo-spawn, it is reported here that the scalable synthesis of atomic Fe-N-x coupled open-mesoporous N-doped-carbon nanofibers (OM-NCNF-FeNx) as advanced oxygen electrode for Mg-air batteries. The fabricated OM-NCNF-FeNx electrodes present manifold advantages, including open-mesoporous and interconnected structures, 3D hierarchically porous networks, good bio-adaptability, homogeneously coupled atomic Fe-N-x sites, and high oxygen electrocatalytic performances. Most importantly, the assembled Mg-air batteries with neutral electrolytes reveal high open-circuit voltage, stable discharge voltage plateaus, high capacity, long operating life, and good flexibility. Overall, the discovery on fabricating atomic OM-NCNF-FeNx electrode will not only create new pathways for achieving flexible, wearable, and bio-adaptable power sources, but also take a step towards the scale-up production of advanced nanofibrous carbon electrodes for a broad range of applications.

In this manuscript, a novel hierarchical nanoporous carbon@nickel hydroxide (HNCMs@Ni(OH)2) composites were prepared through simple in-situ chemical deposition of Ni(OH)2 nanocrystals on HNCMs. By tailoring the deposition amount, core-shell structured rambutan-like HNCMs@Ni (OH)2 microspheres with hairy nickel hydroxide nanocrystal covered on HNCMs were obtained. Ascribed to the high specific capacitance of nickel hydroxide and the interconnected hierarchical porous structure of HNCMs, the resultant rambutan-like HNCMs@Ni(OH)2 microspheres as electrode materials display outstanding electrochemical properties including high specific capacity of 248.9 mAh/g at 1 A/g and good capacitance retention of 62.9% at 20 A/g. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor with rambutan-like HNCMs@Ni(OH)2 microspheres as cathode and HNCMs as anode were assembled and showed a comparable energy density of 41.3 Wh/kg at the power density of 173.3 W/kg and high capacity retention of 85.2% after 20,000 cycles at 5 A/g. As a proof of concept example, the fabricated hybrid supercapacitor can be utilized as energy source to instantaneous light up a red LED indicator.

Reduced graphene oxide (rGO), Chitosan (CS) and AuNPs were layer by layer modified on glass carbon electrode (GCE), which effectively enhanced electron transfer and provided excellent large electrochemical active surface area. Polythionine-Au composites prepared by chemical reduction method greatly amplified electrochemical signal with high conductivity and large surface area. The prepared immunosensor showed high sensitivity, good stability and selectivity for detection of CEA with a wide range of 0.3 ng/mL to 30 ng/mL (R-2 = 0.9972) and a detection limit as low as 0.1471 pg/mL. Furthermore, this sandwich-type immunosensor might be as a versatile platform for reliable early cancer diagnostics clinical.

Burst strength of carbon fibre reinforced polyethylene strip pipeline repair system - a numerical and experimental approach	JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						Finite element analysis; carbon fibre; epoxy sleeve; burst strength; riser		Oil and gas pipelines are susceptible to various forms of damage where repair mechanisms have since been developed for rehabilitation. Once installed, structural health monitoring often incurs excessive costs and defects rectification of the repaired pipeline becomes a major challenge. Finite element analysis (FEA) provides a rapid route to predict the behaviour of the rehabilitated pipelines under prescribed in-service conditions. In this paper, burst strength of a commercially available composite sleeve repair system, Helicoid Epoxy Sleeve (HES), which combines the use of carbon fibre strip and epoxy grout as reinforcement to damaged pipe, was investigated through experimental and numerical approaches. Design standards for subsea pipelines are used in the calculation of design pressure and burst pressure. In the experimental setup, API 5L X52 steel pipe was machined with 50% metal loss defect in wall thickness to simulate external corrosion. Results from design calculations, experimental and FEA showed good correlation with margin less than 10%.	[Chan, P. H.; Tshai, K.

To evaluate the environmental exposure level and protect human from the hazard of BPA, a precise and sensitive method is established. In this work, Graphene@ Fe3O4 (G@Fe3O4) is prepared by chemical coprecipitation method as magnetic dispersion solid phase extraction (MDSPE) material. The rapid and specific detection method of BPA is carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Properties of G@Fe3O4 are identified by the fourier infrared spectrum and scanning electron microscopy. Conditions of solid phase extraction are optimized. Under the optimal extraction conditions, G@Fe3O4 has perfect enrichment effect on BPA. There is a good linear relationship in the range of 5.0 similar to 1000.0 mu g/L with the correlation coefficient of 0.9997. The detection limit is 0.1 mu g/L. This method is applied to water samples successfully, and recoveries of BPA are between 88.19% and 99.56% (RSDs < 3.00%). G@Fe3O4 was synthesized, which was used to extract BPA in water samples before HPLC analysis, and has shown perfect extraction ability toward BPA, which indicates that the determination method of BPA by HPLC based on graphene MDSPE is faster and more precise.

The high dispersion and homogeneity of the cathode layer result in high capacity Li/S batteries. Additional use of LiNO3 as additive improved the discharge capacity to 800 Ah kgs(-1), 400 Ah kg(cathode)(-1) (at 0.18 C) and 410 Ah kgs(-1), 205 Ah kg(cathode)(-1) (at 2 C) after 50 cycles. The shuttle mechanism is reduced and a coulombic efficiency of around 100% is reached and maintained constant until 1000 cycles. To understand more the degradation mechanisms of the battery, Thermogravimetry combined with gas analysis (TG/MS) as well X-ray diffraction (operando and mappings) were applied. The formation of an amorphous phase during cycling that remains nearly stable in the later cycles is considered to be one of the main factors affecting capacity decay. Moreover, others processes are identified as contributors of battery degradation like PVDF decomposition, structural changes of carbon black, and reduction of sulfur content on the bulk of the electrode. These new insights on the degradation processes may contribute to the further understanding, selection of materials, and improvement of this battery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, in the PL of SWCNTs, because the Stokes shift is small, the photon reabsorption effect is dominant and the apparent PL spectral shape and emission intensity are greatly modified depending on the concentration. This problem makes quantitative identification of SWCNTs by PL difficult. In this study, the concentration dependence of the PL of SWCNTs separated into a few chiralities was analyzed in detail, including the effect of reabsorption. It is clear that all changes in the PL spectrum occurring in the high concentration range can be explained simply by the reabsorption effect, and additional effects such as Coulomb interactions between SWCNTs can be negligible. Furthermore, a reliable quantum yield was derived from the emission intensity corrected for the reabsorption effect. The PL quantum yield varied with SWCNT chirality and exhibited a clear "family pattern". This is consistent with the theoretical report showing that the chirality-dependent PL quantum yield is dominated mainly by relaxation by optical phonons from E-22 to E-11.

As a result, there is much ambiguity in the scientific literature of measurements and numerical models that refer to BC with different names and based on different properties of the particles, with no clear definition of the terms. The authors present here a recommended terminology to clarify the terms used for BC in atmospheric research, with the goal of establishing unambiguous links between terms, targeted material properties and associated measurement techniques.

The mechanisms of the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (DSHP) on metal- free silicon and phosphorus dual- doped graphene (Si-P-G) catalyst, based on a dispersion- corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) method, are systematically investigated. The most stable Si-P-G catalyst is presented, with the local region of dopants shown to play an important role in the adsorption and reduction of oxygen. A two- electron pathway is probable for DSHP on Si-P-G according to kinetic and thermodynamic analyses.

The intermediate hydrochar was activated using different KOH/hydrochar weight ratios to evaluate the influence of these ratios on its electrochemical properties. The materials thus prepared exhibited high specific surface areas in the range 1290-1660 m(2) g(-1) mainly attributed to the three-dimensional hierarchical texture made up of abundant micropores, small mesopores and macropores, and high electrical conductivity in the 4.0-5.4 S cm(-1) range. Consequently, the samples show high specific capacitance, superior rate performance and outstanding durability in three-electrode and two-electrode systems in 6 M KOH. The as assembled symmetric supercapacitor in an ionic liquid electrolyte system exhibits a superior energy density of 46.8 W h kg(-1) and a value of 22.9 W h kg(-1) is maintained even at an ultrahigh power density of 25 400 W kg(-1). These materials possessing excellent structural features are an ideal candidate for high performance supercapacitors.

An exquisite hierarchical heterogeneous structure of bimetal sulfide Sb2S3@FeS2 hollow nanorods embedded into a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix is fabricated by a concise two-step solvothermal method. The FeS2 interlayer expands in situ grow on the interface of hollow Sb2S3 nanorods within the nitrogen-doped graphene matrix, forming a delicate heterostructure. Such a well-designed architecture affords rapid Na+ diffusion and improves charge transfer at the heterointerfaces. Meanwhile, the strongly synergistic coupling interaction among the interior Sb2S3, interlayer FeS2, and external nitrogen-doped carbon matrix creates a stable nanostructure, which extremely accelerates the electronic/ion transport and effectively alleviates the volume expansion upon long cyclic performance. As a result, the composite, as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries, exhibits a superior rate capability of 537.9 mAh g(-1) at 10 A g(-1) and excellent cyclic stability with 85.7% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5 A g(-1). Based on the DFT calculation, the existing constructing heterojunction in this composite can not only optimize the electronic structure to enhance the conductivity but also favor the Na2S adsorption energy to accelerate the reaction kinetics. The outstanding electrochemical performance sheds light on the strategy by the rational design of hierarchical heterogeneous nanostructures for energy storage applications.

The desirable interfacial morphology and homogenous dispersion of SWNTs were achieved by strong pi-pi stacking and supramolecular shape-fitting interactions between the nanotube and the paddlewheel-shaped triptycene moieties in polymer matrix. Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) containing 2-15 wt% of as-purchased SWNTs (AP-SWNTs) were prepared and tested for their gas transport properties. While all MMMs showed greatly enhanced permeabilities with well-maintained selectivities, a nonlinear dependence of permeability on filler content was observed. Another series of MMMs with purified SWNTs (P-SWNTs) and acid-treated SWNT (A-SWNTs) were also prepared. The functionalized A-SWNT MMM exhibited the best separation performance at 2 wt% filler content among all MMMs, which can be attributed to the improved interfacial affinity with carboxylic acid functionalized surface of A-SWNTs.

Aimed at key issues such as low energy density of supercapacitors, {[Ag-3(BTC)(IM)].H2O}(n) (ABI) was synthesized using the hydrothermal method and nitrogen self-doped porous carbon ABIC-T was prepared using the one-step carbonization method. The electrochemical performances of ABIC-T in KOH and ASS-4.0 mixed electrolyte were investigated and the mechanism of mixed electrolyte reaction was clarified. The results indicated that the synthesized nitrogen self-doped porous carbon ABIC-750 has a spongy porous structure with specific surface area of 602 m(2)/g. At current density of 1.0 A/g, the specific capacitance of ABIC-750 in KOH (6 M) was 142.2 F/g and its capacitance retention after 5000 cycles was 91.05%. At current density of 1.0 A/g, the specific capacitance of ABIC-750 was 817.1 F/g in the ASS-4.0 mixed electrolyte. In other words, the energy density of ABIC-750 in the ASS-4.0 mixed electrolyte was 5.75 times of that in KOH (6 M). This can be attributed to the Faradaic pseudocapacitance developed by redox reactions of sodium alizarinsulfonate in the mixed electrolyte.

The resulted N-PC@Ag-MOF composites present high stability because of the strong interaction between N atoms of N-PC and Ag(+)ions of Ag-MOF. It was discovered that the electrodes modified with N-PC@Ag-MOF composites display much higher conductivity than the one modified with Ag-MOF. Especially, they provide stable and sharp electrochemical signals of solid-state AgBr at a low potential approaching zero (i.e., 0.02 V), which may aid to overcome the drawback of the traditional electroanalysis at high overpotentials with serious interferences from the samples background. More importantly, the yielded AgBr signals selectively decrease induced by cysteine (Cys) through the specific thiol-bromine replacement reactions that transfer AgBr into non-electroactive Ag-Cys. The proposed method facilitates the selective detection of Cys with two linear working ranges of 0.10 to 100 mu M and 100 to 1300 mu M, respectively. The N-PC@Ag-MOF-based sensors have been used for detection of spiked Cys in milk samples with good recovery efficiencies. The developed electroanalysis strategy for probing Cys through the specific thiol-bromine replacement has potential applications in the food analysis fields.

Herein, programmed stimuli-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-carbon dot (PNIPAM-CD) hybrid nanogels are designed to address the abovementioned conflicts. The enlarged particle size of PNIPAM-CDs enables one to effectively improve their accumulation at tumor sites. Once the hybrid nanogels are docked in tumors and exposed to deep-red-light (660 nm) irradiation, heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated from the CDs, consequently activating photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) effects and meanwhile inducing partial degradation of PNIPAM-CDs for deep tissue penetration. Further, enhanced cellular internalization of the functional components can be achieved owing to the pH-responsive charge reversal and temperature-dependent hydrophilic/hydrophobic conversion characteristics of PNIPAM-CDs. Finally, the overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells would trigger further cleavage of the partially degraded hybrid nanogels, which is beneficial for their rapid clearance from the body. This work not only proposed a novel strategy to fabricate nanotheranostic agents using just a single functional component (i.e., the versatile CDs) to simplify the preparation process but also achieved effective delivery of agents into tumor cells by overcoming the multiple biological barriers to enhance therapeutic efficacy and decrease side effects.

A molecular dynamics study of the Si-nanowire@carbon-nanotube nanocomposite with sp(3) interfacial bonding	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article						Carbon nanotube; Si nanowires; Mechanical properties; Molecular dynamics simulations	STRUCTURAL-PROPERTIES; YOUNGS MODULUS	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to study the mechanical properties of nanocomposite of carbon nanotube (CNT) encapsulating a Si-16-fullerene-linked nanowires (Si16NW). It is found that Si16NW is not coaxial with CNT. Instead, it is adsorbed and hence closer to one side of the internal wall of CNT by forming strong sp(3) bonds. These sp(3) bonds can greatly enhance the limit of CNT against torsional and bending deformation. Due to the protection of CNT, the encapsulated Si16NW can maintain its configuration at relatively high torsional angle. The axial Young's modulus of the freestanding Si16NW is found to be more than that of bulk Si and much larger than that of the Si nanowires of similar size. Furthermore, the interfacial sp(3) bonds resulted in a strong enhancement of axial maximum strength of encapsulated Si16NW. However, it is interesting that filling Si16NW into (13,0) CNT does not enhance the axial tensile strength and elastic modulus of the host CNT. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, K.

Representative volume elements for discontinuous carbon fibre composites - Part 2: Determining the critical size	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Carbon fibres; Short-fibre composites; Finite element analysis; Representative volume element	ELASTIC PROPERTIES	This is the second part in a series of papers investigating the size of representative volume elements for discontinuous carbon fibre composites. An 'embedded cell' finite element approach, outlined in Part 1, has been used to determine critical RVE sizes for materials with increasing fibre lengths and fibre volume fractions. Convergence of the results for mechanical properties were seen at RVE edge lengths of four times the fibre length (a/L = 4), irrespective of the fibre volume fraction. The calculated Poisson's ratios (nu(12) and nu(21)) were largely independent of the RVE size. The critical RVE size is seen to be dependent on deterministic size effects and statistical size effects. Deterministic size effects are dominant for RVE sizes smaller than a/L = 4 because of the presence of bridging fibres. Statistical size effects beyond a/L = 4 were seen to be principally dependant on the level of fibre homogeneity and the departure from isotropy within the RVE, and these aspects were evaluated. An analytical model has been used to extrapolate the variance data to understand the most computationally efficient way of determining the critical RVE size. This study confirmed that it is more efficient to test fewer larger models than many smaller models, for the same level of statistical confidence (95%). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

High electrical currents generate joule heating and then cause breakdown of the BP in the air at over 400 degrees C due to rapid oxidation. In the vacuum, electrical resistive heating can generate temperatures of more than 2000 degrees C for the samples. Structural changes of SWCNTs after electrical current heating were observed using electron microscopy and Raman spectra. After breakdown of BP, the disorder-induced D-band increased and a smaller diameter related radial-breathing mode was reduced in the high temperature region. Structural transformations of SWCNT to other carbon nanostructures were observed after current-driven high-temperature treatment in the vacuum. In addition, surface-enhanced Raman scattering with intensity enhancement more than ten times was observed in the BP with agglomerated Fe or Ti particles. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The widespread occurrence of NPs may affect the fate of the coexisting pollutants and other types of NPs in natural waters. This study investigated the heteroadsorption of pollutants to multiple NPs in simulated water environment. Particular attention was paid to the impact of two common metal oxide (MO) NPs, Fe2O3 and ZnO, on the adsorption of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) to carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The results showed that the presence of Fe2O3 and ZnO significantly increased the time to reach adsorption equilibrium for the adsorption of E2 to CNTs. The adsorption amount of E2 increased with increasing Fe2O3/CNTs ratio due to the adsorption of E2 to Fe2O3. In contrast, E2 adsorption was slightly inhibited by the presence of ZnO, resulting from the blockage of the adsorption sites on CNT surface by ZnO. DLVO theory calculation exhibited that Fe2O3 were likely to first homoaggregate and then heteroaggregate with CNTs, whereas the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ZnO and CNTs favored their heteroaggregation in the heterogeneous systems of CNTs and ZnO. This was confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy images and the thermo-gravimetric analysis. The findings highlighted the significant effects of MO on the adsorption of organic compounds to CNTs, and also provided better understanding of the fate and transport of CNTs and organic contaminants in natural aquatic environments, where they inevitably coexist with MO.

Petroleum biomarkers (i.e., hopanes and steranes) were used to determine the fraction of fine particle organic carbon (OC) attributed to primary particles in MV exhaust. Source profiles obtained from a tunnel and from direct tailpipe emissions were applied to ambient measurements at locations ranging from rush hour traffic to a regional background site. The greatest amount of MV OC, 4.0 mu gC m(-3) out of 9.1 mu gC m(-3) or 43%, was observed 75 m south of a commuter highway during a period that included morning rush hour. Monthly estimates of MV-OC were determined for a downtown Toronto monitoring site for 2 years. Total OC concentrations were greater in the summer, due to secondary OC, but the amount of MV-OC did not exhibit a strong seasonal pattern. However, on a per cent basis, MV contributions from primary OC emissions were greatest in the winter (15-20%) and smallest in the summer (10-15%) with a two-year average of 14% of the OC or about 5% of the PM2.5.

In this work, a novel cell configuration with a top current collector was designed for Li2S based batteries. The nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) film was applied on top of the cathode, which serves not only as a top current collector but also as a barrier layer to effectively impede the polysulfide diffusion and enhance the utilization of active materials. A sheet-like Li2S@C nanocomposite was synthesized from low-cost and environmentally friendly raw materials of lithium sulfate (Li2SO4) and activated graphite. The as-prepared Li2S@C composites were directly used as cathode materials without adding any binder or carbon additive, which enabled a high Li2S loading up to 68% in the total cathode weight. The cells exhibited superior electrochemical performance. The specific energy at 0.5C was 804 W h kg(-1) based on the total electrode weight including the N-CNT top current collector, which is among the highest values demonstrated so far for sulfur and Li2S cathodes.

However, the slow reaction kinetics and insulating properties of sulfur, and dissolution of sodium polysulfides seriously inhibit their practical applications. In this work, a nitrogen-self-doped porous carbon (NPC) sheet is prepared through facile self-assembly, followed by a pyrolysis/activation process, in which polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) simultaneously acts as a carbon and nitrogen source. Benefiting from the large specific surface area, abundant micro/nanoporous structure, and nitrogen-self-doping, the obtained NPC sheets can significantly boost space confinement for sulfur molecules and effectively alleviate the dissolution of sodium polysulfides during the charge-discharge process in RT Na-S batteries. As a result, the optimum sample (S@NPC-700) is used as the cathode of a RT Na-S battery, which delivers a specific capacity of 280.9 mA h g(-1) (at 2.0C) and maintains a reversible capacity of 418.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C after 400 cycles. The superior performance of the S@NPC-700 electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effect from the micro/nanoporosity of carbon sheets and nitrogen-self-doping.

Based on ethanolic solution precipitation method, the powders of PA6, PA6/GO-0.5 and PA6/GO-1.0 were fabricated and dispersed uniformly into epoxy resins at varying loadings. The surface modification of GO and mechanical properties of epoxy composites were investigated systematically. The mechanical tests indicate that, without impairing tensile properties and glass transition temperature, the fracture toughness of PA6/G0-1.0 particles reinforced epoxy composites exhibits a 52.6% increase compared with neat epoxy at 1.5 wt% loading. Based on adequate fractographic study, the excellent toughening effect of PA6/GO-1.0 can be attributed to the better particle/matrix interface, rougher interface with small convex structures and more energy consumption of particle fracturing, which are resulted from the existence of PA6 chains grafted GO nanosheets. Moreover, the addition of GO and PA6 is 0.015 and 1.5 wt% respectively for the maximum fracture toughness value in this work. The dosage is very small compared with epoxy reinforced with GO or PA6 separately, giving an economically feasible method for the toughening of epoxy resin.

This graft copolymer can serve as an effective dispersing agent for multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and offers excellent dispersion performance. The primary focus of this investigation was the dispersing behavior of the graft copolymer and the optimization of the ratio between SAS and MWCNTs. For comparisons, poly(St-SSS) (SS) and poly(St-APEG) (SA) were, respectively, synthesized under the same conditions. The structures of SAS, SS, and SA were characterized via Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The morphologies of corn starch and modified corn starch were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while the crystal form of the starch before and after this modification reaction was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, the morphology of the dispersed MWCNTs was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the dispersion properties and the optimum mass ratio between SAS and MWCNTs were analyzed by zeta potential measurements and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectroscopy. It was found that the SAS was more effective in decreasing the aggregative tendency of MWCNTs in water than SS and SA.

Bare SnO2 SMCs, as well as bare commercial SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs), show very high initial discharge capacity when used as anode material for lithium-ion batteries. However, during the following cycles most of the Li ions previously inserted cannot be extracted, resulting in considerable irreversibility. Porous SnO2 cubes have been proven to possess better electrochemical performance than the dense nanoparticles. After being encapsulated by carbon shell, the obtained yolk-shell SnO2 SMCs@C exhibits significantly enhanced reversibility for lithium-ions storage. The reversibility of the conversion between SnO2 and Sn, which is largely responsible for the enhanced capacity, has been discussed. The porous SnO2 SMCs@C shows much increased capacity and cycling stability, demonstrating that the porous SnO2 core is essential for better lithium-ion storage performance. The strategy introduced in this paper can be used as a versatile way to fabrication of various metal-oxide-based composites.

Ultrafine Ni2P nanoparticles embedded in one-dimensional carbon skeleton derived from metal-organic frameworks template are obtained and used as LIBs anode electrode. The unique architecture of Ni2P@C electrode delivered a high capacity of 610.4 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 100 mA g(-1), excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability with no obvious capacity decay over 400 cycles at a high current of 500 mA g(-1), indicating the promising potential for LIBs application. Significantly, this design method of nanoparticles embedded in carbon skeleton may become a novel strategy for synthesizing other metal phosphides used as next generation LIBs anode materials.

However, the accompanying problems of ion/electron transport limitation and active materials shedding of the whole electrodes, especially for high-loaded electrode composed of nanoparticles with high specific surface area, bring down their comprehensive performance for practical applications. Here, this problem is solved with the as proposed "phase inversion" method, which allows fabrication of tricontinuous structured electrodes via a simple, convenient, low cost, and scalable process. During this process, the binder networks, electron paths, and ion channels can be separately interconnected, which simultaneously achieves excellent binding strength and ion/electron conductivity. This is verified by constructing electrodes with sulfur/carbon (S/C) and Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C (LVP/C) nanoparticles, separately delivering 869 mA h g(-1) at 1 C in Li-S batteries and 100 mA h g(-1) at 30 C in Li-LVP batteries, increasing by 26% and 66% compared with the traditional directly drying ones. Electrodes with 7 mg cm(-2) sulfur and 11 mg cm(-2) LVP can also be easily coated on aluminum foil, with excellent cycling stability. Phase inversion, as a universal method to achieve high-performance energy storage devices, might open a new area in the development of nanoparticlebased active materials.

A safe Li-Se battery in an ionic liquid-based electrolyte operating at 25-70 degrees C by using a N,S,O tri-doped mesoporous carbon host material	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; CATHODE MATERIALS; RENEWABLE ENERGY; POROUS CARBON; SELENIUM; GRAPHENE; TRANSFORMATION; COMPOSITES; MECHANISM	The selenium cathode for lithium-selenium batteries (Li-Se) has recently been recognized as an appealing high-energy alternative to sulfur due to its superior conductivity and chemical stability. These features open new possibilities such as alternative electrolytes that are known to be incompatible with a sulfur environment. In this work, we introduce a Li-Se battery comprising the non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte (N-propyl-N-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonylimide)) which allows the battery to operate stably from room temperature to up 70 degrees C. A N,S,O tri-doped mesoporous carbon is employed as a porous conductive network to host the selenium. At room temperature, the Li-Se battery shows capacity retention of 91% at 1C-rate after 100 cycles and can deliver a capacity up to 560 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C. Due to the tailored electrolyte, the battery operates well at 70 degrees C, where capacity of 670 mA h g(-1) is obtained at 0.25C and 94% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5C-rate. Thus we demonstrate for the first time the compatibility of the ionic liquid electrolyte against selenium in a Li-Se battery for large scale energy storage applications.

The utilization of stable and conductive hollow structures for electrode composite materials could make the desired performances possible in the future. Thus, in this study, a hollow structured Ni-CoSe2 embedded in N-doped amorphous carbon nanocomposite (Ni-CoSe2@NC) has been successfully synthesized with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors. Such strategy integrates both the merits of the multicomponents and the hollow structure; the latter could facilitate both mass and charge transport, and the former (the N-doped carbon) could not only offer plenty of surface defects, improving the surface capacitive contributions, but also stabilize the electrode structure during the charge/discharge processes. As a result, the metal selenide composite delivers outstanding high-rate properties with good stability as the anode for LIBs. The structure and components design could also be extended to other anode composites in the future.

J	Hu, JY; Wang, SY; Lu, YY; Li, S				Hu, Jiyue; Wang, Siyu; Lu, Yiyan; Li, Shan			Electrochemical noise analysis of cathodically protected steel reinforcement in concrete using carbon fiber sheet as anode	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Corrosion; Cathodic protection; Carbon fiber sheet; Electrochemical noise	CORROSION BEHAVIOR; PITTING CORROSION; CEMENT MORTAR; INITIATION; REMOVAL	This paper presents an efficiency and mechanism analysis of impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) for corroded steel reinforcements in concrete by means of electrochemical noise (EN), which is an advanced technique that allows real-time monitoring without any disturbance. The considered variables include protection method (non-protection, ICCP) and current density of ICCP (30 mA/m2, 90 mA/m2). In the cases of ICCP, carbon fiber sheet is adopted as the anode thanks to its good electrochemical properties and durability. Electrochemical potential noise (EPN) and electrochemical current noise (ECN) of steel reinforcement in concrete are measured every 30 d during the 120-d exposure period and analyzed from the perspectives of time and frequency domains. The results show that ICCP treatment with a current density of 30 mA/m2 leads to slighter fluctuations in ECN signals, an improvement in noise resistance Rn, and decreases in the low frequency plateau WL in power density diagram (PSD) of ECN signals. It indicates that the corrosion of steel is alleviated. However, the results of the specimen protected with a current density of 90 mA/m2 are the opposite, which is overprotected and hydrogen corrosion may happen. Compared to the specimen with no protection, the specimen treated with 30 mA/m2 ICCP shows an evident increase in energy proportion of d1-d3 wavelet crystals. Additionally, with increasing the treatment duration, the energy proportion of d1-d3 wavelet crystals increases. This illustrates that ICCP is more effective in inhibiting general corrosion than pitting corrosion. Extra caution should be paid to EPN signals of specimens subjected to ICCP, namely polarization, because EPN signals may anomalously exhibit severer fluctuations as a result of insufficient depolarization.

Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the influence of carburizing atmosphere on the structure and properties of the prepared tungsten carbide material. Here, using ammonium metatungstate as the tungsten source and activated carbon (AC) as the matrix, under different carburizing atmospheres, a tungsten carbide-activated carbon (WC-AC) composite support was prepared through in-situ reduction and carbonization technology. After further loading cobalt (Co) and cerium (Ce), a series of Co-Ce/WC-AC catalysts were prepared. The catalytic performance for dry reforming was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) and Thermogravimetric (TG) were used to characterize the crystal phase, microstructure and chemical composition of different samples. The results show that the main component of tungsten carbide prepared in a carburizing atmosphere containing CH4 was bitungsten carbide (W2C); tungsten carbide prepared in a pure hydrogen carburizing atmosphere was composed of W2C and WC. After loading Co and Ce, the catalytic activity and stability of catalysts containing WC are significantly improved compared with those mainly containing W2C. Due to the presence of WC, the interaction between the metal and the carrier was enhanced, thereby improving the dispersibility and oxidation resistance of the active component Co species. At the same time, WC was helpful to transform Co3+ to Co2+ and Ce4+ to Ce3+ on the surface and inner of catalyst, which was conducive to the enrichment of chemically adsorbed oxygen on the catalyst surface and the formation of oxygen vacancies. It promoted the adsorption and activation of CO2, and improved the anti-carbon deposition performance of the catalyst.

However, the shuttle effect issue, caused by polyselenide dissolution from the Se cathode, has hampered the development of Li-Se batteries. Herein, we developed a facile preparation of porous carbon from a metal-organic framework (MOF) to confine Se (Se/CZIF) and protect the Se/CZIF composite with an alucone coating by molecular layer deposition (MLD). The optimal alucone coated Se/CZIF cathode prepared exhibits a one-step reversible charge/discharge process in the carbonate electrolytes. The inhibition of polyselenide dissolution is credited with the improved electrochemical performance, formation of thin and stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers, and a reduction in charge transfer resistance, thus improving the overall performance of Li-Se batteries.

J	Kumar, A				Kumar, Ankit			Expertise, legitimacy and subjectivity: Three techniques for a will to govern low carbon energy projects in India	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE			English	Article						Trusteeship; politics; governmentality; energy access; development; India		This paper advances the understanding of the politics of governing energy for development projects by non-state actors. Building on Tania Murray Li's work on trusteeship, and drawing on governmentality studies, along with ethnographic insights from two low carbon energy projects, this paper illuminates two less examined aspects of politics of energy projects. First, the designs of these projects embed particular imagined subjects, and specific techniques, to afford governance. In particular, trustees use techniques of expertise, techniques of legitimacy, and techniques of subjectivity. Second, trusteeship is a contingent phenomenon as a clear line between trustees and subjects is often missing. Many actors, simultaneously trustees and subjects, also carry socio-cultural subjectivities of class, caste and gender, which complicates the conduct of conduct. Some trustees look for benefiting people, some for profits, some to make a political career and, yet others, to support their social groups. By engaging with trusteeship, the paper flags that the governance techniques do not always benefit the 'beneficiaries' and are often counterproductive. The article emerges from nine-month ethnographic research done in 2012-13 in five villages in India using participant observations, interviews and group discussion, in addition to analysis of project websites and documentary materials.

However, the effects of different straw return modes on soil aggregation and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in different water-stable aggregates have not been extensively investigated in these cropping systems. The objective of this study was to quantify the long-term (7 yr) impact of C input on the SOC content of four soil aggregate size classes (large macroaggregates; small macroaggregates; microaggregates, silt plus clay fraction) and in explicit SOC fractions (free light fraction, free LF; intra-aggregate particulate organic matter, iPOM; mineral-associated matter, mSOM) within the top 40 cm of soil in a wheat-maize double cropping system in Northwest China. Four treatments were examined: (i) no return (control); (ii) return of wheat straw only (WR); (iii) return of maize straw only (MR); and (iV) return of both maize and wheat straw (MR-WR). Over the experimental period, the change in SOC under the four treatments ranged from -0.96 to 5.83 Mg ha(-1) and a significant linear relationship between SOC change and cumulative C input (R-2 = 0.9882, P < 0.05) was observed. Relative to the control, the proportion of large and small macro aggregates in the 0-20 cm soil layer increased the most in MR-WR (32% and 24%), followed by MR (22% and 13%), and WR (11% and 10%). Straw return significantly increased the SOC content in each soil aggregate size class relative to no straw return. The order of SOC fractions with respect to SOC content was mSOM > fine iPOM > coarse iPOM > free LF. Straw return significantly increased the C stock in iPOM and mSOM relative to the control. Coarse iPOM was the most sensitive indicator of C change and mSOM was the main form of SOC under long-term straw return. A significant linear relationship existed between cumulative C input and the mass proportion of macroaggregates as well as the C content of SOC fractions (or aggregate fractions). Soil depth had a significant influence on almost all measurements, with greater values observed in the 0-20 cm layer than in the 20-40 cm layer. Overall, return of both maize and wheat straw was the best strategy for improving soil structure, soil organic carbon, and crop yield. However, straw return from one crop was sufficient to maintain initial SOC levels, and conserved straw could be used for cellulosic feedstocks.

Aiming at an optimal preparation strategy the structure and conductivity upon different mechanical milling times is investigated. Li6PS5Cl material with high ionic conductivity of 1.1.10(-3) S/cm was obtained by milling for 8 hours at 550 rpm followed by a heat-treatment at 550 degrees C. All solid-state Li-S batteries were assembled, combining the Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, with a carbon-sulfur mixture as positive electrode and Li, Li-Al and Li-In as negative electrode. An optimum charge/discharge voltage window between 0.4 and 3.0 V vs. Li-In was obtained by CV experiments and galvanostatic cycling displays a very large capacity around 1400 mAh/g during the first cycles, decreasing below 400 mAh/g after 20 cycles. Impedance spectroscopy suggests that the origin of the capacity fading is related to an increasing electrode-electrolyte interface resistance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The influence of factors, such as activation time (3-15 min), KOH/C ratio (1:1-6:1) and particle size (0.147-2 mm) on its performance (the carbon yield and adsorptive capability) were investigated. The textural porosity and surface chemistry of HP-AC were determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyzer, N-2 adsorption method and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. The adsorptive properties of HP-AC were examined using iodine solution and methylene blue as model dye compound and hydrogen adsorbate. The effect of porosity and surface functionalities on the electrochemical capacitance of HP-AC were measured by cyclic voltammetry measurements. Under the best preparation conditions (activation time of 8 min, KOH/C ratio of 5: 1 and particle size of 0.71-1.4 mm), the following results were obtained for the specific surface area, micro surface area, external surface area, total pore volume, iodine adsorption value, methylene blue adsorption value, carbon yield, hydrogen storage capacity and super capacitance value: 2,446 m(2)/g, 901 m(2)/g, 1,545 m(2)/g, 1.48 mL/g, 2,226 mg/g, 47.5 mL/0.1 g, 34.3%, 0.93 wt% (17.3 MPa, 25 degrees C) and 3.63 wt% (1.0 MPa, -196 degrees C), 212 F/g, respectively. The findings revealed the potential of BC as a raw material for the preparation of HP-AC, and to determine its potential applications of HP-AC as hydrogen storage and super-capacitor material.

The results showed the total extracted chloride contents of samples treated with different anodes had an order of Cs > Cm > Cp. The distribution of anodic reaction products indicated that only a small part of Cs played as anode because of the insulation in its transverse direction while Cm performed better conductivity uniformity and accordingly higher usage. With the increase of current density, the extracted chloride content improved, but the improvement was very limited when the current density kept rising. The incorporation of fly ash led to 12%-153.1% improvement in extracted chlorides. After ECE, the measured residual free chloride content in concrete did not change with current density or fly ash content, except for the cases when current density was increased from 0 to 1 A/m2. The additional extracted chlorides with increasing current density or fly ash content can be attributed to the dissolution of bound chlorides. The contribution of increasing compactness by adding fly ash was offset by the destruction of Friedel's salt and the resulting release of chloride ions in the alkali environment and under the impressed currents.

J	Liao, K; Li, S				Liao, K; Li, S			Interfacial characteristics of a carbon nanotube-polystyrene composite system	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							STRESS	The performance of a composite material system is critically controlled by the interfacial characteristics of the reinforcement and the matrix material. Here we report a study on the interfacial characteristics of a carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced polystyrene (PS) composite system through molecular mechanics simulations and elasticity calculations. In the absence of atomic bonding between the reinforcement and the matrix material, it is found that the nonbond interactions consists of electrostatic and van der Waals interaction, deformation induced by these forces, as well as stress/deformation arising from mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion. All of these contribute to the interfacial stress transfer ability, the critical parameter controlling material performance. Results of a CNT pullout simulation suggests that the interfacial shear stress of the CNT-PS system is about 160 MPa, significantly higher than most carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite systems.

Both the atomic electronegativity interaction vector (AEIV) and the atomic hybridization state index (AHSI) are used for the expression of local chemical microenvironment and atomic hybridization state of 4434 resonance carbon atoms in 203 steroid molecules. A multiple linear regression (MLR) model is built after screening some insignificant parameters with the stepwise multiple regression (SMR) technique. Correlation coefficients of the developed model are R-cum(2) = 0.9341 and Q(LOO)(2) = 0.9336 for classical estimation of molecular modeling and the cross-validation with leave-one-out (LOO) procedures, respectively, primarily indicating that the MLR model has good modeling stability and prediction ability. Furthermore, the superior performance of the MLR model is tested by the leave-33%-out (L33%O) cross-validation method, where the mean correlation coefficients of three test sets are Q(2) = 0.9310 and Q(ext)(2) = 0.9196 for both internal and external sets. In conclusion, AEIV and AHSI descriptors can be used for estimating and predicting C-13 NNIR chemical shifts of steroids. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A method of quantifying the inhomogeneous alignment of macroscopic CNTNs is explored based on bulk property measurements of their electrical anisotropy and X-ray diffraction diagrams. The results show that the process of stretch-induced alignment of CNTNs included straightening the waviness of the long nanotube ropes, as well as the self-assembling and denser packing of the nanotubes. For samples at a strain of 40%, the fraction of aligned nanotubes was as high as 0.85. The aligned fraction of CNTs serves as an important parameter for the quality control of the alignment process and numerical simulations of structure-property relationships of CNTNs and their composites.

Organic carbon density and storage of the major black soil regions in Northeast China	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article						Black soil; organic carbon density and storage; arable layer; Northeast China	SEQUESTRATION; FERTILIZER	Black soils in the Northeast Plain of China are characterized by high organic carbon (C) density and storage, which can influence C sequestration in local cropland ecosystems. Using GIS, this study analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution and variation of cropland organic C density and storage in the arable layer (0-20 cm) of the major black soil regions in China's Northeast Plain (specifically across the study region of Hailun, Shuangcheng and Gongzhuling counties) over the past 30 years. The results indicate an overall downward trend in soil organic C (SOC) density (SOCd, mean decrease of 0.64 kg m(-2)) and storage (SOCs, decrease of 4.65 Tg)(*1) for the major black soil regions tested during the study period. The mean decrease in SOCd for Hailun, Shuangcheng and Gongzhuling counties was 0.68 kg m(-2), 0.18 kg m(-2) and 1.05 kg m(-2), respectively, with total SOC decreases of 2.30 Tg, 0.49 Tg and 1.86 Tg, respectively. SOCd decreased to a greater extent during the first twenty years in Hailun and Shuangcheng relative to Gongzhuling. Moreover, SOCd tended to stabilize and then slightly increase during the last ten years. There was a downward trend in SOCd and SOCs over the past 30 years for almost all soil types, but the most serious decline in SOCs was observed in black soils, which account for 57.92% of the cropland soil area in all study regions and which lost up to 2.91 Tg of SOC. Therefore, the major black soil region in Northeast China was presenting a C resource trend over the past 20-30 years.	[Li, H.; Wang, J. K.; Li, S.

The MIL-101(Fe)-NH2 support possessed, a large surface area, close to 3500 m(2) g(-1), and mild framework stability up to 120 degrees C. As the framework stability strongly depends on the presence of guests in the micro/mesoporous cages, conditions for sulphur inclusion process were carefully selected, and then the material was further carbonized. MOF as a conductive part of cathode material displayed successful sulphur capture and encapsulation. The encapsulation of sulphur was accompanied by highly stable charge/discharge cycle performances and high efficiency. Consequently, the cathode showed at a current rate 0.5C a high initial discharge capacity of 705 mA h g(-1) and after 200 cycles of 476 mA h g(-1), corresponding to a low fading rate of 0.162% per cycle. The capacity of the cycle after self-discharge was 94.8% of the capacity in the cycle before self-discharge. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Capkova, D.; Fedorkova, A.

A column packed with PGC (porous graphitic carbon) was used after preliminary experiments had shown that silica- and bonded-phase (silica-based) stationary phases were unsatisfactory for separation. The PGC column exhibited unique selectivity for the complexes studied. The mobile phases used were water-acetonitrile, dichloromethane-hexane and tetrahydrofuran-hexane. The retention behaviour of the compounds was governed by the polar character and size of molecules, and influenced by metal-metal bond polarity. Separation of isomorphous structures with different metallocenyl moieties was achieved.

The initial cellulose substance (filter paper) was first carbonized at 450 degrees C, and then treated by KOH at 800 degrees C to acquire the activated carbon fibres; thereafter, the CoS nanoparticles were deposited onto the activated carbon fibres through a hydrothermal process. Such a porous three-dimensional network structure of the resultant CoS/carbon nanofibrous material inherited from the original cellulose substance resulted in high lithium ion diffusion coefficient, fast electronic transport and fine pseudo-capacitive effect. The composite with 37.0 wt% of cobalt sulfide displayed a high initial specific capacity of 1137.3 mA h g(-1) and a stable reversible capacity of 576.7 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). Owing to the high specific surface area and porous structure of the CoS-nanoparticle/carbon nanofibrous composite, it delivered superior electrochemical performance during the lithiation/delithiation progress when used as an anodic material for lithium-ion batteries.

The full soil profile is a highly dynamic component of the ecosystem, with pronounced depth-dependent processing of soil organic carbon (SOC) such that accumulations and losses of carbon above ground are on different temporal trajectories than changes below ground. But many studies do not consider the spatial variability of soil properties in the vertical direction, especially in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, mainly because of the difficulties and expense of collecting soil material in that kind of terrain and transporting it to the laboratory. Visible near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (Vis-NIR) is an increasingly popular measurement method that is enabling the rapid, real-time and accurate proximal sensing of soil properties, including SOC. However, the soil moisture content has been shown to affect soil spectra, might mask or alter the absorption features of SOC. EPO and PDS are two effective methods to correct soil spectra effects, but we still unknow the feasibility of those two methods on fresh profile samples. In this study, we compared EPO and PDS on a set of 26 soil cores (1 m depths and 5 cm diameter) in the Sygera Mountains on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Spectra were acquired from fresh, vertical faces 5 cmx5 cm in the area from the centers of the cores to give 386 spectra in all. We also got the spectra and SOC contents from the 386 dry samples. The statistical models were built to predict of the SOC in the samples from the spectra by Random Forest. The bootstrap was used to assess the uncertainty of the predictions by the EPO and PDS. Our results show that PDS is an effective strategy to mitigate the effects of soil water content on vis-NIR spectra for the fresh soil core samples from arable and grassland. While EPO neither shown significantly out performed those wet core samples from grassland. There were somewhat differences along with the profile on prediction accuracy of SOC between EPO and PDS. Both EPO and PDS show significantly available on surface layers of samples from arable and grassland. The EPO and PDS illustrated the dependence of land use type and soil depth. Our work would be a benefit to therapid and accurate estimation of the vertical partitioning of SOC content in the field in alpine mountains using Vis-NIR spectroscopy.

Compared to the previous work, the SiO2 nanosphere templates used in this work are more well-ordered and size-controlled, which increases the surface area of the Fe-N-C framework material. We observed that the 30nm@Fe-N-C sample exhibits orderly arranged mesopores, interconnected conductive networks, and large surface area (1192m(2)g(-1)). Moreover, the 30nm@Fe-N-C sample shows significantly enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity compared to commercial Pt/C. A more-positive half-wave potential of 0.84V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and remarkably stable limiting current of approximate to 6.1mAcm(-2) is demonstrated by a three-electrode configuration rotating disk electrode (RDE) system in 0.1m KOH solution. An AEMFC based on the 30nm@Fe-N-C sample showed a maximum power density of 100mWm(-2) at a high current density of 230mAcm(-2). In addition, we found the AEMFC based on 30nm@Fe-N-C catalyst could steadily operate for more than 60h with only 4.65% performance degradation under constant voltage conditions (0.6V). More interestingly, this catalyst shows an excellent tolerance for CO as well as remarkably long-term stability with more than 89.9% retention of its initial activity after 41.6min operation, which is obviously superior to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (59% initial activity retention).

However, the notorious shuttle effect, caused by the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides during cycling, limits the long-term performance of Na-S batteries. In this study, intrinsically microporous Tro center dot ger's base based polymer (PIM-EA-TB)-based carbon-sulfur composites are prepared for shuttle-effect-free RT Na-S batteries by utilizing the combination of physical confinement and covalent bonding in a single material. The composites demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance, including a negligible capacity fading over 350 cycles and a high coulombic efficiency of approximately greater than 99%.

Investigations of temperature influence revealed a positive temperature dependence of capacitance for OLC-based supercapacitors and a weak dependence of capacitance on temperature for CNT-based supercapacitors, in line with experimental observations. Molecular insights into RTIL-based supercapacitors, reviewed in this Perspective, could facilitate the design and development of a new generation of energy storage devices.

We used in situ X-ray reflectivity (XR) to determine the EDL structure at static potentials, during cyclic voltammetry (CV) and potential step measurements. The static potential structures were also investigated with fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Combined XR and MD results show that the EDL structure has alternating anion/cation layers within the first nanometer of the interface and that these structures are distinct at the most positive and negative static potentials (1.0 and -0.4 V, respectively) applied in this study. The dynamical response of the EDL to potential steps has a slow component (>10 s) and the RTIL structure shows hysteresis during CV scans (e.g., at 100 mV/s scan rate). Our results reveal that both the slow kinetics and hysteresis are due to the reorganization of the distinct EDL structures found at the extreme potentials.

Por/CoO/GO exhibits excellent peroxidase-like activity, which is evaluated by virtue of the chromogenic substrate 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). In the presence of H2O2, Por/CoO/ GO nanoperoxidase can rapidly catalyze colorless TMB to be oxidized into blue oxTMB, which is distinguished visually in 1 min. The experimental data including fluorescence and electrochemistry data and radical scavengers confirm that the catalytic mechanism of Por/CoO/GO is ascribed to electron transfer between substrates, as well as produced active species (h(+) and center dot O-2(-)). Based on Por/CoO/GO nanoperoxidase, a fast colorimetric sensor for H2O2 has been established for a wide range of concentrations (0.1-3 mM) with a lower limit of detection (LOD = 0.2942 mM). Notably, the blue color of oxTMB can be gradually faded in the presence of dopamine (DA) with various concentrations. Thus, a fast, cheap, and convenient colorimetric sensor has been designed to monitor DA in a wide range (0.2-10 mu M) with a much lower LOD (0.1391 mu M).

A unique two-dimensional morphology and high graphitization degree of carbon nanosheets benefits fast Li+/e(-) access to the active Se, which guarantees a high utilization of Se during the(de)lithiation process. Besides, the chain-like Se molecules confined in the carbon matrix could alleviate the shuttle effect of polyselenides and promise a stable electrochemistry. Therefore, the resultant Se/CNSs delivers a highly reversible capacity, a long cycle life and favorable rate capabilities. Furthermore, a Li-Se pouch cell built from a metallic Li anode and the as-prepared Se/CNSs cathode exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance, demonstrating the potential of Se/CNSs in serving future energy storage devices with high energy density.

For the hierarchical structure, the core section (Si/po-C) was composed of PVA-based porous carbon framework and the embedded Si nanoparticles, and the desired Si/po-C@C microspheres were formed by encapsulating the Si/po-C core with PAN-based carbon shell. The Si/po-C@C anode gave rise to stable cycling performances with high capacity and excellent rate capability attributed to the hierarchical structure. The compact PAN-based carbon shell was able to block electrolyte to contact with Si effectively, promoting the formation of stable solid-electrolyte interphase. The porous carbon framework could accommodate the volume change of embedded Si nanopartides and enhance the internal conductivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the study, GO is reduced by DA and DA is adhered to RGO by one-step pH-induced polymerization of DA (polydopamine, PDA), and then heparin or protein is grafted onto the PDA adhered RGO (pRGO) through catechol chemistry. The obtained pRGO, heparin grafted pRGO (Hep-g-pRGO), and BSA grafted pRGO (BSA-g-pRGO) exhibit fine 2D morphology and excellent stability in water and PBS solution. Furthermore, the biocompatibility of the biopolymer functionalized RGO are investigated using human blood cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The biopolymer functionalized RGO exhibits an ultralow hemolysis ratio (lower than 1.8%), and the cellular toxicity assay suggests that the biopolymer functionalized RGO has good cytocompatibility for HUVEC cells, even at a high concentration of 100 mu g mL(-1). Moreover, the high anticoagulant ability of Hep-g-pRGO indicates that the grafted biopolymer could maintain its biological activity after immobilization onto the surface of pRGO. Therefore, the proposed safe and green biomimetic method confers the biopolymer functionalized RGO with great potential for various biological and biomedical applications.

Increasing the electronic conductivity with electron pathways of cathode materials can effectively enhance the lithium storage properties with stable cyclability and rate capability theoretically. Here the MoO3-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid nanobelts were designed and prepared and were tested as cathode materials for lithium batteries. It is demonstrated that the rGO is wrinkled and twisted around MoO3 nanobelts after reacting under high temperature and pressure conditions. The unique morphology of rGO, which has continuous electron pathways and stress buffering effects, endows the MoO3-rGO hybrid nanobelts with significantly increased rate capability and cycling ability. Meanwhile, it is demonstrated that MoO3-rGO hybrid nanobelts are promising cathode materials for use in rechargeable lithium batteries and our synthesis strategy is also versatile for exploiting advanced materials for Li-ion batteries.

However, the coal or shale swelling during CO2 enhanced methane (CH4) production significantly reduces the gas injection and production rate. In this work, the CH4 and CO2 adsorption-induced deformation of carbon slit pores as representative of coal and shale nanopores was studied using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation. We focused on the strain difference by comparing the CO2 and CH4 adsorption-induced deformation of pores with various widths. The effect of each pore width on the bulk swelling was analyzed under different pressures and temperatures. The results showed that the strain difference between CO2 and CH4 at different conditions oscillates with a damped amplitude as the pore width increases, which can be positive or negative indicating pore swelling or contraction when CH4 is displaced by CO2. The maximum swelling occurs among the pores inaccessible to CH4 but accessible to CO2 molecules and the contracting pores contribute negatively to the bulk swelling. Furthermore, this study provided fundamental adsorption induced strain of each pore width for predicting the bulk deformation during CO2 enhanced CH4 production when the coal or shale pore size distribution is known.

Related to this, the effect of physical and mechanical activation on the physicochemical structure of coal-based ACs has been investigated in this work. In the stage of CO2 activation, the rapid decrease of the defective structure and the growth of aromatic layers accompanied by the dehydrogenation of aromatic rings result in the ordered conversion of the microstructure and severe carbon losses on the surfaces of Char-PA, while the oxygen content of Char-PA, including C=O (39.6%), C-O (27.3%), O-C=O (18.4%) and chemisorbed O (or H2O) (14.7%), is increased to 4.03%. Char-PA presents a relatively low S-BET value (414.78 m(2)/g) owing to the high value of Non-V-mic (58.33%). In the subsequent mechanical activation from 12 to 48 h under N-2 and dry ice, the strong mechanical collision caused by ball-milling can destroy the closely arranged crystalline layers and the collapse of mesopores and macropores, resulting in the disordered conversion of the microstructure and the formation of a defective structure, and a sustained increase in the S-BET value from 715.89 to 1259.74 m(2)/g can be found with the prolonging of the ball-milling time. There is a gradual increase in the oxygen content from 6.79 to 9.48% for Char-PA-CO2-12/48 obtained by ball-milling under CO2. Remarkably, the varieties of physicochemical parameters of Char-PA-CO2-12/48 are more obvious than those of Char-PA-N-2-12/48 under the same ball-milling time, which is related to the stronger solid-gas reactions caused by the mechanical collision under dry ice. Finally, the results of the SO2 adsorption test of typical samples indicate that Char-PA-CO2-48 with a desirable physicochemical structure can maintain 100% efficiency within 30 min and that its SO2 adsorption capacity can reach 138.5 mg/g at the end of the experiment. After the 10th cycle of thermal regeneration, Char-PA-CO2-48 still has a strong adsorptive capacity (81.2 mg/g).

However, the high-cost and low-efficiency differentiation of BMSCs into functional osteoblasts limits their clinical application. It is desirable to develop bioactive materials to integrate efficient differentiation and traceable properties in a biocompatible manner for MSC-based therapy. In this study, a new kind of bioactive carbon dot (CD) was facilely fabricated through a one-step hydrothermal method from adenosine and aspirin. These bioactive CDs were cytocompatible and biosafe with the capability of long-term fluorescent tracking of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Notably, the presence of bioactive CDs triggered and directed a series of events that followed the temporal pattern of osteogenic differentiation through the promotion of osteogenic transcription and enhancement of matrix mineralization. Moreover, cells with bioactive CDs exhibited more effective osteogenic differentiation behavior than cells treated with either adenosine or aspirin alone. Overall, these findings clearly showed that adenosine and aspirin based CDs can direct osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in the absence of any external osteoinductive factors. The unique properties of bioactive CDs could provide insight into their potential for achieving efficient and safe MSC-based therapy.

Differences in Electrochemistry between Fibrous SPAN and Fibrous S/C Cathodes Relevant to Cycle Stability and Capacity	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Li-SM3 Conference	APR 26-27, 2017	London, ENGLAND				LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; CARBONATE-BASED ELECTROLYTE; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; FLUOROETHYLENE CARBONATE; COMPOSITE CATHODES; CHEMISTRY; DISCHARGE; POROSITY	Two different Li/S cathodes are compared in terms of capacity (mA.h.g(sulfur)(-1)) and intermediates during discharge and charge. One cathode material is based on fibrous SPAN, a sulfur-containing material obtained via the thermal conversion of poly(acrylonitrile), PAN, in the presence of sulfur. In this material, sulfur is covalently bound to the polymeric backbone. The second cathode material is based on porous activated carbon fibers (ACFs) with elemental sulfur embedded inside the ACFs' micropores. Cyclic voltammetry clearly indicates different discharge and charge chemistry of the two materials. While S-containing ACFs show the expected redox-chemistry of sulfur, SPAN does not form long-chain polysulfides during discharge; instead, sulfide is chopped off the polymer-bound sulfur chains to directly form Li2S. The high reversibility of this process accounts for both the high cycle stability and capacity of SPAN-based cathode materials. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

ZnCl2 and H3PO4 were used as catalysts. Hydrothermal carbonization combined with pyrolysis were used to co-activate with the ultrasonic auxiliary impregnation method in order to prepare straw activated carbon (SAC). Methylene blue adsorption value and iodine value were used as the main evaluation index to optimize the process conditions. The activation process was analyzed and the optimum preparation conditions were obtained. The results showed that it was feasible to combine hydrothermal carbonization with ultrasonic assisted immersion pyrolysis using ZnCl2 and H3PO4 as catalysts for preparing SAC. WS , CS and SS showed similar characteristics in the preparation of SAC. The best preparation conditions of hydrothermal temperature and the impregnation ratio of ZnCl2 were 200 degrees C and 2:1. The optimum pyrolysis condition was at a heating rate of 5 degrees C/min and an impregnation ratio of H(3)PO(4 )equal to 2:1 with 1 h of pyrolysis at 500 degrees C. The temperature and time of ultrasonic auxiliary conditions were 40 degrees C and 30 min. For WSHUPC, CSHUPC and SSHUPC, the MB adsorption values were 165, 166 and 164 mg/g and the iodine values reached 764, 725 and 701 mg/g. It was demonstrated the three kinds of straws were highly efficient precursor for the preparation of activated carbon used to remove dyes from wastewater. The preparation method in this study combines the advantages of physical and chemical activation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Polysulfide catholyte as a recyclable liquid fuel was proven to enhance both the energy density and power density of the battery. However, a critical barrier with this lithium (LO/polysulfide battery is that the shuttle effect, which is the crossover of polysulfides and side deposition on the Li anode, becomes much more severe than that in conventional Li S batteries with a solidstate sulfur cathode. In this work, we successfully applied an acrylatebased gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) to the Li/polysulfide system. The GPE layer can effectively block the detrimental diffusion of polysulfides and protect the Li metal from the side passivation reaction. Cathode static batteries utilizing 2 M catholyte (areal sulfur loading of 6.4 mg cm(-2)) present superior cycling stability (727.4 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.2 C) and high rate capability (814 mAh g(-1) at 2 C) and power density (similar to 10 mW cm(-2)), which also possess replaceable and encapsulated merits for mobile devices. In the cathode-flow mode, the Li/polysulfide system with catholyte supplied from an external tank demonstrates further improved power density (similar to 59 mW cm(-2)) and stable cycling performance. This novel and simple Li/polysulfide system represents a significant advancement of high energy density sulfur-based batteries for future power sources.

Relationship between Carbon Isotope Discrimination, Mineral Content and Gas Exchange Parameters in Vegetative Organs of Wheat Grown under Three Different Water Regimes	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						ash content; bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L; ); carbon isotope discrimination; drought; transpiration efficiency	DRY-MATTER PRODUCTION; LEAF ASH CONTENT; GRAIN-YIELD; USE EFFICIENCY; SPRING WHEAT; DURUM-WHEAT; BREAD WHEAT; ACCUMULATION; SILICON; TRANSPORT	Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) has been proposed as an indirect selection criterion for transpiration efficiency and grain yield in wheat. However, because of high cost for Delta analysis, attempts have been made to identify alternative screening criteria. Ash content (m(a)) has been proposed as an alternative criterion for Delta in wheat and barley. A pot experiment was conducted to analyse the relationship between Delta, mineral content and gas exchange parameters in seedlings and leaves of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Plants of 10 genotypes were cultivated under three different water regimes corresponding to moderate (T-3), intermediate (T-2) and severe drought (T-1) stress obtained by maintaining soil humidity at 75 %, 55 % and 45 % of the humidity at field capacity respectively. Delta and m(a) in seedlings and leaves showed significant differences among the three water treatments. Significant positive correlations were found between Delta and m(a) in seedlings and leaves at elongation and anthesis stages in severe drought stress (T-1). Delta was negatively associated with potassium (K) content in intermediate drought stress (T-2) and positively with magnesium (Mg) content in T-2 and T-3 (moderate drought stress) in flag leaf at anthesis. There were negative correlations between Delta and single-leaf intrinsic water-use efficiency (W-T) in T-2 and T-3 at anthesis stage. Stronger positive associations were noted between Delta and stomatal conductance (g(s)) in T-1 and T-2 than in T-3 at anthesis. These results suggested that Delta is a good trait as an indirect selection criterion for genotypic improvement in transpiration efficiency, while m(a) is a possible alternative criterion of Delta in wheat vegetative organs, especially in stressed environments. Significant association was found between Delta and K, Mg and Ca contents that would merit being better investigated.

Compositing Polyetherimide with Polyfluorene Wrapped Carbon Nanotubes for Enhanced Interfacial Interaction and Conductivity	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						polyetherimide (PEI); poly(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO); multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs); uniform dispersion; interfacial interaction; conductivity	SELECTIVE DISPERSION; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; FUNCTIONALIZATION; NANOCOMPOSITES; NONCOVALENT; POLYIMIDE; REINFORCEMENT; MORPHOLOGY; PHASE; FILMS	A novel approach to chemically functionalize multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for making superior polyetherimide (PEI) nanocomposites with polyfluorene polymer is presented. In this approach, MWCNTs are non-covalently functionalized with poly(9,9-dioctyfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO) through pi-pi stacking as confirmed by UV-vis, fluorescence, and Raman spectra. Atomic force microscopy as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy shows the PFO coated MWCNTs, which provides excellent dispersion of the latter in both solvent and PEI matrix. The strong interaction of PFO with PEI chains, as evidenced from fluorescence spectra, supports the good adhesion of dispersed MWCNTs to PEI leading to stronger interfacial interactions. As a result, the addition of as little as 0.25 wt % of modified MWCNTs to PEI matrix can strongly improve the mechanical properties of the composite (increase of 46% in storage modulus). Increasing the amount of MWCNTs to 2.0 wt % (0.5 wt % PFO loading) affords a great increase of 119% in storage modulus. Furthermore, a sharp decrease of 12 orders of magnitude in volume resistivity of PEI composite is obtained with only 0.5 wt % of PFO modified MWCNT.

When they enter water body, serious environmental problems and damage to the human body are always generated. Herein, an electroactive composite membrane was facilely prepared by uniformly deposition of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) nanoparticles on the surface and inner wall of coal-based tubular carbon membrane (CTCM) for rapid and selective separation of Cs+ from wastewater. This NiHCF incorporated CTCM tube exhibited an extremely high removal rate (over 99.99%) over a long period. Meanwhile, it also demonstrated extreme Cs+ selectivities even in the solutions with high coexisting ion concentrations (e.g., Cs+:Na+ = 1:99, Cs+:K+ = 1:99). The rapid and selective Cs+ uptake/release should be attributed to the better dispersion of NiHCF nanoparticles with high selectivity to Cs+ in the CTCM tube, which reduced the mass transfer distance, increased fluid turbulence and accelerated mass transfer rate. It is expected that such a NiHCF incorporated CTCM tube could be a promising alternative of conventional materials for the separating of radioactive Cs+ ions.

Herein, bifunctional and elastic carbon nanotube (CNT) aerogel is fabricated to combine with Te nanowires, yielding two types of binder/collector-free Te cathodes to assemble Li-Te batteries. The CNTs with high electronic conductivity and hollow porous structure enable stable electric contact and fast transportation of Li+, while trapping Te and Li2Te in its network, triggering fast and stable Li-Te electrochemistry. Both cathodes are also provided with fine compressibility, helping to buffer their volume changes during lithiation/delithiation and improving electrode integrity. Both cathodes deliver high specific capacity, fine cycling stability, and favorable high-rate capability, proving their competence in building high-energy rechargeable Li-ion batteries.

Results showed that C-ion radiation statistically inhibited clonogenic survival capacity of B16F10 melanoma cells. The RBE was 3.7 at D-10 levels, meaning 1.0 Gy C-ion should cause the same biological effect as >= 3.0 Gy X-rays. In addition, we also observed a stronger proliferation-inhibiting and higher ratio of cell apoptosis and necrosis in B16F10 cells treated with C-ion than X-rays. Moreover, C-ion radiation exhibited stronger and long-lasting G2/M arrest than X-rays. As an underlying mechanism, we speculated that C-ion radiation-induced G2/M block through activating pRb/E2F1/Chk2 pathway. With these results, we highlighted the potential of C-ion in treatment of cutaneous melanoma. Further, in vitro experiments as well as clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the effect of carbon ion radiotherapy in melanoma.

Development of a novel two-stage powdered activated carbon-dynamic membrane filtration (PAC-DMF) system for direct physicochemical wastewater treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT			English	Article						Powdered activated carbon; Dynamic membrane; Wastewater direct filtration; Resource recovery; Membrane fouling	COAGULATION-MICROFILTRATION; SEWAGE PRECONCENTRATION; PERFORMANCE; RECOVERY; OPERATION; FLUX	Due to the issues of high energy consumption, high carbon emissions, and low resource and energy recovery, there is an urgent need to develop new paradigms for simultaneous wastewater treatment and resource utilization using physicochemical processes rather than conventional biological means. Recently, direct membrane filtration of municipal wastewater using ultrafiltration/microfiltration technology was proposed and showed satisfactory performance, with high membrane costs and fast membrane fouling as the main limitations. In this study, a novel two-stage powdered activated carbon-dynamic membrane filtration (PAC-DMF) system was developed using PAC as a carrier to enhance DM formation and organic pollutant retention. The particle size and dosage of PAC, strategy for operating the continuous reactor in the first stage, and selection of the PAC particle size in the second stage were investigated. The effluent from the first stage was found to have a stable water quality, with turbidity in the range of 50-70 NTU. Efficient retention of organic materials was also achieved with a retention rate of 74%-82%, and the COD content in the concentrate was above 3,000 mg/L in the cycle filtration experiment. In the second stage, further enhancement of water quality and organics retention were observed, as evidenced by the low effluent COD (<70 mg/L) and turbidity (5-20 NTU). Meanwhile, the effluent that was rich in nitrogen and phosphorus was suitable for agricultural irrigation or gardening. The results indicated that the developed two-stage PAC-DMF system could be a highly promising alternative to the conventional wastewater treatment process.

In this work, highly nanoporous cobalt and nitrogen codoped carbon polyhedra (C-Co-N) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOF) is synthesized and employed as tellurium host for Li-Te batteries. The Te@C-Co-N cathode with a high Te loading of 77.2 wt % exhibits record-breaking electrochemical performances including an ultrahigh initial capacity of 2615.2 mAh cm(-3) approaching the theoretical capacity of Te (2621 mAh cm(-3)), a superior cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 93.6%, a similar to 99% Columbic efficiency after 800 cycles as well as rate capacities of 2160, 1327.6, and 894.8 mAh cm(-3) at 4, 10, and 20 C, respectively. The redox chemistry of tellurium is revealed by in operando Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory simulations. The results illustrate that the performances are attributed to the highly conductive C-Co-N matrix with an advantageous structure of abundant micropores, which provides highly efficient channels for electron transfer and ionic diffusion as well as sufficient surface area to efficiently host tellurium while mitigating polytelluride dissolution and suppressing volume expansion.

The optimal conditions to prepare stable PDDA-SWCNTs aqueous dispersions were presented. Then, the positively charged PDDA-SWCNTs composite and negatively charged glucose oxidase (GOD) were employed to fabricate multilayer films on platinum (Pt) electrodes by layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. The consecutive growth of the multilayer films was confirmed by quartz crystal microbalance. Electrochemical measurements were used to study the properties of the proposed biosensor. Results demonstrated that SWCNTs were evenly dispersed within the PDDA films and efficiently improved the conductivity of the resulting films. Among the biosensors, the one based on seven layers of multilayer films got the best performance. It showed wide linear range of 0.05-12 mM, high sensitivity of 63.84 mu A/(mM cm(2)), low detection limit of about 4 mu M and small value of the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant, 8.46 mM. In addition, the biosensor also exhibited good suppression of interference and long-term operational stability. This protocol could be used to immobilize other enzymes to construct a range of biosensors. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we present the fabrication of nickel-cobalt sulfide (NiCo)(9)S-8 nanoparticles protected by NiCo-based oxyhydroxides coupled with nitrogen and sulfur codoped graphene substrates (N, S-doped G) via an ethylenediamine (EDA)-mediated assembly and electrochemical oxidation strategy, named O-(NiCo)(9)S-8/N, S-doped G. It was found that the (NiCo)(9)S-8 nanoparticles coated by the metal oxyhydroxide shell are tightly encapsulated into N, S-doped G frameworks, yielding a unique dual hybrid effect to achieve ample heterojunctions/interfaces and robust architecture, which is conducive to enhance electroactivity and cycling stability. As a proof-of-concept application, the as-fabricated O-(NiCo)(9)S-8/N, S-doped G as the electrode for the supercapacitor achieves a high specific capacity of 1247 F g(-1), that is, 166 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and a superior rate capability of 89% at 20 A g(-1). Further, the asymmetric supercapacitor made of the O-(NiCo)(9)S-8/N, S-doped G//activated carbon along with a high mass loading of about 6 mg cm(-2) exhibits an ultralong cycling stability of 70% after 20,000 cycles and a high charge storage capability of 50.8 W h kg(-1) at 400 W kg(-1), which is much better than those of the other comparative electrode materials.

Experimental results indicate that premixed PAC mitigated algal fouling, whereas pre-deposited PAC exhibited the opposite effect. The porous fouling layer in the pre-mixed case favored the retention of rejected EOM in the concentrated solution owing to a high backward migration rate. Conversely, the dense fouling layer in the pre-deposited case impeded the backward diffusion of EOM, which caused the majority of the rejected EOM to accumulate on the surface and at the bottom of the fouling layer. This difference in EOM distribution led to different cleaning efficiencies. Physical cleaning easily removed both algal cells and pre-mixed PAC from the membrane surfaces, whereas physical and chemical cleanings were both ineffective for pre-deposited PAC, owing to the stronger PAC-EOM attractive force and the NaClO-induced change in the chemical bonds of the PAC and even the membranes. Moreover, decreased algae growth rates were observed in the reactors with PAC as a result of changes in the illumination and the cake layer structure, which could further intensify the contrast between the effects of pre-deposited and pre-mixed PACs on fouling.

However, the realization of high-performance Mo2C catalysts is still limited because controlling their particle size and catalytic activity is challenging with current synthesis methods. Here, the synthesis of ultrafine beta-Mo2C nanoparticles with narrow size distribution (2.5 +/- 0.7 nm) and high mass loading (up to 27.5 wt%) on graphene substrate using a giant Mo-based polyoxomolybdate cluster, Mo-132((NH4)(42)[MO132O372(CH3COO)(30)(H2O)(72)]center dot 10CH(3)COONH(4)center dot 300 H2O) is demonstrated. Moreover, a nitrogen-containing polymeric binder (polyethyleneimine) is used to create Mo-N bonds between Mo2C nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped graphene layers, which significantly enhance the catalytic activity of Mo2C for the hydrogen evolution reaction, as is revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. The optimal Mo2C catalyst shows a large exchange current density of 1.19 mA cm(2), a high turnover frequency of 0.70 s(-1) as well as excellent durability. The demonstrated new strategy opens up the possibility of developing practical platinum substitutes based on Mo2C for various catalytic applications.

The Effect of a TiN Interlayer on the Tribological Properties of Diamond-like Carbon Films Deposited on 7A04 Aluminum Alloy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE			English	Article						Aluminum alloy; diamond-like carbon (DLC); TiN interlayer; wear resistance	ION-IMPLANTATION; DLC COATINGS; WEAR-RESISTANCE; TI6AL4V ALLOY; PLASMA; BEHAVIOR; ARC; RF; 2024-ALUMINUM-ALLOY	Aluminum-based alloys are known to be significant candidates in the automotive and aerospace industries. However, the relatively poor wear resistance of aluminum alloys restricts their further application. In this paper, diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are deposited on the 7A04 aluminum alloy to improve its wear resistance by electron cyclotron resonance plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Before the DLC film deposition, TiN films were first fabricated as interlayer between the 7A04 aluminum alloy and DLC films by unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The influence of the TiN buffer layer on the mechanical properties of the DLC film is studied. The results showed that the TiN interlayer could provide enough mechanical support for the DLC films by suppressing plastic deformation of the aluminum alloy and then could effectively improve wear resistance of DLC films on 7A04 aluminum alloy.

Active protection is a novel technique used to impede corrosion achieved by employing the CFRP wrap as the anode of the impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP). Passive protection denotes the anti-corrosion behaviour of the CFRP fabric. Nine reinforced concrete columns with different degrees of corrosion (theoretical mass losses of 1%, 3%, and 6%) were prepared and then treated with different protection methods (non-protection, passive protection, and active protection) by exposing them to wetedry cycles. By measuring the steel potential, linear polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of all investigated specimens, the efficiency of active protection was found to be closely related to the degree of the pre-corrosion of the protected specimens. Furthermore, the efficiency of active protection decreased with time, which may be attributed to the deterioration of the CFRP anode and CFRP/ concrete interface. Passive protection was proven to be effective in every case, however, it can only slow down the corrosion process but cannot stop the elicited corrosion response. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a new activated carbon (AC)-supported sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine (AC-CoPcS) catalyst was prepared through the chemical linkage of ethylenediamine between them. UV-VIS, FT-IR, BET, and XPS were used to characterize the structure of the new catalyst. Then AC-CoPcS was applied to catalyze sodium methylmercaptide (SMM) oxidation for the preparation of DMDS. The effect of process parameters, such as reaction time, catalyst dosage, reaction temperature, and oxygen pressure on SMM conversion per pass (CPPSMM), yield (Yield(DMDS)), and purity of the DMDS (Purity(DMDS)) product were investigated to evaluate the catalytic performance of AC-CoPcS. The new supported catalyst exhibits better catalytic performance than the commercial one and can be properly reused four times to obtain CPPSMM and Yield(DMDS) higher than 90% and 70%. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the CPPSMM and Yield(DMDS) could reach as high as 98.7% and 86.8%, respectively, and the purity of the DMDS product is as high as 99.8%. This new supported catalyst exhibits good industrial application prospects.

Nevertheless, their low energy density restricts their applications. Here, we synthesized phosphorus-doped bimetallic sulfides embedded in heteroatom-doped (N, S, and P) carbon shells (P-ZCS/HC) using a simple approach to create high-performance flexible electrodes. The three-dimensional architecture made by interlaced nanosheets was preserved, and raised nanoparticles appeared on the rough surface during the annealing operation, increasing the specific surface area and potential exposure to the electrolyte. It is noteworthy that the optimal P-ZCS/HC electrode possessed a remarkable capacity of 1080 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) along with superb cycling stability. These extraordinary properties were primarily caused by plentiful redox reactions, enhanced conductivity, and synergic effects of the P-doped metal sulfides and heteroatom-doped carbon shells. Density functional theory simulations confirmed the good function of the P-doped electrodes and their ability to boost conductivity, improve reactive dynamics, and promote OH- adsorption. Notably, the assembled all-solid-state hybrid SC exhibited a maximum energy density of 62.9 W h kg(-1) and a power density of 16 kW kg(-1), while being able to maintain 92.0% of its initial capacity after 10,000 cycles. This systematic report provides new insight into the design and synthesis of electrodes with complex components and outstanding structures for the flexible energy field.

Based on ultraviolet (UV) laser-induced modified photochemical reaction, we report an ingenious and green strategy to support highly dispersed Au NPs with controllable distribution on graphene oxide (GO). Without using any stabilizing agents or other complex chemical additives, the GO with abundant oxygen-containing functional groups can be effectively excited by 375 nm laser irradiation in HAuCl4 solution, resulting in controlled reduction of Au ions and then overgrowth of highly-purity Au NPs. Highly dense and monodisperse Au NPs with uniform diameter of similar to 20 nm formed on GO supports can be achieved by 30 min irradiation, which can offer maximized SEAS activity in comparison with GO/Au NPs obtained by other irradiation times. The optimized GO/Au NPs give rise to ultralow SERS analyses of (10(-14)M) methylene blue (MB), (10(-13) M) rho-damine 6G (R6G) and (10(-13) M) malachite green (MG), respectively. More importantly, it can also simultaneously analyze these three aromatic dyes in a mixture condition at detection limits as low as nano-mole level (10(-9) -10(-11) M), achieving the urgent requirement of mutually independent SERS trace detection. Therefore, the obtained GO/Au NPs with extremely high SERS activity and superior spectroscopic identification will be a prominent candidate for widespread SERS applications in real-word scenarios.

The study of intelligent measurement and monitoring of carbon emissions in smart logistics is of great value to reduce energy consumption, reduce carbon emissions in buildings, and improve the environment. In this paper, by comparing and analyzing the accounting standards of carbon emissions and their calculation methods, the carbon emission factor method is selected as the method to study the carbon emissions of the smart logistics process in this paper. The working principle of each key storage technology in the smart logistics process is analyzed to find out the equipment factors affecting the carbon emission of each storage technology in the smart logistics process, and the carbon emission calculation model of each key storage technology is established separately by using the carbon emission factor method. Meanwhile, according to the development history of energy consumption assessment, the assessment process of different stages from logistics storage energy consumption assessment to smart logistics energy consumption assessment is analyzed, and based on this, a carbon emission energy consumption assessment framework based on 5G shared smart logistics is constructed. This paper applies the supply chain idea to define the smart logistics supply chain, constructs a conceptual model of the smart logistics supply chain considering carbon emissions, and at the same time combines the characteristics of the smart logistics supply chain to analyze the correlation between the carbon emissions of the smart logistics supply chain and the related social, environmental, and economic systems.

The effects of properties of magnetite on activity of decomposition CO2 and mechanism of the reaction	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						decomposition of CO2; magnetite; performance of reduction; absorption properties; mechanism of reaction; quasi-catalytic reaction; deactivation; activation by reduction	TEMPERATURE PROGRAMMED DESORPTION; CATION-EXCESS MAGNETITE; METAL-OXIDE CATALYSTS; COMPLETE REDUCTION	The properties of reduction and adsorption of magnetite were investigated using temperature programming technique and thermogravimetrical (TG) analysis, and the properties of magnetite were correlated with the activity of decomposing COP into carbon. The smaller the particle size of magnetite, the larger the surface area; and the lower the activated temperature by H-2 reduction, and the faster the activated speed (the speed of lost oxygen), the greater the amount of adsorption of O-2 and CO2, i.e., the higher the activity of decomposing CO2 is. There was specific rapid adsorption of CO2 an Fe3O3-delta (delta > 0), with oxygen deficiency and this adsorption accompanied with decomposing CO2 into carbon. Fe3O4-delta transfers its electron to the carbon in CO2 therefore, CO2 decomposes into carbon. Simultaneously, Fe3O4-delta, captures the oxygen in CO2 and converts itself into stoichiometric Fe3O4; so, Fe3O4-delta is deactivated. But Fe3O4-delta could be regenerated by activating Fe3O4 by H-2 reduction. The reaction of decomposing CO2 into carbon with magnetite belongs to quasi-catalytic reactions, and is equal to one-side reaction of the reversible process of the water gas shift reaction (WGS). Decomposition of CO2 into carbon on oxygen-deficient magnetite undergoes via two steps: CO2 --> CO + O2- and CO --> C + O, the former step is the control step of the reaction speed, and the intermediate product of CO is rapidly converted further into carbon.

The barium stannate BaSnO3 (BSO) has exhibited great potential to be applied as PSCs' m-ETL. However, it lacks wide applications. Here, we report the synthesis of BSO nanoparticles with modulated crystallinity and oxygen vacancy distribution by controlling the heat treatment atmosphere during the synthesizing process via the co-precipitation method and demonstrate their applications as the m-ETL for printable hole-conductor-free carbon-based mesoscopic PSCs (p-MPSCs). We find that heat treatment under nitrogen greatly improves the crystallinity of BSO particles and brings oxygen vacancies, while annealing under oxygen leads to poor crystallinity but effectively eliminates the oxygen vacancies in BSO particles. The BSO particles are first heated in nitrogen to obtain better crystallization and dispersion and then cooled down in oxygen to reduce the surface defects. This heat treatment method could boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of p-MPSCs with the BSO m-ETL to 14.77%. However, the PCE values of devices based on BSO synthesized under nitrogen or oxygen alone are 11.94 and 6.86%, respectively.

Modal response and vibration attenuation performance of such structures were investigated experimentally and numerically. Furthermore, the free and forced vibration responses of simple laminated cylindrical panels (SLCPs), axial corrugated sandwich cylindrical panels (ACSCPs) and circular corrugated sandwich cylindrical panels (CCSCPs) with almost the same relative density were investigated and compared with that of BCSCPs. The results indicated that the numerical models were reasonable to estimate the vibration properties of BCSCPs, and the vibration attenuation performance can be improved by suitably increasing the thickness of face sheet and bi-direction corrugated core. Besides, it was revealed that the BCSCPs, ACSCPs and CCSCPs all had comparatively better vibration attenuation performance than that of the SLCPs, and the present BCSCPs generally had higher natural frequencies than those of the ACSCPs and CCSCPs with almost the same weight, which may provide some references for further engineering application of such kinds of composite sandwich structures.

The formation mechanism of the hollow structure, in which the Zn0.76Co0.24S nanoparticles were embedded in a nitrogen-doped carbon layer, was analyzed in this work. This electrode exhibits an excellent specific capacity of 937 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and a satisfying capacity retention rate of about 112% after 40000 cycles at a rate of 5 A g(-1). Such preeminent performance is realized via (1) the short electrolyte diffusion length caused by the hollow structure, (2) the high electrochemical activities provide by the bimetallic sulfide and heteroatom doping, (3) the efficient combination of faradaic and electrical double layer materials, and (4) the conductive network with multiple holes. The evaluation of electrochemical performance of the assembled HZCS@NC//RGO hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) was also done. Impressively, the HSC gives a satisfactory energy density of 55.47 W h kg(-1), a maximum power density of 16.55 kW kg(-1), and an ultra-long (100000) cycling life (108.9% retention of the initial capacity). This study presents a novel strategy for engineering stable poly-porous multicomponent hollow structures for the fabrication of prospective energy storage devices.

The conductive dense layer of the Fe3C/C membrane can replace the Al foil as a current collector and the finger-like macropores can host most of the sulfur active material (1.5-3.0 mg cm 2), thus buffering the volume expansion of the sulfur species and facilitating the ion/electrolyte transport for fast reaction kinetics; meanwhile, the sponge-like pores in the top layer of the composite membrane enable further S slurry loading. Density functional theory simulation (DFT) and Li2S6 adsorption measurements reveal that the doped Fe3C species in the composite membrane could effectively immobilize the S species and suppress the shuttle effect of the soluble polysulfides (LiPSs). The rationally designed Fe3C/C membrane cathodes could deliver a capacity of 601 mA h g 1 at 1C after 200 cycles even at a high sulfur loading of 3.4 mg cm 2, with a high areal capacity of 2.1 mA h cm 2. The cell with the sulfur loading of 3.4 mg cm 2 delivered a gravimetric energy density and volumetric energy density of 850 W h kg 1 and 1223 W h L 1, respectively. The selfsupporting membrane cathode with simultaneous commercial S filling and S/C slurry coating provides an alternative sulfur loading approach for battery assembly, thus presenting a useful strategy for practical applications in high energy-density and long cycling Li-S batteries.

Magnetization measurements performed on BSCCO samples with various CN doping levels do not indicate a change in the critical current density J(c) within experimental error. The embedding process did not have any detrimental effects on the superconducting critical temperature of any of the samples.

MWCNTs were solubilized in chitosan (Chit-MWCNTs) used to interact with GOD. Poly (allylamine) (PAA) and polyvinylsulfuric acid potassium salt (PVS) were alternately deposited on the cleaned Pt electrode surface ((PVS/PAA)(3)/Pt). The (PVS/PAA)(3)/Pt electrode was alternately immersed in Chit-MWCNTs and GOD to assemble different layers of multilayer films. PBS washing was applied at the end of each assembly deposition for dissociating the weak adsorption. Micrographs of MWCNTs were obtained by scanning electron microscope. and properties of the resulting biosensors were measured by electrochemical measurements. Among the resulting biosensors, the biosensor based on eight layers of multilayer films was best. The resulting biosensor was able to efficiently monitor glucose. with the response time within 8 s, a detection limit of 21 mu M estimated at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. a linear range of 1-10 mM, the sensitivity of 0.45 mu A/mM, and well stability. The study can provide a feasible simple approach on developing a new immobilization matrix for biosensors; and surface functionalization. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Controlled annealing can solve the problem of poor hydrophilicity of materials prepared by arc-discharged method, and what's more, a large number of Co/Co3O4 heterointerfaces can be constructed. Carbon-encapsulated Co/Co3O4 exhibited excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), even better than that of the reported precious metal catalysts in the literature. Excellent catalytic performance not only contributed to improved hydrophilicity, but also contributed to the synergistic effects of Co and Co3O4 on the catalytic 4-NP hydrogenation. The preparation process is appropriate for synthesizing various defective-rich metals or alloy@carbon electrocatalysts.

Because of the anthropogenic inputs, generally, the TDS values and major ionic compositions showed an increasing trend along the mainstream. The TDS values and most of the dissolved solutes compositions showed a dilution effect during storms, but the dilution effect did not strictly follow the theoretical dilution curve. Lighter delta C-13(DIC) values in the river after a rainstorm reflected the influx of rain water with biological CO2 during the rain event. Meanwhile, the negative relationship between delta C-13(DIC) values and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations in the mainstream at different sampling campaigns suggested significant degradation of organic matter in the riverine channels. The variabilities of DIC in an urban river were mainly impacted by biological activities and infiltration of soil carbon dioxide. This study demonstrated that hydrological events and anthropogenic inputs are the main controls on the variations of dissolved solutes compositions and the DIC dynamics for an urban river.

Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the CF content and mixing time had little influence on the crystallization and melting behavior of PLA. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the introduction of CFs tended to decrease the thermal stability of PLA/TPU/CF composites, and the increase of mixing time tended to increase the thermal stability of PLA/TPU/CF composites when the mixing time is <5 min. Rheological results showed that all the samples exhibited non-Newtonian and shear thinning characteristics. The storage modulus and complex viscosity both increased with the increase of the CF content. It also showed that the increase of mixing time tended to increase the storage modulus and complex viscosity of PLA/TPU/CF composites when the mixing time is <5 min. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the TPU/PLA blends contain a continuous PLA phase with evenly distributed TPU particles in the size range of 0.25-3 mu m, and the blends are immiscible at the micron scale. Mechanical properties showed that the addition of proper CF content could lead to an obvious increase (about 11.43%) in tensile strength.

Hydrolysis accompanied by the strong depolymerization and reorganization of the coal framework is beneficial to the removal of different kinds of oxygen-containing structures (including cross-linking bonds, functional groups, and heterocycles) from lignite; thus, the deoxidization effect of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) on hydrochar gradually strengthens with the increase in pretreatment temperature from 180 to 300 degrees C, resulting in the formation of a lot of disordered nanostructures and a smooth and compact surface. In the subsequent chemical activation stage, the microstructure of hydrochar is beneficial to the formation of a lot of graphene-like sheets and developed micropores even under a small amount of Na-based catalysts (20 wt %). The as-obtained C-HTC-300 with a highly ordered microstructure and a high specific surface area (S-BET) of 1945.33 m(2)/g has an excellent electrochemical performance. Compared with a large consumption of catalyst for synthesizing HPGAC in traditional chemical activation, the hydrothermal pretreatment-assisted method meets the environmental protection and low-cost preparation requirements.

A milestone has been recently achieved by demonstrating that single defect, a carbon atom substituting sulphur atom in single layer tungsten disulphide, can be engineered on demand at atomic size level precision, which holds a promise for a scalable and addressable unit. It is an immediate quest to reveal its potential as a qubit. To this end, we determine its electronic structure and optical properties from first principles. We identify the fingerprint of the neutral charge state of the defect in the scanning tunnelling spectrum. In the neutral defect, the giant spin-orbit coupling mixes the singlet and triplet excited states with resulting in phosphorescence at the telecom band that can be used to read out the spin state, and coherent driving with microwave excitation is also viable. Our results establish a scalable qubit in a two-dimensional material with spin-photon interface at the telecom wavelength region.

J	Liu, Y; Xia, XX; Tan, YY; Li, S				Liu, Yang; Xia, Xiaoxiao; Tan, Yuanyuan; Li, Song			O-2/N(2 )Separation Performance of MIL-101(Cr)/Graphene Oxide	ACTA CHIMICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						O-2/N-2 separation; metal-organic framework; MIL-101(Cr)/GO; recyclability	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; TEMPERATURE HYDROGEN STORAGE; ADSORPTION PERFORMANCE; CO2 UPTAKE; SEPARATION; CAPACITY; COMPOSITES; GAS; O-2; ISOTHERMS	The pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) technology is the promising approach for O-2/N-2 separation because of its low cost and facile manipulation, in which adsorbents dominate the separation performance. In recent years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recognized as the most potential adsorbents in gas adsorption and separation due to their ultrahigh surface area. In this work, MIL-101(Cr) with different weight percentages of graphene oxide (5%, 15% and 35%) was prepared by growing MIL-101(Cr) on pre-synthesized GO materials. The fmal product was activated under vacuum at 180 C for 12 h. Structure characterization of different MIL-101(Cr)/GO composites revealed that MIL-101(Cr)/GO-15 with 15% GO additive exhibited the highest specific surface area (3486 m (2).g(-1)) and pore volume (2.39 cm(3).g(-1)) compared with pristine MIL-101(Cr) and the composites with 5% and 35% GO additives. The high surface area and pore volume are beneficial for the O-2 uptake of MIL-101(CrYGO-15. Compared with the O-2 uptake of MIL-101(Cr)/GO-5 (0.35 mmol.g(-1)) and MIL-101(Cr)/GO-35 (0.31 mmol.g(-1)), MIL-101(Cr)/GO-15 exhibited the highest uptake of 0.54 mmol.g(-1). Further pore size distribution analysis demonstrated that the enhanced O-2 uptake of MIL-101(Cr)/GO-15 can be ascribed to its increased fraction of mesopores. On the other hand, O-2/N-2 selectivity of different MIL-101(Cr)/GO composites was also calculated according to ideal adsorbed solution theory (LAST), from which it was found that MIL-101(Cr)/GO-15 displayed the highest O-2/N-2 selectivity (1.2) in a binary gas mixture with the volume fraction of O-2/N-2 =1/4. Compared with pristine MIL-101, O-2/N-2 selectivity of MIL-101(Cr)/GO-15 was increased by 17.65%. Recyclability is one of the most important criteria to evaluate the gas adsorption performance of adsorbents. Therefore, the recyclability of MIL-101(Cr)/GO-15 was tested by measuring the O-2 adsorption and desorption isotherms for three cycles. It was revealed that 80% of O-2 uptake of MIL-101(Cr)/GO-15 was remained after three adsorption/desorption cycles, implicating the outstanding recyclability of MIL-101(Cr)/GO-15.

The immobilized Hb displays a couple of stable and well-defined redox peaks, whose formal potential (E-0) is -0.434 V (SCE) in a phosphate buffer solution of pH 7.0. The formal potential of the heme Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple shifts negatively linearly with increased pH with a slope of -42.3 mV/pH, denoting that one electron transfer accompanies single proton transportation. Both SWNTs and DHP can accelerate the electron transfer between Hb and the electrode. Using DHP/Hb/SWNTs-film-modified Au electrode, the interaction between Hb and taxol is investigated. The voltammetric response of Hb decreases with increasing concentration of taxol. The peak currents decreases proportionally to the taxol concentration at 1.4 x 10(-5) to 1.3 x 10(-4)M, the linear regression equation being Delta (A) = 2.9603 - 0.4225 c(taxol) (M), with a correlation coefficient (r) 0.9985, and the detection limit 6.95 x 10(-6)M (signal-to-noise ratio of three).

Functionalization of Carbon Microspheres Using 3-Methacryloxypropyl Trimethoxysilane and its Theoretical Elucidation	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Polymer; Simulation; Surface chemistry		Carbon microspheres were oxidized by a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids. Then oxidized carbon microspheres were modified by 3-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (KH-570) to prepare surface molecularly imprinted polymer for adsorbing dibenzothiophene. The effects of reaction time, KH-570 content and the ratio of ethanol to water on silanization were discussed. The morphologies and microstructures of all the samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetry. By virtue of the active sites on carbon microspheres, KH-570 with the double bonds was grafted onto the surface of carbon microspheres, with the optimum parameters: 0.3 g of oxidized carbon microspheres, 1.0 mL of KH-570, reaction for 2 h at 65 degrees C, pH similar to 5, 60 mL of ethanol + water (3:1, v/v). The dispersion of carbon microspheres in ethanol was also improved. The possible reaction mechanism was discussed on the basis of the density functional theory study. This lays an experimental and theoretical foundation for further application of functionalized carbon microspheres.	[Zhao, X. X.; Zhao, H. J.; Li, S.; Yang, Y. Z.; Yang, Z.; Liu, X.

Herein, we report ZnO/CoO mesoporous microspheres encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon shells (ZnO-CoO@NC) via self-templated solvothermal synthesis and subsequent in-situ pyrolysis of polypyrrole. The core of nanohybrid is derived from single-phase ZnCo2O4 microspheres and consists of uniform two-phase ZnO/CoO nanocrystals with interparticle mesopores. By virtue of the conductive layer of N-doped carbon and the interaction between mixed ZnO and CoO, the ZnO-CoO@NC mesoporous microspheres manifest the superior lithium storage properties as anode for LIBs, which exhibits the high Li+ storage capacity and the excellent cycling performance (1457 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) after 500 cycles), along with the competitive rate capability (381 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)).

In this study, we used an exponential decay function to estimate the vertical dynamics of SOC content and determined its influencing factors in a typical paddy soil area of the Chengdu Plain from the 1980s to the 2010s. Our results show an overall increase in SOC stocks at 0-100 cm from 11.8 Tg in the 1980s to 13.7 Tg in the 2010s. SOC content increased at depths of 0-40 cm and declined at depths of 40-100 cm over the past three decades. The exponential decay function parameters C-0 and k significantly increased by 31.4% and 18.2% respectively, which suggests the vertical pattern of SOC distribution changed. The increase in nugget effects of C-0 and k and the decrease in the relative contributions of the parent material, subgroup and distance-to-river indicate that extrinsic factors played increasing roles in the vertical variation of SOC content. Our study concludes that rice planting has led to vertical variations of SOC content and decreased the effects of intrinsic factors on the vertical variation of SOC content of Chengdu Plain paddy soils over the past three decades.

J	Innocent, C; Millot, R; Kloppmann, W				Innocent, Christophe; Millot, Romain; Kloppmann, Wolfram			A multi-isotope baseline (O, H, C, S, Sr, B, Li, U) to assess leakage processes in the deep aquifers of the Paris basin (France)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Paris basin; Albian aquifer; Dogger aquifer; NORMs; Leakage; Isotope hydrochemistry	HYDRAULIC FRACTURING FLUIDS; SHALE-GAS; OXYGEN ISOTOPES; GEOCHEMISTRY; GROUNDWATER; METHANE; WATER; LITHIUM; ORIGIN; EVOLUTION	Groundwaters from the deep Dogger and Albian aquifers from the Paris Basin in France have been analyzed for oxygen (H2O and SO4), hydrogen (H2O), carbon, boron, lithium, sulfur (SO4), strontium, and uranium isotopes. This study aims to establish a natural hydrogeochemical baseline against which any leak of saline fluids from deeper water masses could be evidenced in case of a hypothetic occurrence of non-conventional exploitation of the hydrocarbons that are present in the underlying Liassic shales. Waters from the Dogger and the Albian aquifers have respectively chloride-alkaline and calcium-bicarbonate geochemical facies, although some waters from the Albian aquifer tend to evolve towards the geochemical characteristics of the waters from the Dogger aquifer. Stable isotopes of the water molecule indicate that waters from the Albian aquifer have a meteoritic origin, whereas saline waters of the Dogger aquifer are mainly influenced by primary and secondary brine inflow from the Triassic evaporitic deposits, and also by diffusive exchanges with the porewaters of the Liassic shales (Bensenouci et al., 2010). Carbon isotopes display delta 13C values that are much higher (>0%o) in waters from the Dogger aquifer waters than those from the Albian (<=- 9%o). Oxygen and sulfur isotopes of dissolved sulfates measured in the waters from the Dogger indicate that sulfur comes probably from the Triassic evaporites, whose signatures are overprinted by bacterial sulfate reduction. The water from the Pantin well near Paris displays isotopic characteristics that are comparable to the saline waters from the Dogger. On the other hand, dissolved sulfates of the other waters from the Albian indicate two different sources: sulfates derived from sulfides that have undergone abiotic oxidation processes, and atmospheric and/or crustal sources. Uranium activity ratios are very high in most groundwaters from the Albian, especially northwest of the Paris region where ratios as high as 20 have been measured. These activity ratios are in most cases higher than those of the saline waters from the Dogger, and suggest important water/rock interaction processes within the Albian aquifer in agreement with Li isotopes data. Boron and strontium isotopic data suggest that some waters from the Albian record the geochemical influence of saline waters comparable to those of underlying aquifers of the Paris Basin, especially Northeast of Paris, in agreement with recent geophysical studies. In the present work, we critically evaluate the information that can be derived from each of the tested isotope systematics in terms of leakage and mixing processes as might occur as the result of man-induced hydraulic shortcuts or changes in the pressure gradients between deep groundwater levels. Sulfur, oxygen, strontium and boron reveal the most sensitive indicators of mixing processes, whereas lithium and, in particular, uranium isotope ratios are strongly overprinted by water-rock interaction and redox processes.

VGCNFs were first dispersed in water-borne epoxy resin by intensive stirring and then mixed with curing agent and blowing agent at room temperature. VGCNF/epoxy foams were obtained from these mixtures via freeze-drying and foaming under a vacuum at 100 degrees C. The shape memory properties of the epoxy foams were evaluated together with other physical properties. Compression and thermo-mechanical cycle tests were performed to measure the effects of the VGCNFs on the mechanical performance of the foams. Electrical conductivity was measured using a standard four-point method. The experimental results indicated that the VGCNF/epoxy foams had a low glass transition temperature of 48 degrees C, resulting in a fast recovery rate at 65 degrees C in 10 s. The epoxy foam had a high shape recovery and fixity ratio of more than 90% after several thermo-mechanical cycles with the addition of 1.0 wt% VGCNFs. The VGCNFs enhanced the strength and electrical conductivity of the epoxy foams. The percolation threshold for conduction was approximately 0.6 wt% of VGCNFs in the composites.

Hollow carbon spheres in microwaves: Bio inspired absorbing coating	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article								The electromagnetic response of a heterostructure based on a monolayer of hollow glassy carbon spheres packed in 2D was experimentally surveyed with respect to its response to microwaves, namely, the Ka-band (26-37GHz) frequency range. Such an ordered monolayer of spheres mimics the well-known "moth-eye"-like coating structures, which are widely used for designing anti-reflective surfaces, and was modelled with the long-wave approximation. Based on the experimental and modelling results, we demonstrate that carbon hollow spheres may be used for building an extremely lightweight, almost perfectly absorbing, coating for Ka-band applications.

The Ag-ATG composites possess novel microstructure, in which TiO2 mesoporous spheres of hundreds of nanometers in size are decorated with dense nano-sized Ag3PO4 to form pinecone-liked Ag3PO4/TiO2 particles, which were further wrapped by rGO sheets that are selectively decorated with Ag NPs. The Ag-ATG composites exhibit improved photocatalytic performance toward degradation of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) under visible light compared to bare Ag3PO4 and Ag3PO4/TiO2/rGO (ATG). The underlying mechanism has been studied based on the results of reactive oxygen species capture experiment, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and photocurrent measurements under visible light and monochromatic lights. The improved photocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to the efficient spatial separation of photo-induced electrons and holes in Ag-ATG, i.e., the electrons in Ag3PO4 transfer to Ag-rGO, meanwhile the holes in Ag3PO4 transfer to TiO2. Ag NPs play an important role in the hybrid structure owing to the synergistic effect of Ag NPs and rGO, which not only enhance the light harvest but also increase the capacity of electron accepting from Ag3PO4. Meanwhile, active photo-induced electrons at the plasmonic Ag NPs can facilitate the formation of O-2(center dot-) radicals for photocatalysis. As a result, both the stability and photocatalytic active of Ag-ATG are significantly improved.

The electrochemical methods, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were used to evaluate the electrochemical performances toward AA, UA, DA and rutin on the PdAu/RGO/GCE. Good linearships were observed for all the four molecules in the ranges of 12.5-700 mu M, 1.25-73.75 mu M, 2.5-66.25 mu M and 0.025-5.625 mu M, with the detection limits of 12.5 mu M, 0.75 mu M, 2.5 mu M and 0.025 mu M, respectively. Finally, the modified electrode has fairly good performance during the employment of real sample analysis to determine the content of AA, DA, UA and rutin. These results all indicate that the RGO modified bimetallic nanomaterials are supposed to be a promising material in the electrochemical determination of small biological molecules.

Three grating spectrometers are equipped on TanSat to measure the reflected sunlight in the 0.76 mu m O2A-band, 1.61 mu m weak CO2 band and 2.06 mu m strong CO2 band respectively. Three bands have high spectral resolution and signal to noise ratio (SNR), while their spectral and radiometric calibration have been reported in many articles. This paper describes the geometric calibration of the essential payload (ACGS) on the TanSat. In the assembly process, the flatness only in the spatial dimension is strictly controlled owing to the physical obstruction. The geometric deflection error in one band should be tested and corrected by adjusting the starting rows of different spectral samplings. Meanwhile, the alignment error among the three bands also need processing in the same way to ensure that the slits of the three bands were matched the corresponding geographic target. Finally, the geometric correction results of the thermal-vacuum testing suggested that the alignment accuracy is well enough to match the requirements. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Novel Hybrid Carbon Price Forecasting Model Based on Radial Basis Function Neural Network	ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHMS	In the wake of the stronger and stronger development of carbon market, the carbon price fluctuation has drawn the attention of researchers, encouraging numerous researchers involved in the carbon price study. Owing to the strongly nonstationary and nonlinear characteristics of carbon price, most of existing approaches failed to forecast the carbon price perfectly. In our study, a novel hybrid forecasting model is presented to forecast the carbon price. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) and independent component analysis (ICA) are utilized to preprocess the chosen data for getting the independent components. Then the independent components are trained by radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to predict them respectively. Finally, the forecasting result is obtained by linear combination. In addition, the numerical results show that the VMD-ICA-RBFNN model outperforms wavelet-based NN, VMD-RBFNN, EMD-ICA-RBFNN, RBFNN, ARIMA-GARCH and ARIMA models.	[Wang, S.; E, J. W.; Li, S.

PPCPE was fabricated by mixing polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres as the template, graphite powders as the filler, pyrrole as the precursor of polymer which actually acted as the paste. After the polymerization of pyrrole catalyzed by Fe3+, the template PMMA microspheres were removed to form PPCPE. The pore size were determined by SEM observations, their diameters were in the range from 2 to 5 Am, and the specific surface area of PPCPE was 42.76 m(2)/g by N-2 adsorption at 77 K using the Brunauer Emmet Teller (BET) method. The hybridization reaction on the electrode was monitored by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) analysis using the method of gold nanoparticle-catalyzed silver enhancement. Compared with previous DNA sensors the attached DNA and complementary DNA detection sensitivity were dramatically increased. The experiments of ASV showed that the peak current of Ag at PPCPE were linear with the amount of complementary oligonucleotide ranging from 1 to 80 nM and 0.08 to 1 nM, the detection limit was as low as 0.05 nM.

Continuous measurement of black carbon aerosol in urban Nanjing of Yangtze River Delta, China	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Black carbon aerosol; Concentration; Temporal variations; Pollution episode; Yangtze River Delta	OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; LIGHT-ABSORPTION; EMISSIONS; MONOXIDE; AETHALOMETER	As a short-lived climate forcing agent, black carbon (BC) aerosol plays an important role in climate change, atmospheric environment, and human health. In this study, continuous measurements of BC and trace gases were made at an urban site in Nanjing, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) of China in 2012. The annual mean BC concentration in Nanjing was found to be 4157 +/- 2626 ng/m(3), with a range of 221-24,686 ng/m(3). The value was much lower than that in most megacities of China and also lower than that in LinAn, a rural site in YRD. BC concentrations in Nanjing showed strong seasonality, high in spring and autumn and low in summer. The concentrations also varied diurnally, high at rush hours and low in the afternoon. The diurnal cycles of BC loadings in winter to spring 2012 were similar to those in 2011 in magnitude and shape. BC concentrations followed a typical lognormal pattern, with over 75% of data samples between 1000 and 6000 ng/m(3). The maximum frequency occurred in low BC concentrations in summer and high BC concentrations in other seasons. In Nanjing, high levels of BC were mainly caused by local and regional emissions. Low levels of BC were mostly associated with winds from northern and eastern directions of Nanjing. BC and CO varied similarly with season, having a correlation coefficient over 0.7 in most seasons. Annual mean Delta BC/Delta CO was about 7 ng/m(3)/ppb, implying that the sources of the BC likely came from combustions of bio-fuel, industry-coal, and vehicle-gasoline. Serious pollution episodes with high levels of BC were detected in early June at the site. Analysis suggested that the episodes were due to biomass burning in northwestern region of Nanjing. During this period, Delta BC/Delta CO reached about 9.7 ng/m(3)/ppb and much higher BC levels were found at mid-night. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhuang, B. L.; Wang, T.

QUANTUM DOTS; SILICA NANOPARTICLES; SENSITIVE DETECTION; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; FACILE SYNTHESIS; FAST-RESPONSE; PROBE; BIOSENSOR; IONS; GENERATION	Detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) is critical for understanding the mechanisms of diseases. In this work, a convenient ratiometric fluorescent method for determination of ROS was developed basing on a nontoxic nanohybrid system which was constructed by carbon dots (CDs) and gold nanoclusters (Au NCs). The combination was prepared easily basing on self- assembly without any complex process, achieving maximum reservation of the two fluorescent properties. Thus the limit of detection (LOD) for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hypochlorite (ClO-) was lower down to 0.1 mu M after the experimental conditions were optimized. Being built to reflect H2O2, the test paper provided a method of convenient visual detection with double fluorescence of CDs/Au NCs. Furthermore, the biosensor was proven to be suitable for the detection of H2O2 and glucose (Glu) in human serum examples. The proportion of CDs and Au NCs was adjusted optionally to different color, while keeping the nanohybrid in high physiological stability and excellent biocompatibility. The excellent performance of this ratiometric biosensor is expected to facilitate further development of rapid and high-throughput detection of ROS.

A UASB bioreactor using silage as a carbon source to reduce sulfate	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY			English	Article						cattle drinking water; silage; sulfate-reduction; UASB; water treatment	CATTLE; TOXICITY; WATER	Low cost-treatment for sulfate removal is required in many areas where potable water is scarce. The biggest challenge in biological treatment is finding an abundant low or no-cost carbon source. This work demonstrated for the first time that leachate from the agricultural byproduct silage can be used in an upflow anaerobic sludge-bed bioreactor to reduce sulfate for on-farm water treatment. The reactor ran continuously for approximately one year with an average silage leachate feed COD concentration of 4,471 +/- 857 mg L-1, and sulfate feed concentrations varying from 1,253 to 2,081 mg L-1. The maximum sulfate reduction rate (SRR) of 9.75 +/- 0.23 mmol (L day) (-1) was achieved at the high sulfate influent concentration and the amount of organics consumed was between 80-90%. Sulfide levels in the UASB bioreactor were consistently high for most of the experiment, averaging 516.6 +/- 188.5 mg L-1. Interestingly, during the last month of operation when sulfide concentrations were highest the SRR continued to increase. It was estimated that 36% of the silage leachate carbon was used directly for sulfate reduction.

The nanocomposite cathode material is synthesized by chemical precipitation of sulphur onto functionalized MWCNTs followed by in situ polymerization of indole. The MWCNT/S/PIN nanocomposite exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1490 mA h g(-1) and enhanced cycling stability compared to the binary nanocomposite (MWCNT/S). The MWCNT/S/PIN composite cathode displays a specific capacity of 1043 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C rate with 70% capacity retention. The better electrochemical performance of the ternary nanocomposite cathode material is attributed to the synergistic effect of the functionalized MWCNTs and polyindole which provides an improved conductivity and effective fencing of intermediate polysulphides.

The SEM images of the S-EG materials indicate the nanocomposites consist of nanosheets with a layer-by-layer structure. Electrochemical tests reveal that the nanocomposite with a sulphur content of 60% (0.6S-EG) can deliver the highest discharge capacity of 1210.4 mAh g(-1) at a charge-discharge rate of 280 mA g(-1) in the first cycle, the discharge capacity of the 0.6S-EG remains as high as 957.9 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles of charge-discharge. Furthermore, at a much higher charge-discharge rate of 28 A g(-1), the 0.6S-EG cathode can still deliver a high reversible capacity of 337.5 mAh g(-1). The high sulphur utilization, excellent rate capability and reduced over-discharge phenomenon of the 0.6S-EG material are exclusively attributed to the particular microstructure and composition of the cathode.

The Se-NCHPC composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. It is found that the elemental selenium was dispersed inside the hierarchical pores of NCHPC. It is demonstrated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic discharge-charge processes that the Se-NCHPC composite has a large reversible capacity and high rate performance as cathode materials. The Se-NCHPC composite with a selenium content of 56.2 wt% displays an initial discharge capacity of 435 mA h g(-1) and a reversible discharge capacity of 305 mA h g(-1) after 60 cycles at a 2 C charge-discharge rate. In particular, the Se-NCHPC composite presents a long electrochemical stability at a high rate of 5 C. The results reveal that the electrochemical reaction constrained inside the interconnected macro/meso/micropores of NCHPC would be the dominant factor for the enhancement of the high rate performance of the selenium cathode, and the nitrogen-containing hierarchical porous carbon network would be a promising carbon matrix structure for lithium-selenium batteries.

However, related studies on the different types of reservoirs are still inadequate. Therefore, we sampled the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), a typical river-type reservoir having both river and lake characteristics, using an online system (HydroCTM/CO2) and YSI-6600v2 meter to determine the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and physical chemical parameters in 2013. The results showed that the CO2 flux from the mainstream ranged from 26.1 to 92.2 mg CO2/m(2) h with average CO2 fluxes of 50.0 mg/m(2) h. The CO2 fluxes from the tributary ranged from -10.91 to 53.95 mg CO2/m(2) h with area-weighted average CO2 fluxes of 11.4 mg/m(2) h. The main stream emits CO2 to the atmosphere the whole year; however, the surface water of the tributary can sometimes act as a sink of CO2 for the atmosphere. As the operation of the TGR, the tributary became more favorable to photosynthetic uptake of CO2 especially in summer. The total CO2 flux was estimated to be 0.34 and 0.03 Tg CO2/year from the mainstream and the tributaries, respectively. Our emission rates are lower than previous estimates, but they are in agreement with the average CO2 flux from temperate reservoirs estimated by Barros et al. (Nat Geosci 4(9):593-596, 2011).

Here we upscaled site-level NEE from 44 grassland flux towers (1,457 site-months) to the global scale by using a model tree ensemble approach that considers the management activities (grazing and cutting) (MTE-GM). Cross-validation showed that MTE-GM performs reasonably well in terms of among-site variability and seasonal variation, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.90 and 0.86 and an R-2 of 0.91 and 0.86, respectively. Radiation (shortwave and longwave), temperature, leaf area index, and fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation had the highest relative explanatory power in predicting NEE. Based on MTE-GM, mean annual NEE of global grassland was 72 +/- 4 g C m(-2) year(-1) (1.9 +/- 0.11 Pg C year(-1)) during 1982-2011, suggesting that the grassland ecosystems have been acting as a small carbon source during the past three decades. However, grasslands in temperate and continental regions had the largest carbon sink of -61.9 +/- 5.7 and -51.8 +/- 7.9 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Moreover, we found that elimination of grassland management effect resulted in an extra emission of 1.7% CO2 to the atmosphere (CO2 sink from the management is 0.03 Pg C year(-1)). From the 1980s to the 2000s, 38% (22%) and 17% (18%) of pixels showed an increased (decreased) carbon uptake and decreased (increased) carbon release, respectively. Uncertainty assessment suggested that there would be higher confidence in NEE estimates in most parts of middle-to high-latitude regions in the Northern Hemisphere.

By skillfully designing, hierarchical brain coral-like WS2 nanosheets are synthesized. The novel structure is consisted of WS2 nanosheets arrayed along the same crystal plane, which expose a large number of adsorption active sites and enhance the adsorption of polysulfides. At the same time, the multilayer sheet structure has a large specific surface area and increases the sulfur loading. The brain coral-like WS2/S cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, which delivers an initial discharge specific capacity of 1308 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. And when cycles at 2 C, the discharge specific capacity is maintained at 721 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles, together with a low decay of 0.06% per cycle.

This study was designed to investigate whether carbon monoxide-saturated polymerized human placenta hemoglobin (CO-PolyPHb) attenuates cardiac I-R injury and to elucidate the underlying mechanism(s). Sixty male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: saline + sham group, PolyPHb + sham group, CO-PolyPHb + sham group, saline + I-R group, PolyPHb + I-R group, and CO-PolyPHb + I-R group. Rats were pretreated with injection of PolyPHb, CO-PolyPHb (0.5 g Hb/kg/d), or an equivalent volume of saline via caudal vein for 3 days. After pretreatment, hearts were isolated Langendorff perfused and subjected to 30-minute no-flow ischemia and 120-minute reperfusion. As compared with the saline + I-R group, pretreatment with CO-PolyPHb greatly improved the recovery of cardiac function, reduced infarct size, and suppressed the release of cardiac enzyme. Importantly, CO-PolyPHb showed more prominent cardioprotective effect than PolyPHb, exhibiting a promising therapeutic potential in cardiac I-R injury. Further study demonstrated that CO-PolyPHb activated molecular signaling toward mitophagy and significantly elevated the mitochondrial respiratory function in the heart. In addition, CO-PolyPHb upregulated the phosphorylation of the proteins in insulin signaling pathway and increased the glucose uptake rate in cardiomyocytes. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway by wortmannin abrogated the anti-I-R effect of CO-PolyPHb. In conclusion, using an isolated rat heart model, we have demonstrated that pretreatment with CO-PolyPHb provided protective effect against cardiac I-R injury, and this protection was mediated by the improvement of mitochondrial function and activation of insulin signaling pathway in the heart.

However, the impact of the environment on the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks consecutive to orchard grass coverage remain poorly quantified at a large scale. The present study aimed to examine the responses of SOC stocks to grass coverage at a soil depth of 0-30 cm in orchards compared to clean tillage. A total of 342 observations across China from 139 peer-reviewed publications were subjected to meta-analysis. Aggregated boosted tree analysis was performed, evaluating the determinants of SOC stocks, such as plant traits (e.g., fruit tree type, grass type, orchard age, and grass age), edaphic variables (e.g., initial SOC and nitrogen concentration, soil pH, and soil clay content), climatic factors (e.g., mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT)), and management practices (e.g., grass source, grass growing mode, fertilization, grass mowing, placement of mowed residues, and irrigation). On average, orchard grass coverage significantly enhanced SOC stocks by 21.47% (percentage change) compared to clean tillage. Biotic and abiotic factors influenced this increase in SOC stocks following grass coverage in orchards to different extents. Grass age and soil clay content were the main determinants driving the variation in the SOC stocks following grass coverage in orchards. Thus, we propose an efficient way to optimize C sequestration in grass covered orchards, regarding plant traits, climatic factors, edaphic variables, and management practices. Longer than 12 months of surface grass coverage with cultivated grass species in mature deciduous fruit orchards (>= 5 years) efficiently increased SOC stocks. This is particularly the case for acidic (pH < 6.5) soils with low C content (SOM < 15 g kg(-1)) in areas with suitable rainfall and temperature conditions (MAP >= 400 mm, MAT >= 10 degrees C). Collectively, this meta-analysis identified orchard grass coverage as a promising practice for significantly increasing SOC stocks at 0-30 cm across large geospatial locations in China.

PAC dosing strategies play dominant roles on the fouling of microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes under constant flux mode, owing to the alteration of PAC-membrane interactions. Hence, how to further increase the membrane flux in the PAC-GDM system needs more investigation. In this study, the effects of PACs on the fouling by treated domestic wastewater were evaluated during GDM filtration using three different PAC dosing strategies: pre-depositing PACs onto membrane surfaces, and mixing PACs with bulk feeds in reactors totally before filtration and mixing PACs with bulk feeds in reactors periodically during filtration. PACs in three dosing modes all improved the removal of organics, but showed conflict effects on the fouling. Unlike mixed PACs increasing the final flux by more than two times than that obtained in the control system, pre-deposited PACs showed a dramatically negative effect on the flux development with a final value decreased by 75.0%. As demonstrated by the scanning electron microscopy images of biofilm structures and the contents of dissolved organic carbon and adenosine triphosphate in reactors, pre-deposited PAC layer aggravated the accumulation of organics and microorganisms with the formation of a stratified and compact structure, which hindered their back-transport to the bulk water. However, mixed PACs induced the formation of a uniform and porous biofilm, which favored the retained organics and microorganisms migrating back into concentrated waters, especially for pre-mixed PACs. This study links PAC dosing strategies, physical structures of biofilms and spatial distributions of organics and microorganisms, with practical relevance for the hydraulic performance of GDM systems, hopefully leading to a wider application of PAC-GDM systems in wastewater treatment.

In this work, we propose a synergistic strategy by taking advantages of polyetherimide (PEI) and ZIF-67 to enhance the interfacial strength of carbon fiber (CF) reinforced polyetheretherketone (PEEK) composites via a facile route. The bare CF is simply immersed into PEI solution and the aqueous solution of ZIF-67 precursors stepwise at room temperature to wrap PEI intermediate sizing layer and in situ grow ZIF-67 crystals. The surface morphology of CF indicates that regulating the concentration of PEI sizing agents can control the relative amount of ZIF-67 adhered onto CF surface. After modification, the tensile strength of single CF shows no deterioration and the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of as-prepared modified CF/PEEK reveals an increase of 40.5%. Besides, the enhanced interfacial interaction mechanism might be ascribed to miscible feature of PEI with PEEK and rough structure from ZIF-67. This work may shed some light on establishing a facile and effective synthetic approach to modify CF and improve the performance of composites without degrading the mechanical property of pristine CF.

However, the road towards such composite structure is severely hindered due to the easy aggregation of these nanometer-sized components. Here we demonstrate a big step to approach the ideal composite structure for carbon nanotube (CNT) where all the CNTs were highly packed, aligned, and unaggregated, with the impregnated polymers acting as interfacial adhesions and mortars to build up the composite structure. The strategy was based on a bio-inspired aggregation control to limit the CNT aggregation to be sub 20-50 nm, a dimension determined by the CNT growth. After being stretched with full structural relaxation in a multi-step way, the CNT/polymer (bismaleimide) composite yielded super-high tensile strengths up to 6.27-6.94 GPa, more than 100% higher than those of carbon fiber/epoxy composites, and toughnesses up to 117-192 MPa. We anticipate that the present study can be generalized for developing multifunctional and smart nanocomposites where all the surfaces of nanometer-sized components can take part in shear transfer of mechanical, thermal, and electrical signals.

It was confirmed by scanning electron microscope images that the MgNi alloy surface was modified by shorter and broken CNTs. The MgNi-CNT composites prepared by ballmilling after 60 min were found to show improved electrochemical properties with respect to the original MgNi alloy. In particular, the discharge capacity of the composite electrode increased from 400 to 480 mAh/g by surface modification with CNTs. The electrochemical reaction activity of the composite electrode was improved as confirmed by cyclic voltammogram. The analysis of the electrochemical impedance spectra showed that the double layer capacitance of the composite electrode increased under steady-state condition, which related to surface area of the particles. On the contrary, however, the improvement of the electrode cycle life was unsatisfactory, which probably attributed to the further generation of a new MgNi-CNT interface.

In this work, we report a polymer-free transfer method of GNWs grown on the copper foil for the fabrication of GNWs/Si solar cells. This allows us to further improve the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells by means of interface engineering. An optimized photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of the as-fabricated GNWs/Si solar cell can reach up to 4.99%. Furthermore, the PCE of the device is further improved by introducing the spiro-OMeTAD thin film as an interface layer, which serves as an electron-blocking and hole-transporting layer through tuning the band structure of the solar cells. Without any chemical doping and anti-reflecting coating, the maximum PCE of 8.27% has been achieved for the GNWs/spiro-OMeTAD/Si solar cell through optimizing the dopant content and the thickness of the spiro-OMeTAD thin film. We believe that our study indicates a new route for the fabrication of high-efficiency, low-cost GNWs/Si Schottky heterojunction solar cells without the need for chemical doping of the GNWs.

The as-prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nitrogen adsorption techniques. Their capacitance performances were evaluated using both cycle voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods. It was found that the specific capacitance of the composites firstly increased with the reaction time, and then it slightly decline and leveled off finally. The highest specific capacitance (170 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g) is obtained when the reaction time is 6 h. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

Dynamical behavior of the kink motion in carbon nanotubes	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							INTRAMOLECULAR JUNCTIONS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; ELECTRON; DEFECTS	By performing molecular dynamics calculations, we studied the motion of the kink between two carbon nanotubes. Based on the sequential evaporation of the most energetic carbon atom, our calculations show that the kink has complex longitudinal and spiral motions, in good agreement with the experiments. The kink moves towards the nanotube of larger diameter, resulting in an overall diameter shrinking of the nanotubes without inducing any disorder or damage. The kink motions are found to be dependent on the chirality of the nanotubes. The kink connecting two zigzag nanotubes can have either a pseudoclimb or a spiral motion, while the kink between the armchair nanotubes has an interesting spiral motion with periodic split and recombination of the topological defects.

We find that the n-benzo-CMP and BN-n-benzo-CMP (n = 3, 4, 5) sheets are all semiconductors with direct band gaps (0.57-1.75 eV). Their band gap decreases with increasing pore size n. In addition, the 1D armchair and zigzag p-GNRs tailored from 2D n-benzo-CMP and BN-n-benzo-CMP (n = 3, 4, 5) sheets are all semiconductors with their band gaps ranging from 0.19 to 2.0 eV. BN codoping, pore size (n), and the width of nanoribbons (w) can all be used to tune the band gap of either 2D porous graphenes or their corresponding 1D p-GNRs. Computed current-voltage (I-V-b) curves are consistent with the semiconducting properties and suggest that both BN-3-benzo-CMPs and BN-p-3ZGNRs (w = 4) can be exploited for applications in low-dimensional electronics.

Results showed that a layer of continuous Ni membrane was coated on the surface of CF. Ni-CF/polyether ether ketone (PEEK) composites were prepared by melt-mixing. The thermal conductivity of the Ni-CF/PEEK composite reached 0.59W/(mK), which is 2.54 times higher than that of pure PEEK. When the Ni-CF content was 40wt%, the electrical conductivity of the composites reached to the value of 1.9x10(4)S/m.

In this work, a facile wet-chemical method is reported to synthesize ultrafine IrxNiy alloy encapsulated in porous N-doped carbon (BMNC) derived from bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Benefiting from the advantages of alloy effect between Ir and Ni, high surface area and more active site exposing, the optimal sample Ir3Ni2/BMNC with only 7.7 wt% Ir content reveals outstanding OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline and acidic electrolyte. When evaluated in 1 m KOH, Ir3Ni2/BMNC exhibits low overpotential of 279 mV to drive current density of 10 mA cm(-2) compared with IrO2 (322 mV), 59.4 times Ir mass activity of 303 A g(Ir)(-1) higher than IrO2 (5.1 Ag-Ir(-1)) and prominent durability of 40 000 s for chronopotentiometry test. Assessed in 0.1 m HClO4, Ir3Ni2/BMNC also possesses long stability of 40 000 s for chronopotentiometry, high current density (eta(10) = 321 mV) and 19.9 times Ir mass activity (303 A g(Ir)(-1)) superior to IrO2 of eta(10) = 350 mV and 15.2 A g(Ir)(-1), respectively. The brilliant durability attributes to the structure of alloy nanoparticles anchored in porous N-doped carbon.

The scavenger experiments demonstrated that center dot O-2(-), h(+) were main active species under visible irradiation. Furthermore, the photodegradation pathways of DCF and CBZ were detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instruments and three, dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectra (3D EEMs). Eventually, the possible photocatalytic mechanisms of BCCNT were proposed.

A fully packaged self-powered sensor based on near-field electrospun arrays of poly(vinylidene fluoride) nano/micro fibers	EXPRESS POLYMER LETTERS			English	Article						smart polymers; electrical properties; poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF); near-field electrospinning (NFES); graphene-based piezoelectric generator (GBPG)	ENERGY HARVESTING PERFORMANCE; DIRECT-WRITE; HYBRID CELL; GRAPHENE; TRANSPARENT; NANOGENERATOR; NANOWIRE; OXIDE; MOTION; FILMS	Energy harvesting devices based on the triboelectric and piezoelectric principles have been widely developed to scavenge wasteful and tiny mechanical energy into usable electrical energy. In particular, triboelectric energy harvesting generators with relatively simpler structure and piezoelectric fiber-based counterpart with extremely light weight compositions showed a very promising application in the self-powered sensors. In this paper, a novel hybridization of graphene-based piezoelectric generator (GBPG) and graphene-PET triboelectric generator (GPTG) were simultaneously packaged. The integrated structure, graphene-based hybridized self-powered sensor (GHSPS), was demonstrated to be optically transparent and mechanically robust. For the piezoelectrically harvesting device, an in-situ poling and direct-write near-field electrospinning (NFES) Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) piezoelectric fibers were fabricated and integrated with a single layer chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene. On the other hand for GPTG counterpart, two composite layers of a single layer graphene/PET simultaneously served as triboelectrically rubbing layers as well as bottom/top electrode. This GHSPS successfully superimposed both piezoelectric and triboelectric electricity and the synergistically higher output voltage/current/power were measured as similar to 6 V/280 nA/172 nW in one press-and-release cycle of finger induced motion. The proposed GHSPS showed a promising application in the field of self-powered sensors to be ubiquitously implemented in the future Industry 4.0 scenarios.

Then, the molecularly imprinting polymerization was carried out towards the macromolecule PAMPS grafted on the surface of CMSs using dibenzothiophene (DBT) as template, ethylene dimethacrylate as cross-linking agent and (NH4)(2)S2O8 (APS) as initiator to prepare surface molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP-PAMPS/CMSs) for adsorbing DBT. The optimized conditions of grafting PAMPS, including AMPS dosage, APS content, reaction temperature and reaction time, were emphasized in this paper. The morphology of the samples was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The functional groups were analyzed qualitatively by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The grafting degree of PAMPS was investigated by thermogravimetry. The results show that the preferable AMPS dosage, APS content, reaction temperature and time were 5 g, 0.15 g, 70 degrees C and 12 h, respectively, for preparing PAMPS/CMSs composite on the basis of 1.0 g of silanized-CMSs. The absorbing characteristic of MIP-PAMPS/CMSs toward DBT was studied preliminarily with dynamic adsorption. In the experiment of dynamic adsorption, MIP-PAMPS/CMSs and non-imprinted polymer (NIP-PAMPS/CMSs) were compared with respect to their rapid adsorption in 1 mmol/L of DBT solution in n-hexane. When the first 1 mL of 1 mmol/L DBT solution was injected and flowed through a column packed with 0.1 g of MIP-PAMPS/CMSs, the content of DBT reduced to 0.265 mmol/L, that is, decreased significantly from 279 to 74 ppm. When 3 mL of DBT solution was flowed through the packed column, the adsorption of MIP-PAMPS/CMSs toward DBT reached saturation with the maximum adsorption amount of 1.38 x 10(-2) mmol/g and the overall adsorption efficiency of 46%, while NIP-PAMPS/CMSs adsorbed only 1.66 x 10(-3) mmol/g of DBT. It is suggested that the MIP-PAMPS/CMSs had much better adsorption property towards DBT than NIP-PAMPS/CMSs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through nanostructuring to expose sufficient active sites in non-precious metal-based catalysts, both the catalytic activity and stability can be enhanced. Herein, we synthesize cobalt phosphides nanorods anchoring in N-doped carbon nanosheets (NC) (denoted as Co2P/CoP-NC) via a cation-induced strategy derived from zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), followed by phosphorization process. Different cations (Ni2+ and Co2+) are explored to reveal the influence of cations on the phase composition, microstructure, and electrochemical performance of Zn/Co-ZIF-derivatives. By controlling the type and mass of introduced cations (Ni2+/Co2+) in the Zn/Co-ZIF precursor, Co2P/CoP-NC and NiP/Co2P/CoP-NC with different morphologies can be obtained after the phosphorization process, respectively. The optimized Co2P/CoP-NC nanomaterial can possess high bi-functional catalytic activity for both the HER and OER with a small overpotential of 91 and 292 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, respectively, as well as considerable durability. The competitive HER and OER performances are contributed to the 3D sea-urchin-nanostructure, high conductivity, and hetero-interfaces between CoP and Co2P. Co2P/CoP-NC catalyst as the anode and cathode electrodes, respectively, could achieve high electrocatalytic activity with a low applied voltage of 1.61 V at 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline solution, as well as high durability. This work may offer a cation induction method for the controllable design and synthesis of hierarchical nanocatalysts of metal-organic framework derivatives.

Herein, a novel approach of two-step spontaneous reduction is developed to fabricate the 3D rGO-modified Ni foam supported Pd nanoparticles (PRNF) composite for H2O2 electroreduction and electrooxidation. The structure, morphology and composition of the PRNF composite are characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and Raman analysis. Reduced graphene oxidation (rGO) film with ripple-liked wrinkles improves the surface area, electronic conductivity and corrosion resistance in acidic media of Ni substrate and the dispersing degree of Pd particles. The PRNF electrode exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability towards H2O2 electroreduction in NaOH or H2SO4 solutions and electrooxidation in NaOH solutions. In addition, the Al-H2O2 semi-fuel cell and the H2O2-H2O2 fuel cell equipped with the PRNF electrode both deliver a higher power density (278 and 67.2 mW cm(-2) , respectively) and a long term cycle stability (over 50 h). This study introduces a facile and low-cost electrode preparation method which may provide new opportunities to develop high-performance electrodes for energy storage/conversion devices.

Enhancement of Electrochemical Performance of Macroporous Carbon by Surface Coating of Polyaniline	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							CONDUCTIVE POLYMERS; MESOPOROUS WALLS; PORE STRUCTURE; ION SIZE; CAPACITANCE; ELECTRODES; GROWTH; SUPERCAPACITORS; SPHERES; XPS	Conducting polymer-macroporous carbon composite electrode materials were prepared by deposition of a thin layer of polyaniline (PANI) on the surface of three-dimensionally ordered macroporous carbon. A specific capacitance of 1490 F/g was observed over the deposited PANI in the composite electrode. Good rate performance and cycle ability were realized on the composite electrode, attributed to the combined contribution from both the unique properties of the carbon matrix (e.g., highly ordered interconnected pores and good electrical conductivity) and pseudo-capacitance of the deposited PANI layer. The three-dimensionally ordered pore structure of the carbon favored the diffusion of the electrolyte ions, hence not only improving the energy storage capacity but also enhancing power density.

Firstly, a composite method with two-dimensional (2D) boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs), also known as white graphene, was first proposed to improve the Seebeck coefficient of PEDOT:PSS thin film based on an energy filtering effect at the conjunctions. BNNSs were obtained by a facile liquid exfoliation method. Further, a dual-solvent treatment incorporating N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was performed to optimize the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS/BNNSs hybrid thin films. On the one hand, DMF as first treatment can effectively remove part of the redundant non-conductive PSS leading to an increased electrical conductivity. On the other hand, DMSO as second treatment induced a transformation of PEDOT from benzoid to quinoid structure, resulting in a further enhanced electrical conductivity without a reduction in Seebeck coefficient for PEDOT:PSS/BNNSs. Eventually, a remarkable improvement in thermoelectric power factor was achieved to be 100.1 mu W m(-1) K-2 and a large figure of merit (ZT) was estimated to be 0.12 for PEDOT:PSS/BNNSs(5) hybrid thin film at room temperature.

The nanostructures of the hybrid carbon materials are characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the structural dependence of field electron emission properties was investigated. It is found that the hybrid CNTs exhibit exotic morphologies having excellent field electron emission properties. These findings provide a simple synthesis method to assemble the carbon nanomaterials and a new insight into the fundamental understanding of high-performance CNTs towards applications in field-emission devices.

The study focused on the model of film surface, average density and SP3 hybridization fraction under different ion beam incidence angles. The results showed that horizontal kinetic energy of the incident atoms was enhanced by the oblique incident assist ions, thereby the horizontal migration of the C-atoms were also enhanced. The ratio of migration of C-atoms with ion-beam oblique incidence became greater than with verticalineidace, however, the density of the film and SP3 hybridization fraction became smaller. The effect of different ion-beam incident angle on the films structure varies with the variation of assistance/deposition atomic ratio (Ar/C) and incident energy. Thus films with different structures could be obtained when the incidence of ion-beam is oblique.

In this research, BPs were exposed to high electrical current densities under different environments, and the effects on nanotube and BP breakdown were observed. In ambient conditions, SWCNT BP breakdown happened at around 430 degrees C with a flash of light. Mixed BPs of SWCNTs/MWCNTs and SWCNTs/VGCNFs showed higher ignition temperatures of over 500 degrees C. The results were compared to those from thermogravimetric analysis. In a vacuum, current-driven thermal heating from the samples can generate temperatures greater than 2000 degrees C. The breakdown current density increased to more than three times that in open air. The breakdown current density of a BP sample increased proportionally to its conductivity. A finite-element model based on Joule heating and heat convection was used to explain this relationship. Further experiments also proved that the high current-carrying capacity of microscale nanotube array samples improved to 10(6) A cm(-2) due to increased heat dissipation through the substrate.

It possesses a unique micro-mesopore structure with ultra-high specific surface area of 3277.96 m(2) g(-1), and abundant active adsorption sites from the surface doping. These features could not only provide hydrophilic property, but also good electronic/ions conductivities during the deionization processes, facilitating the pseudo-capacitance and total CDI performance.

The dual emissive Au NCs-CDs showed pink fluorescence under UV light, and the dual emission peaks at 625 nm and 444 nm were corresponded to the existence of Hg2+ and Cr6+ respectively. The fluorescence color transformed from pink to blue when in presence of Hg2+. The blue fluorescence emission of CDs selectively quenched by Cr6+, whereas the red fluorescence of BSA-Au NCs was stable against Cr6+, which can be treated as internal reference. The difference response of the two emissions to Hg2+ and Cr6+ resulted in a distinguished fluorescent color change, which can be noticed by the naked eyes clearly. When the Hg2+ and Cr6+ were exposed to the Au NCs-CDs simultaneously, the dual-emission of the Au NCs-CDs were all reduced and exhibited the complete quenching of the pink emission. The detection limits for Hg2+ and Cr6+ were 1.85 nM and 5.34 nM, respectively. Significantly, it was successfully applied to determine the existence of Hg2+ and Cr6+ in real samples, which offered the advantages of simplicity, environmentally friendly and cost saving efficiency.

Accelerating O-Redox Kinetics with Carbon Nanotubes for Stable Lithium-Rich Cathodes	SMALL METHODS			English	Article; Early Access							ANIONIC REDOX; LI; CHALLENGES; BATTERIES	Lithium-rich cathodes (LRCs) show great potential to improve the energy density of commercial lithium-ion batteries owing to their cationic and anionic redox characteristics. Herein, a complete conductive network using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) additives to improve the poor kinetics of LRCs is fabricated. Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy first demonstrates that the slope at a low potential and the following long platform can be assigned to the transition metal and oxygen redox, respectively. The combination of galvanostatic intermittent titration technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further reveal that a battery with CNTs exhibited accelerated kinetics, especially for the O-redox process. Consequently, LRCs with CNTs exhibit a much better rate and cycling performance (approximate to 89% capacity retention at 2 C for over 200 cycles) than the Super P case. Eventually, TEM results imply that the improved electrochemical performance of the CNTs case also benefits from its more stable bulk and surface structures. Such a facile conductive additive modification strategy also provides a universal approach for the enhancement of the electron diffusion properties of other electrode materials.

Eight commonly used chiral triazole fungicides, including penconazole, uniconazole, paclobutrazol, triazolone, tebuconazole, hexaconazole, triticonazole and epoxiconazole were extracted from two environmental water samples (river water and lake water) by magnetic solid-phase extraction, followed by the enantiomeric analysis on a Chiralpark IC column coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry to evaluate their possible stereoselective degradation occurring in the water samples. The possible factors affecting the extraction performance, such as amount of used adsorbents, pH and ionic strength of water solution, types and volumes of desorption solvents were systematically investigated. Under the optimum conditions, extraction yields of eight triazole fungicides were above 80% and the concentration factors were as high as 1000. Method detection and quantification limits for the enantiomers of eight triazole fungicides were in the range of 0.56-6.95 ng/L. Satisfactory accuracy (relative recovery 77.8-93.5%), good intraday precision (RSD 4.3-9.8%) and interday precision (RSD 3.1-7.9%) were also obtained. The developed method provided the simplicity of operation, rapidity and high enrichment factor, which can be used to monitor and evaluate the behavior of the individual enantiomer of chiral triazole fungicides.

A global carbon assimilation system based on a dual optimization method	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CO2; DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; FLUX INVERSION; MODEL; SINKS; TRANSPORT; ENSEMBLE; SENSITIVITY; BALANCE	Ecological models are effective tools for simulating the distribution of global carbon sources and sinks. However, these models often suffer from substantial biases due to inaccurate simulations of complex ecological processes. We introduce a set of scaling factors (parameters) to an ecological model on the basis of plant functional type (PFT) and latitudes. A global carbon assimilation system (GCAS-DOM) is developed by employing a dual optimization method (DOM) to invert the time-dependent ecological model parameter state and the net carbon flux state simultaneously. We use GCAS-DOM to estimate the global distribution of the CO2 flux on 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid cells for the period from 2001 to 2007. Results show that land and ocean absorb -3.63 +/- 0.50 and 1.82 +/- 0.16 Pg C yr(-1), respectively. North America, Europe and China contribute -0.98 +/- 0.15, -0.42 +/- 0.08 and 0.20 +/- 0.29 Pg C yr(-1), respectively. The uncertainties in the flux after optimization by GCAS-DOM have been remarkably reduced by more than 60 %. Through parameter optimization, GCAS-DOM can provide improved estimates of the carbon flux for each PFT. Coniferous forest (-0.97 +/- 0.27 Pg C yr(-1)) is the largest contributor to the global carbon sink. Fluxes of once-dominant deciduous forest generated by the Boreal Ecosystems Productivity Simulator (BEPS) are reduced to -0.78 +/- 0.23 Pg C yr(-1), the third largest carbon sink.

The CDs are rapidly synthesized in a sealed vessel via microwave irradiation within 5min, and they exhibit high quantum yields of 80% with sensitive quenching responses to iron contents. Combined with a microplate fluorescence reader, a rapid and high-throughput assay for ions is further developed. The whole process from the CD synthesis to the detection output can be accomplished within 15min. The limits of detection for Fe3+ in aqueous solution and ferrocene in organic gasoline are determined down to 0.05mM. Furthermore, this method has been successfully used to determine the level of irons in real gasoline for quality evaluation. The results have an excellent agreement with atomic absorption spectrophotometric measurements. The CD-based facile assay with lower cost, use of less sample, and higher-throughput holds great promise as a powerful tool for iron detection in water and organic phase samples.

Herein, the low-cost coal tar pitch is used as a carbon source. NH4Cl is employed as a blowing agent to form 3D honeycomb-like carbons, and followed by KOH chemical activation to form porous structure. The as-prepared porous 3D honeycomb-like carbons possess a large specific surface area of 2881.7m(2)g(-1) with a total pore volume of 2.18cm(3)g(-1). The unique structure allows for exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 324Fg(-1) at a current density of 0.1Ag(-1) in the three-electrode system. Moreover, the assembled symmetric supercapacitors exhibit an energy density of 9.72Whkg(-1) at a power density of 250Wkg(-1) and 6.43Whkg(-1) at a power density of 5000Wkg(-1), and excellent cycle performance of 92.2% retention over 5000 cycles at 1Ag(-1).

Subsequently, the as-prepared GnPs@PDA-MWCNTs were incorporated in poly(phenylene sulfone) (PPSU) via solution blending, followed by hot pressing, to prepare the thermally conducting composites with excellent electromagnetic shielding efficiency. It was observed that the in-plane and through-plane thermal conductivity reached up to 5.4 Wm(-1) K-1 and 3.8 Wm(-1) K-1, respectively, for the composite containing 17.6 vol% GnPs@PDA-MWCNTs, thus, indicating a dramatic increment of 2060% and 1410% compared to the pure PPSU. Moreover, the obtained composites with high electrical conductivity of 183 Sm-1 exhibited profound EMI effectiveness of 62.9 dB, along with excellent thermal stability. Overall, the developed GnPs@PDA-MWCNTs/PPSU composites are promising alternatives for multifunctional applications in electronics, thermal management and EMI protection at high temperatures.

Due to the lack of an effective route for controlling the pore structures, the synthesis of RF resin derived HCS with a high specific surface area for promising applications is still a challenge. In this work, we present a facile and effective template-directed multiple coating route to synthesize RF resin derived HCS with foam-like shells (HCSF). The as-synthesized HCSF exhibit a significantly higher specific surface area (1286 m(2) g(-1)) and larger pore volumes (2.25 cm(3) g(-1)) than the RF resin derived HCS (639 m(2) g(-1) and 0.56 cm(3) g(-1)). Our experiments demonstrated that the cationic surfactant CTAB plays a critical role in forming the foam-like pore structure. Compared with the RF resin derived HCS, the as-synthesized HCSF show advantageous performances in supercapacitor and confined catalysis due to their unique pore structures.

For such a composite with 22.48 wt% of silver and Ag-NPs with the size of 5-10 nm, the initial discharge capacity was 1323 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), and it showed a stable capacity of 320 mA h g(-1) after 150 charge-discharge cycles. It was found that the electrochemical performances of the anode material got better with the increase of the silver content in the composites. Due to the enhanced electric conductivity caused by the silver nanoparticles, as well as the unique three-dimensional cross-linked network structure of the composite, the anode performances in terms of the capacity, cycling stability and rate capacity are significantly improved.

Generating Short-Chain Sulfur Suitable for Efficient Sodium-Sulfur Batteries via Atomic Copper Sites on a N,O-Codoped Carbon Composite	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						metal-organic frameworks; short-chain sulfur molecules; single-atom copper catalysts; sodium-sulfur batteries	FACILE SYNTHESIS; DOPED CARBON; S BATTERIES; LI-S; COBALT; ELECTROCATALYSIS; NANOPARTICLES; ELECTRODES	Sodium-sulfur batteries have attracted attention due to their high energy capacities and low costs, but the dissolution of sodium polysulfides still severely affects their cycle life, limiting their real-world applications. Herein, a stable sulfur host is reported, based on a N,O-codoped carbon composite derived from a bimetallic Cu-Zn metal-organic framework, which ensures high sulfur loading (67 wt%). Most importantly, this composite also includes single-atom copper catalysts, with a high Cu loading of 8.03 wt%. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis show that single atoms of Cu are coordinated with two N and two O atoms within the produced composite material. Those copper sites can weaken S-S bonds in the S-8 ring structure, and thus are able to catalyze the formation of short-chain sulfur molecules in even larger-size pores. In addition, Cu atoms facilitate the conversion between the short-chain sulfur and Na2S. As a result, when the produced sulfur-loaded carbon framework containing the atomic Cu catalyst is used as a cathode for sodium-sulfur batteries, it exhibits superior capacity of 776 mAh g(-1) with a high sulfur utilization (1158 mAh g(s)(-1) normalized with sulfur content) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1), and an excellent rate performance of 483 mAh g(-1) (720 mAh gs(-1)) at 5 A g(-1).

However, massive and efficient fabrication of artificial protection layers on Li metal anode surface remains challenging. Herein, we describe a sandwiched Li metal anode fabricated through a continuous roll to roll calendering method to implant a thin and large-area carbon layer on Li metal anode surface at room temperature. Specifically, a carbon layer ( 3 mu m in thickness) can be entirely grafted from Cu substrate to 50 mu m Li belt surface due to the stickiness of metallic Li. The carbon layer not only plays a critical role in providing rich nucleation sites for Li plating, but more importantly diminishes the metallurgical nonuniformity effects (slip lines) on stripping. Therefore, even Li plating/stripping morphologies are achieved and the as-obtained sandwiched Li/C composite anodes exhibit improved cycling stability both in Li | LiFePO4 and Li | S coin cells and pouch cells. This continuous roll to roll calendering strategy opens a new avenue for grafting various thin artificial protection layers on Li metal surface for safe rechargeable batteries.

The structures and morphologies of the hybrids were investigated by different kinds of techniques, including X-ray diffraction, field-emission electron scanning microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The gas sensing properties of hierarchical rGO/ZnO hybrids toward nitrogen dioxide were studied via a static system. The response of rGO/ZnO hybrids to 50 ppb NO2 was 12, which was seven times higher than that of pristine ZnO at 100 degrees C. The limit of detection could be achieved as low as 5 ppb. The enhanced sensor response was attributed to the presence of local p-n heterojunctions between rGO sheets and hierarchical structure of ZnO. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhao, YC; Li, S; Wang, CA				Zhao, Yucheng; Li, Sa; Wang, Chang-an			Manganous-Manganic Oxide@Carbon Core-Shell Nanorods for Supercapacitors with High Cycle Retention	ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODE; ARRAYS; NANOWIRES; CHARGE; PAPER	Very few research has focused on Mn3O4@carbon nanorod-structured materials for supercapacitor electrode. A facile process has been developed to prepare Mn3O4@carbon core-shell hybrid nanorods for supercapacitor electrode materials. The core Mn3O4 polycrystals, which are 50 nm in diameter and 500 nm in length, offer faradaic pseudo-capacitance, while at the same time they serve as supporting template for 4.5 nm shell carbon surface, which functions as electrically conductive material and is also beneficial for improving the capacitive performance. It is highly desirable that the hybrid nanorods exhibit an excellent cycle ability with 95% retention after 5000 cycles at 4 A g(-1). The hybrid nanorods present a capacitance of 168 F g(-1) and good rate capability (125 F g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)). The results indicate that the Mn3O4@carbon core-shell nanorods may have a promising future in applications which need durable, stable, long-lasting power supply. (C) The Author(s) 2015.

In this work; we demonstrate that the cycling performance of alpha-(Ni/Co)(OH)(2) can be obviously enhanced via the intrinsic pillar effect of metaborate. Combining the high porosity feature of the metaborate stabilized alpha-(Ni/CO)(OH)(2) and the improved electronic conductivity Offered by graphene substrate, the average capacitance fading rate of the metaborate stabilized alpha-(Ni/Co)(OH)(2) is only similar to 0.0017% per cycle within 10 000 cycles at the current density of 5 A g(-1). The rate performance is excellent over a wide temperature range from -20 to 40 degrees C. We believe that the enhancements should mainly be ascribed to the excellent structural stability offered by the metaborate pillars, and the detailed mechanism is discussed.

The preparation is achieved by ammonia activation at different volume fractions of ammonia in the mixture (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) to introduce the nitrogen-containing functional groups and form the original pores and subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at different deposition times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) to further adjust the pore structure. The nitrogen content of ACs-0.1/0.25/0.5/0.75/1 increases gradually from 2.11% to 8.84% with the increase of ammonia ratio in the mixture from 10% to 75% and then decreases to 3.02% in the process of pure ammonia activation (100%), during which the relative content of pyridinium nitrogen (N-6), pyrrolidine (N-5), and graphite nitrogen (N-Q) increase sequentially but nitrogen oxygen structure (N-O) increase continuously. In addition, ACs-0.5 and ACs-0.75, with a relatively high nitrogen content (6.37% and 8.84%) and S-BET value (1048.65 m(2)/g and 814.36 m(2)/g), are selected as typical samples for subsequent CVD. In the stage of CVD, ACs-0.5-60 and ACs-0.75-90, with high S-BET (1897.25 and 1971.57 m(2)/g) value and an appropriate pore-size distribution between 0.5 and 0.8 nm, can be obtained with the extension of deposition time from 60 to 90 min. The results of CO2 adsorption test indicate that an adsorption capacity of ACs-0.75-90, at 800 mmHg, is the largest (6.87 mmol/g) out of all the tested samples. In addition, the comparison of CO2 adsorption performance of tested samples with different nitrogen content and pore structure indicates that the effect of nitrogen content seems to be more pronounced in this work.

Despite carbon/sulphur composites being a more popular research interest than polymer/sulphur composites, improving the cycle performance of sulphur by using polymers is also a major research focus. Therefore, we review the latest developments for polymer/sulphur composites in Li-S batteries. The various polymer/sulphur composites and their impacts on the electrochemical performance are discussed. Meanwhile, the synthesis approaches toward the various polymer/sulphur composites are also summarised. Finally, the future research directions involving polymer/sulphur composites are addressed.

However, the relative poor electronic conductivity is an obstacle to their wide practical application. Herein, the partially-exfoliated graphite paper (EGP) composed of graphene nanosheets is prepared by a controlled cathodic exfoliation. EGP exhibits 3D hierarchical porous structure and good electronic conductivity, which acts as an ideal substrate for growing accordion-like structure NiCo-based bimetal-organic framework (NCMOF). The as-synthesized NCMOF/EGP shows high areal specific capacitance of 2.41 F cm(-2) at 0.5 mA cm(-2), and good rate performance of 72.6% at the current densities from 0.5 to 20 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the constructed NCMOF/EGP//active carbon delivers an energy density of 0.11 mW h cm(-2) at a power density of 0.75 mW cm(-2), and long cycle life. The outstanding electrochemical energy storage performance of NCMOF/EGP are assigned to 3D hierarchical porous structure and good electronic conductivity of EGP combined with layered structure of NCMOF.

Two 44-day incubation experiments were conducted to explore the effects of shallow flooding (SF) on the C mineralization of paddy soil at different temperatures (constant temperatures of 15, 20 and 25 degrees C, and variable temperatures between 15 and 25 degrees C) and rice-straw addition levels (0 to 60 g kg-1 soil), respectively. The results indicated that when compared with the no-flooding (70% water-holding capacity) conditions, the SF conditions could significantly increase the total cumulative C mineralized (C44) at each temperature regime (P < 0.05). The soil bacterial community structures significantly changed with the soil moistures, and the dominant phyla under no-flooding and SF conditions are Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, respectively. When compared with the noflooding treatments, the promoting effects of SF on the C mineralization were observed to gradually decrease with the increasing rice-straw additions to the soil. When the straw addition reached 20 g kg-1 soil, the C44 of the SF treatments was significantly lower than that of the no-flooding treatments (P < 0.05). These results indicated that the straw input levels could determine whether SF promoted the C mineralization in the soil. With the increasing straw additions to the soil, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the near-soil water gradually decreased in the SF treatments, which confirmed that the increased straw additions resulted in more active organic C, and its oxygen-consuming decomposition had resulted in an insufficient oxygen supply in the near-soil water. This may be one of the main reasons that the increasing straw input could restrict the promoting effects of SF on the C mineralization in the soil.

For the first time, we develop a simple approach to fabricate solar-driven superhydrophobic/oleophilic polybenzoxazine/reduced graphene oxide wrapped-cellulose sponge (PBZRGOS) for highly efficiency oil/water separation and rapidly crude oil cleaning up from water. Polybenzoxazine (PBZ) is introduced into the cellulose sponge as a binder to provide low surface energy. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is anchored tightly on the sponge skeleton with the aid of PBZ for fabricating a thermal conductive path. The resultant PBZRGOS with 5% content of RGO (PBZRGOS5) exhibited robust mechanical stability after 100th compression process and maintained ultrahigh oil/water fluxes (up to 107428 Lm(-2) h(-1) bar(-1)) under 0.10 bar as well as high oil/water separation efficiency (99.1%) after 10 cycles, which is superior to other reported modified sponges. Moreover, the light-heat conversion capacity of PBZRGOS driven by solar energy obviously reduce the viscosity of crude oil, speeding up crude oil-diffusion coefficient, and thus achieve the saturated adsorption capacity up to 61.1 g/g with one sun, which is 15.7 times higher than that of the PBZRGOS without sunlight. Therefore, it is expected that this self-heating and superhydrophobic cellulose sponge can be utilized as a competitive functional sponge for cleaning up spilled crude-oil in the large area water body.

The classical Honda & Nishiyama model, c/a = 1 + 0.045 wt%C, was obtained based only on the experimental results for steels containing more than 0.6 wt% of carbon. This model was used to predict that steels containing less than 0.6 wt% of carbon would follow the same relation. However, it was reported by Sherby that the steel with less than 0.6 wt% of carbon is body-centered cubic, and c/a ratio equals to 1. This debate is caused by highly overlapped martensite (002) and (200) peaks when the carbon content of steel is less than 0.6 wt%. In this paper, the martensite lattice parameters of the as-quenched steels with different carbon contents were measured using high-resolution X-ray diffractometer. Rietveld refinement was used to deconvolute overlapped martensite peaks. For the steel with less than 0.6 wt% of carbon, the structure is proved to be body-centered tetragonal. It was found that the relationship between c/a ratio and carbon content follows as c/a = 1 + 0.031 wt%C.

The influence of a hierarchical porous carbon network on the coherent dynamics of a nanoconfined room temperature ionic liquid: A neutron spin echo and atomistic simulation investigation	CARBON			English	Article							ALKYL CHAIN-LENGTH; STRUCTURAL-PROPERTIES; NITROGEN ADSORPTION; MESOPOROUS CARBONS; DOUBLE-LAYER; IMIDAZOLIUM; SCATTERING; HETEROGENEITY; NANOCHANNELS; DIFFUSION	The molecular-scale dynamic properties of the room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, or [C(4)mim(+)][Tf2N-], confined in hierarchical microporous-mesoporous carbon, were investigated using neutron spin echo (NSE) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both NSE and MD reveal pronounced slowing of the overall collective dynamics, including the presence of an immobilized fraction of RTIL at the pore wall, on the time scales of these approaches. A fraction of the dynamics, corresponding to RTIL inside 0.75 nm micropores located along the mesopore surfaces, are faster than those of RTIL in direct contact with the walls of 5.8 nm and 7.8 nm cylindrical mesopores. This behavior is ascribed to the near-surface confined-ion density fluctuations resulting from the ion-ion and ion-wall interactions between the micropores and mesopores as well as their confinement geometries. Strong micropore-RTIL interactions result in less-coordinated RTIL within the micropores than in the bulk fluid. Increasing temperature from 296 K to 353 K reduces the immobilized RTIL fraction and results in nearly an order of magnitude increase in the RTIL dynamics. The observed interfacial phenomena underscore the importance of tailoring the surface properties of porous carbons to achieve desirable electrolyte dynamic behavior, since this impacts the performance in applications such as electrical energy storage devices.

Evolution and recovery of original total organic carbon for carbonate source rocks with different total organic carbon in the Tazhong area, Tarim Basin, China	PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						CSRDTOC; TOCo; TOCo evolution; recovery coefficient; Tazhong area		Source rocks generate and expel hydrocarbon with thermal evolution, which lead to a decrease of total organic carbon (TOC) content. A new quantitative model for original total organic carbon (TOCo) content evolution and recovery was proposed, and then was used to the carbonate source rocks with different TOCs (CSRDTOC) in the Tazhong area, Tarim Basin, China. Studies showed that the higher the TOC of source rocks, the bigger the range of TOC reduction and recovery coefficient. When vitrinite reflectance (VR) is equal to 2.5%, recovery coefficients of TOCo = 0.2%, 0.4%, and 1.0% are 1.43, 1.66, and 2.01, respectively. It must restore TOCo when we evaluate source rocks at the stage of high overmaturity and predict oil and gas resources.	[Huo, Z. P.; Li, S.

Mesoporous MnO2 nanosheets were densely immobilized on an ultrathin titania film precoated with cellulose-derived carbon nanofibers, which gave a hierarchical MnO2-TiO2-carbon nanoarchitecture and exhibited excellent electrochemical performances when used as an anodic material for lithium-ion batteries. The MnO2-TiO2-carbon composite with a MnO2 content of 47.28 wt % exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 677 mAh g(-1) after 130 repeated charge/discharge cycles at a current rate of 100 mA g(-1). The contribution percentage of MnO2 in the composite material is equivalent to 95.1% of the theoretical capacity of MnO2 (1230 mAh g(-1)). The ultrathin TiO2 precoating layer with a thickness ca. 2 nm acts as a crucial interlayer that facilitates the growth of well-organized MnO2 nanosheets onto the surface of the titania-carbon nanofibers. Due to the interweaved network structures of the carbon nanofibers and the increased content of the immobilized MnO2, the exfoliation and aggregation, as well as the large volume change of the MnO2 nanosheets, are significantly inhibited; thus, the MnO2-TiO2-carbon electrodes displayed outstanding cycling performance and a reversible rate capability during the Li+ insertion/extraction processes.

Relationship between carbon isotope discrimination and grain yield in spring wheat under different water regimes and under saline conditions in the ningxia province (North-west china)	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE			English	Article						carbon isotope discrimination; preanthesis drought; salinity; surrogates; Triticum aestivum L	LEAF ASH CONTENT; DURUM-WHEAT; POTENTIAL INTEREST; GAS-EXCHANGE; GENOTYPES; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; EFFICIENCY; TOLERANCE; STABILITY	The relationship between grain yield and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) was analysed in wheat grown under different water regimes in the Ningxia Province (north-west of China). When the association was significant, the relationships between grain yield, Delta and other drought tolerance related traits, such as leaf ash content (m(a)), chlorophyll concentration (Chl), relative water content (RWC), stomatal conductance (g(S)) and the ratio of internal CO2 leaf concentration to ambient CO2 concentration (C-i/C-a), were also examined. Using correlation analysis, the relationships were determined during two consecutive years in a set of 20 spring wheat cultivars (landraces, improved varieties and advanced lines) under rainfed and irrigated conditions, including saline conditions. The relationship between Delta and yield within environments highly depended on the quantity of water stored in the soil at sowing, the quantity and distribution of rainfall during the growth cycle, and the irrigation before anthesis. Delta predicted grain yield under limited irrigation (post-anthesis water stress) but not under pre-anthesis water stress (rainfed conditions), fully irrigated and saline conditions. Under limited irrigation, grain Delta correlated significantly to grain yield leaf m(a) at heading and maturity. It also significantly positively correlated to Chl, RWC, g(S) and C-i/C-a assessed at anthesis. A precise characterization of the timing and intensity of the abiotic constraints experienced by the crop is consequently needed before implementing the use of Delta in wheat breeding programmes.

In order to unravel the impacts of stretching extent on the structural and dynamic properties of water confined in hydrophobic graphene nanochannels with various channel widths (L = 1 nm, 2 nm and 3 nm), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed in this work. It was found that an ultrahigh negative pressure was present in the confined space with the increase of stretching extent before cavitation. The interfacial density peak and tetrahedral arrangement were reduced with the increasing hydrogen bond length, indicating the more disordered structural organization, especially in channels with small channel widths. On the other hand, the hydrogen bond lifetime was increased due to the prolonged stability of the hydrogen bond under stretching. The remarkably increased diffusion coefficients of confined water with the increasing stretching coefficient result from the faster diffusion of interfacial water along the channel surface regardless of channel width. At last, the oscillating tangential pressure profile inside the nanochannels demonstrated that the confined water under stretching consists of multiple layers exhibiting alternate positive and negative pressures, which is reduced with the increase of stretching coefficient, corresponding to the enhanced diffusion.

However, the slow dynamics of the ORR and OER are the key challenges limiting their efficiencies. Transition metals (TMs) and their alloys are promising catalysts for the ORR and OER. Herein, we develop a facile and robust method to prepare TM alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers as efficient bifunctional catalysts for both the OER and ORR. We find that this method can benefit the catalyst design in several ways. Firstly, the compositions of alloys (binary, ternary and quaternary alloys) can be well controlled. Secondly, alloy nanoparticles could be formed and uniformly distributed along the supporting carbon nanofibers which could avoid their aggregation. Additionally, the alloy nanoparticles are encapsulated by carbon layers and nitrogen atoms could be introduced easily into the carbon nanofibers and layers causing changes of their electronic structure, which can then improve the catalytic activity of metal alloy cores. Using this method, we prepared N-doped carbon encapsulating nickel, cobalt and iron alloys with a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 as a bifunctional catalyst with remarkable activities for both the OER and ORR. d-Band theory calculations were used to explain the superior activities of the alloys. The assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery with the as-synthesized NiCoFe@N-CNFs shows a high specific capacity of similar to 845 mA h g(Zn)(-1) with superior charge-discharge cycling durability. This work can provide an ideal platform to study the fundamental mechanism of catalytic processes involving complex metal alloy catalysts and to modify their catalytic activity at the atomic level.

The specific capacitance of commercial LiMn2O4 is enhanced five-fold with a scan rate that is also enhanced 20 times in 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. In addition, the use of water-in-salt electrolyte (5 M LiTFSI) greatly improves the electrochemical performance of the hybrid devices, owing to the larger working window. A high energy density of 202 Wh kg(-1) at power densities of 171 W kg(-1) and 20 Wh kg(-1) at 2571 W kg(-1) were obtained in 5 M LiTFSI.

Herein, a dual metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) pyrolysis strategy is developed to regulate the intrinsic activity and porous structure of the derived catalysts, where a Fe2Ni_MIL-88@ZnCo_zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), with a hierarchically porous structure, multifunctional components, and an integrated architecture, acts as an ideal precursor to obtain multimetal based porous nanorod (FeNiCo@NC-P). Benefitting from the synergetic effect of the multimetal components, facilitated reactant accessibility, and the well-retained integrated structure, the resultant FeNiCo@NC-P catalyst exhibits an oxygen reduction reaction half-wave potential of 0.84 V as well as an oxygen evolution reaction potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the practical application of FeNiCo@NC-P in the zinc-air battery displays a low voltage gap and long-term durability (over 130 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), which outperforms the commercial noble metal benchmarks. This work not only affords a competitive bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries but also paves a new way to design and fabricate MOF-derived materials with tunable catalytic properties.

The core-shell C-MIP was prepared by a reverse microemulsion polymerization method. This method used silica nanoparticles embedded with carbon dots as carriers, acrylamide as the main functional monomer, and N-terminal nonapeptides of EGFR modified by palmitic acid as templates. A series of characterizations (transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) prove the successful synthesis of C-MIP. The fluorescence of C-MIP is quenched by the epitopes of EGFR due to the specific recognition of epitopes of EGFR through their imprinted cavities (analytical excitation/emission wavelengths, 540 nm/610 nm). The linear range of fluorescence quenching is 2.0 to 15.0 mu g mL(-1) and the determination limit is 0.73 mu g mL(-1). The targeted imaging capabilities of C-MIP are demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The laser confocal imaging results indicate that HeLa cells (over-expression EGFR) incubated with C-MIP show stronger fluorescence than that of MCF-7 cells (low-expression EGFR), revealing that C-MIP can target tumor cells overexpressing EGFR. The results of imaging experiments in tumor-bearing mice exhibit that C-MIP has a better imaging effect than C-NIP, which further proves the targeted imaging ability of C-MIP in vivo.

However, the use of Li anodes is hampered due to the growth of Li dendrites upon charging and discharging, which compromises the life and safety of the battery. Here, it is shown that lithiated multiwall carbon nanotubes (Li-MWCNTs) act as a controlled Li diffusion interface that suppresses the growth of Li dendrites by regulating the Li+ ion flux during charge/discharge cycling at current densities between 2 and 4 mA cm(-2). A full Li-S cell is fabricated to showcase the versatility of the protected Li anode with the Li-MWCNT interface, where the full cells could support pulse discharges at high currents and over 450 cycles at different rates with coulombic efficiencies close to 99.9%. This work indicates that carbon materials in lithiated forms can be an effective and simple approach to the stabilization of Li metal anodes.

After calcinations at nitrogen flow, TiO2/C composite materials were prepared. The obtained samples were analyzed by SEM, TEM, XRD and BET. The results indicated that macroporous TiO2/C can remain the three-dimensional ordered structure and TiO2 nanoparticles distributed in the interior of macropores uniformly. Eventually, 3DOM TiO2/C materials were used as a new-type photocatalysts to decompose the methyl orange solution under ultraviolet light, which displayed excellent catalytic activity and regenerative ability.

Green emission in carbon doped ZnO films	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							ZINC-OXIDE FILMS; BLUE LUMINESCENCE; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; DEPENDENCE; THICKNESS	The emission behavior of C-doped ZnO films, which were prepared by implantation of carbon into ZnO films, is investigated. Orange/red emission is observed for the films with the thickness of 60-100 nm. However, the film with thickness of 200 nm shows strong green emission. Further investigations by annealing bulk ZnO single crystals under different environments, i.e. Ar, Zn or C vapor, indicated that the complex defects based on Zn interstitials are responsible for the strong green emission. The existence of complex defects was confirmed by electron spin resonance (ESR) and low temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurement. (C) 2014 Author(s).

In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were introduced to accelerate Fe biodegradation: (I) CNTs acted as cathodes to induce galvanic corrosion owing to their differences in corrosion potential; (II) The large specific surface area of CNTs increased area ratios of cathode to anode; (III) The excellent electrical conductivity of CNTs allowed significant levels of electron transfer through the cathode in galvanic corrosion. Consequently, the degradation rate of Fe/CNTs composites greatly increased by 74% with the increase of CNTs (0.3-0.9 wt%). Further addition of CNTs would lead to corrosion holes and cracks due to localized corrosion. Besides, cell culture experiments showed that MG-63 cells could normally proliferate to maintain their population, indicating good cytocompatibility of Fe/CNTs composites. The results proved that the incorporation of CNTs into Fe was an effective approach to develop Fe-based bone implants with enhanced degradation rates.

Therefore, in order to understand the spatial-temporal variations and controlling mechanisms of global forest carbon (C) storage under future climate change, an improved individual-based forest ecosystem carbon budget model and remote sensing outputs in this study were applied to investigate the spatial-temporal dynamics of global forest (vegetation+soil) C storage in the future climate change scenario. The results showed that in the future RCP4.5 (representative concentration pathways) climate scenario, the total C storage per unit area per year in vegetation and soil of the global forest ecosystem showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing from 2006 to 2100, with an average of 22.77 kg C m(-2)year(-1). However, the evolution trends of C storage changes in vegetation and soil were different. Moreover, the average soil C storage per unit area per year was 2.87 times higher than the average vegetation C storage. The impact of climate change on total C storage in vegetation and soil of the global forest ecosystems was positive, showing an obvious increase during 2006-2100. The total C storage varied significantly in spatial distribution. Spatially, the vegetation C storage and the soil organic C storage were projected to decrease significantly in most parts of South America and southern Africa in the Southern Hemisphere and increase in eastern North America, western Asia, and most areas of Europe in the Northern Hemisphere. Especially in the middle and high latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, the total forest C stock was projected to increase by 30-90% from 2046 to 2100. In the future, in these areas where forest C reserves were predicted to be reduced, it was suggested to increase afforestation, prohibit deforestation, and develop projects to increase forest C. Sustainable forest managements also offered opportunities for immediate mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Our findings provided not only a projection of C storage of global forest ecosystem responses to future climate change but also a useful methodology for estimating forest C storage at global levels.

The proposed biosensor exhibited a high affinity to the substrate of AChE and produced a detectable and fast response owing to its excellent electron transfer rate and satisfactory biocompatibility of GNPs/CS. Nano-PPCPE displayed good electrode chemical behavior, low detection limit and good stability. Nafion (NF) was used as a protective membrane of the AChE biosensor. The AChE biosensor showed favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine iodide (ATChI) with wide linear range (1.0 x 10(-4)-1.0 x 10(-7) M) and an ultralow detection limit of 1.0 x 10(-8) M. Under optimum conditions, the biosensor detected methyl parathion in the linear range from 1.0 x 10(-8) to 1.0 x 10(-14) g/mL with a detection limit of 5,0 x 10(-15) g/mL. The proposed biosensor exhibited good sensitivity, stability, and reproducibility, thus providing a promising analytical tool for pesticide detection.

The direct effects of black carbon aerosols from different source sectors in East Asia in summer	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Black carbon aerosols; Sector emissions; Optical depth; Direct radiative forcing; Climate effects; RegCM4	REGIONAL CLIMATE; ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS; ABSORBING AEROSOLS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; MONSOON; CHINA; MODEL; EMISSIONS; RESPONSES; DUST	Black carbon (BC) aerosol is a significant, short-lived climate forcing agent. To further understand the effects of BCs on the regional climate, the warming effects of BCs from residential, industrial, power and transportation emissions are investigated in Asian regions during summer using the state-of-the-art regional climate model RegCM4. BC emissions from these four sectors have very different rates and variations. Residential and industrial BCs account for approximately 85% of total BC emissions, while power BCs account for only approximately 0.19% in Asian regions during summer. An investigation suggests that both the BC aerosol optical depth (AOD) and direct radiative forcing (DRF) are highly dependent on emissions, while the climate effects show substantial nonlinearity to emissions. The total BCs AOD and clear-sky top of the atmosphere DRF averaged over East Asia (100-130 degrees E, 20-50 degrees N) are 0.02 and +1.34 W/m(2), respectively, during summer. Each sector's BC emissions may result in a warming effect over the region, leading to an enhanced summer monsoon circulation and a subsequent local decrease (e.g., northeast China) or increase (e.g., south China) in rainfall in China and its surrounding regions. The near surface air temperature increased by 0.2 K, and the precipitation decreased by approximately 0.01 mm/day in east China due to the total BC emissions. The regional responses to the BC warming effects are highly nonlinear to the emissions, which may be linked to the influences of the perturbed atmospheric circulations and climate feedback. The nonuniformity of the spatial distribution of BC emissions may also have significant influences on climate responses, especially in south and east China.

The CSs gave rise to an excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in terms of activity and reaction kinetics. They showed particularly superior stability: there was no attenuation of the half-wave potential for CSs-20 h-900 after 13 500 cycles of CV in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. Our results confirmed the significant role of intrinsic defects for high-activity ORR without the need to include other dopants. The study of carbon defects shed fresh light on the true origin of the activity of metal-free ORR catalysts and is fundamentally important and technically promising for promoting the development of other original, low-cost, high-efficiency carbon-based metal-free electrocatalysts.

The conformational change and breakage of DNA induced by the composites were characterized by the integrated tools of electrochemistry, circular dichroism (CD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and DNA electrophoresis. At the early stage of incubation, the DNA double helix conformation was substantially changed by TiO2/CNT composites. Both electrophoresis and electrochemistry results suggested the breakage and damage appeared on the native DNA molecules. When DNA was treated longer by TiO2/CNT, DNA molecules were broken into fragment. AFM images confirmed the process. The DNA damage was deemed to be a gradual process: supercoiled plasmid DNA was first damaged to nicked-circle structure, then further to linear form, and then DNA fragment.

As a result, the potential risk of soil erosion has been inevitably increased with the increases of tractor power, tillage speed, and depth. Tillage erosion, however, has been overlooked as a significant form of soil erosion in this area. Thus, this study aims to 1) provide direct measurements of tillage translocation due to moldboard plowing; and 2) analyze the effect of tillage erosion on the spatial variation of soil organic carbon (SOC). Tillage translocation was determined in a plot experiment using stone chips as tracers. After a single tillage pass, traced soils were translocated 0.095-0.342 m at 32.7-134.1 kg m(-1), with more soil materials translocated in the downslope tillage than in the upslope tillage. The tillage erosivity, expressed in terms of tillage transport coefficient, was 234 kg m(-1) tillage pass(-1). An established Directional Tillage Erosion Model (DirTillEM) was used to predict tillage erosion on the experimental field. High soil loss occurred in the top and lower section of slope, whereas the middle- and bottom section areas reflected soil accumulation. The spatial pattern of SOC exhibited an approximately opposite trend as tillage erosion in the study field, and SOC concentrations were negatively correlated with tillage erosion rates, indicating that tillage erosion likely has contributed to SOC redistribution. The findings suggest that tillage erosion could be a major cause of soil redistribution on sloping farmland in the black soil region of Northeast China; thus, more attention should be given to tillage erosion for its impacts on soil quality and C dynamics in the black soil region.

Here, we report on a binder-free novel aluminium nanolayer-coated polypropylene separator prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique for shuttle-free lithium metal battery applications. A symmetric cell with a modified separator exhibits smooth lithium striping and plating cycles at higher current density under room temperature conditions for an extended time period of 1550h, suggesting better safety and protection of lithium anode from dendrite formation. Coin cells assembled with sulphurized cathode and Li metal as anode in a liquid electrolyte medium using a surface-modified separator display significantly improved specific initial discharge capacity with reasonable reversible discharge capacity and high Coulombic efficiency after 100 galvanostatic cycles at a cycling rate of 0.1C. This result suggests that the aluminium nanolayer-coated separator can effectively help in reduction of polysulphide crossover during the electrochemical process.

Here, flexible porous nanofibers embedded with Co nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (Co@NPCFs) have been synthesized to work as self-standing and binder-free electrodes in flexible ZABs. These unique nanofibers with nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon are beneficial for electron transport, oxygen capture and desorption of the OH- ions. The Co@NPCFs could provide rich active sites and exhibit good catalytic activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction. The fabricated composites with a flexible self-standing network structure can be applied directly to flexible ZABs and contact well with gel electrolyte when bending the batteries. As a result, this strategy provides a good example of flexible self-standing electrodes for ZABs and can also be extended to other flexible electric energy storage devices.

In this work, the polymeric sulfur consisting of -(S-S)(n)-backbone with a high sulfur content (up to 90 wt % S) was reported for the first time. The flexible -(S-S)(n)- chains with high S atom density create an intense "solvating" environment for Li+ conduction, achieving an excellent Li+ conductivity of 1.69 X 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C. Benefiting from its unique thermoplasticity, a hot-rolling process was also developed for fabricating the poly-S membrane. The symmetric solid-state Li cell using the membrane showed a high cycling stability over 300 h. The work offers a novel platform for chemists to design new polymer electrolytes that are quite different with conventional carbon-based polymer electrolytes.

In this study, a methodology for topography modelling of potentially leaked CO2 was devised. Mainstream software was coupled sequentially to build a 3D computing domain for computational fluid dynamics to study the occurrence of CO2 dispersion. The adverse health effects of CO2 were used to establish risk levels and the corresponding CO2 concentration thresholds, and safety boundaries for human health were characterised with a high level of resolution. This methodology can simulate gas diffusion under different sourcesink conditions, and can digitise the spatiotemporal characteristics of CO2 diffusion in less time and using less hardware. It presents a high level of resolution and operability, which is required for project and public health management of CCUS engineering. This novel methodology was applied to assess human health risks in a CCUS engineering oil field in the Yan'an area of Shaanxi province, China. Human health risks in various types of leakage scenarios were systematically evaluated. Pre-control measures were proposed based on the spatial characteristics of the various health risk categories, including the prevention of leakage sources and the setting of safety distances, land use adjustment, and contingency plans. It is worth noting that this study, for the first time, discusses the spatiotemporal evolution of CO2 diffusion and human health risks for trace leakages from the surface source in a CCUS area. The results of this study provide measures for risk mitigation and control for the case study of a CCUS project and propose a complete research framework and data support for similar engineering.

Here, a novel composite photocatalyst of cyano-rich graphitic carbon nitride g-C3N4 is fabricated in a facile manner by sodium chloride-assisted calcination on dicyandiamide. The obtained photocatalysts exhibit superior activity (7.01 mm h(-1) under lambda >= 420 nm, 16.05 mm h(-1) under simulated sun conditions) for H2O2 production and 93% selectivity for 2e(-) ORR, much higher than that of the state-of-the-art photocatalyst. The porous g-C3N4 with Na dopants and cyano groups simultaneously optimize two limiting steps of the photocatalytic 2e(-) ORR: photoactivity, and selectivity. The cyano groups can adjust the band structure of g-C3N4 to achieve high activity. They also serve as oxygen adsorption sites, in which local charge polarization facilitates O-2 adsorption and protonation. With the aid of Na+, the O-2 is reduced to produce more superoxide radicals as the intermediate products for H2O2 synthesis. This work provides a facile approach to simultaneously tune photocatalytic activity and 2e(-) ORR selectivity for boosting H2O2 production, and then paves the way for the practical application of g-C3N4 in environmental remediation and energy supply.

Enzymatic oxidative decolorization of malachite green was used to investigate the catalytic performance of GO-ConA-CPO. The GO-ConA-CPO showed high activity (based on the decolorization efficiency), i.e., 93.68% in 15 min. Moreover, GO-ConA-CPO showed better thermostability and remained higher activity against pH change and high concentrations of oxidant H2O2 compared with GO-CPO and the free enzyme. When incubated at 60 A degrees C for 1.5 h, 63.02% of the activity of GO-ConA-CPO and 35.75% of GO-CPO remained compared with that at 25 A degrees C, while free CPO remained only 8.46% in the same condition. The tolerance of GO-ConA-CPO to H2O2 improved from 2.5 to 6 mmol L-1, and the suitable pH range enlarged from 2.5-3.0 to 2.0-4.5. After 8 cycles, the GO-ConA-CPO can keep 52% activity of that in the first run. The enzymatic kinetic constants indicated that introducing CPO into GO-ConA-CPO bioarchitecture improved the diffusion of reactants and products.

Spurred on by the failures in commercializing Li-S and Na-S batteries, K-Q (Q = S, Se, and SexSy) batteries have entered the sights of researchers because of the low redox potential and natural abundance of element K and its synergistic reaction with S or Se. Unfortunately, the current K-Q battery still suffers from several drawbacks, such as drastic volume change, shuttling phenomenon, relatively low reactivity, and dendrite growth. To help to push forward progress of the K-Q battery, here in this review, we first introduce the operation principle and the fundamental challenges faced by the current K-Q batteries, followed by a comprehensive review of effective strategies that have been developed, including engineering of the electrode structure and optimization of the battery composition. Discussions of the mechanism are also included to deepen the understanding of such battery systems. Finally, we discuss the perspectives and challenges for practical application of K-Q batteries. We hope the insights provided in this review can shed light on this new yet rapidly developing field and offer guidance for the development of future high-performance K-Q batteries.

However, both the low density of Fe-Nx active sites and their less utilization render these catalysts inefficient. To address these issues, a synergistic polymer-silicon dual templates strategy is reported to fabricate dense SA Fe-Nx sites on mesoporous carbon spheres (SA-Fe-Nx-MPCS). Thanks to the dense and accessible SA Fe-Nx sites, the SA-Fe-Nx-MPCS exhibits better ORR catalytic activity and stability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the SA-Fe-Nx-MPCS result in a 3D porous framework with abundant channels in air cathode, facilitating mass transfer and enhancing accessibility of Fe-Nx moieties. The assembled aluminum-air flow battery exhibits a large peak power density of 130 mW cm-2 and a high gravimetric energy density of ca. 2905 Wh kgAl- 1, as well as a superior stable discharging voltage over 300 h.

Most explored materials today are carbon particle materials, which have high surface areas for charge storage. But in spite of these large specific surface areas, the charges physically stored on the carbon particles in porous electrode layers are unfortunately limited. Regarding advanced supercapacitor electrodes, metal oxides are considered the most promising material for the next generation of supercapacitors owing to their unique physical and chemical properties. In this chapter, the rational design and fabrication of metal oxide nanostructures for supercapacitor applications are addressed.

Experiments are performed in standard electrolyte for Li-S batteries at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) with a Li plating charge fixed at 1 mAh cm(-2). A fully dense Li film (4.8 mu m thick) is initially electrodeposited on the Cu electrode. However, from the 2nd Li plating/stripping cycle, Li deposit becomes porous to reach a thickness of 9.6 mu m at the 27th cycle, corresponding to a film porosity of 50%, favoring its collapse during the subsequent cycles. When a carbon paper with a low surface area (0.02 m(2) g(-1)) is used as a substrate, Li deposition occurs preferentially in the pores of the carbon paper during the first few cycles. However, this does not prevent the formation of Li dendrites, which progressively extend on the top of the substrate, resulting in the degradation of the electrode cyclability after about 40 cycles. The use of a carbon paper with a higher surface area (4.2 m(2) g(-1)) favors Li deposition inside the electrode, with no apparent loss of cyclability after 50 cycles. However, this does not prevent the formation of dead Li, as suggested by the continuous and irreversible expansion of the electrode over cycling at a mean rate of 1.3 mu m per cycle. Additionally, a large and irreversible expansion of 38 mu m is observed during the first cycle, which is attributed to the lithium-solvent co-intercalation in the graphitic part of the carbon paper substrate.

Therefore, it is necessary to further enhance the affinity between sulfur hosts and polysulfides, and relieve the shuttle effects in the Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a novel vertical 2-dimensional (2D) p-SnS/n-SnS2 heterostructure sheets which grown on the surface of rGO. The excellent electrochemical properties of SnS- SnS2@rGO as Li-S cathode are ascribed to the stronger absorption effect of metal sulphides for polysulfides and the smooth trapping-diffusion-conversion effect of p-SnS/n-SnS2 heterostructure for polysulfides. As a conductive carrier for the growth of vertical 2D p-SnS/n-SnS2 heterostructure nanosheets, rGO can protect the steadiness and enhance the cycle stability of electrode, compared with heterostructure without rGO. In addition, the built-in electric field in the 2D p-SnS/n-SnS2 heterostructure during the discharge/charge processes can effectively accelerate charge transfer, and the charge transfer mechanism in SnS-SnS2 heterostructure during cycling has been investigated. At a rate capability of 2C, the designed SnS-SnS2@rGO as Li-S cathode delivers high specific capacities of 907 mAh g(-1) and 571 mAh g(-1) after the first cycle and 500 cycles, respectively, which shown excellent cycling ability.

In this work, we scalably prepare a highly active ORR electrocatalyst which consists of both Fe3N nanoparticles and Fe-N-C active sites in N-doped carbon frameworks (named as Fe3N/Fe-N-C) and derives from walnut shells as precursors followed by iron ion incorporation and a pyrolysis process in NH3 atmosphere. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements strongly evidence the coexistence of Fe3N nanoparticles and iron-nitrogen-carbon active sites. Benefiting from the synergistic mechanism between Fe3N nanoparticles and Fe-N-C sites in N-doped carbon frameworks, the resultant catalyst presents desirable ORR performance with impressive E-onset, E-1/2, higher long-term stability, and satisfactory resistance to methanol interference, overtopping commercial Pt/C catalyst. The present research not only proposes a cost-effective and available ORR electro-catalyst to substitute Pt-based catalysts, but also provides a reliable and versatile technology to realize large-scale preparation for practical applications.

In this work, copper nanoparticles accommodated in porous carbon substrates (Cu NP@PC), synthesized by calcinating the filter papers impregnated with copper ions at high temperature, were designed as the electrode active materials for electrochemical sensing of glucose. During the formation of porous carbon, the copper nanoparticles spontaneously accommodated into the formed voids and constituted the half-covered composites. For the electrochemical glucose oxidation, the prepared Cu NP@PC composites exhibit much superior catalytic activity with the current density of 0.31 mA/cm(2) at the potential of 0.55 V in the presence of 0.2 mM glucose. Based on the high electrochemical oxidation activity, the present Cu NP@PC composites also exhibit a superior glucose sensing performance. The sensitivity is determined to be 84.5 mu A /(mmol(.)L) with a linear range of 0.01 similar to 1.1 mM and a low detection limit (LOD) of 2.1 mu mol/L. Compared to that of non-porous carbon supported copper nanoparticles (Cu NP/C), this can be reasonable by the improved mass transfer and strengthened synergistic effect between copper nanoparticles and porous carbon substrates.

The stability of MnN4-CNT is confirmed by the first-principles molecular dynamics simulation. According to the energetic calculations, CO and O-2 prefer to anchor at the MnN4 site and the adsorption of CO is slightly more favorable than O-2. The three reaction mechanisms of CO oxidation on the MnN4-CNT are explored, namely, Eley-Rideal, Langmuir-Hinshelwood, and a "new" termolecular Eley-Rideal, respectively. It is found that the termolecular Eley-Rideal reaction mechanism is the most favorable one and the energy barrier for the rate-limiting step is merely 0.69 eV. Our results suggest the high catalytic activity of MnN4-CNT for CO oxidation at room temperature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, little has been documented regarding soil aggregate stability with grassland degradation in the alpine region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). In this study, we used physical and density fractions to elucidate the mechanisms of differences in SOC in non-degraded and degraded grasslands of two grassland biomes, alpine meadow and alpine steppe in the QTP. There were considerable differences between non-degraded and degraded grasslands for the soil physical and chemical properties, aggregate distribution and aggregate-SOC content. The non-degraded alpine meadow (AMND) had the largest value among all the alpine grasslands for the SOC content of the microaggregate fraction, with values of 31.83 g kg(-1). The degraded grasslands showed significantly larger SOC content of macroaggregates than non-degraded grasslands. The degraded alpine steppe (ASD) had the largest SOC content, with the value of 25.51 g kg(-1). The aggregate distribution of the macroaggregate, microaggregate and free silt+clay fractions was consistent with the variation in SOC content of these three aggregate fractions. The fine intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (fiPOM) content was significantly less in degraded grasslands, indicating that grassland degradation might have disrupted the fiPOM-C. The increase in CO2 emissions was related to the destruction of soil aggregates in the alpine grasslands of the QTP. Highlights Effects of alpine grassland degradation on aggregate-associated SOC were investigated. Used soil aggregate fractions to evaluate the variation of aggregate-associated SOC. Grassland degradation promoted the destruction of soil aggregates in the alpine grasslands of the QTP. Destruction of soil aggregates promoted CO2 emissions in the degraded alpine grasslands of the QTP.

However, success in super-resolution imaging relies heavily on their blinking characteristics. We here report easily prepared and photostable nanoparticles, carbon dots (CDs), with desirable fluorescence blinking for high-density super-resolution imaging. The CDs exhibit a low duty cycle (similar to 0.003) and high photon output (similar to 8000) per switching event, as well as show much higher resistance to photobleaching than Alexa 647 or Cy5 typically used in single molecule localization microscopy. The stable blinking of CDs allows to perform high-density localization imaging at a resolution of 25 nm by sequentially recording the particle positions. The CD-based super-resolution imaging is further demonstrated by rendering CD-stained tubular peptide self-assemblies, CD-packed clusters with well-defined patterns, and CD-stained microtubules in a cell. Furthermore, this method has been validated as a valuable tool to detect the clustering and distribution of protein receptors in the plasma membrane that are not discerned with normal fluorescence imaging.
