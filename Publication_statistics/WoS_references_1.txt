N-GCNTs microspheres are consisted of sucrose, graphene and water-soluble carbon nanotubes and are named according to different mass ratio, like N-GCNTs-1 (1:1:1), N-GCNTs-2 (1:3:1) and N-GCNTs-3 (1:5:1). N-GCNTs-2 microspheres have 3D porous structure with abundant of N atoms which is constituted by the intertwine of nanotubes and graphene, and maintained the characteristics of 1D and 2D nano-carbon. By contrast, N-GCNTs-1 microspheres shows broken microspheres connected by a few CNTs, and N-GCNTs-3 microspheres expose the smoother and integrated spheres which are hardly found CNTs. N-GCNTs-2 microspheres mainly manifest the eminent physical characterization for big BET specific surface area (575.8 m(2)g(-1)) and pore volumes (0.303568 cm(3)g(-1)) and high sulfur content (87.5%). Moreover, N-GCNTs-2 microspheres show the high initial discharge capacities of 1465.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, good cycle stability of 1315.1 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles and outstanding long-term cycling performance of 849.1 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 2.0 C. The N-GCNTs-2 microspheres effectively enhance the electrochemical performance of cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries due to 3D hierarchical porous structure and successful N-doping.

With a high sulfur content of 75.1 wt %, the conductive, highly porous composite electrode delivers a high discharge capacity of 512 mA h/g after 250 cycles at a current rate of 1 C with a low capacity decay of 0.128% per cycle. The excellent capacities and cyclic stability arise from several unique functional features of the cathode. (i) The conductive graphene aerogel framework ameliorates ion/electron transfer while accommodating the volume expansion induced during discharge, and (ii) TiO2 nanoparticles play an important role in restricting the dissolution of polysulfides by chemical bonds with sulfur.

Sulfur infiltration and allotrope formation in porous cathode hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; melt and vapor infiltration; pore size distribution in cathode; sulfur allotropes	CARBON-NANOTUBES; GRAPHITE OXIDE; GRAPHENE; FIBER; SUPERCAPACITORS; ELECTRODES; POROSITY; FLOW	We investigate sulfur infiltration and formation of lower order allotropes in heated porous hosts during fabrication of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cathodes. Sulfur existence in cathode ultramicropores has been an important question for Li-S batteries, as ultramicropores reduce the polysulfides "shuttle effect" but also delay sulfur dissolution and Li+ ion diffusion in the trapped solid sulfur. A novel continuum-level model is presented including heat transfer and sulfur infiltration, either from the top of a porous host or from the porous host particle surface, and taking into account the pore size distribution. A novel decay factor in modeling sulfur infiltration incorporates the pore wall repulsion energy and allotrope formation energy (predicted by density functional theory [DFT] simulations). Simulations are performed for a microporous carbon fabric host and an activated carbon powder host with bimodal micropore and macropore size distribution, with Raman and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) spectroscopy confirming the predicted existence of linear S-6 and S-4 in ultramicropores.

The dissolution/loss of lithium polysulfide is more serious at low rates, because there is enough time for lithium polysulfide to diffuse to the negative electrode, which leads to poorer cycle stability at low rates than at high rates. Here, a network of carbon nanofibers (NCNFs) is prepared by carbonizing the composite nanofibers of polyacrylonitrile and ZIF-8, which can be used to form composite with sulfur. However, due to poor conductivity and large pore size of NCNFs, the composite delivers low specific capacity and shows poor cycle stability. After coating with a layer of PEDOT:PSS, the conductivity and the dissolution/loss of lithium polysulfide are effectively addressed. As a result, the composite electrode with a sulfur loading up to 3.4 mg exhibits a maximum specific capacity of 793 mAh/g at 0.1 C, which remains to be 623 mAh/g even after 200 cycles. The PEDOT:PSS coating effectively improves the low current rate cyclability, which is a challenge for lithium-sulfur batteries.

But, there are some problems that need to be solved urgently. In this work, an environmentally friendly, green, and low-cost ZIF-67-derived cobalt-based sulfate material (CoSO4) combined with carbon nanotubes was proposed as a sulfur host material. Experiments show that the addition of CoSO4 can significantly enhance the transformation of polysulfide and suppress the shuttle effect. The best performance is the CNT-CoSO4-2/S, which has an initial capacity of 1356.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C current density. Furthermore, long-term cycle test was carried out at a current density of 0.2 C; the coulombic efficiency was above 98.63% after 200 cycles. This work demonstrates the potential of cobalt-based sulfates as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Using high definition IR imaging combined with a temperature-voltage data acquisition system, XPS and SEM, careful analysis of the thermal and electrochemical behaviors, chemical compositions and evolution of electrode structure of Li-S pouch cells is performed. Furthermore, the failure mechanism of Li-S pouch cells has been proposed for the first time. Based on the mechanism, an important self-protection "insulated seal" and overcharge without triggering safety hazards in Li-S pouch cells are identifed and elucidated in decal. Meanwhile, a pivotal strategy to address thermal runaway in Li-S pouch cells under abuse conditions is proposed by designing and fabricating a thermally conducive separator accordingly. The as-made carbon coated (LA132-C) separator shows in-plane thermal conductivity of 8.43 W m(-1)K(-1), which is 228% of commercial separators. The practical application of the as-made separator is highlighted by evaluating Li-S pouch cell to meet the standards for all abuse tests and delivers a high capacity retention rate of 87.7% over 30 cycles at 0.05C under lean electrolyte condition (E/S = 4.3).

However, the rampant diffusions of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the electrolyte induced the shuttle effect between anode and cathode, resulting in low sulfur utilization, low energy efficiency and short cycling life. Herein, we prove the rational design and construction of Ni nanoparticles filled in vertically grown N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on graphene nanosheets (Ni@NG-CNTs) as efficient polysulfide barrier for high-performance LSBs. The unique design integrates graphene nanosheets and CNTs into hierarchical architectures with one-dimensional (1D) CNTs, two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanosheets and abundant carbon nanocages. This design provides large surface area for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) adsorption, accelerates electron transport and enhances electrochemical redox of LiPSs. Benefiting from the unique structural features, the LSBs with the Ni@NG-CNTs as polysulfide barrier keep high reversible specific capacities of 309.1 and 265.0 mAhg(-1) at 5 and 10 C rates after 500 cycles. This work provides a new strategy for constructing self-assembled hybrids of CNTs and graphene nanosheets with abundant carbon nanocages for high-performance LSBs.

Insight into lithium-sulfur batteries: Elementary kinetic modeling and impedance simulation	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Modeling; Simulation; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; EIS; Polysulfides	FUEL-CELLS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK	We present a model of the lithium sulfur (Li/S) battery based on a multi-step, elementary sulfur reduction mechanism including dissolved polysulfide anions. The model includes a description of the evolution of solid phases in the carbon/sulfur composite cathode as well as multi-component (Li+, PF6-, S-8 ,S-8(2-), S-6(2-), S-4(2-), S-2(2-), S2-) mass and charge transport in the liquid electrolyte. The chemical reaction mechanism consists of a Li/Li+ oxidation reaction at the anode and a six-step polysulfide reduction mechanism at the cathode. The modeling framework allows for the simulation of charge and discharge profiles as well as electrochemical impedance spectra. The latter are obtained via a voltage step/current relaxation technique based on the physicochemical model without the need for applying equivalent circuit models. The results indicate that the discharge behavior of this Li/S cell is governed by the presence of solid reactant and product phases in exchange with the dissolved polysulfide anions. The first and last stages of the discharge are characterized by the presence of solid S-8 and Li2S, respectively, while the intermediate stage corresponds to a situation where all chemical compounds are dissolved in the electrolyte.

However, the diffusion and dissolution of intermediate polysulfides and volume changes result in a rapid decay of capacity. In this work, an acidifying acetylene black/carbon nanotubes@sulfur (H-AB/CNTs@S) hybrid electrode material with a 3D interlinked network structure has been synthesized by grafting polyethylene glycol (PEG) and then depositing elemental sulfur on the commercial H-AB/CNTs hybrid surface. The H-AB/CNTs@S hybrids are characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical methods. The H-AB/CNTs hybrid substrate provides electrons and Li ion transfer pathway for the sulfur electrode. The PEG chains with abundant hydrophilic functional groups can help alleviate the diffusion of hydrophilic polysulfides. As a result, the H-AB/CNTs@S hybrid electrode with PEG delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1380mAhg(-1) at a current density of 0.1C and remains at 923mAhg(-1) after 100cycles.

Pretreated attapulgite was utilized as the carrier of elemental sulfur and the attapulgite-sulfur-polypyrrole (AT @400 degrees C-S-PPy) composite with 50 wt.% sulfur was obtained. The structure and morphology of the composite were characterized with infrared spectroscopy (IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An AT @400 degrees C-S-PPy composite was further utilized as the cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. The first discharge specific capacity of this kind of battery reached 1175 mAh/g at a 0.1 C current rate and remained at 518 mAh/g after 100 cycles with capacity retention close to 44%. In the rate test, compared with the polypyrrole-sulfur (PPy-S) cathode material, the AT @400 degrees C-S-PPy cathode material showed lower capacity at a high current density, but it showed higher capacity when the current came back to a low current density, which was attributed to the "recycling" of pores and channels of attapulgite. Therefore, the lamellar composite with special pore structure has great value in improving the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides hinders the commercialization of LSBs. Effectively improving the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the sulfur cathode still represents a significant challenge. Here, a MoN@CMK-5 composite with a bimodal pore system was designed to electrocatalytically mediate Li/S conversion chemistry. MoN@CMK-5 presents a large specific surface area (1012 m(2) g(- 1)) and two sets of tunnels with pore sizes of 3.63 and 3.47 nm, which efficiently adsorb polysulfides and accelerate the mass transfer of electrolytes. Furthermore, MoN has high intrinsic cata-lytic activity and enables the rapid conversion of polysulfides. Owing to the synergistic "adsorption-conversion-mass transfer " effect, the electrochemical reaction kinetics are effectively enhanced. Consequently, the MoN@CMK-5/S electrode achieves excellent performance with an initial capacity of 1582 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and retains a reversible capacity of 658.4 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1C. The cathode delivers a specific capacity of 475.8 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 5C, with a capacity decay as low as 0.027% per cycle during 1000 cycles. In addition, theoretical calculations reveal that MoN@CMK-5/S exhibits low activation energy for Li2S decomposition and effectively inhibits the shuttling of polysulfides. This work provides a new avenue for the development of high-performance LSBs.

Herein, we first prepare oxidized holey carbon nanotubes (O-H-CNTs) through a controlled air etching strategy, then exploit them as the carbon precursor to produce nitrogen-doped holey carbon nanotubes(N-H-CNTs). The influence of air etching degree on the morphology, structure, composition, conductivity and post-doping effect of O-H-CNTs is discussed in detail. The optimized O-H-CNTs-2 (2 refers to etching time) display unique holey structure and obtain a certain amount of structure defects while retaining good conductivity. After N doping, the resultant N-H-CNTs-2 host exhibits improved conductivity and promoted sulfur dispersibility. More importantly, the unique holey structure and effective N doping endow them with strengthened dual trapping capability for polysulfides. Therefore, the N-H-CNTs-2/S cathode shows much enhanced cycling lifespan and rate performance. It delivers a high discharge capacity of over 750 mAh/g even after 500 cycles, and high rate capacity of similar to 560 mAh/g at 4 C. Clearly, our work provides a good guidance on the design and exploitation of excellent sulfur host by rationally regulating the structure, composition and conductivity.

Herein, hierarchically porous carbon with enriched pyridinic nitrogen (N-HPC) is fabricated via a simple acid treatment of oxide graphene, NH4+ electrostatic adsorption and subsequent thermal treatment. Benefiting from the hierarchically porous structure and high pyridinic nitrogen doping, N-HPC can improve sodium-ion storage and Li-S batteries. In the SIBs, NHPC delivers a high reversible sodium storage capacity and an ultrahigh rate performance because the optimized surface area and optimal nitrogen doping can provide abundant active sites, defects, voids and excellent electrical/electron conductivity. Importantly, kinetic analysis and in situ Raman spectroscopy results reveal adsorption-intercalation mechanisms for Na+ storage in N-HPC. Furthermore, Li-S batteries, used N-HPC coated separator, display high-rate capacity and excellent cycling stability because of effective physical shield, the strongest capture ability of the lithium polysulfides and low dissociated energy of Li2S. Moreover, in situ Raman spectroscopy investigation and theoretical calculation verify the effectively reduced polysulfides shuttling and electron-withdrawing pyridinic N of N-HPC.

However, the application of Li-S batteries is prevented by a series of primary problems, including low electronic conductivity, volumetric fluctuation, poor loading of sulfur, and shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfides. Here, a novel composite structure of sulfur nanoparticles attached to porous-carbon nanotube (p-CNT) encapsulated by hollow MnO2 nanoflakes film to form p-CNT@Void@MnO2/S composite structures is reported. Benefiting from p-CNTs and sponge-like MnO2 nanoflake film, p-CNT@Void@MnO2/S provides highly efficient pathways for the fast electron/ion transfer, fixes sulfur and Li2S aggregation efficiently, and prevents polysulfide dissolution during cycling. Besides, the additional void inside p-CNT@Void@MnO2/S composite structure provides sufficient free space for the expansion of encapsulated sulfur nanoparticles. The special material composition and structural design of p-CNT@Void@MnO2/S composite structure with a high sulfur content endow the composite high capacity, high Coulombic efficiency, and an excellent cycling stability.

As an electrode material for lithium-ion batteries, the composite with 13 wt % reduced graphene oxide delivers 1886.3 and 1322.3 mAh g(-1) specific capacities for the initial discharge and charge, respectively, resulting in 70.1% of Coulombic efficiency, and has a good capacity retention with 1181.9 mAh g(-1 )after 50 cycles, much higher than that of pure vanadium sulfide submicrospheres. It exhibits a good cycling stability and an enhanced high-rate capability. Lithium storage mechanism is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrum and discharge-charge measurements. The results show that the vanadium sulfide with reduced graphene oxide composite can convert to sulfur + vanadium with reduced graphene oxide composite after the first cycle, and the reduced graphene oxide can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfide while metal vanadium increases electrode electronic conductivity, leading to an enhanced electrochemical performance. The composite is proved to be a promising functional material associated with lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Li/S cell showed the first discharge capacity of 1286 mAh/g-S, which utilized is 71% of the theoretical value. It decreased to 328 mAh/g-S at the 100th cycle, which corresponds to about 19% utilization of the total sulfur in the cathode. The spherical lumps of the reaction product were observed on the surface of the sulfur electrode. This material was verified as lithium sulfide by X-ray diffraction measurement. The pores in the separator were filled with reaction product. Thus the diffusion of the Li(+) ion decreased, which resulted in the decreased capacity of the Li/S cell.

Heteroatom doping on mesoporous carbon by synthesizing with heteroatom containing ligands (pre-synthetic process) or incorporating heteroatom-containing compounds during pyrolysis (post-doping) can further enhance its electrochemical properties. Although both methods have been applied to increase the doping content, the effects of the pre-synthetic process and post-doping have not yet been systematically studied. Herein, we have synthesized mesoporous carbon derived from sulfur-containing MOFs for the first time using 2,5-disulfanylterephthalic acid as a ligand and added dopants (melamine for N-doping and thiourea for N,S-codoping). We systematically compared the performance of mesoporous carbon as cathodes for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with previous studies, which used terephthalic acid and its analogues as pre-synthetic ligands and various dopants as post-doping sources. Our work showed the synergetic effect of heteroatoms from dual-doping process-especially sulfur (S from pre-synthetic process and N,S from post-doping), which not only enhanced catalytic activity (limiting current density (J(L)) of -5.19 mA.cm(-2)), stability, and methanol tolerance as an ORR catalyst but also rendered superior stability of 85.2% over 100 cycles as a cathode of Li-S batteries.

However, their practical application is impeded by the lithium polysulfide shuttle effect causing rapid capacity fading. Herein, a novel scaly N-doped carbon/Mo-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2@Mo) composites as sulfur-wrapping host for lithium-sulfur batteries are prepared. This host not only can physically adsorb polysulfides due to the unique scaly carbon structure with a rough surface and large specific surface area, but also chemically adsorb polysulfides and effectively inhibit the shuttle effect from the Ti-O bond. As cathode for lithium-sulfur battery, 0.2 N-TiO2@Mo/S shows a high-capacity maintenance (70.41%, 83.97%, and 95.04% after 30, 50, and 50 cycles at 0.2, 0.5, and 1 C) and a low-capacity degradation (0.091% per each cycle for 200 cycles). Moreover, the cathode delivers a smallest voltage gap (0.18 V) between oxidation and reduction plateaus and a high Q(low)/Q(high) (2.43 at 0.1 C). This work offers a promising avenue and provides a new guide to high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, combining the advantages of multidimensional carbon materials, S/C composites consisting of sulfur and Activated Carbon (AC), Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), Graphene (G) were obtained in a closed system at 155 degrees C, and 3D electrodes were prepared using porous aluminum (PAl) as current collectors. The as-obtained electrode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1256 mAh/g at 0.1C, about 200 mAh/g higher than that of the electrode using traditional non-porous aluminum (NPAl) current collector. As NPAl is substituted by PAl, the oxidation peak current density of S/C composite is increased from 3.59 to 4.95 A/g, and the charge transfer resistance is decreased from 32.03 to 17.37 Omega. In comparison with the very poor performance of S/C using NPAl at 60 degrees C, the initial discharge capacity of S/C using PAl can reach 803 mAh/g at 1C rate with a capacity retention rate of 71.7% after 50 cycles, while the corresponding stress decreases to 10.35 MPa. The improved mechanisms of S/C composites using PAl were discussed. Porous aluminum is attractive to improve the electrochemical performance and safety of batteries.

However, it is still preventing the shuttle effect poorly due to the weak interaction between nonpolar carbon and polar polysulfide (LiPS). Herein, we report a facile method to prepare polar hierarchically porous carbon by in-situ loading the different amounts of zinc-based active sites (p-HPC-X) onto the HPC materials. The close combination of a carbon interconnected skeleton and ZnS nanoparticles derived zinc-based active sites forms the strong interaction that suppresses the soluble polysulfide shuttle effect and catalyzes the kinetics redox reactions of lithium polysulfide/sulfide. Moreover, the effect of polar sites introduced in situ on the morphology/porosity of carbon materials is also focused on. Crystallization of zinc-based active sites during the freeze-drying process and self-assembly during carbonization allow the pore size distribution of porous carbon to be customized, which offers fast lithium ion and electron transport channels. Due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical pore structure and suitable polarity sites, the p-HPC-X exhibits high capacity and good cycling performance. Especially p-HPC1, it yields a high reversible capacity of 683.7 mAh g(-1) and a low fading rate of 0.041% per cycle over 900 cycles at a current density of 1 C. This work offers novel insights into realizing the effect of in-situ loaded active sites on pore structure and electrochemical performance in LSBs. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Novel host materials, which are designated to suppress the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) into electrolyte, play critical roles to solve the long-term cycling problem in LSB. Herein, the porous structured N deficient g-C3N4 (NDCN) material is developed to construct advanced cathode in LSB through a simple fabrication strategy. The obtained NDCN exhibits a unique 3D architecture with abundant macro-and meso-pores to host S and facilitate ion transport, while the abundant active sites provide strong adsorption towards LiPS. As a result of these above merits, LSB based on S@NDCN cathode delivers an excellent long-term cycling stability with a decay rate of 0.045% per cycle over 300 cycles at 1C.

Vapor-Phase Atomic-Controllable Growth of Amorphous Li2S for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS NANO			English	Article						atomic layer deposition; lithium-sulfur battery; nanoscale Li2S films	MESOCARBON MICROBEADS MCMB; LAYER DEPOSITION; ION BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIAL; HIGH-CAPACITY; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; ENERGY-STORAGE; GRAPHENE OXIDE; FILM GROWTH	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries hold great promise to meet the formidable energy storage requirements of future electrical vehicles but are prohibited from practical implementation by their severe capacity fading and the risks imposed by Li metal anodes. Nanoscale Li2S offers the possibility to overcome these challenges, but no synthetic technique exists for fine-tailoring Li2S at the nanoscale. Herein we report a vapor-phase atomic layer deposition (ALD) method for the atomic-scale-controllable synthesis of Li2S. Besides a comprehensive investigation of the ALD Li2S growth mechanism, we further describe the high performance of the resulting amorphous Li2S nanofilms as cathodes in Li-S batteries, achieving a stable capacity of similar to 800 mA.h/g, nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency, and excellent rate capability. Nanoscale Li2S holds great potential for both bulk-type and thin-film high-energy Li-S batteries.

In this work, N and S co-doped mesoporous carbon was prepared by a novel egg shell template method and utilized to modify the separator for high performance Li-S batteries. The discharge capacity of the second cycle retained at 1467 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 200 cycles and decayed at 0.20% per charge discharge cycle, and a reversible capacity of 561 mAh g(-1) was achieved even at 5 C rate after 200 cycles. The prepared material showed a porous hollow sphere morphology with larger surface area and N and S co-doped that can provide great electrochemical property as well as surface chemistry for the adsorption of the intermediate polysulfides. After separator modification, XPS analysis revealed that pyrrolic-type N, pyridinic-like N, and thiosulphate were the major factors contributing to the superior electrochemical performance of the CS/S cathode. This work also provided a rational design strategy for the modification of separator to effectively utilize the active sulfur and to retard the migration of dissolved polysulfides, which enhanced the performance of high energy density Li-S batteries with long cycling life.

Double-Shelled Co3O4/C Nanocages Enabling Polysulfides Adsorption for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						double-shelled structure; lithium-sulfur batteries; metal oxides; polysulfides; chemical adsorption	LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES; LI-S BATTERIES; CYCLE LIFE; CATHODE; GRAPHENE; MEDIATOR; ELECTRODE; CHALLENGES; TEMPLATES; CHEMISTRY	Rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, which originate from the merits of extraordinary theoretical specific energy density, abundant resources, and eco-friendly character, have received ever-growing attention. However, their practical applications are seriously hampered because of the poor conductive property of the sulfur and the discharging products, severe dissolution and migration of lithium polysulfide intermediates, and huge volumetric variation of sulfur particles upon cycling. Here, double-shelled Co3O4 and carbon (Co3O4/C) hollow nanocages as sulfur host materials are reported. The double-shelled structures can significantly boost the adsorption of soluble polysulfides and the electrical conductivity of sulfur cathodes. Consequently, the prepared S@Co3O4 /C cathodes achieve considerable capacity enhancement and excellent rate capability, combining the durable cycling life at 1 C for 500 cycles, in which the overall capacity fading remains as low as 0.083% per cycle. Upper-plateau (Q(H)) and lower-plateau (Q(L)) capacities, static adsorption of polysulfides, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses unveil the underlying nature of the chemical interactions between polysulfide species and the sulfur host. The present results will favor the design and screening of prospective host materials to boost future Li-S batteries.	[Zhou, Lei; Zhang, Yue; Danilov, Dmitri L.; Notten, Peter H.

The surface coating graphite oxide sheets are reduced by a one-step in situ sulfur reduction method under vacuum at 600 degrees C without any additional reductant. The high reduction degree of in situ sulfur reduced graphite oxide (RGO) coating layer will facilitate the rapid charge transfer at high current rate. The flexible encapsulated RGO structure will retard the diffusion of polysulfides and adjust the volume change of sulfur in cycling. As a result, the electrochemical evaluation of the RGO-activated graphene (AG)/S electrode demonstrates superior capacity, cycling and rate performance. The RGO-AG/S electrode with 60 wt% sulfur loading achieves a stable cyclability over 2000 galvanostatic charge/discharge process (capacity-fade rate of only 0.03% per cycle at 1600 mA.g(-1)). The average Coulombic efficiency remains at similar to 96% with no electrolyte additives (such as LiNO3). The outstanding property of RGO-AG/S electrode is attributed to the distinctive in situ sulfur RGO-coated hierarchical texture.

Various materials as the host of sulfur have been applied to improve the performance of lithium sulfur batteries. However, the poor conductivity of sulfur and polysulfides shuttle effect result in poor cycling performance and lower specific capacity. Here, a novel chemical and physical entrapment strategy to improve the electrochemical performance is introduced by designing and synthesizing a 3D network composite which consists of intertwined TiO2-B nanotubes and carbon nanotubes as the sulfur hosts. In this unique structure, carbon nanotubes serve as the long-range conductive network which facilitates the transfer of electrons during redox reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal that TiO2-B provides a strong chemical binding for polysulfides, and each TiO2-B nanotube as an independent reaction chamber provides an efficient barrier to restrict the shuttling of the polysulfides. Specifically, the electrodes exhibit an ultralow capacity fading of 0.05% per cycle over 800 discharge/charge cycles, and a high specific capacity of 580 inAh g(-1) at 1C rate after 300 cycles even with high areal sulfur loading of 3.2 mg cm(-2).

However, the insulating nature of active materials, inevitable shuttle effect caused by dissolution of intermediate polysulfides, and severe volume expansion during lithiation prevent their practical application. Herein, we report a novel sulfur host composed of amorphous TiO2 nanofilm interfaces coating on mesoporous carbon by controlling the hydrolytic process of tetrabutyl titanate on the surface of 3D interconnect conductive carbon matrix. The sulfur host shows high surface area, considerable electrolyte wetting capability and strong absorption for lithium polysulfides. Owe to the rational design and outstanding properties, the sulfur cathode with the high active material content of similar to 74% and mass loading of similar to 3.2 mg cm(-2) exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 1455 mAh.g(-1) and maintained 1242 mAh.g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C (1C = 1675 mAh.g(-1)) current density, and also delivers excellent long term cycling performance at 1 C with initial capacity of 720 mAh.g(-1) and capacity remained up to 81% after 1000 cycles.

However, some critical issues emerge when attempts are made to raise the areal sulfur loading and increase the operation current density to meet the standards for various industrial applications. In this work, polyethylenimine-functionalized carbon dots (PEI-CDots) are designed and prepared for enhancing performance of the Li-S batteries with high sulfur loadings and operation under high current density situations. Strong chemical binding effects towards polysulfides and fast ion transport property are achieved in the PEI-CDots-modified cathodes. At a high current density of 8 mA cm(-2), the PEI-CDots-modified Li-S battery delivers a reversible areal capacity of 3.3 mAh cm(-2) with only 0.07% capacity decay per cycle over 400 cycles at 6.6 mg sulfur loading. Detailed analysis, involving electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations, is done for the elucidation of the underlying enhancement mechanism by the PEI-CDots. The strongly localized sulfur species and the promoted Li+ ion conductivity at the cathode-electrolyte interface are revealed to enable high-performance Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading and large operational current.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery systems offer a theoretical energy density an order of magnitude larger than the popular Li-ion batteries. The principle of working, inherent challenges in utilizing this system for commercial applications, and the various approaches taken to address these challenges are herein discussed in detail. The polysulfide shuttle effect is a major concern that deteriorates electrochemical performance in this system. In the recent past, electrodes have been intricately engineered to tackle this problem. However, more recently, the focus has shifted to the critical role of the separator. Modifying conventional separators or fabricating novel structures to enhance the cell performance appears to be a more feasible option. Some design principles that are critical to the functioning of a separator in Li-S batteries, namely physisorption, chemisorption, and electrostatic repulsion, are discussed. Many recent papers proposed novel cell configurations with specifically designed functional separators. These reports are classified according to three design principles, analyzed critically, and compared with a view to assess their relative merits and efficacy. Some thoughts on the future directions in the development of an efficient separator are described.

In this paper, hollow SiO2 nanotubes (SNTs) were prepared to combine with the aramid fiber paper (AP) as a multifunctional interlayer (SNTs-AP) in the Lithium-sulfur battery. SNTs-AP interlayer could efficiently suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect through polarization sites of SiO2 and enhance the electrical conductivity of lithium-sulfur batteries by forming conductive network. Moreover, the SNTs could accelerate the conversion process of long-chain polysulfides to short-chain polysulfides. The lithium-sulfur batteries with SNTs-AP interlayer exhibits a stable cycling performance with initial specific capacity of 1018mAh/g and average coulombic efficiency of 97.5% at 0.2C. Furthermore, the battery with the SNTs-AP interlayer exhibits a low cyclic decay rate of 0.073% after 350 cycles at 1 C. The above results proves that the SNTs-AP interlayer could provide a strategy for preparing high-stability lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries is still hampered by many problems, especially poor conductivity of sulfur and the polysulfide shuttle. To resolve these problems, we have designed a sulfur host with a hierarchical structure. This host is made by growing MnO2 nanosheets on one side of carbon paper, of which the other side is coated with carbon nanotubes modified with g-C3N4. The fabricated sulfur host provides a physical shield and chemical adsorption against polysulfide shuttling. Moreover, the conductive framework of carbon nanotubes can allow efficient impregnation of sulfur and facilitate electron transport. Benefiting from these synergetic effects, the as-made sulfur cathode with 70.3wt.% sulfur content delivers enhanced electrochemical performances including a high capacity, an excellent rate performance and a superior cycling stability.

However, the weight and stability of the modified layer also affect the cycling properties and the energy density of Li-S cells. Here, we initially construct an ultrathin and lightweight MnO2 layer (380 nm, 0.014 mg cm(-2)) on a commercial polyethylene (PE) separator (MnO2@PE) through a chemical self-assembly method. This MnO2 layer is tightly anchored onto the PE substrate because of the presence of oxygen-containing groups that form a relatively strong chemical force between the MnO2 nanoparticles and the PE substrate. In addition, the mechanical strength of the separator is not affected by this modification procedure. Moreover, because of the catalytic effect and compactness of the MnO2 layer, the MnO2@PE separator can greatly suppress LiPS shuttling. As a result, the application of this MnO2@PE separator in Li-S batteries leads to high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. This strategy provides a novel approach to separator surface modification.

Herein, nitrogen-doped hollow carbon polyhedrons with a thin CNTs conductive surface layer (CNTs/HNC) were prepared by directly pyrolyzing the CNTs coated ZIF-8 polyhedrons crystallite precursors, and subsequently served as sulfur hosts in Li-S batteries. The resulted product CNTs/HNC-800 comprises a nitrogen content of 4.94 at.% as well as a high electrical conductivity of 8.43x10(-1) S cm(-1), which help to effectively adsorb/confine lithium polysulfides and substantially improve the rate capacity of Li-S batteries. With a sulfur loading of 1.60 mg cm(-2), the S@CNTs/HNC based cathode shows a discharge capacity of 870.7 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C, and can maintain 76.4 % of its initial capacity after 500 charge-discharge cycles, corresponding to a capacity fade rate of only 0.047 % per cycle. While with a higher sulfur loading of 2.46 mg cm(-2), a discharge capacity of 649.7 mAh g(-1) can be achieved at 0.5 C, along with a capacity fade rate of merely 0.044 % per cycle during 200 cycles. When sulfur loading is further increased to 5.39 mg cm(-2), it can also maintain a considerable initial discharge capacity of 812 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. This work enriches the ways to prepare complicate nano structured sulfur hosts for long-life and high-rate Li-S batteries.

J	Liu, YS; Zhao, XH; Li, SS; Zhang, Q; Wang, KX; Chen, JS				Liu Yusi; Zhao Xinghe; Li Sesi; Zhang Qiang; Wang Kaixue; Chen Jiesheng			Towards High-performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: the Modification of Polypropylene Separator by 3D Porous Carbon Structure Embedded with Fe3C/Fe Nanoparticles	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN CHINESE UNIVERSITIES			English	Article						Fe; Fe3C nanoparticle; Modified separator; Electrocatalytic effect; Shuttle effect; Lithium-sulfur battery	HETEROSTRUCTURES; POLYSULFIDES; STABILITY	Lithium-sulfur(Li-S) batteries with high energy densities have received increasing attention. However, the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries is still far from the satisfactory of the practical application, which can be mainly attributed to the shuttling of polysulfides and the slow reaction kinetics of polysulfide conversion. To address this issue, a 3D porous carbon structure constructed by 2D N-doped graphene and 1D carbon nanotubes with embedded Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles(NG@Fe3C/Fe) was designed and prepared by a simple programmed calcination method for the modification of polypropylene(PP) separator. The Fe3C/Fe nanoparticles demonstrate an excellent catalytic conversion and strong chemisorption towards polysulfides, while the unique architecture of N-doped graphene promotes the Li+/electron transfer and the physical adsorption of polysulfides. The electrochemical performance of the Li-S batteries with the NG@Fe3C/Fe-modified separator is significantly improved. A large discharge capacity of 1481 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) is achieved at 0.2 C, and a high capacity of 601 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) is maintained after discharged/charged for 500 cycles at a current rate of 1 C. This work provides a new approach for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries through the modification of the PP separator by rationally designed composites with large adsorption capability to polysulfides, good wettability to the electrolyte and high catalytic property.

Herein, an optimum carbon fiber interlayer integrated with bio-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) was designed for enabling trapping-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs. The interlayer was obtained through simple calcination of commercial carbon textile (CT), which can physically block LiPSs and permit the good diffusion of Li ion. The calcined CT containing polar groups derived from sizing agent can not only chemically bond LiPSs, but also promote electron transport and provide more redox reaction sites to reactivate the immobilized LiPSs, owing to high conductivity of the exposed carbon fibers. Moreover, a perfect combination was achieved that the biodegradable nanofiber membrane for preparing GPEs with high ionic conductivity was directly electrospun on the optimal CT (OCT-GPE). The GPE can further suppress the LiPSs shuttle and the abundant amide groups of soy protein isolate in GPE can effectively anchor LiPSs. Consequently, the Li-S batteries involving OCT-GPE showed a great improvement in the cycling stability and rate performance compared with those of the cells based on commercial Celgard 2400. This work will be quite illuminating to design novel interlayer and polymer electrolyte for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, neither NPC nor MWCNT itself can effectively confine the soluble polysufides if cathode thickness e.g. sulfur loading is increased. In this work, NPC was combined with MWCNTs to construct an integrated host structure to immobilize sulfur at a relevant scale. The function of doped nitrogen atoms was revisited and found to effectively attract sulfur radicals generated during the electrochemical process. The addition of MWCNT facilitated the uniform coating of sulfur nanocomposites to a practically thickness and homogenized the distribution of sulfur particles in the pristine electrodes, while NPC provided sufficient pore volume to trap the dissolved polysulfides species. More importantly, the difficulty of electrode wetting, a critical challenge for thick sulfur cathodes, is also mitigated after the adoption of MWCNT, leading to a high areal capacity of ca. 2.5 mA h/cm(2) with a capacity retention of 81.6% over 100 cycles.

However, the shuttle issue and sluggish conversion kinetics of polysulfides remain unsolved. Confining metal nanoclusters with strong polarity in conductive porous carbon is an effective strategy for tackling such knotty issues. Herein, we design and synthesize hollow cubic carbon embedded with highly dispersed cobalt nanoclusters as an effective sulfur reservoir for lithium sulfur batteries. The large cavity structure and well-dispersed cobalt nanoclusters, with uniform sizes near 11 nm, enable the hosting structure to hold the high sulfur loading, 70% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 2 C with a high sulfur loading of 6.5 mg.cm(-2), effective stress release, accelerated polysulfide conversion, superior rate performance, strong physical confinement and chemical absorption capability. Further density functional theoretical calculations demonstrate that the well-dispersed cobalt nanoclusters in the hosting structure play a critical electrocatalytic role in boosting the capability of absorbing and converting polysulfides.

Herein, presented is a multifunctional catalyst with the merits of strong polysulfides adsorption ability, superior polysulfides conversion activity, high specific surface area, and electron conductivity by in situ crafting of the TiO2-MXene (Ti3C2Tx) heterostructures. The uniformly distributed TiO2 on MXene sheets act as capturing centers to immobilize polysulfides, the hetero-interface ensures rapid diffusion of anchored polysulfides from TiO2 to MXene, and the oxygen-terminated MXene surface is endowed with high catalytic activity toward polysulfide conversion. The improved lithium-sulfur batteries deliver 800 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and an ultralow capacity decay of 0.028% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2 C. Even with a high sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2), the capacity retention of 93% after 200 cycles is still maintained. This work sheds new insights into the design of high-performance catalysts with manipulated chemical components and tailored surface chemistry to regulate polysulfides in Li-S batteries.

We present here the use of lightweight boron-and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (B-rGO, N-rGO) coated separators to suppress polysulfide diffusion and enhance active material utilization at high sulfur contents. B-rGO and N-rGO are synthesized through a facile modified Hummer's method involving the exfoliation of graphite sheets. Upon reduction, the carbon forms valuable interlayers with dynamic spacings for polysulfide trapping. Freeze-drying is utilized to preserve the structure of the pillow-like carbon, which is then slurry-coated onto a separator and placed against.a sulfur cathode. The advantages of boron and nitrogen and their affinity towards polysulfides is compared while noting the lighter carbon coatings with good electrochemical stability. The cells attain a loading of 4.0 mg cm(-2) with a high sulfur content of 66.5 +/- 0.5 wt % on including the weight of the coatings. After a long cycle life of 400 cycles, N-rGO and B-rGO are still able to maintain a specific capacity of, respectively, 430 mA h g(-1) and 367 mA hg(-1) (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, for the first time, Fe0.24Co0.26Ni0.10Cu0.15Mn0.25 high-entropy alloy is introduced as the core catalytic host to activate the electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. It is manifested that Fe0.24Co0.26Ni0.10Cu0.15Mn0.25 high-entropy alloy nanocrystallites distributed on nitrogen-doped carbon exhibit high electrocatalytic activity toward the conversion of solid sulfur to solid discharged products across soluble intermediate lithium polysulfides. In particular, benefiting from the accelerated kinetics by high-entropy alloy nanocrystallites and synergistic adsorption by nitrogen-doped carbon, the cathode exhibits high reversible capacity of 1079.5 mAh g(-cathode)(-1) (high utilization of 89.4%) with the whole cathode as active material, instead of sulfur element. Moreover, under both lean electrolyte (3 mu L mg(-1)) and ultrahigh sulfur loading (27.0 mg cm(-2)) condition, the high discharge capacity of 868.2 mAh g(-cathode)(-1) can be still achieved for the sulfur cathode. This strategy opens up a new path to explore catalytic host materials for enhancing the utilization of sulfur in the whole cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries.

In order to pursue the high sulfiphility to obtain good performance, vast environmentally hazardous heavy metals were introduced, increasing the production costs and hindering Li-S battery real application to a certain extent. Along with performance, cost and environmental safety are keys but neglected point, for scalable fabrication of Li-S batteries host material. Here, an economical, efficient yet green adsorbent N-doped carbon-coated iron sulfide (abbreviated as FeS/N-C) has been synthesized via a simple pyrolysis approach. The achieved FeS/N-C exhibits rich element doping of nitrogen and uniform nanosheet morphology, self assembling into stable nanoflower structures. As a sulfur host, the FeS/N-C not only avoids the introduction of the precarious heavy metals, reduces costs but also presents high sulfiphility to achieve extraordinary electrochemical performance. With a sulfur content of 70.8 wt%, the FeS/N-C based sulfur electrodes deliver a high reversible capacity of about 729 mA h/g at 0.5 C after 500 cycles, with the degradation of 0.013% per cycle. Even at a higher rate of 2.0 C, a reversible capacity of 438 mA h/g still remains after 1000cycles. This green and highly efficient host material provides cost-effective solution to large-scale commercial applications of Li-S battery.

Uniform distribution of sulfur and cobalt sulfide at the nanoscale was achieved in the composites. The sulfur-cobalt sulfide nanocomposites delivered higher specific capacities and significantly enhanced rate performance compared to bulk sulfur cathode. The significant performance improvement is in great part due to the formation of sulfur nanoparticles and greatly improved electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites, which would result in shortened mass diffusion pathway and enhanced charge-transfer ability, thereby inducing accelerated electrode reaction kinetics.

Herein, a poly(N-methylaniline) (PMAn) coating film is formed in situ on the cathode surface by electrochemically polymerizing the monomer of N-methylaniline(MAn) contained in the electrolyte during film formation process. The PMAn coating film on the surface of the cathode can prevent the dissolution of polysulfide, then reduce the loss of active material, and slow the oxidation of polysulfide by lithium nitrate, resulting in improved cycle stability. As a result, the lithium-sulfur battery with 0.5 wt% MAn render an initial discharge specific capacity of 1224 mAh/g and a capacity retention of 63.79% for 200 cycles, which is better than the performance of the battery without MAn.

This work reports the preparation and application of a novel nitrogen-doped nanostructured microporous carbon materials (NMC) from sustainable bacterial cellulose (BC) subjecting to activation with KOH. The new material has a considerable specific surface area (1479 m(2)g(-1)) and high pore volume (1.14g cm(-3)), therefore it exhibits excellent electrical conductivity.

In this work, the carbon cloth covered with CoS2 nanoparticles (CC-CoS2) is prepared to function as both three-dimensional (3D) current collector and physicochemical barrier to retard migration of soluble lithium polysulfides. On the one hand, the CC-CoS2 film works as a robust 3D current collector and host with high conductivity, high sulfur loading, and high capability of capturing polysulfides. On the other hand, the 3D porous CC-CoS2 film serves as a multifunctional interlayer that exhibits efficient physical blocking, strong chemisorption, and fast catalytic redox reaction kinetics toward soluble polysulfides. Consequently, the Al@S/AB@CC-CoS2 cell with a sulfur loading of 1.2 mg cm(-2) exhibits a high rate capability (approximate to 823 mAh g(-1) at 4 C) and delivers excellent capacity retention (a decay of approximate to 0.021% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 4 C). Moreover, the sandwiched cathode of CC-CoS2@S/AB@CC-CoS2 is designed for high sulfur loading LSBs. The CC-CoS2@S/AB@CC-CoS2 cells with sulfur loadings of 4.2 and 6.1 mg cm(-2) deliver high reversible capacities of 1106 and 885 mAh g(-1), respectively, after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. The outstanding electrochemical performance is attributed to the sandwiched structure with active catalytic component.

Nevertheless, their applications are restricted by some challenging technical barriers, such as weak cycling stability and low poor-conductivity sulfur loading originated in notorious shuttling effect of polysulfide intermediates. Herein, free of any complicated compositing process, we design an interlayer of carbon fiber paper supported TiO2/TiO to impede the shuttle effect and enhance the electrical conductivity via physical isolation and chemical adsorption. Such a self-crystallized homogeneous interlayer, where TiO2/TiO enables absorbing lithium polysulfides(LiPSs) and TiO plays a key role of high-electron-conductivity exhibited ultrahigh capacities(1000 mA center dot h/g at 0.5 C and 900 mA center dot h/g at 1 C) and outstanding capacity retention rate(97%) after 100 cycles. Thus, our design provides a simple route to suppress the shuttle effect via self-derived evolution Li-S batteries.

In this work, ATTP and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) co-integrated polyacrylonitrile (PAN) hierarchical porous membrane (ATTP/ CNTs@PAN) has been fabricated and investigated as a multifunctional interlayer for lithium-sulfur batteries. Due to a synergistic effect of ATTP and the carboxylated MWCNTs, the porous interlayer is able to effectively suppress the shuttle effect by trapping and confining the dissolved polysulfides. Meanwhile, the addition of MWCNTs improves the conductivity of the composite membrane, which is beneficial for the reutilization of the active species. Therefore, the cells with the interlayer demonstrates superior electrochemical performance, delivering a high initial discharge capacity of 1283 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, and retaining 785 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99%. Meaningfully, this porous composite membrane is low-cost and very effective for high performance Li-S batteries.

Here, it is shown that new electrolytes for Li-S batteries promote the simultaneous formation of bilateral solid electrolyte interfaces on the sulfur-host cathode and lithium anode, thus effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and dendrite growth. These high-capacity Li-S batteries with new electrolytes exhibit a long-term cycling stability, ultrafast-charge/slow-discharge rates, super-low self-discharge performance, and a capacity retention of 94.9% even after a 130 d long storage. Importantly, the long cycle stability of these industrial grade high-capacity Li-S pouch cells with new electrolytes will provide the basis for creating robust energy dense Li-S batteries with an extensive life cycle.

Herein, a 3D flexible multifunctional hybrid is rationally constructed consisting of nitrogen-doped carbon foam@CNTs decorated with ultrafine MgO nanoparticles for the use as advanced current collector. The dense carbon nanotubes uniformly wrapped on the carbon foam skeletons enhance the flexibility and build an interconnected conductive network for rapid ionic/electronic transport. In particular, a synergistic action of MgO nanoparticles and in situ N-doping significantly suppresses the shuttling effect via enhanced chemisorption of lithium polysulfides. Owing to these merits, the as-built electrode with an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 14.4 mg cm(-2) manifests a high initial areal capacity of 10.4 mAh cm(-2), still retains 8.8 mAh cm(-2) (612 mAh g(-1) in gravimetriccapacity) over 50 cycles. The best cycling performance is achieved upon 800 cycles with an extremely low decay rate of 0.06% at 2 C. Furthermore, a flexible soft-packaged Li-S battery is readily assembled, which highlights stable electrochemical characteristics under bending and even folding. This cathode structural design may open up a potential avenue for practical application of high-sulfur-loading Li-S batteries toward flexible energy-storage devices.

Here, zinc???nitrogen codoped carbon (ZnNC) nanofibers with pea-shaped voids were fabricated as an interlayer of Li???S batteries. It was found that the ZnNC nanofibers can anchor LiPSs and catalyze their redox conversion effectively. The cross-linked ZnNC nanofiber interlayer acting as an upper current collector can enhance the electron transfer and accelerate the lithium ion diffusion. The combined effects of the addition of the ZnNC nanofiber interlayer endow the Li???S batteries with high capacity, high -rate performance, and long cycle stability. The initial capacity is 1198.5 mAh g???1 at 0.5 C for the cell with a sulfur loading of about 1.0 mg cm???2. After 500 cycles at 1 C, a capacity of 694.1 mAh g???1 is retained with a low capacity fading of 0.073% per cycle. When the sulfur loading is 6.19 mg cm???2, the capacity reaches 754.8 mAh g???1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.

In an effort to turn waste into wealth, herein, we explore hierarchically porous carbon@graphene composites derived from cigarette filters as efficient cathode hosts for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The hierarchical porous structure enables high sulfur loading and confines the dissolution of lithium polysulfides while the strongly coupled graphene provides an electrically conductive network for electrons to transfer within the composites. Accordingly, the cigarette filter-derived porous carbon@graphene-based cathode containing 78 wt% sulfur could achieve a high capacity of 1010mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 200 cycles and even 722 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C over 1000 cycles with only similar to 0.04% capacity loss per cycle. The findings may open a new trash-to-treasure avenue for the development of high-performance electrode materials in energy storage devices.

Herein, high-energy-density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are developed for applications in next-generation flexible electronics and electric vehicles with long cruising distances. Freestanding high-S-loading carbon nanotubes cathodes are assembled with a phosphorus (P)-doped carbon interlayer coated on commercial separators. Strategies for the active materials and structural design of both the electrodes and separators are highly efficient for immobilizing the lithium polysulfides via multimodal capturing effects; they significantly improve the electrochemical performance in terms of the redox kinetics and cycling stability. The foldable Li-S cells show stable specific capacities of 850 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles, achieving high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 387 Wh kg(cell)(-1) and 395 Wh L-cell(-1), respectively. The Li-S cells show highly durable mechanical flexibilities under severe deformation conditions without short circuit or failure. Finally, the Li-S battery is explored as a light-weight and flexible energy storage device aboard airplane drones to ensure at least fivefold longer flight times than traditional Li-ion batteries. Nanocarbon-based S cathodes and P-doped carbon interlayers offer a promising solution for commercializing rechargeable Li-S batteries.

Li-Ion-Permeable and Electronically Conductive Membrane Comprising Garnet-Type Li6La3Ta1.5Y0.5O12 and Graphene Toward Ultrastable and High-Rate Lithium Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						graphene; garnet solid-state electrolyte; high ionic conductivity; lithium sulfur batteries; Li6La3Ta1.5Y0.5O12	ANODE MATERIALS; DOPED GRAPHENE; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; INTERLAYER; SEPARATOR; COMPOSITE; POLYSULFIDES; ULTRAFAST	State-of-the-art lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries suffer from serious systemic issues, which are mainly derived from polysulfide shuttling effect, poor sulfur utilization, and low Coulombic efficiency. These fundamental challenges impede the practical use of sulfur cathode in commercial battery, albeit its higher theoretical storage capacity compared to intercalation electrodes based Li ion batteries, including graphite-LiCoO2, graphite-LiFePO4, and graphite-Li(Ni,Mn,Co)O-2 cells. In this Article, we designed a multifunctional membrane, comprising a graphene nanosheet and Li-stuffed garnet solid-state electrolyte (SSE) composite, to synergistically enhance both cycle stability and rate capability of general sulfur cathode in a facile and effective way. With the synergistic contribution of graphene nanosheet and SSE, the sulfur cathode exhibited a superior capacity of 1165 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and retained an excellent discharge capacity of 947.03 mAh g(-1) (81% of initial capacity) over 200 cycles when a Gr/SSE-separator was employed. In addition, the sulfur cathode with a Gr/SSE-separator delivered a remarkable discharge capacity of 643 mAh gr(-1) even at 4 C. These results are attributed to three main benefits of Gr/SSE layer: (a) synergistically enhanced electrical and Li-ion conductivity of interlayer, (b) improved electrolyte wettability, and (c) well-entangled architecture of graphene nanosheet and SSE powder.

However, the low utilization of sulfur, the detrimental shuttling behavior of polysulfides, and the sluggish kinetics in electrochemical processes, severely impede their application. Herein, 3D hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets/molybdenum phosphide nanocrystal hollow nanospheres (MoP@C/N HCSs) are introduced to Li-S batteries via decorating commercial separators to inhibit polysulfides diffusion. It acts not only as a polysulfides immobilizer to provide strong physical trapping and chemical anchoring toward polysulfides, but also as an electrocatalyst to accelerate the kinetics of the polysulfides redox reaction, and to lower the Li2S nucleation/dissolution interfacial energy barrier and self-discharge capacity loss in working Li-S batteries, simultaneously. As a result, the Li-S batteries with MoP@C/N HCS-modified separators show superior rate capability (920 mAh g(-1) at 2 C) and stable cycling life with only 0.04% capacity decay per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency.

However, challenges still exist in practical Li-S batteries including low sulfur utilization, and poor cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, we propose a novel hybrid catalyst structure by in situ implanting nanocrystal CoS2 in three-dimensional honeycomb-like hierarchical porous graphitic carbon (HPGC) for high-performance Li-S batteries. A unique synergistic absorption-catalysis-functional effect is demonstrated by comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis: strong physical and chemical co-absorption effects are originated from the large quantity of microporous HPGC and the polar surface of metallic CoS2; the introduced nanocrystal CoS2 with a large specific area can impose an exceptional catalytic effect on the liquid-liquid, solid-liquid, and solid-solid phase redox reactions in Li-S batteries; the reaction dynamics are further guaranteed by the multifunctional properties of the HPGC backbone, including the capabilities in polysulfide sustention, reaction product transportation, electrolyte compensation, and efficiency in assisting diverse electrochemical reaction dynamics. In this way, our results not only develop a novel CoS2@HPGC structure, but also provide fundamental understanding on the catalytic dynamics during each reaction process. Moreover, we further propose the necessity and philosophy of the rational design of catalysts' special structure, which can fulfill the functional dynamics requirements of Li-S batteries, and can be promoted to other Li-S-related cathode design and composite catalytic structure design.

In this work, CoeTiO(2)@C composite was prepared via facile impregnation and carbonization of the mixture of Ti-MOF (MIL-125) and Co(NO3)(2) as an efficient sulfur host for the Li/S batteries. The composite exhibits a tablet-like structure consisting of porous carbon, on which the TiO2 and Co nanoparticles with the diameter of around 8 nm are uniformly dispersed. The porous carbon matrix and TiO2 nanoparticles can effectively trap polysulfides through physical and chemical adsorption, respectively. Furthermore, the catalytic metal Co accelerates the conversion of adsorbed long-chain lithium polysulfides into short-chain sulfides, resulting in the improvements of reaction kinetics and sulfur utilization. The Co-TiO2@C/sulfur composite shows outstanding electrochemical performance duo to the above synergistic effect. The cell with the composite cathode delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1245 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of 0.2C. After 200 cycles, a reversible capacity of 698 mAh g(-1) was maintained. The results indicate its great potential for high performance Li/S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, Li2S suffers from poor cycling stability and rate capability resulted from the serious shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and its low electronic and ionic conductivity. Here, we present a facile ball milling combined with carbon coating method to synthesize porous carbon-coated Li2S (Li2S@C) composites with a high Li2S content by using polystyrene (PS) as a carbon precursor. The Li2S@C composites show a high reversible specific capacity of 676 mAh g(-1) (equal to 971 mAh g(-1) sulfur) after 3 cycles at the current density of 0.1 A g(-1), superior cycling stability with an average decay rate of 0.18% per cycle over 200 cycles, and improved rate capability of 416 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 1.0 A g(-1). The enhanced electrochemical properties of Li2S can be attributed to the porosity and core-shell structure of the Li2S@C composites, which increased the electronic and ionic conductivity of Li2S and alleviated the shuttle effect of intermediate lithium polysulfides in the discharge/charge process.

However, conventional carbonaceous materials generally suffer from poor adsorption of polysulfides due to their intrinsic nonpolar surface. Herein, porous carbon nanosheets modified with metallic cobalt and nonmetallic nitrogen/boron heteroatoms, denoted as Co-NBC, is reported as sulfur immobilizer. The presence of conductive metallic cobalt as well as the doped N/B heteroatoms can enhance the electronic conductivity of carbon matrix, and significantly improve the chemical entrapment of soluble poly sulfides. Kinetics measurements show that metallic Co catalysts can greatly promote the polysulfide redox kinetics of both liquid-liquid and liquid-solid conversion. As a result, the S/Co-NBC composite realizes remarkable rate performance with high specific capacity of 509 mAh g(-1) at a high C-rate of 5 C, and excellent cycle stability with a low capacity fading rate of similar to 0.09% per cycle within 500 cycles. Moreover, the S/Co-NBC cathodes realize promising cycle performance even at harsh working condition of high sulfur loading (similar to 4.6 mg cm(-2)) or low electrolyte addition (similar to 3 mL mg(-1)). This work proposes a meaningful strategy to obtain efficient carbon nanomaterials for high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A novel cost-effective electrode that can hinder the polysulfide shuttling and realize high active material utilization is highly required. Here, we demonstrate a flexible, electrically conductive, nanostructured, and asymmetric hybrid cathode by integrating a high-aspect-ratio wood nano-cellulose and a low-cost commercial carbon nanotube (similar to$ 0.2 g(-1)) into an entangled aerogel film. The vacuum filtration combined with lyophilization enables the aerogel film with quite different nanofiber/nanotube packing densities and pore structures at its two sides. The cooperative effects of the entangled building blocks and the asymmetric porous structure of the aerogel film stimulate the simultaneous increase of active sulfur loading, enhancing the electrolyte penetration, alleviating dissolution and shuttling of polysulfide ions, and promoting the fast electron transportation. The as-generated cathode exhibited a capacity fading of 0.01% per cycle over 1000 discharge/charge cycles at a 0.5 C rate (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)). The average Coulombic efficiency reached similar to 99.7%.

However, the notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides severely hampers the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, we have successfully developed N-doped-carbon-layer-enveloped CoFe alloy (CoFeCN@C) nanoparticles, which are employed to functionize the commercial poly-propylene separators for Li-S batteries. In the hybrid structure, the N-doped carbon layer provides abundant conducting pathways for ion/electron transport, while CoFe alloy offers sufficient polysulfide adsorptive and catalytic sites, which can simultaneously accelerate the multiphase conversion of sulfur/polysulfide/sulfide and suppress the polysulfide shuttling. As a consequence, the Li-S batteries assembled with CoFeCN@C modified separators demonstrate a high sulfur utilization (high initial discharge capacity of 1264 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C), high rate performance (720.1 mAh g(-1) at 4C), and superior cycling stability (a low capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1C). More encouragingly, even with a high sulfur loading up to 8.5 mg cm(-2), a high initial areal capacity of 7.9 mAh cm(-2) is achieved, with a capacity retention of 6.2 mAh cm(-2) after 150 cycles, demonstrating the great potential of CoFeCN@C for high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

Toward High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: Upcycling of LDPE Plastic into Sulfonated Carbon Scaffold via Microwave-Promoted Sulfonation	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						LDPE plastic; sulfonation; microwave; lithium-sulfur battery; Li-/Na-ion battery	LOW-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; SULFUR/CARBON CATHODE; INTERLAYER; ANODES; NANOFIBERS; INSIGHT; HOSTS; FILMS; PAPER; LIFE	Lithium-sulfur batteries were intensively explored during the last few decades as next-generation batteries owing to their high energy density (2600 Wh kg(-1)) and effective cost benefit. However, systemic challenges, mainly associated with polysulfide shuttling effect and low Coulombic efficiency, plague the practical utilization of sulfur cathode electrodes in the battery market. To address the aforementioned issues, many approaches have been investigated by tailoring the surface characteristics and porosities of carbon scaffold. In this study, we first present an effective strategy of preparing porous sulfonated carbon (PSC) from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic via microwave-promoted sulfonation. Microwave process not only boosts the sulfonation reaction of LDPE but also induces huge amounts of pores within the sulfonated LDPE plastic. When a PSC layer was utilized as an interlayer in lithium-sulfur batteries, the sulfur cathode delivered an improved capacity of 776 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and an excellent cycle retention of 79% over 200 cycles. These are mainly attributed to two materialistic benefits of PSC: (a) porous structure with high surface area and (b) negatively charged conductive scaffold. These two characteristics not only facilitate the improved electrochemical kinetics but also effectively block the diffusion of polysulfides via Coulomb interaction.

Herein, a novel structure composed of Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded in a N-doped carbon nanotube hollow polyhedron (Co9S8@NCNHP) is designed to address these issues. Co(9)S8 nanoparticles can efficiently accelerate the kinetics of redox reaction and anchor the polysulfides, enhancing the electrochemical performance of cathodes. Furthermore, NCNHP can accommodate the huge volume expansion and block the diffusion of lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from this rational design, the Co9S8@ NCNHP/S cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1186 mAh.g(-1) with a decay rate of 0.1% per cycle during 200 cycles at 0.2 C. An initial discharge capacity of 780 mAh.g(-1) as well as a decay rate of 0.15% per cycle after 200 cycles can be obtained at a sulfur loading of 3.2 mg.cm(-2). This strategy based on the combination of rational structure design and electrocatalysis could advance the cathode construction in Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, low sulfur mass loading in the cathode results in low areal capacity and impedes the practical use of Li-S cells. Inspired by wood, a cathode architecture with natural, three-dimensionally (3D) aligned microchannels filled with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were developed as an ideal structure for high sulfur mass loading. Compared with other carbon materials, the 3D porous carbon matrix has several advantages including low tortuosity, high electrical conductivity, and good structural stability, which make it an excellent 3D lightweight current collector. The Li-S battery assembled with the wood-based sulfur electrode can deliver a high areal capacity of 15.2 mAh cm(-2) with a sulfur mass loading of 21.3 mg cm(-2). This work provides a facile but effective strategy to develop 3D porous electrodes for Li-S batteries, which can also be applied to other cathode materials to achieve a high areal capacity with uncompromised rate and cycling performance.

However, the shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides hinders the practical application of today's Li-S batteries. Here, immiscible polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blends were used to prepare porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) as coating layers on a glass fiber (GF) separator to block polysulfide diffusion in Li-S batteries. The resultant PCNF coated GF (PCNF@GF) separators exhibited multifunctional advantages: (1) thermally stable GF separator as the substrate helped avoid destructive effects of Li dendrites grown from the lithium anode; (2) the porous conductive PCNF coating functioned as an upper current collector to increase the electrical conductivity and provided an efficient reservoir for absorbing the migrating polysulfides; and (3) the rough GF surface improved the adhesion of additives on the separator and formed efficient electronic contact with S. An enhanced Li-S battery with PCNF@GF-7:3 separator delivered an initial capacity of 1499 mA h g(-1) and a high reversible capacity of 808 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Additionally, the Li-S cell with PCNF@GF separator also presented outstanding anti-self-discharge capacity even after 24 h resting. Therefore, this study demonstrates that PCNF@GF is an excellent separator candidate for the construction of dynamically and statically stable high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, its practical application is seriously hampered by the so-called shuttle effect of the highly soluble polysulfides. Herein, a novel design of multifunctional sandwich-structured polymer electrolyte (polymer/cellulose nonwoven/nanocarbon) for high-performance Li-S batteries is demonstrated. It is verified that Li-S battery with this sandwich-structured polymer electrolyte delivers excellent cycling stability (only 0.039% capacity decay cycle(-1) on average exceeding 1500 cycles at 0.5 C) and rate capability (with a reversible capacity of 594 mA h g(-1) at 4 C). These electrochemical performances are attributed to the synergistic effect of each layer in this unique sandwich-structured polymer electrolyte including steady lithium stripping/plating, strong polysulfide absorption ability, and increased redox reaction sites. More importantly, even with high sulfur loading of 4.9 mg cm(-2), Li-S battery with this sandwich-structured polymer electrolyte can deliver high initial areal capacity of 5.1 mA h cm(-2). This demonstrated strategy here may open up a new era of designing hierarchical structured polymer electrolytes for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Here, we present a rollable and swellable 3D cable-like carbon material consisting of porous fibrous carbon coated with nitrogen-doped graphene foam as self-standing host for both sulfur cathode and lithium anode. A cathode exhibits high areal energy density (10.2 mWh cm(-2)) and power density (5.1 mW cm(-2)) with 92.2% retention for 200 cycles at 0.5 C, and a full cell delivers 525 mAh g(-1) (1.8 mAh cm(-2)) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C with a fade rate of 0.14% per cycle. We found dense urea molecules can assist graphene foam formation, cellulose fibers activation and high-level nitrogen (7.58 atom% N) doping, and the resulting cable-like carbon can improve electrocatalytic polysulfide redox kinetics and lithium dendrite inhibition.

In this work, the polar cross-linked polystyrene/sulfur (PCP/S) composite with a sulfur content of 58 wt% is firstly synthesized as the cathodes for Li-S batteries, in which these polar cross-linked polystyrene agents effectively adsorb polysulfides with a large specific surface area and various functional groups, resulting in an enhancement of the cycle performance and coulombic efficiency for Li-S batteries.

However, the poor conductivity, the large volume expansion of sulfur, and the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides lead to the rapid capacity decay of sulfur cathodes, which impedes the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structured high-efficiency sulfur host (Co-CNTs@TiO2), which was assembled by hollow TiO2 spheres and vertically rooted carbon nanotubes (CNTs) network framework, was developed by simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The 3D CNTs network promoted long-range conductivity and efficiently exposed the Co active sites. Remarkably, the Co particles acted as adsorptive and catalytic sites, which were effective for chemical fixation and conversion of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the hollow and porous structures of Co-CNTs@TiO2 microspheres were conducive to the buffering of volume change during the cycling process, and could physically encapsulate polysulfides. Consequently, the S/Co-CNTs@TiO2 cathode can deliver a high initial specific capacity of 1134.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, remarkable long-term cycling stability over 500 cycles with a low capacity fading rate of 0.072% per cycle at 1.0C, as well as excellent performance under high sulfur loading up to 5.9 mg cm(-2).

However, shuttling behavior and sluggish reaction kinetics still impede its further development. Herein, we report a novel sulfur host material with 3D nanoporous structure consisting of Co3O4 nanoparticles and spontaneously rooting carbon nanotubes on N-doped carbon fibers (Co3O4-CNT@NCFs) to inhibit shuttling effect and promote catalytic kinetics. Both experimental and theoretical analyses show that the rooting CNT incorporated NCFs hierarchical structure establishes a conductive network favoring both longand shot-range electron transfer. Besides, the highly polar and electrocatalytically Co3O4 nanoparticles offer improved interactions with polysulfides and exhibit enhanced catalysis performance, which mitigates the shuttling effect in sulfur cathode and promotes LiPS conversion kinetics. Benefiting from these unique superiorities, the S/Co3O4-CNT@NCFs cathode can efficiently promote and stabilize the sulfur electrochemistry, thus enabling outstanding alternative for high performance Li-S battery (682.1 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C and capacity fading rate of 0.056% over 700 cycles).

It is taken for granted that these elaborate sulfur nanostructures are well maintained in the ultimate electrode after the traditional mixing and coating method. Herein, we, for the first time, reveal the unexpected sulfur structure deterioration in nanosulfur/graphene composites during the electrode preparation using the traditional method because of the long-term neglected dissolution-recrystallization effect of sulfur in solvents. Consequently, compared with binder-free three-dimensional graphene/sulfur electrodes, the milled graphene/sulfur electrodes exhibit much worse electrochemical performance. On the basis of this, we further propose a facile and universal graphene oxide-assisted assembly method to avoid the dissolution-recrystallization of sulfur, by which binder free three-dimensional ethylenediamine-functionalized graphene/sulfur (3DEFGS) electrodes have been successfully prepared. The 3DEFGS electrodes with a high areal sulfur loading of similar to 6 mg cm(-2) exhibit an ultrahigh initial capacity of 1394 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, an excellent rate performance with a capacity of 796 mA h g(-1) at 4 C, and superior long-term cycling stability (885 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C), which are among the best performances achieved by all reported LSB cathodes with high areal sulfur loadings.

The as-prepared composite was blended with elemental sulfur by heating, then cathode materials (ZnS/MC/S) was obtained. The ZnS/MC composite was characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS and N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The results showed that ZnS particle was uniformly loaded to the surface of MC through ultrasonic dispersion when content of ZnS was less than 17wt%. ZnS nanoparticles aggregated to form sphalerite ZnS by heat treatment or increasing content of ZnS. Cyclic voltammetry test showed that ZnS accelerated the oxidation process of polysulfides. Charge/discharge tests indicated that the initial discharge specific capacity was 1354.6 mAh/g, while the coulombic efficiency of the first charge and discharge was 98.7%. The capacity still remained 650 mAh/g after 50 cycles.

Graphene-wrapped sulfur/metal organic framework-derived microporous carbon composite for lithium sulfur batteries	APL MATERIALS			English	Article							RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; POROUS CARBON; SURFACE-AREA; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; GRAPHITE; OXIDE	A three-dimensional hierarchical sandwich-type graphene sheet-sulfur/carbon (GS-S/ CZIF8-D) composite for use in a cathode for a lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery has been prepared by an ultrasonic method. The microporous carbon host was prepared by a one-step pyrolysis of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 (ZIF-8), a typical zinc-containing metal organic framework (MOF), which offers a tunable porous structure into which electro-active sulfur can be diffused. The thin graphene sheet, wrapped around the sulfur/zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 derived carbon (S/CZIF8-D) composite, has excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility, thus facilitating rapid electron transport and accommodating the changes in volume of the sulfur electrode. Compared with the S/(CZIF8-D) sample, Li-S batteries with the GS-S/(CZIF8-D) composite cathode showed enhanced capacity, improved electrochemical stability, and relatively high columbic efficiency by taking advantage of the synergistic effects of the microporous carbon from ZIF-8 and a highly interconnected graphene network. Our results demonstrate that a porous MOF-derived scaffold with a wrapped graphene conductive network structure is a potentially efficient design for a battery electrode that can meet the challenge arising from low conductivity and volume change.

However, the intrinsic insulativity of sulfur and the polysulfide shuttle effect have been the key problems that hinder the commercialization of lithium sulfur batteries. Here, using a facile shearing implement assists thermal synthesis process, in which liquid metal gallium and sulfur (mass ratio1:10) are the only reactants, we create a 3D porous sulfur/gallium hybrid materials (S/Ga). Micro/nanometer liquid metal gallium particles embed in the porous sulfur. The S/Ga cathode lithium cell exhibits a high Coulombic efficiencies of 98.7%, and high specific capacities of 1044 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 1.0 mA cm(-2), and good cyclic stability. During first cycle discharge process of the S/Ga cathode, the sulfur reduces to Li2S8 and dissolves in the electrolyte, then the liquid metal Ga has an intimate electrical contact with conductive carbon substrates. Electrons are easily transferred to high conductive liquid metal Ga. Due to the electron abundance on Ga surface, it shows an electrocatalytic effect for the conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2S4-8) to Li2S2/Li2S, thus improving S utilization and cyclic stability.

Sulfur-polyaniline coated mesoporous carbon composite in combination with carbon nanotubes interlayer as a superior cathode assembly for high capacity lithium-sulfur cells	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur cell; CNT interlayer; Lithium polysulfides; Polyaniline; Mesoporous carbon	ENHANCED PERFORMANCE; BATTERIES; GRAPHENE; HYBRID; STABILITY; SHUTTLE; ENERGY	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells are gaining upper hand as the next generation energy storage systems with remarkable electrochemical features, suitable for applications in portable electronic devices and hybrid electric vehicles. The present work is focused on analyzing the effects of the polyaniline coated mesoporous carbon used for modifying the sulfur cathode and the flexible interlayer of carbon nanotubes (CNT interlayer), inserted between the cathode and the separator, on the electrochemical performance of the assembled Li-S cells. The composite of sulfur with the polyaniline (PANI) coated mesoporous carbon (SPMC) is used as the modified cathode material. The PANI coated mesoporous carbon (PMC) synthesized by in situ polymerization is subjected to solvothermal treatment with sulfur to obtain the SPMC cathode. The cells assembled using the SPMC composite as cathode with a sulfur content of 80 wt% and CNT film as interlayer exhibit an initial discharge capacity of 1137 mAhg(-1) at 0.2 C rate. Furthermore, at 1 C rate the cells deliver a discharge capacity of 968mAhg(-1) at the initial cycle and 700mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles corresponding to an extremely low capacity decay of 0.14% per cycle. The highly conducting polyaniline coated carbon helps in enhancing the electrical contact of the modified cathode and thus limits the dissolution of the lithium polysulfides and the associated shuttling effect during cycling. The polyaniline encapsulation can also minimize the adverse effects of the volume expansion of sulfur during lithium intake. The porous structured CNT interlayer contributes towards enhancing the overall electrical conductivity of the cathode assembly and localizes the migrating polysulfides within the cathode region, which helps to further hinder the polysulfide shuttling phenomenon. The novelty of the work is in the effective modification of the sulfur cathode using the cost-effective, electrically conducting and eco-friendly polyaniline and mesoporous carbon to achieve the required electrical contact, good control over the volume expansion of sulfur during lithium intake and better utilization of sulfur. The modifications effected on the sulfur cathode by the presence of the polyaniline coated carbon, along with the role of the CNT interlayer in meticulously controlling the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon substantially contribute towards improving the capacity and the cycling stability of the assembled Li-S cells.

J	Su, YS; Manthiram, A				Su, Yu-Sheng; Manthiram, Arumugam			A facile in situ sulfur deposition route to obtain carbon-wrapped sulfur composite cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Lithium batteries; Cathode materials; Sulfur-carbon composites; In situ sulfur deposition	HIGH-CAPACITY	An in situ sulfur deposition route has been developed for synthesizing sulfur-carbon composites as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. This facile synthesis method involves the precipitation of elemental sulfur at the interspaces between carbon nanoparticles in aqueous solution at room temperature. The product has been characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, charge-discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The sulfur-carbon composite cathode with 75 wt.% active material thus obtained exhibits a remarkably high first discharge capacity of 1116 mAh g(-1) with good cycle performance, maintaining 777 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. The significantly improved electrochemical performance of the sulfur-carbon composite cathode is attributed to the carbon-wrapped sulfur network structure, which suppresses the loss of active material during charging/discharging and the migration of the polysulfide ions to the anode (i.e., shuttling effect). The integrity of the cathode structure during cycling is reflected in low impedance values observed after cycling. This facile in situ sulfur deposition route represents a low-cost approach to obtain high-performance sulfur-carbon composite cathodes for rechargeable Li-S batteries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a conductive metal-organic framework (MOF)modified separator has been designed and fabricated through a facile filtration method to address the issues. Specifically, its intrinsic microporous structure, hydrophilic polar property, and conductive feature could make it easy to contact with and trap polysulfides and boost the kinetics of electrochemical reactions. Both the physical and chemical properties of the as prepared separator are beneficial to alleviating the shuttle effect and enhancing the rate capability. Accordingly, the electrochemical performance of the battery with a MOF-modified separator was significantly improved.

The addition of PSSA improves not only the dispersion of the as-received graphene, but also the homogeneity of the constituents in the S cathode slurry; accordingly, better electronic and ionic conductivities are obtained. The electrical impedance of the cell constructed using the S cathode with the as-received graphene is greatly reduced from 142.0 to 14.6 Omega when PSSA is added during the preparation of the cathode. Moreover, the addition of the PSSA-dispersed graphene to the S cathode significantly improves the capacity, cycle life, and coulombic efficiency during the charge-discharge process, since PSSA increases the contact between the dispersed graphene and the insulated S powder.

The as-prepared nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical performance of sulfur/carbon nanocomposites were tested by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling. When applied as the cathode material in lithium sulfur batteries, the as-prepared sulfur/carbon nanocomposites exhibited a high reversible capacity of 1220 mAh g(-1) in the first cycle and maintained a satisfactory cyclability. This drastic improvement of specific capacity and cycling performance could be attributed to the reduced particle size of sulfur and the homogeneous distribution of sulfur nanoparticles on a carbon matrix, resulting from this novel solution-based processing technique.

As cathodes for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the prepared GPF/sulfur nanocomposites exhibited a high capacity up to 962 mA h g(-1) after 120 cycles at 2 A g(-1). A high reversible capacity of 591 mA h g(-1) was still retained even at an extremely large current density of 20 A g(-1). Such impressive electrochemical performance of GPF should benefit from the 2D hierarchical porous architecture with an extremely high specific surface area, which could facilitate the efficient entrapment of sulfur and polysulfides and afford rapid charge transfer, fast electronic conduction as well as intimate contact between active materials and the electrolyte during cycling.

J	Lo, YH; Kuo, PL; Wu, JJ				Lo, Yi-Hsuan; Kuo, Ping-Lin; Wu, Jih-Jen			Direct coating of multifunctional zinc oxide-reduced graphene oxide interlayer on cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Direct coating; Multifunctional interlayer; Zinc oxide; Reduced graphene oxide; Lithium-sulfur battery	COMPOSITE	In this work, a multifunctional interlayer composed of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs)-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite nanosheets was directly coated on the top of sulfur-rGO composite (S-rGO) cathode for the improvement of the electrochemical performances of lithium-sulfur batteries. With this configuration, the rGO network well connecting the interlayer and cathode provides an appropriate electrically conductive pathway for the discharge and charge processes. The soluble lithium polysulfides formed during the discharge process are efficiently absorbed on ZnO NPs to suppress the shuttle effect. In addition, the ZnO NP plays the role of an electrochemical catalyst to accelerate the redox kinetics. With the ZnO-rGO interlayer, the cathode also exhibits the considerably enhanced Li ion transfer/transport properties. The reversible conversion of sulfur to Li2S2/Li2S therefore occurs in the ZnO-rGO interlayer to efficiently reutilize the retained active materials. Moreover, the ZnO-rGO interlayer, which accounts for similar to 8.5 wt% of the whole cathode, can buffer the volume expansion in the cathode to prevent irreversible structural destruction. Accordingly, a capacity degradation of 0.04% per cycle at 1C after 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 838 mAhg(-1) is delivered by S-rGO cathode with the ZnO-rGO interlayer.

Carbon nanotube (CNT) has been used widely for separator modification to overcome the shuttle effect of polysulfides. This strategy based on CNT can improve the performance of Li-S batteries in terms of their cycling stability and rate capability. However, the performance improvement has not been assessed under various mass loadings of CNT, which would significantly affect the entire battery energy density and manufacturing cost. In this study, we prepared CNT-modified polypropylene (CNT-PP) separators and explored the effects of different CNT mass loadings on the performance of Li-S batteries. We also developed an approach to reduce the amount of CNTs required while maintaining high performance. The results showed that the CNT-PP separator significantly improved the electrochemical performance of the pure sulfur cathode compared with the PP separator, and a CNT mass loading of 0.6 mg cm(-2) obtained the optimal battery performance. Moreover, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was added to reduce the CNT mass loading, which promoted the dispersion of the CNT in aqueous solution and also enabled the chemical interaction between the CNT and polysulfides to inhibit the shuttling effect. When CNT/PVP was applied to modify the PP separator, the mass loading could be reduced by about 33% compared with the pure CNT while maintaining the optimal battery performance. At a CNT/PVP mass loading of 0.4 mg cm(-2), the cells had a much higher initial capacity (1226 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 936 mA h g(-1) at 2 C) and cycling stability (617 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 C) than the cells containing pure CNT-modified separators with a CNT mass loading of 0.6 mg cm(-2). These findings could facilitate the development of a facile approach for the practical application of Li-S batteries.

The evolution of the morphology and microstructure of sakura petal-derived carbon materials was investigated in detail. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries assembled from composite cathodes with sakura petal-derived carbon products as the host and pure sulfur as the active material were systematically researched. The results indicated that the morphology of the products changed from a plate-like morphology to plates with ordered grooves and then to a wrinkled sheet-like morphology. In addition, many micropores were formed during the activation process. Moreover, the sample that underwent two-step activation exhibited an improved specific discharging capacity, cycling performance and rate performance. In summary, the sakura-derived carbon host is expected to assist in the future application of Li-S batteries.

Herein, the heterogeneous composite with defective Bi2Se3-x nanosheets and porous nitrogen-doped carbon (Bi2Se3-x/NC) is prepared by selenizing bismuth metal-organic frameworks as a multifunctional sulfur host. The highly efficient immobilization-conversion on LiPSs is realized by the synergistic effect of structure construction strategy and defect engineering. It is found that Bi2Se3-x, with the suitable amount of selenium vacancies achieves the best electrochemical performance due to the advantages of its structure and composition. These results confirm the intrinsic correlation between defects and catalysis, which are revealed by computational and experimental studies. Due to these superiorities, the developed sulfur electrodes exhibited admirable stability and a fairly lower capacity decay rate of approximately 0.0278% per cycle over 1,000 cycles at a 3 C rate. Even at the high sulfur loading of 6.2 mg.cm(-2), the cathode still demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 455 mAh.g(-1) at 1 C. This work may enlighten the development of mechanism investigation and design principles regarding sulfur catalysis toward high-performance Li-S batteries.

In this paper, we construct a three-dimensional hierarchical host formed by one-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes(NCNTs) grown in situ on both sides of two-dimensional oxides nanosheets. The uniformly grown NCNTs not only provide excellent overall conductivity, but also prevent stacking between two-dimensional nanosheets, providing hierarchical pores for diffusion of molten sulfur, which is beneficial to the uniform impregnating of sulfur. Meanwhile, the two-dimensional oxides nanosheets(NS) and cobalt nanoparticles have a strong chemical affinity with polysulfide, promoting the polysulfides adsorption and redox kinetics. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, Li-S batteries based on Co-NCNTs/NS@S cathode delivers a high discharge capability of 1552 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C with a high sulfur content of 80 %, excellent rate capability of 860 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and outstanding cycle life with a low capacity decay rate of 0.04 % per cycle over 550 cycles.

In this work, densely integrated Co,N-codoped graphene@carbon nanotubes porous hybrids (Co,N-G@CNT) are prepared as high-efficiency sulfur hosts for lithium sulfur batteries via reductive pyrolysis of (Co,Zn)-bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks separated graphene oxide sheets. The obtained Co,N-G@CNT possesses 3D interconnected conductive network, large nanopore volume and high accessible surface area as well as enriched doping sites, which endow the carbon matrix multifaceted abilities for sulfur accommodation and electron/ion transfer as well as polysulfides immobilization. Due to the rational structure design of the host material, the Co,N-G@CNT/S composite exhibits high sulfur utilization (1398 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C), excellent rate capability (611 mA h g(-1) at 6 C) as well as remarkable cycling stability (retained 659 mA h g(-1) at 1C after 1500 cycles). This work provides a new perspective to function-directed structure design of sulfur hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries, and also holds great promise for the application in other energy storage/conversion systems such as metal air batteries, supercapacitors, and electrochemical catalysts.

G@MC with active Mn2+ sites can effectively anchor the LiPS by forming the Mn-S chemical bond according to our theoretical calculation results. In addition, the catalytic Mn2+ sites and conductive graphene layer of G@MC could accelerate the reversible conversion of LiPS via the spontaneous "self-redox" reaction and the rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. As a result, the G@MC-based battery exhibits only 0.038 % capacity decay (per cycle) after 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. This work affords new insights for designing the integrated functional interface for stable Li-S batteries.

However, the bidirectional catalysis for discharging and charging processes in Li-S battery is still challenging. Herein, a (110) facet-dominated VO2 is prepared through the thermal-induced partial decomposition of (NH4)(2)V4O9 (NVO), forming a (110)VO2@NVO hybrid with the bidirectional catalysis ability. This (110) facet-dominated VO2 shows the ability to break the S-S bond to guide the Li2S deposition in the reduction process and reduce the delithiation barrier of Li2S to promote the oxidation process. The above hybrid is loaded on carbon nanofiber (CNF) to build an interlayer, where the 3D CNF and the conductive NVO ensure the fast electron transfer. The assembled battery with the above interlayer exhibits a high capacity of 1038 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.1 C (capacity retention: 70%). At a high rate of 5 C, a high capacity of 521 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles is reached. Even under an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 10.3 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 4 mu L mg(s)(-1), stable cycling performance with a high capacity of >3 mAh cm(-2) is also achieved.

However, some serious challenges hinder the commercialization, such as the shuttle effect of polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics. Herein, novel FeP/spongy carbon (SC) composites with multiple adsorptions and catalytic sites are prepared as a modified separator. Specifically, the SC proves the structural stability and long ions/electron transmission channel. The adding of FeP can spontaneously react with polysulfides to block the shuttling and catalyze the conversion of sulfur chemistry. The formed adsorption-diffusion-conversion surface is beneficial to reduce the polarization and accelerate the redox kinetics. Furthermore, the FeP/SC modified separator can bring down the flammability to prove high-safety LSBs. Benefiting from these features, the assembled cells with FeP/SC exhibits extraordinary cycling stability (526 mAh g(-1) over 400 cycles at 1 C), a superior rate property with 619 mAh g(-1) at 2 C. Moreover, the cells with a high areal sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2) can maintain a capacity of 618 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles. Such a FeP/SC modified separator provides a potential commercial application for high-safety and advanced Lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the commercialization application is being hindered by capacity decay, mainly attributed to the polysulfide shuttle and poor conductivity of sulfur. Here, we have designed a novel dual core-shell nanostructure of S@C@MnO2 nanosphere hybrid as the sulfur host. The S@C@MnO2 nanosphere is successfully prepared using mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (MCHS) as the template and then in situ MnO2 growth on the surface of MCHS. In comparison with polar bare sulfur hosts materials, the as prepared robust S@C@MnO2 composite cathode delivers significantly improved electrochemical performances in terms of high specific capacity (1345 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), remarkable rate capability (465 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 C) and excellent cycling stability (capacity decay rate of 0.052% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 3.0 C). Such a structure as cathode in Li-S batteries can not only store sulfur via inner mesoporous carbon layer and outer MnO2 shell, which physically/chemically confine the polysulfides shuttle effect, but also ensure overall good electrical conductivity. Therefore, these synergistic effects are achieved by unique structural characteristics of S@C@MnO2 nanospheres.

Herein, we report a self-standing, hybrid-nanostructured cathode host comprised of metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived porous carbon polyhedrons and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the significant improvement of both the electrode cyclability and energy density. The strong coupling of the intertwined CNTs and strung porous carbon polyhedrons as a binder-free thin film significantly enhances the long-range electronic conductivity and provides abundant active interfaces as well as robust electrode integrity for sulfur electrochemistry. Attributed to the synergistic combination of the CNTs and carbon polyhedrons, the obtained sulfur electrodes exhibit outstanding cyclability, an excellent high-rate response up to 10C, and an ultra-high volumetric capacity of 960 Ah L-1.

Here we report a novel hierarchical porous honeycomb carbon (HPHC) for lithium-sulfur battery cathode with effective trapping of polysulfides. The HPHC was prepared by a simple template process, and a sulfur-carbon composite based on HPHC was synthesized for lithium-sulfur batteries by a melt-diffusion method. It is found that the elemental sulfur was dispersed inside the three-dimensionally hierarchical pores of HPHC based on the analyses. Electrochemical tests reveal that the sulfur-HPHC composite shows high rate capability and long cycling stability as cathode materials. The sulfur-HPHC composite with sulfur content of 66.3 wt% displays an initial discharge capacity of 923 mAh g(-1) and a reversible discharge capacity of 564 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 2 C charge-discharge rate. In particular, the sulfur-HPHC composite presents a long term cycling stability up to 300 cycles at 1.5 C. The results illustrate that the electrochemical reaction constrained inside the interconnected macro/meso/micropores of HPHC would be the dominant factor for the excellent high rate capability and long cycling stability of the sulfur cathode, and the three-dimensionally honeycomb carbon network would be a promising carbon matrix structure for lithium-sulfur battery cathode.

To address these issues, a porous microsphere-based sulfur cathode, consists of Mg2+ etched ZIF-67 and carbon nanotubes encapsulated with graphene oxide (Mg ZIF-67/CNT@GO), was fabricated. The introduction of CNTs endows the composite with good electrical conductivity, and at the same time the loss of polysulfides is mitigated through its unique porous structure. Moreover, the Mg2+ etched ZIF-67 also provides a large area of active interface, which promotes its trapping with polysulfides and catalytic performance towards polysulfides conversion. Accordingly, the sulfur cathode with Mg ZIF-67/CNT@GO composite delivers good electrochemical performance. The battery exhibits a high capacity retention rate of 87.4% and an areal capacity of 3.35 mAh cm(-2) under 3.0 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading at 0.2 C. In addition, the pouch cell cycled at 0.1 C retains its high capacity of 640.8 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. This work provides a promising sulfur cathode design approach for the implementation of LSBs.

However, the shuttling of soluble polysulfides deteriorates the battery performance tremendously. To suppress the diffusion of soluble polysulfides, diatomite that has abundant natural three-dimensional ordered pores is incorporated into the cathode to trap polysulfides. The composite cathode material (S-DM-AB for short), including sulfur (S), diatomite (DM), and acetylene black (AB) is prepared by an impregnation method. For comparison, another composite cathode material (S-AB for short) including sulfur and acetylene black is also prepared by the same method. The battery with S-DMAB composite cathode material delivers a discharge capacity of 531.4 mAh/g after 300 cycles at 2 C with a capacity retention of 51.6% at room temperature. By contrast, the battery with S-AB composite cathode material delivered a capacity of only 196.9 mAh/g with a much lower capacity retention of 18.6% under the same condition. The addition of diatomite in the cathode is proved to be a cheap and effective way to improve the life time of the lithium sulfur batteries.

With a systematic investigation, a novel graphene/cotton-carbon cathode is presented here that enables sulfur loading and content as high as 46 mg cm(-2) and 70 wt% with an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of as low as only 5. The graphene/cotton-carbon cathodes deliver peak capacities of 926 and 765 mA h g(-1), respectively, at C/10 and C/5 rates, which translate into high areal, gravimetric, and volumetric capacities of, respectively, 43 and 35 mA h cm(-2), 648 and 536 mA h g(-1), and 1067 and 881 mA h cm(-3) with a stable cyclability. They also exhibit superior cell-storage capability with 95% capacity-retention, a low self-discharge constant of just 0.0012 per day, and stable poststorage cyclability after storing over a long period of six months. This work demonstrates a viable approach to develop lithium-sulfur batteries with practical energy densities exceeding that of lithium-ion batteries.

Despite its great potentiality, overcoming the significant capacity decay over cycling is the main challenge for its practical applications. Here, we report a facile and cost-effective strategy to construct the Li-S battery with high energy density and long cycle life using the N-doped mesoporous carbon/graphene aerogel (NMC/GA) as the sulfur host (S@NMC/GA). The NMC/GA composite with interconnected mesoporous and microporous structures not only facilitates transportation of electron and ion but also prevents polysulfide shuttling. Therefore, the S@NMC/GA electrode delivers a high reversible discharge capacity of 674 mAhg(-1) at 0.5 C over 300 cycles.

The reported process involves two heating steps at low temperature. The first plateau at 150 degrees C melts elemental sulfur, while the second, at 300 degrees C, produces the cycling of polyacrylonitrile, and incorporates sulfur to the cyclic polymeric structure. A fully morphological and electrochemical characterization was carried out. The SPAN composite contains (38.3 +/- 0.2) % S. Li-S batteries assembled using these cathodes have shown good performance, reaching high and stable capacity values, above 1000 mAh gS-1 after 150 cycles at 0.1 C. This is the first time that stable cycling is achieved for a SPAN composite synthesized at such low temperatures and for short heating treatments. Our work describes an easy route to prepare a promising candidate for cathode material of Li-S batteries by using a low-cost process and low-cost materials.

Herein we explore a simple in-operando lithium-sulfur cell design to enable direct visualization of the formation of the soluble polysulfide species and their temporal and spatial distribution over the entire discharge/charge cycle under an optical microscope. Our results reveal detailed evidence of electrochemical degradation in lithium-sulfur batteries and help us to understand the improvements in electrochemical performances using advanced lithium-sulfur cell designs. As examples, we show that a cathode consisting of hollow sulfur nanoparticles with a conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coating exhibits significantly reduced dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte, and thus superior electrochemical performance could be achieved. Moreover, the trapping of soluble polysulfide species in the cathode side was also confirmed in our designed in-operando lithium-sulfur cell with a Nafion modified separator. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Sufficient sulfur storage space, local fixation of polysulfides, and outstanding electrical conductivity are crucial for a robust cathode host. Herein, a modified template method is proposed to synthesize a highly regular and uniform nitrogen/oxygen dual-doped honeycomb-like carbon as sulfur host (N/O-HC-S). The unique structure not only offers physical entrapment for polysulfides (LiPSs) but also provides chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion sites of polysulfides. In addition, this structure offers enough space for loading sulfur, and a regular space of nanometer size can effectively prevent sulfur particles from accumulating. As expected, the as-prepared N/O-HC900-S with high areal sulfur loading (7.4 mg cm(-2)) shows a high areal specific capacity of 7.35 mAh cm(-2) at 0.2 C. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the strong chemical immobilization and catalytic conversion of LiPSs attributed to the spin density and charge distribution of carbon atoms will be influenced by the neighbor nitrogen/oxygen dopants. This structure that provides cooperative chemical adsorption, high lithium ions flux, and catalytic conversion for LiPSs can offer a new strategy for constructing a polysulfide confinement structure to achieve robust Li-S batteries.

Reduced graphene oxide coated porous carbon-sulfur nanofiber as a flexible paper electrode for lithium-sulfur batteries	NANOSCALE			English	Article							HIGH-RATE CAPABILITY; CATHODE MATERIALS; SOFT APPROACH; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; NITROGEN; LAYER; CONFINEMENT; STABILITY; NANOTUBES	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted great attention owing to their excellent electrochemical properties, such as the high discharge voltage of 2.3 V, specific capacity of 1675 mA h g(-1) and energy density of 2600 Wh kg(-1). The widely used slurry made electrodes of Li-S batteries are plagued by the serious shuttle effect and insulating nature of sulfur. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide coated porous carbon nanofiber flexible paper (rGO@S-PCNP) was fabricated and directly used as an additive-free cathode for Li-S batteries. The results show that the rGO@S-PCNP is certified to be effective at relieving the shuttle effect and improving the conductivity, thus achieving high electrochemical performance. The rGO@S-PCNP composite with a sulfur content of 58.4 wt% delivers a high discharge capacity of 623.7 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) with the average Coulombic efficiency of 97.1%. The excellent cyclability and high Coulombic efficiency indicate that the as-prepared rGO@S-PCNP composite paper can be a promising cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries, and is envisioned to have great potential in high energy density flexible power devices. This facile strategy brings great significance for large-scale industrial fabrication of flexible lithium-sulfur batteries.	[Chu, R. X.; Lin, J.; Wu, C. Q.; Zheng, J.; Chen, Y. L.; Zhang, J.; Han, R.

Herein, nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers with hierarchical pore structure and long-range conductivity were prepared by facile electrospinning method and subsequent pyrolysis in the N-2 atmosphere. Benefiting from high specific surface area, large pore volume, rational nitrogen configuration and interwoven conductive network when directly used as freestanding sulfur composite cathodes, the resultant electrodes have exhibited high areal capacity, large volumetric capacity and good cycling stability even under high sulfur content and high sulfur loading. At sulfur content of 85 wt% and sulfur loading of 14.3 mg cm(-2), the electrode delivers high areal capacity of 10.4 mA h cm(-2) and volumetric capacity of 904 mA h cm(-3) at high current density of 4.8 mA cm(-2). The electrochemical performance ranks it among the state-of-the-art those in the carbon-based sulfur cathodes. This work opens a new avenue for the development of high-energy-density and long-life Li-S batteries based on the freestanding conductive hierarchical porous nanoarchitectures.

Nevertheless, the shuttle effect of polysulfide leads to rapid capacity decay and hinders the practical application of LSBs. Herein, a composite of heterogeneous bimetallic phosphide and graphene oxide (FeP-CoP/GO) is devised as a high efficiency catalyst. FeP-CoP not only promotes the deposition of Li2S to improve the utilization of sulfur, but also offers adequate active sites for anchoring and catalyzing the transformation of polysulfide to restrain the shuttle effect. And GO plays a role of auxiliary enhancement because of its big specific surface area and good conductivity. Therefore, FeP-CoP/GO/S with 79 wt.% sulfur content exhibits a high discharge capacity of 773 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and displays favorable cycle stability of 481 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles with high coulombic efficiency of 96.6%. Bimetal phosphides as the catalyst offer a new perspective for high-specific-energy Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous studies indicated that LiNO3 participated in the formation of a passive layer on the lithium electrode and thus suppressed the redox shuttle of the dissolved polysulfides. However, the effects of the LiNO3 on the positive electrode materials have rarely been investigated. By combining scanning electron microscopy, element-selective X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and electrochemical characterizations, we performed a comprehensive study of how the LiNO3 altered the properties of the sulfur electrode/electrolyte interface in Li-S cells and thus influenced the cell performance. We found that LiNO3 is a double-edged sword in the Li-S cell: on one hand, it increased the consumption of the active sulfur; on the other hand, it promoted the survival of the carbon matrix constituent in the sulfur electrode. These two competitive effects indicated that a proper moderate concentration of LiNO3 is required to achieve an optimized cell performance.

Herein, a free-standing, mechanically flexible, binder-free 3D interconnected carbon nanotube 'foam' (CNTF) is prepared by a single-step facile method and used as a sulfur host in Li-S batteries. For the first time, such a simple method has been adopted for the preparation of free-standing CNT scaffolds for use in Li-S cells, as our method is free from the widely reported solvent-based techniques such as vacuum infiltration of CNTs to obtain free-standing forms but requires further purification and/or drying. A high-areal sulfur loading of 7.1 mgS cm(-2), accounting to a total electrode mass of 10.9 mgelectrode cm(-2), with yet high electrochemical sulfur utilization of 72% is achievable by the foam-like CNT structure. Reversible areal capacities of up to 9 mAh cm(-2) at extremely low electrode weight (800 mAh (-1)(gelectrode)) and specific capacities up to 1378 mAh g(S)(-1) are demonstrated. The interconnected porous network acts as a reservoir for trapping soluble lithium polysulfide compounds and greatly improves the sulfur reutilization. The lightweight CNT scaffold further provides enduring electrical contact with the sulfur species, resulting in excellent cycling stability and a potentially high gravimetric energy density desirable for automobiles and aerospace applications. The CNTF/sulfur composite cathode exhibits better rate performance and cycling stability than most of the recently reported CNT-based cathode materials for Li-S batteries.

In this study, porous tubular graphitic carbon nitride (PTCN) was synthesized as the sulfur host by hydrothermal treatment, thermal shock and etching methods. By etching technology, the hollow nanotube tentacles grow on the tube wall of PTCN, the mesoporous appears on the inner wall, and a large number of nitrogen defects are introduced. The vertically-rooted hollow nanotube tentacles on the PTCN surface facilitate electron conduction for sulfur redox reactions. The hollow and porous architecture exposes plentiful active interfaces for accelerated redox conversion of polysulfide. Furthermore, the nitrogen defects in PTCN enable more excellent intrinsic conductivity, higher adsorbability and conversion catalytic activity to LiPSs. Based on the above synergetic effect, the batteries with PTCN/S cathodes realize a high discharge capacity of 504 mAh g(-1) at 4 C and a stable cycling behavior over 500 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.063% per cycle. The results indicate a promising approach todesigning a high performance electrode material for Li-S batteries.

To deal with this issue, we fabricate a novel sulfur composite with a coaxial three-layered structure, in which sulfur is deposited on carbon fibers and coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS), thus enabling a high sulfur loading of 70.8 wt % without the expense of its electrochemical performance. Benefiting from the rigid conductive framework of carbon fibers and flexible buffering matrix of the polymer for blocking the diffusion loss of discharge intermediates, the as-fabricated composite electrode exhibits a high initial reversible capacity of 1272 mA h g(-1) (based on the total mass of the composite), a stable cyclability with a retained capacity of 807 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles, and a high Coulombic efficiency of similar to 99% upon extended cycling, offering a new selection for practical application in Li-S batteries.

A new direction for the performance improvement of rechargeable lithium/sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium/sulfur battery; Sulfur; Polysulfide; Catholyte; Lithium plating	LI-ION BATTERIES; SULFUR BATTERY; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; GEL ELECTROLYTE; CYCLE PROPERTY; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; DISCHARGE; POLYSULFIDES; CELLS	In this work we introduce a new direction for the performance improvement of rechargeable lithium/sulfur batteries by employing an electrolyte that promotes Li anode passivation in lithium polysulfide solutions. To examine our concept, we assemble and characterize Li/Li2S9 liquid cells by using a porous carbon electrode as the current collector and a 0.25 m Li2S9 solution as the catholyte. Results show that Li/Li2S9 liquid cells are superior to conventional Li/S cells in specific capacity and capacity retention. We also find that use of LiNO3 as a co-salt in the Li2S9 catholyte significantly increases the cell's Coulombic efficiency. More importantly, the cells with LiNO3 have a similar to 2.5V voltage plateau before the end of charging and demonstrate a steep voltage rise at the end of charging. The former is indicative of the formation of elemental sulfur from soluble lithium polysulfides on the carbon electrode, and the latter provides a distinct signal for full charging. Electrochemical analyses on Li plating and stripping in Li2S9 catholyte solutions indicate that LiNO3 participates in the formation of a highly protective passivation film on the Li metal surface, which effectively prevents the Li anode from chemical reaction with polysulfide anions in the electrolyte and meanwhile prevents polysulfide anions from electrochemical reduction on the Li surface.

The microstructure and morphology of the sulfur-MWCNTs composite are characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) mapping and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). From these results, it is found that the synthesized sulfur has an orthorhombic phase and the MWCNTs are chemically well-dispersed over the whole surface of the synthesized sulfur. Electrochemical charge-discharge tests demonstrated that the sulfur-MWCNTs composite exhibits better capacity retention (63%) than that (16%) of the precipitated sulfur, which is also prepared by the direct precipitation method without MWCNTs. The enhanced cycle performance of the sulfur-MWCNTs is mainly attributed to the formation of highly conductive electron path due to the uniformly dispersed MWCNTs. Furthermore, in order to investigate the electrochemical reaction mechanism for the Li-S cell during the discharge process, the ac-impedance spectra as a function of the state of discharge are measured and analyzed.

In response to this issue, we develop a novel tannic acid and Au nanoparticle functionalized separator. The tannic acid and gold nanoparticles were modified onto commercial polypropylene separator through a two-step solution process. Due to a large number of phenolic hydroxyl groups contained in the modified layer and the strong polarity of the gold nanoparticles, the soluble polysulfide generated during battery cycling is well stabilized on the cathode side, slowing down the capacity fade brought by the shuttle effect. In addition, the modification effectively improves the electrolyte affinity of the separator. As a result of these benefits, the novel separator exhibits improved battery performance compared to the pristine polypropylene separator.

The physical and electrochemical performances of prepared SNG binary composite were characterized using x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge test. The SNG cathode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1135 mAh g(-1), and it sustains the capacity of 687 mAh g(-1) over the 50th cycle at 0.1C rate. The good electrochemical performance of SNG cathode is accredited to N-doping in graphene, which provides faster charge transfer pathway and suppresses the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The present study determines that the prepared SNG composite is a suitable material for cathode in Li-S battery application.

In this contribution, we introduce the yolk-shell structure into a freestanding carbon nanofibers film and construct a complete hollow yolk-shell TiO2/carbon nanofibers@void@TiN@carbon (TiO2-CNFs@void@TiN@C) composite. With inherent double conductive network and strong adsorption capability for polysulfides, the TiO2-CNFs@void@TiN@C composite can not only provide sufficient electrical contact for the insulating sulfur, but also effectively entrap polysulfides for prolonged cycle life. As a result, an excellent capacity retention ratio of 60.9% after 1000 cycles at 1 C as well as a high capacity of 688.5 mAh g(-1) at 5 degrees C rate is accomplished with the cells employing TiO2-CNFs@void@TiN@C as a cathode substrate for sulfur. Moreover, the TiO2-CNFs@void@TiN@C composite, with a high S mass loading of 9.5 mg cm(-2), delivers a superb areal capacity of 8.2 mAh cm(-2).

By utilizing them as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries, the in-operando Raman spectra and electrochemical tests indicated that the polysulfides shuttling effect could be substantially suppressed by the physical confinement and chemical adsorption due to these structural advantages. In addition, the well-developed hierarchical porous structure and ultrathin thickness were found to enhance the mass diffusion in the electrode, which increased the ion conductivity within the carbon framework. Therefore, the as-designed cathode was observed to accommodate the high sulfur loading amounts and demonstrated a high reversible capacity of 920.8 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C with high coulombic efficiency (similar to 100%). Moreover, the long-term stability test at 1C indicated that the cathode achieved a high reversible capacity of 702.1 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles with low decay rate of 0.07% per cycle.

However, the serve problems of Li-S batteries originating from the intrinsic poor conductivity of S and the dissolution and diffusion of dissoluble polysulfides in electrolytes are a major limitation. Herein, we demonstrated an all metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon material-based integrated sulfur cathode, which was constructed with 3D carbon nanofiber network with Fe microparticles (MIL1000) as interlayer on a polypropylene (PP) separator and 2D nanosheets (MIL900-H) as S host. Notably, the MIL900-H carbon nanosheets with many mesopores and doping oxygen possessed lithium-ion pathways and chemical adsorption of soluble polysulfides, and the MIL1000 interlayer could chemically adsorb, physically block polysulfide, and facilitate the kinetics of the cathode reaction. As a result, the integrated electrode that avoided the use of a metal current collector exhibited a high initial capacity of 1244.6 mAh/g at 0.1 C, fast Li2S nucleation, and excellent cycle stability with the capacity retention of 69.3% after 500 cycles at 1 C. Therefore, this rationale strategy of constructing an all MOF-derived-carbon material-based integrated electrode can be extended to other abundant MOF-derived materials for high energy density Li-S batteries.

However, its practical utilization is seriously hampered by shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). In this work, sandwich-structured Ti4O7-carbon nanofibers/Ti4O7/Ti4O7-carbon nanofibers (TC/T/TC) is developed as a functional interlayer to efficiently inhibit shuttle effect for high-performance Li-S batteries. The free-standing TC/T/TC interlayer with favourable flexibility is fabricated through alternately adopting electrospinning and spraying technique, then followed by in-situ high temperature carbonization and reduction. The resulting interlayer presents excellent physical-blocking and chemical-trapping effects for LiPSs since it has a dense middle layer of polar and conductive Ti4O7 with sufficient physicochemical sites for LiPSs trapping and conversion. Besides, the porous surface layers of Ti4O7-carbon nanofibers can provide enough space to restrain volume expansion and recycle the cathode fragments. Furthermore, the highly conductive interlayer can serve as a front current collector to reduce resistance and accelerate redox process. When applied to Li-S battery, CMK3/S cathode (sulfur areal density, 2 mg/cm(2)) with the TC/T/TC interlayer exhibits decent cycling capability and rate performance. It delivers an initial specific capacity of 1129 mAh g(-1) and its capacity remains at 686 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C rate. More excitingly, its initial specific capacity reaches 738 mAh g(-1) at 3 C rate, and the capacity maintains at 481 mAh g(-1) even after 3500 ultra-long cycles, with a high capacity retention of 65.2% and extremely low capacity decay of 0.00995% per cycle.

The microporous texture allows large amounts of sulfur to be infiltrated into the host (sulfur loading 80%). The resulting composite material possesses a high capacity, about 670 mA h g(-1), excellent capacity retention on cycling and good rate capability.

Exploring a low-temperature method for the incorporation of phosphorus atoms in the carbon framework is expected to change the chemical properties' of CNTs. Here, phosphorus-functionalized CNTs (PCNTs) were prepared by the direct hydrothermal treatment of a CNT-H3PO4 mixture at 170 degrees C. The PCNTs had a high phosphorus content of 1.66 at%, a specific surface area of 132 m(2), and an improved thermal stability with a weight loss peak at 694 degrees C during oxidation in pure oxygen. They showed good electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction with an onset potential of 0.20 V vs Hg/Hg2Cl2, an electron transfer number of 2.60, and a larger current density as well as improved cyclic stability compared with pristine CNTs. PCNTs were also used as conductive scaffolds for the cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries. The cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1 106 mAh.g(-1), a capacity retention of 80% from 0.1 to 1.0 degrees C, and a low decay rate of 0.25% per cycle during 100 cycles.

Herein, we have systematically synthesized water-distorted MOF (WDM) derived porous carbon via controlling the proportion of both water in a mixed solvent (dimethylformamide and water) and ligand in MOF-5 precursors (metal and ligand), which is categorized by its morphology (i.e. Cracked stone (closed), Tassel (open) and Intermediate (semi-open)). For example, decrease in water and increase in ligand content induce Cracked stone WDMs which showed the highest specific surface area (2742-2990 m(2)/g) and pore volume (2.81-3.28 cm(3)/g) after carbonization. Morphological effect of carbonized WDMs (CWDMs) on battery performance was examined by introducing electrolytes with different sulfur reduction mechanisms (i.e. DOL/DME and ACN(2)LiTFSITTE): Closed framework effectively confines polysulfide, whereas open framework enhances electrolyte accessibility. The initial capacities of the batteries were in the following order: Cracked stone > Intermediate > Tassel for DOL/DME and Intermediate > Tassel > Cracked stone for ACN(2)LiTFSI-TTE. To note, Intermediate CWDM exhibited the highest initial capacity and retained capacity after 100 cycles (1398 and 747 mAh/g) in ACN(2)LiTFSI-TTE electrolyte having advantages from both open and closed frameworks. In sum, we could correlate cathode morphology (openness and pore structure) and electrolyte type (i.e. polysulfide solubility) with lithium-sulfur battery performance.

Herein, we report a self-supporting cathode based on electrochemical active graphene-like RuO2 (GRO) without the incorporation of any carbon hosts and additives to synchronously acquire high mass, areal and volumetric capacities. It has been certified that dynamic evolutions of both conductive GRO host and sulfur guest during cell operation expedite chemisorption/conversion of LiPS and regulate nucleation/growth of solid Li2S, which enables GRO-S with medium sulfur loading to achieve an almost theoretical capacity at 0.2 C. Remarkably, the electrode with higher sulfur loading of 8.4 mg cm(-2) delivers mass, areal and volumetric capacities of 1225 mAh g(-1), 10.3 mAh cm 2 and 1981 mAh cm 3 at 0.2 C, respectively. The volumetric capacity records the highest value in reported Li-S batteries. The cathode material reported in this work opens new avenues for the development of high-energy-density and long-life Li-S batteries.

However, some natural hindrances, particularly fast capacity degradation resulting from the migration of dissolved poly sulfide intermediates, remain to be significant challenges prior to the practical applications. In this work, a composite interlayer of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) which are enriched by Co-based metal organic frameworks (ZIF-67) growth in-situ is exploited. Notably, physical blocking and chemical trapping abilities are obtained synergistically from the ZIF/CNFs interlayer, which enables to restrain the dissolution of poly sulfides and alleviate shuttle effect. Moreover, the three-dimensional fiber networks provide an interconnected conductive framework between each ZIF microreactor to promote fast electron transfer during cycling, thus contributing to excellent rate and cycling performance. As a result, Li-S cells with ZIF/CNFs interlayer show a high specific capacity of 1334 mAh g & minus;1 at 1 C with an excellent cycling stability over 300 cycles. Besides, this scalable and affordable electrospinning fabrication method provides a promising approach for the design of MOFs-derived carbon materials for high performance Li-S batteries.

However, the insulation of sulfur and the "shuttle effect" hinder the exertion of its capacity. Rational structure design and functionalization of host materials are crucial for the high-performance Li-S battery. Herein, the carbon foam (CF), whose fiber surface is decorated with polypyrrole (PPy)-modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO) flakes, is chosen as a 3D freestanding matrix to achieve a multifunctional framework with paper window-like microstructure. Acting as both sulfur host and current collector of cathode, the interconnecting carbon fibers of CF afford an integrated flexible conductive network to accelerate electronic transport; additionally, the rGO/PPy attached to carbon fibers not only improve the sulfur loading due to the large specific surface of rGO but also inhibit the "shuttle effect" because of chemisorption to polysulfides from PPy. Thanks to these advantages, the resulting flexible and freestanding electrode displays a high initial discharge capacity (1437 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, 1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) and excellent capacity retention at 1 C with average capacity loss of only 0.044% every cycle for over 100 cycles, suggesting that this rational structure design has the potential to be applied in the flexible, stable, and energy-dense Li-S battery.

However, the dissolution issue of sulfur cathodes and the dendrite growth of lithium anodes impede their practical application. In addition, the potential safety risks of Li-S batteries might be more serious than those of lithium-ion batteries because of the use of lithium-metal anodes. In this work, a multifunctional inorganic composite separator composed of a hydroxyapatite (HAP) framework and a Mn3O4/carbon nanotube (CNT) interlayer (H@CM) is fabricated for solving the abovementioned problems. The thermally inert HAP shows a superior stability at elevated temperatures and helps suppress electrolyte combustion, leading to enhanced cell safety. At the anode side, the polar and porous HAP framework promotes uniform lithium plating. At the same time, the Mn3O4/CNT interlayer at the cathode side effectively suppresses the dissolution of polysulfides. As a result, the Li-S battery assembled with the Hgcm separator exhibits an initial capacity of 1319 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintains 1000 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles, and it even achieves a capacity as high as 607 mAh g(-1) at 4 C (8.7 A g(-1)).

Engineering and functionalizing the cathode structure to trap Li(2)S(n)is a straightforward approach to address this issue. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived materials are applausive candidate host materials of sulfur, owing to the highly porous characteristic. In this work, a Ti-MOF-derived micro-sized cake-like carbon skeleton with in situ generated hierarchical pores and anatase TiO(2)crystalline grains is applied as an effective sulfur host in Li-S batteries. In this rational design, the pyrolytic porous carbon provides fast ion diffusion and physical confinement of polysulfides. The polar TiO(2)affords abundant anchoring sites to achieve chemical encapsulation of sulfur species and accelerate polysulfide conversion kinetics. Benefiting from the fast reaction kinetics, the hybrid sulfur cathode delivers an elevated cycling performance with a capacity decay of only 0.39 % per cycle at 0.5 C (1 C=1675 mA g(-1)) over 100 cycles. In addition, an improved rate capability of 620 mAh g(-1)at 2 degrees C is obtained. This work affords a facile method to design optimized cathodes towards advanced Li-S batteries.

In this study, graphene oxide (GO) layers are decorated onto Li metal anodes through a simple process of drop-casting and spray-coating. The self-assembly of GO is exploited to synthesize coatings having compact, mesoporous, and macroporous morphologies. The abilities of the GO coatings to suppress dendrite formation are compared through Li vertical bar Li symmetrical cell charging at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) for 2000 cycles-a particularly abusive test. The macroporous structure possesses the lowest impedance, whereas the compact structure excels in terms of stability. Moreover, GO exhibits a low nucleation overpotential and is transformed into reduced GO with enhanced conductivity during the operation of the cells; both factors synergistically mitigate the issue of dendrite formation. Li-S batteries incorporating the GO-decorated Li anodes exhibit an initial capacity of 850 mA h g(-1) and maintain their stability for 800 cycles at a C-rate of 1 C (1675 mA h g(-1)), suggesting the applicability of GO in future rechargeable batteries.

The big obstacle to realize the practical application of Li/S battery is to synchronously accelerate the redox kinetics and restrain the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte. On this account, ZnS nanotubes with abundant sulfur vacancies (ZnS1-x) are constructed and deposited onto a freestanding carbon cloth electrode for Li/S batteries. The combination of architectural and sulfur-vacancy engineering regulates the electronic structure of ZnS as well as its interactions with active sulfur, thus by facilitates ion/electron transfer, immobilizes lithium polysulfide, and accelerates sulfur reaction kinetics. As a consequence, a capacity of 1043 mAh g-1 is obtained under a low current density of 0.2 C, as well as a capacity retention of 524 mAh g-1 over 500 cycles at 1 C. This work presents a convenient and effective material design strategy to improve the performance of Li/S batteries and promote the practical process.

However, the insulation properties of sulfur and shuttle issue of polysulfides between electrolytes lead to poor coulombic efficiency and performance of sulfur cathode. Therefore, we use metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as pore-forming agent and glucose as primary carbon source to synthesize a honeycomb structured porous carbon (PC) material with high specific surface area (2151.9 m(2) g(-1)) and large mesopore volume (2.16 cm(3) g(-1)), which acts as the conductive skeleton for sulfur cathode. Furthermore, after mixing a trace of aluminum fluoride (AlF3) into sulfur electrode, the corresponding cycle performance and electrochemical stability have been further improved. The AlF3 center dot 3H(2)O/PC/S composition with 80 wt% sulfur loading exhibits the highest discharge capacity of 1298.1 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 1 C and maintains at 455.6 mAh g(-1) with similar to 99% coulombic efficiency after 500 cycles. This work supplies a facile and effective strategy for manufacture of more progressive porous carbonaceous sulfur host material and improving practical performance of Li-S batteries.

This manuscript reported that large-area freestanding MXene (Ti3C2Tx) film has been obtained through a scalable drop-casting method, significantly improving adhesion to the sulfur layer under the continuously bent. Titanium oxide anchored on holey Ti3C2Tx (TiO2/H-Ti3C2Tx) was also produced by the well-controlled oxidation of few-layer Ti3C2Tx which greatly facilitates lithium ion transport as well as prevents the shuttling of lithium polysulfides. Therefore, the obtained sandwich electrode has demonstrated a high capacity of 740 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and a high capacity retention of 81% at 1 C after 500 cycles. Flexible Li-S batteries based on this sandwich electrode have a capacity retention as high as 95% after bending 500 times.

However, the severe lithium polysulfides shuttling, self-discharge behavior and insulating end redox products (Li2S/Li2S2) remarkably hinder the performance. The cell configuration with an interlayer toward the cathode is an effective strategy to circumvent the above challenges. In this study, a carbon fibers/Ti3C2Tx interlayer is proposed to provide a physical shield and a strong chemical affinity to mitigate the polysulfides shuttling. The 3D cross-linked conductive networks of carbon fibers/Ti3C2Tx interlayers provide fast electron transfer channels and, thus, increase sulfur utilization and save "dead" sulfur. The dual effects of carbon fibers/Ti3C2Tx layers enable the Li-S cells with a high initial discharge capacity of 1380 mAhg(-1) at a current density of 0.1 C and an ultralow capacity loss of 0.044% per cycle within 1000 cycles at 1 C. We found that the family of MXenes plays unique roles in immobilizing and converting the polysulfides.

Here, we develop a heterostructure comprising hollow oxygen-deficient CeO2 (H-CeO2-x)/Co nanocrystals@N-doped carbon (NC) nanospheres as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The resulting H-CeO2-x/Co@NC effectively prevents the shuttling effect and accelerates trapping- diffusion-conversion of LiPSs through the interconnection of conductive networks and exposure of adsorptive/catalytic planes with different components. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of oxygen vacancies and the formation of heterogeneous interfaces strengthen the combination of H-CeO2-x/Co@NC with LiPSs and accelerate the decomposition of Li2S. The introduction of Co induces an electric field in CeO2, which generates highly active interfaces to improve the adsorption ability and redox conversion for LiPSs. Consequently, the H-CeO2-x/Co@NC-sulfur cathode exhibits an outstanding rate performance (626 mAh g(-1) at 5 C), superior cycling stability with a capacity retention of 81.6% after 1000 cycles at 2 C, and a high areal capacity of 5.3 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C with a high sulfur loading (5.4 mg cm(-2)). This work provides insights for the rational design of heterostructures for high-performance Li-S batteries through interface control and defect chemistry.

However, the insulativity of sulfur and the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides result in low utilization efficiency of active sulfur, fast capacity decay and inferior cycling stability, which pose the key challenge to their practical applications. Herein, a N, I-dual-doped hierarchical porous activated carbon (NIWFC) is successfully prepared for advanced Li-S batteries by the simple one-pot pyrolysis and hydrothermal processes. The obtained NIWFC owns interconnected porous framework with desirable specific surface area (2088.56 m(2) g(-1)) and large volume space (1.106 cm(3) g(-1)), which can accommodate high content of active sulfur and immobilize polysulfides through physical confinement. Moreover, the existence of N and I heteroatoms could effectively strengthen the chemical adsorption to polysulfides and create more active sites to enhance sulfur utilization. Attributed to these merits, impregnating sulfur into NIWFC (NIWFC/S) as cathode of Li-S batteries achieves a high initial discharge capacity of 1284.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (remaining at 916.7 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles) and the outstanding cycling stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.061% per cycle over 350 cycles at 1.0 C. This work provides a facile and cost-effective strategy to design a novel sustainable N, I-dual-doped porous carbon for high performance Li-S batteries and various energy storage fields.

Double modified defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets are successfully prepared by introducing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and amorphous carbon. The conductibility of the cathodes can be improved through the combination of amorphous carbon and rGO, which could also limit the dissolution of polysulfides. After annealing at different temperatures, it is found that the C-MoS2/rGO-6-S composite annealed at 600 degrees C yields a noticeably enhanced performance of lithium-sulfur batteries, with a high specific capacity of 572 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2C after 550 cycles, and 551 mAh.g(-1) even at 2C, much better than that of MoS2-S nanosheets (249 mAh.g(-1) and 149 mAh.g(-1)) and C-MoS2/rGO-S composites (334 mAh.g(-1) and 382 mAh.g(-1)).

Here, we report a multifunctional separator for trapping polysulfide and reusing the active sulfur species in Li-S batteries. The multifunctional separator was fabricated by coating the commercial polypropylene (PP) separator with a three-dimensional (3D) interwoven framework structure composed of 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets. Taking advantages of the excellent electrical conductivity and strong chemical interaction with polysulfide of Ti3C2Tx MXene, the ability in immobilizing and reusing of polysulfide for the multifunctional separator was significantly enhanced compared with pure CNTs modified separator. At mean time, the presence of CNTs effectively helps avoid the restacking of MXene nanosheets, resulting in an interfacial layer between separator and cathode with an interconnected conductive network, which can facilitate fast Li ion and electron transport and thus improve the rate capabilities and sulfur utilization. Moreover, the effect of MXene content on the structure and electrochemical performance were systematically investigated. At MXene content of 5% and CNTs/MXene mass loading of 0.16 mg cm(-2), the cell with CNTs/MXene-PP (CMP) separator delivered an initial capacity of 1415 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, a capacity retention of 614 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1 C with a low capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle in the 0.8-2.5 mg cm(-2) sulfurloaded cathode. Such 3D carbon nanotubes/MXene conductive framework provides great potential for developing efficient functional separator for high-performance Li-S batteries and can be easily applied in electrode materials for other electrochemical energy storage systems.

The liquid lithium polysulfide intermediates, connecting the Li-S battery electrochemical reaction of sulfur to Li2S, play a decisive role on battery performance. Herein, Co-Bi nanosheets intimately grown on reduced graphene oxides (Co-B-i/rGO) composite has been reported for the first time to regulate the polysulfide intermediates. The Co-B-i could not only chemically trap polysulfides but also propel the acceleration of polysulfide conversion enabled by a lower free energy and decomposition energy barrier in Li-S reaction process. Therefore, the Co-B-i/rGO-S cathode delivers a high capacity of 1334 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, impressive rate performance up to 8 C, outstanding cycling stability over 500 cycles at 1 C, and remarkable areal capacity of 8.3 mAh cm(-2) with a high sulfur mass loading of 9.5 mg cm(-2). The chemical binding strength, the Gibbs free energy and the energy barrier for transition state from theoretical calculations give a deep insight of polysulfide regulation by Co-B-i.

However, the dissolution of high-order polysulfide in electrolytes and low Coulombic efficiency of Li anode require excess electrolytes and Li metal, which significantly reduce the energy density of LSBs. Quasi-solid-state LSBs, where sulfur is encapsulated in the micropores of carbon matrix and sealed by solid electrolyte interphase, can operate under lean electrolyte conditions, but a low sulfur loading in carbon matrix (<40 wt %) and low sulfur unitization (<70%) still limit the energy density in a cell level. Here, we significantly increase the sulfur loading in carbon to 60 wt % and sulfur utilization to similar to 87% by dispersing sulfur in an oxygen-rich dense carbon host at a molecular level through strong chemical interactions of C-S and O-S. In an all-fluorinated organic lean electrolyte, the C/S cathode experiences a solid-state lithiation/delithiation reaction after the formation of solid electrolyte interphase in the first deep lithiation, completely avoiding the shuttle reaction. The chemically stabilized C/S composite retains a high reversible capacity of 541 mAh center dot g(-1) (based on the total weight of the C/S composite) for 200 cycles under lean electrolyte conditions, corresponding to a high energy density of 974 Wh center dot kg(-1). The superior electrochemical performance of the chemical bonding-stabilized C/S composite renders it a promising cathode material for highenergy and long-cycle-life LSBs.

To address those issues, herein, a uniform three-dimensional (3D) structure constructing carbon nanofibers (CNF) with polar Mo2C nanoparticles (Mo2C@CNF) was designed and coated onto one side of pristine conventional polypropylene separator (Mo2C@CNF/PP). The Mo2C@CNF with high electrical conductivity not only chemically constrained the LiPSs by chemical trapping, but also catalyzed the conversion of LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S. Cells with Mo2C@CNF/PP separator presented a high specific capacity of 732.9 mAh g(-1); 500 mAh g(-1) was kept, due to sluggish capacity decay (0.063 % per cycle), after 500 cycles.

However, the Li-S battery mostly suffers from low electronic conductivity and poor cycle capability. This study reports on a novel sandwich-structured cathode with optimized electrode architecture and interface design of the current collector (named as M-S-LTO) made by a facile layer-by-layer slurry coating process. The new integrated electrode is composed of a micro-cracked current collector (MCC) based on multi-wall carbon nanotubes, a middle layer of sulfur/carbon material and an upper current collector&interlayer (UCC&I) based on multi-wall carbon nanotubes and Li4Ti5O12 nanospheres. The M-S-LTO cathode produces a better electrochemical performance because of its improved internal electrical and ionic conductivity, stable structure and mitigation of shuttle effect, in contrast to the sulfur electrode with either an MCC (M-S cathode) or a smooth aluminum foil current collector (S cathode). At a current density of 0.2 C, the Li-S battery with the M-S-LTO cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1248.6 mAh g(-1) and retains a reversible capacity of 960.3 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. Even at 1 C, its capacity can reach 773.4 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. The battery with the M-S-LTO cathode shows a higher cycle performance than most of other reported cells based on the interlayer design with a comparable sulfur loading. With the enhanced electrochemical performance, the new cathode offers a promising avenue to fabricate high-performance Li-S batteries.

In the past decades, various novel electrodes and electrolytes have been studied to improve the performance of Li-S batteries. However, the very limited lifespan and rate performance of Li-S batteries originating from the dissolution and diffusion of long-chain polysulfides in liquid electrolytes, and the intrinsic poor conductivity of S severely hinder their practical application. Herein, an electrospinning method was developed to fabricate a thin conductive interlayer consisting of meso-/microporous N/O dual-doping carbon nanofiber (CNF). The freestanding 3D interwoven structure with conductive pathways for electrons and ions can enhance the contact between polysulfides and N/O atoms to realize the highly robust trapping of polysulfides via the extremely polar interaction. Consequently, combining the meso-microporous N/O dual-doping CNF interlayer with a monodispersed S nanoparticle cathode results in a superior electrochemical performance of 862.5 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.2 C and a cycle decay as low as 0.08% per cycle. An area specific capacity of 5.22 mAh/cm2 can be obtained after 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a high S loading of 7.5 mg/cm(2).

Vanadium Sulfide@Sulfur Composites as High-Performance Cathode for Advanced Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						cathodes; lithium-sulfur batteries; metal sulfides; nanocomposites	POROUS CARBON MICROSPHERES; TEMPLATED FORMATION; VS2 NANOSHEETS; SURFACE; ANODE; NANOPARTICLES; POLYSULFIDES; CONVERSION; NANOTUBES; STORAGE	Lithium-sulfur batteries have attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to their high theoretical capacity of 1675 mAh g(-1) and low cost. However, the shuttle effect caused by the dissolution and migration of polysulfides and the destruction of cathode particles due to volume expansion during lithiation are key issues for their practical application. Herein, a one-pot hydrothermal preparation of a VS2@S composite as a cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries is reported. The VS2@S composite shows uniform and flowerlike aggregates of nanoparticles of sizes around 50-80 nm. The porous structure among VS2@S nanoparticles can accommodate the volumetric expansion occurring during sulfur lithiation. Adsorption capability testing proves a strong interaction between VS2 and polysulfides. Therefore, the as-prepared VS2@S composite exhibits good electrochemical performance, with a discharge capacity of 413 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at a 1 C rate. After various rate cyclings from 0.1 to 2 C, the VS2@S electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 884 mAh g(-1) when the current density switches to 0.1 C, demonstrating a notable improvement compared with pure sulfur electrodes.

Here single manganese (Mn) atoms implanted in oxygen and nitrogen double-doped hollow carbon sphere frameworks (Mn/C-(N, O)) are prepared as electrocatalyst and anchoring sites for lithium sulfur batteries. O, N-coordinated single Mn atoms can rich in atomic active sites, anchor polysulfides through strong Lewis acid-base interactions. Meanwhile, Mn cofactors show high catalytic activity on the conversion reaction of polysulfides. Moreover, the abundant pores in conductive carbon frameworks can facilitate electrolyte diffusion while simultaneously promote the dynamic protection of the cathode structure during cycling. Consequently, S@Mn/C-(N, O) exhibits an excellent cycling stability with an initial capacity of similar to 900 mAh g(-1) at 1 C with only 0.05% capacity decay per cycle after 1000 cycles. The theoretical simulation results and the enhanced electrochemical performance show the important role of single atom in accelerating polysulfides transformation and suppressing the "shuttle effect".

Driven by this background, a flexible sulfur host material composed of FeCo2S4 nanotube arrays grown on the surface of carbon cloth is designed for a binder-free cathode of the Li-S battery through two-step hydrothermal method. Among the rest, the interconnected carbon fiber skeleton of the composite electrode ensures the basic electrical conductivity, whereas the FeCo2S4 nanotube arrays not only boost the electron and electrolyte transfer but also inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides because of their strong chemical adsorption. Meanwhile, the hollow structures of these arrays can provide a large inner space to accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur. More significantly, the developed composite electrode also reveals a catalytic action for accelerating the reaction kinetic of the Li-S battery. As a result, the FeCo2S4/CC@S electrode delivers a high discharge capacity of 1384 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 C and simultaneously exhibits a stable Coulombic efficiency of about 98%.

Due to the excellent electronic conductivity and dense sheet constructure of graphene, it can improve the conductive network, reduce the pores of polypropylene (PP) membrane, and consequently inhibit the penetration of polysulfide in Li-S batteries. More importantly, the co-doped B and N atoms play the role of Lewis acid-base, which have a strong adsorption capacity to lithium ions and as well as sulfur ions during reactions, and thus inhibit the "shuttle effect" and accelerate the conversion reactions of polysulfides. Based on this multifunctional interlayer, the cells exhibit a high initial capacity of 1448 mAh g(-1), and achieve a reversible capacity of 578 mAh g(-1) under a large rate of 2 C after 350 cycles with a capacity decay of 0.015 % per cycle. These results demonstrate the enormous potential of the B/N co-doped graphene as the interlayer for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Subsequently, Li-S batteries receive significant research attention. In this report, a comprehensive analysis on the effect of key factors on the battery performance, namely the peak discharge capacity and the cycle life, is conducted using machine learning. Data for 1660 cells from 353 papers in the literature are collected and analyzed via association rule mining. The analysis concludes that encapsulation material type and amount are critical for high capacities and enhanced cycle life. The use of structured carbons such as porous carbons or carbon nanotubes in encapsulated cathodes leads to superior battery performance. Likewise, electrolyte design has a key influence on the battery performance, particularly in electrolyte starved cells. The results confirm that the most promising pathway forward in Li-S batteries is materials design, predominantly design of encapsulation cathodes and electrolytes that succeed at low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratios and high sulfur loadings.

The as-assembled interlayer has been demonstrated to be responsible for the fast conversion kinetics of polysulfides, the inhibition of polysulfide shuttle effect, as well as the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase(SEI) layer. By means of spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis, we further found THPP plays a key role in accelerating the conversion of polysulfides into low-ordered lithium sulfides and suppressing the loss of polysulfides, thus rendering the as-designed lithium-sulfur battery in this work a high capacity, excellent rate performance and long-term stability. Even at low temperatures, the capacity decay rate was only 0.036 % per cycle for 1700 cycles.

However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) between electrodes results in rapid capacity degradation. Herein, a strategy which combines the design of both chemical interaction and microstructure of interlayer was proposed to suppress the shuttle effect. The chemical interaction between different functionalized MOFs and LiPSs was systematically studied to find the best candidate. Furthermore, an interlayer with ordered structure was constructed via the layer-by-layer assembly of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on graphene (UiO-66-NH2@graphene) to create sinuous channels which can better impede the diffusion process of LiPSs by the strong adsorption of MOF toward LiPSs. Consequently, in comparison to the battery with a bare separator, the ordered interlayer increased the initial discharge capacity of battery by 28.98% at 1.0 C and lowered the capacity decay rate remarkably from 0.10% to 0.067% per cycle, indicating that the design of chemical interaction and microstructure paves the way for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) redox conversion and shuttle effect severely damage the sulfur utilization, rate performance, and cycling stability of Li-S batteries. In this work, we report that Ru-doping induced phase transformation from MoP to Mo4P3 (Ru-Mo4P3) could significantly facilitate the electrocatalytic conversion of LiPS. When Ru-Mo4P3 nanoparticles (NPs) are decorated on hollow carbon spheres (HCS), the S/HCS-Ru-Mo4P3 electrode delivers high reversible capacities of 1178 mAh g(-1) and 660 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and 4C in Li-S battery, respectively. The rate performance of the developed S/HCS-Ru-Mo4P3 is among the best of the reported transition metal phosphide cathodes for Li-S batteries. When the S loading is as high as 6.6 mg cm(-2), S/HCS-Ru-Mo4P3 retains a reversible areal capacity of 5.6 mAh cm(-2) after 50 cycles, higher than that of the commercial Li-ion battery (4 mAh cm(-2)). The excellent Li-S battery performance can be attributed to the intrinsically active Ru-Mo4P3 phase combining with hollow carbon structure, which significantly facilitates the electrocatalytic conversion and entrapment of LiPS.

Herein, we report a novel catalyst that exhibits a network structure of dense nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (CNT) embedded with Co/Co2P. The dense nitrogendoped CNT plays the role of "tentacles" to capture and confine the polysulfide via physical and chemical interactions, and the embedded Co/Co2P that wrapped by the dense CNT acts as an electrocatalyst to catalyze the sulfur redox. As a result, the Li-S battery using Co/Co2P@N-CNT modified separator can deliver a capacity of 1405 mAh g-1 at 0.1C. It can also maintain a capacity of 647 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles, with a very low decay rate of 0.07% per cycle at 1C. Importantly, a high reversible areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm-2 can be obtained over 60 cycles, even under a raised sulfur content of 4.8 mg cm-2. This work provides a deep understanding of the architecture design of a highly efficient electrocatalyst for high-performance Li-S battery.

We report a solvent-free, low-cost, low-energy-consumption, safe, and low-risk process to make the material development and production compatible for sustainable technologies. Different coating protocols were developed to produce PEDOT-coated sulfur powders with electrical conductivity in the range of 10(-8)-10(-)(5) S/cm. The raw sulfur powder (used as the reference) and (low-, optimum-, high-) PEDOT-coated sulfur powders were used to assemble lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells with a high sulfur loading of similar to 4.5 mg/cm(2). Long-term galvanostatic cycling at C/10 for 100 cycles showed that the capacity fade was mitigated by similar to 30% for the cells containing the optimum-PEDOT-coated sulfur in comparison to the reference Li-S cells with raw sulfur. Rate capability, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance analyzes confirmed the improved behavior of the PEDOT-coated sulfur as an active material for lithium-sulfur batteries. The Li-S cells containing optimum-PEDOT-coated sulfur showed the highest reproducibility of their electrochemical properties. A wide variety of bulk and surface characterization methods including conductivity analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and NMR spectroscopy were used to explain the chemical features and the superior behavior of Li-S cells using the optimum-PEDOT-coated sulfur material. Moreover, postmortem [SEM and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)] analyzes of uncoated and coated samples allowed us to exclude any significant effect at the electrode scale even after 70 cycles.

Herein, a facile and scalable approach to fabricate porous carbon is derived from common okra wastes, okra shells, as a matrix for sulfur active materials. Especially, the material calcined under NH3 (N-doped biomass-derived porous carbon [N-OSC]) with a high specific surface area of 2702 m(2) g(-1) and large pore volume (0.17 cm(3) g(-1)) provides necessary physical adsorption, resulting in the 69.71 wt% loading of sulfur and excellent trapping capacity for polysulfides during the redox process. Furthermore, N element can act as catalytic active sites to facilitate redox conversion from polysulfides to Li2S. Benefiting from the aforementioned advantages, the cell of the N-OSC/S electrode manifests superior electrochemical performance. The initial capacity is found up to be 1387 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 C and 750 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C rate (where 1 C = 1672 mA h g(-1)). For durability evaluations, the capacity is maintained at 416 mA h g(-1) at 2 C after 1000 cycles with a mere decay of 0.05% per cycle.

Here, we demonstrate an nucleophilic substitution reaction between polysulfides and binder functional groups can unexpectedly immobilizes the polysulfides. The substitution reaction is verified by UV-visible spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectra. The immobilization of polysulfide is in situ monitored by synchrotron based sulfur Kedge X-ray absorption spectra. The resulting electrodes exhibit initial capacity up to 20.4 mAh/cm(2), corresponding to 1199.1 mAh/g based on a micron-sulfur mass loading of 17.0 mg/cm(2). The micron size sulfur transformed into nano layer coating on the cathode binder during cycling. Directly usage of nano-size sulfur promotes higher capacity of 33.7 mAh/cm(2), which is the highest areal capacity reported in Li-S battery. This enhance performance is due to the reduced shuttle effect by covalently binding of the polysulfide with the polymer binder.

Nevertheless, the detrimental shuttle effect, volume expansion, and electrical insulation of sulfur, have hindered their application. To improve the cyclability, a functional host, consisting of Co nanoparticles and N-doped hollow graphitized carbon (Co-NHGC) material, is elaborated, which has the advantages of: 1) the graphitized carbon material working as an electronic matrix to improve the utilization rate of sulfur; 2) the hollow structure relieving the stress change caused by volume expansion; 3) the rich active sites catalyze the electrochemical reaction of sulfur and entrap polysulfides. These advantages significantly improve the performance of the lithium-sulfur batteries. Accordingly, the S@Co-NHGC cathode exhibits excellent initial specific capacity, high coulombic efficiency, and excellent rate performance. This work utilizes a novel method of dopamine in situ etching of a metal-organic framework to synthetize the Co-NHGC host of sulfur, which will hopefully provide inspiration for other energy materials.

Herein, we present an oxygenated metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived nitrogen-doped microporous carbon (OMNC) interlayer to mitigate the shuttling of polysulfides. The OMNC interlayer with abundant carboxyl and hydroxyl groups is highly permselective to Li+ ions but efficiently suppress the penetration of undesired S-n(2-) ions to the anode side owing to electrostatic interactions. The doped nitrogen in OMNC can enhance the binding with polysulfides, thus alleviating the shuttle effect. The strong affinity of oxygenated groups and doped nitrogen with polysulfides is demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, the highly conductive OMNC interlayer can also act as a second current collector to promote electron transportation, thus strengthening the utilization of the active material and improving the cycling performance of the cells. At a high sulfur loading up to 3 mg cm(-2), the multi-walled carbon nanotubes/sulfur (CNTs/S) cathode matched with the OMNC interlayer exhibits a reversible capacity of 580.5 mAh g(-1) after 610 cycles at 1 C, corresponding to an average capacity loss per cycle of 0.038%. These results suggest a new way to advanced Li-S batteries using a MOF-derived multifunctional interlayer.

We report a facile, environment friendly, soft approach and scalable synthesis of a sulfur/graphene/multiwalled carbon nanotube (S/GN/MWCNTs) composite as a cathode for Li-S batteries by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The 2D graphene nanosheets and 1D carbon nanotubes have been chosen as a scaffold because of their conductive carbon skeleton and high specific surface area. In the composite, the carbon nanotubes can not only significantly enhance the conductivity, but also effectively tune the mesoporous structure. The as-prepared S/GN/MWCNTs hybrid electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1135.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C. Moreover, at a high current rate of 0.8C, it exhibits excellent cyclability and coulombic efficiency, the reversible charge capacity stays at 702.3 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles and the coulombic efficiency is up to 96.3%.

However, their wide application is still limited by the rapid capacity fading. Herein, polydopamine (PDA)-coated N-doped hierarchical porous carbon spheres (NPC@PDA) are reported as sulfur hosts for high-performance Li-S batteries. The NPC core with abundant and interconnected pores provides fast electron/ion transport pathways and strong trapping ability towards lithium polysulfide intermediates. The PDA shell could further suppress the loss of lithium polysulfide intermediates through polar-polar interactions. Benefiting from the dual function design, the NPC/S@PDA composite cathode exhibits an initial capacity of 1331 mAh g(-1) and remains at 720 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. At the pouch cell level with a high sulfur mass loading, the NPC/S@PDA composite cathode still exhibits a high capacity of 1062 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.4 mA cm(-2).

In this work, a novel hierarchically porous polypyrrole sphere (PPS) was successfully prepared by using silica as hard-templates. As-prepared PPS was slurry-coated on the separator, which could reduce the polarization phenomenon of the sulfur cathode, and efficiently immobilize polysulfides. As expected, high sulfur utilization was achieved by suppressing the shuttle effect. When tested in the lithium-sulfur battery, it exhibited a high capacity of 855 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, and delivered a reversible capacity of 507 mAhg(-1) at 3 C, showing excellent electrochemical performance.

Nevertheless, the shuttle effect caused by diffusion of polysulfides limit their application. In this work, the different dimensions of g-C3N4 nanomaterials (2D g-C3N4 nanosheets and 3D g-C3N4 nanomesh) were doped in S electrode. Because of the large specific surface area of 3D g-C3N4 nanomesh and strong chemical adsorption of polysulfides can provide better effect for inhibition of shuttling effect and its proper electron passage make electrochemical kinetics of lithium-sulfur battery enhanced. The discharge specific capacity of the 3D g-C3N4 battery is up to 731 mAh/g and longer cycling performance with 540 mAh/g after 180 cycles. This experiment paves the way forward for the application of g-C3N4 on Li-S batteries.

To avoid the shuttle effect and build the safety and stability of the Li-S battery system, we demonstrated a new conductive carbon as the host material with 0.35-nm micropores and mesopores prepared by a one-step process for a quasi-solid electrolyte. PVDF acted as a precursor and PMMA acted as an additive in this one-step preparation process. In addition, the mesopores enhanced the contact area and the content of sulfur, while the 0.35-nm micropores provided a trap site for the polysulfide by an effective physical absorption when the sulfur embedded in the host material. Finally, the PVDF-based quasi-solid polymer electrolyte avoided the inflammable and explosive risk and achieved an initial specific capacity of 1038 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, and maintained at 441 mAh g(-1) even after 500 cycles (a decay of 0.12% per cycle).

Before etching the resulting mesoporous carbon acquires a specific surface area of 206.5 m(2) g(-1) and a pore volume of 0.29 cm(3) g(-1), and in its sulfur-loading composite-1 the S-content is similar to 45.2 wt%. After etching the modified mesoporous carbon exhibits a great improvement in porosity (Surface area similar to 650.2 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume -0.77 cm(3) g(-1)) and/or in sulfur-loading amount (i. e., the S-content of composite similar to 2 - 50.0 wt%). At 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)), a composite-2 cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 925.1 mAh g(-1) in 2nd cycle and maintains a specific value of 781.1 mAh g(-1) in the 140th cycle, much higher than those of composite-1 cathode. Both of the two composite electrodes display a slight increase of electrolyte-solution resistance and surface-film resistance and an obvious decrease of chargetransfer resistance. By comparison, these resistances of composite-2 are smaller than those of composite1. This, together with the acid-modified structural parameters reasonably account for the enhanced electrochemical properties of composite-2. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

As a free-standing cathode of Li-S battery, the unique structural CNF/S-Cu/CNF composite cathodes exhibit high capacity and rate capability as well as long cycling stability. The electrodes can deliver a reversible capacity of 1295 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1), and maintain more than 530 mAh g(-1) even at a high current rate of 1 A g(-1) after 300 cycles along with a Coulombic efficiency close to 100 %. The exceptional performance of CNF/S-Cu/CNF as cathode in Li-S batteries is attributed to a synergistic contribution from the CNF layers, the decorated-Cu nanoparticles and the doped N element in CNF, which can physically and chemically stabilize S and provide fast electronic conductivity.

Here, we report on the impact of temperature on Li-S cell performance. The Li-S coin-cells were prepared by using S infiltrated vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays (S-CNT) as cathodes and lithium metal foils as anodes. The cells were operated at 25, 50, 70 and 90 degrees C. Higher temperature operation resulted in higher specific capacity, better rate capability and more stable performance. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies reveal the major impact of temperature on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li foil. Thicker SEI with higher content of inorganic phase formed at elevated temperatures greatly reduced both the dendrite formation and the capacity fading resulted from the irreversible losses of S. At 70 degrees C specific capacities up to similar to 700 mAh g(-1) were achieved at an ultra-high current density of 3.3 A g(-1). At 90 degrees C and the same current density Li-S cells showed an average capacity of similar to 400 mAh g(-1) and stable performance for over 150 cycles. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The self-standing composites can be easily prepared by freeze drying a frozen graphene oxide-carbon nanotube suspension, and then impregnated with sulfur by melt diffusion. Composites obtained in this way are physicochemically characterized by elemental analysis, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), electron microscopy and gas adsorption, showing a three dimensional macroporous graphene-based architecture in which sulfur is homogeneously distributed. The performance of self-standing composites with sulfur loadings over 4.0 mg cm(-2) is evaluated as binder-free positive electrodes for Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Results show that the incorporation of just 2 wt.% of CNTs significantly improves both the specific capacity and capacity retention compared to the results shown by the CNT-free samples, and slightly improves the performance of thermally reduced samples. More importantly, reversible specific capacity values over 500 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.1C after 100 charge/discharge cycles are obtained for either thermally reduced and CNT containing samples, which in terms of areal capacity correspond to values over 2.0 mAh cm(-2).

The low-density sulfur cooperated with the light-weight carbon substrate realizes electrochemical cycle stability, but leads to worse volumetric energy density. Here, nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanofibers as novel substrate for sulfur not only anchor lithium polysulfides to enhance the cycle stability of sulfur cathode, but also contribute to the high volumetric capacity of the S/nickel ferrite composite. Specifically, the S/ nickel ferrite composite presents an initial volumetric capacity of 1,281.7 mA h cm(-composite)(-3) at 0.1 C rate, 1.9 times higher than that of S/carbon nanotubes, due to the high tap density of the S/nickel ferrite composite.

These advantages position biomass materials as excellent candidates to solve problems of environmental pollution, primarily by substitution of less sustainable counterparts. This also applies to energy storage systems such as batteries, where several components have large environmental impacts. Lithium-Sulfur batteries have, in this context, been extensively researched to cope with the growing energy needs, and are expected to foresee a growing commercialization. Specifically, advances in the use of renewable cathode materials for Li-S batteries is a field that has been widely addressed in recent years, with carbonaceous materials (C) and/or activated carbons (AC), obtained from biomass, being intensively studied. We here reviewed this field through a classification and discussion of carbonaceous materials from natural waste according to the type of biomass: (1) woody, (2) herbaceous and agricultural, (3) aquatic, (4) animal and human, and (5) contaminated and industrial biomass waste materials. In addition, all porous carbons or activated carbons used as sulfur hosts have been exhaustively evaluated in terms of origin, synthesis parameters, physical properties, and electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries. The purpose is to provide a general description of the progress in the preparation of carbons from biomass resources, examine the textural and electrochemical properties of these materials focusing on the last decade, and also to present an outlook for future research in this developing area.

However, the serious capacity fading resulting from the shuttle effect hinders its commercial application. Encapsulating small S2-4 molecules into the pores of ultramicroporous carbon (UMC) can eliminate the dissolved polysulfides, thus completely inhibiting the shuttle effect. Nevertheless, the sulfur loading of S2-4/UMC is usually not higher than 1 mg cm(-2) because of the limited pore volume of UMC, which is a great challenge for small sulfur cathode. In this paper, by applying ultralight 3D melamine formaldehyde-based carbon foam (MFC) as a current collector, we dramatically enhanced the areal sulfur loading of the S2-4 electrode with good electrochemical performances. The 3D skeleton of MFC can hold massive S2-4/UMC composites and act as a conductive network for the fast transfer of electrons and Li+ ions. Furthermore, it can serve as an electrolyte reservoir to make a sufficient contact between S2-4 and electrolyte, enhancing the utilization of S2-4. With the MFC current collector, the S2-4 electrode reaches an areal sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2) and performs a capacity of 839.8 mA h g(-1) as well as a capacity retention of 82.5% after 100 cycles. The 3D MFC current collector provides a new insight for the application of Li-S batteries with high areal small sulfur loading and excellent cycle stability.

Herein, we report a novel sulfur host material based on "sea urchin"-like cobalt nanoparticle embedded and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube/nanopolyhedra (Co-NCNT/NP) superstructures for Li-S batteries. The hierarchical micromesopores in Co-NCNT/NP can allow efficient impregnation of sulfur and block diffusion of soluble polysulfides by physical confinement, and the incorporation of embedded Co nanoparticles and nitrogen doping (similar to 4.6 at %) can synergistically improve the adsorption of polysulfides, as evidenced, by beaker cell tests. Moreover, the conductive networks of Co-NCNT/NP interconnected by nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) can facilitate electron transport and electrolyte infiltration. Therefore, the specific capacity, rate capability, and cycle stability of Li-S batteries are significantly enhanced. As a result, the Co-NCNT/NP based cathode (loaded with 80 wt % sulfur) delivers a high discharge capacity of 1240 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C (based on the weight of sulfur), high rate capacity (755 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C), and ultralong cycling life (a very low capacity decay of 0.026% per cycle over 1500 cycles at 1.0 C). Remarkably, the composite cathode with high areal sulfur loading of 3.2 mg cm(-2) shows high rate capacities and stable cycling performance over 200 cycles.

Herein, a novel lithium-sulfur cell design is proposed, which consists of sulfur and magnesium-aluminum-layered double hydroxides (MgAl-LDH)-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite cathode with a modified polymer separator produced by dual side coating approaches (one side: graphene and the other side: aluminum oxides). The composite cathode functions as a combined electrocatalyst and polysulfide scavenger, greatly improving the reaction kinetics and stabilizing the Coulombic efficiency upon cycling. The modified separator enhances further Lit-ion or electron transport and prevents undesirable contact between the cathode and dendritic lithium on the anode. The proposed lithium-sulfur cell fabricated with the as-prepared composite cathode and modified separator exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1375 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C rate, excellent cycling stability during 200 cycles at 1 C rate, and superior rate capability up to 5 C rate, even with high sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm(-2). In addition, the findings that found in postmortem chracterization of cathode, separator, and Li metal anode from cycled cell help in identifying the reason for its subsequent degradation upon cycling in Li-S cells.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is still hindered by several technical issues; the notorious polysulfide shuttling and sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics. In this work, unique hierarchical Fe3-xC@C hollow microspheres as an advanced sulfur immobilizer and promoter for enabling high-efficiency Li-S batteries is developed. The porous hollow architecture not only accommodates the volume variation upon the lithiation-delithiation processes, but also exposes vast active interfaces for facilitated sulfur redox reactions. Meanwhile, the mesoporous carbon coating establishes a highly conductive network for fast electron transportation. More importantly, the defective Fe3-xC nanosized subunits impose strong LiPS adsorption and catalyzation, enabling fast and durable sulfur electrochemistry. Attributed to these structural superiorities, the obtained sulfur electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, i.e., high areal capacity of 5.6 mAh cm(-2), rate capability up to 5 C, and stable cycling over 1000 cycles with a low capacity fading rate of 0.04% per cycle at 1 C, demonstrating great promise in the development of practical Li-S batteries.

And, sulfur-porous carbon (S@PC) composite as cathode material of lithium sulfur battery is synthesized by a melt diffusion method. The as-prepared PC has both strongly physical adsorption and tightly chemical bonding of polysulfides due to high porosity with the interlacement of micropores, mesopores and macropores/macrohollows, large surface area, and rich heteroatom tri-doping, resulting in an excellent electrochemical performance as a sulfur host for lithium sulfur battery cathodes. Among the synthesized S@PC composites, due to the optimum melting time, S@PC 12 h composite electrode has more effective nitrogen-containing and oxygen-containing groups, and stronger S-O bonds than other S@PC composites. As a result, S@PC 12 h composite electrode shows a high initial specific discharge capacity of 1471 mAhg(-1) at 0.1C rate, a super rate capacity of 790 mAhg(-1) at 1C after 20 cycles of low rate, an excellent long cycle stability at 1C. Appropriate macropores and/or macrohollows can not only provide charge transfer channels, but also effectively adsorb crystalline sulfur to a certain extent, result in the improvement of electrochemical performance for S@PC composites.

Herein, we designed and constructed a sulfur immobilizer with multi-level sulfur storage space, which consists of the cluster of Co@TiO2 hollow spheres tightly wrapped by graphene oxide (labeled as Co@TiO2/GO). This structure provided a multi-level sulfur storage space, that is, the sulfur was encapsulated in the cavity of the Co@TiO2 hollow spheres, between Co@TiO2 spheres and GO sheets and in the interlaminar pores of GO. This enabled the inner and outer surfaces of the Co@TiO2 hollow spheres to better participate in the conversion reaction of lithium polysulfides (LPS). Moreover, the incorporated Co nanoparticles and abundance of oxygen vacancies effectively captured LPS and boosted their redox reaction kinetics. Therefore, this multi-level sulfur storage space is very beneficial to the storage and blockade of polysulfides and the improvement of the energy storage performance of the lithium-sulfur battery. Due to these beneficial structural features, the initial discharge capacity of Co@TiO2/GO/S cathode reached 807 mAh g(-1) at 1C with a slow decay rate of 0.053% per cycle for 500 cycles, and high rate performance with a capacity of 552 mAh g(-1) at 5C.

However, the insulating nature, shuttling of soluble polysulfides and volumetric expansion of sulfur electrodes seriously give rise to the rapid capacity fading and low utilization. In this work, these issues are significantly alleviated by both physically and chemically restricting sulfur species in fluorinated porous triazine-based frameworks (FCTF-S). One-step trimerization of perfluorinated aromatic nitrile monomers with elemental sulfur allows the simultaneous formation of fluorinated triazine-based frameworks, covalent attachment of sulfur and its homogeneous distribution within the pores. The incorporation of electronegative fluorine in frameworks provides a strong anchoring effect to suppress the dissolution and accelerate the conversion of polysulfides. Together with covalent chemical binding and physical nanopore-confinement effects, the FCTF-S demonstrates superior electro-chemical performances, as compared to those of the sulfur-rich covalent triazine-based framework without fluorine (CTF-S) and porous carbon delivering only physical confinement. Our approach demonstrates the potential of regulating lithium-sulfur battery performances at a molecular scale promoted by the porous organic polymers with a flexible design.

The theory is based on expressing the nucleation rate of solid products in terms of the surface oversaturation of the precipitating species and rewriting the classical Kolmogorov-Avrami model in the form of a differential system of equations. By coupling this system of equations with the multicomponent transport equations we are able to explain qualitatively well the decrease of the specific capacity with increasing discharge rates and the characteristics of the discharge curves under variable discharge currents in Li-S batteries. Special attention is given to accurately determine the values of model parameters from experimental data, including the solubility constants of the solid products and the mobilities and diffusivities of the ions. The anodes of the batteries used in our analysis were made using Li foils and the cathodes were fabricated using freestanding carbon nanotube foams, on which solid sulfur was uniformly distributed to maximize the dissolution rate. The experimental data combined with the theoretical analysis show that the capacity limitation in our batteries is due to surface passivation by the final reaction products. In order to increase the specific capacity of Li-S batteries under normal discharge rates we conclude that it is better to avoid the solid precipitation of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) by using electrolytes with a high solubility of LiPS. In addition, it is better to use catalyst particles in the cathode that would promote the nucleation rate at specified locations. The number of catalyst particles should not be too small to avoid electrolyte oversaturation or too large to avoid the rapid passivation of the carbon surface with solid products.

Herein, a simple solution-based method is reported to produce organic-inorganic superlattices and demonstrate that the pyrolysis of the organic compound enables tuning their interlayer space. This strategy is exemplified here by combining polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) with WSe2 within PVP/WSe2 superlattices. The annealing of such heterostructures results in N-doped graphene/WSe2 (NG/WSe2) superlattices with a continuously adjustable interlayer space in the range from 10.4 to 21 angstrom. Such NG/WSe2 superlattices show a metallic electronic character with outstanding electrical conductivities. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations further demonstrate that these superlattices are excellent sulfur hosts at the cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSB), being able to effectively reduce the lithium polysulfide shuttle effect by dual-adsorption sites and accelerating the sluggish Li-S reaction kinetics. Consequently, S@NG/WSe2 electrodes enable LSBs characterized by high sulfur usages, superior rate performance, and outstanding cycling stability, even at high sulfur loadings, lean electrolyte conditions, and at the pouch cell level. Overall, this work not only establishes a cost-effective strategy to produce artificial superlattice materials but also pioneers their application in the field of LSBs.

GO has good compatibility with carbon black, the main component of the cathode in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Here, the cationic polymer having the QDMAEMA unit was intentionally grafted onto GO to decrease the shuttle effect by increasing the chemical adsorption of polysulfide (PS). In addition, when CNT was mixed with CPGO, the compatibility with carbon black was found to be further increased. The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery with a sulfur-deposited Super P (R) carbon black (S/C) cathode coated with a mixture of CPGO and CNT was found to have much improved cell performance compared to those coated without any coating material, with only CPGO, with the mixture of GO and CNT, and with the mixture of PQDMAEMA and CNT. For example, the Li-S battery with the cathode coated using the mixture of CPGO and CNT retained a discharge capacity of 744 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.2C-rate, while those of the Li-S batteries with bare S/C and CPGO-S/C cathodes were found to be much smaller, i.e., 488 mA h g(-1) and 641 mA h g(-1), respectively, under the same conditions. Therefore, the mixture of CPGO with CNT as the cathode-coating material showed a synergetic effect to enhance the cell performance of the Li-S battery system.

Herein, inspired by highly efficient natural enzymes with Fe/N active sites for oxygen reduction reactions, we report a periodic expansion catalysis concept, i.e., Ru and P synergic stereoselectivity, for designing sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) catalysts. As a proof of concept, a RuP2 -configuration molecular catalyst was exploited to assemble an interlayer in Li-S batteries that adsorbs LiPSs, optimizes Li+ migration paths, and catalyzes SRRs. Comprehensive investigation identified the elimination of steric hindrance and strong electron orbital couplings between metallic d band and nonmetallic p band as the main contributing factors of PEC for the SRRs. As a result, the Li-S battery with similar to 0.5 wt % catalyst additive showed enhanced cycling stability even under a high sulfur loading (6.5 mg cm(-2)) and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (9 mu L mg(-1)).

The commercialization of Li-S battery is hindered by poor cycling efficiency. Herein, SiO2 nanotubes (SNTs) were prepared through the template method with ammonium DL-tartrate template. And multifunctional interlayer (SNTs@CP) composed of the SNTs and the carbon nanotube paper (CP) was fabricated to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect in Li-S batteries. The SNTs@CP interlayer could efficiently absorb polysulfides (LiPSs) through the polarization sites of SiO2. Moreover, conductive network can be formed by CP to enhance the rate capability and cycling performance. And the mesoporous hollow structure of the SNTs can facilitate the diffusion of Li ions. Results show that Li-S batteries with the SNTs@CP interlayer retain high specific capacity of 911 mA h/g after 80 cycles at 0.5 C, with the coulombic efficiency of 98%. Our work provides a promising new strategy to build high energy density Li-S battery. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A slight excess of GO is employed to create a second layer of graphene wrapping around the KBC/S. This g-KBC/S sulfur cathode exhibits excellent cyclability over 200 cycles where the average stabilized fade rate is only 0.026% or 1.1 mAh g(-1) per cycle. This excellent performance is primarily attributed to the wrapped, internally porous architecture. The large pore volume, small pore diameter, and uniform nanoparticle size of the mesoporous KBC array provides an ideal frame for the fabrication of a homogeneous C/S composite, whereas the graphene/GO sheets serve as an external chemical and physical barrier that inhibits polysulfide diffusion.

However, the insulation of charge and discharge products (sulfur and lithium sulfide) and the shuttle efforts of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), result in not only a series of phase conversion but also sluggish redox kinetics in Li-S electrochemistry. Herein, we firstly designed a flexible carbon cloth/molybdenum selenide (CC/MoSe2) by growing ultra-thin MoSe2 nanosheets on CC as binder-free electrode to understand the regulation mechanism in Li-S battery. With systematic electrochemical investigation of in-situ deposition Li2S8 in CC/MoSe2, it is found that CC/MoSe2 exhibits high LiPSs chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic activity, which large enhances the LiPSs conversion. The dynamic regulation of LiPSs change the nucleation and growth of Li2S, resulting in high uniform distribution on CC/MoSe2 electrode. Thus, it obtains high sulfur redox kinetics and utilization, which achieves initial capacity of 1142 mAh g(-1) with low capacity fade of only 0.038 % per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C. Even at high S loading (4 mg cm(-2)) and extremely low electrolyte/S (E/S) ratio of 6.2 mu L mg(-1), it still delivers 1204 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C with 93.3% capacity maintain.

Functionalizing the separator provides a straightforward approach to address these issues. Herein, we demonstrate a multifunctional MIL-125(Ti)-modified polypropylene/polyethylene separator for advanced Li-S batteries. The MIL-125(Ti), a Ti-containing metal-organic framework (MOF), features an open-skeleton construction, a high intrinsic microporosity and a Lewis acid characteristic. Compared with pristine separator, that with MIL-125(Ti) coating shows better electrolyte wettability and less resistance. The unique coating layer acts as an effective physical and chemical barrier region to capture polysulfide species without affecting the smooth transport of Lit. Meanwhile, the highly ordered micropores with a diameter of similar to 1.5 nm in the MOFs guide in a homogeneous Li+ plating and thereby inhibit lithium dendrites. Consequently, the MOF-modified separator enables a significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of the Li-S battery. The capacity retention of over 60% at 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) upon 200 cycles and a specific capacity of 612 mAh g(-1) at 2 C is realized. The facile approach offers an effective pathway toward high-performance Li-S batteries.

They are promising candidates for the electric vehicles. However, the severe shuttle effect of the soluble polysulfide inhibits the application of the lithium-sulfur battery. Therefore, hollow TiO2 spheres (HTOS) are synthesized and used as host materials for the element sulfur. For the as-prepared S@TiO2 (S@HTOS) composites, the presence of TiO2 could not only restrain the shuttle effect of the polysulfide, but also the hollow sphere structure is beneficial of the structural stability. As a result, the as-prepared S@HTOS composite electrode shows high initial specific capacity and superior cycle stability.

Since the pores in carbon materials play a critical role in the infusion of sulfur, access of the electrolyte, and the passage of lithium polysulfides (LPSs), the creation and tuning of hierarchical pore structures is strongly required to improve the electrochemical properties of sulfur/porous carbon composites, but remains a major challenge. Herein, a "brain-coral-like" mesoporous hollow carbon nanostructure consisting of an in situ-grown N-doped graphitic carbon nanoshell (NGCNs) matrix and embedded CoS2 nanoparticles as an efficient sulfur host is presented. The rational synthetic design based on metal-organic framework chemistry furnishes unusual multiple porosity in a carbon scaffold with a macrohollow in the core and microhollows and mesopores in the shell, without the use of any surfactant or template. The CoS2@NGCNs/S composite electrode facilitates high sulfur loading (75 wt%), strong adsorption of LPSs, efficient reaction kinetics, and stable cycle performance (903 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C after 100 cycles), derived from the synergetic effects of the dual hollow features, chemically active CoS2, and the conductive and mesoporous N-doped carbon matrix.

In this study, a novel 3D hierarchical carbon material (MCCNT) composed of mesoporous carbon sphere core and nitrogen rich CNTs shell is successfully prepared via an aerosol spray and subsequent chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. Owning to its well defined porous structure and favorable conductive framework, MCCNT is used as a potential sulfur host in lithium sulfur batteries through a classic melt-diffusion method. When cycled at a current density of 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mA h g(-1)), it delivers an initial capacity as high as 1438.7 mAh g(-1). Even if the current density increase to 1 C, the specific capacity still remain up to 534.6 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the hybrid structure of MCCNT, in which, the porous core works as a host to confine sulfur and accommodate volume expansion and the external CNTs provide excellent electron and ion conductive frame work. Furthermore, the in-situ doped nitrogen on the surface of CNTs enables effective trapping of lithium polysulfides, leading to a much-improved cycling performance. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is found that GF membrane has a highly porous structure with superior thermal stability, resulting in high liquid electrolyte uptake and enhanced electrochemical performance. Li-S cells using GF membrane as the separator can retain a capacity of 617 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C, which is 42% higher than that of cells using commercial microporous polypropylene separator. During rate capability tests, the capacity of Li-S cells using GF membrane decreases slowly from the reversible capacity of 616 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C to 505, 394 and 262 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C,1 C, and 2 C, respectively. It should be noted that these cells can still deliver a high capacity of 587 mA h g(-1) with a high retention of 95% when the current density is lowered back to 0.2 C. The improved cycling and rate performance are ascribed to the fact that the highly porous GF membrane can increase the intake of soluble polysulfide intermediates and slow down their rapid diffusion to the Li anode side, which can not only improve the utilization of active material, but help protect the Li anode surface as well.

However, their practical application is severely impeded by the notorious shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides. Herein, a nature polymer of konjac glucomannan (KGM) was adopted as polysulfide-adsorbing agent by coating on carbon nanofiber (CNF) mats for polysulfide-trapping interlayers in Li-S batteries. A uniform coating method was developed by improving the wettability of CNEs to aqueous solutions using ethanol as a co-solvent of water. It is revealed that not only the KGM polymer itself but also the coating quality is critical to prevent polysulfide diffusion. With the improved coating quality and the strong chemisorption of KGM, the shuttle effect was effectively suppressed and excellent electrochemical performance was demonstrated with a high reversible capacity of 1286 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 84% after 400 cycles at 1C and high rate capability. Our findings provide a facile way to address the shuttle behavior of Li-S batteries using low-cost and environmental friendly materials, which are very promising for large-scale energy storage applications.

However, its catalytic activity and chemical adsorption is not strong enough to suppress the shuttle effect of Lithium polysulfides (LiPS) under high sulfur loading. Herein, Phosphorous (P)-doped Co9S8 nanoparticle was synthesized and embedded into 3D Spongy carbon (SC) sheets as electrochemical catalyst for LSBs. Our Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results revealed that moderate P doping can modulate the electronic structure of Co9S8 and simultaneously improve its interaction with LiPS and promote LiPS conversion. When P-doped Co9S8 nanoparticles are in situ formed and homogeneously distributed on 3D spongy carbon sheet matrix, the resulting P-Co9S8@SC can ensure good exposure of their adsorption and catalytic sites. As a result, the LSB based on an optimized P-Co9S8@SC modified polypropylene separator exhibited excellent cycling stability (capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle over 900 cycles at 1 C) and high areal capacity (4.38 mAh cm(-2) at 5.6 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading at 0.1 C). Our work demonstrates that moderate heteroatom doping is a promising strategy to develop effective polysulfides catalysis.

Herein, a hierarchical high-porosity graphene oxide-porous carbon/sulfur (GO-PC/S) composite cathode is designed and fabricated. In this work, sodium chloride was used as temporary space holders to create a hierarchical porous structure for accelerating the transmission of Li+, accommodating the volumetric expansion, and enlarging the specific surface area (342.623m(2)g(-1)) up to eight times. Owing to the abundant oxygen-containing functional groups of GO, sulfur and polysulfides can be effectively immobilized and the conductivity is enhanced by porous carbon. The Li-S battery exhibits outstanding kinetic performance and rate capability (618.3mAhg(-1) at 2C) as well as excellent cycling performance over 300 cycles.

ZnFe2O4 hollow rods enabling accelerated polysulfide conversion for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Metal oxides; Polysulfide conversion; Accelerated kinetics; Reaction activation energies	PERFORMANCE; NANOPARTICLES; CATHODE; ELECTROCATALYSIS; LI2S	The high energy density and favorable cost-effectiveness make lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries one of the most attractive energy storage systems. However, the low sulfur utilization and poor cycle life, resulting from the losses of soluble polysulfide intermediates, and their sluggish redox conversion process, severely impede practical applications of reliable Li-S batteries. Effectively inhibiting the polysulfide diffusion and accelerating their conversion is beneficial to enhance the performance of sulfur cathodes. Herein, a novel carbon-free ZnFe2O4 hollow rod has been developed as an advanced host material to confine polysulfides within the cathode and accelerate the redox conversion during cycling. The soluble polysulfides anchored by the ZnFe2O4 hollow rod structure are shown to be rapidly converted to sulfur and lithium sulfides. Detrimental polysulfide diffusion is therefore effectively inhibited. The redox kinetics of sulfur cathodes has been systematically investigated, revealing that the ZnFe2O4 host can improve the activity for Li2S deposition, facilitate lithium-ion diffusion, and lower the reaction energy barriers for the multistep phase transition of sulfur. As a result, the developed S@ZnFe2O4 composite cathodes exhibit an improved cycling capacity of 1158 mAh g-1. These results demonstrate that the accelerated redox conversion of anchored polysulfides is essential for enhancing the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

In this study, a GNS/sulfur (GNS/S) composite was prepared using the infiltration method with organic solvent. The structure, morphology and crystallinity of the composites were examined using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical properties were also characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV data revealed that the GNS/S composites exhibited enhanced specific-current density and similar to 10% higher capacity, in comparison with the S-containing, activated-carbon samples. The composite electrode also showed better cycling performance for multiple charge/discharge cycles. The improvement in the capacity and cycling stability of the GNS/S composite electrode is probably related to the fact that the graphene in the composite improves conductivity and that the graphene is well dispersed in the composites.

The carbon cloth substrate is flexible together with the conductive bottlebrush-like Mo2C, this host material can provide more active sites and a large inner space to accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur to Li2S2/Li2S. The electric conductive Mo2C nanoarrays can not only adsorb the polysulfides through forming Mo-S bonds to inhibit the shuttle of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also can boost the electron transfer and promote the direct conversion of the LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S on their surface. As a result, the sulfur cathodes based on the Mo2C/CC host material exhibit an impressive specific capacity of 1213 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, maintain a long-term cyclability with a decay of 0.011% per cycle. More remarkably, excellent capacity of 8.57 mA h cm(-2) can be attained with a high sulfur loading (10.8 mg cm(-2)) benefit from the 3D nanoarrays structure of the Mo2C/CC host material. Meanwhile, a pouch cell based on Mo2C/CC@S cathode can cycle steadily.

In order to suppress availably the shuttle effect of LiPSs, herein a holistic design strategy for using tin disulfide nanosheet wrapped with interconnected carbon nanotube networks (SnS2@CNT) as the sulfur host and separator of LSBs is put forward. Based on the advantages of physical internment and chemistry absorption for LiPSs as well fast electron/lithium ion transport of SnS2@CNT, the LSBs with SnS2@CNT/S-SnS2@CNT release a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1375 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C. After 800 cycles a high reversible specific capacity of 555 mAh g(-1) can still be obtained even at a high current density of 2C. Besides, the LSBs with the high sulfur loading of 4.8 mg cm(-2) can exhibit a reversible areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm(-2) after 50 cycles. Therefore, the design strategy provides a beneficial exploration for the commercialization of high-performance LSBs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To address the aforementioned issues, a vesicle-like sulfur/reduced graphene oxides composite cathode with a high sulfur content of 76 wt% has been synthesized. For the composite, graphene sheets derived vesicle shells can improve the conductivity to facilitate fast electron transfer in cathode. Meanwhile, the unique vesicle structure can not only suppress the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte but also mitigate the volumetric variation of polysulfide species during cycling. On the basis of these merits, the composite delivers superior electrochemical performances. A relatively stable capacity of over 600 mAh g(-1) is remained during 150 cycles at 2 C. Even with 300 cycles, it still shows an extremely low decay of approximately 0.12% per cycle. Our work provides a strategy for the preparation of a kind of sulfur@graphene material that holds a great potential for high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Melt impregnation (M-CNTA/S and M-CNTS/S) and solution penetration (S-CNTA/S and S-CNTS/S) methods are separately carried out to introduce sulfur into two carbon nanotube-based matrix. Besides, random distributed carbon nanotube powders (RCNT)-based cathode made through a slurry coating process is also prepared for comparison. As a result, the aligned CNTA skeleton has the most efficient transfer paths and regular nanometer-sized gaps, which greatly benefit the directional transmission of electrons, better rate performance, smaller cell resistance and long cyclic stability. Especially, the cell made by M-CNTA/S delivers an outstanding high-rate performance of 3 C -859.3 mAh g(-1), 5 C -833.1 mAh g(-1)and 10 C -702.8 mAh g(-1), with a capacity retention of 77 % and coulombic effciency (similar to 100 %) after 200 cycles at a rate of 3 C. Meanwhile, the interconnected CNTS has a larger pore diameter and 3D conductive network, which benefits higher sulfur loading and electrochemical activity of sulfur. In particular, the M-CNTS/S with a sulfur content up to 60 wt %, achieves an impressive multiplier performance of 0.5 C 1285 mAh g(-1), 1 C 1030 mAh g(-1)and 3 C 900 mAh g(-1). The retention of the capacity reaches around 88 % after 100 charge-discharge cycles at 3 C. The current observation reveals the crucial effects from the spatial structure and sulfur impregnation method on the performance of carbon nanotube/sulfur (C/S)-based cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries, which serves as important guidance for the development of high-performance cathode materials.

The resulting samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). MoO2-CNFs with an average diameter of 425-575 nm obtained after heat treatment were used as a matrix to prepare sulfur/MoO2-CNF cathodes for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The polysulfide adsorption and electrochemical performance tests demonstrated that MoO2-CNFs did not only act as polysulfide reservoirs to alleviate the shuttle effect, but also improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics during the charge-discharge processes. The effect of MoO2-CNF heat treatment on the cycle performance of sulfur/MoO2-CNFs electrodes was examined, and the data showed that MoO2-CNFs calcined at 850 degrees C delivered optimal performance with an initial capacity of 1095 mAh g(-1) and 860 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. The results demonstrated that sulfur/MoO2-CNF composites display a remarkably high lithium-ion diffusion coefficient, low interfacial resistance and much better electrochemical performance than pristine sulfur cathodes.

However, the poor electronic conductivity and "shuttle effect" as well as large volume change during charge and discharge process of sulfur-based cathodes hinder their further practical applications. Here, LiFePO4 (LFP) hollow microspheres are compounded with holey graphene (HG) through an electrostatic attraction strategy coupled with high temperature treatment, and denoted as HG/LFP binary host, in which, LFP microspheres with relatively high redox potential play the key roles for chemically adsorption of soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs) and facilitating the transition process between long-chain LiPSs and short-chain Li2S2/Li2S, and thus effectively suppressing the "shuttle effect" during charge and discharge process. Moreover, the HG component could guarantee a good electronic conductivity and fast mass transport of the sulfur cathode, which further improves the kinetic process for electrochemical reactions. Therefore, HG/LFP/S cathode composite exhibits high specific capacity, outstanding rate performance and cycling stability under large sulfur loading condition (4.3 and 8.4 mg cm(-2)), which presents a great potential for practical application in LSBs cathodes.

However, existing drawbacks including the shuttling of intermediate polysulfides, the insulating nature of sulfur, and the considerable volume change of sulfur cathode would otherwise result in the capacity fading and unstable cycling. To overcome these challenges, herein an in situ assembly route is presented to fabricate VS2/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (G-VS2) as a sulfur host. Benefiting from the 2D conductive and polar VS2 interlayered within a graphene framework, the obtained G-VS2 hybrids can effectively suppress the polysulfide shuttling, facilitate the charge transport, and cushion the volume expansion throughout the synergistic effect of structural confinement and chemical anchoring. With these advantageous features, the obtained sulfur cathode (G-VS2/S) can deliver an outstanding rate capability (approximate to 950 and 800mAh g(-1) at 1 and 2C, respectively) and an impressive cycling stability at high rates (retaining approximate to 532mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 5C). More significantly, it enables superior cycling performance of high-sulfur-loading cathodes (achieving an areal capacity of 5.1mAh cm(-2) at 0.2C with a sulfur loading of 5mg cm(-2)) even at high current densities.

J	Huang, BB; Jin, LN; Qian, XY; Chen, JY; Cheng, J; Wang, YH				Huang, Bingbing; Jin, Lina; Qian, Xinye; Chen, Jianyu; Cheng, Jian; Wang, Yuhe			Preparation of carbon nanotubes-hollow Co9S8 composite and its use in separator modification for lithium-sulfur battery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						CNTs; lithium polysulfides; lithium sulfur battery; modified separator	LI-S BATTERIES; POLYSULFIDES	Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have received numerous studies because of their advantages of high specific capacity, low cost of the sulfur element and so on. However, there are several obstacles restricting the commercial use of LSBs, including low conductance of sulfur, volume expansion effect of the positive sulfur electrode and serious shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides. In this work, a composite of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and hollow Co9S8 (CNTs/Co9S8) is synthesized via ZIF-67 as a template and is applied on the surface of the PE separator for LSBs. Benefited from the excellent conductance of CNTs as well as the adsorption and catalysis properties of polar hollow Co9S8, the cell with the CNTs/Co9S8 composite functional separator delivered the discharge capacity of 977.6 and remained 456 mAh g(-1) after 500 loops at a current density of 0.5 C, corresponding to a low attenuation rate of only 0.1% per cycle, as well as excellent rate properties. Even at high areal mass loading of active sulfur, LSBs exhibited excellent long-term cycling stability at various current rates. In addition, the Li dendrites were remarkably restrained, which further enhanced the safety of batteries. This paper provides an effective and newfangled approach with modified separators coating composite materials of carbon species and structural sulfide to inhibit the shuttle of intermediate polysulfides and further enhance the utility of LSBs in the future.

However, the low sulfur utilization and short cycle life extremely hinder their application. Herein, we design and fabricate a three-dimensional electrode by a simple filtration method to achieve a high-sulfur loading. Biomass porous carbon is employed as a current collector, which not only enhances the electronic transport but also effectively limits the volume expansion of the active material. Meanwhile, an optimized carboxymethyl cellulose binder is chosen. The chemical bonding restricts the shuttle effect, leading to improved electrochemical performance. Under the ultrahigh sulfur load of 28mg/cm(2), the high capacity of 18mAh/cm(2) is still maintained, and stable cycling performance is obtained. This study demonstrates a viable strategy to develop promising lithium-sulfur batteries with a three-dimensional electrode, which promotes sulfur loading and electrochemical performance.

The enhanced stability of electrolyte/anode interface and improved electrochemical performances (cycling, rate and self-discharging) of the Li/S cell are presented by using ETFE-containing electrolyte, especially for complete replacement of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) by ETFE in combine with 1,3-dioxolane (DOL). It is found that ETFE plays a key role in modifying the surface composition and structure of the metallic Li, forming a strengthened protective film on the anode during cycling. Besides, ETFE is considered to decrease the dissolution of polysulfides in the electrolyte. These factors together restrict the contact and reaction between polysulfides and Li anode.

In this work, a kind of unique gamma-Al2O3@C yolk-shell microspheres comprising carbon coating on the gamma-Al2O3 yolk-shell microspheres were synthesized using organic adsorpting and in-situ thermal reduction methods, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was demonstrated that the gamma-Al2O3@C yolk-shell microspheres could encapsulate the polysulfides and increase the sulfur utilization. Accordingly, gamma-Al2O3@C yolk-shell microspheres cathode achieved high initial discharge capacity of 1046.9 mAh g(-1), excellent discharge capacity (765.5 mAh g(-1)) after 70 cycles (the capacity retention was about 73%) and superior rate performance. In addition, the appropriate C content was proved to be an important factor in the influence of electrochemical performances. Hence, our present method paves a new path to improve the performance of Li-S batteries.

Resolving these deficiencies is the most direct route toward achieving practical cells of this chemistry. Herein, a vertically aligned wood-derived carbon plate decorated with Co4N nanoparticles host (Co4N/WCP) is proposed that can serve as a host for both the sulfur cathode and the metallic lithium anode. This Co4N/WCP electrode host drastically enhances the reaction kinetics in the sulfur cathode and homogenizes the electric field at the anode for the uniform lithium plating. Density functional theory calculations confirm the experimental observations that Co4N/WCP provides a lower energy barrier for the polysulfide redox reaction in the cathode and a low adsorption energy for lithium deposition at the anode. Employing the Co4N/WCP host at both electrodes in a S@Co4N/WCP||Li@Co4N/WCP full cell delivers a specific capacity of 807.9 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at a 1 C rate. Additional experiments are performed with high areal sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2) to demonstrate the viability of this strategy for producing practical Li-S cells.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish redox conversion result in inefficient sulfur utilization, low power density, and rapid electrode deterioration. Herein, these challenges are addressed with two strategies 1) increasing LiPS conversion kinetics through catalysis, and 2) alleviating the shuttle effect by enhanced trapping and adsorption of LiPSs. These improvements are achieved by constructing double-shelled hollow nanocages decorated with a cobalt nitride catalyst. The N-doped hollow inner carbon shell not only serves as a physiochemical absorber for LiPSs, but also improves the electrical conductivity of the electrode; significantly suppressing shuttle effect. Cobalt nitride (Co4N) nanoparticles, embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon in the outer shell, catalyze the conversion of LiPSs, leading to decreased polarization and fast kinetics during cycling. Theoretical study of the Li intercalation energetics confirms the improved catalytic activity of the Co4N compared to metallic Co catalyst. Altogether, the electrode shows large reversible capacity (1242 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), robust stability (capacity retention of 658 mAh g(-1) at 5 C after 400 cycles), and superior cycling stability at high sulfur loading (4.5 mg cm(-2)).

However, Li-S batteries suffer from poor practical energy density due to serious polysulfide dissolution and shuttle, as well as lithium anode corrosion. Herein, we provide a dual-protection strategy for the high-energy density Li-S cell by inserting two nanotube paper (CNTp) interlayers on both electrodes. The CNTp interlayers can provide stable interfaces for both the cathode and anode, facilitating the formation of uniform charge transfer and ion flue. As a result, the Li-S cell exhibits stable cycling performance and great rate ability up to a high rate of 5 C (5 C = 25 mA cm(-2)). Even at an ultrahigh sulfur load of 12.1 mg cm(-2), a high areal capacity of 12.6 mAh cm(-2) is still achieved, which can remain at 11.1 mAh cm(-2) after 30 cycles (corresponding to 917 mAh g(-1)). The refined interfaces between the electrolyte and both electrodes are further confirmed by the micro-zone current distribution and COMSOL simulation. Our approach provides an effective and universal strategy to improve the electrochemical stability of the Li-S cell at high sulfur load, opening a new platform for designing advanced metal cell systems.

Carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported MoSe2 nanoflakes with a large interlayer spacing were coated on a commercial polypropylene separator to build an efficient barrier (M/C-PP) to polysulfide shuttling for Li-S batteries. The battery with the separator had initial specific capacities of 1 485 and 880 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 2 C, respectively, and an excellent long-term cycling stability with a low decay rate of 0.093% per cycle at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. This excellent performance was attributed to the strong adsorption of polysulfides by MoSe2 and the fast charge transport channels provided by the CNTs.

This feature is highly desirable in rechargeable lithium batteries because the electrochemical performances of some electrodes, such as sulfur cathodes, are greatly weakened by the dissolution of active material related anions into the electrolyte and the slow transport of lithium ions. Here, inspired by nature, a polymer membrane with negatively-charged nanochannels is applied to a sulfur-carbon cathode to overcome the poor cycling stability and rate capability of the lithium-sulfur battery. The polymer membrane possesses negatively charged nanochannels with a width dimension (ca. 2 nm) comparable to the Debye length, therefore is capable of regulating the ion transport by facilitating the transport of lithium ions and rejecting the migration of polysulfide anions. At 0.2 C and 1 C, the specific capacities keep at high levels of 1105 and 838 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles, respectively. Furthermore, at a high rate of 18 C, a high specific capacity of 612 mA h g(-1) is retained over 250 cycles, with a high capacity retention of 91%.

The use of BCSs with hydrophilic nature as a framework could provide large interface areas between the active materials and electrolyte, and improve the dispersion of T-PPy, which could help in the active material utilization. As a result, BCS@T-PPy/S as a cathode material exhibited a high capacity of 1143.6 mA h g(-1) and delivered a stable capacity up to 685.8 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 C, demonstrating its promising application for rechargeable Li-S batteries.

J	Ye, H; Yin, YX; Guo, YG				Ye, Huan; Yin, Ya-Xia; Guo, Yu-Guo			Insight into the loading temperature of sulfur on sulfur/carbon cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Li-S batteries; sulfur-carbon composite; microporous carbon; nanospheres; electrochemical properties	CARBON; GRAPHENE; CAPACITY; ANODES	Lithium-sulfur batteries are highly desired because of their characteristics such as high energy density. However, the applications of Li-S batteries are limited because they exist dissolution of polysulfides into electrolytes. This study reports the preparation of sulfur cathodes by using bimodal microporous (0.5 nm and 0.8 nm to 2.0 nm) carbon spheres with high specific area (1992 m(2) g(-1)) and large micropore volume (1.2 g cm(-1)), as well as the encapsulation of polysulfides via formation of carbon-sulfur bonds in a sealed vacuum glass tube at high temperature. Given that sulfur and polysulfides are well confined by the S-C bond, the shuttle effect is effectively suppressed. The prepared S/C cathodes with a sulfur loading of up to 75% demonstrate high sulfur activity with reversible capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 A g(-1) and good cycling stability (667 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles).

The unique porous structure not only effectively minimized the diffusion of soluble polysulfides generating shuttle effect but also substantially buffered the huge volume expansion of sulfur during cycling as well as improving conductivity. C/S composited with HMC activated at 800 degrees C delivered a high specific discharge capacity of 870 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and 69% of it was still kept after 100 cycles. At a higher current rate of 2 C, a high discharge capacity of 569.2 mAh g(-1) corresponding to 85% of initial capacity was achieved, exhibiting excellent rate capability and capacity retention.

Herein, a porous CNTs/Co microsphere is synthesized and applied as sulfur host material to boost the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode. The porous conductive CNTs spherical network can realize a rapid charge and mass transfer via fast conduction of Li+-ions and mitigate the cathode volume expansion in the course of the cycles. Importantly, the Co metal nanoparticles can attain intense chemical adsorption and fast catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Because of the above merits, the high initial discharge specific capacity 1242.5 mAh g(-1) was obtained for S-CNTs/Co composite at 0.2C. The capacity decay rate was only 0.066% per cycle at 1C over 300 cycles and the excellent rate performance at up to 3C could also be obtained. Moreover, the S-CNTs/Co composite delivered a high initial areal capacity of 5.7 mAh cm(-2) at a high sulfur loading (5.9 mg cm(-2)), indicating broad perspectives of CNTs/Co as a sulfur host in lithium-sulfur battery.

However, its commercialization on large scale is thwarted by fast capacity fading caused by the Achilles' heel of Li-S systems: the polysulfide shuttle. Here, we merge the physical features of carbon-coated separators and the unique chemical properties of N and S codoped mesoporous carbon to create a functional hybrid separator with superior polysulfide affinity and electrochemical benefits. DFT calculations revealed that carbon materials with N and S codoping possess a strong binding energy to high-order polysulfide species, which is essential to keep the active material in the cathode side. As a result of the synergistic effect of N, S dual-doping, an advanced Li-S cell with high specific capacity and ultralow capacity degradation of 0.041% per cycle is achieved. Pushing our simple-designed and scalable cathode to a highly increased sulfur loading of 5.4 mg cm(-2), the Li-S cell with the functional hybrid separator can deliver a remarkable areal capacity of 5.9 mAh cm(-2), which is highly favorable for practical applications.

Herein, we report a durable high-power cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries by employing multifunctional hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (hNCNC) to encapsulate sulfur and serve as interlayer. The highly-efficient electrocatalytic function of nitrogen-doped sp(2)-carbon to lithium-polysulfides conversion reactions is revealed by electrocatalytic experiments and density functional theory simulations. The excellent catalytic and charge-transfer functions of hNCNC, together with its physical confinement and chemical adsorption to the polysulfides, effectively suppress the polarization and shuttle effects, leading to the high-power performance with a capacity of 539 mAh g(-1) at ultrahigh current density of 20 A g(-1) for the sulfur cathode with the areal loading of 0.8 mg cm(-2). The superb durability is demonstrated by 1000 cycles at 10 A g(-1) with a retained capacity of 438 mAh g(-1). When the areal sulfur loading is increased to 3 mg cm(-2), a high capacity of 605 mAh g(-1) is still obtained at the high current density of 3 A g(-1). This study provides an effective approach to durable high-power lithium-sulfur batteries by designing suitable electrocatalytic-active carbon-based hosts.

However, the low electrical conductivity of S and the dissolution of polysulfides in organic electrolytes pose significant challenges for their industrial applications. Herein, we report a facile, scalable, and solvent-free synthetic method based on metal-organic-framework (MOF) for synthesizing N-doped carbon-based materials with hierarchical porous structures and large specific surface areas (2297 m2 g-1) as efficient cathode hosts for Li-S batteries. The cathode materials were synthesized via solvent-free mixing, followed by the direct carbonization of adenine and tetracarboxylic acid with zinc acetate using the molten salt method. Zinc salt was employed as a template for mesopores as well as binding sites for other organic materials. The irregular surface morphology and N-doping of the resulting porous carbons act as physical barriers to confine polysulfides within the carbon matrix. The Sloaded cathode was stable and exhibited a discharge capacity of 555 mAh g-1 over 290 cycles at a current density of 0.5C, corresponding to the capacity retention of 63%. The facile modified MOF synthetic strategy, assisted by molten salt processing, holds promise for the synthesis of noble cathode materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

In this study, a sheet nitrogen-doped vanadium dioxide material that roots in a metal-organic framework (SVO) was designed and synthesized. SVO has a unique twodimensional structure and uniform distribution of metal sites. It leads to the adsorption-catalytic synergistic effect that can efficiently anchor polysulfides and promote sulfur conversion kinetics to significantly alleviate the shuttle effect. With the metal-organic framework precursor synthesized under mild conditions of room temperature and pressure, the SVO materials used to modify the separator can be simply obtained by calcination. Especially, the modified material exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with only 0.081% degradation of capacity per cycle at 1C after 500 cycles. Even under a harsh condition (sulfur loading = 6.3 mg cm-2, E/S = 5), the battery with SVO/AB separator is available to reach an area capacity of about 4.16 mAh cm-2 at 0.1C. Meantime, as for the anode side, SVO/AB separator can be used as lithium-ion guides to keep stable lithium-ion stripping/plating and inhibit the growth of lithium dendrite. The battery with SVO/AB separator also shows superior performance under high and low temperatures.

The 5-second procedure melts sulfur into carbon nanofiber mats, which play a significant role as a built-in conductive matrix to provide uninterrupted electron transport pathways throughout the electrode such that the heavy current collector is eliminated. Meanwhile, the large inter-fiber spacing facilitates electrolyte diffusion and provides sufficient space for sulfur integration during cathode fabrication and the volume expansion during lithium-sulfur redox reaction. This technique eliminates the need for slurry processing with insulating binders and toxic solvents while eliminating heavy current collectors. This ultra-rapid technique involving only 140 degrees C, 5 s, and slight pressure (<250 psi) offers a practical approach to light-weight sulfur cathodes compared to the conventional sulfur melt deposition techniques requiring high temperatures (155-300 degrees C), long times (8-10 h), and heavy components in the cell assembly. The cathodes thus obtained deliver a discharge capacity of similar to 550 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) owing to their simple construction, with 100% capacity retention at 0.5C rate over 150 cycles. This translates to similar to 250 mA h g(electrode)(-1) (based on total mass at the cathode) which is comparable to highly sophisticated electrodes when the weight of the entire electrode and current collector is considered.

In this composite, the cross-linked aminated carbon nanotubes framework provides a fast charge transport pathway and enhancement in the reaction kinetics of the active material to greatly improve the rate capability and sulfur utilization. The ethylenediamine moieties provide strong adhesion of polar discharge products to nonpolar carbon surfaces and thus efficiently prevent polysulfide dissolution to improve the cycle stability, confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The outside polyaniline layers structurally restrain polysulfides to prevent the shuttle effect and active material loss. Benefiting from these advantages, the synthesized composite exhibits a high initial capacity of 1215 mAh g(-1) and a capacity of 975 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Even after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, a capacity of 735 mAh g(-1) can be maintained, among the best performance reported. The strategy in this work can shed some light on modifying nonpolar carbon surfaces via the amination process to chemically attach sulfur species for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

As the cathode of lithium-sulfur battery, the nanocomposites exhibit high capacity and cyclability. The reversible capacity is up to 900 mAh g (1) after 80 cycles at 0.2 C rate. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to that the diffusion of lithium polysulfide can be greatly inhibited by the loading of SnO2 nanoparticles. The metallic Mo particles embedded in the system can increase the conductance of the composites. The present results indicate that hierarchical MoS2-based nanocomposites are good candidates for the cathode of lithium-sulfur battery. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By applying the composite as the cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, it demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performances including a high reversible capacity (1315 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), excellent rate capability (724 and 496 mAh g(-1) at 2 and 5 C rates, respectively) and superior cycling stability (528 and 367 mAh g(-1) at 2 and 5C after 500 cycles, respectively). The synergetic effect of the mesoporous carbon matrix, uniform sized CoFe nanoparticles and N heteroatoms simultaneously contributes to the confinement of sulfur species. The presence of abundant mesopores and micropores can physically confine sulfur species. The formed CoFe-N-x moieties can not only improve the electronic conductivity of the as-prepared composites, but also offer highly effective active sites for chemical absorption and catalytic transformation of polysulfides to suppress any shuttle effect. In addition, the mesoporous structure can effectively alleviate the volume changes resulted from charge-discharge process. The strategy developed in this work proposes an alternative way to obtain N-doped mesoporous carbon matrix modified with CoFe nanoparticles for high performance cathode materials of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, well-dispersed single atom Zn-decorated hollow carbon spheres (Zn-1-HNC) are developed as dual-functional nanoreactors for polysulfides-suppressed sulfur cathodes (Zn-1-HNC-S) and dendrite-free lithium anodes (Zn-1-HNC-Li) simultaneously for high-capacity, high-rate, and long-cycling Li-S batteries with fast redox kinetics. Benefiting from its excellent electronic conductivity, high surface area (370 m(2)g(-1)), highly-effective active sites and protective carbon shell, the resultant nanoreactor possesses strong physical confinement, chemical anchoring, and exceptional electrocatalysis for polysulfides. Meanwhile, the nanoreactor with excellent lithiophilic ability realizes uniform and dendrite-free lithium deposition. Integrating all these advantages, the assembled full battery (Zn-1-HNC-S||Zn-1-HNC-Li) delivers remarkable electrochemical properties including long cycle stability with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.015% per cycle over 700 cycles and superb rate performance of 989 mAh g(-1)at 10 C. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 8.7 mAh cm(-2)with high S loading of 7.8 mg cm(-2)at low E/S ratio (6.4 mu L mg(-1)) is achieved. This work provides significant insight of structure and surface catalytic chemistry regulation for promoting the actual application of Li-S batteries.

Guided by theoretical calculations, a multifunctional catalyst of isolated single-atom nickel in an optimal Ni-N-5 active moiety incorporated in hollow nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Ni-N-5/HNPC) is constructed and acts as an ideal host for a sulfur cathode. The host improved electrical conductivity, enhanced physical-chemical dual restricting capability toward LiPSs, and, more importantly, boosted the redox reaction kinetics by the Ni-N-5 active moiety. Therefore, the Ni-N-5/HNPC/S cathode exhibits superior rate performance, long-term cycling stability, and good areal capacity at high sulfur loading. This work highlights the important role of the coordination number of active centers in single-atom catalysts and provides a strategy to design a hollow nanoarchitecture with single-atom active sites for high-performance Li-S batteries.

In this study, original Fe3O4 nanospheres with diameters close to 12 nm were finely dispersed over a porous nitrogen-doped carbon matrix by the freeze-drying method to produce a three-dimensional composite material (nano-Fe3O4/PNC) suitable for application as a sulfur host in LSBs. Nano-Fe3O4/PNC loaded with sulfur (S@nano-Fe3O4/PNC) was used as a cathode in a Li-S cell, whose initial discharge specific capacity reached 1256 mA h g(-1) at a 0.1 C rate. After 100 charge-discharge cycles at a 0.2 C rate, the reversible capacity of S@nano-Fe3O4/PNC remained at 745 mA h g(-1), demonstrating a capacity retention rate of 70%. Importantly, a high Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% was achieved, indicating effective inhibition of the polysulfides' "shuttle effect" by nano-Fe3O4/PNC. The use of electrolytes containing lithium nitrate further reduces the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides. This study demonstrates the synergistic effect between metal oxide nanoparticles and N-doped carbon, which plays an important role in promoting the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides in LSBs.

To address the abovementioned issues, a strategy based on confined assembly of polyaniline (PANI) on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) drive by the 7C-7C electronic interaction is proposed to prepare MWNTs@PANI model. Benefit from the doping characteristic of PANI, various multifunctional dopants can be introduced to adjust the aggregation structure of PANI and construct a functionally improved model, and most importantly, the various functional groups of dopants provide an extra boost for suppression of the shuttle effect. Benefit from the unique microstructure and multi-functional groups, the cathode based on MWNTs@PANI model delivers the initial discharge capacity of 1309 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, and exhibits a stable capacity of 672 mAh g-1 even after cycling for 250 times at 1C. The assembled soft-packed cell shows an ultrastable open-circuit voltage at various bending states.

J	Garapati, MS; Sundara, R				Garapati, Meenakshi Seshadhri; Sundara, Ramaprabhu			Enhancing polysulfide confinement and redox kinetics by electrocatalytic interlayer for highly stable lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Iron carbide; Electrocatalytic interlayer; Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes; Lithium polysulfides; Lithium-sulfur batteries	DOPED CARBON NANOTUBES; ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; GRAPHENE; CATHODE; CONVERSION; NANOPARTICLES; SYNERGY; HYBRIDS; FE3C	Enhancing active material utilization and restricting lithium polysulfide (LPS) shuttle effect are the bottlenecks for developing stable and high-performance Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we present the in-situ nitrogen-doped bamboo/compartmental structured carbon nanotubes (BNT) without and with iron carbide nanoparticle encapsulation (Fe3C/BNT) as the sulfur host and electrocatalytic interlayer for Li-S batteries. The compartmental/bamboo structured BNT has a high specific surface area which helps in facilitating the transport of electrons/Li+ ions and also provides the interspace for sulfur volume expansion during the sulfur redox reactions. The symmetric cell studies show that the presence of Fe3C in BNT accelerates LPS redox reactions for the formation of Li2S and vice-versa. The synergistic combination of BNT-S cathode with Fe3C/BNT interlayer delivers a specific capacity of 1235 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C-rate and cyclic stability for 500 cycles with 0.032% capacity fading rate, suggesting the strong chemical interaction and electrocatalytic activity of Fe3C/BNT towards intermediate LPS. The present study also investigates the superior catalytic activity of Fe3C/BNT interlayer and the interfacial sulfur redox kinetics during the charge and discharge processes by dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Therefore, this study demonstrates a new and efficient strategy for developing high-performance Li-S batteries by using low-cost cathode materials towards the catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides.

J	Zhang, XF; Chen, MS; Zhang, Q; Liu, JQ; Wu, YC				Zhang, Xiaofei; Chen, Mingsu; Zhang, Qi; Liu, Jiaqin; Wu, Yucheng			New insights into synergistic effects of La2O3 and nitrogen doped carbon for improved redox kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries: A computational study	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Lanthanum oxide; Nitrogen doped carbon; Synergistic effect; First-principles calculation	HIGH-PERFORMANCE LITHIUM; 1ST PRINCIPLES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; GRAPHENE; MECHANISM; CATHODES; PROGRESS	The La2O3/carbon/S composite electrode shows great performance in improving cycling stability and high-rate performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Although it has been proposed to be attributed to the synergistic effects of La2O3 and carbon material, the roles of La2O3 and carbon, and the specific manifestation of the synergy are still unclear. In the current study, the first-principles calculation was carried out to clarify these questions. The investigation reveals that only polysulfide migration and polysulfide dimer cleavage steps were carried out on the surface of La2O3. That is, only a part of rather than all of the catalytic steps occur on the surface of La2O3. By comparison, the nitrogen doped carbon, which are generally considered to have no catalytic effect, play an important role in the catalytic discharge process by realizing twice lithiation-lithium diffusion and providing a fast migration path for polysulfide dimers. Therefore, the synergistic effect is the joint participation of La2O3 and nitrogen doped carbon in the polysulfide catalytic conversion, rather than simple combination of the catalysis for La2O3 and conductivity for nitrogen doped carbon. It is hoped that the explanation of synergistic effect would help to promote the application of rare-earth oxides in high-rate long-life lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the rapid capacity fading of sulfur cathodes caused by the shuttling of polysulfide intermediates between the cathodes and anodes restricts the application of Li-S batteries. In this work, a facile wet-chemistry method is developed for the direct synthesis of few-molecular-layer thin metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets without using surfactant. By assembling these ultrathin MOF nanosheets with a facile vacuum filtration method, a highly oriented and flexible MOF membrane with favorable mechanical properties is achieved for the first time. The excellent features make the as-prepared MOF nanosheets ideal to fabricate lightweight interlayer modified separators for suppressing the polysulfide shuttling of Li-S batteries. When using the MOF membrane modified separator, the Li-S batteries made from commercial carbon materials exhibits the significantly enhanced cycling stabilities. This work brings new opportunities for the synthesis and application of MOF materials.

While the low utilization of sulfur and sluggish reaction kinetics would lead to degradation of electrochemical performance and thus hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a double-shelled TiO2-graphene heterostructure (H-TiO2/rGO) with abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) and highly exposed active plane as advanced host material in Li-S batteries is designed. This rational structure not only provides sufficient active sites and lower bandgap for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), but also builds smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs on catalyst, which greatly reduces interfacial energy barrier and promotes the utilization of sulfur through suppressing the devastating shuttling effect. Combining the synergetic merits of strong anchoring ability and catalyzing the of LiPSs, the electrode (S-TiO2/rGO-1) exhibits superior rate performance and long lifespan (1000 cycles at 1C, 0.023% capacity loss per cycle) with high columbic efficiency. This work paves an alternative way to establish smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of polysulfides on catalyst in Li-S batteries and provides a new sight to understand catalyst design in energy storage devices.

Herein, we fabricate an ion selective film of covalent organic framework (denoted as TpPa-SO3Li) onto the commercial Celgard separator. The aligned nanochannels and continuous negatively charged sites in the TpPa-SO3Li layer can effectively facilitate the lithium ion conduction and meanwhile significantly suppress the diffusion of polysulfides via the electrostatic interaction. Consequently, the TpPa-SO3Li layer exhibits excellent ion selectivity with an extremely high lithium ion transference number of 0.88. When using this novel functional layer, the Li-S batteries with a high sulfur loading of 5.4 mg cm(-2) can acquire a high initial capacity of 822.9 mA h g(-1) and high retention rate of 78% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides new insights into developing high-performance Li-S batteries via ion selective separator strategy.

In order to reduce the shuttle effect, multilayered polyelectrolyte complexes (CS/CNTs)(n) as surface modification agents were prepared by alternating deposition of oppositely charged hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH) and chitosan (CS) via the layer-by-layer method. The as-prepared fiber multilayered complex separator (FMCS) was finally treated by heating at 120 degrees C to form cross-linked network for better thermal stability. FMCS possessed much higher porosity than that of the commercial PP separator (44%). As expected, the assembled membranes remained intact even at 150 degrees C, while PP separator shrunk severely. Compared with PP, PAN/SPEEK/(CS/MWNTs-COOH)(10) showed the discharge capacity of 956.9mAh/g at 0.1 C and maintained 463mAh/g after 100 cycles with the capacity retention rate of 48.4% which is higher than that of the commercial PP separator. Thus, this work can provide a simple method for modifying separator for long-life lithium-sulfur battery.

A high sulfur loading of 7.5 mg/cm(2) is achieved, which delivers a high initial areal capacity of 9.0 mAh/cm(2) and stable cycling capacity at around 7.0 mAh/cm(2) in the following cycles.

Multifunctional Electrocatalytic Cathodes Derived from Metal-Organic Frameworks for Advanced Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL			English	Article						electrochemical energy storage; electrochemistry; lithium-sulfur batteries; metal-organic frameworks; sulfur cathode	DOPED CARBON COMPOSITES; REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; ANODE MATERIALS; NANOPARTICLES; POLYSULFIDES; NANOTUBES; POLYHEDRON; HYBRID; SITES; HOST	The rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is a promising candidate for the next generation of energy storage technology, owing to the high theoretical capacity, high specific energy density, and low cost of electrode materials. The main drawbacks in the development of long-life Li-S batteries are capacity fading and the sluggish kinetics at the cathode caused by the polysulfides shuttle. These limitations are addressed through the design of novel nanocages containing cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles embedded in highly porous nitrogen-doped carbon (CoP-N-GC) by thermal annealing of ZIF-67 in a reductive atmosphere followed by a phosphidation step using sodium hypophosphite. The CoP nanoparticles, with large surface area and uniform homogeneous distribution within the N-doped nanocage graphitic carbon, act as electrocatalysts to suppress the shuttle of soluble polysulfides through strong chemical interactions and catalyze the sulfur redox. As a result, the S@CoP-N-GC electrode delivers an extremely high specific capacity of 1410 mA h g(-1)at 0.1 C (1 C=1675 mA g(-1)) with an excellent coulombic efficiency of 99.7 %. Moreover, capacity retention from 864 to 678 mA h g(-1)is obtained after 460 cycles with a very low decay rate of 0.046 % per cycle at 0.5 C. Therefore, the combination of the CoP catalyst and polar conductive porous carbon effectively stabilizes the sulfur cathode, enhancing the electrochemical performance and stability of the battery.

However, the drawbacks such as low pore volumes and insolubilities of micro- and mesoporous conjugated polymers restrict the loading of electroactive materials and thus energy storage performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of iron-doped macroporous conjugated polymers for hosting sulfur as the cathode of high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The macroporous conjugated polymers are synthesized via in situ growth of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets, followed by gelation of the composite (RGO-g-P3HT) in p-xylene and freeze-drying. The network structures of the macroporous materials can be readily tuned by controlling the chain length of P3HT grafted to RGO sheets. The large pore volumes of the macroporous RGO-g-P3HT materials (ca. 34 cm(3) g(-1)) make them excellent frameworks for hosting sulfur as cathodes of Li-S batteries. Furthermore, incorporation of Fe into the macroporous RGO-g-P3HT cathode results in reduced polarization, enhanced specific capacity (1,288, 1,103, and 907 mA h g(-1) at 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 C, respectively), and improved cycling stability (765 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C). Density functional theory calculations and in situ characterizations suggest that incorporation of Fe enhances the interactions between lithium polysulfides and the P3HT framework.

We introduce several scalable synthesis routes to fabricate carbon onion-sulfur hybrids by adopting in situ and melt diffusion strategies with sulfur fractions up to 68 mass%. The conducting skeleton of agglomerated carbon onions proved to be responsible for keeping active sulfur always in close vicinity to the conducting matrix. Therefore, the hybrids are found to be efficient cathodes for Li-S batteries, yielding 97-98% Coulombic efficiency over 150 cycles with a slow fading of the specific capacity (ca. 660 mA h g(-1) after 150 cycles) in long term cycle test and rate capability experiments.

In this study, Li2S is embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) micro-/mesoporous carbon architecture with a tunable internal structure, low density, suitable void volume, and pore size via carbonization. The mesoporous internal structure can offer considerable voids for volume change and a fast transfer route of charges and ions, and the microporous coating layer could physically block the shuttle of polysulfides and accommodate the diffusion of Li+ ions. The results show that the as-fabricated Li2S/CMK3/C has a high lithium sulfide loading of 79 wt %. At the same time, the battery delivers a high specific capacity of 848 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and a good capability of 410 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 2 C. Therefore, the Li2S-embedded 3D micro-/mesoporous carbon architecture could be a significant option for the development and industrialization of high-performance LSBs.

The shells of the hollow silica nanospheres are composed of flake-like nanoparticles with dense big holes on the surface. After covering a layer of sulfur on the silica nanospheres, followed by hydrothermal treatment in a D-glucose aqueous solution, silica-sulfur and silica-sulfur-carbon nanospheres were successfully fabricated. The silica-sulfur composites exhibit a stable capacity of 454 mAh g(-1) at current density of 335 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles with capacity retention of 85%, demonstrating a promising cathode material for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries. We believe that the approach for synthesis of porous hollow silica nanospheres and its carbon spheroidal shell can also be applicable for designing other electrode materials for energy storage.

However, the practical application of the Li-S battery is hindered by the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and slow redox reactions. Herein, a 3D nitrogen-doped graphene/titanium nitride nanowires (3DNG/TiN) composite is reported as a freestanding electrode for Li-S batteries. The highly porous conductive graphene network provides efficient pathways for both electrons and ions. TiN nanowires attached on the graphene sheets have a strong chemical anchor effect on the polysulfides, which is proved by the superior performance and by density functional theory calculations. As a result, the 3DNG/TiN cathode exhibits an initial capacity of 1510 mAh g(-1) and the capacity remains at 1267 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. Even at 5 C, a capacity of 676 mAh g(-1) is reached. With a high sulfur loading of 9.6 mg cm(-2), the 3DNG cathode achieves an ultrahigh areal capacity of 12.0 mAh cm(-2) at a high current density of 8.03 mA cm(-2). This proposed unique structure gives a bright prospect in that high energy density and high power density can be achieved simultaneously for Li-S batteries.

It has been recognized that MXene has strong adsorption of polysulfides due to the Lewis acidic surface. In this work, a crumpled nitrogen-doped porous MPF13-550 composite is synthesized through freeze-dried and high-temperature carbonized methods, in which the monomers of formaldehyde and pyrrole induced by Ti3C2Tx MXene form polymer gels as precursors. The asprepared MPF13-550 possesses a large specific surface area (179 m2 g-1) and high nitrogen doping (10.22 at.%). The multifunctional separator fabricated by coating the commercial polypropylene (PP) separator with MPF13550 (MPF13-550/PP) is applied in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, in which the functional separator has the advantages of immobilizing lithium polysulfides via strong chemisorption and reactivation of sulfur because of the high conductivity. Consequently, the Li-S battery with the MPF13-550/PP separator exhibits high initial discharge capacity (1235 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C), good rate capabilities (593 mA h g-1 at 2.0 C), and remarkable cycling performance (721 mA h g-1 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles).

To overcome these challenges, an in situ method to chemically attach graphene oxide to the surface of sulfur-rich copolymers is developed in this study. Herein, novel conductive sulfur-rich copolymer composites, cp(S-r-DIB)-Cy-rGO (cpSDG), with a high sulfur copolymerization degree of ca. 52 at % and excellent capacity rates of 1227 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 950 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, have been obtained by covalently bonding cysteamine-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (Cy-rGO) to the surface of the sulfur-rich polymer matrix (cp(S-r-DIB)). Compared to a copolymer without Cy-rGO loading and pure sulfur cathodes, the composites display significant enhancements of lithium-ion diffusion coefficients and a higher cycling stability, with a capacity decay of only 0.06% per cycle.

In particular, the carbon nanofibers for the cathode and the poly(acrylonitrile)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PAN/PMMA) membrane for the GPE are prepared by electrospinning technique. The GPE consists of electrospun PAN/PMMA membrane and 1 mol kg(-1) lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide in N-methyl-N-butylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PPR14TFSI) and poly (ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME). The membrane and cell performances are investigated by scanning electron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is found that the cell using the GPE based on PAN/PMMA membrane and PPR14TFSI-PEGDME (1:1) exhibits the largest discharge capacity and the best cycle durability. The discharge capacity of this cell remains at 760 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles. This new sulfur/electrolyte system combines the advantages of the carbon nanofibers that provide an effective conduction path and network-like structure, and the GPE that suppresses the dissolution of the intermediate products generated during the discharge process. The ratio of PPR14TFSI to PEGDME affects the ionic conductivity of the GPE, the stability of the sulfur electrode and the compatibility of lithium electrode with the GPE. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, a novel and effective method is developed to grow bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) across three-dimensional N-doped porous carbon network (NPCNs) via chemical vapor deposition, thereby successfully preparing the sulfur-loaded composite carbon material inserted into the porous network. In such structure, carbon nanotubes act as electronic conduction paths, carbon networks as mass transfer channels, as well as the inserted Fe3C nanoparticles can increase the polarity of the carbon matrix. The discharge capacity of the S-NCNT/NPCNs cathode, as high as 1125 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, retains 43.5% of its value when the current is increased 10-fold to 2 C. A specific capacity of 548.1 mAh g(-1) at 1 C remains almost unchanged after 300 cycles, demonstrating better charge and discharge performance and excellent cycling ability of these promising candidate materials for Li-S battery applications. More importantly, the synthesis strategy is universal and can be fully extended to prepare other units, even binary NCNT/NPCNs (for example, NCNT/NPCNs-Co, NCNT/NPCNs-Co-Fe, NCNT/NPCNs-Fe-Ni, and NCNT/NPCNs-Co-Ni). The new strategy provided here may open up new ways for the application of hybrid carbon nanostructures in energy storage systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, ultrafine NbN decorated nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets are reported via C3N4 sacrifice template using phenolic resol as carbon precursor. The ultrafine NbN nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbons guarantee efficient polysulfides trapping and fast redox reaction kinetics even with a high sulfur content of 75 wt%. In addition, porous carbon nanosheets and NbN nanoparticles provide more active sites for Li2S nucleation and serve as a second host for the reuse of sulfur. Hence, the lithium-sulfur cells with NbN@CNS-5 modified multifunctional separator deliver a high initial capacity of 1252 mAh g-1 @ 0.2 C, 683 mAh g-1 @ 4 C, and high capacity retention of 84.5% after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Furthermore, a high initial capacity of 4.95 mAh cm-2 and 4.01 mAh cm-2 @0.2 C after 200 cycles are achieved at a sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm-2. These findings open up a new method for the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries with superior sulfur utilization and a long lifespan.

However, the large volume variation and side reaction greatly limit the application of Bi2S3. Hence, the Bi2S3 nanorod-encapsulated into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were prepared by a facile method. In such a structure, the walls of the CNTs can be used as a physical barrier, which may segregate the Bi2S3 nanorods from the electrolyte to avoid the side reaction. Moreover, enough space in the structure can accommodate the volume variation during cycling to retain the integrity of the electrode and improve the cycling stability. Therefore, as the anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), it shows a high capacity of 581 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1 A g(-1). Meanwhile, as the sulfur host, the conductivity of the cathode is largely enhanced due to the existence of a carbon matrix. Also, the diffusion of lithium polysulfides can be curbed under the synergy of the chemical adsorption of Bi2S3 nanorods and the physical retention of CNTs. Therefore, the CNTs@Bi2S3/S electrode also exhibits advanced performance in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). This work provides an innovative idea for the application of Bi2S3 in both LIBs and LSBs.

In this study, a novel three-dimensionally interconnected network structure comprising Co9S8 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was synthesized by a solvothermal route and used as the sulfur host. The assembled batteries delivered a specific capacity of 1154 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, and the retention was 64% after 400 cycles at 0.5 C. The polar and catalytic Co9S8 nanoparticles have a strong adsorbent effect for polysulfide, which can effectively reduce the shuttling effect. Meanwhile, the three-dimensionally interconnected CNT networks improve the overall conductivity and increase the contact with the electrolyte, thus enhancing the transport of electrons and Li ions. Polysulfide adsorption is greatly increased with the synergistic effect of polar Co9S8 and MWCNTs in the three-dimensionally interconnected composites, which contributes to their promising performance for the lithium-sulfur batteries.

Accelerating the reaction kinetics of the LiPSs conversion is proved to be effective in suppressing the migration of LiPSs. Herein, we propose an effective KB/Mo2C-modified separator for enabling stable Li-S batteries. The Mo2C shows both favorable anchoring capability and catalysis activity for LiPSs conversion due to its strong chemical affinity with LiPSs. The reaction kinetics of LiPSs reduction are facilitated on the Mo2C surface, and the activation potential of lithium sulfide (Li2S) oxidation is reduced. The battery using the modified separator shows high active material utilization and long-term cycling stability with a low decay rate of 0.076% per cycle up to 600 cycles at 1C. Moreover, when the sulfur loading increases to 6.5 mg cm(-2), a high areal capacity of 5.2 mAh cm(-2) can be maintained after 60 cycles with a capacity retention of 87%, demonstrating the feasibility for practical applications in Li-S batteries.

However, low electronic conductivity and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) severely hindered their commercial applications. To address the issues effectively, herein, a transition metal phosphate-VOPO4 was introduced into Li-S battery cathode, supplemented with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a conductive agent. Density functional theory method revealed that VOPO4 has strong polysulfides anchoring due to high abundant polar active site, which improved the electrochemical performances of sulfur cathode. At 0.5 C, the S/(VOPO4 + CNTs) electrode presents a discharge capacity of up to 912.8 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles. Even at 2 C, it also kept stable at 623.8 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles. The results showed that VOPO4 provided a helpful reference to have effectively expanded the applications and promoted the performance of Li-S batteries.

Structural and morphological analysis indicates a highly dispersed non-crystalline state of sulfur throughout the material. Raman theoretical calculation reveals sulfur molecules in SG are identical to calculated S-8 allotrope. The resulting SG cathode provides high sulfur utilization of 97.67% as it delivers an extremely high initial capacity of 1636.1mAh g(-1) at 0.2C. Even at high rates such as 1C and 3C, SG still delivers excellent performance. Moreover their capacity retention is high around 64.84% and 67.86% after 50 cycles at 1C and 3C, respectively. It exhibits outstanding stable cycling capability, with an initial capacity at 866.9mAh g(-1) at 5C with a remaining capacity of 385.4mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles. Such exceptional performance lay in the highly dispersed nature of amorphous sulfur, the unique three dimensional architecture of graphene coupled to its strong intimate contact with sulfur. The presented design is extremely simple, scalable and promising for future commercialization of Li-S cells.

Herein, by coupling ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), one multifunctional sulfur host CNT/ZnS-QDs is designed via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. SEM and TEM analyses reveal that small ZnS-QDs (<5 nm) are uniformly anchored on the CNT surface as well as encapsulated into CNT channels. This special architecture ensures sulfur direct contacting with highly conductive CNTs; meanwhile, the catalytic effect of anchored ZnS-QDs improves the chemisorption and confinement to polysulfides. Benefiting from these merits, when used as sulfur hosts, this special architecture manifests a high specific capacity, superior rate capability, and long-term cycling stability. The ZnS-QDs dependent electrochemical performance is also evaluated by adjusting the mass ratio of ZnS-QDs, and the host of CNT/ZnS-QDs 27% owns the optimal cell performance. The specific capacity decreases from 1051 mAh g(-1)at 0.2 C to 544 mAh g(-1)at 2.0 C, showing rate capability much higher than CNT/S and other CNT/ZnS-QDs/S samples. After 150 cycles, the cyclic capacity at 0.5 C exhibits a slow reduction from 1051 mAh g(-1)to 771 mAh g(-1), showing a high retention of 73.4% with a coulombic efficiency of over 99%. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses demonstrate that this special architecture juggles high conductivity and excellent confinement of polysulfides, which can significantly suppress the notorious shuttle effect and accelerate the redox kinetics. The strategy in this study provides a feasible approach to design efficient sulfur hosts for realizing practically usable LSBs.

Encapsulation of sulfur in porous carbon materials has been demonstrated as a promising strategy for overcoming these challenges, but the atomic-level details of its dynamic processes have not been fully understood yet. Herein, we used reactive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural evolution, chemical process, and diffusion behavior of the sulfur confined in carbon nanotube during lithiation and delithiation. Our simulations show distinctive spatial distribution of the material comprising a relatively large amount of lithium bounded near the free surface due to complex interactions, which can retard the formation of the electrochemically inactive Li2S layer during lithiation. This also results in a low lithium fraction remaining in the cathode and improved structural reversibility during the reverse process. Furthermore, the unique structural evolution of the material inside carbon nanotube results in the voltage profile distinguishable from the unconfined systems. Our simulations also provide an atomistic view of restricted migration of the sulfur molecules trapped inside the pore, which could be the origin of cycle retention enhancement.

The large surface area of hollow zeolite microcakes can increase the amount of sulfur storage. Moreover, the special hollow zeolite microcakes with polypyrrole coating enhance sulfur utilization. Consequently, the as-prepared composite electrode deliveres a capacity of 753 mAh g(-1) after cycling 200 times at 0.1 A g(-1), and a capacity of 460 mAh g(-1) after cycling 500 times at 0.5 A g(-1), which are much higher than those of the hollow zeolite microcakes without polypyrrole coating.

Li-S batteries are attractive due to their high specific capacity and energy density. However, sluggish sulfur redox reaction and polysulfide dissolution are significant challenges in Li-S batteries. In this work, we report graphene with doped layer to electrocatalyze the sluggish sulfur redox reaction. The doped layer comprises heteroatoms such as either N or N and S. The doped layer also comprises cations of Ni. We have chosen a "doped layer on graphene" over "doped graphene" to avoid defects in the basal plane of graphene. We found the doped layer comprising graphene (DLC-G) to electrocatalyze the polysulfide redox reaction. However, the interaction between the doped layer and polysulfide is still weak, hence the dissolution is not suppressed. To circumvent the polysulfide dissolution, graphene with cationic layer was prepared. We found that cations in the layer electrostatically attract the polysulfides due to the polyvalent interaction. Thus, the dissolution is suppressed. While using this material in the Li-S batteries, the specific capacity, energy density and power density were found to be 1345 mAh g(-1), 782 Wh kg(-1) and 4437 W kg(-1), respectively.

The obtained NOPC has very large specific surface area of 2294 m(2) g(-1) and high pore volume of 1.15 cm(3) g(-1). Thanks to the high specific surface area and the doping of nitrogen and oxygen, the prepared NOPC/S cathode with a sulfur content of 55.9% shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1338 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and retains 1047 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. What is more, the NOPC/S-62.9% cathode also remains high capacity of 1036 mA h g(-1) and the coulomb efficiency remains 98.3% after 200 cycles.

The development of a new cell configuration is a simple and effective method of resolving the above problems. Here, we use electrospun carbonized silk nanofiber film as the cathode-and anode-interlayer for lithium-sulfur batteries. The interwoven network and microprous structure of interlayer improves the sulfur cathode conductivity and curbs the "shuttle effect"; the anode-interlayer acts as a protective layer to reduce the lithium corrosion. Having a sulfur loading of 2.0 mg cm(-2), the sulfur cathode-interlayer combined with the lithium anode-interlayer shows a reversible capacity of 799 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C with 0.018% average capacity loss per cycle. At a rate of 1.0 C, the discharge capacity remains at 655 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 97.3%. This new cell configuration with a double-interlayer based on carbonized silk nanofiber opens up another path for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries to deal with a variety of challenges.

However, the main challenges associated with the dissolution of lithium polysulfides and low conductivity of sulfur are still required to be overcome to achieve improved cycling life and power density. Herein, we design and synthesize a hierarchical mesoporous carbon (HMC) through one-step pyrolysis of a low-cost polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) precursor with a sodium hydroxide activating agent for an efficient encapsulating host for sulfur. By impregnating sulfur into carbon via a melt-diffusion process, the HMC/sulfur composite contains a high sulfur content (similar to 72 wt%) inside the mesopore-dominant host. Moreover, with a multifunctional polyvinylpyrrolidone coating, the obtained composite exhibits an enhanced electrochemical performance including high specific capacity (1124 mA h 8(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and good cycling life with a reversible capacity of 456 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 800 mA g(-1). Both the hierarchical mesoporous nature of the carbon host and the protective coating not only suppresses the polysulfide dissolution but also provides improved interfacial stability and facile charge transport pathways. This strategic combination leads to high reversible capacity, enhanced cycling reversibility, and good rate capability of the high sulfur loading cathodes.

High capacity polycarbazole-sulfur cathode for use in lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Electropolymerization; Polycarbazole; Polycarbazole-sulfur cathode; Lithium-sulfur battery	POROUS CARBON MATERIALS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; POLYPYRROLE COMPOSITE; ENHANCED PERFORMANCE; CYCLING STABILITY; ELECTROLYTE; ELECTROPOLYMERIZATION; NANOTUBES; POLYMER; CONDUCTIVITY	The potential use of electrochemically polymerized polycarbazole as an additive in lithium-sulfur battery cathodes has been investigated. Optimization of the polymer properties considered solvent, electrolyte and current-time profile during electropolymerization. It was found that electrodeposition from LiClO4-acetonitrile electrolyte and constant-potential deposition (at 1.15 V vs Ag/Ag+) gives the highest initial discharge capacity. This is most likely due to an optimum combination of specific surface area and conductivity. To improve the quality of the cathode, a slurry of carbon disulfide and dimethyl formamide was devised to balance the dispersion of carbon black and the solubility of sulfur. In 2032-coin cells, against a lithium anode, a polycarbazole-sulfur (PCBz-S) cathode with 30% sulphur showed the highest initial discharge capacity. A very good coulombic efficiency of around 98% and a capacity retention of over 91% for 50 charge/discharge cycles were obtained for the optimized PCBz-S cathode. Based on the cycling performance, PCBz is a potentially useful additive to mitigate the polysulfide shuttle effect. In addition, the electropolymerized carbazole matches the performance of a commercial polypyrrole that has been widely used as a conductive binder. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the shuttling of soluble polysulfides with slow redox reaction kinetics has restricted the commercialization of LSBs. The design and synthesis of effective cathode hosts provide a promising solution to improving the electrochemical performances of LSBs. Herein, we report a composite of macro/mesoporous carbon (MMC) coupled with defective TiO2 nanoparticles as a novel functional cathode host for LSBs. The MMC/TiO2 composite has been synthesized using a template-based approach combining simple hydrothermal reactions. Experimental characterizations, electrochemical measurements, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclose that the combination of macro/mesoporous carbon and defective TiO2 (coexistence of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+) effectively suppresses the undesired polysulfide shuttling effect and promotes fast redox conversion of polysulfides during cycling. The resultant LSBs with MMC/TiO2@S as a composite cathode thus exhibit impressive electrochemical properties with high capacity (1420 mAh/g at 0.2C), good rate capability (522 mAh/g at 2C), and cycling ability (65.6% retention at 0.2C over 60 cycles). This work can present some new insights into the rational design and exploration of novel material systems and compositions for applications in LSBs.

Herein, a novel 3D hierarchical architecture composed of TiO2/epitaxially aligned MoS2-carbon coupled interface nanosheets is reported for boosting sodium-ion storage and lithium-sulfur batteries, in which the MoS2 nanosheets are epitaxially aligned grown on the surface of carbon nanosheets through a simple calculation conversion process. The resulting hybrid demonstrates ultralong-life performance for sodium-ion storage and lithium-sulfur batteries, owing to synergistic effects among the stable TiO2 nanowires, the high-conductivity carbon nanosheets, and the vertical MoS2 nanostructure. Even at a high current density of 8 A g(-1), the capacity can be maintained at 169 mA h g(-1) after 15 000 cycles, one of the highest values for TiO2-based electrodes. Moreover, such peculiar sheet-on-sheet structure also brings benefits for lithium-sulfur batteries, providing an effective physical shield against polysulfide shuttling and chemical adsorption of polysulfides, with a low fading rate (0.039% per cycle over 1500 cycles). The present work highlights that this rationally designed hybrid nanoarchitecture is an effective strategy to boost the stability of electrochemical energy storage.

Herein, well-dispersed amorphous Ta2O5 was chemically grafted onto oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT-O) under mild conditions by a one-pot solvent evaporation method. The prepared Ta2O5/CNT-O composite was used as a modified separator layer in a Li-S battery, which combined the advantages of the intertwined structure of conductive CNT-O and the chemisorption ability of Ta2O5. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) verified the catalytic effect of Ta2O5 on the redox reactions during the discharge/charge processes and the strong chemical interactions between polysulfides and Ta2O5. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the modified separators after cycling revealed that the well-dispersed amorphous Ta2O5 could immobilize soluble polysulfides through chemical interactions and prevent aggregation of the insoluble products (Li2S2, LiS2 and S-8) during the redox reactions, leading to a uniform redistribution of the sulfur species inside the modification layer, which could ensure the conductivity of the modification layer and high utilization rate of sulfur during long-term cycling processes. A Li-S cell prepared with Ta2O5/CNT-O modified separator exhibited a high initial specific capacity of 1230.7 mAh/g at a current density of 0.2 C and stable cycle performance with a decay rate of only 0.11% per cycle over 500 discharge/charge cycles.

However, most central ions in MOFs-derived carbon framework are encapsulated in the carbon matrix so that their exposures as active sites to adsorb polysulfides are limited. To resolve this issue, highly dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles are anchored into the cobalt-containing carbon polyhedras that are converted from ZIF-67. Such a type of TiO2 and Co nanoparticles-decorated carbon polyhedras (C-Co/TiO2) provide more exposed active sites and much stronger chemical trapping for polysulfides, hence improving the sulfur utilization and enhancing reaction kinetics of sulfur-containing cathode simultaneously. The sulfur-containing carbon polyhedras decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles (S@C-Co/TiO2) show a significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability, and deliver a discharge capacity of 32.9% higher than that of TiO2-free S@C-Co cathode at 837.5 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles.

Herein, a multifunctional interlayer is developed by growing metallic molybdenum disulfide nanosheets on both outer and inner walls of cotton cloth derived carbon microtube textile (MoS2@CMT). The hollow structure of CMT provides channels to favor electrolyte penetration, Li(+)diffusion and restrains polysulfides via physical confinement. The hydrophilic and conductive 1T-MoS(2)nanosheets facilitate chemisorption and kinetic behavior of polysulfides. The synergic effect of 1T-MoS(2)nanosheets and CMT affords the MoS2@CMT interlayer with an efficient trapping-diffusion-conversion ability toward polysulfides. Therefore, the cell with the MoS2@CMT interlayer exhibits enhanced cycling life (765 mAh g(-1)after 500 cycles at 0.5 C) and rate performance (974 mAh g(-1)at 2 C and 740 mAh g(-1)at 5 C). This study presents a pathway to develop low-cost multifunctional interlayers for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries.

Polysulfides, the intermediates generated during cycling, may shuttle between electrodes, compromising the energy density and cycling life. We report herein a class of regenerative polysulfide-scavenging layers (RSL), which effectively immobilize and regenerate polysulfides, especially for electrodes with high sulfur loadings (e.g., 6 mg cm(-2)). The resulting cells exhibit high gravimetric energy density of 365 Wh kg(-1), initial areal capacity of 7.94 inAh cm(-2), low self discharge rate of 2.45% after resting for 3 days, and dramatically prolonged cycling life. Such blocking effects have been thoroughly investigated and correlated with the work functions of the oxides as well as their bond energies with polysulfides. This work offers not only a class of RSL to mitigate shuttling effect but also a quantified design framework for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the development of Li-S battery is seriously hindered by the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides. Up to now, almost in all the researches related to sulfur cathode, the polysulfide motion restricting strategy is used to suppress the "shuttle effect". However, this issue still cannot be thoroughly solved. Here, we report a new polysulfide generation restricting strategy to eliminate the "shuttle effect" in Li-S batteries by turning the S-8 molecules into stably adsorbed small sulfur species with suitable solid redox mediators (RMs) to generate an S-2(sigma-)-RM sigma+ at the very beginning. In this way, the mediators (S-2(sigma-)-RM sigma+) are reduced into Li2S2 and Li2S directly without soluble polysulfide forming during the discharging process. Therefore, the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides (Li2S8, Li2S6, and Li2S4) is absolutely eliminated. This new polysulfide generation restricting strategy is realized by using a TiOxNy-TiO2 quantum dots@carbon composite (TiONQDs@C) as a sulfur host. The TiONQDs@C is proved to be an efficient RM to convert S-8 molecules into stably adsorbed S-2(sigma-)-RM sigma+ species, eliminating the formation of lithium polysulfide completely. Owing to the new mechanism, the Li-S battery with TiONQDs@C host achieves a capacity of 869 mA h g(-1) (96% of the initial capacity) after 200 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.02% per cycle. This strategy provides a new way to thoroughly solve the "shuttle effect" in Li-S batteries.

However, the severe shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides leads to rapid capacity decay during battery cycling, especially at high sulfur loading and high current density. Herein, the MnO nanoparticles covered carbon with endoplasmic-reticulum-like structure (MnO@ERC) as separator coating for Li-S batteries is proposed. The MnO@ERC coating can act as upper current collector to enhance electrical conductivity of cathode and decrease the interface impedance of the whole battery. More importantly, both the polar MnO nanoparticles and Mn3O4 formed at the end of the charging process can catalyze the conversion of lithium polysulfides, which is convinced by the high adsorption energy and the elongate S-S bond. As a result, Li-S batteries based on MnO@ERC coating separator showed stable cycle for 350 cycles under 0.5C, high discharge specific capacity of 783.6 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, 534.7 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles under the sulfur loading of 5.26 mg cm 2 and low self-discharge rate of 9.1% after resting 48 h..

Graphene-coated mesoporous carbon/sulfur cathode with enhanced cycling stability	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Sulfur cathode; Mesoporous carbon; Graphene; Cycling stability; Lithium-sulfur battery	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; CARBON NANOFIBER; LI-ION; COMPOSITE; PERFORMANCE; CYCLABILITY; CAPACITY; OXIDE	A self-assembly approach is used to fabricate a graphene-coated mesoporous carbon/sulfur composite. The graphene coating on the surface of the composite is 15-20 nm in thickness, and sulfur is well dispersed in the pores of mesoporous carbon and the interfaces between the mesoporous carbon and graphene sheets after a heat treatment at 300 degrees C. The graphene coating helps to increase the sulfur content and retard the diffusion of polysulfides. The galvanostatic charge-discharge tests show that the graphene-coated sulfur electrode presents good cycling stability. Specific discharge capacities up to 650 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.1 C is achieved with enhanced coulombic efficiency, representing a promising cathode material for lithium-sulfur battery.

Here, we fully investigate loading content of Li2S on the V2CTx hybrid structure as a cathode, the open circuit voltage profile during the charge/discharge process, and the Li+ transfer energy barrier on the V2CTx surface using first-principles method. Our results indicate that V2CO2 would be one of the most suitable candidates for lithium-sulfur battery cathode. In Li2S@V2CO2 case, the lithium-oxygen bonding prevents sulfur from retaining its stable cyclical structure before lithiation yielding a distribution of sulfur chains tightly bonded to MXenes surface. Analysis of electron localization function indicates that the Li2S@V2CO2 composite include not only the covalent bonds of S-O, but also the ionic bonds of Li-O, which make the strong binding for this configuration. Also, nudged elastic band calculations indicate that the migration of Li ion on the both V2CO2 and V2C is very fast with energy barrier of 0.24 eV for V2CO2, 0.34 eV for V2C, which also can insure a good charge/discharge rate performance of the lithium-sulfur batteries. Finally, it might pave a way for the search of high-performance materials of energy storage devices.

The interlayer can substantially suppress the shuttle effect and improve the charge-discharge performance of the lithium-sulfur battery because of the catalytic effect and strong adsorption effect between interlayer and lithium polysulfides. With a sulfur areal loading of 4.54 mg cm(-2) and a sulfur mass content of 80% at the whole electrode level, the discharge specific capacity of the initial cycle is 947 mA h g(-1). It also contains more than 908 and 800 mA h g(-1) after 100 and 200 cycles at 0.1 C with such an interlayer. It is found that the capacity contribution from octasulfur to dilithium tetrasulfide is improved 35% and the utilization ratio of dilithium tetrasulfide to lithium sulfide improved 76% with an interlayer, which is the main reason for the improvement of the capacity. We believe that the cell configuration presented here coupled with further improvements of the sulfur electrode could help to alleviate some of the persistent problems in lithium-sulfur cells.

Here, we designed a TiS2 monolayer as the anchoring material of lithium-sulfur batteries to address the obstacles encountered by lithium-sulfur batteries. Our simulation results showed that the TiS2 monolayer has dynamic and thermal stability, and can maintain appropriate adsorption energy between -1.38 eV and -3.54 eV for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which can effectively anchor lithium polysulfide. Furthermore, TiS2 monolayer still maintains metallic properties after adsorption of lithium polysulfide, which ensures its excellent battery activity during charge and discharge. In addition, the surface of TiS2 monolayer has a lower Li2S decomposition barrier and a lower Li-ion migration barrier, making TiS2 monolayer a promising anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries.

The improved contents and dispersity of the Co-N-x active sites originate from the utilization of a tetraaminophthalocyanine precursor that is chemically bonded with the MWCNT. This significantly improves the exposure of the Co-N-x active sites to the active sulfur species. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Co-N-x sites exhibit dual lithiophilic/sulfiphilic binding with polysulfides. Promoted sulfur conversion kinetics were obtained, that enabled significantly improved sulfur utilizations, high-rate capability, and cycling stability. Specific capacities of 1303 and 759 mAh g(-1) were achieved at 0.2 and 3 C, respectively. Low capacity decay along cycling was also enabled, with 925 mAh g(-1) retained after 500 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5 C.

However, low active material utilization and sluggish reaction kinetics restrict their practical applications. Here, the redox reaction of these batteries was visualized, and their polysulfide component was established with their ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra through in-situ discharge observations. Liquid polysulfides with controllable component and concentration can be obtained by discharging solid sulfur into a determined potential. Fast and timely electrochemical conversion kinetics will occur due to the excellent wettability between polysulfides and carbon nanotube sponges (CNSs). In addition, the robust chemical interaction between liquid polysulfides and oxygen containing groups inhibit the shuttle effect to a certain extent. Accordingly, the polysulfides-CNSs cathode demonstrates high sulfur utilization that exceeds 60% after 200 cycles. The obtained Li-S battery exhibits remarkably long cycling stability for 1500 cycles at 1 C with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency.

The as-synthesized BNC-TN not only possesses mesoporous 2D sheet-like structure, adjustable B, N co-doping and TiN content, but also effectively alleviates the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle effect because of the porous framework, as well as polar TiN and doping heteroatoms as chemical anchors of LiPSs. S@BNC-TN cathode exhibited a high initial overall discharge capacity of 1130.9 mA h g(-1) and a discharge capacity of 951.5 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles. This material offers a promising pathway to alleviate challenges facing lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we reported an ingenious design of nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers with honeycomblike porous structure for the cathode of lithium-sulfur battery which can effectively suppress the "shuttle effect". The special porous material with three dimensional (3D) interconnected pore structure is beneficial to enhance the adsorption of lithium polysulfides and accommodate the volume expansion of active materials. In addition, the doped nitrogen can not only improve the conductivity of cathode, but also form a strong interfacial interaction to trap lithium polysulfides. Therefore, the battery with the cathode exhibited a high reversible discharge capacity of 1093.9 mAh g(-1) and good capacity retention of 76.0% after 300 cycles at 0.5C rate. After acidification, the cycling performance of the cathode could achieve upon 300 cycles with a very low decay rate of 0.027% at 0.5C. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The structure and composition of the prepared nitrogen doped graphene/sulfur (NGS/S) composites are confirmed with X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images shows the porous sulfur particles are well wrapped by NGS. Compared with graphene/sulfur (GS/S) composite, the NGS-1/S composite with high loading (80 wt%) of sulfur presents a remarkably higher reversible capacity (1356.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and long cycle stability (578.5 mAh g(-1) remaining at 1 C up to 500 cycles). Pyridinic-N rich NGS-1/S exhibits a better electrochemical performance than pyrrolic-N enriched NGS-2/S. The improvement of electrochemical properties could be attributed to the chemical interaction between the nitrogen functionalities on the surface of NGS and polysulfide as well as the enhanced electronic conductivity of the carbon matrix.

Inspired by a popcorn fabrication from corn raw, herein a unique porous macrocellular carbon composed of cross-linked nano/microsheets by a powerful puffing of rice precursor is described. The rice is directly puffed with a volume enlargement of approximate to 20 times when it is instantaneously released from a sealed environment with a high pressure of 1.0 MPa at 200 degrees C. Interestingly, when metal (e.g., Ni) nanoparticles are embedded in the puffed rice derived carbon (PRC), high-quality PRC/metal composites are achieved with attractive properties of a high electrical conductivity of approximate to 7.2 x 10(4) S m(-1), a large porosity of 85.1%, and a surface area of 1492.2 m(2) g(-1). The PRC/Ni are employed as a host in lithium-sulfur batteries. The designed PRC/Ni/S electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1257.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, a prolonged cycle life (821 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles), and enhanced rate capability, much better than other counterparts (PRC/S and rGO/S). The excellent properties are attributed to the advantages of PRC/Ni network with a high electrical conductivity, strong adsorption/blocking ability for polysulfides, and interconnected porous framework.

Herein, we report a new strategy to achieve extremely high energy lithium sulfur battery with dimethyl polysulfide intermediates, which can greatly increase the specific capacity to 1497.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, and dendrite-free lithium anode so as to ensure a long lifespan with 500 cycles. The brilliant performance is attributed to the radical exchange between sulfur and dimethyl polysulfide intermediates rather than lithium polysufides. Density functional theory calculations and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy verify the existence of dimethyl polysulfide intermediates and in-situ UV/Vis spectroscopy confirms that mechanism for exchange reaction of radicals can boost the capacity of sulfur cathodes by eliminating complications, such as shuttle effect associated with formation and transformation of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte. This study develops a new avenue for the innovative discharge intermediate design that helps increase capacity and stability for the practical application of lithium sulfur batteries.

LSBs can be built by employing (ultra) high-loading sulfur cathodes, which have rarely been realized due to massive passivation and shuttling. Herein, microspheres of a carbon-carbon nitride composite (C@CN) with large mesopores are fabricated via molecular cooperative assembly. Using the C@CN-based electrodes, the effects of the large mesopores and N-functional groups on the electrochemical behavior of sulfur in LSB cells are thoroughly investigated under ultrahigh sulfur-loading conditions (>15 mgS cm(-2)). Furthermore, for high-energy-density LSBs, the C@CN powders are pelletized into a thick free-standing electrode (thickness: 500 mu m; diameter: 11 mm) via a simple briquette process; here, the total amount of energy stored by the LSB cells is 39 mWh, corresponding to a volumetric energy density of 440 Wh L-1 with an areal capacity of 24.9 and 17.5 mAh cm(-2) at 0.47 and 4.7 mA cm(-2), respectively (at 24 mgS cm(-2)). These results have significantly surpassed most recent records due to the synergy among the large mesopores, (poly)sulfide-philic surfaces, and thick electrodes. The developed strategy with its potential for scale-up successfully fills the gap between laboratory-scale cells and practical cells without sacrificing the high areal capacity and high energy density, providing a solid foundation for the development of practical LSBs.

Herein, an integrated composite catalyst consisting of Co nanoparticles and single-atom (SA) Zn co-implanted in nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets grafted with carbon nanotubes (Co/SA-Zn@N-C/CNTs) is rationally developed toward this challenge. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the synergistically dual active sites of Co and atomic Zn-N-4 moieties with an optimal charge redistribution not only strongly confine the LiPSs but also effectively catalyze its conversion reactions by lowering the energy barrier from Li2S2 to Li2S while the N-doped porous carbon-grafted CNTs enables a large surface area for more active site exposure and provides a fast electron/ion pathway. Benefiting from synergies, Li-S batteries equipped with the Co/SA-Zn@N-C/CNTs-based sulfur cathode exhibit a high reversible capacity of 1302 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a low capacity fading rate of 0.033% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm(-2) at 0.2 C with the sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2) can be achieved. The present work may provide new insight into the design of high-performance sulfur-based cathodes for Li-S batteries.

However, the shuttle effect and slow redox reactions deteriorate the electrochemical performance and hinder their practical application. Herein, a spongy mesoporous titanium nitride (SMT) material is synthesized via a simple approach and used as an effective sulfur host. Consequently, the S/SMT electrode, with 70 wt% sulfur content, exhibits high initial capacity (1312 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (620 mA h g(-1) at 2.0C) and low capacity decay rate (0.058% and 0.048% per cycle at 1.0C and 2.0C, respectively).

However, the notorious "shuttle effect" is still the biggest obstacle to its practical application. In this work, the synergistic inhibitory effect on polysulfides shuttling has proposed by introducing a coating of ultrasmall Fe3O4 nanoparticles modified carboxylated carbon nanotubes (CNTs-COOH@Fe3O4) on a commercial separator. The carboxylated carbon nanotube networks can act as both physical barrier and ion shielding layer, preventing the migration of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the ultrasmall Fe3O4 nanoparticles can act as polysulfide-trapping centers to anchor polysulfides via robust chemical adsorption. In addition, the highly conductive CNTs-COOH@Fe3O4 coating can act as "upper current collector", promoting the kinetic conversion reaction of sulfur species and facilitating the reutilization of active materials. The synergistic effect of the ultralight separator coating (areal weight 1.79 g m(-2)) enables the Li-S batteries showing outstanding cycle stability (the capacity decay is as low as 0.032% per cycle at 1 C over 2000 cycles), excellent rate performance and superior anti-self-discharge capability. The proposed combination strategy paves the way to the simple and scalable preparation of advanced separators.

However, its commercial application has been obstructed by the rapid decline of capacity and short cycle life, which is mainly because of the dissolution behavior of polysulfides into electrolyte solution and subsequently continual shuttling effect. Some strategies including carbon carriers for loading sulfur, modification of electrolyte and overall structure design of cell are brought forward to overcome the inherent defects of Li-S battery. Modified separators with multifunctional layer are also investigated extensively and benefit from their simple preparation method and enhanced electrochemical properties. Herein, nanosized Ti4O7 supported on mildly oxidized carbon nanotubes (oCNTs-Ti4O7) composite was synthetized and coated on the surface of separator to form modified layer, which is combined with the electrically conductive network structure of CNTs and effective adsorption of Ti4O7 nanoparticles. Compared with common separator, the modified separator with oCNTs-Ti4O7 layer can significantly improve the utilization of active substances as an additional current collector and restrain the shuttling effect of polysulfides by combination of physical obstruction and chemical adsorption. The Li-S battery has made great enhancements in electrochemical properties including cycle and rate performance. In particular, the cell using oCNTs-Ti4O7 separator has released specific discharge capacities of 888 and 658 mAh/g at a current density of 0.5C for the 1st and 250th cycle with a capacity retention of 74.1%. In the rate performance test, a discharge capacity of 586 mAh/g is still remained even at a high current density of 2C. Meanwhile, the test results of diffusion behavior indicate that the modified layer would not affect the normal transmission of lithium ions.

For the PDDA-GO composites, conducting polymers (PDDA) were coated on the surface of GO sheets. PDDA-GO composites could be expected to increase electrical conductivity and protect restacking of graphene sheets. And then, sulfur particles were dispersed into the PDDA-GO composites by mixing in the CS2 solvent. It is expected the PDDA-GO/S composites show the limited release of polysulfides due to the fact that it can provide high surface area, because conducting polymer can be used as spacer between graphene sheets. Electrochemical performances of prepared composites were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The PDDAGO/ S composites showed a high discharge capacity of 1102 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle and a good cycle retention of 60% after 100 cycles.

Herein, we report an efficient, facile, and cost-effective carbon-tungsten disulfide twisted cloth fibers (C/WS2-TCF/S) as a 3D cathode for Li-S battery. The C/WS2-TCF/S cathode combines the advantages of evenly-dispersed C/WS2 matrices and interconnected twisted cloth fiber networks which trap the polysulfide species, accommodate large active sulfur, and maintain the stable cycling performance even cycled at higher sulfur loading. In situ Raman spectroscopy further reveals the low shuttling effect observed with C/WS2-TCF/S cathode. With sulfur loadings of 2 mg cm(-2), 3.5 mg cm(-2), and 5 mg cm(-2), C/WS2-TCF/S cathode shows high specific capacities at 1C. Moreover, for a sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2), an initial discharge capacity of 722 mA h g(-1) is delivered with capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle over 500 cycles at 0.5C. This work is valuable for the efficient design and preparation of high-loading cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries.

The hydroxyl-functionalized surface of Mo2C suppresses the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through strong interaction between Mo atoms on the MXenes surface and LiPSs. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are further introduced into Mo2C phase to enlarge the specific surface area of the composite, improve its electronic conductivity, and alleviate the volume change during discharging/charging. The strong surface-bound sulfur in the hierarchical Mo2C-CNTs host can lead to a superior electrochemical performance in lithium-sulfur batteries. A large reversible capacity of approximate to 925 mAh g(-1) is observed after 250 cycles at a current density of 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mAh g(-1)) with good rate capability. Notably, the electrodes with high loading amounts of sulfur can also deliver good electrochemical performances, i.e., initial reversible capacities of approximate to 1314 mAh g(-1) (2.4 mAh cm(-2)), approximate to 1068 mAh g(-1) (3.7 mAh cm(-2)), and approximate to 959 mAh g(-1) (5.3 mAh cm(-2)) at various areal loading amounts of sulfur (1.8, 3.5, and 5.6 mg cm(-2)) are also observed, respectively.

Impact of Compression on the Electrochemical Performance of the Sulfur/Carbon Composite Electrode in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS			English	Article						compressed electrodes; electrode tortuosity; lithium-sulfur batteries; operando X-ray diffraction; X-ray computed tomography	ENERGY DENSITY; CATHODE; TORTUOSITY; SEPARATORS; CONVERSION; SHUTTLE; BINDER	While lithium-sulfur batteries theoretically have both high gravimetric specific energy and volumetric energy density, only its specific energy has been experimentally demonstrated to surpass that of the state-of-the-art lithium-ion systems at cell level. One major reason for the unrealized energy density is the low capacity density of the highly porous sulfur/carbon composite as the positive electrode. In this work, mechanical compression at elevated temperature is demonstrated to be an effective method to increase the capacity density of the electrode by at least 90 % and moreover extends its cycle life. Distinct impacts of compression on the resistance profiles of electrodes with different thickness are investigated by tortuosity factors derived from both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray computed tomography and kinetic analysis based on operando X-ray diffraction. The results highlights the importance of a homogeneous electrode structure highlight lithium-sulfur system.

Acetylene black particles with the particle size of 50 nm are partially infiltrated with sulfur, just the outer surface are coated with polyaniline shell. When using as a cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries, it exhibits significantly enhanced rate capability (initial capacity of 810 mAh/g at 2C, 486 mAh/g at 5C), and rate stability after 500 cycles (> 351 mAh/g at 5C). This considerable electrochemical performance could be attributed to the highly uniform distribution of sulfur in the nanopores of the conductive acetylene black and the physical isolation of the sulfur with electrolyte by conductive polyaniline. This renders it to be a promising candidate for practical application in lithium sulfur batteries.

However, their practical viability is hampered by low electrochemical stability and efficiency, which results from severe polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling during cycling. We present here thin-layered MoS2 nanoparticles (MoS2-NPs) synthesized through a one-pot method and coated onto a commercial polymeric separator (as MoS2-NP-coated separator) as an effective LiPS mediator, facilitated by the nanodimension, polar interactions, and the better edge-binding sites of the MoS2-NPs. The resulting MoS2-NPs have an interlayer spacing of 0.55 nm and are stacked with a few layers. At a sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm(-2), the Li-S cell with a MoS2-NP-coated separator attains a peak discharge capacity of 983 mA h g(-1), improving the electrochemical utilization of sulfur. The cell is able to maintain a high capacity of 525 mA h g(-1) after 150 cycles at a C/5 rate. The MoS2-NPs are able to effectively anchor the LiPS species to their large S2- anions, enhancing the redox accessibility of sulfur cathodes and enabling better capacity retention.

Here, the design is reported of a lepidolite-modified polypropylene (C-Lepidolite@PP) separator to suppress polysulfide shuttling and accelerate the transformation of polysulfides. Because the electrons of S atoms transfer to the 3p antibonding orbits of Si atoms, lepidolite effectively confines polysulfides by forming strong Si-S bonds to weaken the S-S bonds of polysulfides. The ultralow lithium-ion diffusion barrier (0.081 eV) of lepidolite allows for free lithium-ion migration and thus significantly facilitates polysulfide conversion from liquid Li2S8 to solid Li2S to enable fast polysulfide redox for high-rate current operation. With the C-Lepidolite@PP design, Li-S batteries deliver an ultrahigh rate capability of 703 mAh g(-1) at 7 C and a high areal capacity of 7.53 mAh cm(-2) with a sulfur loading of 6.5 mg cm(-2). Moreover, the 15-d self-discharge rate is reduced by approximate to 85% with the C-Lepidolite@PP separator, which provides promise for the practical use of Li-S batteries.

Herein, ball milling sulfur with unzipped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (UMWNTs) was found to covalently immobilize sulfur nanoparticles to the UMWNTs and resulted in composites (designated as S@UMWNTs) with high electrical conductivity. The unzipping degree of MWNTs was first controlled to optimize the immobilization of sulfur nanoparticles to UMWNTs and the electrochemical performance of the resulting Li-S batteries. The presence of C-S covalent bonds between the UMWNTs and sulfur nanoparticles was verified using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the formation of C-S bonds was ascribed to the reactions between the mechanically-induced sulfur radicals and the functional groups of UMWNTs. As a result, when used as a cathode material for Li-S batteries, the S@UMWNTs exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a good long-term cycling stability and low capacity decay (e.g., ca. 0.09% per cycle over 500 charge/discharge cycles at 1 C) due to the suppression of the shuttling effect by the C-S covalent bonds.

In this paper, we design a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize MoS2 wrapped the MOFs-derived N-doped carbon nanorods as an effective sulfur host to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. In the hydrothermal process, the cubic zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF67) particles are connected together to form nanorods, and MoS2 nanosheets are wrapped on the surface of the nanorods. In this composite, the carbon nanorods derived from ZIF67 is the main host for S-loading, while N-doping can change the hybrid orbital form of carbon and significantly improve the chemical adsorption of polysulfide. The elemental cobalt and cobalt oxide derived from ZIF67 can improve the electronic conductivity and polarity of the composite. And MoS2 coating layer can provide more active sites, accelerate the sulfur redox reactions and effectively restrain the shuttle effect. The synergetic effects of above-mentioned factors make the MoS2@CZIF67/S composite cathode material shows excellent electrochemical performance. The composite shows high reversible specific capacities of 1391.9 and 806.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and 1C rate, respectively, and exhibits a capacity retention of 70.5% after 400 cycles at 1C rate.

Here we present a porous cathode architecture which suppresses the loss of active material and self-discharge behavior in Li-S systems. 3D sulfur-nickel foam cathodes (SNF cathodes) have porous, electrically conductive Ni foam substrates as bifunctional current collectors. It was found that these cathodes have a stable cycle life with a high discharge capacity retention rate of 92% after 50 cycles. Moreover, the SNF cathodes reduce the self-discharge and retain 85% of their original capacities after resting for two months. The porous architecture of Ni foam accommodates the active material and traps polysulfides in the cathode region during cycling and battery storage, effectively reducing the loss of active material and capacity. In addition, it provides an excellent internal electron transport network by ensuring intimate contact between the active material and Ni foam, resulting in low internal impedance and improved capacities. The study demonstrates that the 3D Ni foam is an attractive bifunctional current collector for Li-S batteries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, issues such as severe polarization and poor cycle stability caused by shuttle effect and slow sulfur redox kinetics limit their practical applications. Here, Co3Fe7 alloy embedded into nitrogen-doped hollow carbon sphere composite (CoFe/ NHCS) was synthesized as an electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. The Co3Fe7 alloy demonstrates a strong chemisorption and superior electrocatalytic conversion towards polysulfides, while the nitrogen-doped carbon hollow spheres promote Li+/electron transfer and physically suppress polysulfides shuttling. Their synergistic effect therefore could both accelerate the polysulfides redox conversion and inhibit the polysulfides loss. As a consequence, the Li-S batteries assembled with CoFe/NHCS-modified separators exhibit a superior rate capacity (1029 mAh/g at 2 C) and excellent cycling stability (644 mAh/g at 1 C after 500 cycles). Furthermore, even at a high sulfur loading of 6.7 mg/cm(2), a high areal capacity of 5.58 mAh/g is achieved, which is retained at 4.45 mAh/ cm(2) after 100 cycles. In addition, the CoFe/NHCS possesses an excellent stability in both physical structures and chemical properties over extended cycles, demonstrating its great potential for high-performance and long-cycle life Li-S batteries.

However, practical application of MS based sulfur cathodes is hindered by a slow conversion of sulfur species due to limited catalytic effect of MS for redox reactions of sulfur, and by the absence of a continuous conducting network in the cathode. To address these issues, we herein report the design and fabrication of a heterostuctured Co3S4/MnS nanotube array grown on carbon cloth (CC@CMS-NA) as a catalytic sulfur host for high performance LSB. According to the theoretical calculations and electrochemical test, Mn dopants can tune the electronic structure of Co3S4 to adsorb soluble LPS more effectively and engineer a catalytic heterogeneous surface to facilitate charge transport and enhance the conversion kinetics of sulfur species. Meanwhile, the 3D array structure avoids "dead" sites caused by the use of binder and conductive additive, and also provides rapid electron transport path. As a result, the CC@CMS-NA based sulfur cathodes with 3.2 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading exhibits an excellent cycle performance at a current density of 2.67 mA cm(-2) (95% retention of initial specific capacity after 200 cycles, namely 0.02% decay per cycle). Our work demonstrates that reasonable construction of heterogeneous structures is a promising strategy to improve the performance of MS based LSB. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We present here a flexible and robust paper electrode consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and activated carbon nanofibers (ACNF) loaded with MnO2 nanosheets to serve as an efficient sulfur host for Li/dissolved polysulfide batteries. This integrally-designed flexible host facilitates high sulfur loading, improves sulfur utilization, and suppresses effectively the parasitic shuttle. Accordingly, the Li/dissolved polysulfide cells with high sulfur loading exhibit a high-rate capacity of 780 mAh g(-1) at 2 C rate and a high capacity retention of 64% over 300 cycles, demonstrating great promise for practical applications of Li-S batteries. In addition, a stable lithium-metal anode resulting from the suppressed shuttle effect is also proved to contribute significantly to the promising cycling performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, nitrogen doped carbon encapsulated sulfur (S@NC) composite cathode material and NC-coated ZnS (ZnS@NC) anode material derived from the same ZnS precursors were prepared for full Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). For the purpose to investigate the relations between the carbon shell thickness and electrochemical behaviors, the S@NC hybrids with three different sulfur contents of 52.0, 66.5 and 79.2 wt% were prepared. When an as-prepared S@NC hybrid with a sulfur content of 66.5 wt% (S67@NC) was applied to a cathode in LSBs, it delivered a high discharge capacity (1092.8 mAh g(-1)), long-term cycling life and excellent rate property. Moreover, the ZnS@NC anode showed a high specific capacity (1062.8 mAh g(-1)), excellent stability, and better rate performance, as compared to ZnS without NC coating layers. Consequently, when the full LSB consists with nano structured S67@NC cathode and ZnS@NC anode, it delivered the high initial discharge capacity above 921.9 mAh g(-1) in a voltage window between 0.1 and 2.5 V. This enhanced electrochemical performance suggests that this full-cell system with S@NC and ZnS@NC composites could be a promising next-generation rechargeable battery platform.

To correlate the carbon properties (surface area and pore volume), the electrochemical performances of S/C composite cathodes with the same sulfur content (60 wt%) have been investigated in detail. S/KB and S/BP2000 composites with high surface porosity can provide more reactive sites for sulfur, which can result in increasing the utilization rate of sulfur, reducing the polarization, and improving the high-rate capability. Large pore volume can effectively capture the polysulfide species and improve easy passages for ion transport, which can promote long-term cycling stability and reduce the resistance of Li-S batteries.

The OMC with a BET surface area of 2102 m(2) g(-1), a pore volume of 2.0 cm(3) g(-1) and unique bimodal mesoporous (5.6/2.3 nm) structure, was prepared from a triconstituent co-assembly method. The resulting OMC/S nanocomposite material served as cathode of rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. It has been tested that the novel OMC/S cathode can deliver a superior reversible capacity and cyclability. In particular, the nanocomposite with a loading of 60 wt% sulfur (OMC/S-60) presents the highest sulfur utilization ca. 70%, an excellent high rate capability ca. 6C and a good cycling stability for up to 400 full charge-discharge cycles. The exceptional electrochemical performances are exclusively attributed to the large internal surface area and high porosity of the ordered mesoporous carbon, which favorites both electron and Li-ion transportations.

Herein, Mo2C nanocatalysts anchoring on holey graphene scaffold (Mo2C@HGr) is explored as a lightweight and ultrathin modified separator to conquer the above issues. The artificially customized holes on holey graphene sheets facilitate ionic transfer and electrolyte penetration, and further enhance the sulfur utilization under lean electrolyte conditions. The experimental results together with theoretic calculation demonstrate the favourable chemical adsorption ability of Mo2C sites that blocking the diffusion of LiPSs. Abundant triple-phase interfaces among Mo2C nanomediators, holey graphene and electrolyte boost the conversion kinetics of the intercepted LiPSs. As a result, the cell with Mo2C@HGr modified separator shows superior rate capability (836 mAh g(-1)) even at 5 C current with a negligible Mo2C@HGr loading of 0.08 mg cm(-2). Furthermore, ultrahigh areal capacity of 5.9 mAh cm(-2) is still attained with high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm(-2) under lean electrolyte operation (E/S = 5.6 mu L mg(-1)). This design concept can be extended to other graphene based multifunctional nanocomposite toward the development of more practical Li-S batteries.

Here, a zinc sulfide quantum dots/reduced graphene aerogel (ZnS-RGA) modified separator is developed for Li-S batteries. ZnS quantum dots function as the chemically LiPS-anchoring and catalytic sites that can simultaneously accelerate the sulfur redox reaction (SRR) and suppress the shuttle effect, while the 3D porous RGA further physically blocks the migration of LiPS. As a consequence, the Li-S batteries with ZnS-RGA modified separator present a high initial discharge capacity of 1211 mAh g -1 at 0.1 C and stable cycling performance over 500 cycles at 1 C. We believe the strategy incorporating the SRR catalysts with LiPS-immobilizing separator will be an appealing way for producing high-performance Li-S devices.

J	Wang, Y; Chen, Y; Li, X; Zhang, YY; Zhang, YJ; Zhao, JB				Wang, Ying; Chen, Yu; Li, Xue; Zhang, Yiyong; Zhang, Yingjie; Zhao, Jinbao			New understanding of the role of lithium nitrate additives in lithium-sulfur batteries	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE			Chinese	Article						lithium nitrate (LiNO3); lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery; lithium ion (Li+) migration number; shuttle effect		Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered to be one of the next-generation battery candidates and have been widely studied. Despite the obvious advantages of Li-S batteries, there are still many serious problems with sulfur electrode: The active material sulfur (S) and the final product lithium sulfide (Li2S) are both insulators, and the electronic conductivity is poor, so that a large amount of conductive agent must be added to the sulfur electrode; the large difference in density between S and Li2S makes the electrode undergo a huge volume change (about 80%) during the charge and discharge process, which easily leads to the collapse of the sulfur electrode structure, which leads to the degradation of the Li-S batteries performance; the lithium polysulfide produced during charge and discharge has extremely high solubility in ether electrolytes, resulting in the "shuttle effect". Especially, the "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfide has caused problems such as poor battery cycle performance, rapid capacity decay and overcharge, which severely restricted the further development and commercial application of Li-S batteries. As a key component of Li-S batteries, electrolyte not only plays a role in transmitting lithium cation (Li+) and conducting internal circuits, but also one of the main factors that determine the overall performance of the battery capacity and cycle stability. Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) has received widespread attention as an electrolyte additive for Li-S batteries, and its mechanism of action has also been studied in depth. However, this article provides a new understanding of the mechanism of LiNO3 additives through deep study and new experimental schemes. In this experimental scheme, the Li metal anode recycled by electrolyte containing LiNO3 additive and fresh sulfur electrode was used to reassemble the battery with the electrolyte without the LiNO3 additive; the sulfur electrode recycled by electrolyte containing LiNO3 additive and fresh Li metal anod were used to reassemble the battery with the electrolyte without the LiNO3 additive; both batteries have serious overcharging during the charging process, and the shuttle of polysulfide anions occurs. This shows that the mechanism of LiNO3 inhibiting the "shuttle effect" is not just to form SEI film. Through the ion migration number test, it is found that after adding LiNO3 additive, the migration number of Li+ increases, resulting in a significant decrease in the migration of polysulfide anions. It can be concluded that another effect of adding LiNO3 additives is to increase the migration number of Li+, thereby reducing the migration number of anions and effectively inhibiting the "shuttle effect". At present, the components of gunpowder (sulfur, nitrate, carbon) are concentrated in Li-S batteries, which may be potentially dangerous during commercial use. According to the new discovery of the role of LiNO3 additives in Li-S batteries in this work, future research work can be based on the migration number theory to find other electrolyte additives that can promote the migration number of lithium ions and interact with polysulfide anions. LiNO3 additives, thereby reducing the potential dangers of Li-S batteries in use.

However, their commercialization has been impeded by several problems, such as the poor conductivity of the active material sulfur and its discharge products, the volume expansion and the shuttle effect caused by the polysulfide intermediates dissolving in organic electrolytes. To address these problems well, we have constructed high sulfur content spherical sulfur-carbon nanotube-polyethylene glycol-nickel nitrate hydroxide (SCNT-PEG-NNH) composite material by using a simple ball-milling method. The conductivity of the composite material gets improvement due to the spherical conductive frame constructed by CNT, while the shuttle effect of polysulfides is well inhibited by the wrapping of the PEG and the fixation of NNH. The results of electrochemical tests have shown that the performance of cathode made by the SCNT-PEG-NNH composite material is greatly improved. Therefore, the SCNT-PEG-NNH composite material can be a promising cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The conductive skeleton with strong adsorption on lithium polysulfide can effectively build the electron transmission path and inhibit the shuttle effect. In this study, a new type of chlorella-based biomass carbon skeleton carrying TiO2 metal sites (TiO2@CBBC) is designed and synthesized, and it was used as a functional separator modification material for the lithium sulfur battery. The biomass carbon skeleton has a unique three-dimensional skeleton and a unique specific surface, which can carry uniform titanium active sites and rich oxygen negative ions, so as to build a functional network of electron conduction, adsorbing polysulfide intermediates and promoting the dynamics of the sulfur conversion reaction. The Li-S battery equipped with a functional TiO2@CBBC separator shows excellent rate performance and cycle performance. The initial capacity of the lithium sulfur battery is up to 1011 mAh g-1 at 2C and can maintain 92% of the specific capacity after 100 cycles. At a stricter rate of 3C, the battery can still operate stably, and the coulomb efficiency remains above 95% throughout the entire process. This work represents a promising approach for developing the stability of lithium-sulfur batteries at a high rate.

Especially the low price and abundant availability of sulfur as the cathode material and the high theoretical capacity in comparison to state-of-the art lithium-ion technologies are attractive features. Despite significant research achievements that have been made over the last years, fundamental (electro-) chemical questions still remain unanswered. This review addresses ten crucial questions associated with lithium-sulfur batteries and critically evaluates cur-rent research with respect to them. The sulfur-carbon composite cathode is a particular focus, but its complex interplay with other hardware components in the cell, such as the electrolyte and the anode, necessitates a critical discussion of other cell components. Modern in situ characterisation methods are ideally suited to illuminate the role of each component. This article does not pretend to summarise all recently published data, but instead is a critical overview over lithium-sulfur batteries based on recent research findings.

However, their applications are hindered by the poor conductivity of sulfur and capacity fading caused by the shuttle effect. Here, ultrathin manganese dioxide decorated graphene/carbon nanotube nanocomposites are designed as sulfur hosts to suppress the shuttle effect and improve the adsorption efficiency of polysulfides. The graphene/carbon nanotube hybrids, with extraordinary conductivity and large surface area, function as excellent channels for electron transfer and lithium ion diffusion. The ultrathin manganese dioxide nanosheets enable efficient chemical interaction with polysulfides and promote the redox kinetics of polysulfides. As a result, an ultrathin manganese dioxide decorated graphene/carbon nanotube sulfur composite with high sulfur content (81.8 wt%) delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1015.1 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1C, high coulombic efficiency approaching 100% and high capacity retention of 84.1% after 100 cycles. The nanocomposites developed in this work have promising applications in high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this work, polyaniline (PANI) encapsulated amorphous vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowires (general formula V2O5 center dot nH(2)O and abbreviated as VOH) are synthesized by a facile in situ chemical oxidative polymerization method, and utilized as a basic building block for the preparation of functional interlayers on the commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, generating a VOH@PANI-PP separator with multi-functionalities. Compared to the crystalline V2O5, the amorphous V2O5 shows enhanced properties of polysulfide adsorption, catalytic activity, as well as ionic conductivity. Therefore, within the VOH@PANI-PP separator, the amorphous V2O5 nanowire component contributes to the strong adsorption of polysulfides, the high catalytic activity for polysulfides conversion, and the high ionic conductivity. The PANI component further strengthens the above effects, improves the electrical conductivity, and enhances the flexibility of the modified separator. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the VOH@PANI-PP separator effectively suppresses polysulfide shuttling and improves the cycling stability of its composed Li-S batteries. This work provides a new research strategy for the development of efficient separators in rechargeable batteries by judiciously integrating the amorphous metal oxide with a conductive polymer.

In this work, we study anchoring properties of B and N co-doped graphene by using density functional theory computations. Three doping configurations are considered and named as the adjacent (BC6NA), meta (BC6NM) and para (BC6NP) dopping, respectively. BC6NA has the best anchoring performance, as it has a strong absorption energy for the three clusters Li2S4 (1.20 eV), Li2S6 (1.51 eV) and Li2S8 (1.81 eV), while both BC6NM and BC6NP have a relatively worse anchoring performance due to their weak physical adsorption, especially for the Li2S4 cluster. Moreover, after adsorption the conductivity of the BC6NA is enhanced and the dissociation energy of the cluster is reduced, which further improve the performance of LSBs. This indicates that monolayer BC6NA is a promising sulfur host material for LSBs with a good anchoring performance.

Herein, continuous MIL-101(Cr) membranes were successfully fabricated on carbon nanotube films utilizing a simple in situ growth method, aiming at constructing interlayer materials for inhibiting the shuttle effect. Owing to the suitable pore aperture and super electrolyte wettability, the as-developed MIL-101(Cr) membrane can effectively inhibit the shuttle behaviour of polysulfides while allowing the fast transport of Li-ions simultaneously, working as an ionic sieve. Additionally, this MOFs membrane is also helpful in accelerating the polysulfide catalytic conversion. Therefore, the proposed interlayer delivers an extraordinary rate capability, showing a remarkable capacity of 661.9 mAh g(-1) under 5 C. Meanwhile, it also exhibits a high initial capacity of 816.1 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and an exceptional durability with an extremely low capacity fading of 0.046% per cycle over 500 cycles.

However, the dissolution and shutter of polysulfides lead to low active material utilization and fast capacity fading. Electrospinning technology is employed to directly coat an interlayer composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and nitrogen-doped carbon black (NC) fibers on the cathode. Benefiting from electrospinning technology, the PAN-NC fibers "possess good electrolyte infiltration for fast lithium-ion transport and great flexibility for adhering on the cathode. The NC particles provide good affinity for polysufides and great conductivity. Thus, the polysulfides can be trapped on the cathode and reutilized well. As a result, the PAN-NC-coated sulfur cathode (PAN-NC@cathode) exhibits the initial discharge capacity of 1279 mAh g(-1) and maintains the reversible capacity of 1030 mAh g(-1) with capacity fading of 0.05% per cycle at 200 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles. Adopting electrospinning to directly form fibers on the cathode shows a promising application.

To overcome these drawbacks, numerous state-of-the-art encapsulation/wrap of sulfur strategies have been developed. However, most of these methods have challenges to implement in commercializing applications of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a facile and effective sulfur loading method is presented by droping liquid Li2S8 into carbon coated TiO2 nanowire arrays without any complex pre-processing. As a result, these electrodes with 2.0 and 4.0 mg/cm(2) sulfur have high initial capacities of 1280 and 1240 mAh/g, and maintain 930 and 680 mAh/g after 500 cycles under 3.2 mA, respectively. For a quick-acting cycling, it holds 520 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 5.8 mA with 4.0 mg/cm(2) sulfur loading. The facile sulfur loading approach may provide a new opportunity to construct high performance sulfur-based cathodes for their industrial applications.

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides deteriorates its electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel Co9S8 nanostructure derived from metal organic framework material (MOF) was explored by simple liquid phase reaction and heat vulcanization of 2-methylimidazole and Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O on the surface of the original PP separator. The Co9S8 nano-flower cluster array wall was vertically and closely arranged with the thickness of 200 nm, and the polysulfide can be adsorbed by its physical and chemical action to slow down the "shuttle effect". It is found that the cell with the modified separator can achieve an ideal discharge capacity of about 600 mAh/g at 1 C. The specific capacity is maintained at 500 mAh/g after 200 cycles, with only 0.11% of capacity decay per cycle. It provides a new way for the utilization of MOF material derivatives to modify the separator in order to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, non-hierarchical nitrogenous hollow carbon cannot guarantee sufficient contact between sulfur and carbon materials, leading to the slow reaction rate of sulfur and inadequate adsorption of LPS, both of which should occur on the surfaces of the carbon material only. Therefore, it ishighly necessary to synthesize hierarchical hollow nitrogenous carbon via a facile method that is neither difficult nor complex. Herein, we propose a novel method to fabricate nitrogenous hollow carbon spheres filled with porous carbon nanosheets (NHCS-PCS) and prove that using these hierarchical NHCS-PCS as a sulfur host for LSBs is more efficient than using traditional nitrogenous hollow carbon spheres (NHCS). NHCS-PCS with a hierarchical structure can 1) ensure sufficient contact between sulfur and carbon, which occurs as a result of the dispersed distribution of sulfur in the filled porous carbon nanosheets, thus promoting the reaction of sulfur and adequate adsorption of LPS, simultaneously; 2) provide a sufficient number of adsorption sites and enhance the physical entrapment for LPS, because the NHCS-PCS have a higher content of nitrogen and larger specific surface area than the NHCS. Because of these benefits, the NHCS-PCS/sulfur composite cathode exhibits a high sulfur utilization, resulting in a high discharge capacity of 1516 mAh/g at 0.1 C, fast reaction kinetics (1169, 960 and 626 mAh/g at 0.2, 0.5 and 1 C, respectively) and a stable long-term cycling performance (86.5% capacity retention after 250 cycles at 0.5 C, which is equivalent to a decay of 0.054% per cycle). Our work provides a facile method of preparing hollow and hierarchical carbon, which is a promising sulfur host for LSBs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, they also have suf-fered from several scientific and technical issues including low conductivity, polysulfides migration, and volume changes. In this study, CoS2-TiO2@carbon core-shell fibers were fabricated through combination of coaxial electrospinning and selective vulcanization method. The core-shell fibers are able to efficiently host sulfur, confine polysulfides, and accelerate intermediates conversion. This electrode delivers an ini-tial specific capacity of 1181.1 mAh g(-1) and a high capacity of 736.5 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles with high coulombic efficiency over 99.5% (capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle). This strategy of isolating interactant and selective vulcanization provides new ideas for effectively constructing heterostructure materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Scanning electronic microscopy observations showed the formation of irregularly interlaced nanosheet-like structure consisting SSC with uniform sulfur coating on its surface. The SSC nanoflakes in the composite act as nanocurrent collectors, favoring the charge carrier ion transport and electrolyte diffusion. The interlaced SSC nanoflakes irregularly stack together and form a three-dimensional network, which is beneficial for both trapping soluble polysulfide intermediates and rendering the electrical conductivity of the composite electrode. A lithium cell employing this sulfur/stacking sheet-like carbon (S/SSC) composite cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 965 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and retained a capacity of 743 mAh g(-1) over 100 charge-discharge cycles. Even at 3.2 C rate, the lithium cell with the S/SSC composite cathode demonstrated an excellent rate capability, delivering a highly reversible discharge capacity of 418 mAh g(-1).

In order to eliminate the shuttle effect, a layer-by-layer N and P doped heterogeneous carbon materials (MC@CN@CNP) with gradient electric fields are rationally designed to limit the dissolution of polysulfide anions. Such heterogeneous structure is prepared by a simple MOF self-sacrificing template strategy via changing the types of organic ligands in the synthesis of multilayer MOF, thus realizing the gradient doping of N and P heteroatoms from the inner layer to the outer layer. DFT calculation proves that the doping of N and P heteroatoms can change the electronic structure of carbon materials and tune their electron cloud density. The hybrid atom gradient doping also induces the construction of gradient energy level. The gradient of electron cloud density increases to form an internal electric field, which restricts the diffusion of polysulfides to the anode and alleviates the loss of active sulfur caused by shuttle effect. At the same time, the doping of N and P heteroatoms enhances the conductivity of MOF derived carbon, promotes the charge transfer, and enhances the reaction kinetics. As a result, when the MOF derived carbon material (MC@CN@CNP) was used to modify the commercial PP separator, the lithium-sulfur battery shows excellent electrochemical properties with superior rate capability and robust cycling stability (737.2 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0 C with a small capacity decay of 0.034% per cycle).

To solve them effectively, a modularly assembled interlayer was prepared by agglomerating Vulcan XC72 carbon black nanoparticles into ellipsoidal superstructures through a double Fischer esterification reaction. The MAXC interlayer can efficiently trap soluble intermediate polysulfides and provide space to store electrolyte and reaction products. More importantly, it can keep lithium anode compact and stable, enabling prolonged cell cycling. A Li/MAXC-MAXC/Li symmetrical cell sustained stable 180-cycles test and delivered only a 20 mV overpotential with a depositing/stripping capacity of 1 mA h/cm(2) at 1 mA/cm(2). At a high sulfur loading of approximately 5.3 mg/cm(2), Li-S coin cells with the assembled MAXC interlayer maintained a high reversible capacity of 909.0 mAh/g and a high areal capacity of 4.75 mAh/cm(2) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. This multi-functional interlayer affords a viable strategy for the fabrication of high-energy-density batteries with protected metal anodes.

Herein, high-index faceted iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanocrystals anchored on reduced graphene oxide are developed as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts, effectively improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. The theoretical and experimental results all indicate that high-index Fe2O3 crystal facets with abundant unsaturated coordinated Fe sites not only have strong adsorption capacity to anchor polysulfides but also have high catalytic activity to facilitate the redox transformation of polysulfides and reduce the decomposition energy barrier of Li2S. The Li-S batteries with these bifunctional electrocatalysts exhibit high initial capacity of 1521 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and excellent cycling performance with a low capacity fading of 0.025% per cycle during 1600 cycles at 2 C. Even with a high sulfur loading of 9.41 mg cm(-2) , a remarkable areal capacity of 7.61 mAh cm(-2) was maintained after 85 cycles. This work provides a new strategy to improve the catalytic activity of nanocrystals through the crystal facet engineering, deepening the comprehending of facet-dependent activity of catalysts in Li-S chemistry, affording a novel perspective for the design of advanced sulfur electrodes.

A commercial organometallic salt, nickel chloride dimethoxyethane adduct (NiDME), is introduced as the homogenous catalyst dissolved in the electrolyte to suppress the shuttle effect. A very small amount of catalyst (only 0.5 wt% additive relative to the electrolyte) brings the battery capacity a big rise from 408 to 784 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles at 1 C. More promisingly, the required amount of electrolyte is greatly reduced, and the battery works well with a lean electrolyte (5 mu L-(electrolyte)/mg((sulfur))). The improved performance is attributed to the catalyst-accelerated LiPS conversion which is characterized by largely decreased activation energy (E-a) of the sulfur redox reaction, especially for Li2S deposition, and much reduced accumulation of LiPSs intermediates. Specially, the NiDME additive captures LiPSs in the electrolyte, accelerates the redox reactions homogeneously and regulates a uniform and fast deposition of Li2S, all these contributing to a perfect catalytic cycle with less LiPS shuttling. This work deepens our understanding on catalysis in accelerating sulfur redox conversion and indicates homogeneous catalysis as a simple yet fundamental solution to shuttle effect of LiPSs intermediates, which boosts practical Li-S batteries with less electrolyte needs and long working life.

Herein, a self-supported sulfur host is fabricated by an in-situ growth of MoO2/MoS2 nano-sheets on a carbon cloth (CC). First, carbon cloth serves as a good template for the morphology-controlled synthesis of nanostructured materials, which not only alleviates the agglomeration of MoO2/MoS2, but also enhances the flexibility and mechanical strengthen of the hybrid architecture as a free-standing host. Second, the polysulfide-trapping ability can be greatly enhanced by both physical and chemical adsorption from the MoO2/MoS2-anchored carbon cloth. Moreover, the partially sulfurized MoO2/MoS2 nano-sheets integrate the benefits of conductive MoO2 and sulfiphilic MoS2, thus facilitating fast charge transfer and redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion. As a result, these attributes enable the host to hold a high sulfur loading (up to 7.6 mg cm(-2)), which exceeds most of the reported carbon cloth-related cathode work in the literature. Additionally, the Li-S cells can achieve a high peak capacity of 1350 mA h g(-1), excellent rate capability (C/20 - 2C rate), impressive areal capacity (up to 6.3 mA h cm(-2)), and a high capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles.

The composites were characterized and examined by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements, scanning electron microscopy, and electrochemical methods, such as cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. It is found that the mesoporous TiO2 and sulfur particles are uniformly distributed in the composite after a melt-diffusion process. When evaluating the electrochemical properties of as-prepared TiO2-S composite as cathode materials in lithium-sulfur batteries, it exhibits much improved cyclical stability and high rate performance. The results showed that an initial discharge specific capacity of 1,460 mAh/g at 0.2 C and capacity retention ratio of 46.6 % over 100 cycles of composite cathode, which are higher than that of pristine sulfur. The improvements of electrochemical performances were due to the good dispersion of sulfur in the pores of TiO2 particles and the excellent adsorbing effect on polysulfides of TiO2.

A New Graphitic Nitride and Reduced Graphene Oxide-Based Sulfur Cathode for High-Capacity Lithium-Sulfur Cells	ENERGIES			English	Article						Li-S cells; reduced graphene oxide; graphitic nitride; polysulfide shuttle; polysulfide absorbing material; sulfur cathode composite	NITROGEN-DOPED CARBON; COMPOSITE CATHODE; FACILE SYNTHESIS; LONG-LIFE; BATTERIES; POLYSULFIDE; FRAMEWORK; ELECTRODE; NETWORK; NANOPARTICLES	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries can provide at least three times higher energy density than lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries. However, Li-S batteries suffer from a phenomenon called the polysulfide shuttle (PSS) that prevents the commercialization of these batteries. The PSS has several undesirable effects, such as depletion of active materials from the cathode, deleterious reactions between the lithium anode and electrolyte soluble lithium polysulfides, resulting in unfavorable coulombic efficiency, and poor cycle life of the battery. In this study, a new sulfur cathode composed of graphitic nitride as the polysulfide absorbing material and reduced graphene oxide as the conductive carbon host has been synthesized to rectify the problems associated with the PSS effect. This composite cathode design effectively retains lithium polysulfide intermediates within the cathode structure. The S@RGO/GN cathode displayed excellent capacity retention compared to similar RGO-based sulfur cathodes published by other groups by delivering an initial specific capacity of 1415 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C. In addition, the long-term cycling stability was outstanding (capacity decay at the rate of only 0.2% per cycle after 150 cycles).

Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, we systematically exploited the anchoring effects of various titanium carbide-based MXenes for Li-S batteries. Our results revealed that, due to the attraction between Li ions in Li2Sn species and O atoms in Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2 monolayer, the two Mxenes can strongly interact with Li2Sn species with remarkable but not too strong binding strength to effectively immobilize the soluble polysulfides. Especially, the intactness of the Li2Sn species can be well saved, although the Li-S bonds are weakened. Therefore, Ti2CO2 and Ti3C2O2 monolayers are quite promising anchoring materials with good cycling performances for Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Besides, achieving the high performance with low metal loading has practical significance for the commercialization of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, the chainmail catalyst of Fe3O4@C/CNTO was prepared by annealing the iron phthalocyanine (FePc)/oxidized carbon nanotubes (CNTO) precursor in which FePc was used as iron and carbon sources and CNTO was functionalized as oxygen source and catalyst support. The conductive composite catalyst with low metal loading (5.4 wt%) was applied into the coating layer of Celgard separator with duplex functions in trapping and catalyzing intercepted LiPSs for high-performance Li-S batteries. This work can help us to understand the importance of conductive and catalytic composite interface for promotion of LiPSs conversion and also offer a more feasible synthesis method of electrocatalyst for other energy storage systems.

However, the polysulfide shuttle effect, low electronic conductivity of sulfur/lithium sulfides and slow redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion still limit their practical application. Herein, we design a hollow nanosphere structure with CeO2 shell/ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon shell as highly efficient sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries. The unique structure not only offers physical entrapment for sulfur species by CeO2/carbon shells, but also provides strong chemical adsorption and activation sites for chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides through CeO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, the unique hollow structure offers enough space for volume variations of sulfur during charge/discharge process and facilitates fast electron/ion transport to continuously activate active material, therefore improving the electrochemical performances of lithium-sulfur batteries. By combining these advantages, the obtained NC@H-CeO2/S cathodes exhibit high reversible capacity (1348 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), excellent rate capability (548 mAh g(-1) at 5 C) and superior cycle stability (632 and 458 mAh g(-1) at 2 and 5 C after 500 cycles, respectively). Moreover, the cathodes with high sulfur loading of 3.5 mg cm(-2) remain excellent rate capability and cycling stability. This work provides a new strategy to the design of advanced cathode materials for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Three-Dimensional Growth of Li2S in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Promoted by a Redox Mediator	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; redox mediator; electrodeposition; polysulfide; morphology; lithium sulfide	AIR BATTERY; CATHODE MATERIALS; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; ENERGY-STORAGE; ELECTRODE; COMPOSITE; POLYSULFIDES; SPECIATION; REDUCTION; CHEMISTRY	During the discharge of a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, an electronically insulating 2D layer of Li2S is electrodeposited onto the current collector. Once the current collector is enveloped, the overpotential of the cell increases, and its discharge is arrested, often before reaching the full capacity of the active material. Guided by a new computational platform known as the Electrolyte Genome, we advance and apply benzo[ghi]peryleneimide (BPI) as a redox mediator for the reduction of dissolved polysulfides to Li2S. With BPI present, we show that it is now possible to electrodeposit Li2S as porous, 3D deposits onto carbon current collectors during cell discharge. As a result, sulfur utilization improved 220% due to a 6-fold increase in Li2S formation. To understand the growth mechanism, electrodeposition of Li2S was carried out under both galvanostatic and potentiostatic control. The observed kinetics under potentiostatic control were modeled using modified Avrami phase transformation kinetics, which showed that BPI slows the impingement of insulating Li2S islands on carbon. Conceptually, the pairing of conductive carbons with BPI can be viewed as a vascular approach to the design of current collectors for energy storage devices: here, conductive carbon "arteries" dominate long-range electron transport, while BPI "capillaries" mediate short-range transport and electron transfer between the storage materials and the carbon electrode.

Recent studies have shown that the metal (Pt, Au, Ni) as electrocatalyst of lithium polysulfides and its metallic porous nanostructure can suppress the shuttle effect. In this work, we use the porous nanostructure of nickel fibers/sulfur as-designed composite cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries. The initial discharge capacity of the cathode with the added 3(%) nickel fibers was 805 mAh g(-1), and the remaining capacity was 440 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.766 mA cm(-2). Even at a high current density of 1.532 mA cm(-2), it also kept a high discharge capacity of 310 mAh g(-1). Compared with pure sulfur electrodes, the electrodes containing nickel fibers showed an obviously improved cycle and rate performances, confirming that metallic porous nanostructure of nickel can not only contribute to reducing the dissolution of polysulfides into electrolytes, but also has a catalytic effect on the redox reactions during charge-discharge process.

However, the shuttle effect and the resulting self-discharge hinder the commercialization of Li-S batteries. In this study, a facile, inexpensive, and scalable spray-coating method was developed to cover a cathode with carbon nitride film (g-C3N4). Because of the strong adsorption of polysulfides by carbon nitride, the S-GF/C3N4 cathode exhibited a high reversible capacity of 927mAh/g at 0.2C and long cyclic stability of 720mAh/g after 280cycles with a high capacity retention up to 78% with the sulfur loading of 5mg/cm(2). This study presents a new pervasive spray-coating method to facilitate simple and large-scale membrane modification and to enable the practical application of Li-S batteries.

Herein, composites of sulfur and microporous carbon (MSP20, MSC30) are prepared by a melt diffusion process, and their performance as electrode materials are compared with that of composites based on nanocarbons. In addition to the type of carbon, the degree of mixing with solid electrolytes is an important factor in the formation of ionic/electronic conduction pathways. The all-solid-state cell using S-MSC30-Li3PS4 shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1488 mAh per gram of sulfur at 25 degrees C at a current density of 1.3 mA cm(-2) and operates reversibly at a high current density of 12.7 mA cm(-2) (3C) at 100 degrees C. The amorphization of sulfur is effective for obtaining high capacity and sulfur impregnated into the meso- and micropores of carbon is more active than sulfur that forms nanocomposites with nanocarbon.

To a great extent, the significantly changing polarities, conductivities, and solubilities of sulfur species complicate these issues and make them hard to deal with. In this study, a biomimetic bipolar microcapsule is developed via bacteria fermentation and chemical modification. The biomimetic hierarchical microcapsule has a nonpolar core to load active materials and a polar shell to "selectively" control mass transport in and out. Each capsule acts as a microreactor, which adsorbs sulfur with the porous carbon core, retards polysulfide migration with the polar TiO2 shell, and only facilitates lithium ion diffusion through the shell. The advantages of bipolar microcapsules are able to concurrently address S hosting, electron conducting, and polysulfide migration issues in particle scales instead of electrode scales. Because the resulting sulfur cathodes effectively interact with all sulfur species and confine them inside microcapsules, those intractable issues that lead to poor cycling properties are significantly managed. Thus, a high specific capacity and excellent cycling stability are achieved by using this novel structure design.

Herein, multisize CoS2 particles intercalated/coated-montmorillonite (MMT) as an efficient sulfur host is synthesized. As expected, the obtained S/CoS2@MMT cathode achieves an absorption-catalysis synergistic effect through the polar MMT aluminosilicate sheets and the well-dispersed nano-micron CoS2 particles. Furthermore, efficient interlamellar ion pathways and interconnected conductive network are constructed within the composite host due to the intercalation/coating of CoS2 in/on MMT. Therefore, the S/CoS2@MMT cathode achieves an outstanding rate performance up to 5C (similar to 548 mAh g(-1)) and a high cycling stability with low capacity decay of 0.063 and 0.067 % per cycle for 500 cycles at 1C and 2C, respectively. With a higher sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm(-2), the cathode still delivers satisfactory rate and cycling performance. It shows that the CoS2@MMT host has great application prospects in Li-S batteries.

Achieving three-dimensional (3D) growth of Li2S is therefore considered to be necessary, but the available strategies are mainly based on the electrolyte manipulations, which inevitably lead to added complexity of the electrode-electrolyte compatibility and, in particular, instability of the lithium anode. In this work, we have developed a heterogeneous polysulfide mediator composed of discrete Mo5N6 anchored on graphene, which functions on the cathode side, to regulate the deposition mode of Li2S. Mo5N6 can efficiently boost the formation of Li2S as demonstrated by a series of experimental and computational results. More importantly, the discrete distribution of Mo5N6 nucleants on graphene postpones the merging of adjacent Li2S nuclei to promote their isotropic growth. Thus, 3D deposits of Li2S is guided by the heterogeneous mediator. Benefiting from these unique superiorities, Li-S cells with high rate capability of 954 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and long cycle life exceeding 1000 cycles are realized without advanced lithium anode protection.

Herein, we have successfully developed a simple solution-based spray-drying method to fabricate nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon spheres (N-HPCS) with biomass lignin as a carbon precursor and cyanuric acid as a N-dopant and a porogen. The obtained N-HPCS shows a specific surface area of 446.2 m(2) g(-1)and high-level pyrrolic-N doping of 64.13 %. The N-HPCS/S cathode has a high initial discharge capacity of 1535.1 and 1104.0 mA h g(-1)at 0.1 and 1 C, respectively. In addition, the N-HPCS/S electrode exhibits outstanding cycle performance after 1000 cycles at 1 C, with a low capacity decay rate of only 0.041 % per cycle, which is superior to most of the recently reported carbon-based S cathodes. N-doping causes strong Li2Sx-N chemical adhesion in carbon spheres, effectively suppressing the dissolution and "shuttle effect" of the notorious polysulfide of Li-S batteries, in which pyrrolic-N plays a leading role in the capture of polysulfides intermediates. This contribution is of great significance to the exploration of many other structure-property design strategies for ultralong cycle life Li-S energy storage devices.

Besides, the infamous shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and listless redox kinetic limit its practical applications. Here, a "one-for-all" design concept for separator enabled by interfacial engineering is proposed to relieve the bottlenecks. For one thing, porous bacterial cellulose (PBC) membrane with high thermostability (no shrinking at 200 degrees C) and puncture resistance was employed to ensure the battery's safety. For another, a difunctional Ti3C2Tx-SnS2 modified layer could capture LiPSs through lewis-acid interaction and promoted the redox kinetics by catalytically active sites. The symmetric cell with anchoring-electrocatalysis Ti3C2Tx-SnS2-PBC separator infiltrated with the electrolyte delivered an ionic conductivity of 2.171 mS/cm at a high temperature of 180 degrees C. And a capacity retention is improved by 71.2% compared with PP separator. This work furnishes a facial engineering strategy for manufacturing a multifunctional separator for lithium sulfur batteries.

Here we demonstrate a laminated separator which was obtained by coating a layer of tubular nitrogen doped carbon fibre (TNCF) on PP/PE/PP separator with an expect to alleviate such a problem. The hollow structured one-dimensional TNCF was obtained by pyrolyzing the tubular polypyrrole (PPy) which was synthesized through an auto-degradable template method. And the laminated separator was prepared by a simple vacuum-assisted filter method. Due to enhancement of the electrical conductivity and the chemisorption with lithium polysulfides, we observed that the rate performance and the cyclability of the Li-S battery were remarkably enhanced when the TNCF separator was used. The capacity decay rate were determined to be 0.13% and 0.33% per cycle upon 200 cycles at 0.5 C for the Li-S batteries with the TNCF coated and the un-coated separators, respectively. That present the TNCF coated separator a promising high performance separator for long-life Li-S batteries. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The CEM PS absorbent effectively limits the irreversible active material loss from CEM-S cathodes and prevents the formation of severe inactive agglomerations on the surface of the cathode during cycling. In addition to trapping the migrating PSs, the conductive and porous CEM facilitates efficient electron transport and electrolyte immersion, which ensures successive reactivation and reutilization of the trapped active material. As a result, the CEM-S cathodes with a reasonable sulfur content of 60 wt % exhibit a high capacity retention rate of 85% and a low capacity fade rate of 0.10% per cycle for 150 cycles. Such superior cycle stability suggests that natural starting materials with unique porous structures can be utilized to manufacture high-performance cell components for Li-S cells.

Herein, a 2D graphene-based microporous carbon substrate (I-GPC) with a high conductivity and diverse porous structure was designed via an ionothermal method combined with an activation process. The resultant I-GPC has a specific area as high as 1740.1 m(2) g(-1) and a hierarchical microporous structure consisting of both smaller micropores (<0.69 nm) and larger micropores (0.8 and 1.2 nm). The S/I-GPC composite presents an excellent electrochemical performance with a high initial discharge capacity up to 1510 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and an impressive cycling stability of 625.8 mA h g(-1) after 150 cycles at 1C. The remarkable electrochemical performances are primarily attributed to the diverse microporous structure of I-GPC with high conductivity. The ionothermal method and rational design of the carbon material provide us with new opportunities for the development of other energy storage systems.

However, poor conductivity, insufficient adsorption strength and sluggish multi-electron redox reactions restrict LSBs performance. Thus rational design of one-dimensional materials with good conductivity for sulfur, strong adsorption and catalytic abilities to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), is necessary for improving the electrochemical behavior of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we report Fe3C nanorods encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (Fe3C@NCNT) as a promoter for sulfur cathode, in which CNT acting as a conductive network promotes ionic and electronic transfer, while "lithiophilic" heteroatom N immobilizes LiPSs through strong chemical bonding (Li-N bonds), and Fe3C accelerates the adsorption and conversion of LiPSs derived from its catalytic Fe3C site. Therefore, the Fe3C@NCNT as a promoter prolong the life of LSBs with the help of the synergistic effect of polarized N heteroatoms and catalytic effect of Fe3C. As a result, the composite cathode material delivers an outstanding initial capacity of 950 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, and a capacity of 870 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. This work proposes a feasible strategy to immobilize LiPSs and accelerate the conversion of LiPSs in high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To solve this problem, a particular strategy is put up to relieve shuttle effect by capturing soluble polysulfides through a three-dimensional interconnected carbon network. Due to the uniformly anchored ultrafine FeS nanoparticles on a 3D interconnected carbon network, the material could lock soluble polysulfides on the cathode side and promote electrochemical conversion reactions among sulfur species. By optimizing the active site exposure of FeS and designing a hierarchical porous and multichannel structure to ensure rapid migration of ions and electrons at the same time, the interlayer can effectively suppress the shuttle effect and enhance sulfur utilization. Thus, the Li-S battery presents excellent cycling stability and rate capability, namely, a reversible specific capacity of 560 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C over 500 cycles with a decay rate of 0.012% per cycle and a specific capacity of 597 mAh g(-1) at a 5.0 C current rate. This study offers a promising strategy for designing the structure of an interlayer to achieve long-cycle stable Li-S batteries.

However, a series of issues severely limit the practical performances of Li-S batteries such as low conductivity, significant volume change, and shuttle effect. The hollow carbon spheres with huge voids and high electrical conductivity are promising as sulfur hosts. Unfortunately, the nonpolar nature of carbon materials cannot prevent the shuttle effect effectively. In this case, the atomic cobalt is introduced to a nitrogen-doped hollow carbon sphere (ACo@HCS) through polymerization and controlled pyrolysis. The atomic cobalt dopants not only act as active sites to restrict the shuttle effect, but also can promote the kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. ACo@HCS acting as sulfur host exhibits a high discharge capacity (1003 mAh g(-1)) at a 1.0 C rate after 500 cycles, and the corresponding decay rate is as low as 0.002% per cycle. This exciting work paves a new way to design high-performance Li-S batteries.

The built-in hollow catalyst, consists of carbon supported cobalt nanodots (Co-NC) derived from ZIF-67 metal-organic framework, servers as sulfur accommodation and catalytic center for LiPSs trapping and conversion. The Co-NC is wrapped by a thin microporous TpBD-Me-2 COF layer with polar functional groups, providing additional physical and chemical confinement for polysulfides shuttling. With these merits, the cell with S/Co-NC@TpBD-Me-2 cathode exhibits a high initial capacity of 1178.15 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, and average 0.04% decay per cycle at 1C in 500 cycles. The cell also delivers a high rate performance (543.13 mAh g(-1)) up to 5C. Even at raised sulfur loading (5.71 mg cm(-2)) and lean electrolyte condition (E/S ratio 6.10 mu L mg(-1)), a 4.53 mAh cm(-2) high area capacity is achieved after 50 cycles. The Li-S pouch cell also achieves a specific capacity of 860.35 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C after 50 cycles. This COF-confined multifunctional composite design provides an alternative strategy for the fabrication of high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the "shuttle effect" caused by the dissolution of polysulfides in liquid electrolytes severely hinders their practical applications. Herein, we originally propose a carboxyl functional polyamide acid (PAA) nanofiber separator with dual functions for inhibiting polysulfide transfer and promoting Li+ migration via a one-step electrospinning synthesis method. Especially, the functional groups of -COOH in PAA separators provide an electronegative environment, which promotes the transport of Li+ but suppresses the migration of negative polysulfide anions. Therefore, the PAA nanofiber separator can act as an efficient electrostatic shield to restrict the polysulfide on the cathode side, while efficiently promoting Li+ transfer across the separator. As a result, an ultralow decay rate of only 0.12% per cycle is achieved for the PAA nanofiber separator after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, which is less than half that (0.26% per cycle) of the commercial Celgard separator.

Herein a conformal zinc sulfide/reduced graphene oxide/elemental sulfur (ZnS/rGO/S) composite is synthesized and used as cathode materials in Li-S batteries. The synergetic regulation of ohmic, concentration, and electrochemical polarization decreases the overpotential and improves the cycling performance of the Li parallel to ZnS/rGO/S cell. Combining theoretical calculations and experimental results, it is revealed that the ZnS spheres can absorb lithium polysulfide (LPS) intermediates, catalyze LPS conversion, and provide fast electronic/ionic diffusion kinetics. The ZnS/rGO/S cathode is further applied in pouch Li-S cells, demonstrating the practicability of sulfur cathodes with reduced polarization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To overcome these problems, an effective encapsulation for the sulfur cathode is necessary. By means of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and density functional theory (DFT), we have predicted a stable metallic two-dimensional sp2-hybridized carbon allotrope (DHP-graphene). This carbon sheet can prevent S atoms from cathode entering electrolyte. However, Li-ions can shuttle freely due to the increasing difference in Li-ions concentration between electrolyte and cathode along with the potential difference between cathode and anode during charge-discharge cycles. In addition, versatile electronic band structures and linear dispersion are found in DHP-graphene nanoribbons but only metallic band structure occurs for DHP-graphene nanotubes.

In this work, we used phosphorus-doped graphitic carbon nitride (xP-g-C3N4) as a sulfur host material for the first time. xP-g-C3N4 was prepared with dicyandiamide as the precursor and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate as a phosphorus source. The effect of phosphorus doping on the electrochemical properties of xP-g-C3N4/S as cathode material for the Li-S battery was studied. The results show that decreasing lattice spacing improves the conductivity by doping phosphorus, and the specific surface area of 0.1P-g-C3N4 reaches 19.66 m(2) g(-1), which is about two times higher than that of g-C3N4. 0.1P-g-C3N4/S has 1344 mAh g(-1) for the initial discharge specific capacity and 882 mAh g(-1) for reversible specific capacity after 100 cycles with a capacity decay of 0.34% per cycle, exhibiting outstanding cycling performance and rate performance. Phosphorus-doped materials have a high specific capacity due to their own stronger physical adsorption and chemisorption of polysulfides and higher conductivity. This doping strategy proposed a new and efficient pathway for the fabrication of high-performance sulfur electrodes for Li-S batteries.

However, poor electrical conductivity of sulfur and poor cycle stability of the battery hinder its application. Here, we report that graphene microsheets prepared from microcrystalline graphite minerals by an electrochemical & mechanical approach work as a special conductive support to load sulfur as the cathode of lithium-sulfur battery.

However, the shuttle of polysulfides and their sluggish kinetic conversion in electrochemical processes seriously reduce the utilization of active sulfur, leading to a rapid capacity fading. Herein we introduced indium nitride (InN) nanowires into Li-S batteries through separator modification. Both the indium cation and electron-rich nitrogen atom of InN served as the polysulfide traps through strong chemical affinity. Meanwhile, the rapid electron transfer on the surface of InN accelerated the conversion of polysulfides in a working battery. The bifunction of InN nanowires effectively suppressed the shuttle effect. Therefore, Li-S batteries with InN-modified separators exhibit excellent rate performance and high stable cycling life with only 0.015% capacity decay per cycle after 1000 cycles, which affords fresh insights into the energy chemistry of high-stable Li-S batteries.

Nevertheless, as an effective strategy, most modified separators cannot block and reuse polysulfides simultaneously. Here, a unique and versatile film fabricated by nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped carbon nanofibers uniformly anchored with TiC nanoparticles is incorporated between the separator and cathode of the lithium-sulfur battery. The battery armed with this functional film exhibits a high capacity of 737.1 mA h g(-1) at 5 C with a slow capacity-fading rate of 0.06%/cycle over 500 cycles. Even when augmenting the sulfur loading to 17.1 mg cm(-2), it can achieve a capacity of 837.3 mA h g(-1) with a retention of similar to 80% after 50 cycles. The TiC nanoparticles as well as heteroatom doping in the porous carbon nanofiber exhibit strong physiochemical adsorption and catalytic effect, which is proven by experiments and theoretical calculations. Thus, the diffusion of polysulfides can be effectively inhibited. Meanwhile, heteroatom doping can further enhance the conductivity and reaction activity of this film. Hence, the adsorbed polysulfides could be revived and renewed during the subsequent cycling process, which is accurately observed and confirmed by experiments for the first time.

Nevertheless, the low sulfur utilization and the severe "shuttle effect" impede the commercialization of them. Herein, a phosphorus doped carbonized cotton cloth (PCCC) interlayer is proposed to handle these problems. The PCCC interlayer can not only act as an upper current collector and a physical lithium polysulfides (LIPS) barrier due to its high conductivity and knitted structure, but also chemically adsorb the LIPS and catalyze their conversion owing to the heteroatom doping of phosphorus. The synergistic effects of immobilizing and converting the LIPS lead to greatly reduced "shuttle effect" and high sulfur utilization. As a consequence, the Li-S batteries with the PCCC interlayer demonstrate decent cycling performance as well as ultrahigh rate capability by releasing a high initial discharge capacity of 1138 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C with a small capacity fading rate of 0.054% per cycle, and achieving an astonishing discharge capacity up to 642 mA h g(-1) at 10 C.

Nanostructured TiN particles and tube arrays mechanically mixed with graphene substrate leads to the formation of a porous, stabilized composite structure with enhanced electrical conductivity. Such a framework may facilitate accessibility of electrolyte and fast transfer of charges. The specific capacities of the Li-S batteries with TiN nanotubes/graphene and TiN nanoparticles/graphene composites are 1229 and 1085mAhg(-1), respectively, after 180 cycles under a 0.1C rate, which are significantly better than pure TiN nanostructures. The specific capacity and capacity retention were investigated as a function of the TiN nanotube to graphene ratio. The optimal ratio was found to be 1:1 TiN/graphene, with the highest capacity retention of 87.5% after 180 cycles. This 3D hybrid structure may provide a balance of high specific capacity and electrochemical stability, allowing durable and efficient energy storage and conversion over a long cycle life.

Herein, the AlF3 coating, prepared via a facile solution-based method, is used as sulfur immobilizers in cathodes for Li-S batteries for the first time. The physical confinement, chemical anchoring and catalysis conversion for polysulfide are achieved simultaneously through the existence of the AlF3 coating, which is confirmed by experimental results. Meanwhile, the CNTs improved the electrical conductivity of composite materials significantly, and a suitable three-dimensional conductive framework was formed to accommodate sulfur. Due to these merits, the asdesigned composite materials of carbon nanotubes-sulfur coating by aluminum fluoride (CNTs-S@AlF3) cathode exhibited excellent electrochemical properties and stable capacity retention. The initial discharge capacity reaches 1144.1 mAh g(-1) and after 250 cycles is 783 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, which is much higher than the composite materials of without AlF3 coating. Moreover, the CNTs-S@AlF3 cathode presents excellent long-term capacity stability with a capacity decay of 0.062% per cycle during 1000 cycles at 0.5 C, offering a potentiality for use in high energy Li-S batteries.

We ascribe the high performance of the S-rGO paper to stable macroporous structure and strong interaction between sulfur nanoparticles and graphene. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Self-diffusion coefficients, conductivity, and lithium transport number of the electrolyte are obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Interface stability, lithium stripping/deposition ability, and the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte are determined by voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The tests suggest conductivity higher than 10(-2) S cm(-1), lithium transport number of about 0.5, electrochemical stability extending from 0 V to 4.6 V, and excellent compatibility with lithium metal. A composite cathode using sulfur and multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is characterized in terms of structure and morphology by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The study shows spherical flakes in which the carbon nanotubes protect the crystalline sulfur from excessive dissolution, and create the optimal host for allowing the proper cell operation. The Li/S cell reveals highly reversible process during charge/discharge cycles, fast kinetic, and lithium diffusion coefficient in the sulfur electrode ranging from 10(-12) to 10(-10) cm(2) s(-1). The cell evidences a coulombic efficiency approaching 100%, capacity from 1300 mAh g(-1) to 900 mAh g(-1) and practical energy density higher than 400 Wh kg(-1).

Herein, a typical Co@NC heterostructure composed of Co nanoparticles and a semiconductive N-doped carbon matrix is designed as a model Mott-Schottky catalyst to exert the electrocatalytic effect on sulfur electrochemistry. Theoretical and experimental results reveal the redistribution of charge and a built-in electric field at the Co@NC heterointerface, which are critical to lowering the energy barrier of polysulfide reduction and Li2S oxidation in the discharge and charge process, respectively. With Co@NC Mott-Schottky catalysts, the Li-S batteries display an ultrahigh capacity retention of 92.1% and a system-level gravimetric energy density of 307.8 Wh kg(-1) under high S loading (10.73 mg cm(-2)) and lean electrolyte (E/S = 5.9 mu L mg(sulfur)(-1)) conditions. The proposed Mott-Schottky heterostructure not only deepens the understanding of the electrocatalytic effect in Li-S chemistry but also inspires a rational catalyst design for advanced high-energy-density batteries.

Li2S cathode has lower volume expansion and higher thermal stability than the traditional sulfur cathode. However, the problems of "shuttle effect" and poor electrical conductivity of the cathode material still need to be overcome. In this work, multi-layered Ti3C2/Li2S (ML-Ti3C2/Li2S) composite has been prepared and applied as a cathode in advanced Li-S batteries. The unique multi-layer sheet structure of Ti3C2 provides space for the storage of Li2S, and its good conductivity greatly enhances the usage ratio of Li2S and improves the conductivity of the whole Li2S cathode. Compared with commonly used graphene, ML-Ti3C2 can trap polysulfides effectively by chemical adsorption and also activate the reaction of Li2S to polysulfides by forming Ti-S bond. As a result, during the cycling of the batteries with ML-Ti3C2/Li2S cathodes, the activation voltage barrier of the first cycle has decreased to 2.8 V, and the "shuttle effect" has been suppressed effectively. The cycling and rate performances of the ML-Ti3C2/Li2S cathodes have been significantly improved compared to that of graphene/Li2S cathodes. They maintain a capacity of 450 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles, and deliver attractive rate performances of 750, 630, 540, 470 and 360mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, and 2 C, respectively.

The asymmetric single-sided PI-PD separator is achieved by in-situ self-polymerization. According to testing, batteries obtain the best performances when PD loading is 0.8 mg cm(-2). Li-S battery with PD as a separator coating shows excellent electrochemical performance and high security. At 0.5C, battery with PI-PD obtains an initial discharge specific capacity of 1404.7 mAh g(-1), and it can be retained at 890.5 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. A high specific capacity of 710 mAh g(-1) is obtained at 5 C. The PD modified layer possesses abundant N, O-containing functional groups which has strong chemical adsorption with the polysulfides. At the same time, the PD layer formed on PI is a dense layer which can be used as a physical barrier. That means polysulfides can be effectively suppressed by both chemical adsorption and physical obstruct in batteries with PI-PD separators. Besides, the PI-PD separator improves the safety of battery because the thoroughly thermal runaway temperature of battery with PI-PD can be as high as 300 degrees C. Therefore, the introduction of PD as a material for coated separator is a promising method using in Li-S battery.

Here we report a simple, low-cost, and scalable method to prepare an additive-free nanocomposite cathode in which sulfur nanoparticles are wrapped inside the NG sheets (S@NG). We show that the Li/S@NG can deliver high specific discharge capacities at high rates, that is, similar to 1167 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, similar to 1058 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, similar to 971 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, similar to 802 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, and similar to 606 mAh g(-1) at 5 C. The cells also demonstrate an ultralong cycle life exceeding 2000 cycles and an extremely low capacity-decay rate (0.028% per cycle), which is among the best performance demonstrated so far for Li/S cells. Furthermore, the S@NG cathode can be cycled with an excellent Coulombic efficiency of above 97% after 2000 cycles. With a high active S content (6096) in the total electrode weight, the S@NG cathode could provide a specific energy that is competitive to the state-of-the-art Li-ion cells even after 2000 cycles. The X-ray spectroscopic analysis and ab initio calculation results indicate that the excellent performance can be attributed to the well-restored C C lattice and the unique lithium polysulfide binding capability of the N functional groups in the NG sheets. The results indicate that the S@NG nanocomposite based Li/S cells have a great potential to replace the current Li-ion batteries.

Successful encapsulation by the polymer was confirmed by microscopic analyses. The encapsulated sulfur electrodes exhibit stable cycling performance and high sulfur utilization; in particular, the cell with 1 wt% dual conducting polymer-coated sulfur particles exhibit the best cycle performance with a discharge capacity of 1002 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C-rate. As opposed to various sulfur-carbon composites reported previously, our 1 wt% dual conducting polymer-coated sulfur composite achieves a very high loading level of 99%. This simple strategy of encapsulating sulfur particles with functional polymers could be a potential pathway toward the commercialization of Li-S batteries. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Scanning electron microscope observation shows that the hollow sulfur sphere is coated by the homogeneous graphene oxide nanolayer, and thermogravimetric analysis demonstrates the composite holds sulfur loading as high as 92 wt%. The composite served as cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries shows its capacity as high as 745 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C after 20 cycles. It also has an excellent cycling stability even at a high current density of 1C (73% retention and 96% coulombic efficiency after 150 cycles), implying that the diffusion of the polysulfides into electrolyte can be greatly inhibited.

This synthesis is done via a facile and large-scalable spray-drying process, and the CeO2/RGO materials are hydrothermally compounded with sulfur. The morphology, composition, structure, and electrochemical properties of the 3D S/CeO2/RGO composite are studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc. The electrochemical performance of the composites as electrodes for lithium-sulfur batteries is evaluated. The S/CeO2/RGO composites deliver a high initial capacity of 1054 mAh g(-1), and retain a reversible capacity of 792 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C. Profiting from the combined effect of CeO2 and RGO, the CeO2/RGO materials effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides, and the coating of spherical RGO improves the structural stability as well as conductivity.

However, the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfide result in a rapid capacity degeneration, which hinders their practical application. Here, poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)-based core-shell structured nanofibers, poly(pyrrole)@poly(ionic liquid)-polyacrylonitrile (PPy@PIL-PAN), were prepared via electrospinning and followed by a surface polymerization of pyrrole. The as-prepared PPy@PIL-PAN nanofibers were implemented as a functional interlayer for Li-S batteries, and it is found that the cationic poly(ionic liquid) framework could selectively adsorb polysulfide species in the electrolytes, contributing to effective shuttle inhibition as well as stable sulfur electrochemistry. Moreover, this work sheds light on an efficient approach to improving the performance of Li-S batteries by using PIL-based functional interlayers.

Here, a facile hydrothermal method is reported to control the synthesis of VOx hollow nanospheres (VHS) of different sizes. The sulfur-loaded VHSs are further mixed with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to obtain a flexible binder-free composite. SWCNTs intertwine around the VOx nanospheres and form an interconnective network to provide conductivity and structural integrity, whereas the small VOx nanospheres offer strong confinement and excellent adsorption ability for polysulfides, thus yielding good cyclability. Results illustrate that VHS with diameters of approximate to 200 nm (VHS-200) show an outstanding capacity of 1069 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, which is higher than that of VHS with diameters of approximate to 400 and 900 nm (VHS-400 and VHS-900). Notably, the electrode shows rate performance of 614 mAh g(-1) at a high current rate of 20 C. Finally, the assembled flexible Li-S batteries show good bending and cycling stabilities in various bending angles, which is promising for potential applications in flexible electronics.

Nevertheless, the low conductivity of sulfur and polysulfide shuttle results in low rate capability and rapid capacity decay, which seriously limit its commercial application. Here, facile, sustainable and cost-effective strategy for preparing heteroatom-doped porous activated carbon (PAC) derived from biomass palm kernel shell (PKS) was developed for high-performance LSB applications. The presence of N, P and S heteroatoms with modification of the surface polarity brings about large amounts of active sites and improved adsorption property compared to those of common carbon materials. The PAC sample possesses desirable specific surface area (SSA) (2760 m(2)center dot g(-1)) as well as pore volume (1.6 cm(3)center dot g(-1)). Besides, the good electrical conductivity of PAC endows the material with excellent rate performance. The PAC-S electrode with a 60% of sulfur loading has a desirable first discharge capacity (1045 mAh center dot g(1), 200 mA center dot g(-1)) with superb discharge capacity (869.8 mAh center dot g(-1), 100th cycle) and cyclability (312.6 mAh center dot g(-1), 800 mA center dot g(-1), 1000th cycle), which can be mainly ascribed to its unique porous properties and the good conductivity of PAC.

Herein, we propose a multifunctional freestanding three-dimensional (3D) bicontinuous heterofibrous carbon nanotube-carbon nanofiber (CNTs-CNFs) scaffold via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy as a polysulfide-engulfing system and a conductive network in the cathode. CNFs construct a continuous network that serves as a freestanding substrate with moderate conductivity for CNTs to grow. The as-grown CNTs with cross-twisted root and cross-winding tips reduce the interfacial impedance of sulfur, achieving up to 77.88% loading. They also act as inserted networks with excellent electrical conductivity in active substance, which facilitate the diffusion and transport of electrons and ions and accelerate redox kinetics, with the initial discharge capacity of 1412.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 C. Moreover, the cross-winding of CNT tips in different spatial orientations plays a great role as well in immobilizing the shuttle of soluble LiPSs via the synergistic effect of physical blocking and chemical adsorption. Eventually, the cycle performance is significantly improved with the maintained capacity of 607.7 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 C.

Synthesis and Electrochemical Performance of PEG-MnO2-Sulfur Composites Cathode Materials for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Li-S Battery; Cathode; PEG Doping	LI-S BATTERIES; GRAPHENE OXIDE; RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES; IMPROVEMENT; PARTICLES; COATINGS; CELLS	Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been achieved great attention in recent years owing to its high theoretical capacity (1675 mAh/g) and energy density (2600 Wh/kg). PEG embedded MnO2/Sulfur composite was prepared via solid state reaction method. The composite was characterized by Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometer. MnO2 effectively suppress the diffusion of polysulfides and add a mechanical strength to the electrode. PEG binds the MnO2 and S, resulting in the minimization of active material loss and improves the electrochemical performance in lithium sulfur batteries. The PEG/MnO2/Sulfur composite exhibits discharge capacity of 647 mAh/g even after 30 cycles with appreciable sustainability. Therefore, the resulting PEG/MnO2/Sulfur composite exhibited as a desirable cathode material for Li-S battery.

The results of the TEM and XRD measurements reveal that S-coated-MWCNTs have a typical core-shell structure, and the MWCNTs serve as the cores and are dispersed individually into the sulfur matrices. The charge-discharge experiments of the lithium/sulfur cells demonstrated that the S-coated-MWCNTs cathode could maintain a reversible capacity of 670 mAh g(-1) after 60 cycles, showing a greatly enhanced cycle ability as compared with the sulfur cathode with simple MWCNTs addition (S/MWCNTs) and the cathode using sulfur-coated carbon black composite (S-coated-CB). The EIS and SEM techniques were used to define and understand the impact of the rnicrostructure of the composite electrode on its electrochemical performance. Derived from these studies, the main key factors to the improvement in the cycle life of the sulfur cathode were discussed. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the shuttle effect, which is caused by the intermediate lithium polysulfide (LiPs) dissolving in the electrolyte and commuting between electrodes, is the main factor leading to the deterioration of the electrochemical performance of the Li-S batteries. Different from most single physical confinement or chemical adsorption, we report a hydrogen ion intercalated molybdenum trioxide (MoO3-HI) with embedded molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) flexible paper as S hosts not only restricted soluble LiPs passively with physical adsorption, but also accelerate actively the transformation rate of polysulfides with strong chemical affinity and catalytic activity. Furthermore, the theoretical calculation showed that the MoO3-HI/MoS2 equipped the ability of directly convert S-8 molecules into LiS2 molecules, eliminating the formation of lithium polysulfide. Based on the new strategy of synergistic suppress shuttle effect, the Li-S battery with MoO3-HI/MoS2/S cathode achieved a capacity of 911.3 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with outstanding cycle stability. In addition, MoO3-HI/MoS2 paper as a flexible carrier for Li-S batteries can be folded repeatedly and keep the structure intact. Hence, the current work provides a novel paper electrode with active and passive dual synergistic inhibition of shuttle effect characteristics for high performance flexible lithium-sulfur batteries.

Improved cycling stability is obtained by using fluoro-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a separator between the sulfur cathode and the lithium anode. The thickness of the hydrophobic interlayer is found to be 1-2 mu m. The possible mechanism is checked with analytical techniques and suggests that improvement in the capacity stability can be attributed to the reduced reactivity of long-chain polysulfides with the metallic lithium and to the homogenous distribution of end discharge products during cycling. The importance of the effective separation of lithium and sulfur is proven by using commercially available lithium conductive ceramics. Good cycling stability over 350 cycles with a coulombic efficiency above 99.95% is achieved, which demonstrates the possibility of long cycle life with proper separation of lithium and sulfur cathode.

However, it is still limited to grant specified functions to each component and integrate into a cell to achieve a synergistic effect for high performance. This paper presents a function convertible synthetic platform based on metal-organic crystal derived from the liquid-solid interfacial reaction, which prepares distinct nanostructured materials with each desired function for the separator and cathode in Li?S batteries. This approach yields carbon nanorods decorated with zinc oxide quantum dots (ZQDs) on a separator, which provides both functions of alleviating the shuttle phenomenon and facilitating the conversion reactions. Further increase in temperature produces a mesostructured carbon nanorod with open porosity, supplying abundant electrochemical reaction sites for sulfur and polysulfide as a sulfur host material for the cathode. Combining specialized functions for the separator and cathode, the resulting cell exhibits outstanding rate capability and cycling performance (579.3 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and 682.9 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 400 cycles).

High-resolution transmission and scanning electronic microscopy observations revealed the formation of a highly porous structure consisting of sulfur with uniform graphene oxide coating on its surface. The resulting sulfur/graphene oxide (S/GO) composite exhibited high and stable specific discharge capacities of 591 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C and good rate capability. This enhanced electrochemical performance could be attributed to the effective confining the polysulfides dissolution and accommodation of the volume changes during the Li-S electrochemical reaction by the functional groups on the graphene oxide coating layer. Furthermore, the highly developed porous structure of S/GO composite favors the enhanced ion transport and electrolyte diffusion.

This phenomenon was verified by X-ray absorption near edge structure technique. The results indicated that copper can be oxidized to CuS by Li2Sx (x >= 6), and a mixture of Cu2S and CuS was obtained when x ranges from 3 to 6. While Cu2S is eventually formed in the presence of Li2S3. After several cycles activation, the polysulfide-shuttle effect and self-discharge phenomenon which hinder the application of lithium sulfur batteries are found nearly eliminated Further experiments demonstrated that in the case of Cu2S generation, a high specific sulfur capacity of 1300 mAh g(-1) could be delivered, corresponding to 77.6% sulfur utilization, while the Coulombic efficiency approximates around 100%. Self-discharge experiment further demonstrated that polysulfides almost disappear in the electrolyte, which verified the polysulfide-capture capability of copper.

In this work, graphene oxide (GO) coated covalent organic framework (COF) compound materials were synthesized as sulfur host material in spray-drying process. The polar groups on COF can efficiently adsorb LiPSs through lithiophilic interaction, which can reduce the 'shuttle effect' caused by soluble LiPSs. Besides, GO in the outer layer can wrap discrete sulfur to reduce the loss of active substances, which further improves the cycle stability of the cathode. The COF@GO/S cathode exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 848.4 mAh g(-1) and retains a capacity of 601.1 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C counting with a low capacity fading of 0.058% per cycle.

Herein, amorphous cobalt phosphide grown on a reduced graphene oxide-multiwalled carbon nanotube (rGO-CNT-CoP(A)) is designed as the sulfur host to conquer the above bottlenecks. The differences between amorphous cobalt phosphide (CoP) and crystalline CoP on the surface adsorption as well as conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are investigated by systematical experiments and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, the amorphous CoP not only strengthens the chemical adsorption to LiPSs but also greatly accelerates liquid-phase conversions of LiPSs as well as the nucleation and growth of Li2S. DFT calculation reveals that the amorphous CoP possesses higher binding energies and lower diffusion energy barriers for LiPSs. In addition, the amorphous CoP features reduced energy gap and the increased electronic concentrations of adsorbed LiPSs near Fermi level. These characteristics contribute to the enhanced chemisorption ability and the accelerated redox kinetics. Simultaneously, the prepared S/rGO-CNT-CoP(A) electrode delivers an impressive initial capacity of 872 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and 617 mAh g(-1) can be obtained after 200 cycles, exhibiting excellent cycling stability. Especially, it achieves outstanding electrochemical performance even under high sulfur loading (5.3 mg cm(-2)) and lean electrolyte (E/S = 7 mu L-E mg(s)(-1)) conditions. This work exploits the application potential for amorphous materials and contributes to the development of highly efficient Li-S batteries.

This issue becomes more severe in capacity-type lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. High-concentration or localized high-concentration electrolytes are noted as effective strategies to stabilize Li metal but usually lead to a high electrolyte density (>1.4 g mL(-1)). Here we propose a bifunctional fluorinated silane-based electrolyte with a low density of 1.0 g mL(-1) that not only is much lighter than conventional electrolytes (approximate to 1.2 g mL(-1)) but also form a robust solid electrolyte interface to minimize Li depletion. Therefore, the Li loss rate is reduced over 4.5-fold with the proposed electrolyte relative to its conventional counterpart. When paired with onefold excess LMA at the electrolyte weight/cell capacity (E/C) ratio of 4.5 g Ah(-1), the Li-S pouch cell using our electrolyte can survive for 103 cycles, much longer than with the conventional electrolyte (38 cycles). This demonstrates that our electrolyte not only reduces the E/C ratio but also enhances the cyclic stability of Li-S batteries under limited Li amounts.

This paper focuses on the electrochemical changes in the interface between cathode and electrolyte, via the surface modification of CNTs@S composites by different types of surfactant. And the cause of this phenomenon is speculated through some comparative experiments. We find that the surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the CNTs@S produce two effects in opposite directions on the interface between cathode and electrolyte: On the one hand, interaction between the hydrophilic group of surfactant and the electrolyte reducing the charge transfer impedance and improving the electrochemical reaction rate; On the other hand, the contact between the hydrophobic group of surfactant and CNTs@S leads a new impedance creating. If these two opposite effects are properly controlled, the battery impedance can be substantially reduced. Finally, with the CNTs@S cathode modified by APG, the charge transfer impedance decreased from 127.2 omega & nbsp;to about 6.3 & UOmega;, even with the newly generated contact impedance, the total impedance is approximately 1/9 of the original. This change increases the maximum charge and discharge current density of the CNTs@S battery from 1 C to 7 C. Even both with a high sulfur loading of 5.3 mg cm(-2 )and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 4.1 mL g(-1), the Li-S batteries with CNTs@S cathode modified by APG still deliver a high capacity of 2.38 mAh cm(-2 ) (66% of initial capacity) after 50 cycles. Moreover, this simple modification strategy is suitable in different carbon-sulfur composites to improve the high current density charge and the discharge performance of Li-S batteries. It brings a new mentality to the industrial application of Li-S batteries. (C0 & nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur and notorious shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) lead to severe loss of active sulfur, poor redox kinetics, and rapid capacity fade. Herein, a hierarchical electrode design is proposed to address these issues synchronously, which integrates multiple building blocks with specialized functions into an ensemble to construct a self-supported versatile cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. Nickel foam acts as a robust conductive scaffold. The heteroatom-doped host carbon with desired lithiophilicity and electronic conductivity serving as a reservoir for loading sulfur can trap LiPSs and promote electron transfer to interfacial adsorbed LiPSs and Ni3S2 sites. The sulfurized carbon nanofiber forest can facilitate the Li-ion and electron transport and retard the LiPSs diffusion as a barrier layer. Sulfiphilic Ni3S2 acts as both a chemical anchor with strong adsorption affinity to LiPSs and an efficient electrocatalyst for accelerating kinetics for redox conversion reactions. Synergistically, all functional units promote the lithium ion coupled electron transfer for binding and redox conversion of LiPSs, resulting in high reversible capacities, remarkable cycle stability, and excellent rate capability.

The design of functional interlayers is one of the effective solutions to overcome this defect. In this work, titanium molybdenum nitride (TMN) solid solution nanoparticles have been successfully decorated on electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to form a continuous flexible TMN@CNF membrane through a one-step calcination process under NH3 atmosphere. By regulating the mass ratio of titanium acetylacetonate TiO(acac)(2) and molybdenum acetylacetonate MoO2(acac)(2), the dissolved amount of Mo into TiN can be precisely controlled. Through the visible adsorption test, cyclic voltammetry test of Li2S6-based symmetric cells, and potentiostatic discharge measurement, such a TMN@CNF membrane has been confirmed to exhibit excellent adsorption and catalytic capacity on lithium polysulfides. With the help of DFT calculations, the adsorption capacity of TMN phase is confirmed to be greatly enhanced when compared with that of TiN, which can be attributed to the improved overlap of the electronic state after the introduction of Mo to TiN. By using such a membrane as the interlayer in Li-S batteries, it can effectively increase the cell's initial capacity to 1205 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C when the dissolved amount of Mo reaches 50%. At the current density of 2 C, the discharge capacity of the cell by using such a multifunctional interlayer can reach up to 947 mA h g(-1) and remains at 390 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles, corresponding to a 0.059% capacity decay per cycle. This work provides a feasible method to prepare a flexible interlayer with a regulated electronic fine structure and strong chemisorption and catalytic ability for the development of the high performance Li-S batteries.

However, their practical implementation has still been handicapped due to notorious lithium polysulfide (LIPS) shuttle and depressed sulfur redox kinetics. It is therefore desirable to exploit key mediators synergizing electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity for the cathode. Herein, we report the employment of atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition to harness the efficient and controllable synthesis of metallic VTe2 over particulated MgO substrates, which has scarcely been demonstrated by conventional wet-chemical synthetic routes thus far. The thus-derived VTe2@MgO heterostructure as an efficient promotor enables effective regulation of LiPSs with respect to polysulfide capture/conversion and Li2S decomposition. As a result, a S/VTe2@MgO cathode with a sulfur loading of 1.6 mg cm(-2) harvests long-term cyclability with a negligible capacity decay of 0.055% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. Even at a sulfur loading of 6.9 mg cm(-2), the cathode still delivers electrochemical performances that can rival the state-of-the-art high-loading counterparts. Our work might offer a feasible solution for developing heterostructured promotors with multifunctionality and electrocatalytic activity for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the low sulfur loading, shuttling effect in electrolyte, and poor cycling stability limit their applications. Herein, molybdenum carbide nanocrystals embedded carbon nanofibers (Mo2C@CFs: MCCFs) hybrid membrane was prepared in situ on CFs membrane based on carbonthermal reduction of ammonium molybdate. The fibrous MCCFs network is used as the current collector with Li(2)S(6)catholyte solution for Li-S batteries, which inhibits the shuttle effect and accelerates kinetics redox reaction. In addition, Mo2C, as electrocatalyst, promotes nucleation of Li2S of the MCCFs substance, which can reduce polarization and increase the specific capacity. As a result, the free-standing MCCFs@Li(2)S(6)electrode (sulfur loading: 4.74 mg) shows a capacity of 977 mAh g(-1)and maintains at 828 mAh g(-1)at 0.2 C over 250 cycles, and indicates excellent reversibility and cycling stability. Even with sulfur loading as high as 7.11 mg, the MCCF@Li(2)S(6)electrode exhibits an extremely high capacity of 5.75 mAh. Meanwhile, the Mo2C modified CFs can be effectively retarding the self-discharge behavior by trapping the polysulfides. Furthermore, the stability improvement of lithium anode state by effectively suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfide, played an important role in enhancing the electrochemical performance.

Herein, a self-standing and flexible PPyprGO/CNTs (PCG) paper as sulfur host is constructed by integrating multiwalled carbon nanotubes into polypyrrolepreduced graphene oxide hybrid structure, rooted from in situ redox reaction and spontaneous assembly of pyrrole and graphene oxide. The three-dimensional (3D) corrugated papery frameworks with carbon nanotube (CNT) pillars deliver a highly conducting pathway for electron and ion transfer. Theoretical calculations indicate that ample nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functional groups can form strong polar-polar interaction with lithium polysulfides. Thus, the assembled lightweight PCG-S electrode exhibits a high gravimetric capacity of 1201.9 mA h g(-1) and retains 727.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 450 cycles, remarkable rate performance, and excellent cyclic stability with an ultralow decay rate of 0.044% per cycle during 200 cycles at 1 C. Delightedly, thanks to its unique structure, the volumetric sulfur loading amount in the flexible electrode can reach ca. 0.82 g cm(-1), which endows the cathode with an ultrahigh volumetric capacity of 975 A h L-1 at 0.2 C simultaneously. This dense monolithic paper appears to be a scalable potential for developing high-performance cathodes in emerging flexible devices.

The HPNACNTs have abundant micropores, mesopores and macropores with a relatively high specific surface area and a large total pore volume. The sulfur-HPNACNTs composite is synthesized for lithium-sulfur batteries by a melt diffusion of sulfur powders into HPNACNTs scaffolds. Electrochemical tests reveal that the sulfur-HPNACNTs (68.8 wt% sulfur) composite exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1340 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and retains as high as 979 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 200 cycles. More importantly, it shows high reversible capacity at high rates (817 mAh g(-1) at 5 C). Its enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the excellent electrical conductivity of aligned carbon nanotubes, the synergetic effect of its hierarchical porosity and the restraint of the shuttle effect due to the SxLi ...

Carbon-based materials take an important role as a host for sulfur in the cathode. In this paper, a nitrogen-doped hollow carbon for sulfur cathode (NHC-S) with high sulfur loading of 92% is studied for Li-S batteries. The structural characterization demonstrates that the N-doping can improve the graphitization of the hollow carbon material, which increases the electrical conductivity. The catalytic and deposition nucleation tests indicate that the N doping can increase the nucleation rate of Li2S, which is also illustrated by the larger binding energies of Li2S on N-doping substrates than on carbon via density functional theory (DFT) analysis. The initial specific capacity of NHC-S is 864.8 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 0.2 C, and 460.8 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles. When the sulfur content loading was up to 2.8 mg cm(-2), the electrode material could achieve 85% capacity retention after 100 reversible cycles.

However, there are still some drawbacks, in which the shuttling of soluble polysulfides in the charge and discharge process severely limits its practical application. Herein, new 3D interconnected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded with in situ grown cobalt disulfide (CoS2) nanoparticles (CoS2/CNTs) as an advanced matrix for sulfur electrode are developed. The 3D interconnected CNTs exhibit a good conductivity and a highly porous structure, which are promising for fast electron transport and buffering volume expansion. Furthermore, abundant CoS2 nanoparticles not only help to chemically trap the soluble polysulfides but also dynamically enhance polysulfide redox reactions. Because of these synchronous advantages, enhanced electrochemical performances including high capacity, superior redox reaction kinetics, and excellent cycling stability are achieved.

However, shuttle effect is one of the most obstacles to make the poor cycling performance and inhibit the development of Li-S batteries. Herein, a kind of large oxygen-containing polymer coated cathode, named polyurethane coated carbon-nanotube/sulfur composites (PU@S-CNT), is prepared from sulfur capsulated by the reaction of hyperbranched polyether and diisocyanate via a simple "one-pot" strategy to impede the shuttle effect. This PU@S-CNT cathode can not only inhibit the dissolution of lithium polysulfides by physical barrier, but also can absorb the lithium polysulfides by the chemical effect. Especially, the cell with PU@S-CNT electrode shows an excellent initial cycling capacity of 892 mAh g(-1) at 2C and remarkable capacity retention (a low decay rate of 0.051% per cycle at 2C after 450 cycles). More importantly, this coated cathode (PU@S-CNT) demonstrates a good inhibition of shuttle effect, high transmission speed of lithium ion and good cycle reversibility. This work exhibits the cross-linked hyperbranched polyurethane is used as coatings of the sulfur cathode for the first time, which can reveal a potential prospect of high-level heteroatom doped coated cathodes for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

J	Wang, LN; Byon, HR				Wang, Lina; Byon, Hye Ryung			N-Methyl-N-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide-based organic electrolyte for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Energy storage; Lithium-sulfur battery; Ionic liquid; Electrolyte	DISCHARGE PERFORMANCE; LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; CELL ELECTROLYTE; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; CATHODE MATERIAL; CARBON; SOLVENT; REVERSIBILITY; CAPACITY; ENERGY	Development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries has suffered from insufficient capacity and poor cycle-life. One of the reasons for these drawbacks is loss of active material, which is associated with the rapid diffusion of highly soluble lithium polysulfides formed as intermediates of discharge products in organic electrolytes, resulting in internal shuttling of lithium polysulfides. The diffusion of lithium polysulfides is determined largely by the physicochemical properties of electrolytes. Therefore, design of the physicochemical properties of the electrolyte to restrain the internal shuttling is vital to promote high performance for Li-S batteries. Here we present a newly designed room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)-based organic electrolyte for Li-S battery. Our electrolyte provides a trade-off between solubility and diffusion rate of lithium polysulfides by mixing very different physicochemical properties of two solvents: high lithium polysulfide solubility of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), and high viscosity of N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PP13-TFSI). An adequate composition ratio of mixed PP13-TFSI/DME afforded large capacity, high Coulombic efficiency, improved capacity retention, and suppressed internal shuttling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Vasant			Recyclable cobalt-molybdenum bimetallic carbide modified separator boosts the polysulfide adsorption-catalysis of lithium sulfur battery	SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; bimetallic carbides; electrocatalysts; polysulfide adsorption-catalysis; modified separators	LI-S BATTERIES; CARBON NANOTUBES; METAL ANODE; PERFORMANCE; NANOPARTICLES; COMPOSITE; CATHODE	The polysulfide shuttling and sluggish redox kinetics, due to the notorious adsorption-catalysis underperformance, are the ultimate obstacles of the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Conventional carbon-based and transition metal compound-based material solutions generally suffer from poor catalysis and adsorption, respectively, despite the performance gain in terms of the other. Herein, we have enhanced polysulfide adsorption-catalytic capability and protected the Li anode using a complementary bimetallic carbide electrocatalyst, Co3Mo3C, modified commercial separator. With this demonstration, the potentials of bimetal compounds, which have been well recognized in other environmental catalysis, are also extended to Li-S batteries. Coupled with this modified separator, a simple cathode (S/Super P composite) can deliver high sulfur utilization, high rate performance, and excellent cycle stability with a low capacity decay rate of similar to 0.034% per cycle at 1 C up to 1000 cycles. Even at a high S-loading of 8.0 mg cm(-2) with electrolyte/sulfur ratio=6 mL g(-1), the cathode still exhibits high areal capacity of similar to 6.8 mA h cm(-2). The experimental analysis and the first principles calculations proved that the bimetallic carbide Co3Mo3C provides more binding sites for adsorbing polysulfides and catalyzing the multiphase conversion of sulfur/polysulfide/sulfide than monometallic carbide Mo2C. Moreover, the modified separator can be reutilized with comparable electrochemical performance. We also showed other bimetallic carbides with similar catalytic effects on Li S batteries and this material family has great promise in different energy electrocatalytic systems.

Herein, these challenges are addressed by constructing an integrated catalyst with dual active sites, where single-atom (SA)-Fe and polar Fe2N are co-embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (SA-Fe/Fe2N@NG). The SA-Fe, with plane-symmetric Fe-4N coordination, and Fe2N, with triangular pyramidal Fe-3N coordination, in this well-designed configuration exhibit synergistic adsorption of polysulfides and catalytic selectivity for Li2Sn lithiation and Li2S delithiation, respectively. These characteristics endow the SA-Fe/Fe2N@NG-modified separator with an optimal polysulfides confinement-catalysis ability, thus accelerating the bidirectional liquid-solid conversion (Li2Sn <-> Li2S) and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, a Li-S battery based on the SA-Fe/Fe2N@NG separator achieves a high capacity retention of 84.1% over 500 cycles at 1 C (pure S cathode, S content: 70 wt%) and a high areal capacity of 5.02 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C (SA-Fe/Fe2N@NG-supported S cathode, S loading = 5 mg cm(-2)). It is expected that the outcomes of the present study will facilitate the design of high-efficiency catalysts for long-lasting Li-S batteries.

To solve these barriers, herein, a heterostructure constructed from CoFe2O4 and SnO2 decorated over the carbon nanofiber framework (CoFe@SnCNF) is reported as a sulfur redox catalyst in the cathode of LSB. A synergism between the multiple adsorptive and catalytic sites of the heterostructure enables an efficient lithium polysulfide (LiPS) entrapment and expedites their conversion, meanwhile the carbon nanofiber framework provides a long-range electrical conduction. Based on these merits, the CoFe@SnCNF integrated sulfur cathode with an areal sulfur loading of similar to 2.2 mg cm(-2) retained 71.1 % of initial capacity after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, and showed excellent cyclability with a capacity fading rate of only 0.11 % over 200 cycles at 0.5 C. Even under a raised sulfur loading of 5.3 mg cm(-2), the cathode still showed an impressive performance with an initial capacity of 442.3 mAh g(-1) that retained 78.1 % after 80 cycles. The findings of this work shed light on the feasibility for further development of novel heterostructure by synergistically coupling various polysulfide adsorbing and catalyzing materials.

In this study, we report the most active catalysts (Ta2O5) for LSB which showed an enhanced rate capability (914 mAh g(-1) at 5 C) in comparison with the previously reported catalysts, TiN (865 mAh g(-1) at 5 C). The addition of Ta2O5 into the carbon-coated separator facilitates the chemical disproportionation of reaction intermeditates, Li2S4 into Li2S8 and Li2S effectively, which leads to the greatly lengthened second plateau in discharge profile. The heterogeneous catalysis of Ta2O5 is clearly verified with the UV-Vis spectra directly showing the change of Li2S4 concentration and the battery performance tests without any active elemental sulfur.

Originating from the complicated redox of lithium polysulfide intermediates, Li-S batteries suffer from several problems, restricting their application and commercialization. Such problems include the shuttle effect of polysulfides (Li2Sx (2 < x <= 8)), low electronic conductivity of S/Li2S/Li2S2, and large volumetric expansion of S upon lithiation. In this study, a lotus root-like nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber (NCNF) structure, assembled with vanadium nitride (VN) catalysts, was fabricated as a 3D freestanding current collector for high performance LSBs. The lotus root-like NCNF structure, which had a multichannel porous nanostructure, was able to provide excellent (ionically/electronically) conductive networks, which promoted ion transport and physical confinement of lithium polysulfides. Further, the structure provided good electrolyte penetration, thereby enhancing the interface contact with active S. VN, with its narrow resolved band gap, showed high electrical conductivity, high catalytic effect and polar chemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides, which is ideal for accelerating the reversible redox kinetics of intermediate polysulfides to improve the utilization of S. Tests showed that the VN-decorated multichannel porous carbon nanofiber structure retained a high specific capacity of 1325 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, with a low capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle, and demonstrated excellent rate capability.

Introducing anchoring materials, which can induce strong binding interaction with Li2Sn species, has been demonstrated as an effective way to overcome this problem and achieve long-term cycling stability and high-rate performance. The interaction between Li2Sn species and anchoring materials should be studied at the atomic level in order to understand the mechanism behind the anchoring effect and to identify ideal anchoring materials to further improve the performance of Li-S batteries. Using first-principles approach with van der Waals interaction included, we systematically investigate the adsorption of Li2Sn species on various two-dimensional layered materials (oxides, sulfides, and chlorides) and study the detailed interaction and electronic structure, including binding strength, configuration distortion, and charge transfer. We gain insight into how van der Waals interaction and chemical binding contribute to the adsorption of Li2Sn species for anchoring materials with strong, medium, and weak interactions. We understand why the anchoring materials can avoid the detachment of Li2S as in carbon substrate, and we discover that too strong binding strength can cause decomposition of Li2Sn species.

Herein, we report a facile strategy to overcome the problems via a double-layer structure, in which one provides strong chemisorption by functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) while the other confines polysulfides physically through coating a layer of rGO film on the electrode. The strategy not only alleviates the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides but also inhibits polysulfides from penetrating into anode to some extent and enhances the electrical conductivity of electrode. The LSBs employing double-layer structure electrodes exhibit high initial capacity of 1353 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 78% capacity retention after 100 cycles, good cycling stability with only 0.056% capacity decay per cycle at 1 C, and remarkable rate capability with 92% reversible capacity retention. The current findings manifest that the double-layer structure can effectively improve the electrochemical performance via the dual synergistic effect of both chemical interaction and physical confinement.

However, the sulfur cathode is more readily passivated under a lean electrolyte condition, resulting in low sulfur utilization. In addition, continuous electrolyte decomposition on the Li metal anode aggravates the problem, provoking rapid capacity decay. In this work, the dual functionalities of NO3- as a high-donor-number (DN) salt anion is presented, which improves the sulfur utilization and cycling stability of lean-electrolyte Li-S batteries. The NO3- anion elevates the solubility of the sulfur species based on its high electron donating ability, achieving a high sulfur utilization of above 1200 mA h g(-1). Furthermore, the anion suppresses electrolyte decomposition on the Li metal by regulating the lithium ion (Li+) solvation sheath, enhancing the cycle performance of the lean electrolyte cell. By understanding the anionic effects, this work demonstrates the potential of the high-DN electrolyte, which is beneficial for both the cathode and anode of Li-S batteries.

Herein a facile combined strategy is reported to fabricate novel porous carbon fibers/vanadium nitride arrays (PCF/VN) composite scaffold for the storage of sulfur via a facile chemical etching united solvothermal-supercritical fluid method. More active sulfur can be stored in the PCF/VN backbone and dual blocking effects associated with "physical block and chemical absorption" for polysulfides are achieved in the PCF/VN/S integrated electrode. The PCF with highly porous structure provides large space to accommodate active sulfur and possesses cross-linked maze channels to physically immobilize the polysulfide species. The VN nanobelt arrays demonstrate strong ability for chemically anchoring the polysulfides, thus retarding the shuttle effect. Due to the unique structure and dual confining effect, the designed PCF/VN/S electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 1310.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, an extended cycle life (1052.5 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles) as well as enhanced rate capability, much better than other counterparts (CF/VN/S, PCF/S, and CF/S). This work opens a new door for fabricating high-performance integrated electrodes for LSBs.

Herein, we propose an interesting strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur battery by utilizing ferroelectric metal-organic framework (FMOF) as a host material for the first time. Compared to other MOF with same structure but without ferroelectricity and commercial carbon black, the cathode based on FMOF exhibits a low capacity decay and high cycling stability. These results demonstrate that the polarization switching behaviors of FMOF under the discharge voltage of lithium-sulfur battery can effectively trap polysulfides by polar-polar interactions, decrease polysulfides shuttle and improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur battery.

These binders are applied to positive electrodes optimised towards high-energy electrochemical performance based only on commercially available materials. Electrodes with up to 4 mAhcm(-2) capacity and 97-98% coulombic efficiency are achievable in electrodes with a 65% total sulfur content and a poly(ethylene oxide): poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PEO: PVP) binder system. Exchange of either binder component for a different polymer with similar functionality preserves the high capacity and coulombic efficiency. The improvement in coulombic efficiency from the inclusion of the coordinating amide group was also observed in electrodes where pyrrolidone moieties were covalently grafted to the carbon black, indicating the role of this functionality in facilitating polysulfide adsorption to the electrode surface. The mechanical properties of the electrodes appear not to significantly influence sulfur utilisation or coulombic efficiency in the short term but rather determine retention of these properties over extended cycling. These results demonstrate the robustness of this very straightforward approach, as well as the considerable scope for designing binder materials with targeted properties.

However, the practical use of Li-S batteries is hindered by several problems such as poor cycle retention, low Coulombic efficiency, low sulfur loading, and so forth. We herein for the first-time propose nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots as the sulfiphilic additive for the advancement of Li-S cell performance. We carry out direct decoration of conducting additives and carbon cloth interlayers with graphene quantum dots and nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots, which are evaluated in Li-S cells. Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots exhibit strong sulfiphilic properties, and therefore, they anchor the liquid-phase polysulfides. The Li-S cell using the nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot-decorated carbon cloth interlayer shows a discharge capacity of 1454.4 mA h g(S)(-1) at 0.1 C and a capacity retention of 98.2% at 0.5 C after 300 cycles even with a sulfur loading of 6.0 mg S cm(-2). Our study demonstrates that the nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dot is a promising additive, which can improve the viability of Li-S cells for the next generation of energy storage systems.

However, the insulating nature and large volumetric expansion of sulfur and the high solubility of polysulfides restrict their practical applications. Here carbon nanotube (CNT)-induced yolk-shell carbon nanopolyhedra, with Co-N-doping, is used as host material for sulfur. The CNTs are used to create a conductive network which interweaves each carbon polyhedron and induces the formation of a yolk-shell structure during the sulfur melt-diffusion process due to the perforation effect. The CNT-connected Co-N-doped carbon nanopolyhedra containing sulfur yolk-shell structure (S@Co-N-C/CNTs-0.5) can achieve a capacity of 712.2 mAh g(-1) at 1675 (1 C) mA g(-1) after 300 cycles and 511.8 mAh g(-1) at 3350 (2 C) mA g(-1). The outstanding performance is attributed to the new paradigm, S@CoNC/CNTs-0.5 yolk-shell structure, which creates a conductive network allowing for improved electron transport and convenient electrolyte infiltration, as well as enhanced reaction kinetics for the electrochemical process synchronously. The significant internal void space of yolkshell structure effectively accommodates the volume expansion of sulfur. Simultaneously, Co-N-doping in yolkshell structure carbon polyhedra can synergistically trap polysulfides due to the strong chemical adsorption.

However, their commercial applications are obstructed by sluggish reaction kinetics and rapid capacity degradation mainly caused by polysulfide shuttling. Herein, the first attempt to utilize a highly conductive metal-organic framework (MOF) of Ni-3(HITP)(2) graphene analogue as the sulfur host material to trap and transform polysulfides for high-performance Li-S batteries is made. Besides, the traditional conductive additive acetylene black is replaced by carbon nanotubes to construct matrix conduction networks for triggering the rate and cycling performance of the active cathode. As a result, the S@Ni-3(HITP)(2) with sulfur content of 65.5 wt% shows excellent sulfur utilization, rate performance, and cyclic durability. It delivers a high initial capacity of 1302.9 mAh g(-1) and good capacity retention of 848.9 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Highly reversible discharge capacities of 807.4 and 629.6 mAh g(-1) are obtained at 0.5 and 1 C for 150 and 300 cycles, respectively. Such kinds of pristine MOFs with high conductivity and abundant polar sites reveal broad promising prospect for application in the field of high-performance Li-S batteries.

Employing an effective catalyst for the conversion of polysulfides in cathode reactions can promote the reaction kinetics to restrain the shuttle of polysulfides. Here, for the first time, La2MoO6 (LMO) as a catalyst is introduced into sulfur cathodes. To investigate the effect of La2MoO6, we prepare two different structures of La2MoO6/carbon nanofiber composites. One is carbon nanofiber-supported crystalline La2MoO6 nanoparticles (LMO@CNFs) and the other is amorphous La2MoO6 nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers (LMO-in-CNFs). For sulfur electrodes with similar to 73 wt % sulfur loading, LMO@CNFs/S and LMO-in-CNFs/S deliver initial gravimetric capacities of 1493.4 and 1246.7 mA h g(-1), respectively, at a 0.1C rate, obviously higher than that of the control sample CNFs/S. Moreover, LMO@CNFs/S shows much better rate performance than LMO-in-CNFs/S, indicating strongly that La2MoO6 is a highly effective catalyst to promote kinetic conversion of polysulfides.

Despite the application of porous carbon materials of various morphologies, the carbon hosts capable of uniformly impregnating highly active sulfur is still challenging. To address this issue, we demonstrate a hierarchical pore-structured CNT particle host containing spherical macropores of several hundred nanometers. The macropore CNT particles (M-CNTPs) are prepared by drying the aerosol droplets in which CNTs and polymer particles are dispersed. The spherical macropore greatly improves the penetration of sulfur into the carbon host in the melt diffusion of sulfur. In addition, the formation of macropores greatly develops the volume of the micropore between CNT strands. As a result, we uniformly impregnate 70 wt % sulfur without sulfur residue. The S-M-CNTP cathode shows a highly reversible capacity of 1343 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 C even at a high sulfur content of 70 wt %. Upon a 10-fold current density increase, a high capacity retention of 74% is observed. These cathodes have a higher sulfur content than those of conventional CNT hosts but nevertheless exhibit excellent performance. Our CNTPs and pore control technology will advance the commercialization of CNT hosts for LSBs.

This porous carbon was then applied as cathode component along with sulfur in lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The carbon materials possessed a high surface area of 2247m(2)g(-1) and a large pore volume of 1.97cm(3)g(-1) with sulfur loading of 63%. From the x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Raman analysis, and SEM observation of the composites, it was shown that the sulfur was uniformly encapsulated inside the carbon pores, which was beneficial for the optimum utilization of sulfur and the confinement of soluble lithium polysulfides. The fabricated carbon-sulfur composite electrodes demonstrated an initial specific capacity of 945mAhg(-1) and good capacity retention until the 100th cycle at 0.1 C rate. At high C rate (1 and 2 C), the composite electrodes exhibited specific discharge capacity of 538 and 466mAhg(-1) until the 100th cycle, respectively. Those excellent electrochemical performances were attributed to the high surface area, combination of micropore/mesopore structures and low average pore diameter of porous carbons.

This novel electrode consists of polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated hollow sulfur microspheres (PVPS) that are homogeneously confined within the conductive composite matrix of graphene and poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS). The characteristic large surface area and wrinkled surface of graphene sheets allow the formation of a conductive layer on the surface of PVPS to suppress the polysulfide dissolution and accommodate the volumetric expansion of sulfur. The addition of PEDOT-PSS also enhances the adhesion between the PVPS and the graphene surface, the overall conductivity of the electrode, and the charge transportation during the charging and discharging processes. The best electrode performances are achieved for a composite film cathode with a sulfur content of about 63.9%, which delivers an initial specific capacity of around 1060 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. This electrode also displays an excellent capacity retention of 75% after 500 cycles at 1C, corresponding to a capacity decay of only 0.05% per cycle. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main challenges of Li-S battery are the severe dissolution of lithium polysulfides and low electrical conductivity of S. In this work, the synthesis of gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles anchored in MWCNT (MCF) is presented through a facile method with refluxing and heating, and studied as effective S hosts in Li-S batteries. In an electrochemical analysis, the S@MCF-1 electrode shows a high rate capability (over 340 mA h g(-1) at 7 C-rate) and stable long-term cycling performance even after 500 cycles (over 545 mA h g(-1), at 1 C-rate). These improved electrochemical performances could be corresponded to the two roles of gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles as (1) the nodes in MWCNTs for mitigating the aggregation and volume expansion of S, and (2) the active sites and strong chemical adsorption ability on the surface of MWCNTs to directly trap polysulfides during the cycling.

In this work, first principles calculations were carried out to systematically investigate O-functionalized Ti2N (Ti2NO2) and F-functionalized Ti2N (Ti2NF2) monolayers as host materials to anchor the soluble Li(2)Sx species. Our results demonstrate that both Ti2NO2 and Ti2NF2 not only possess moderate adsorption energies towards Li(2)Sx species, but also achieve a good balance between adsorption energies and intactness of Li2Sx species, which could avoid the dissolution of Li2Sx species into electrolyte solvents and improve the utilization of active materials. In addition, after adsorption of S-8 and Li2Sx species, the metallic character of Ti2NO2 and Ti2NF2 is still preserved, which benefits the redox reaction of Li2Sx species. Given these exceptional properties, it is expected that Ti2NO2 and Ti2NF2 could be promising host materials for Li-S batteries with good cycling performance.

The nanocomposite is in the form of agglomerated nanoparticles, with the micropores within the carbon filled with sulfur and the mesopores on the carbon surface almost completely covered by sulfur. The BET surface area of the nanocomposite containing a sulfur content of 63.5 wt % is significantly reduced to only 40 m(2) g(-1). Cathodes containing the nanocomposite and Pluronic F427 block copolymer, which partially replaces the polyvinylidene fluoride binder, were prepared and evaluated in lithium cells by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. The nanocomposite cathodes with the copolymer show improved electrochemical stability and cyclability. The Pluronic copolymer helps retain a uniform nanocomposite structure within the electrodes, improving the electrochemical contact, which was manifested by scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The sulfur-Black Pearls nanocomposite with the Pluronic copolymer as an additive in the electrodes is promising for high-rate rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and relatively slow reaction kinetics of sulfur cathode severely hinder the commercial applications of the Li-S battery. Herein, we report NiCo2S4 yolk-shell hollow spheres used as an ideal sulfur host in Li-S battery for the first time. Benefiting from the unique yolk-shell hollow sphere structure and the bimetal sulfide component, the as-synthesized NiCo2S4 yolk-shell hollow spheres cannot only effectively physically absorb the polysulfides but also facilitate the polysulfides conversion. Accordingly, the cathode of S/NiCo2S4 composite with 70 wt% sulfur delivers notable cyclic stability up to 500 cycles at 0.5 C with a capacity decay rate of only 0.074% per cycle. Therefore, this unique NiCo2S4 yolk-shell hollow sphere could be considered an efficient sulfur host material candidate for high-energy density Li-S batteries.

Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF), a commonly used binder in lithium-sulfur batteries, does not have a strong affinity to the intermediate polysulfides, however, leading to fast capacity fading with electrochemical cycling. Herein, copolymers of vinylidene difluoride with other monomers are used as multifunctional binders to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Compared to the PVDF, the copolymer, poly(vinylidene difluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TRFE)) binder exhibits higher adhesion strength, less porosity, and stronger chemical interaction with polysulfides, which helps to keep the polysulfides within the cathode region, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of the lithium-sulfur battery. As a result, sulfur electrode with P(VDF-TRFE) binder delivered a high capacity of 801 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles, which is nearly 80% higher capacity than the corresponding sulfur cathode with PVDF binder.

Here a new type of porous N-doped carbon fiber consisting of hollow carbon nanoparticles (9 wt%-CF) is designed as sulfur scaffold through electrospinning and carbonization processes with ZIF-8 and polyacrylonitrile as precursors. The carbon fiber skeleton can provide high electrical conductivity, and interconnected hollow particles provide ample space to host active materials and to immobilize polysulfides. Moreover, the N-doping further improves the interaction between 9 wt%-CF and polysulfides. Consequently, the as-prepared 9 wt%-CF/S cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1524 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and high capacity retention of 83% after 200 cycles charge/ discharge at 0.5 C with a sulfur loading of 1.9 mg cm-2.

However, serious capacity attenuation caused by shuttle effect still inhibits the performance improvement. Herein, a modified separator consists of the few-layer graphene as a highly conductive network and stable scaffold to support P-doped boron nitride (denoted as BN-P@GO) as the functional interlayer of Li-S batteries. The cell with the interlayer provides an initial discharge capacity as high as 1045.3 mAh g(-1), and retains a high reversible capacity of 728.7 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles with a capacity decay of 0.061% per cycle. Moreover, the rate capability is also superior to cells with BN@GO or BN-P interlayers, i.e. reversible capcity of 457.9 mAh g(-1) even at 3 C. The excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of physical barrier and chemical adsorption for dissolved polysulfides provided by the modified layer. Furhtermore, it also mitigates the polarization and promotes kinetic reactions of the cells. This work provides a concise and effective method for commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries.

The work also includes a new strategy to use active sulfur in the form of catholyte added directly to the electrolyte for improved sulfur utilization. The fabricated Li-S cell with carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) as a cathode host and BC as a separator (CBC@BC) delivers an impressive capacity of 740 mAh g-1 at 1C. It retains a capacity of 310 mAh g-1 even at an ultra-high rate of 4C. To have commercial adoption of CBC@BC, we tested Li-S cells with a high areal loading of 5 mg cm-2.

The lithium-sulfur battery consisting of an activated carbon nanotube (aCNT)/sulfur cathode and an aCNT-modified separator with an optimal composition delivers an excellent reversible capacity of 621 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 C with an exceptionally low degradation rate of 0.043% per cycle. The fascinating performance arises from the ameliorating functional characteristics of aCNTs in both the two battery components. The highly porous, conductive aCNT network facilitates fast electron/ion transport and easy electrolyte penetration into the cathode, facilitating full utilization of active materials. The aCNT layer deposited on separator effectively constrains the polysulfide shuttling by physically blocking their migration to the anode while immobilizing polysulfides by strong adsorption onto the micropores of aCNT surface, as validated by microscopic images and molecular dynamic simulations.

GPEs were prepared in a two-step process. The cross-linked polyepichlorohydrin network was developed using ethylene thiourea (ETU) and magnesium oxide (MgO) as cross-linkers. An immersion method was used for distribution of LiTFSI-salt in the network film. The effects of electrolyte uptake on mechanical and thermal properties of GPEs were studied in detail. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) shows a GPE with a storage modulus higher than 0.6 MPa at ambient temperature (298 K). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was carried out on the GPE to demonstrate the change in glass transition temperature caused by the addition of two plasticizers. Impedance spectroscopy was used to study the ionic conductivity in the GPE. The highest ionic conductivity was found to be 2.4 x 10(-4) S/cm at 298 K. The lithium-sulfur cells in conjunction with the elastomeric gel-polymer electrolyte showed characteristic cyclic voltammograms and charge-discharge plateaus indicating a two stage reduction process and a one stage oxidation process. The battery demonstrated initial specific capacity of 700-800 mA h/g(sulfur) which faded slowly with cycle number. Our present work could pave a new route to fabricate flexible rechargeable batteries with a cross-linked soft polymer electrolyte. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, goat hair, as a low-cost and eco-friendly precursor, is employed to fabricate cauliflower-like in-situ nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus tri-doped porous biomass carbon (NOPC) by a facile activation with H3PO4 and carbonization process. The morphology and microstructure of NOPC can be readily tuned by altering pyrolysis temperature. The as-prepared NOPC matrix material carbonized at 600 degrees C possesses 3D hierarchical porous structure, high specific surface area (535.352 m(2) g(-1)), and appropriate pore size and pore size distribution. Encapsulating sulfur into the NOPC depends on a stem-melting technology as cathode materials of Li-S batteries. Due to the synergistic effect of special physical structure and inherent tri-doping of N, O and P, electrons and ions transfer and utilization of active sulfur in the materials are improved, and the shuttle behaviors of soluble lithium polysulfides are also mitigated. Consequently, the S/NOPC-600 composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, giving a high initial discharge capacity of 1185 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C and maintaining a relatively considerable capacity of 489 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 300 cycles. Our work shows that a promising candidate for cathode material of Li-S batteries can be synthesized using low-cost and renewable biomass materials by a facile process.

Here, inspired by red blood cells, commonly known as an important medium for oxygen transportation, we build a biomimetic micro cell by implement of Aspergillus nigerderived carbon decorated with TiO2-x nanoparticles as an efficient medium for energy storage. Red blood cellmimetic micro cell can confine active materials inside the large space, with abundant and shortened electron/ ion channels endowed by the biconcave structure. Meanwhile, the structure also shows excellent durability, so that once active materials have been loaded, the sufficient reaction sites would facilitate the stable adsorption and conversion of polysulfides for a long-term cycling, enabling to operate like the cell membranes with selective permeability and conversion ability. The as-prepared micro cell cathode demonstrates great application potential, delivering the discharge capacities of 995 and 720 mAh g(-1) after 500 and 700 cycles at 0.5 and 2 C, with the capacity retention around 80%. Density functional theory calculations further show that the oxygen defects can enhance the chemisorption ability of polysulfides, as well as expedite redox reactions of polysulfides by facilitating surface ion transportation.

However, the development of lithium-sulfur battery has been restricted by its low cycle efficiency and low capacity. We present a Plane double-layer structure of AC@S cathode to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. The battery with this cathode showed good electrochemical performance. The initial discharge capacity of the battery with the structure of AC@S cathode could reach 1.166 mAhg(-1) at 0.1 C. After 200 cycles, it still remains a reversible capacity of 793 mAhg(-1) with a low fading rate of 0.16% per cycle. Furthermore, the batteries could hold a discharge capacity of 620 mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles at a typical 0.5 C rate. The improvement of electrochemical performance is attributed to that the polysulfide produced during charge/discharge can be better concentrated in the cathode by the planar double-layer structure, thus reducing the loss of sulfur.

To obtain high-performance Li-S batteries, it is important to inhibit the polysulfide shuttle effect and improve the reaction kinetics of polysulfides. Herein, CoP nanoparticles coated by metal-organic framework-derived N-doped mesoporous carbon (CoP@N-C) composites are synthesized and applied in both a cathode for a sulfur host and a modified layer on a separator for high-energy-density Li-S batteries since the CoP component has strong chemical anchoring capability toward soluble polysulfides and high electrochemical activity toward polysulfides transformation. Meanwhile, the porous structure of conductive N-doped mesoporous carbon can not only buffer the volume variation of sulfur during the charge/discharge process but also enhance the charge transport rate in the cathode. The constructed batteries have demonstrated a high specific capacity of 1222 mAh g(-1) (8.6 mAh cm(-2)) with a high sulfur areal loading of similar to 7.0 mg cm(-2) on cathodes, and a mass loading of 0.35 mg cm(-2) for modified layer on separators. Its average capacity decay is only 0.076% per cycle after 100 cycles. This work presents the highly competitive performance of Li-S batteries on the areal capacity and capacity decay.

CMK-1 has a complex spatial structure and small pores. The structure is good for limiting polysulfide in the pores, but not for rapid transfer of Li+ ions in the cell. CMK-3 and CMK-5 have similar spatial structures and pore sizes, but different pore types. Compared to the single pore structure of CMK-3, the bimodal pore structure of CMK-5 not only improves the electrolyte accessibility, but also increases the number of reaction sites, resulting in better electrochemical performance. Studying the correlation between the physical structure of carbon-based materials and their electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries will provide new insights for optimizing porous electrode materials.

However, their inherent poor conductivity hinders their application in Li-S batteries. Herein, with isophthalic acid (IPA) as the organic ligand and indium ions as the central metal, a tetrahedral cubic indium MOF (In-IPA) was synthesized and employed for the first time as a sulfur host. Experimental results suggest that In-IPA has a good catalytic effect on the conversion of polysulfides. Furthermore, three-dimensional In-IPA was coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by the hydrothermal method (In-IPA@rGO). The interlaced rGO network not only significantly enhances the conductivity of In-IPA but also improves the reduction of kinetic reactions and promotes electron transport. Finally, In-IPA@rGO exhibited excellent electrochemical performance as a sulfur host. In particular, it exhibited a considerable initial capacity of 1672.3 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and a reversible capacity of 898.7 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles. In addition, the initial capacity reached 1376.7 mAh g-1 and retained 519.8 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. This work proves that nontransition metal-organic frameworks prepared along with highly conductive rGO have synergistic advantages in Li-S battery applications.

The two-dimensional network and rich pore structure of HsGDY can enable the fast physical adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). In situ Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations confirm that the acetylenic bonds in HsGDY can trap the Li+ of LiPSs owing to the strong adsorption of Li+ by acetylenic active sites. The strong physical adsorption and chemical anchoring of LiPSs by the HsGDY materials promote the conversion reaction of LiPSs to further mitigate the shuttling problem. As a result, Li-S batteries integrated with the all-carbon interlayers exhibit excellent cycling stability during long-term cycling with an attenuation rate of 0.089% per cycle at 1 C over 500 cycles.

Herein, in order to enhance the volumetric energy density of sulfur cathode, a universal approach is proposed to fabricate a compact sulfur cathode with dense materials as sulfur host, instead of the old-fashioned lightweight carbon nanomaterials. Based on this strategy, heavy lanthanum strontium manganese oxide (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3), with a high theoretical density of up to 6.5 g cm(-3), is introduced as sulfur host. Meanwhile, the La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 host also acts as an efficient electrocatalyst to accelerate the diffusion, adsorption, and redox dynamics of lithium polysulfides in the charge-discharge processes. As a result, such S/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 cathode presents high gravimetric/volumetric capacity and outstanding cycling stability. Moreover, an ultra-high volumetric energy density of 2727 Wh L--cathode(-1) is achieved based on the densification effect with higher density (1.69 g cm(-3)), which is competitive to the Ni-rich oxide cathode (1800-2160 Wh L-1) of lithium-ion batteries. The current study opens up a path for constructing high volumetric capacity sulfur cathode with heavy and catalytic host toward practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Cobalt disulfide-modified cellular hierarchical porous carbon derived from bovine bone for application in high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Bovine bone; Cellular hierarchical porous carbon; Cobalt disulfide; Electrochemical performance	NITROGEN-DOPED GRAPHENE; COMPOSITE CATHODE; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; HOLLOW CARBON; SURFACE-AREA; NANOTUBES; ELECTRODE; CHEMISORPTION; MICROSPHERES; NANOSHEETS	Improving the insulating nature of sulfur and retaining the soluble polysulfides in sulfur cathodes are crucial for realizing the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Biomass-based carbon is becoming increasingly popular for fabricating economical and efficient cathodes for LSB5 owing to its unique structure. Herein, we report a facile strategy to transform bovine bone with an organic-inorganic structure into cellular hierarchical porous carbon via carbonization and KOH activation, followed by CoS2 modification through hydrothermal treatment. The synthesized composite can load abundant sulfur and produce a dual effect of "physical confinement and chemical entrapment" on polysulfides. The conductive carbon frame with the developed porous structure provides adequate space to accommodate sulfur and physically suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The embedded half-metallic CoS2 sites can chemically anchor the polysulfides and enhance the electrochemical reaction activity as well. Owing to the multifunctional structure and dual restraint effect, the designed electrode exhibits enhanced electrochemical properties including high initial capacity (1230.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), improved cycling stability and enhanced rate capability.

Sulfur is loaded in a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber (CNF) framework impregnated with Mn3O4 nanoparticles. The 3D interconnected CNF framework creates an architecture with outstanding mechanical properties. Synergetic effects generated from physical and chemical entrapment could effectively suppress the dissolution and diffusion of the polysulfides. Electrochemical measurements suggest that the rationally designed structure endows the electrode with high utilization of sulfur and good cycle performance. Specifically, the cathode with a high areal sulfur loading of 11 mg cm(-2) exhibits a reversible areal capacity over 8 mAh cm(-2). The fabrication procedure is of low cost and readily scalable. We believe that this work will provide a promising choice for potential practical applications.

Acetylenic bond (-C C-C C-) and benzene ring in the GDY coating layer are experimentally verified to reversibly attract the soluble lithium polysulfides by chemical adsorption during cycling. Meanwhile, the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides is further physically restricted by the GDY coating layer due to the evenly distributed pores (5.42 angstrom) and a consistent interlayer spacing (3.65 angstrom) of GDY. Moreover, GDY is a conducting carbon skeleton with high Li+ mobility that can improve the rate performance. Hence, Li-S battery with an as-prepared GDY coating layer shows excellent electrochemical performances including superior specific capacity, excellent rate performance, and low capacity attenuation rate. The high initial discharge capacity of 1648.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and 819.5 mA h g(-1) even at a high rate of 2C is achieved by this novel separator. The initial capacity of 1112.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.SC is retained to 816.7 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles with a low attenuation rate of 0.13% per cycle. Compared with other coated separators, these results show that the GDY coating layer endows the separator with superior electrochemical performances for Li-S battery.

Herein, an atomic engineering strategy is innovatively proposed to constructing a sulfur host consisting of chemical-anchoring zinc atomic cluster within double layer N-doped carbon matrix (Zn-AC-CM@CL) for addressing concerns. The as-prepared Zn-AC-CM@CL@S can deliver capacity as high as 1451 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S ratio) of 5.5 mu L mg(-1) and maintain 749 mAh g(-1) after 1200 cycles (fading rate of 0.021% per cycle) at 5 C. Remarkably, the reversible capacity holds 627 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C at the -25 degrees C. By a further combination analysis of electron holography (EH) and geometry phase analysis (GPA), the outstanding performance is revealed to be mainly traced to synergistic effect of the polarity N-doped multi-layer carbon matrix and internal periodical charge field induced by atomic strain, greatly enhancing the capability towards on the immobilization and conversion of intermediate polysulfides. More importantly, such an interplay also renders the strongly coupled cathode achieve a high area specific capacity of 8.71 mAh cm(-2) even the area sulfur loading obtain to 7.34 mg cm(-2). This atomic-level engineering strategy might shed light on the novel insights on the design of high performance for sulfur hosts.

This mixed binder formulation combines the local improvement to the solvent system offered by PEO and the lithium (poly)sulfide-stabilising effect of PVP. Cells with cathodes made of simple mixtures of sulfur powder and carbon black with a binder of 4:1 PEO:PVP exhibited a reversible capacity of over 1000 mAh g(-1) at C/5 after 50 cycles and 800 mAh g(-1) at 1C after 200 cycles. Furthermore, these materials are water soluble, environmentally friendly and widely available, making them particularly interesting for large-scale production and applications in, for example, electric vehicles.

At the cathode, the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle effect must be inhibited and the redox reaction kinetics need to be substantially promoted. In this direction, this work proposes a cathode material based on a transition-metal selenide (TMSe) as both adsorber and catalyst and a hollow nanoreactor architecture: ZnSe/N-doped hollow carbon (ZnSe/NHC). It is here demonstrated both experimentally and by means of density functional theory that this composite provides three key benefits to the LSBs cathode: (i) A highly effective trapping of LiPS due to the combination of sulfiphilic sites of ZnSe, lithiophilic sites of NHC, and the confinement effect of the cage-based structure; (ii) a redox kinetic improvement in part associated with the multiple adsorption sites that facilitate the Li+ diffusion; and (iii) an easier accommodation of the volume expansion preventing the cathode damage due to the hollow design. As a result, LSB cathodes based on S@ZnSe/NHC are characterized by high initial capacities, superior rate capability, and an excellent stability. Overall, this work not only demonstrates the large potential of TMSe as cathode materials in LSBs but also probes the nanoreactor design to be a highly suitable architecture to enhance cycle stability.

Instrumental analysis shows that the obtained NOPC possesses a special hierarchical porous carbon structure, large specific surface area (2690.3 m(2) g(-1)), high pore volume (1.34 cm(3) g(-1)) and appropriate N and O co-doping. The NOPC is then used to synthesize the NOPC-sulfur (NOPC/S) composite as the cathode material of lithium-sulfur batteries for the first time. The NOPC/S composite with 64.5 wt% sulfur content delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1185.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and a good rate capability (482.7 mAh g(-1) at 2C). When cycling at 1C, the first and the 600th discharge capacities of 698.5 mAh g(-1) and 435.7 mAh g(-1) are retained, respectively, along with a low decay rate of 0.063% per cycle. The superior electrochemical property is primarily attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure and in-situ N and O co-doping, which can effectively sequestrate the soluble lithium polysulfides by combining physical confinement and strong chemical adsorption.

Herein, red phosphorus nanoparticles are employed, for the first time, to establish a metal-free and cost-effective multifunctional separator, which not only efficiently immobilizes the lithium polysulfides but also facilitates the ion conduction for fast and durable sulfur redox reactions. The computational and experimental results reveal that red phosphorus is capable of chemically confining the polysulfides through a combination of the Lewis acid-base interaction and sulfur-chain catenation, while the highly conducive Li3PO4 is generated during the cell operation and facilitates ion transportation. Attributed to these unique features, the cells based on the as-developed separator exhibit a high sulfur utilization of 1287 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, superb rate capability of 809 mAh g(-1) at up to 2 C, and excellent cycling performance with 82% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C. This facile and low-cost strategy not only offers an effective pathway towards enhancement in battery performance, but could also inspire new thinking on developing metal-free functional agents for improved sulfur electrochemistry.

Herein, conductive carbon nanoparticles (Ketjen Black, KB) covered by borocarbonitride (BCN) are assembled into micro-sized particles to form a polar KB@BCN hybrid, which is employed as a sulfur host with enhanced tap density via a facile intergrowth method. At a molecular level, BCN, endowed with abundant adsorption sites as the adsorbent and catalyst, can adsorb polysulfides and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides. On the nanometer scale, the BCN is loaded on the highly conductive KB nanoparticles, which can improve the conductivity of the hybrid (1786 S m-1), thereby improving the conversion of polysulfides. On the micrometer scale, the BCN and the KB nanoparticles together form micro-sized particles to improve the tap density, which is beneficial to build thick electrodes and reduce the amount of electrolyte. When applied as a sulfur cathode, KB@BCN-2 shows good cycling capability (a low-capacity decay of 0.05% after 800 cycles at 0.5C) and high rate performance (765 mA h g-1 at 3.0C). Even under a lean electrolyte condition (E/S = 5 mu L mg-1), the KB@BCN-2-S has a high initial capacity of 1266 mA h g-1 at 0.1C. Significantly, incorporating polar electrocatalysts with carbon matrix to form a high-density sulfur host through secondary granulation can provide a new insight for achieving high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the polysulfide dissolution related issue in the lithium-sulfur battery is the major hurdle which needs to be reduced prior to the acceptance of rechargeable lithium-sulfur technology as a practically viable and feasible strategy to ensure efficient energy storage mechanisms. Toward this direction, we study the effect of oxidative functionalization and effect of temperature on the cyclability of lithium-sulfur battery as a function of their role in reducing the polysulfide dissolution by using EIS technique. The study demonstrates the reversible cycling of lithium-sulfur battery at 40 degrees C, wherein the cell delivers a discharge capacity of 750 mA h g(-1) at a high current of 750 mA g(-1) and tolerates up to 7.5 A g(-1) current rate with the 60 wt % sulfur loaded functionalized carbon cathode. Our findings reflect the advantageous effect of surface functionalization on the performance of lithium-sulfur battery and the importance of EIS spectroscopy in understanding the mechanism associated with the reversible electrochemical process.

Herein, a multi-component material with cobalt and molybdenum carbide nanoparticles grafted on bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-Mo2C@NCNTs) is fabricated and applied to modify the separator to suppress polysulfide migration and to promote polysulfide conversion. The uniformly distributed Co and Mo2C nanoparticles act as both the adsorbent to capture the polysulfides with Co-S and Mo-S bonds by Lewis acid-base interactions and the catalyst to further accelerate the reaction kinetics of polysulfide transformation. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with the Co-Mo2C@NCNTs-coated separator deliver a high specific capacity of 1324 mAh g(-1)at 0.2 C and a capacity decay rate of 0.068 % per cycle at 1 C for 500 cycles. The results suggest the efficient chemical anchoring and catalysis of the multifunctional Co-Mo2C@NCNTs composite as a feasible method for future large-scale applications of high-performance Li-S batteries.

To address above issues, we propose a new strategy to suppress the shuttle effect for greatly enhancedlithium sulfur battery performance mainly through the formation of short-chain intermediates during discharging, which allows significant improvements including high capacity retention of 1022 mAh/g with 87% retention for 450 cycles. Without LiNO3-containing electrolytes, the excellent Coulombic efficiency of similar to 99.5% for more than 500 cycles is obtained, suggesting the greatly suppressed shuttle effect. In situ UV/vis analysis of electrolyte during cycling reveals that the short-chain Li2S2 and Li2S3 polysulfides are detected as main intermediates, which are theoretically verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our strategy may open up a new avenue for practical application of lithium sulfur battery.

The prepared HCNF@NPC-S composite with high sulfur content of approximately 80 wt% shows an obvious coaxial-cable structure with an NPC layer coating on the surface of the linear HCNFs along the length and sulfur homogeneously distributes in the coating layer. This material exhibits much better electrochemical performance than the HCNF-S composite, delivers initial discharge capacity of 982 mAh g(-1) and maintains a high capacity retention rate of 63% after 200 cycles at a high current density of 837.5 mA g(-1). The significantly enhanced electrochemical performance of the HCNF@NPC-S composite is attributed to the unique coaxial-cable structure, in which the linear HCNF core provides electronic conduction pathways and works as mechanical support, and the NPC shell with nitrogen-doped and porous structure can trap sulfur/polysulfides and provide Li+ conductive pathways.

Nevertheless, the shuttle effect caused by the diffusion of polysulfides obstructs the further development of Li-S batteries. In this work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with enriched polysulfides adsorption sites of pyridinic-N has been utilized as one kind of chemical adsorption materials to restrict the migration of polysulfides. The vacuum-filtration technique has been employed to cover an ultrathin g-C3N4 film onto the commercial polypropylene (PP) separator (denoted as g-C3N4 separator) which has an effective suppression of polysulfides travel without increasing the mass of the whole battery. Besides, this strategy is simple, straightforward, and effective. As a result, an excellent reversible capacity of 829 mA h g(-1) is retained at 0.2C after 200 cycles, much better than that of the battery with a traditional PP separator. Meanwhile, when coupled with the g-C3N4 separator, the Li-S batteries also shows lower self-discharge rate. This result shows a great potential for the mass applications of g-C3N4 separator for Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here a metal-free cathode, using graphene-coated polyethylene terephthalate (G-PET) film (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) as current collector and sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) as active material, is aiming at low cost and high energy density battery. 110 mAh prototype lithium sulfur cells are assembled using SPAN/G-PET cathode, showing energy density of 452 Wh kg(-1) excluding the weight of package and capacity retention of 96.8% after 30 cycles at 100% depth of discharge. The self-discharge characteristics of prototype cells are tested. After 30 days of storage at room temperature, the discharge capacity has decreased less than 1%, indicative of low self-discharge of the SPAN-based Li/S batteries. This paper shows that G-PET can be a potential promising current collector for lithium ion batteries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the persisting issue of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) dissolution and the shuttling effect that impedes the efficiency of LSBs are challenging to resolve. Herein a general synthesis of highly dispersed pyrrhotite Fe1-xS nanoparticles embedded in hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon spheres (Fe1-xS-NC) is proposed. Fe1-xS-NC has a high specific surface area (627 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (0.41 cm(3) g(-1)), and enhanced adsorption and electrocatalytic transition toward LiPs. Furthermore, in situ generated large mesoporous pores within carbon spheres can accommodate high sulfur loading of up to 75%, and sustain volume variations during charge/discharge cycles as well as improve ionic/mass transfer. The exceptional adsorption properties of Fe1-xS-NC for LiPs are predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally. Subsequently, the electrocatalytic activity of Fe1-xS-NC is thoroughly verified. The results confirm Fe1-xS-NC is a highly efficient nanoreactor for sulfur loading. Consequently, the Fe1-xS-NC nanoreactor performs extremely well as a cathodic material for LSBs, exhibiting a high initial capacity of 1070 mAh g(-1) with nearly no capacity loss after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. Furthermore, the resulting LSBs display remarkably enhanced rate capability and cyclability even at a high sulfur loading of 8.14 mg cm(-2).

Herein, Mo2C-C nano-octahedrons (Mo2C-C NOs) with Mo2C nanoparticles embedded in a three-dimensional porous carbon matrix have been prepared via a metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) assisted strategy, and used as the sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The Mo2C-C NOs@S cathode demonstrates a high initial specific capacity of 1396 and 1050 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 1 C, respectively, with an ultra-low average specific capacity decay rate of 0.0457% per cycle within 600 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, Mo2C-C NOs@S cathode with high areal sulfur loading of 4.2 mg s cm(-2) can deliver a high initial discharge specific capacity of 807 mAh g(-1), and a capacity of 623 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. The existence of Mo2C nanoparticles can not only immobilize LiPSs via the formation of Mo-S bond, but also electrocatalytically accelerate the redox kinetics towards LiPSs conversion. Meanwhile, the interconnected porous carbon matrices contributes to effective sulfur/electrolyte infiltration, fast electron/Li+ ion transportation and sufficient buffer for volume change.

In this work, a unique consecutive and oxygen-deficient niobium oxide (Nb2O5-x) framework featured with 3D ordered macroporous (3DOM) architecture and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedding is developed, which serves as a high-performance sulfur immobilizer and catalytic promoter for polysulfide conversion. The 3DOM architecture affords a robust porous and open framework that favors electrolyte infiltration for fast ion/mass transfer, as well as interface exposure for massive host-guest interactions. More importantly, CNTs are designed as "antennae" embedded within the Nb(2)O(5-x)skeleton, which not only contributes to a highly conductive framework but also intensifies the oxygen deficiency with enhanced sulfur immobilization and reaction catalyzation. Benefiting from these advanced features, Li-S cells based on S-Nb2O5-x/CNTs cathode achieve excellent cyclability with a high capacity retention of 847 mAh g(-1)after 500 cycles and remarkable rate capability with 741 mAh g(-1)at 5 C. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 6.07 mAh cm(-2)can also be achieved under a high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm(-2), illustrating great potential in the development of practical Li-S batteries.

In the hydrothermal process, graphene oxide is both employed as the precursor for the central graphene filling and a sheet-like template for both-side formation of N-doped porous carbon layers, resulting in an N-doped carbon sandwich structure (N-CS). This carbon sandwich is about 50-70 nm in thickness and has a high specific surface area (similar to 2677 m(2) g(-1)) and a large pore volume (similar to 1.8 cm(3) g(-1)), making it a promising high capacity reservoir for sulfur and polysulfide in a lithium-sulfur cell. The sheet-like morphology and the interconnected pore structure of the N-CS, together with a nitrogen content of 2.2%, are transformed to the assembled N-CS/sulfur cell with a high rate performance and excellent cycling stability because of fast ion diffusion and electron transfer. At a 2C rate, the reversible capacity is up to 625 mA h g(-1) and remains at 461 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles with only 0.13% capacity fading per cycle. More interestingly, the sheet-like structure helps the N-CS materials form a tightly stacked coating on an electrode sheet, guaranteeing a volumetric capacity as high as 350 mA h cm(-3).

The one-dimensional of Ti4O7 nanorods (1D Ti4O7 NRs) and three-dimensional of Ti4O7 nanoparticles (3D Ti4O7 NPs) were successfully achieved and investigated well by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis (BET). The as-prepared Ti4O7 nanostructures were used as additive to prepare Ti4O7/sulfur composite cathodes. The initial discharge capacity of the sulfur cathode with the added Ti4O7 NRs was 1050 mAh g(-1), and remaining capacity was 580 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1C. Even at a high current density of 2C, it also kept at a high discharge capacity of 590 mAh g(-1). Compared with Ti4O7 NPs/sulfur electrode, the electrodes containing Ti4O7 NRs show the excellent cycling and rate performance, confirming that the morphology of Ti4O7 could effectively influence its electrochemical performance for lithium sulfur batteries. The good electrochemical properties of Ti4O7 NRs can be attributed to the higher catalytic activity in the lithium-sulfur redox reaction, the lower charge-transfer resistance and larger lithium ion diffusion coefficient.

However, several inherent issues obstruct the business application of LSB. To address these issues, we assemble core-shell structure Fe3O4@C nanodots with 5 nm diameter as a valid sulfur host via a convenient organic pyrolysis treatment followed by calcination. The nanosized Fe(3)O(4)particles could expose more chemisorption sites and inhibit the polysulfides shuttle. Moreover, the carbon layer could not only increase the conductivity but also ensure structural integrity during cyclic process. Furthermore, the mesoporous channels around Fe3O4@C could supply sufficient space to load sulfur and physically restrict the shuttle of polysulfides. Thus, the resultant S/Fe3O4@C cathode shows a highly initial capacity of 1089 mAh g(-1)at 0.2 C, even retains 655 mAh g(-1)over 200 cycles at 1 C.

Herein, we prepared a functional carbon nanotube (CNT) and Fe-based Prussian blue (PB)@MXene/polypropylene (PP) composite separator using a facile vacuum filtration approach. The CNTs and MXene nanosheets are excellent electronic conductors that can enhance the composite separator electrical conductivity, while Fe-based Prussian blue with a rich pore structure can effectively suppress the migration by providing physical space to anchor soluble LiPSs and retain it as cathode active material. Additionally, MXene nanosheets can be well attached to Fe-based Prussian blue by an electrostatic interaction and contribute to the physical barriers that inhibit the shuttle of long-chain soluble Li2Sn (4 <= n <= 8). When used as a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cell membrane with a functional coating layer of CNT+PB@MXene facing the cathode side, the batteries reveal a high initial discharge capacity (1042.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), outstanding rate capability (90% retention of capacity at 1.0 C) and high reversible capacity (674.1 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1.0 V). Of note, separator modification is a feasible method to improve the electrochemical performance of LSBs.

Expediting redox kinetics of sulfur species is a decisive task to break the kinetic limitation of insulating lithium sulfide/disulfide precipitation/dissolution. Herein, we proposed a porphyrin-derived atomic electrocatalyst to exert atomic-efficient electrocatalytic effects on polysulfide intermediates. Quantifying electrocatalytic efficiency of liquid/solid conversion through a potentiostatic intermittent titration technique measurement presents a kinetic understanding of specific phase evolutions imparted by the atomic electrocatalyst. Benefiting from atomically dispersed "lithiophilic" and "sulfiphilic" sites on conductive substrates, the finely designed atomic electrocatalyst endows Li-S cells with remarkable cycling stablity (cyclic decay rate of 0.10% in 300cycles), excellent rate capability (1035 mAh g(-1) at 2 C), and impressive areal capacity (10.9 mAh cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of 11.3 mgcm(-2)). The present work expands atomic electrocatalysts to the Li-S chemistry, deepens kinetic understanding of sulfur species evolution, and encourages application of emerging electrocatalysis in other multielectron/multiphase reaction energy systems.

Flexible sulfur wires (Flex-SWs)-A new versatile platform for lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Electrospinning; Lithium-Sulfur; Flexible electrodes; Sulfur fibers; Textile battery	TEXTILE BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIALS; ANODE MATERIAL; POROUS CARBON; COMPOSITE; PERFORMANCE; NANOTUBE; ELECTRODE; INTERCALATION; STABILITY	A simple electrospinning methodology is described for generating novel fiber configurations of sulfur with the potential of yielding high performance sulfur electrodes for use in lithium-sulfur batteries. The unique fiber morphology derived by electrospinning has the capability of generating flexible sulfur yarns for the first time rendering them a highly attractive platform for small-scale mobile device applications such as textile-batteries. The electrospinning methodology reported herein also allows for the formation of a polymer-sulfur interface which acts as a physical barrier to liquid lithium electrolyte facilitating the reduction of polysulfide dissolution, a primary barrier to the progress of Li-S systems. Such flexible sulfur wire materials when converted into pellet sulfur electrodes, exhibit very stable capacities over 135 cycles with high areal capacities (similar to 2.5 mAh cm (2)). Coating the electrodes with an inorganic lithium ion conductor coating results in further improvement of cycling behavior with electrodes of similar to 650 mAhg (1) capacity and an impressive low fade rate of similar to 0.003% fade cycle (1) demonstrating the promise of this unique platform.

J	Kim, S; Jung, Y; Park, SJ				Kim, Seok; Jung, Yongju; Park, Soo-Jin			Effect of imidazolium cation on cycle life characteristics of secondary lithium-sulfur cells using liquid electrolytes	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						imidazolium salts; lithium-sulfur cells; electrolytes; discharge characteristics; cycle life	IONIC LIQUIDS; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; DISCHARGE PERFORMANCE; REDUCTION; SOLVENT; BATTERY; DIMETHYLFORMAMIDE; POLYSULFIDES; NEUTRALIZATION; MECHANISMS	The cycle life performance of rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells was examined by using DNIE/DOX (4/1) solvent systems, where supporting electrolyte systems used were classified into the two groups: (1) conventional lithium salts and (2) mixed salts composed of lithium salt and imidazolium salt. To analyze the effect of the imidazolium cation on the cycle life characteristics of secondary Li-S cells, we applied the following three kinds of immidazolium salts, with the same anion, to the mixed-salt systems: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI); 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMITFSI); 1,2dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfony)imide (DMPITFSI). Even after 100 cycles, the EMI- and BMI-added Li-S cells showed much larger capacities, 721 and 642 mAh g(-1)-sulfur, respectively, when compared to that (534 mAh g(-1)-sulfur) of the LiTFSI-based Li-S cells. By contrast, the DMPI-added Li-S cells showed poor cycle life performance in that their capacity decreased to below 200 mAh g(-1)-sulfur even before 10 cycles. It is probable that this phenomenon is due mainly to the deactivation of the carbon cathode caused by coating of non-conductive and insoluble materials, which might result from side reactions between DMPI and lithium polysulfides.

Here, we develop a Li2S-VGCF (Vapor Grown Carbon Fiber) nanocomposite positive electrode for an all-solid-state lithium-sulfur battery that significantly improves cyclability. The Li2S-VGCF nanocomposite is prepared by a solution-based technique with subsequent heat-treatment in order to control the formation of Li2S nanocrystals within the VGCF electron conducting matrix. The small, well -dispersed Li2S nanocrystals offer a large contact area with the solid electrolyte and electron conducting carbon in the composite cathode. To furthet improve conductivity, the composite cathode employs a multi-dimensional approach with long 1-D VGCF fibers supporting long distance electron transport and O-D carbon powder enhancing the contact area with the Li2S active material at lower total carbon content. In the all-solid-state batteries, the highest initial capacity of 469 mhA"g-1 is obtained at conditions of 500 C during heat-treatment. Activation of Li2S is observed during the first 10 cycles. Subsequently, the capacity gradually increased up to 600 mAh.g-1 (g of Li2S). The optimized cell exhibits excellent cyclic performance through 20 cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of -100%.

However, great challenges such as fast capacity degradation and safety concerns prevent it from widespread application. With the adoption of Li metal as the anode, dendritic and mossy metal depositing on the negative electrode during repeated cycles leads to serious safety concerns and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, we report a distinctive graphene framework structure coated by an in situ formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with Li depositing in the pores as the anode of Li-S batteries. The graphene-based metal anode demonstated a superior dendrite-inhibition behavior in 70 h of lithiation, while the cell with a Cu foil based metal anode was short-circuited after only 4 h of lithiation at 0.5 mA cm(-2). The graphene-modified Li anode with SEI induced by the polysulfide-containing electrolyte improved the Coulombic efficiency to 97% for more than 100 cycles, while the control sample with Cu foil as the current collector exhibited huge fluctuations in Coulonnbic efficiency. The unblocked ion pathways and high electron conductivities of frameworks in the modified metal anode led to the rapid transfer of Li ions through the SEI and endowed the anode framework with an ion conductivity of 7.81 x 10(-2) mS Cm-1, nearly quintuple that of the Cu foil based Li metal anode. Besides, the polarization in the charge discharge process was halved to 30 mV. The stable and efficient Li deposition was maintained after 2000 cycles. Our results indicated that nanoscale interfacial electrode engineering could be a promising strategy to tackle the intrinsic problems of lithium metal anodes, thus improving the safety of Li-S cells.

However, the shuttle effect of the soluble polysulfide intermediates could lead to a severe self-discharge effect that hinders the development of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this paper, a battery separator has been prepared based on NiFe2O4/Ketjen Black (KB) modification by a simple method to solve the shuttle effect and improve the battery performance. The as-modified separator with the combination of small-size KB and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles can effectively use the physical and chemical double-layer adsorption to prevent polysulfide from the shuttle. Moreover, it can give full play to its catalytic effect to improve the conversion efficiency of polysulfide and activate the dead sulfur. The results show that the NiFe2O4/KB-modified separator battery still maintains a discharge capacity of 406.27 mAh/g after 1000 stable cycles at a high current density of 1 C. Furthermore, the coulombic efficiency remains at 99%, and the average capacity attenuation per cycle is only 0.051%. This simple and effective method can significantly improve the application capacity of lithium-sulfur batteries.

In order to solve the above problems, this paper has successfully compounded carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and cerium dioxide (CeO2) nanomaterials by a simple hydrothermal method to prepare CNTs-MoS2/CeO2 nanocomposites, in which MoS2 catalyzes the conversion of long-chain polysulfides to short-chain polysulfides, and CeO2 can adsorb polysulfides and inhibit their dissolution, thus alleviating the "shuttle effect." The experimental results show that the composites have excellent electrochemical performance, with a discharge capacity of 1373.4 mAh g(-1) in the first cycle at a current density of 0.1 C, and a discharge capacity of 933.9 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C.

The TCNFs interlayer acts as both physical barrier and chemical adsorption agent for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), in which the 3D CNFs network with large volume and high conductivity contributes to LiPSs conversion and electron transfer, while the 'sulphiphilic' Ti4O7 with strong chemical bonding to the soluble long-chain LiPSs contributes to less LiPSs dissolution and higher coulombic efficiency. In a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cell, CMK3/S cathode with TCNFs interlayer exhibits greatly enhanced electrochemical capability than CMK3/S with CNFs interlayer and without interlayer, and a capacity of 560 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles is obtained under a high current density of 1 C. Even at 3 C, the capacity decay is merely 0.030% per cycle over 2500 cycles. Notably, the simple, affordable and scalable fabrication method to form a controllable free-standing interlayer that brings a novel horizon on material structure design and performance improvement in practical application of Li-S batteries.

For a robust TENG with constant impetus, the output current will keep steady unless the external load resistance is changed. Therefore, the difference of charging current reflects the different charging resistance of the battery. Herein, the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is charged by robust stable scale-like structured TENG (SL-TENG), and the real-time charging current is recorded. The charging current increases with the initial potential rise, reflecting the oxidation process of the precipitated Li2S and Li2S2 with poor conductivity. Then the charging current keeps almost no change in flat charge plateau, accompanying with the main production of S-8(2-), S-7(2-), S-6(2-), and S-5(2-). Finally it shows a steep drop when the potential exceeds 2.4 V, accompanying with the second oxidation stage of the main production of S-8. Moreover, under SL-TENG charging protocol, the capacity of Li-S battery increases obviously, and Li ions tend to deposit as large grain with smooth surface. SL-TENG charging protocol is beneficial to improve the performance of Li-S battery, as well as helping to understand the charging mechanism to some extent.

The cell with the carbon fiber current collector has exhibited remarkably enhanced electrochemical performance compared with its Ni foam counterpart, delivering a high initial capacity of 1,278 mAh g(-1) and maintaining a discharge capacity at 810 mAh g(-1) after 40 cycles at 0.06 C. Furthermore, the carbon fiber-based cell demonstrated a better rate capability and delivered a highly reversible discharge capacity of 397 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.5 C, representing an increase of 194 mAh g(-1) compared to the Ni foam counterpart. The electrochemical property investigations along with scanning electron microscope studies have revealed that the carbon fiber current collector possesses a three-dimensional network structure, provides an effective electron conduction path, and minimizes the loss of electrical contact within the deposited cathode material during cycling. These results indicate that the carbon fiber cloth can be used as a promising, effective, and inexpensive current collector for Li/S batteries.

Lithium Sulfur batteries are considered as the most promising candidate owing to their high energy and low cost. However, shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide between the cathode and anode is one of the vital obstacles limiting their commercial application. Here, we design and fabricate a multi-functional interlayer by padding the molybdenum net with graphite or graphite/molybdenum trioxide composite that is able to adsorb polysulfide effectively thus alleviate the diffusion of polysulfide. The weak molybdenum-oxygen bonds on the surface of molybdenum trioxide nanoparticles provide efficient adsorption site to capture polysulfide. In addition, part of molybdenum trioxide can have lithium-ion intercalated to form lithium molybdenum trioxide, which contributes extra reversible capacity for the lithium-sulfur battery. molybdenum net ensures high electron conductivity and mechanical flexibility to facilitate charge transfer and endure inner stress. Coupling these advantages together, the lithium-sulfur cells with the multi-functional interlayer achieve a reversible capacity of 816 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with the capacity retention of 95%.

Herein, porous TiN-C microspheres are synthesized through a facile spray drying method, followed by annealing treatment and subsequent removal of template. The as-obtained composite not only has high pore volume to accommodate sufficient sulfur, but also provide efficient suppression for "shuttle effect" due to strongly chemical confinement with LiPSs offered by polar TiN. When used in Li-S battery, the TiN-C/S cathode exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 989 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and maintains 689 mA h g(-1) after 700 cycles with a low capacity fading rate of 0.043% per cycle. Furthermore, the cathode delivers high capacity of 640 mA h g(-1) and 544 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 400 cycles with high sulfur loadings of 3 mg cm(-2) and 5 mg cm(-2), respectively.

The results showed that the capacity retention of the cathode with porous carbon as additive increased from 44% to 59% after 50 cycles at 0.1 C compared with the common cathode. Attracted on the excellent performance of cathode with porous carbon, the asymmetry electrode was fabricated by coating a porous layer on the cathode to trap the polysulfides produced during the discharge- charge process further.

This technique efficiently exploits the synergistic effect of ability of stabilizing the polymeric sulfur. The role of uniform distribution of highly conductive LCNT network is optimized as a cathode host material by solution route. Annealed sulfur-copolymer (S-co-poly) composites are homogeneously well attached via physisorption with LCNT submicron channel. The composite shows a high discharge capacity of 1040 mAh g(-1) in the 1st cycle of galvanostatic charge-discharge at 0.5C. Whereas, the cell maintains a reversible capacity of 610 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, showing good capacity rate. Therefore, solvent assisted both synthesis and further proper mixing enables high active material utilization whereas porous submicron channel of CNT network, which provides conducting pathway, adsorbs sulfur copolymer homogeneously for better electrochemical performance.

However, the practical application of LSB is hindered by capacity decay and low coulombic efficiency, mainly resulting from the insulation nature of sulfur and polysulfide shuttle effect. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative strategy for preparing the nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (N-GC), which can be utilized as sulfur host material in the LSB, by carbonization of an imine-linked covalent organic framework. Because of the high porosity and electrical conductivity of N-GC, the electrode with a high sulfur loading of 67.5 wt% exhibited a superior initial discharge capacity of 1598 mAh g(-1) at 0.03 C, excellent rate capacity of 869 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and good cycling performance with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency during cycling. These results demonstrate its outstanding electrochemical performance and implied that the N-GC has great potential to be used as a cathode material for high-performance LSBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

High integrity and consistent qualities of the large-scale sulfur cathode with high energy have to be ensured to construct reliable and practical lithium-sulfur batteries that could supersede advancing lithium-ion batteries. Here, facile and productive approaches are developed to mass-produce functional sulfur hosts and to fabricate large-scale sulfur cathode with high sulfur loading. The functional sulfur host is synthesized by anchoring polyethylenimine at the surface of commercially available carbon at inert conditions with a scale of more than 10 g per batch via simple solution method. Combining the functionalized sulfur host with a polyacrylic acid binder allows high integrity and uniformity of the high sulfur loading cathode to be fabricated in large dimensions. Followed by this approach, the sulfur cathode, 70 x 6 cm(2), is produced with the sulfur loading of > 4.3 mg cm(-2). It is found that 12 wt% of polyethylenimine in the functionalized sulfur host with polyacrylic acid is at optimal condition that presents stable electrochemical performances over 600 cycles.

In this work, we demonstrate that intrinsically hydrophilic magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles having surface hydroxyl groups can be used as effective additives to trap lithium polysulfides in the positive electrode. MgO nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the surface of the active sulfur, and the addition of MgO into the sulfur electrode resulted in an increase in capacity retention of the lithium-sulfur cell compared to a cell with pristine sulfur electrode. The improvement in cycling stability was attributed to the strong chemical interactions between MgO and lithium polysulfide species, which suppressed the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides and enhanced the utilization of the sulfur active material. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first demonstration of MgO as an effective functional additive to trap lithium polysulfides in lithium-sulfur cells.

Here, a dual polysulfide confinement strategy is designed by fabricating an in-situ N/P co-doped carbon, which is originating from versatile silk cocoons through a combined technology of phosphoric acid activation and carbonization and acts as both sulfur host and self-standing interlayer in Li-S batteries. The N/P co-doped porous carbon host (NPPC) provides both the physical restriction and chemical adsorption of polysulfides, while the polar interlayer is used as not only an efficient barrier for blocking polysulfides but also a second current collector, which can reuse the sulfur species, enhance the cycling stability and rate capacity. With this rational design, the NPPC/S cathode with the free-standing interlayer exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1412.6 MAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, outstanding cycling stability with the ultra-low capacity decay of 0.032% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1.0 C and splendid rate performance with 758.1 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C. Our work provides an ecofriendly and dual employed strategy for boosting the commercialization of Li-S batteries.

Herein, the intrinsic defect of graphene has been tailored by using plasma irradiation. The topological defective carbon structure is demystified into monovacancy and divacancy which effectively promote Li-S redox kinetics by selectively decelerating the generation of soluble high-order LiPSs and passingly promoting the conversion to final solid products. Theoretical prediction uncovers the selective manipulation of Li-S redox kinetics by defective graphene, facilitating the reduced overpotential effect and uniform deposition of Li2S. Moreover, the divacancy presents a higher activity for Li-S chemistry in contrast with monovacancy. Therefore, the battery achieves superior cyclability with a capacity retention of 88.6% at 1.0 C over 300 cycles. Furthermore, it yields an areal capacity up to 8.5 mAh cm(-2) with a sulfur loading of 13.3 mg cm(-2).

Hence, it is significant for Li-S battery to solve these disadvantages to boost the electrochemical performances and facilitate the popularization in various fields. Herein, we synthesized a conductive NiCo2O4@PPy micro-flower-like material via hydrothermal technique followed by subsequent in-situ vapor phase polymerization, and the material was assembled into Li-S batteries to obtain satisfactory electrochemical performances. Flower-like NiCo2O4 expedites the conversion of polysulfides through both physical adsorption and chemical anchoring. Polypyrrole can efficaciously confine polysulfides shuttling, increase the conductivity and concurrently promote lithium ions diffusion. NiCo2O4@PPy is simultaneously served as the effective cathode material and multi-functional interlayer for anchoring catalyzing polysulfides, which can exhibit a satisfying initial capacity of 1588 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, and the average coulomb efficiency is 95.2%. The highest discharge specific capacity of 740 mAh g(-1) is displayed at 2C and the capacity decay rate is 0.107% per cycle after 400 cycles. NiCo2O4@PPy composite is a favorable sulfur host material intimated by these new results, and it is also a competent candidate of interlayer in highperformance Li-S batteries.

However, challenges persist from the polysulfide-shuttle effect at the cathode. Soluble sulfur-based species in the cathode cross over to the lithium anode through the separator leading to fading capacity with cycling. This has spurred continuous effort by the scientific community to develop novel cathodes where sulfur species can affix better. A conductive nanostructured graphene network is a suitable candidate that can serve as a scaffold for holding sulfur nanoparticles. Here, a one-pot synthesis of chemically reduced graphene oxide networks prepared from easily accessible graphene oxide is demonstrated. The solution-based method simply allows for impregnation of the graphene oxide network with sulfur nanoparticles through a careful manipulation of pH of the chemical environment. Two routes were chosen for the precipitation of such sulfur nanoparticles: firstly, the dissolution of sulfur in sodium hydroxide into polysulfides followed by acidification and secondly, the acidification of sodium thiosulfate from alkaline media into sulfur nanoparticles. Both graphene oxide materials from the two routes were treated with sodium borohydride to achieve conductive graphene. The second route, with the sulfur nanoparticles derived from the acidification of sodium thiosulfate with chemically reduced graphene oxide, demonstrated favorable electrochemical behavior, showing promise as electrode material for Li-S batteries.

However, the severe self-discharge behavior of Li-S batteries strongly limits their use in practical applications. Here, we report a sustainable and highly porous polyacrylonitrile/graphene oxide (PAN/GO) nanofiber membrane separator that simultaneously enables large capacity and excellent anti-self-discharge capability for lithium-sulfur batteries. A low retention loss (5%) can be achieved even after a resting time of 24 h. Besides benefitting from the highly porous structure and excellent electrolyte wettability of the nanofiber separator, the improved performance can also be ascribed to the excellent barrier effects caused by the relatively high energy binding between -C equivalent to N and Li2S/polysulfides and the electrostatic interactions between GO and negatively charged species (S-n(2-)). It is, therefore, demonstrated that this GO incorporated PAN nanofiber separator with highly porous structure and excellent electrolyte wettability is a promising separator candidate for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, we fabricated electron bridging structure glued yolk-shell hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) nanospheres containing a microporous shell and a mesoporous core as cathode host for Li-S battery. In which, the inner mesoporous core acts as a sulfur reservoir to entrap polysulfide species, and the outer micropores shell provides not only large contact area between sulfur and conductive substrate, but also physical confinement and chemical adsorption to trap polysulfide. This yolk-shell HPC was further glued by an electron bridging structure consisting of carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated polyaniline (PANi), who can further suppress the shuttle effect benefit from PANi and afford a highly conductive network by affording a "point-to-plane" type electron transport mode instead of the "point-to-point". As a result, this designed cathode material exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 1372 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), and excellent cycling stability with a capacity decay of 0.083% per cycle over 500 cycles at 2 A g(-1). This strategy provides a promising approach for the design of multifunctional carbon materials for high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, a unique layered reinforced concrete structure (LRCS) is reported by integrating an ice-template method with incorporating carbon fibers in the thick electrodes for Li-S batteries. The LRCS enables aligned through-channel structure and intertwined conductive network, which lead to both fast kinetics of ions/electrons transport and strengthened electrode integrity to tolerate the volume change during cycling and the dimensional deformation under a high compaction density. Benefiting from the unique structure, the ultra-thick Se0.05S0.95 @ pPAN cathode (20.2 mg cm(-2)) delivers a high capacity of 10 mAh cm(-2) and excellent capacity retention of 80.8% over 140 cycles at a low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio of 2 and a negative-to-positive capacity ratio of 2.7, corresponding to a calculated energy density of 390 Wh kg(-1). This investigation not only provides guidance for the design of thick sulfur electrodes but also paves the way for the development of practical Li-S batteries.

Herein, a sacrificial template method by casting strategy is developed to prepare highly flexible and free-standing carbon film consisting of CNTs, graphene, or both. The scalable size, ultralight and binder-free characteristics, as well as the tunable process/property are promising for their large-scale applications, such as utilizing as interlayers in lithium sulfur battery. The capability of holding polysulfides (i.e., suppressing the sulfur diffusion) for the networks made from CNTs, graphene, or their mixture is pronounced, among which CNTs are the best. The diffusion process of polysulfides can be visualized in a specially designed glass tube battery. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of discharged electrodes was performed to characterize the species in electrodes. A detailed analysis of lithium diffusion constant, electrochemical impedance, and elementary distribution of sulfur in electrodes has been performed to further illustrate the differences of different carbon interlayers for Li-S batteries. The proposed simple and enlargeable production of carbon-based networks may facilitate their applications in battery industry even as a flexible cathode directly. The versatile and reconstructive strategy is extendable to prepare other flexible films and/or membranes for wider applications.

J	Zhao, H; Tian, BB; Su, CL; Li, Y				Zhao, Hang; Tian, Bingbing; Su, Chenliang; Li, Ying			Single-Atom Iron and Doped Sulfur Improve the Catalysis of Polysulfide Conversion for Obtaining High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						single-atom iron; electrocatalysis; energy barrier; polysulfide conversion; lithium-sulfur battery	REDOX; SULFIDE; CATHODE; DESIGN	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as promising secondary energy storage devices for their high energy density and low cost. The electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries is mainly determined by the efficient and reversible conversion of lithium-polysulfides to Li2S when discharging and to S when charging. Herein, a catalytic strategy is proposed to accelerate the reversible conversion of S and the discharge products in Li-S batteries. This reversible transformation is achieved with active sites of single-atom iron on nitrogen- and sulfur-doped porous carbon (FeNSC). We prove that the synergy between atomically dispersed iron and doped sulfur accelerates the reversible electrochemical conversion reactions in Li-S batteries. The FeNSC/S hybrid cathode exhibits superior long-term cycling stability even at a high current density of 1C, with only 0.047% capacity decay per cycle over 1000 cycles. This study demonstrates a novel method for improving the conversion of polysulfides based on electrocatalysis strategies to ultimately obtain high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, we have investigated the mechanism of the excellent activity of oxygenated g-C3N4 for Li-S batteries from theoretical perspective, and the further experiment confirms that our O-g-C3N4-S cathode exhibits much better electrochemical performance compared with those in previous reports. Our DFT calculations reveal that the oxygenated material has better electrical conductivity and stronger adsorption ability with the Li2Sx species compared with the pristine g-C3N4 and other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Furthermore, we have confirmed experimentally that the O-g-C3N4-S composite cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries with high reversible discharge capacity of 1030 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, great rate capability with the discharge capacity of 364 mAh g(-1) even at 5.0 C, and outstanding long-term cyclic stability with the discharge capacity of 465 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1.0 C (capacity decay was only 0.046% per cycle). Our results also suggest that theoretical study will play a significant role in predicting and screening novel materials with better performance.

The anchoring of LPSs to carbon combined with sulfur is a method of suppressing the shuttle effect. This first principles study is the first to report that amorphous carbon offers the best ability to anchor LPSs. The adsorption energies of LPSs on amorphous carbon are at least six times higher than those on graphene and at least two times higher than those on pyridinic-N doped graphene. The LPSs adsorbed on amorphous carbon undergo significant molecular distortion and/or partial dissociation due to the S-to-C electron transfer of 1.2-1.8 e per molecule, as well as the formation of strong bonds between both the Li and S atoms and the spand sp(2)-site C atoms. We propose an amorphous carbon-graphite hybrid anchoring material, because amorphous carbon can strongly capture LPSs and graphite can act as an electron channel.

However, their applications are impeded by shuttling of soluble polysulfides and sluggish conversion kinetics with inferior rate performance and short cycling life. Here, single-atom materials are designed to accelerate polysulfide conversion for Li- S batteries. Nitrogen sites in the structure not only anchor polysulfides to alleviate the shuttle effect but also enable high loading of single-atom irons. Density functional theory calculations indicate that single-atom sites reduce the energy barrier of electrochemical reactions and thus improve the rate and cycling performances of batteries. The coin battery shows impressive energy storage properties, including a high reversible capacity of 1379 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and a high rate capacity of 704 mAh g(-1) at 5 C. The ratio of electrolyte dosage/energy density is as low as 5.5 g Ah(1-). It exhibits excellent cycling performance with a capacity retention of 90% even after 200 cycles at 0.2 C.

The cathode with high sulfur areal loading is vital for the practical applications of Li-S batteries with very high energy density. However, the high sulfur loading in an electrode results in poor rate and cycling performances of batteries in most cases. Herein, we used diameters of 5.0 (D5) and 13.0 (D13) mm to probe the effect of electrodes with different sizes on the rate and cycling performances under a high sulfur loading (4.5 mg cm(-2)). The cell with D5 sulfur cathode exhibits better rate and cycling performances comparing with a large (D13) cathode. Both the high concentration of lithium polysulfides and corrosion of lithium metal anode impede rapid kinetics of sulfur redox reactions, which results in inferior battery performance of the Li-S cell with large diameter cathode.

Despite their strengths, LSBs suffer from the cross-over of soluble polysulfide redox species to the anode, entailing fast capacity fading and inferior cycling stability. Adding to the concern, the insulating character of polysulfides lends to sluggish reaction kinetics. To address these challenges, we construct optimized polysulfide blockers-cum-conversion catalysts by accommodating the battery separator with covalent organic framework@Graphene (COF@G) composites. We settle on a crystalline TAPP-ETTB COF in the interest of its nitrogen-enriched scaffold with a regular pore geometry, providing ample lithiophilic sites for strong chemisorption and catalytic effect to polysulfides. On another front, graphene enables high electron mobility, boosting the sulfur redox kinetics. Consequently, a lithium-sulfur battery with a TAPP-ETTB COF@G-based separator demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 1489.8 mA h g(-1)at 0.2 A g(-1) after the first cycle and good cyclic performance (920 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles) together with excellent rate performance (827.7 mA h g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)). The scope and opportunities to harness the designability and synthetic structural control in crystalline organic materials is a promising domain at the interface of sustainable materials, energy storage, and Li-S chemistry.

How to make full utilization of the mass produced CNTs as building blocks for nanocomposite electrodes is not well understood yet. Herein, a composite cathode containing commercial agglomerated multi-walled CNTs and S for Li-S battery was fabricated by a facile melt-diffusion strategy. The hierarchical CNT@S coaxial nanocables exhibited a discharging capacity of 1020 and 740 mAh.g(-1) at 0.5 and 2.0 C, respectively. A rapid capacity decay of 0.7% per cycle at the initial 10 cycles and a slow decay rate of 0.14% per cycle for the later 140 cycles were detected. Such hierarchical agglomerated CNT@S cathodes show advantages in easy fabrication, environmentally benign, low cost, excellent scalability, and good Li ion storage performance, which are extraordinary composites for high performance Li-S battery.

In the functional layers, the CNT films build a conductive framework, and the GO sheets form a support membrane for the uniform dispersion of BTO nanoparticles. BTO nanoparticles without ferroelectricity (nfBTO) can trap polysulfides more effectively by chemical interaction compared to BTO nanoparticles with ferroelectricity (fBTO). A Li-S cell with the nfBTO/GO@CNT functional layer exhibits a reversible capacity of 824.5 mA h g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.2 C. At a high sulfur loading of 5.49 mg cm(-2), an electrode with the functional layer shows an areal capacity of 5.15 mA h cm(-2) at 0.1 C, demonstrating the nfBTO/GO@CNT functional layer's potential in developing high-performance Li-S batteries.

Inspired by theoretical predictions, we herein validated the existence of a strong electrostatic affinity between polymeric carbon nitride (p-C3N4) and LiPSs, that can not only stabilize the redox cycling of LiPSs, but also enhance their redox kinetics. As a result, utilization of p-C3N4 in a Li-S battery has brought much improved performance in the aspects of high capacity and low capacity fading over prolonged cycling. Especially upon the application of p-C3N4, the kinetic barrier of the LIPS redox reactions has been significantly reduced, which has thus resulted in a better rate performance. Further density functional theory simulations have revealed that the origin of such kinetic enhancement was from the distortion of molecular configurations of the LiPSs anchored on p-C3N4. Therefore, this proof-of-concept study opens lip a promising avenue to improve the performance of Li-S batteries by accelerating their fundamental electrochemical redox processes, which also has the potential to be applied in other electrochemical energy storage/conversion systems.

Here, we propose the formation of a thin conformal Li-ion permeable oxide layer on the sulfur-carbon composite electrode surface by rapid plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) in order to prevent this dissolution, while preserving electrical connectivity within the individual electrode particles. PEALD synthesis offers a fast deposition rate combined with a low operating temperature, which allows sulfur evaporation during deposition to be avoided. After PEALD of a thin layer of aluminium oxide on the surface of electrode composed of large (ca. 10 mu m in diameter) S-infiltrated activated carbon fibers (S-ACF), significantly enhanced cycle life is observed, with a capacity in excess of 600 mAhg(-1) after 300 charge-discharge cycles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows a significant amount of redeposited lithium sulfides on the external surface of regular S-ACF electrodes. However, the PEALD alumina-coated electrodes show no lithium sulfide deposits on the fiber surface. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) studies of the electrodes' chemical composition further confirms that PEALD alumina coatings dramatically reduce S dissolution from the cathodes by confining the polysulfides inside the alumina barrier.

Conductive carbons are promising sulfur host materials for improving areal capacity in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, but they face a few congenital deficiencies, such as low tap density and weak polysulfide entrapment ability, resulting in poor volumetric performance. Here, we report one type of cathode system based on flower-like porous Ti3C2Tx (FLPT) without the incorporation of any carbon hosts or conductive additives. The resultant FLPT-S electrode synchronously acquires a high areal capacity of 10.04 mAh cm(-2) and ultrahigh volumetric capacity of 2009 mAh cm(-3). Furthermore, ex situ electron paramagnetic resonance and UV-visible spectra have demonstrated that FLPT enables a fast dynamic equilibrium between S-6(2-) anion and S-3(center dot-) radica during cycling, which promotes the redox reactions of sulfur species.

However, some prominent problems restrict the development of lithium-sulfur batteries, including poor intrinsic conductivity of sulfur, larger volume expansion, and the dissolution of polysulfide. Herein, the porous Zn-Co oxide derived from MOFs (metal-organic framework) coated by highly conductive MXene (ZnCo2O4@Ti3C2) is developed as an efficient sulfur immobilizer for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Benefitting from the high electronic conductivity of MXene, chemical binding sites of metal oxide for polysulfides, and porous structure for ion transfer, the ZnCo2O4@Ti3C2/S composite demonstrates a balanced high electrochemical performance. A high initial discharge capacity of 1283.9 mAh g(-1) with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 98.7% at a low current density of 0.1 C. In addition, this sample exhibits outstanding cycling performance at a high current density of 0.5 C. The results showed that the design strategy of MOFs-derived materials has great potential to promote the development of high-performance LSBs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, NiCoO2/NiCoP heterostructures with hollow nanocage morphology are prepared for efficient multifunctional Li-S batteries. The hollow nanocage structure exposes abundant active sites, traps lithium polysulfides and inhibits the shuttle effect. The NiCoO2/NiCoP heterostructure, combing strong adsorption capacity of NiCoO2 and excellent catalytic ability of NiCoP, facilitates the process of anchoring-diffusion-transfor mation of polysulfides. The successful construction of heterostructures reduces the reaction barrier, accelerating the lithium ion (Li+) diffusion rate and thus effectively enhancing the redox reaction kinetics. More importantly, NiCoO2/NiCoP heterostructure plays a role in self-cleaning that minimizes solid sulfur species accumulation to maintain surface clean during long cycling for a continuously catalysis of the polysulfides conversion reactions. With the merit of these features, the NiCoO2/NiCoP modified separator exhibits excellent cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.043% per cycle up to 1000 cycles at 2 C. The design of NiCoO2/NiCoP hollow nanocage heterostructures offers a new option for high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The 3DOHPPy possesses a large BET specific surface area (118.5m(2) g(-1)), 3D ordered interconnected macropores (240 nm) and mesopores (2-3 nm) on the macropore walls. The sulfur/3DOHPPy (S/3DOHPPy) composite is prepared by a solution-diffusion route followed by low-temperature heat treatment and studied as a cathode material for the lithium/sulfur (Li/S) battery. The resulting S/3DOHPPy cathode shows a high specific discharge capacity of 751 mAh g(-1) even after 100 cycles at 0.1 C and great rate capability. The superior electrochemical property of the S/3DOHPPy composite is ascribed to the unique hierarchical structure of 3DOHPPy with ordered interconnected macropores that benefit enhanced mass transfer and the small mesopores on the macropore walls that can immobilize the sulfur and polysulfides produced during the discharge/charge processes.

Nevertheless, several detrimental drawbacks, including shuttling effects caused by soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS), sluggish conversion kinetics between LiPS, and poor conductivities of sulfur, prevent commercialization of LSBs. To takle the above issues, MOF-derived cobalt disulfide/nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) composite polyhedrons linked with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), CoS2@NC/MWCNT, were developed as an effective sulfur host for LSBs. It was fabricated through first in-situ growth of nanoporous ZIF-67 on surface treated MWCNTs, followed by carbonization and sulfurization. CoS2@NC/MWCNT combines the advantages of outstanding conductivities of MWCNTs, excellent chemical adsorption of NC and CoS2 toward LiPS, and high catalytic efficiency of CoS2 toward LiPS conversion, effectively addressing the shuttling, sluggish conversion, and low conductivity issues. The CoS2@NC/MWCNT electrode delivered a high specific capacity of 1133 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and maintained a decent specific capacity of 607 mAh g(-1) at 2.0C. Its cycling stability is excellent, with a capacity retention rate of 77% after 300cycles at 1.0C, i.e., an average capacity decay rate of 0.078% per cycle. The cycling stability was further improved through increasing N-doping levels of the carbons for enhanced chemical adsorption toward LiPS and through incorporation of inter-linked reduced graphene oxide sheets as a physical barrier to reduce the diffusion loss of LiPS, achieving even smaller capacity decay rates of 0.066 and 0.064 % per cycle, respectively.

Nevertheless, some key challenges which are linked with polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics of polysulfide conversion are the main obstacles in the high electrochemical performance of LSBs. Here, a molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanobelt catalytic layer is fabricated on the separator to solve these issues. The MoO3 layer shows strong chemical interaction with polysulfides by successfully blocking the polysulfides on the separator from shuttling and significantly accelerates the redox reaction of polysulfide conversion. Furthermore, the randomly arranged layers of MoO3 nanobelts possess enough porous networks that provide effective space for electrolyte infiltration and facile pathway for fast ion transportation. The resultant LSBs exhibit a very high initial capacity of 1377 mAh g(-1). After 200 cycles at 0.5 C, the capacity is 684.4 mAh g(-1) with the fading rate of only 0.251% per cycle. Additionally, the MoO3 modification provides good surface protection of lithium anode and depresses the lithium anode degradation.

However, the "shuttle effect" caused by soluble long-chain lithium polysulfides (LiPS) has impeded further development of Li-S batteries. In this work, nanosized MoS2 quantum dots (MoS2 QDs) were decorated on three-dimensional (3D) structure of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form aerogels for sulfur host, in which the MoS2 QDs provide much more unsaturated bonds to enhance chemical absorption with LiPS and rGO acts as an electron transfer pathway as well as physical absorption with LiPS. Impressively, the rGO-MoS2 QDs/S electrodes have reached an ultra-low capacity fade rate of 0.011% per cycle during 300 cycles at 2 C with an average coulomic efficiency of nearly 100%.

Herein, we describe the synthesis of a nanocomposite structure comprising mesoporous tungsten carbide (meso-WC) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (meso-WC/rGO) and its application to an functional separator in LSBs. The resulting Li-S cell exhibits improved rate cycling performance: similar to 950 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 100 cycles. Moreover, even at a high sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm-2, the Li-S cell with the meso-WC/rGO maintains enhanced performance, with a capacity of similar to 737 mAh. g(-1) and a retention of 83% after 300 cycles. The Li-polysulfide shuttle effect was observed using H-type cells and adsorption tests. The enhanced performance results from suppression of the shuttle effect caused by the excellent adsorption of Li polysulfides, effective reuse of active materials, and promotion of the conversion reaction.

Herein, we report hollow carbon spheres with nanoporous shells and tailored chemical interfaces (PHCS) via annealing precursors under hydrogen contained inert gas as sulfur host to realize ultralong cycle life of lithium sulfur battery. The obtained PHCS has a larger pore volume, a higher specific surface area and less oxygen content compared to the conventional treated HCS. Benefiting from the combination of the unique pore structure and chemical interfaces which induce stronger polysulfides adsorption ability and less unwanted side reactions, which were confirmed by the ultravioletevisible (UV-vis) spectroscopy test and XPS measurement, the obtained PHCS/S cathode demonstrates excellent rate performance and ultralong cycle life. It delivers a high discharge capacity of 806.3 mAhg(-1) at 4C rate and an ultralong cycle life with a low capacity decay rate of 0.037% after 1500 cycles at 2C rate. Moreover, it also supports high sulfur content (82%) and high sulfur loading (7.2 mg cm(-2)) with good electrochemical performance. The EIS analysis and post-mortem SEM measurements further confirm that the PHCS/S cathode electrode has more stable resistance and morphology characteristics, and the corresponding lithium anode suffers from less structural destruction and volume expansion, which may lead to the excellent battery performance.

The NPCM/sulfur composite cathode material with the sulfur content of 53.5% shows high discharge capacity; the initial discharge capacity is 1274 mAh g(-1) which maintains as high as 776.4 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1 C current. At high current density of 1 C, the NPCM/sulfur cathode material still shows initial discharge capacity of 830.3 mAh g(-1), and the reversible capacity retention is 78% after 50 cycles. To study the influence of different sulfur content of NPCM/sulfur cathode material to the performance of Li-S battery, the different sulfur content of NPCM/sulfur composite cathode materials is prepared by changing the thermal diffusion time and the ratio of sulfur powder to NPCM. The performance of NPCM/sulfur cathode material with different sulfur content is studied at a current of 0.1 C, which will be very important to the preparation of high-performance sulfur/carbon cathode material with appropriate sulfur content.

In this work, we report a new type of hybrid sulfur host which is composed of Al(2)O(3)homogenously decorated in nitrogen-rich mesoporous carbon framework (NMC-Al2O3). The NMC-Al(2)O(3)hybrid host features a poly-dispersed spherical morphology and a mesoporous configuration with high surface area and large pore volume that can accommodate a high sulfur content up to 73.5 wt.%. As a result, the fabricated NMC-Al2O3-S cathode exhibits all-round improvements in electrochemical properties in term of capacities (1,212 mAh center dot g(-1)at 0.2 C; 755 mAh center dot g(-1)at 2 C), cycling charge-discharge reversibility (sustainably 100% efficiencies) and stability (1,000 cycles with only 0.023% capacity decay per cycle at 0.5 C). By contrast, the Al2O3-free NMC-S cathode shows both decreased capacities and rapidly descending Coulombic efficiencies during cycling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the implanted Al(2)O(3)can greatly enhance the chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion for various lithium polysulfides and thereby effectively prevent the polysulfide shuttling and significantly improve the utilizability, reversibility and stability of sulfur cathode.

However, the lack of cathode active materials with appropriate electrical conductivities and stability coupled with an inexpensive and industrially compatible production process has so far hindered the development of practical devices. Here, a facile preparation pathway is reported for the production of a sulfur-carbon composite active material by drying a mixture of highly conductive few-layer graphene (FLG) flakes (produced by exploiting an innovative wet jet milling process with a yield of approximate to 100 % and production capability of approximate to 23.5 g h(-1)) with elemental sulfur, using ethanol as an environmentally friendly solvent. The designed sulfur-FLG composite shows excellent electrochemical results. The assembled lithium-sulfur battery exhibits a stable rate capability up to a current rate of 2C, a coulombic efficiency approaching 100 % for 300 cycles at the current rate of C/4 (420 mA g(-1)), and a long cycle life up to 500 cycles delivering around 600 mAh g(-1) at 2C (3350 mA g(-1)).

A ferrous sulfide-stabilized S-hollow carbon sphere group (BP2000-FeS-S) was fabricated by supporting conductive ferrous sulfide (FeS) into a hollow carbon sphere group (BP2000), followed by traditional wet-impregnating of S. The BP2000 host physically confines LiPSs while FeS is anchored inside BP2000 and further chemically interact with LiPSs through bonding with FeS. Meanwhile, FeS acts as the filling inside the hole of BP2000 adjusting an appropriate aperture size to restricting the drain of S/LiPSs. The BP2000-FeS-S cathode displayed reversible capacity of 1206.2 mA h g (1) at 0.1 C and capacity could be maintained at 691.7 mA h g (1) after more than 500 progressive cycles at a current density of 0.5 C. What's more, the BP2000-FeS-S cathode could output a capacity up to 659.2 mA h g (1) even at a current density of 2 C. This strategy can be widely extended to other kinds of metal sulfides or nitrides and probably be used widely. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The porous conductive polymer skin layer effectively prevents the dissolution of active sulfur and facilitates the diffusion of lithium ion towards to reaction site, due to the shortened diffusion distance. Moreover, this resulting architecture structure, Polyphenylene/S/MWCNTs, can accommodate the large volumetric expansion of sulfur during lithiation procedure, improving the cycling stability and rate capability of lithium-sulfur batteries. It delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1491.3 mAh/g at 0.1 C, and the remaining capacity is 1015.6 mAh/g after 75 cycles. The as-prepared material also exhibits an excellent rate capability and cyclability at 0.5 C, 1 C and 5 C. Our experimental results manifest that this composite is a potential candidate as cathode material for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

When S is encapsulated in PHNS (S@PHNS) with an optimum shell structure and used as the cathode, surprisingly, a specific capacity as high as 1500.5 mA h.g(-1) in the first discharge at a current rate of 0.1 C with high coulombic efficiency as well as excellent rate performance is achieved. Also, a reversible capacity as high as 536.5 mA h.g(-1) is obtained even at a high current rate of 5 C. Such a PHNS with the ultra-thin wrinkled shell has good conductivity, short ion and electron transport channel, and fast kinetics characteristics and especially during the charge-discharge cycles, it is conducive to the access of electrolyte and effective accommodation of the volume change. This PHNS should be a promising alternative cathode material for lithium-Sulfur batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the microstructure of CA was easy to collapse and shrink during carbonization, resulting in a dramatically drop in specific surface area and porosity. Herein, graphene nanosheets (GNs) were introduced in CA to reinforce the structural stability. As-prepared CA/GNs composites were fabricated from in-situ polymerization of resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) in graphene oxide (GO) solution. It was found that the mass concentration of the GO solution had a significantly positive effect on hierarchical porous structure of the CA/GNs composites, which presented improve the electrochemical performances due to the combination of micro-, meso- and macro-pores. It is worth noting that the CA/GNs0.1 sample, obtained from 10 wt % GO solution, possessed the largest specific surface area of 665.477 m(2) g(-1) and the largest pore volume of 0.912 cm(3) g(-1). Especially, after incorporated with moderate amount of S (58.86 wt %), the CA/GNs0.1/S cathode exhibited the best electrochemical performances (initial discharging capacity of 1501 mAh g 1 at 0.1C and reversible capacities of 471 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles and 341 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C). This was attributed to the tunable hierarchical porous microstructure of the CA/GNs0.1 sample. Unfortunately, when increased the S content to 68.39 wt %, the electrochemical performance deteriorated in all aspects because of their sluggish reaction kinetics. These all results suggested that introducing GNs can feasibly enhance the performance of CA as matrix in Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, these issues are significantly relieved by introducing polar SnO2, or SnS2 species into the S/C composite. SnO2- or SnS2-stabilized sulfur in porous carbon composites (SnO2/S/C and SnS2/S/C) have been obtained through a baked-in-salt or sealed-in-vessel approach at 245 degrees C, starting from metallic tin (mp 231.89 degrees C), excess sulfur, and porous carbon. Both of the in situ-formed SnO2 and SnS2 in the two composites could ensure chemical interaction with lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates proven by theoretical calculation. Compared to SnO2/S/C, the SnS2/S/C sample affords a more appropriate binding effect and shows lower charge transfer resistance, which is important for the efficient redox reaction of the adsorbed LiPS intermediates during cycling. When used as cathodes for Li-S batteries, the SnS2/S/C composite with sulfur loading of 78 wt % exhibits superior electrochemical performance. It delivers reversible capacities of 780 mAh after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. When further coupled with a Ge/C anode, the full cell also shows good cycling stability and efficiency.

The resulted ZIF-67@rGO composite possesses a hierarchical architecture, in which ZIF-67 polyhedron closely clustered and coated by rGO. The rGO coating shell could maintain the structural stability and provide high conductivity paths for effective charge transport. The ZIF-67 core possesses abundant adsorptive site to provide chemical interaction with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The size range of ZIF-67@rGO particles is about 2-5 mu m, and the diameters of ZIF-67 nanoparticles are distributed between 500 and 900 nm. As results, the S/ZIF-67@rGO composite achieved the high initial discharge capacity of 1130.1 mAh g(-1) and a capacity of 942.6 mAh g(-1) remained after 100 cycles. This facile approach of spray-drying will open an alternative pathway to prepare an efficient and promising electrode material for advanced Li-S batteries.

However, low conductivity of the sulfur cathode, dissolution, and poor conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are the key challenges. Herein crispy rice-like nanoparticle assembled mesoporous MoO2 microrods derived from metal organic frameworks and wrapped with graphene (MoO2/rGO) are fabricated, exhibiting high electron and lithium ion conductivity from the inherent metallic conductivity for MoO2 and mesoporous-structural microrod morphology, physical confinement for LiPSs through mesopores, chemical adsorption, and catalytic conversion of LiPSs by formation of thiosulfates (polythionates) due to moderate redox potential for MoO2. The S-MoO2/rGO cathode shows a discharge capacity of 1145 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and keeps at 1027 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles, corresponding to an average capacity decay rate of 0.02% per cycle. Specifically, an ultralong cycling life with a low capacity decay of 0.016% only over 3200 cycles at 3.0C is the best performance in long-life Li-S batteries among reported sulfur hosts.

Elemental sulfur has been loaded to the micropores through a solution infiltration method to form RHAC@S nanocomposite. The resulted RHAC@S nanocomposite with 0.25 and 0.38 mg.cm(-1) of sulfur loading have been tested as novel cathodes for Li-S batteries. The 0.25 mg.cm(-1) sulfur loading sample shows an initial discharge capacity of 1080 mA.h.g(-1) at 167.5 mA g(-1). After 50 cycles of charge/discharge test at the current density of 0.2C, the reversible capacity maintains at 312 mA.h.g(-1). The material has delivered a capacity of more than 300 mA.h.g(-1) at 284.75 mA g(-1).

Here, a P-doped nickel tellurium electrocatalyst with Te-vacancies (P subset of NiTe2-x) anchored on maize-straw carbon (MSC) nanosheets, served as a functional layer (MSC/P subset of NiTe2-x) on the separator of high-performance Li-S batteries. The P subset of NiTe2-x electrocatalyst enhanced the intrinsic conductivity, strengthened the chemical affinity for polysulfides, and accelerated sulfur redox conversion. The MSC nanosheets enabled NiTe2 nanoparticle dispersion and Li+ diffusion. In situ Raman and ex situ X-ray absorption spectra confirmed that the MSC/P subset of NiTe2-x restrained the shuttle effect and accelerated the redox conversion. The MSC/P subset of NiTe2-x-based cell has a cyclability of 637 mAh g(-1) at 4 C over 1800 cycles with a degradation rate of 0.0139% per cycle, high rate performance of 726 mAh g(-1) at 6 C, and a high areal capacity of 8.47 mAh cm(-2) under a sulfur configuration of 10.2 mg cm(-2), and a low electrolyte/sulfur usage ratio of 3.9. This work demonstrates that vacancy-induced doping of heterogeneous atoms enables durable sulfur electrochemistry and can impact future electrocatalytic designs related to various energy-storage applications.

However, the shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) limit their practical application. Herein, B-doped MoS2 nanosheets are synthesized on carbon nanotubes (denoted as CNT@MoS2-B) to function as catalysts to boost the performance of Li-S batteries. The poor catalytic performance of the pristine MoS2 is revealed to be the result of unsuitable orbital orientation of the basal plane, which hinders the orbital overlap with sulfur species. B in CNT@MoS2-B is sp(3) hybridized, and it has a vacant sigma orbital perpendicular to the basal plane, which can maximize the head-on orbital overlap with S. The incorporation of B significantly increases the reactivity of MoS2 basal plane, which can facilitate the kinetics of Li2S formation and dissolution. With these merits, the S/CNT@MoS2-B cathodes deliver high rate capability and outstanding cycling stability, holding great promise for both scientific research and practical application. This work affords fresh insights for developing effective catalysts to accelerate LIPS conversion.

Herein, sulfur-rich side chains are anchored onto Schiff-base copolymer of thiourea aldehyde resin (cp (S-TAR)) nanosheets via inverse vulcanization to form a large number of intermolecular crosslinkers as well as mesopores. Application of the resultant copolymer as a cathode material in Li-S batteries can not only provide abundant porous channels for Li+ diffusion but also significantly alleviate the dissolution of polysulfides by chemical confinement through the covalent bonds between sulfur-rich side chains and TAR. With this novel polymer cathode, a Li-S battery prototype is constructed which can operate at 1 C for over 500 charge-discharge cycles at nearly 99% coulombic efficiency, showing an ultralow cyclic fading rate of 0.045% per cycle, and an outstanding high-rate response of up to 5 C. The present strategy demonstrates the great potential of using highly crosslinked organosulfur copolymers as high-performance polymer cathode materials for low-cost, high-energy density Li-S batteries.

Preventing the shuttle of polysulfides and maintaining the high sulfur content are two of the primary challenges. 3D sulfur doped graphene (S-3DG) not only promises enough space to accommodate sulfur, but also increases the binding of polysulfides intermediates through chemical bonding. However, strategies for constructing sulfur doped 3D sulfur/graphene (S-3DG/S) are either complex or involve toxic reagents. The sulfur-containing decolorizer (NaHSO3) as heteroatom doping source as well as reducer is utilized in synthesis S-3DG/S for lithium sulfur batteries via one-pot method. The results show that sulfur is successfully introduced into the 3DG/S framework with S-doped content of 1.8 wt%. The S-3DG/S composites with high loading (80 wt%) of sulfur deliver a high capacity retention of 93.9% after 100 cycles and demonstrate a low capacity-decay rate of 0.085% per cycle after 350 cycles at 0.5 C rate. This low-cost and scalable method paves a novel way to the practical application of Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the span of 12 years, extensive efforts have been devoted to the scientific and technological solutions to its inherent drawbacks, including electrically isolated nature of S and Li2S, severe shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and large volume change from S to Li2S upon lithiation. Moreover, the latest research realm of sulfur cathode is frequently emphasized towards its validity in practical applications. In this review, we focus exclusively on a research roadmap of 12 years in sulfur cathode development. We begin with a retrospect of the major conceptions and breakthroughs in different aspects to advance sulfur cathode. Additionally, we detail the major contributions from various countries, institutions, corresponding authors, journals and patents. Herein, we hope to give a comprehensively evolutionary story of sulfur cathode and new insight into the future direction of sulfur cathode, namely, carbon architecture design of sulfur host, advanced characterization techniques for in-depth mechanism understanding and full-cell evaluation for a truly viable LSB. We believe more researches into sulfur cathode should be warranted to understand relevant material chemistries, interfaces and engineering present in the LSBs, consequently bringing in numerous opportunities for battery scientists.

In this report, we introduced an effective strategy to immobilize soluble polysulfides by insertion/extraction of polysulfides into/from polyaniline (PANI). Two kinds of C-S@PANI composites, proton acid-doped PANI and proton acid dedoped PANI, were synthesized and utilized to assemble batteries, and their electrochemical properties were carefully compared by CV, FT-IR, and EQCM experiments. It is found that C-S@PANI composite with dedoped PANI delivers higher specific capacity and elegant cycle stability compared with the C-S@PANI with doped PANI composite. Polysulfides can be reversibly inserted into and extracted from dedoped PANI chains during the charge/discharge process, indicating a confining effect of polysulfides. In contrast, polysulfides could not easily insert into or extract from doped PANI with very poor solubility. Therefore, the immobilizing of polysulfides combined with good solubility of dedoped PANI, less side reaction between dedoped PANI and polysulfides and no corrosion of the current collector, gives the C-S@PANI composite with dedoped PANI good performance in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, the authors prepared a yolk-shell structured N-doped carbon nanotubes/sulfur/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanotube (N-CNTs/S@PEDOT) composite as a cathode for LSBs. The yolk-shell structure with void spaces can effectively buffer the volume expansion of sulfur, while the outer 'shell' can act as a physical barrier to minimise the 'shuttle effects' of LPSs. Moreover, the N-CNTs with high conductivity and superior structural stability are able to improve the electron transfer efficiency and cycling performance. Therefore, the specially designed yolk-shell structured N-CNTs/S@PEDOT composite cathode exhibits an extraordinary rate performance and enhanced cycling stability (602 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C).

However, during the charge-discharge reaction, the shuttle effect of the reaction intermediate polysulfides leads to a decrease in battery activity, which limits its development and commercialization. In this paper, we prepared a novel ZnO/N/Ketjen Black (KB) composite to act as a separator barrier to reduce the influence of polysulfides shuttle effects. A simple aqueous solution reaction was used to mix Zn(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O with KB and ZIF-8/KB was obtained by adding dimethylimidazole, and then ZIF-8/KB precursor was carbonized at high temperature in inert gas atmosphere to obtain ZnO/N/KB composite. Finally, the prepared ZnO/N/KB composite was coated on commercial PE separator. Through the dual effects of adsorption and catalysis, the shuttle effect of polysulfides is sufficiently inhibited by the ZnO/N/KB layer, therefore the electrochemical performances of lithium-sulfur batteries are largely improved. The results show that when the sulfur cathode of Li-S battery contains 3 mg cm(-2) active material, the specific discharge capacity can be as high as 1284.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 degrees C. Furthermore, at a higher rate of 0.5 degrees C, the initial discharge specific capacity also reaches 868.3 mAh g(-1). After 400 cycles of the charge/discharge process, it still remains 495.9 mAh g(-1), which means a capacity retention rate of 57.1%.

Designing highly efficient electrocatalysts with a core-shell like structure for accelerating polysulfide conversion is vital for the development of Li-S batteries. Herein, core-shell MoSe2@C nanorods are proposed to manipulate electrocatalytic polysulfide redox kinetics, thereby improving the Li-S battery performance. The 1D MoSe2@C is synthesized via a facile hydrothermal and subsequent selenization reaction. The electrocatalysis of MoSe2 is confirmed by the analysis of symmetric batteries, Tafel curves, changes of activation energy, and lithium-ion diffusion. Density functional theory calculations also prove the low Gibbs free energy of the reaction pathway and the lithium-ion diffusion barrier. Therefore, the Li-S batteries using MoSe2 electrocatalyst exhibit an excellent rate performance of 560 mAh g(-1) at 1 C with a high sulfur loading of 3.4 mg cm(-2) and an areal capacity of 4.7 mAh cm(-2) at a high sulfur loading of 4.7 mg cm(-2) under lean electrolyte conditions. This work provides a deeper insight into regulation of polysulfide redox kinetics in electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries.

Herein, to address these issues, we report an ultra-durable composite gel electrolyte (u-CGE) that is capable of simultaneously stabilizing lithium metal anode and sulfur cathode. The u-CGE matrix is achieved via integrating zein protein nanofibers on super flexible nitrogen-doped carbon nanofabric leading to super mechanical durability and excellent electrolyte wettability/uptake. The resulting u-CGEs show high ionic conductivity (2.1 x 10(-3) S/cm), Li-ion transfer number (0.68), and excellent interfacial compatibility. Furthermore, benefiting from pyrrolic/pyridinic nitrogen (e.g. 15 wt%) on carbon structure and polar groups of zein protein nanofibers, the u-CGE effectively suppresses the growth of lithium dendrite and loss of active sulfur. As a result, long-lived (600 h) symmetric Li/Li cells with the u-CGEs display stable performance even at high current rates. More significantly, armed with the resulting u-CGE, the Li-S battery exhibits excellent rate stability (953 mAh/g at 2 A/g), in addition to the dramatically enhanced capacity and cycling stability.

Herein, a rapid thermal expansion-triggered gas-assisted exfoliation method is applied to synthesize ultra-thin 2D V2O5 nanosheets. Unlike other methods, no impurities can be introduced during exfoliation, leading extremely clean 2D nanosheets that are crucial for the investigation of 2D materials in charge-storage fields. The obtained V2O5 nanosheets were used as effective host materials for polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries, as they can help to confine and alleviate the shuttle of polysulfides efficiently. The asprepared V2O5-S composite electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1638.5 mAh g(-1)- with a high Coulombic efficiency of 96.7% and maintained a specific capacity of 838.8 mAh g(-1)- after 200 cycles at 0.1 C current rate. This work supplies a facile approach to obtain transition metal oxides nanosheets, which have potential applications in energy storage and conversion fields.

However, the short cycle life and poor lithium transport kinetics are restricted its real-world applications. Hence, the combination of electrospinning technology and subsequent hydrothermal method acts as an effective strategy to synthesize the ultrafine zinc ferrite nanoparticles decorated on nitrogen functionalized porous carbon nanofibers (ZFO/NCFs). Three-dimensional ZFO/NCFs act as self-standing electrode for Li-S batteries. The presence of ZFO nanoparticles is beneficial for adsorbing lithium polysulfides and inhibiting the shuttle effect. Additionally, ZFO nanoparticles exhibit an excellent catalytic effect of the polysulfides conversion in redox reactions. As a result, the cell of ZFO/NCFs delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1100.8 mAh g (1) and after 300 cycles the discharge capacity reaches 789.7 mAh g (1) (coulombic efficiency: average 98.7%) at 0.2 C under 5.75 mg sulfur loading. Moreover, the initial capacity of ZFO/NCFs is 10.23 mAh and remains 7.21 mAh at 12.15 mg sulfur loading after 120 cycles. Hence, ZFO/NCFs contribute to adsorption and catalysis, which shows a promising exploration for the design of cathode materials of Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The existing two types of synthesis mutes to fabricate hollow structures include vapor processing route and solution processing route. Herein, we report a new and facile solvent-free template (SFT) synthetic strategy for the synthesis of SnO2/C hybrid hollow spheres by mixing and heating solid raw materials, in which 3-aminophenol/formaldehyde (APP) resin spheres and Tin salt have been used as hard template and precursor, respectively. During heating, Tin salt is melted and the ions can diffuse into the insides of APF spheres easily, leading to effective loading ions, thus to successfully shape replication of template. Sulfur cathode containing the asprepared porous SnO2/C hybrid hollow spheres exhibited superior electrochemical performances for lithium-sulfur batteries. The present SPT strategy will pave a new avenue for the synthesis of mixed carbon/metal oxides hollow spheres and their promising application in different areas.

However, they are still hindered by serious capacity decay on cycling caused by the dissolution of redox intermediates. Here, we designed a unique structure with polypyrrole (ppy) inserting into the graphene oxide (GO) sheet for accommodating sulfur. Such a sulfur host not only exhibits a good electronic and ionic conductivity, but also can suppress polysulfide dissolution effectively. With this advanced design, the composite cathode showed a high specific capacity of 548.4 mA.h.g(-1) at 5.0 C. A stable Coulombic efficiency of similar to 99.5% and a capacity decay rate as low as 0.089% per cycle along with 300 cycles at 1.0 C were achieved for composite cathodes with 78 wt.% of S. Besides, the interaction mechanism between PPy and lithium polysulfides (LPS) was investigated by density-functional theory (DFT), suggesting that only the polymerization of N atoms can bind strongly to Li ions of LPS rather than single N atoms. The 3D structure GO-PPy host with high conductivity and excellent trapping ability to LPS offered a viable strategy to design high-performance cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Herein, perovskite bimetallic hydroxide (CoSn(OH)(6)) nanocages are prepared, which are further wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the catalytic host for sulfur. Because of the coordinated valence state of Co and Sn and the intrinsic defect of the perovskite structure, such bimetallic hydroxide delivers moderate adsorption ability and enhanced catalytic activity toward LiPS conversion. Coupled with the hollow structure and the wrapped rGO as double physical barriers, the redox reaction kinetics, and sulfur utilization are effectively improved with such a host. The assembled battery delivers a good rate performance with a high capacity of 644 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and long stability with a capacity decay of 0.068% per cycle over 600 cycles at 1 C. Even with a higher sulfur loading of 3.2 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 mu L mg(-1), the battery still shows high sulfur utilization and good cycling stability.

We report the synthesis of mesoporous graphene-silica composite (m-GS) as a supporting material of sulfur for Li-S batteries. The ordered porous silica structure was synthesized parallel to functionalized graphene sheets (FGSs) through the ternary cooperative assembly of the graphene, silica, and block copolymer precursors. The well-defined, unique mesoporous structure integrates the electronic conductivity of graphene and the dual functions of silica as a structure building block and in situ polysulfide ab-/ad-sorbing agent to give a Li-S battery that has both good retention ability of polysulfides and good rate capability.

Here, we develop iron phosphide nanoparticles/reduced graphene oxide composites (FeP/rGO) as sulfiphilic host materials, which not only immobilize the polysulfides but also facilitate the fast charge transport kinetics, contributing to the reduced polarization and effective adsorption-diffusion-conversion interface of polysulfides. Moreover, the superficial oxidation of FeP nanoparticles helps to enhance the catalytic effect, facilitating a higher coulombic efficiency. As a consequence, the optimized S@FeP/rGO exhibits a high initial capacity of 1467 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C with a sulfur utilization of 87.7% and stable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 646 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading of 6.1 mg cm(-2), the cell can still deliver an initial capacity of 835 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. In addition, the modified separator using FeP/rGO composites also exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The current work provides a proof-of-concept study and practical application of S@FeP/rGO positive electrode in the lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Novel carbon cathode materials offer high sulfur loading, sulfur utilization and cycle stability. An often neglected aspect is that sulfur loading and amount of electrolyte strongly impact the performance. In this paper, we demonstrate how the amount of electrolyte, sulfur loading, lithium excess and cycling rate influences the cycle stability and sulfur utilization. We chose vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VA-CNT) as model system with a constant areal loading of carbon. For a high reproducibility, decreased weight of current collector and good mechanical adhesion of the VA-CNTs we present a layer transfer technique that enables a light-weight sulfur cathode. The sulfur loading of the cathode was adjusted from 20 to 80 wt.-%. Keeping the total amount of electrolyte constant and varying the C-rate, we are able to demonstrate that the capacity degradation is reduced for high rates, high amount of electrolyte and low sulfur loading. In addition idle periods in the cycling regiment and lower rates result in an increased degradation. We attribute this to the redox-reaction between reactive lithium and polysulfides that correlates with the cycling time, rather than cycle number. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, several critical issues remain which restrict their practical applications, especially the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides. Herein, we designed a lightweight multifunctional layer comprising reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and cobalt/nitrogen co-doped carbon nanofibers (Co-N-C) to modified the polypropylene (PP) separator to facilitate the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. The Co-N-C/rGO layer with abundant mesopores possesses strong immobilization ability of polysulfides and high electronic conductivity, which could work as an intrinsic physical/chemical frame work barrier and an upper current collector to trap and reutilize the polysulfides. Consequently, the Li-S battery with the modified Co-N-C/rGO/PP separator exhibits excellent cycling performance and good rate capability. A high discharge capacity of 1344 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, 658 mAh g(-1) at 5 C and a low capacity degradation rate of 28.8% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C were obtained. These exciting results indicate that this multifunctional Co-N-C/rGO/PP separator could be a promising separator candidate for Li-S batteries.

Here, a novel functionalized separator has been designed to trap the dissolved polysulfide by the facile strategy of functional coated separator which combining covalent organic frameworks with interlude Carbon Nanotubes network (COF-CNT-separator). Notably, it acts as an ionic sieve in Li-S batteries and a house for polysulfide, which selectively sieves Li+ ions and successfully confine the polysulfide within the cathode region. The battery exhibited a high reversible capacity of 1068 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) after the first cycle and capacity of 621 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles (sulfur content of 80% in cathode). When its high and low temperature performance were investigated, it finds that Li-S battery is suitable for a wide range of temperatures, from -10 to 50 degrees C, delivering a high utilization rate of sulfur, an excellent rate and cycle performance, and outstanding life cycle. Therefore, this facile strategy of combining separator with special network is an effective candidate for achieving high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, poor electrochemical performance, mainly attributed to polysulfide diffusion, obstructs their practical application. Herein, a simple graphite-modified separator with a preformed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is first fabricated to suppress the polysulfide shuttle. Particularly, the formed SEI film on the graphite surface inhibits the graphite exfoliation caused by co-intercalation of solvents. Thus, the stable graphite layer with a preformed SEI can function as an effective physical barrier to suppress the polysulfide shuttle and enhance the utilization of the trapped active material. As a result, the cell using the graphite-modified separator exhibits a high capacity of 698mAhg(-1) (0.2C) after 100 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.13% per cycle. Even under relatively high sulfur loading (2.5mgcm(-2)), it shows a reversible capacity of 519mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles.

Cyclability of sulfur/dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile composite cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium sulfur battery; Sulfur content; Cathode; Cyclability; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy	CARBON NANOTUBES; SPRAY-PYROLYSIS; HIGH-CAPACITY; PERFORMANCE; COMBINATION; DISCHARGE	Sulfur/dehydrogenated polyacrylonitrile composite has been studied as cathode material for lithium-sulfur rechargeable batteries. Nonetheless, capacity fading has been a challenge for the commercialization of batteries. In this study, characterization techniques of scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to investigate the change of cathode properties with charge-discharge cycles. Elemental analysis reveals that sulfur accumulates on the surface of the composite at the end of charge, and the sulfur formation decreases with cycle number. Scanning electron microscopy observations indicate that cathode surface morphology changes significantly after several cycles. By modeling the electrochemical impedance spectra of the cell in different discharge states, we suggest that capacity fading arises mainly from the formation and accumulation of irreversible Li2S (and Li2S2) on the cathode surface.

Herein, a strategy of reactive Li2S collaborated with dual-directional Fe3C electrocatalyst is proposed to achieve fast and continuous conversion of sulfur species for drastically boosting the performance of Li-S batteries. During the reduction process, reactive Li2S with unique three-dimensional porous structure is precipitated on Fe3C surface, which not only shortens ion/electron diffusion path but also exposes and retains more active sites in Fe3C. While for the following oxidation process, Fe3C also promotes the decomposition of reactive Li2S to refresh electrocatalyst surface. Therefore, the high catalytic activity of Fe3C is well retained during the entire electrochemical process, as verified by comprehensive experimental and theoretical calculation results. Eventually, Fe3C enables stable operation of high-areal-capacity Li-S batteries (> 6.0 mAh cm(-2)) under a wide-temperature range (-10 to 40 degrees C). Our strategy of coupling reactive Li2S with a bidirectional electrocatalyst provides a new avenue for developing high-energy and wide-temperature Li-S batteries.

Thus far, there is a lack of cost-effective strategies to characterize the comprehensive properties of interlayers and understanding of the roles that the interlayer properties play in the battery performance. Herein, we design a surfactant-controlled strategy to tune the structures/properties of the interlayers and establish the relationships among structure, property, and performance through comprehensive characterizations. It is surprisingly found that only with a specific surfactant, gelatin protein, a robust and self-assembled porous graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) interlayer can be achieved. Meanwhile, benefiting from the rich functional groups of protein, the protein functionalization of GNPs leads to not only good adhesion to a separator for the GNPs interlayer but also strong polysulfide-trapping ability. As a result, by adding the protein-functionalized GNPs interlayer to a Li-S battery, the electrochemical performance is obviously enhanced, owing to the abilities of the interlayer for trapping polysulfides and facilitating ion transport simultaneously. This study correlates the physicochemical properties of interlayers with their electrochemical performance and is of universal significance for design and fabrication of advanced battery interlayers.

To improve the performance of all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries, it is essential to raise both the reactivity of sulfur and the ionic conductivity of the positive composite electrode. For achieving this, we investigate a positive composite electrode prepared using P2S5 and a solid electrolyte with a high ionic conductivity. As a result, we have found that the lithium-sulfur cell exhibits a relatively low activation energy together with high ionic conductivity. The positive composite electrode exhibits an extremely high capacity of 1550 mA h g(-1) (sulfur) at 13 mA cm(-2) and 25 degrees C. Moreover, when using the positive electrode, the energy densities at the cell level (18650) are 540 W h kg(-1) and 990 W h L-1, estimated from the equivalent structure of a current lithium-ion battery.

However, the poor conductivity of sulfur, undesirable dissolution, and shuttling of lithium polysulfides are still main challenges for a practical application. Herein, a chemical plating method was developed to encapsulate sulfur microspheres within a porous Ag-based thin shell of ca. 67nm in thickness (denoted as S@Ag microcomposites). The sulfur content in the S@Ag particles is 89 wt%. With such structural and compositional merits, the core-shell composites can effectively facilitate the electron transfer and alleviate the polysulfide dissolution. When utilized as cathode in Li-S batteries, the S@Ag microcomposites exhibit good electrochemical performance, featured by an initial charge capacity of 1231 mAhg(-1) and a capacity of 922 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. The electrochemical performance of commercial S particles was also improved after treated by this chemical plating method. This study provides a simple and novel approach to fabricate S composite cathodes with high S content and promising electrochemical properties.

However, a large overpotential (similar to 1 V) is usually needed to activate microsized Li2S particles due to their low electronic and ionic conductivities. Here, nano-Li2S/carbon paper electrodes are developed via a simple Li2S solution filtration method. Li2S nanocrystals with a size less than 10 nm are formed uniformly in the pores of carbon paper network. These electrodes show an unprecedented low potential difference (0.1 V) in the first and following charges, also show high discharge capacities, good rate capability, and excellent cycling performance. More specifically, the nano-Li2S/carbon nanotube paper electrodes show a reversible capacity of 634 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 92.4% at 1C rate from the 4th to 100th cycle, corresponding to a low capacity fading rate of 0.078% per cycle. These results demonstrate a facile and scalable electrode fabrication process for making high performance nano-Li2S/carbon paper electrodes, and the superior performance makes them promising for use with lithium metal-free anodes in rechargeable Li-S batteries for practical applications.

To address this issue, in the present study, a TiO2/porous carbon (TiO2/PC) composite-coated Celgard 2400 separator was successfully fabricated and used as a polysulfide barrier for the Li/S battery. In TiO2/PC, the highly conductive PC with three-dimensional ordered porous structure physically constrains polysulfides and at the same time serves as an additional upper current collector. On the other hand, the TiO2 on the surface of PC chemically adsorbed polysulfides during the charge/discharge process. Due to the physical and chemical adsorption properties of TiO2/PC composite coating layer, an initial discharge capacity of 926mAhg(-1) at 0.1 C and a low fading rate (75% retention after 150cycles) were achieved. Moreover, in the rate capability test, the discharge capacity for the TiO2/PC-modified Li/S battery was recovered to 728mAhg(-1) at 0.1 C after high-rate cycling and remained similar to 88% of the initial reversible capacity.

A New Type of Electrolyte System To Suppress Polysulfide Dissolution for Lithium Sulfur Battery	ACS NANO			English	Article						lithium-sulfur battery; lithium polysulfide; solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI); electrolyte system; battery cycle life	PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; UV/VIS; METAL	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been explored extensively for high-capacity electric-power storage, but their practical application has been prevented by severe issues stemming from the use of a lithium anode and an organic-liquid electrolyte in which Li2Sx intermediates of the cell discharge reaction are soluble and shuttle to the anode. Both problems are addressed using bis(4-nitrophenyl) carbonate as an additive in the organic-liquid electrolyte. The soluble Li2Sx polysulfides react with the additive to create insoluble polysulfides with a lithium byproduct; this byproduct reacts with the Li-metal anode to create an anode passivation layer that is a good Li+ conductor, which allows for safe and rapid plating/stripping of lithium metal with a low impedance.

However, the insulating properties of sulfur and the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) seriously hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this paper, a novel porous organic polymer (HUT3) was prepared based on the polycondensation between melamine and 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate. The micro morphology of HUT3 was improved by in situ growth on different mass fractions of rGO (5%, 10%, 15%), and the obtained HUT3-rGO composites were employed as sulfur carriers in Li-S batteries with promoted the sulfur loading ratio and lithium-ion mobility. Attributed to the synergistic effect of the chemisorption of polar groups and the physical constraints of HUT3 structure, HUT3-rGO/S electrodes exhibits excellent capacity and cyclability performance. For instance, HUT3-10rGO/S electrode exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 950 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and retains a high capacity of 707 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C. This work emphasizes the importance of the rational design of the chemical structure and opens up a simple way for the development of cathode materials suitable for high-performance Li-S batteries.

A reversible capacity of ca. 650 mAh g(-1) is maintained for over 80 cycles for the S/T-PPy composite with 30 wt.% sulfur.

To meet this challenge, a 2D g-C3N4/graphene sheet composite (g-C3N4/GS) was fabricated as an interlayer for a sulfur/carbon (S/KB) cathode. It forms a laminated structure of channels to trap polysulfides by physical and chemical interactions. The thin g-C3N4/GS interlayer significantly suppresses diffusion of the dissolved polysulfide species (Li2Sx; 2<x <= 8) from the cathode to the anode, as proven by using an H-type glass cell divided by a g-C3N4/GS-coated separator. The S/KB cathode with the g-C3N4/GS interlayer (S/KB@C3N4/GS) delivers a discharge capacity of 1191.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C after 100 cycles, an increase of more than 90 % compared with an S/KB cathode alone (625.8 mAh g(-1)). The S/KB@C3N4/GS cathode shows good cycling life, delivering a discharge capacity as high as 612.4 mAh g(-1) for 1 C after 1000 cycles. According to XPS results, the anchoring of the g-C3N4/GS interlayer to Li2Sx can be attributed to a coefficient chemical binding effect of g-C3N4 and graphene on long-chain polysulfides. Generally, the improvement in electrochemical performance originates from a coefficient of the enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient, increased charge transfer, and the weakening of the shuttle effect of the dissolved Li2Sx as a result of the g-C3N4/GS interlayer.

However, the mechanical strength of 3DGA remains an issue for further application. Herein, a strengthened 3DGA (S3DGA) was achieved by soaking in a low concentration ammonia solution at a relative low temperature. Then the S3DGA loaded sulfur (S3DGA-S) was cut into a round piece and directly used as a cathode without additional binders or conductive additives in Li-S batteries. The mechanical strength, microstructure, and electrochemical properties were investigated by compare with a 3DGA prepared without strengthen. The S3DGA-S presented good mechanical strength, excellent capacity retention, and lower electrochemical impedance.

By studying the parameters of the carbonization process of this biomass residue, certain conditions were determined to obtain a high surface area of carbon (967 m(2) g(-1)) and high porosity (0.49 cm(3) g(-1)). This carbon was capable of accommodating up to 60% by weight of sulfur, infiltrated by the disulphide method. The C-S composite released an initial specific capacity of 915 mAh g(-1) in the Li-S cell at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) with a high retention capacity of 760 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles and a coulombic efficiency close to 100%. The good performance of the composite was also observed under higher current rates (up to 1000 mA g(-1)). The overall electrochemical behaviour of this microporous carbon acting as a sulfur host reinforces the possibility of using biomass residues as sustainable sources of materials for energy storage.

However, ASSLSBs suffer from high interfacial impedance and poor kinetics of electrochemical reactions. Herein, we probed the interfacial electron transfer between active sulfur and conducive carbon in a working cell. The co-axial carbon nanotube@sulfur composite with more robust electron contacts enables fast electron transportation and reduced interfacial charge transfer impedance, leading to a high sulfur utilization and excellent electrochemical performance. An initial discharge capacity of 1138.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.21 mA cm(-2) (0.1C) with a capacity retention of 87.7% after 200 cycles is achieved at a sulfur loading of 1.3 mg cm(-2). Moreover, the cathode with superior and uniform electronic contacts delivers better rate capability and a higher discharge specific capacity at a high sulfur loading ranging from 3.8 to 5.9 mg cm(-2). This work verifies the significance of 3D interconnected electronic pathways in the sulfur cathode for high performance ASSLSBs.

However, the insulation of the elemental sulfur and polysulfides dissolution could result in poor cycling performance of Li/S batteries, thus restricting the industrialization process. Here, we prepared sulfur-based composite by thermal treatment. The modified acetylene black (H-AB) was used as a carrier to fix sulfur. The H-AB could interact with polysulfides and reduce the dissolution of polysulfides in the electrolyte. Nonetheless, the conductivity of H-AB relatively reduced. So the conductivity of the sulfur electrode would be improved by the addition of the conductive agent (AB). In this paper, the different content of conductive agent (AB) in the sulfur electrode was studied. The electrochemical tests indicate that the discharge capacity of the sulfur electrode can be increased by increasing the conductive agent (AB) content. The H-AB@S composite electrode with 30 wt.% conductive agent has the best cycle property. The discharge capacity still remains at 563 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, which is 71% retention of the highest discharge capacity.

However, due to poor electronic and ionic conductivity, shuttle effect, lithium dendrites and other defects, it remains a big challenge to achieve large-scale application of lithium-sulfur batteries. Here we report an all-solid-state lithium-sulfur battery based on Li-argyrodite Li6PS5Cl solid-state electrolytes through a slurry-coating method. Li6PS5Cl with a high ionic conductivity of 1.3 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature is used as the solid electrolyte and the ion conductive additive in the electrode. The sulfur-based composite cathode is fabricated through a slurry-coating process by dispersing sulfur, Li6PS5Cl, ethyl cellulose, and carbon black in 1,3-dioxolane (DOL). This method can disperse the Li6PS5Cl around sulfur particles well, and the solvent does not react with any component of composite cathodes during preparation. The battery delivers a high discharge capacity of 962 mA h g(-1) at room temperature for the first cycle at 80 mA g(-1). While the Coulombic eciency is approximately 99.5% during 100 cycles. This work provides a new insight into the combination method between the sulfide-type SSEs and sulfur cathodes, which is critical to the electrochemical performance of all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries.

PSC/sulfur composites (PSC/S, S: ca.59 wt %) were then made and characterized as cathodes in lithium/sulfur batteries. The relationships between the electrochemical performance of PSC/S composites and their pore structure and particle morphology were systematically investigated. PSC/S composite cathodes with large pore volume (>2.81 cm(3)/g) and pore size (>5.10 nm) were found to exhibit superior electrochemical performance, likely due to better mass transport in the cathode. In addition, compared with irregularly shaped carbon/sulfur composite, the spherical shaped PSC/S composite showed better performance due to better electrical contact among the particles.

Nevertheless, the practical applications are heavily hindered by polysulfide shuttle effect, which would cause fast capacity fading. Polysulfide adsorption has been proved to be an effective strategy via chemical bonding or physical constraint. Here, a fresh LixLayTiO3 and acetylene black hybrid coated separator was constructed to suppress the migration of polysulfides and served as an upper current collector to fully utilize the active material. The acetylene black embellished separator and the pristine one were used as reference. Comprehensive and systematic results proved that the hybrid coated separator could not only effectively trap polysulfides, but also promote the conversion of polysulfides, which would improve the rate and cycle performance. The as-prepared sample with 1.0% Li-x- LayTiO3 addition showed the best electrochemical performance with a high capacity of 890 mA h g(-1) at 1600 mAg(-1). An enhanced cycling performance with 716 mA h g(-1) retained after 100 cycles at 800 mA g(-1) was observed, corresponding to a capacity retention of 81.2%. In summary, this study provides a simple, low cost and effective approach to promote the development of lithium sulfur batteries. (C)( 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With a significantly higher theoretical specific energy than conventional lithium-ion batteries, this technology is intensely investigated. However, currently used cathodes have some critical drawbacks which affect the performance of Li-S batteries. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) demonstrates its power for solving some emerging issues in energy-storage systems. The application of alumina (Al2O3) to the cathode surface improves the morphology and/or chemistry, providing a solution for some of the most common issues of Li-S batteries. Herein, the cathode of Li-S batteries is coated with alumina by ALD. In addition, the optimal parameters for ALD application to sulfur-based electrodes are reported. It is demonstrated that alumina deposition results in an improved capacity of the system. The process temperature plays an important role, in particular for few-cycle ALD processes, aiding better cell performance. Higher numbers of ALD cycles, especially at elevated process temperatures, result in considerable sulfur loss, which significantly lowers the cell performance. Cathodes coated with alumina at low process temperatures and with low numbers of ALD cycles are promising alternatives for conventional Li-S cathodes as they increase the capacity of the system considerably.

Herein, to explore a facile integrated approach to tackle both problems as well as guarantee the efficient charge transfer, we used two-dimension hexagonal VS2 flakes as the building blocks to assemble nanotowers on the separators, forming a symmetrical double-side-modified polypropylene separator without blocking the membrane pores. Benefiting from the "sulfiphilic" and "lithiophilic" properties, high interfacial electronic conductivity, and the unique hexagonal tower-form nanostructure, the D-HVS@PP separator not only guarantees the effective suppression of the lithium polysulfide shuttle and the rapid ion/electron transfer but also realizes uniform and stable lithium nucleation and growth during cycling. Hence, just at the expense of an 11% increase in the separator weight (0.14 mg cm(-2)), the D-HVS@PP separator delivers an over 16 times higher initial areal capacity (8.3 mAh cm(-2)) than a conventional PP separator (0.5 mAh cm(-2)) under high sulfur-loading conditions (9.24 mg cm(-2)). Even when used under a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 4 mL g(-1) and a practically relevant N/P ratio of 1.7, the D-HVS@PP separator still enabled stable cycling with a high cell-level gravimetric energy density. The potentials in broader applications (Li-S pouch battery and Li- Li-FePO4 battery) and the promising commercial prospect (large-scale production and recyclability) of the developed separator are also demonstrated.

In the present work, we report a cathode acting simultaneously as a highly efficient LiPSs immobilizer and sulfur host. It is composed of sulfur embedded inside a hollow sphere, the shell of which is made of hollow black TiO2 (b-TiO2) spherical nanoparticles. The particles of the composite are then coated with a polypyrrole (PPy) layer to form the active cathode element (b-TiO2/S@PPy). The particular topology of the b-TiO2 layer provides enough space to alleviate the volume expansion of LiPSs. Equally, the PPy coating layer can not only improve the conductivity of the cathodes, but also restrain the shuttle of LiPSs by chemical adsorption. With the sulfur content of 59.6 wt% corresponding to a sulfur loading of 1.5-1.8 mg cm(-2), the lithium-sulfur batteries with the b-TiO2/S@PPy cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity (1374 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C), a superior cycling stability (910 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1C), and a good rate performance (725 mAh g(-1) at 2C).

Functional separator, which bridges anode, electrolyte and cathode together, has the potential to offer a perfect solution to these concerns. Herein, we develop a functional ammoniated polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber separator (APANF) which can simultaneously inhibit Li dendrite formation and polysulfides shuttling. Branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) are fixed on the electrospun PAN nanofiber mat via a chemical grafting to provide amino groups. Such strongly polar separator can well regulate the uniform Li ions distribution and induce the formation of the Li3N-rich SEI layer, resulting in an interesting 3D spherical and dendrite-free Li deposit pattern. The coulombic efficiency of resulting Li anode can be improved up to 98.8% with a low overpotential of 15 mV. Meanwhile, the separator can also serve as a block for polysulfides shutting due to the strong chemical adsorption capability of PEI, thus facilitating the capacity retention of sulfur cathode. This work provides an easy and scalable alternative to conventional polyolefin separators for solving problems in both anode and cathode of Li-S battery.

Herein, porous g-C3N4 nanotubes (PCNNTs) are synthesized via a self-template method and utilized as an efficient sulfur host material. The one-dimensional PCNNTs have a high specific surface area (143.47 m(2)center dot g(-1)) and an abundance of macro-/mesopores, which could achieve a high sulfur loading rate of 74.7wt%. A Li-S battery bearing the PCNNTs/S composite as a cathode displays a low capacity decay of 0.021% per cycle over 800 cycles at 0.5 C with an initial capacity of 704.8 mAh center dot g(-1). PCNNTs with a tubular structure could alleviate the volume expansion caused by sulfur and lithium sulfide during charge/discharge cycling. High N contents could greatly enhance the adsorption capacity of the carbon nitride for LPSs. These synergistic effects contribute to the excellent cycling stability and rate performance of the PCNNTs/S composite electrode.

Herein, we have designed a multifunctional sulfur host based on yolk-shelled Fe2N@C nanoboxes (Fe2N@C NBs) through a strategy of etching combined with nitridation for high-rate and ultralong Li-S batteries. The highly conductive carbon shell physically confines the active material and provides efficient pathways for fast electron/ion transport. Meanwhile, the polar Fe2N core provides strong chemical bonding and effective catalytic activity for polysulfides, which is proved by density functional theory calculations and electrochemical analysis techniques. Benefiting from these merits, the S/Fe2N@C NBs electrode with a high sulfur content manifests a high specific capacity, superior rate capability, and long-term cycling stability. Specifically, even after 600 cycles at 1 C, a capacity of 881 mAh g(-1) with an average fading rate of only 0.036% can be retained, which is among the best cycling performances reported. The strategy in this study provides an approach to the design and construction of yolk-shelled iron-based compounds@carbon nanoarchitectures as inexpensive and efficient sulfur hosts for realizing practically usable Li-S batteries.

CO2-Oxidized Ti3C2Tx-MXenes Components for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: Suppressing the Shuttle Phenomenon through Physical and Chemical Adsorption	ACS NANO			English	Article						MXenes; CO2 treatment; separator; TiO2; lithium-sulfur batteries	TITANIUM CARBIDE MXENE; POROUS CARBON; PERFORMANCE; SEPARATOR; CATHODE; CO2; COMPOSITES; NANOSHEETS; OXIDATION; MEMBRANE	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are one of the main challenges facing Li-ion technology because the insulating nature of sulfur and the shuttle phenomenon of dissolved lithium polysulfides (LPSs) in liquid electrolytes result in critical problems, including low Coulombic efficiency, loss of active material, and rapid capacity decay. Here, we oxidized delaminated transition metal carbides (MXenes) using CO2 (Oxi-d-MXenes) and used them as both cathode electrode with sulfur and modified separator coated onto the glass fiber without a conductive material and binder to suppress the diffusion of LPSs. Oxi-d-MXenes annealed at 900 degrees C using CO2 gas formed perfectly converted rutile-TiO2 nanocrystalline particles on their two-dimensional sheets. Li-S batteries fabricated with the Oxi-d-MXenes cathode and the Oxi-d-MXenes-modified separator exhibited high Coulombic efficiency (nearly 99%) and retained a capacity of about 900 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at a current density of IC. These results were attributed to the chemical and physical adsorption between the Oxi-d-MXenes and the LPSs.

The severe corrosion of Li metal anode by the dissolved LiPSs bottlenecks the efficient operation of Li-S batteries, however, the anode part has not been received much attention compared to those extensive efforts related to the cathode designs. Herein, we show that the interface between Ti3C2Tx (T=-OH, -F)-based MXene and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is able to guide uniform Li nucleation, promoting highly reversible and dendrite-free Li plating/stripping. Such the Li anode demonstrates excellent cycling stability for more than 1000hours even under ultra-high rate (10mAcm(-2)) and high areal capacity (3mAhcm(-2)). More importantly, the well-designed 2D layered structure by coupling the Ti3C2Tx with a graphene scaffold, is highly efficient to block the shuttled polysulfides and inhibit the corrosion of the lithium metal anode. As a result, the Li-S full battery exhibits a stable cycling stability with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% over 300 cycles. This work suggests the design strategy of Li metal anode especially targeting at the sulfur cathode, and we hope it can provide valuable inspirations for the future design of Li metal anodes for more practical Li-S batteries.

In this work, the hollow structured manganese dioxide modified by polymeric multilayers (PM) is proposed as the sulfur host for lithium sulfur batteries. In the polymeric multilayer-coated S@MnO2 cathode material (S@MnO2@PM), the MnO2 shell shows the capability in trapping the polysulfide intermediates and suppressing the shuttling caused by their dissolution into electrolyte, and the polymeric multilayers improves the Lithorn ion transfer in the composites besides the trapping of polysulfides. The S@MnO2@PM composite exhibits good long-term cyclability due to the synergetic effect of polymeric multilayer and manganese dioxide with hollow porous structure, retaining a discharge capacity of 481 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2 C after 1000 cycles. This demonstration indicates that polymeric multilayers coating on S@MnO2 facilitates the charge transfer and improves the cycling stability of lithium sulfur batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides produced in the battery cycle can result in low sulfur utilization and slow reaction kinetics, which seriously hinders its practical application. Herein, a carrageenan (CG)-acetylene black (AB)-modified separator for long-life Li-S batteries is proposed. The batteries with modified separator exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, fast redox kinetics (733 mAh g(-1) at 6 C), and a low-capacity decay of 0.042% per cycle at 2 C. More importantly, a high reversible capacity of 805 mAh g(-1) can be obtained at a high sulfur loading of 3.2 mg cm(-2). The performance improvement of the separator can be attributed to the outstanding adsorbing polysulfides ability of CG and the better conductivity of AB. Combined with the natural source of CG, simple preparation process, and excellent electrochemical performance, our research results provide a kind of Li-S batteries promising modification idea.

Hierarchical porous carbon modified with ionic surfactants as efficient sulfur hosts for the high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; First-principles calculations; Hierarchical porous carbon; Ionic surfactants; Bio-resource	GRAPHENE OXIDE; FIBER CLOTH; CATHODE; LIFE; IMMOBILIZER; NANOFIBERS; COMPOSITE; NITROGEN; REDOX	Based on first-principles calculations, the hierarchical porous carbon/sulfur composites decorated by ionic surfactants (SDBS, SDS, CTAB) are firstly reported as the cathode materials for advanced lithium sulfur batteries. The morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of the as-synthesized hierarchical porous carbon/sulfur composites are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm, Raman spectra, thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and electrochemical tests. First principles calculations reveal that lithium polysulfides (LiS and Li2S) can bind strongly to the oor N functional groups in the surfactants. Additionally, the hierarchical porous carbon, which derived from a very cheap and abundant cellulose bio-waste lotus seedpod shells, possesses a large specific surface area (2923.04 m(2)/g) and a high pore volume (1.4823 cm(3)/g). Hence, an outstanding initial capacity of 1138 mAh/g at a high discharge rate of 0.5 C with large areal mass loading of 3.2 mg/cm(2) and high sulfur contents of 86.55 wt% is obtained. Even after 100 cycles, the cathode material still represents an excellent cycling stability with reversible capacity of 1116 mAh/g at 0.1C, low capacity decay of 0.16% per cycle and high coulombic efficiency of about 97%.

Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping showed the formation of a porous structure with uniform distribution of sulfur and nitrogen-doped graphene. Electrochemical performance reveals that the resultant S/N-G composite exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1355 mAh g(-1) at the initial cycle, with 823 mAh g(-1) remaining after 80 cycles at 0.1 C. Moreover, a reversible capacity of 475 mAh g(-1) could still be obtained at 2.5 C. Such an electrochemical performance of S/N-G composite is superior to the graphene counterpart. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the introduction of nitrogen-doped graphene with the N functionalization, which provides both a more effective electron conduction path and a stronger physical and chemical confinement setting for elemental sulfur and resident polysulfides.

However, the practical industrialization of Li-S battery is still affected by the low conductivity of sulfur and its discharge product (Li2S2/Li2S), the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (Li2Sn, 4 <= n <= 8) during charging/discharging process and so on. Here, cobalt disulfide/reduced graphene oxide (CoS2/rGO) composites were easily and efficiently prepared through an energy-saving microwave-assisted hydrothermal method and employed as functional interlayer on commercial polypropylene separator to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery. As a physical barrier and second current collector, the porous conductive rGO can relieve the shuttle effect of polysulfides and ensure fast electron/ion transfer. Polar CoS2 nanoparticles uniformly distributed on rGO provide strong chemical adsorption to capture polysulfides. Benefitting from the synergy of physical and chemical constraints on polysulfides, the Li-S battery with CoS2/rGO functional separator exhibits enhanced conversion kinetics and excellent electrochemical performance with a high cycling initial capacity of 1,122.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, good rate capabilities with 583.9 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, and long-term cycle stability (decay rate of 0.08% per cycle at 0.5 C). This work provides an efficient and energy/time-saving microwave hydrothermal method for the synthesis of functional materials in stable Li-S battery.

However, the practical application is limited by the rapid capacity fading over repeated charge/discharge cycles which is largely attributed to the formation and shuttling of soluble polysulfide species. To address these issues, we develop a hierarchical structure composite with triple protection strategy via graphene, organic conductor PEDOT, and nitrogen and phosphorus codoped biological carbon to encapsulate sulfur species (GOC@NPBCS). This unique hierarchical structure can effectively immobilize the sulfur species while at the same time improve the electrical conductivity and ensure efficient lithium ion transport to enable excellent Li-S battery performance. In particular, the biological carbon derived from natural bacteria features inherent nitrogen and phosphorus codoping with a strong absorption to lithium polysulfides, which can greatly suppress the dissolution and shuttling of polysulfides that are responsible for rapid capacity fading. With these synergistic effects, the GOC@NPBCS cathode exhibits exceptionally stable cycling stability (an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.045% per cycle during 1000 cycles at the current rate of 5 C), high specific capacity (1193.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C based on sulfur weight), and excellent rate capability.

However, the severe dissolution and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is still the key issue that seriously impedes the development of practical Li-S batteries. Here, polar Co9S8 inlaid carbon nanoboxes (Co9S8@C NBs) have been investigated as cathode host for high-performance Li-S batteries. In this integrated structure, Co9S8 nanocrystals not only provide strong chemisorptive capability for polar LiPSs, but also act as a catalyst to accelerate polysulfide redox reactions; while carbon nanobox with large inner space can offer enough space to relieve the volume expansion and physically confine LiPSs' dissolution. As a result, the S/Co9S8@C NBs cathode exhibits high specific capacity at 1C and the capacity retention was similar to 83% after 400 cycles, corresponding to an average decay rate of only similar to 0.043% per cycle.

J	Li, J; Xu, YL; Wang, JP				Li, Juan; Xu, Youlong; Wang, Jingping			Preparation and Application of Nanorod FeOOH/CNT@S Composites for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						shuttle effect; electronic conductivity; lithium-sulfur batteries; FeOOH/CNT; polysulfides	POROUS CARBON; CATHODE; SPONGE; ANODE	The shuttle effect from the dissolution of intermediate lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte and the poor conductivity of sublimated sulfur hinder the commercialization of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. A one-step hydrothermal method is used to synthesize a nanorod iron hydroxide/carbon nanotube (FeOOH/CNT) composite. The UV-vis experiment shows that the FeOOH/CNT composite is beneficial to adsorption of the Li2S6 solution, which can be attributed to the strong interaction between the Li2S6 solution and the FeOOH/CNT composite. Meanwhile, the introduction of CNTs facilitates rapid electron transfer, leading to a decreased charge-transfer resistance value of the whole electrode. The FeOOH/CNT@S-M composite was prepared by mixing sulfur particles and the FeOOH/CNT composite with ball milling. Further, the synthesized FeOOH/CNT@S-A provides a strong interaction between the FeOOH/CNT composite and sulfur particles after annealing. The S-O and C-S bonds observed in XPS results further confirmed the strong adsorption ability between the two substances, resulting in a suppressed shuttle effect. Eventually, the FeOOH/CNT@S-A electrode has an initial discharge specific capacity of 1290 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1). After cycling for 200 cycles, the electrode displays a discharge specific capacity of 742 mA h g(-1) (at 1 A g(-1)) with similar to 88.5% capacity retention, revealing its good cycling stability. This work demonstrates the potential application of FeOOH/CNT@S-A composite materials in high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the role of catalysts on catalytic mechanism of distinctive selectivity is still not understood and overlooked. Herein, a dual-functional strategy, composed of Fe3O4 nanoparticles/hierarchical porous carbon (Fe3O4/HPC) cathode and FeP/HPC modified separator, is proposed to improve anchoring and catalyzing of LiPS, ensure uniform Li2S deposition and reduce the dead sulfur. The systematic theoretical calculation reveals that the Fe3O4 has the stronger binding energy with LiPS (Li2S4 and Li2S6) due to the Fe-S bonds and Li-O bonds. The variations in the catalytic performance of Fe3O4 and FeP are due to the shifts of p band center. Especially, Fe3O4 and FeP tend to selectively catalyze the solid-liquid reaction and liquid-liquid-solid conversion, respectively. Thus, the synergistic effects of dual-catalysts in spatial separation help to achieve excellent cycling stability with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.083% over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Even with a high areal sulfur loading of 5.73 mg cm(-2) and a cruel current density of 0.01 C, the cells can still keep a low shuttle factor of 0.08, demonstrating the effective inhibition of shuttle effect. This work offers novel insights for designing a dual-functional structure in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Cation-selective materials such as graphene oxide (GO) and Nafion have demonstrated to serve effectively as electrostatic shields for polysulfide anions, retarding their diffusion to the anode side of the battery. Looking into the future, the introducing of these materials in the configuration/composition of multifunctional/multilayered separator systems will promote the high efficiency cycling of high content sulfur cathodes. Enhanced performance metrics and careful minimisation of the mass/volume of these extra components should result in enhanced volumetric/gravimetric energy densities on a cell level for lithium-sulfur battery.

Nevertheless, Li-S batteries have not come to the market for commercialization which is mainly attributed to the limitations such as the insulating nature of orthorhombic sulfur, undesirable polysulfide crossover between the electrodes, and poor interfacial properties between lithium anode and electrolytes. In order to solve these issues, several attempts have been made by researchers around the world. In the present work, in order to restrict polysulfide crossover and to promote the conductivity of elemental sulfur, Fe3O4-seated rGO-sulfur complex is prepared and used as cathode. The Li-S cell delivers a discharge capacity of 1400 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C-rate on its first cycle and a steady discharge capacity is attained at 0.5 C-rate. In the composite cathode, every element works for a particular reason: the added rGO enhances the conductivity of cathode, while Fe3O4 confines polysulfides appreciably as evidenced by TEM and XPS analyses. The self-discharge of the cell is also reduced. The variations of electrolyte resistance (R-s), interfacial resistance (R-i), and charge transfer resistance (R-ct) for various depth of discharge (DOD) and state of charge (SOC) are systematically analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Here, we propose a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) structured conductive polar Ta-doped TiO2 framework with supported Co active site (CoTa@TiO2) to enhance the conversion kinetics of polysulfides. The 3DOM structure serves as an efficient sulfur host for the active sulfur through abundant pores and adsorption site. At the same time, the macropores can buffer the volume expansion of sulfur and enlarged mass transfer. The strong electrostatic attraction between Ti-O bond and polysulfide also promotes the adsorption of polysulfides. Moreover, the doped-Ta improves the conductivity of TiO2 by narrowing the band gap, whereas the supported Co can accelerate the catalytic transformation. Benefited from advanced structural design and synergistic effect of Co and Ta doped TiO2, the Li-S cell with 3DOM CoTa@TiO2 cathode exhibits an impressive areal capacity of 3.4 mAh cm(-2) under a high sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2). This work provides an alternative strategy for the development of carbon-based cathode materials for Li-S batteries.

One of the bottle necks is the limited power density which most conversion based systems have in common. One of the reasons is the formation of solid, insulating charge and discharge products which passivate active surfaces during operation of the cell. In depth knowledge of the formation and dissolution is needed in order to develop counter-measures overcoming the current limitations. In this article we present a continuum model of Li-S batteries including a detailed description of the formation and dissolution of solid particles based on the classical theory of nucleation and growth. By evolving a particle size distribution of the Li2S and S-8 phase we are able to provide a qualitative description of the resulting particle morphology as well as their effect on active surface areas and transport processes. Results of the simulations are in agreement with experimental data published in the literature. We perform intensive parameter studies which provide guidelines for the development of surface modifications enabling a spatial control of solid discharge product precipitation resulting in improved battery performance.

Herein, polypyrrole (PPy) coated hollow cobalt manganate (CoMn2O4) dodecahedrons were prepared via template method, which combines the advantages of manganese-based metal oxide and conductive polymer effectively. The CoMn2O4 as bimetal oxides can trap the intermediate products and inhibit the dissolution of short chain polysulfides in the organic electrolyte. Moreover, the hollow dodecahedron structure provides enough space to alleviate volume change in the cycle process. Furthermore, the conductive PPy layer can enhance the conductivity of nanocomposite and suppress the shuttle effect in the electrolyte. The initial capacity of CoMn2O4/S@PPy cathode reaches up to 1407 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1). The capacity retained ca.736 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) for 150 cycles and 659 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) when cycled 500 times, respectively, along with the Coulombic efficiency was over 99%. Owing to these outstanding electrochemical performances, the as-prepared nanocomposite is promising to be a superior sulfur host in the field of Li-S batteries.

However, its commercialization is still hampered by the rapid capacity degradation which mainly originates from the polysulfides shuttle between the anode and cathode. In this paper, a functional multiwall carbon nanotube/sulfonated polyaniline (MWCNT/SPANI) modified separator is designed to enhance the electrochemical performance of the Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading. The MWCNT/SPANI-coated separator is highly permselective to Li+ but rejects the transportation of polysulfide anions. Besides, the MWCNT/SPANI coating can also work as an upper current collector and provides channels for electron and ion transport to enhance the sulfur utilization and ensure the reactivation of trapped active materials. With the ion selective MWCNT/SPANI-coated separator, the electrochemical performance of the Li-S batteries based on cathodes with high sulfur loading (5 mg cm(-2)) and high sulfur content (72 wt%) has been significantly improved. It delivers a reversible capacity of 913 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles, much higher than that of the cells with pristine Celgard separator. Hence, the ion selective MWCNT/SPANI modified separator is promising for developing high-performance Li-S batteries employing cathodes with high sulfur loading and high sulfur content.

Unraveling the Li2S Deposition Process on a Polished Graphite Cathode for Enhancing Discharge Capacity of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						Li2S deposition; polished graphite; lithium sulfur batteries; surface coverage; modeling	POLYSULFIDE SOLUBILITY; CARBON NANOFIBERS; S BATTERIES; MECHANISM; SULFIDE; INSIGHT; PRECIPITATION; SPECTROSCOPY; IMPEDANCE; ELECTRODE	Solid deposition accounts for three-quarters of the theoretical capacity in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with liquid electrolyte. Despite extensive research efforts on cathode material synthesis, little knowledge has been gained so far in understanding and controlling the growth of solid discharge product in Li-S batteries. In this work, a polished graphite was used as a cathode to understand the growth mechanism of Li2S. The SEM/EDS analysis of the discharged cathodes indicates that the Li2S precipitate can grow over a micrometer in size and its morphology strongly depends on the depth of discharge (DODs) and discharge rate of the cell. In addition, the morphology evolution and the in situ electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) show that the Li2S follows a dissolution-precipitation mechanism during its deposition on the graphite surface. Finally, a mathematical model based on the multicomponent transport theory is developed and used to describe the nucleation and precipitation phenomena on the 2D surface and the EIS spectra at different DODs. The model confirms that the surface passivation of the cathode plays a major role during the discharge of the battery and offers a simple way to measure experimentally the surface coverage as a function of the DOD in Li-S batteries. This work highlights the importance of deferring cathode surface passivation in Li-S batteries and indicates the potential utilization of nonporous carbons as alternative sulfur hosts.

In order to solve the above problem and promote LSBs commercialization, herein a holistic design strategy on the molybdenum disulfide-coated nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon sphere/sulfur (NMCS@MoS2/S) composite cathode and carbon nanotube/chitosan modified separator (CNT/CH) is proposed. In the holistic design, the NMCS@MoS2 plays a role in the host of sulfur and the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) adsorbent; the CNT/CH modified separator also has an inestimable role in promoting lithium ion transport and chemical adsorption of LiPSs. The results show that the LSBs with the NMCS@MoS2/S-CNT/CH release a high reversible capacity of 827 mAh g(-1) with a high capacity retention of 92.4% at 0.5 C after 200 cycles. The delicate design exhibits apparently excellent electrochemical performance and provides an exciting strategy for solving the shuttle effect of LiPSs and boosting industrialization of LSBs.

To solve this issue, a thin layer (3 mu m) of radially oriented 3D MoS2 nanospheres (3D MoS2) constructed by 2D MoS2 nanosheets is developed as an interlayer coating overlaid on the sulfur cathode, which can simultaneously prevent polysulfide migration and facilitate Li+ diffusion. The trapping and catalytic conversion of polysulfides would benefit from the abundant active edge sites and the large contact surface in the well-preserved MoS2 nanosheets. Meanwhile, fast Li+ diffusion can be realized by the expanded (002) interlayer of the MoS2 nanosheets along with the sufficient electrolyte wettability due to the open 3D structure. Thus, the Li-S batteries with a 3D MoS2 interlayer and the pure sulfur cathode exhibit high specific capacity, excellent cycling stability (62.5% capacity retention with a 0.06% capacity decay per cycle and >99% Coulombic efficiency over 600 cycles), and satisfactory areal capacities of 2.92-3.96 mAh cm(-2) at different currents under increased sulfur loading. Furthermore, it is feasible to incorporate the slurry cast interlayer into the existing electrode fabrication, which sheds light on constructing advanced interlayers for commercially viable Li-S batteries.

The porous architecture and unique physicochemical characteristics of biomass-derived carbon materials makes it possible to improve the battery performance. Here, two types of porous carbon composites (NOSPC-1 and NOSPC-2) with insitu N, S and O tri-doping are obtained from yam via chemical activation. Structural analysis reveals that NOSPC-1 presents a highly graphitized interconnected micro-/mesoporous architecture. As a sulfur host, NOSPC-1-800 with 70% sulfur initiates a high reversible discharge capacity of 1556mAhg(-1) at 0.2C. The cathode further exhibits superior rate performance and long cycle life with 401.2mAhg(-1) reversible capacity and more than 95% coulombic efficiency after 450 cycles at 1C.

It delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1524 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and a discharge capacity of 610 mAh g(-1) at 8 C. The designed Li-S battery exhibited superior long-term stability. After 350 cycles tested at 1 C, it retained a capacity as high as 700 mAh g(-1). It revealed that the N-dopants and decorated CNS nanoparticles in the composite could provide active sites to adsorb soluble poly-sulfides and accelerate the conversion of polysulfides in redox reactions, respectively, thereby suppressing the shutter effect and improving the electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery.

La2O3 nanoplates are anchored tightly in interlaced CNTs framework to form a highly efficient sulfur host. Benefiting from synergistic effects of nonpolar CNTs and polar La2O3 in both enhancing conductivity and capturing polysulfide by physical and chemical adsorptions, the novel S/CNTs/La2O3 composite exhibited superior electrochemical properties in lithium/sulfur battery. The S/CNTs/La2O3 cathode exhibited initial reversible discharge capacity of 1251 mAh g(-1) and maintained 1011 mAh g(-1) capacity after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. The capacity decay rate of S/CNTs/La2O3 cathode was as low as 0.067% per cycle over 300 cycles at 1.0 C, showing good long-cycling stability. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of acid etching temperature on the morphology and pore structure of HNTs was explored and the morphological characteristics and electrochemical performance of composite electrodes formed by HNTs that after treatment with different acid etching temperatures and RGO were compared. The result shows that the cycling stability and the utilization rate of active substances of the Li-S battery were greatly improved because the pore structure and surface polarity functional groups of HNTs and the introduction of RGO provide a conductive network for insulating sulfur particles. The RGO@HNTs treated by acid treatment at 80 degrees C (RGO@HNTs-80/S) composite electrode at 0.1 C has an initial capacity of 1134 mAh g(-1), the discharge capacity after 50 cycles retains 20.1% higher than the normal S electrode and maintains a specific discharge capacity of 556 mAh g(-1) at 1 C. Therefore, RGO and HNTs can effectively improve the initial discharge specific capacity, cycle performance and rate performance of Li-S batteries.

However, the poor electrochemical performance mainly associated with the polysulfides shuttle has greatly hampered their practical application. Herein, a simple acetylene black (AB)-CoS2 coated separator is first designed to suppress the migration of polysulfides. The AB-CoS2 modified separator can not only efficiently capture the polysulfides by forming strong chemical bonding but also guarantee the rapid lithium ions diffusion. Moreover, the AB-CoS2 coating could serve as an upper current collector to accelerate electron transport for reinforcing the utilization of sulfur and ensuring the reactivation of the trapped active material. Consequently, the Li-S cell using AB-CoS2 modified separator shows a long-term cycling stability with an extremely low decay rate (0.09% per cycle) up to 450 cycles at a high rate of 2 C (3350 mA g(-1)). It also exhibits excellent rate capabilities, which maintains a capacity of 475 mAh g(-1) even at 4.0 C rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

How-ever, the vast majority of these host materials are not yet used for the construction of high-energy-density batteries, due to the lack of effective ways to fabricate high-performance cathodes under high-sulfur-loading conditions. Here we present a convenient and universal strategy toward traditional slurry-coating procedure for fabricating high-sulfur-loading cathodes. Through rational designing conductive additives and polymer binders, their derived water-based conductive inks are developed to improve the mechanical and conductive properties of the slurry-coating cathodes and to reduce the polysulfide shuttling of the slurry-coating cathodes with high sulfur content (64-72 wt%) and high sulfur loading ( > 5 mg cm(-2)). This strategy not only enables the Super-P/S cathodes to deliver the enhanced structure parameters and electrochemical performance for constructing a 2.5 Ah pouch cell with a specific energy of 323 Wh kg(-1), but also is suitable for diverse lab-developed sulfur hosts, thus opening a promising avenue for high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

J	Yao, YJ; Lu, Q; Gao, H; Wang, XH; Wang, FS				Yao, Yu-jie; Lu, Qi; Gao, Hong; Wang, Xian-hong; Wang, Fo-song			Studies on the Influence of Pyrene on the Low Temperature Performance of Polyaniline Containing Lithium-sulfur Battery	ACTA POLYMERICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Polyaniline; Pyrene; Lithium-sulfur battery; Low temperature performance; Redox mediator	ELECTRODE MATERIALS; CATHODE MATERIAL; GRAPHENE; NANOFIBERS; INTERFACE; COMPOSITE; LI2S	Conductive polyaniline is an important material to improve the capacity and cycle stability of Lithium-sulfur battery, but lithium-sulfur cathode with conductive polyaniline still faces poor capacity retention and cycle stability at temperature below 0 degrees C due to slow equilibration of sulfur or polysulfides. A novel concept using redox mediator to accelerate electrochemical reaction at low temperature was proposed. By adding a redox mediator with its redox potential below S and between Li and S, the electrochemical reaction is accelerated and the low temperature performance of Li-S battery is therefore improved. More specifically, when pyrene is used as the redox mediar (RM), it can be oxidized to RM+ at the cathode surface by sulfur or polysulfides, then RM+ attains electron from cell system regenerating RM. The mediator acts as an electron transfer agent permitting efficient reduction of sulfur or polysulfides. Pyrene is identified from cyclic voltammogram (CV) test as electrochemical active substance around the high-plateau in discharge process, which meets the requirement of redox mediator in Li-S battery at low temperature. When pyrene was dissolved in electrolyte, it may act as an effective electron transfer agent to increSase the electron transfer rate, permitting efficient reduction of sulfur to polysulfides Li2SX (4 <= X <= 8), thereby accelerating the equilibration process, and finally enhanced the low temperature performance of Li-S battery. To analyze the influence of pyrene on the composition of reduction products of sulfur, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to test the cathode material after discharging to 2.2 V at the 10th cycle. XPS experiments confirm that the addition of pyrene may accelerate the polysulfides equilibration rate and prolong the first plateau. When ultrathin sulfur-wrapped PANI nanocomposite (S-PANI) is used as cathode material, taking the capacity of 25 degrees C as reference, the addition of 0.1 mol/L pyrene into electrolyte could raise the 50th capacity retention rate from 68.9% to 84.6% at 0 degrees C, i.e. by 22.8%. This capacity retention rate is increased by 25.2% from 56.0% to 70.1% at -15 degrees C.

Our results show that Prussian blue improves the electrochemical reaction kinetics during discharge/charge processes. More importantly, the cathode with Prussian blue exhibits better cycling stability and higher discharge capacity retention (722 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) after 100 cycles) than the one without Prussian blue (151 mAh g-1). These improvements of electrochemical performances are ascribed to the fact that Prussian blue is very effective in suppressing the dissolution of polysulfides into liquid electrolyte by chemical adsorption.

The electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) based on CNTs/MOFs-C/Al-2(OH)(2.76)F-3.24/S cathode can be superior to reported LSBs performance, showing a specific capacity of 889 mA h g(-1) at 300th cycle at current density of 500 mA g(-1). Notably, a longest cycling life span of 2000 cycles at high current density of 2 A g(-1) with a specific capacity of 719 mA h g(-1) maintained and coulombic efficiency of approximately 100% based on CNTs/MOFs-C/Al-2(OH)(2.76)F-3.24/S cathode is reported. Coupling of CNTs with MOFs-C to form 3D interconnected network can provide an efficient pathway for fast ion delivery and electron transport, effectively enhances charge transfer kinetics. The in-situ formation of Al-2(OH)(2.76)F-3.24 polar nanoparticles further immobilize sulfur species by strong chemical interactions between the intermediate polysulfides and hydroxyl functional groups, Al-F polar bonds. The rational design route for hydroxyhalide nanoparticle anchored MOFs-derived porous carbon sponges interlinked by CNTs is novel and inspiring, opening up a new gate for sulfur hosts in LSBs.

Furthermore, the cathode design and discharge parameters also impact the mesostructural evolutions of carbon/sulfur composites. In order to compare and study these mesostructural evolutions, we have developed a novel three dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model based on an algorithm called Variable Step Size Method (VSSM). Our model describes mechanisms such as dissolution of solid sulfur, reactions and diffusions of different polysulfides and electrodeposition of Li2S. The initial carbon/sulfur mesostructure used in our model is created based on its desired structural and geometric properties using an in silico method. In this paper, we present the theoretical development of our kMC model and demonstrate its capabilities using discharge simulations of a model carbon/sulfur mesostructure under two different rates (C-rates) namely C/2 and 2C. Furthermore, we also present the impact of initial S-8(S) loading on the 2C discharge simulation.

Herein, 3D hierarchical structured CoMn2O4 hollow microspheres assembled by primary nanocrystalline, as carbon-free sulfur hosts, were prepared and employed to fabricate the CoMn2O4-S composite. The unique hollow architectures not only could offer enough space for accommodating sulfur and relieving volume expansion of sulfur during cycles, but also provide favorable ion transport and sufficient active sites for catalytic conversion of polysulfides. The CoMn2O4 possesses high electronic conductivity and strong polar feature, allowing a high discharge capacity and good cycle stability by restraining shuttle effect of polysulfides. More importantly, CoMn2O4-S composite shows a high tap density of 1.73 g cm(-3), due to employment of the heavy CoMn2O4 as sulfur host, thus the electrode could deliver a high volumetric capacity of 907.1 mAh cm(-3) even at 1600 mA g(-1).

In this study, kombucha (that was derived from symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) carbon (KC) and graphene oxide (GO) were used as a carbon host matrix. These rational-designed S/PAN/KC/GO hybrid composites greatly suppress the diffusion of polysulfides by providing strong physical and chemical adsorption. The cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1652 mAh center dot g-1 at a 0.1 C rate and a 100(th) cycle capacity of 1193 mAh center dot g-1. The nano sheets with embedded hierarchical pores create a conductive network that provide effective electron transfer and fast electrochemical kinetics. Further, the nitrogen component of PAN can raise the affinity/interaction of the carbon host with lithium polysulfides, supporting the cyclic performance. The results exploit the cumulative contribution of both the conductive carbon matrix and PAN in the enhanced performance of the positive electrode.

To date, various carbon hosts have been utilized to confine sulfur for improving Li-S battery performance. However, the adopted sulfur storage techniques are post-carbon-synthesis involving complex processes. It remains a great challenge to determine the ideal configuration of carbon-sulfur composites with uniform dispersion and high sulfur loading. Herein, we report a novel synthesis of graphene-sulfur composites by electrolytic exfoliation of graphite coupled with in situ sulfur electrodeposition. The sample delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1080 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and retains above 900 mA h g(-1) over 60 cycles. This strategy via electrochemical exfoliation/deposition synchronous reactions can provide strong sulfur chemical interactions with the graphene host, achieving advanced cathode materials for Li-S batteries.

To address these problems, herein, a novel multifunctional sulfur cathode design strategy of coating microsporous covalent organic framework (COF) onto metal organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon/transition metal composite is developed. This strategy is proofed by coating a TpPa-1 COFs layer on the UIO-66-NH2-derived N-doped Co/Zr-NC, forming core-shell structured Co/Zr-NC@TpPa composite. The Co/Zr-NC core consists of Co nanoparticles and ZrO2 that offers effective sulfur trapping and catalysis effect for sulfur redox reaction, whereas the microsporous COF shell with polar functional groups further reduces the shuttling of LiPS. The S/Co/Zr-NC@TpPa cathode achieves an initial capacity of 792 mAh g(-l) at 1 C with 76.4% capacity retention after 500 cycles. More importantly, under the high sulfur loading of 5.10 mg cm(-2), it has a high specific surface area capacity of 4.15 mAh cm(-2) at 0.2 C. This study provides a promising alternative design strategy for the development of efficient sulfur host in Li-S batteries.

These two challenges can be overcome by using solid-state electrolytes. But poor ionic and electronic conductivity due to solid/solid contact between the electrode and the electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs). Here, we have synthesized Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12(LLZO) conductive ceramics with high ionic conductivity. LLZO is used as the lithium-ion conductor and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNt) are used as the electronic conductor to form S/MWCNt/LLZO by the thermal diffusion method, resulting in an e(-)/S/Li+ conductive network. The prepared S/MWCNt/LLZO composite material, composite solid electrolyte, and lithium metal are assembled into ASSLSBs. After 50 cycles, the high capacity of 825 mAh.g(-1) is maintained with 72.62% capacity retention at 0.2C and 45 degrees C. The higher capacity indicates the success of forming a conductive network that can improve the electrochemical performance of ASSLSBs. At 0.2C, the capacity of the S/MWCNt/LLZO composite cathode remains at 873 mAh.g(-1) after 60 cycles when the operating temperature is increased to 60 degrees C, indicating good cycle performance.

However, there are some critical challenges to be overcome such as low electronic conductivity and capacity fading caused by shuttle effect. Many attempts have been conducted to improve the electrochemical performance by designing effective sulfur hosts. In this paper, we synthesize a concrete-like sulfur/carbon cathode with high sulfur content (84%) by using 3D macroporous hosts with high pore volume. Sophisticated strategies of using polarized carbon framework and polymer coating are applied to synergistically control the dissolution of polysulfides so that the capacity retention and high rate performance can be remarkably enhanced. As a result, the composite exhibits a specific discharge capacity of 820 mAh g(-1) at a discharge current of 800 mA g(-1) (approximate to 0.5 C) after 100 cycles, calculated on the integrated mass of composite, which is superior to most report results.

To address the issues, herein, a multifunctional host is developed by the combination of nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped carbon fiber (NPCF) and CoS2 towards boost the soluble polysulfides adsorption and transformation. Benefiting from the NPCF originated from biomass cattail fibers, a high conductive network is provided, and shuttle effect is reduced due to the strong chemical interaction between abundant heteroatom polar sites and lithium polysulfides. Moreover, the electrocatalytic CoS2 on the carbon skeleton facilitate lithium polysulfides conversion and lithium sulfide deposition based on the density functional theory calculations and experiments. The efficient lithium polysulfides entrapment and subsequent electrocatalytic conversion improve dynamic stability during cycling, especially for rate capability. With these advantageous features, the electrode with NPCF/CoS2 host can deliver a good rate capability (903 and 782 mAh g (1) at 1C and 2C, respectively) and stable cycling performance with an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.014% per cycle at 1C. Notably, the cell can achieve a high areal capacity of 4.96 mA h cm (2) under an elevated sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm(2). Overall, the improvement on the electrochemical performance ascertains the validity of the design strategy based on synergy engineering, which is a highly suitable approach for energy storage and conversion application.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate the microstructures and morphology of the as-prepared samples. It is demonstrated that the sulfur can be evenly impregnated into the MWCNT-PANI-G composite with strong chemical bonding. The resultant S@ MWCNT-PANI-G composite with a sulfur content of 68 wt% shows excellent electrochemical performance as cathode for Li-S batteries. It delivers a high initial discharge capacity up to 1290 mA h g(-1), good capacity retention of 784 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles of charge/discharge at the current density of 330 mA g(-1), and good rate capability of 663 mA h g(-1) and 548 mA h g(-1) at 1.65 and 3.3 A g(-1), respectively. The remarkable electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to the unique architecture of MWCNT-PANI-G with an enhanced electronic and ionic conductivity. Furthermore, this special architecture can provide strong physical and chemical confinement to the active materials and the soluble lithium polysulphides. Therefore, our study demonstrates a facile and low-cost approach to fabricate cathode materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, amongst the issues they have, the low electron conductivity of sulfur and its dissolution represent the biggest challenge limiting its practical applications. This contributes to the low utilization of the active sulfur at the cathode-a phenomenon known as the "shuttling effect." To overcome these limitations, some strategies such as physical confinement (sulfur-carbon composite), chemical adsorption (N and/or S doping) electrolyte design, and separator design have already been proposed. Calcium citrate is the most attractive carbon source because no activation process is necessary and the fabrication process is very simple. In this experiment, we synthesized calcium citrate and sulfur (S) to conduct a charging-discharging test and compared them by adding thiourea (TU) as well as S in the carbonized calcium citrate (CaC). This effective and simple technique for material production can accommodate the charge/discharge reactions and preserve the structure over long cycles. A CaC/TU-S composite is acceptable for an initial discharge capacity of 1051.6 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles at 1 C. The results show that the CaC-S and CaC/TU-S composites have a good, stable specific capacity.

Although much research is conducted on complex sulfur/carbon composites and architectures, it is difficult to compare the performance of the cathodes to one another. Factors, such as different electrolyte composition and cell components strongly affect the cyclability of the battery. Here, we show the importance of optimizing "standard" conditions to allow for fair performance comparison of different carbon blacks. Our optimal electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio is 11 mu L mg(sulfur)(-1) and high concentrations of LiNO3 (>0.6 M) are needed because nitrate is consumed continuously during cycling. Utilizing these standard conditions, we tested the cycling behavior of four types of cathodes with individual carbon blacks having different specific surface areas, namely Printex-A, Super C65, Printex XE-2 and Ketjenblack EC-600JD. Both the specific capacity and polysulfide adsorption capability clearly correlate with the surface area of the carbon being used. High specific capacities (>1000 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) at C/5) are achieved with high surface area carbons. We also demonstrate that a simple cathode using Ketjenblack EC-600JD as the conductive matrix material can well compete with those having complex architectures or additives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The catalyst of mesoporous Ti4O7 nanosheets with O-Ti-O units synthesized at low temperature shows both excellent conductivity and high surface area. The modified separator can serve as a diffusion barrier of Li-PSs and catalyst for converting soluble low-chain sulfides into insoluble ones and then remarkably enhance the sulfur utilization and electrochemical performance of the LSB. This work provides a feasible avenue in both design and synthesis of mesoporous catalyst materials for suppressing the shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Here, a flame-retardant polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper is reported as a multifunctional interlayer in Li-S batteries. During the discharge/charge process, once the LiPS are generated, the as-obtained flame-retardant interlayer traps them immediately through the nucleophilic substitution reaction between PPZ and LiPS, effectively inhibiting the shuttling effect of LiPS to enhance the cycle stability of Li-S batteries. Meanwhile, this strong chemical interaction increases the diffusion coefficient for lithium ions, accelerating the lithiation reaction with complete inversion. Moreover, the as-obtained interlayer can be used as a fresh 3D current collector to establish a flame-retardant "vice-electrode," which can trap dissolved sulfur and absorb a large amount of electrolyte, prominently bringing down the flammability of the sulfur cathode and electrolyte to improve the safety of Li-S batteries. This work provides a viable strategy for using PPZ-based materials as strong chemical scavengers for LiPS and a flame-retardant interlayer toward next-generation Li-S batteries with enhanced safety and electrochemical performance.

Here, S, N-codoped carbon capsules (SNCCs) with microporous walls, prepared by a self-assembly process, are used as the sulfur host material in Li-S batteries. The SNCCs provide plenty of micron-sized cavities to accommodate a high S loading, which are sealed by thick walls with microsized entrance to efficently suppress the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides. As the cathode in Li-S battery, the SNCCs/sulfur composite with a sulfur mass loading of 70 wt% exhibits a high average reversible capacity of 1220 and 1116 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C and 1C, respectively, superior rate performance (905 and 605 mAh g(-1) at 5C and 10C, respectively) and excellent cycling stability (capacity fading rate of 0.03% per cycle in 500 cycles). Even at a high sulfur areal loading of 7.3 mg/cm(2), the SNCCs/0.7S electrode still deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 838 mAh g(-1) and keeps at 730 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, corresponding to an extraordinary capacity retention of 87.1%, showing an excellent cyclic stability. The outstanding electrochemical performance is associated with the unique capsule structure with abundant volume, microsized entrance and high conductivity. Our results provides a new strategy to prepare highly stable sulfur-carbon composites for the application in Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

However, the practical application of the batteries is being hindered by their poor cycling stability and low Coulombic efficiency, which is mainly attributed by the dissolution of polysulfides and low electronic conductivity of sulfur. Herein, a novel cathode host was designed by mixing the nanoflower-like MnO2 with KB powder loaded on the commercial carbon paper, delivering excellent electrochemical performance even at a high sulfur mass loading of 2.1 mg/cm(2). The nanoflower-like MnO2 obtained from the typical hydrothermal method provides abundant active sites for adsorbing polysulfides chemically. The combination between this chemical capture effect and physical constraint introduced by the pores of nanoflower-like MnO2 and KB powder suppresses the dissolution of lithium polysulfides out of cathode region. Consequently, the modified MnO2-KB@carbon paper-Li2S6 cathode exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 776.4 mAh/g at 0.5 C and retain 814.3 mAh/g after 100 cycles with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. Remarkably, self-discharge rate has been restrained to a very level of 4.7% after 48 h resting, indicating the potential of the nanoflower-like MnO2-KB@carbon paper-Li2S6 cathode for improved preserving ability of lithium sulfur battery.

At the same time, sulfur is earth-abundant, economical and non-poisonous. Nevertheless, the poor electrochemical performance restricts its commercial application, including the inferior cycling stability caused by the significant dissolution of lithium polysulfides and the low specific capacity because of the poor electrical conductivity of sulfur. In this work, we adopt a simple and amicable process to prepare sulfur/alumina/polypyrrole (S/Al2O3/PPy) ternary hybrid material to overcome these defects. In this strategy, each composition of the ternary hybrid material plays an essential role in cathode: alumina and PPy can provide strong adsorption for the dissolved intermediate polysulfides. Meanwhile, PPy also works as a conductive and flexible additive to expedite electron transport, and is coated on the surface of the as-prepared S-Al2O3 composite by in situ chemical polymerization. The sulfur is encapsulated uniformly and perfectively by the two components, which is confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscope. The ternary hybrid material manifests good electrochemical performance as expected, and displays high initial discharge capacity of 1088 mA h g(-1) and a discharge capacity of 730 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). Besides, S/Al2O3/PPy also shows good rate capability. The synergy between alumina and PPy is the decisive factor, which gives rise to good electrochemical performance of cathode for high-performance LSBs. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The most promising approach to mitigate these challenges lies in the fabrication of a sulfur nanocomposite electrode consisting of a homogeneous distribution of nanosized active material, solid electrolyte, and carbon. Here, we reported a novel bottom-up method to synthesize such a nanocomposite by dissolving Li2S as the active material, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the carbon precursor, and Li6PS5Cl as the solid electrolyte in ethanol, followed by a coprecipitation and high-temperature carbonization process. Li2S active material and Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte with a particle size of similar to 4 nm were uniformly confined in a nanoscale carbon matrix. The homogeneous nanocomposite electrode consisting of different nanoparticles with distinct properties of lithium storage capability, mechanical reinforcement, and ionic and electronic conductivities enabled a mechanical robust and mixed conductive (ionic and electronic conductive) sulfur electrode for ASSLSB. A large reversible capacity of 830 mAh/g (71% utilization of Li2S) at SO mA/g for 60 cycles with a high rate performance was achieved at room temperature even at a high loading of Li2S (similar to 3.6 mg/cm(2)). This work provides a new strategy to design a mechanically robust, mixed conductive nanocomposite electrode for high-performance all-solid-state lithium sulfur batteries.

However, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides and shuttle effects lead to a low coulombic efficiency and cycle performance of Li-S batteries. Therefore, designing electrode materials that can suppress the shuttle effect and adsorb polysulfides is of great significance. In this work, a Co and N-codoped carbon composite via heating a type of Co-etched zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), nanocube precursor, in inert gas is reported as a cathode sulfur carrier material for Li-S batteries. The experimental results show that high-temperature carbonization results in mesoporous structures inside the material which not only provide ion channels for the reaction but also improve the adsorption capacity of polysulfides. Furthermore, the exposed metal Co sites and N atoms can also inhibit the shuttle effect. When the annealing temperature is 600 degrees C, the sulfur composite exhibits a good cycling stability and rate performance. The cathode showed an improved initial specific capability of 1042 and still maintained 477 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 1 C (1 C = 1672 mA g(-1)). Furthermore, at 5 C, a stable specific discharge capacity of 608 mAh g(-1) was obtained.

The as-prepared KB-MnO composite were coated on one side of the commercial separators for the improvement of electrochemical performances of Lithium-Sulfur battery. For comparison, conventional separator coated by KB and conventional separator without coating was used in reference Lithium-Sulfur batteries. Electrochemical tests suggested that KB-MnO coated separator could act as the upper current collector and the barrier of lithium polisulfides which consequently achieved higher charge/discharge capacity and more stable cycling stability. Furthermore, TEM elemental map demonstrated that KB-MnO composite was more favorable for the adsorption of lithium polysulfides than KB, therefore the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries can be dramatically enhanced.

However, in the case of actual lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries under practical working conditions, one long-term obstacle still exists, which is mainly due to the difficulties in massive synthesis of such nanomaterials with low cost and ease of control on the nanostructure. Herein, we develop a facile synthesis of carbon coated Ti4O7 hollow nanoparticles (Ti4O7) using spherical polymer electrolyte brush as soft template, which is scalable via utilizing a minipilot reactor. The C Ti4O7 hollow nanoparticles provide strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides through the large polar surface and additional physical confinement by rich micro- & mesopores and have successfully been employed as an efficient sulfur host for multilayer pouch cells. Besides, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur and lithium sulfide redox mechanism can be improved by the highly conductive Ti4O7 via catalyzation of the conversion of polysulfides. Consequently, the C-Ti4O7 based pouch cell endows a high discharge capacity of 1003 mAhg(-1) at 0.05 C, a high-capacity retention of 83.7% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, and a high Coulombic efficiency of 97.5% at the 100th cycle. This work proposes an effective approach to transfer the synthesis of hollow Ti4O7 nanoparticles from lab- to large-scale production, paving the way to explore a wide range of advanced nanomaterials for multilayer Li-S pouch cells.

But a limitation of this technology is the rapid capacity fading resulting from the generation of long-chain lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx), a phenomenon called shuttle effect and the insulating nature of sulfur. To this extent, 2D graphene and its derivatives have been widely investigated to overcome Li-S batteries' drawbacks owing to their outstanding properties. However, the restacking of graphene makes it impossible to obtain the benefits of 2D graphene fully. Thus, the integration of 2D graphene with other 2D materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), suggests a rational option to avoid this problem. In this work, we found that the addition of h-BN to reduced graphene oxide (RGO) resulted in a 2.5 times increase in the electrochemical performance of graphene-based Li-S batteries. Likewise, RGO/h-BN/S composites also showed stable performance at elevated temperatures of similar to 100 degrees C.

An in-plane heterostructure of graphene and titanium carbide for efficient polysulfide confinement	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						In-plane heterostructures; Titanium carbide; Graphene template; Lithium sulfur batteries	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; LI-S BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN; CATHODE; INTERLAYER; DIFFUSION; OXIDATION; FRAMEWORK; MEMBRANE	Lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling is one of the main obstacles hindering the practical use of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Constructing an interlayer composed of carbon or noncarbon materials on separator is a promising way to restrain the LiPS shuttling, but such a layer always hinders the Li ion diffusion and is hard to realize the reuse of the captured LiPSs. In this study, an in-plane heterostructure constructed by graphene and titanium carbide (TiC) was prepared by directly using graphene as a template and the carbon source to react with TiCl4 under thermal treatment. In this process, graphene was partially transformed into TiC forming such a heterostructure, which is benefit to reducing the Li ion and electron diffusion barrier. Moreover, the TiC has strong affinity towards LiPSs and high conductivity. Thus, the in-plane heterostructures filtered on a separator as a coating layer effectively blocks the shuttle of LiPSs and greatly improves the sulfur utilization and cycling performance, indicating a promising way to promote the practical applications of high performance Li-S batteries.

Porous graphene fabricated by chemical activation and liquid etching has a high surface area but very limited volume of electrochemically accessible mesopores. Herein, an effective strategy of in situ formation of hierarchically mesoporous oxide templates with small pores induced by Kirkendall diffusion and large pores attributed to evaporation of deliberately introduced volatile metal is proposed for chemical vapor deposition assembly of porous graphene frameworks (PGFs). The PGFs inherit the hierarchical mesoporous structure of the templates. A high SSA of 1448 m(2) g(-1), 91.6% of which is contributed by mesopores, and a mesopore volume of 2.40 cm(3) g(-1) are attained for PGFs serving as reservoirs of ions or active materials in electrochemical energy storage applications. When the PGFs are applied in lithium-sulfur batteries, a very high sulfur utilization of 71% and a very low fading rate of approximate to 0.04% per cycle after the second cycle are achieved at a current rate of 1.0 C. This work provides a general strategy for the rational construction of mesoporous structures induced by a volatile metal, with a view toward the design of hierarchical nanomaterials for advanced energy storage.

However, due to restrictions on the low conductivity of sulfur and soluble polysulfides during discharge, electrochemical performance of the batteries is deteriorated. Heteroatom doped carbon as an effective strategy can improve the poor electrochemical performance caused by polysulfide shuttle. Hence, the nitrogen and oxygen dual-doped tube-like porous biomass-derived carbon from the fluffy catkins is successfully fabricated for the LiSBs. After carbonization and activation, the tube-like and unique mesoporous structure are obtained and maintained, and a high sulfur content of 82.5 wt% is achieved in tube-like activated carbon material/sulfur composites (TACM/S). The N, O dual-doping introduces more active sites and strong chemical adsorption to anchor the polysulfides, therefore remarkably ameliorating the intractable polysulfide shuttle effect and enhancing the utilization of sulfur. The electrochemical results show that the LiSBs with the TACM/S cathode exhibit high initial discharge capacities as high as 1041.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, and outstanding capacity retention of about 77.5% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.043% per cycle.

However, the Li-S battery suffers from shuttle effect and Li dendrites growth due to the solubility of polysulfides in the electrolyte system and the inhomogeneous deposition of Li, resulting in short cycling life span, which is the major obstacle in its practical application. Herein, we report an additive, hexadecyltrioctylammonium iodide (HTOA-I), in the conventional electrolyte system, which shows trifunctional effect on extending Li-S battery cycle life. It can not only help us to form a protective solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of Li anode so as to reduce the contact of polysulfides with Li but also hinder the shuttling of polysulfides to the Li anode due to the strong combination of large-sized HTOA(+) with polysulfide anions (S-n(2-)), which retard the migration of S-n(2-) and cause homogeneous Li deposition owing to the large size and stronger trend of HTOA(+) to be absorbed on Li anode as well. A new method of phosphorescence analysis for direct observation of polysulfides shuttling has been put forward for the first time, which can be further developed in future studies. The cell with the HTOA-I-added electrolyte system shows high cycling stability, retaining 83.4% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles at 1 A g(-1) and achieving 689 mAh g(-1) even after 1000 cycles. This cost-effective and facile approach will not increase the complexity of the battery manufacturing process. Compared to other electrolyte additives, the additive in our work, HTOA-I, has better positive effects on extending cycle life.

Currently, the composites with covalent triazine frameworks (M-CTFs) modified by metals in the fourth period and graphene (M-CTF/G, M = Li, Ti similar to Zn) were designed as host cathodes and are expected to inhibit the shuttling effect through the modification by the polar metal. Using density functional theory, it was demonstrated that M-CTF/G displayed synergistic adsorption performance of Li2S4 with unsaturated metal-N3 coordinated groups as active sites in the M-CTF. In addition, three solvents with different dielectric constants and polarity, namely, dioxolane, dimethoxyethane dimethyl, and tetramethylurea, were used to investigate the solvent effect, and the effective adsorption energy range of Li2S4 on M-CTF/G was evaluated in the presence of solvents. The theoretical results obtained in this work provide guidance in the design of the cathode and understanding of solvent effects in lithium sulfur batteries.

Herein, we construct a unique hollow-structured Co0.85Se/C as a separator modifier (CSPP) to effectively suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect. The Co0.85Se/C demonstrates strong anchoring with polysulfide species and smooth bidirectional electrocatalysis. The unique mesoporous hollow architecture affords sufficient catalytic sites and Li+ diffusion channels for promoting the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from the merits, the CSPP-cell could yield a superior electrochemical utilization of active sulfur, excellent rate capability (679 mAh g(-1) at 5 C), and stable cycling performance with an ultralow fading rate of 0.056 % per cycle over 500 cycles. The work highlights great promise of developing cobalt-based materials as kinetic regulators for highly stable lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we report a synergistic engineering layer composed of acorn shell porous carbon/Sn4P3 nanodots electrocatalyst (AS PC-Sn4P3). The synergistic engineering layer can not only serve as a conductive interface but also provide a dual-adsorption barrier to retain active material and inhibit the LiPSs migrating. More importantly, electrocatalytic Sn4P3 nanodots supported on acorn shell porous carbon (AS PC) within synergistic engineering layer effectively promote lithium ion diffusion, LiPSs conversion, Li2S2/Li2S deposition, and accelerate the electrochemical redox reaction and therefore curb the soluble LiPSs shutting behavior. As a result, enhanced Li-S battery performance is achieved with synergistic engineering layer, e.g., excellent cycling stability over 900 cycles at 1.0C with a low capacity decay of 0.046% per cycle, a good rate performance, and a high areal capacity of 8.7 mAh cm(-2) under lean electrolyte conditions.

Ultrahigh rate and high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries with resorcinol-formaldehyde xerogel derived highly porous carbon matrix as sulfur cathode host	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Highly porous carbon; RF xerogel; N-doping; Cathode composite; Lithium-sulfur battery	MOLECULAR-ORBITAL METHODS; N-DOPED CARBON; LONG CYCLE-LIFE; ANODE MATERIAL; BASIS-SETS; NITROGEN; GRAPHENE; PROGRESS; CAPACITY; SHUTTLE	Lithium-Sulfur Battery (LSB) is looked upon as a promising energy storage device to be used in high end applications due to their high energy metrics. However, the successful commercialization of LSBs is hauled by limitations of low sulfur utilization, insulating sulfur, and poor cyclic stability. Restricting polysulfide shuttling and improving electrochemical kinetics are important in developing high-performance LSBs. Here, we have resolved these critical problems associated with LSBs even at extreme operating current conditions using highly porous N-doped resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) carbon xerogel as sulfur host. We developed a RF xerogel-derived highly porous N-doped carbon matrix by two-step carbonization-activation strategy for anchoring polysulfides and accelerating their redox transformation simultaneously. The high amount of N-doping (10%) and graphitic domains, amid the porous amorphous carbon, possess active sites to entrap polysulfides. Besides, they provide pathways for high electron transfer for their electro-catalysis. First principle calculations also establish that the enhanced performance is attributed to high pyrrolic nitrogen content in the porous carbon structure. As a result, the A-N-RFC/S cathode composite exhibits excellent cycling stability, maintaining a specific capacity of 631 mAh g(-1) at 4 C even after 500 cycles, corresponding to an extremely low capacity decay of 0.0017% per cycle with coulombic efficiency of more than 95%. Additionally, the composite material displays astonishing rate performance exhibiting an outstanding discharge capacity of 359 mAh g(-1) even at an ultra-high current rate 20 C. The synthesized material overcomes the two key parameters, cyclic stability and rate performance required for commercial LSBs by suppressing the detrimental polysulfide shuttling.

The application of accelerating conversion through bidirectional catalysts to address the adverse effects of the shuttle effect on batteries has caused extensive concern. Here, bimetallic nickel-cobalt phosphide-based yolk-shell spheres loaded on reduced graphene oxide (NiCo2PX/rGO) are designed as bidirectional catalysts, which integrates the merits of NiCo2PX and rGO to facilitate the redox reaction kinetics, resulting in rapid deposition during discharging and fast decomposition during charging of the end products (Li2S). The porous yolk-shell structure synthesized by the anion exchange method exposes more catalytic sites for massive host-guest interaction. Based on its unique function and structure, the sulfur cathode with NiCo2PX/rGO delivers a high capacity of 1238.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintains a stable discharge capacity of 561.1 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at 1 C. This study explores the bidirectional catalysis of polysulfides with bimetallic phosphide materials, which provides a new choice for next-generation lithium-sulfur batteries.

But the shuttling effect of polysulfides caused by charge-discharge process results in low sulfur utilization and poor reversibility. Here, we demonstrate a good approach to improve the utility of sulfur and cycle life by synthesizing carbon nanofibers decorated with MoO2 nanoparticles (MoO2-CNFs membrane), which plays a role of multiinterlayer inserting between the separator and the cathode for Li-S battery. The S/MoO2-CNFs/Li battery showed a discharge capacity of 6.93 mAh cm(-2) (1366 mAh g(-1)) in the first cycle at a current density of 0.42 mA cm(-2) and 1006 mAh g(-1) over 150 cycles. Moreover, even at the highest current density (8.4 mA cm(-2)), the battery achieved 865 mAh g(-1). The stable electrochemical behaviors of the battery has achieved because of the mesoporous and interconnecting structure of MoO2-CNFs, proving high effect for ion transfer and electron conductive. Furthermore, this MoO2-CNFs interlayer could trap the polysulfides through strong polar surface interaction and increases the utilization of sulfur by confining the redox reaction to the cathode.

Li-S batteries have suffered from severe capacity fading and poor cyclability, resulting in low sulfur utilization. Herein, S-DHCS/CNTs are synthesized by integration of a double-hollow carbon sphere (DHCS) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and the addition of sulfur in DHCS by melt impregnations. The proposed S-DHCS/CNTs can effectively confine sulfur and physically suppress the diffusion of polysulfides within the double-hollow structures. CNTs act as a conductive agent. S-DHCS/CNTs maintain the volume variations and accommodate high sulfur content 73 wt%.

To overcome the low conductivity of natural sulfur and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide, the study proposes a novel sulfur film coated with three-dimensional nitrogen and cobalt-codoped polyhedral carbon wrapped on a multiwalled carbon nanotube sponge (3D-S@NCoCPC sponge) composite as a high-performance cathode material for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries. The interconnected conductive carbon network with abundant pores provides more room for the homogeneous distribution of sulfur within the composite and creates a favorable pathway for electrolyte permeability and lithium-ion diffusion. Moreover, the strong interaction between cobalt and lithium polysulfides leads to efficient suppression of the shuttle effect. In addition, the homogeneous distribution of sulfur and cobalt within the composite enhances electronic transfer for the conversion reaction of sulfur. As expected, the cathode with a high sulfur content of 77.5 wt % in the composite achieved a high initial discharge capacity of 1192 mA h g(-1) and high Coulombic efficiency of 99.98% after 100 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) current density. Stable performance was achieved with 92.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1000 mA/g current density.

Here, this paper reports a new strategy of using thiol-terminated polymeric matrices to prevent polysulfide dissolution, which exhibits an initial capacity of 829.1 mAh g(-1), and the exceptionally stable capacity retention of approximate to 84% at 1 C after 200 cycles, and excellent cycling stability with a low mean decay rate of 0.048% after 600 cycles. Significantly, in situ UV/vis spectroscopy analysis of the electrolyte upon battery cycling is performed to verify the function of preventing polysulfide dissolution by means of strongly anchoring discharge products of lithium sulphides. Moreover, density functional theory calculations reveal that the breakage of the linear sulfur chains results in the less soluble short-chain polysulfides due to the formation of the covalently crosslinked discharge products, which avoids the production of soluble long-chain polysulfide and minimizes the shuttle effect. These results exhibit an alternative for the stabilization of the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.

The main challenge in the development of long-life and high-Performance Li-S batteries is to simultaneously facilitate the redox kinetics of sulfur Species and suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. In this contribution, we present a general and green water-steam-etched approach for the fabrication of H- and O-incorporated porous TiS2, (HOPT). The conductivity, Porosity, chemisorptive capability, and electrocatalytic activity of HOPT are enhanced significantly when compared with those of raw TiS2. The synthetic method can be expanded to the fabrication, of other highly conductive transition metal dichalcogenides: such as porous NbS2 and coS(2). The as-obtained HOPT can serve as both a substitute of conductive agents and an additive of interlayer materials. The optimal electrode delivers, discharge capacities of 950 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5 C and 374 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 10 C. Impressively, an unprecedented reversible capacity of 172 mA h g(-1) is achieved after 2500 cycles at 30 C, and the average capacity fading rate per cycle is as low as 0.015%. Importantly, four half-cells based on this electrode in series could drive 60 light-emitting diode indicator modules (the nominal power 3 W) after 20 s of charging. The instantaneous current and power of this device on reaching 275 A g(-1) and 2611 W g(-1) respectively, indicate outstanding high-power discharge performance and Potential applications in electric vehicles and other large-scale energy storage systems.

The versatile textures and physicochemical characteristics of abundant biomass offer a great opportunity to prepare biochar materials that can enhance the performance of Li-S batteries in sustainable mode. Here, we exploit micro-/mesoporous coconut shell carbon (CSC) with high specific surface areas as a sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The sulfur-infiltrated CSC materials show superior discharge-charge capacity, cycling stabihty, and high rate capabihty. High discharge Capacities of 1599 and 1500 mA h g(-1) were achieved at current rates of 0.5 and 2.0 C,. respectively. A high reversible capacity of 517 mA h g(-1) was retained at 2.0 C even after 400 cycles. The results demonstrate a high retention and a deep lithiation of the CSC-confined sulfur. The success of this strategy provides insights into seeking high-performance biochar materials for Li-S batteries from abundant bioresources.

In this paper, we developed a facile strategy to fabricate P-doped carbon coated CNT skeleton coupled with nickel phosphide (Ni2P) nanospheres (PCCNT@NPS), and then we employed the as developed hybrid as a multifunctional modified interlayer onto PP separator (denoted as PCNPmPP) to face the challenge of LiPSs shuttling. The as-prepared hybrid provides abundant physical confinement and strong chemical adsorption for inhibiting polysulfides shuttling as well as efficient catalysis for accelerating LiPSs converting. As a result, the LSBs based on PCCNT@NPS modified PP separator have delivered a highly reversible cycling performance with high initial discharge capacity of 1067 mAh g(-1) and low capacity decay rate of 0.077% per cycle within 500 cycles at 1 C. The promising results demonstrate that the PCCNT@NPS composite is capable of effectively inhibiting the diffusion and shuttle of LiPSs. This paper provides a novel thinking for the synthesis of multifunctional interlayer onto PP separator for advanced LSBs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among other advantages, this electrochemical system has a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675 mAh g(-1), but suffers from several drawbacks: poor elemental sulfur conductivity, active material dissolution and use of the highly reactive lithium metal electrode. More particularly, the discharge capacity is known to be dictated by the short lithium polysulfide precipitation. These poorly soluble and highly insulating species are produced at the end of discharge, and are responsible for the positive electrode passivation and the early end of discharge. Nevertheless, the discharge capacity can be improved by working on the positive electrode specific surface area and morphology, as well as on the electrolyte composition. In this paper, we focused on the positive electrode issue. To this purpose, various current collector structures have been tested in order to achieve a high positive electrode surface area and a stable morphology during cycling. We demonstrated that the discharge capacity could be increased up to 1400 mAh g(-1) thanks to the use of carbon foam. As well, the capacity fading could be dramatically decreased in comparison with the one obtained for conventional sulfur composite electrodes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mixtures of ionic liquids and sulfones also show distinctly different physicochemical properties, including thermal properties and crystallization behavior. By using these electrolytes, lithium sulfur batteries assembled with lithium and mesoporous carbon composites show a reversible specific capacity of 1265 mAhg(-1) (second cycle) by using 40% 1.0M lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide with 60% 1.0M LiTFSI in methylisopropylsulfone in the first cycle. This capacity is slightly lower than that obtained in pure 1.0m LiTFSI as the sulfone electrolyte; however, it exhibits excellent cycling stability and remains as high as 655 mAhg(-1) even after 50 cycles.

We fabricate the polar MoSe2, Mo2C coupled with F-doped carbon fibers (FC), named as MoSe2@FC@Mo2C to serve as the step multi-electrocatalysts to selectively catalyze the short chain soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion (Li2S4 <-> Li2S) via the polar FC and the long chain LiPSs conversion (S-8 <-> Li2S4) via MoSe2 and Mo2C. The MoSe2@FC@Mo2C/S cathode material delivered a high specific capacity of 1359 mAh g(-1) (81% of its theoretical capacity) at 0.2C and excellent cycle performance when evaluated for Li-5 batteries. A high reversible capacity of 802 mAh g(-1) at 5C even with a lean E/5 of 5 mLg(-1), and a high sulfur loading of 5.5 mg cm(-2) was delivered, a favorable cycle behavior at 2C over 1000 cycles (0.029% decay per cycle) was obtained, corroborating the effective LiPSs shuttling relief and high LiPSs conversion efficacy.

The composition analysis and structure characteristics of samples are examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical performances of samples are measured by cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge experiments. The results show that N, B, S tridoped active carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) with abundant mesoporous structure enable fast Li+ transmittal and provide strong polysulfide adsorption ability. More importantly, they offer enough mechanical strength to support high sulfur loading (77 wt %) that maximizes their chemical role and can accommodate large volume changes. The N, B, S tridoped ACNTs/S composite exhibits a superb incipient capacity of 1166 mAh/g-S at 0.3 C and large reversible capacity of 881 mAh/g-S at the 700th cycle. To further promote the cyclic lifespan of LSB, the as-prepared N, B, S tridoped ACNTs acted as both sulfur matrix and spring functional layer and achieved a large reversible specific capacity of about 713 mAh/g-S at the 1400th cycle at lofty current density of 0.5 C with a slow capacity decay of 0.014% 1/cycle and a higher sulfur loading of 90 wt %. Accordingly, reasonable design for the heteroatom doping element in carbon material and separator modification will be distinctly vital for enhancing the electrochemical performance of the LSB and boosting its industrial application.

The strong interaction between polar Fe3O4 and lithium polysulfides effectively prevents the shuttling effect. Porous carbon coating layer and CNT network are further introduced into Fe3O4 nanoparticles to enlarge the specific surface area of the composite, improve its electronic conductivity, and boost the kinetic reactions. The confinement of polysulfides by Fe3O4 is supported by the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, the Li/S cells exhibit an initial discharge capacity as high as 1542 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, retain a long-term cyclability of 651 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 1000 cycles, and deliver a superior rate capability of 653 mAh g(-1) even at 5 C. Notably, the cells with the carbon nanotube/Fe3O4 coated by carbon (CNT/Fe3O4@C) modified separator with high sulfur loading can also exhibit superior cycling performance, deliver a high areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm(-2) over 60 cycles.

However, low sulfur utilization and poor redox kinetics are still key challenges to improving cycling efficiency. Herein, we develop a multi-functional polysulfide mediator based on carbon hollow nanospheres supported titanium nitride (C@TiN) dual-shell hollow nanospheres, in which the physical confinement, chemical adsorption, and catalysis for sulfur species conversion were successfully achieved simultaneously. As a result, C@TiN-S composites (approximately 70 wt% sulfur content) exhibit faster reaction kinetics and a higher polysulfide trap capability than that of C@TiO2-S composites when used as cathode materials in Li-S batteries. The C@TiN-S electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 453 mA h g(-1), coupled with a high average Coulombic Efficiency (similar to 99.0%). There is also limited capacitance decay (only 0.0033% per cycle), at a current density of 3 C, over 300 cycles. In particular, when the sulfur loading is increased to 4.2 mg cm(-2), the C@TiN-S electrode can provide a high capacity of 820 mA h g(-1) over 150 cycles at 0.2 C. DFT calculations reveal that the long-chain Li2S8 tend to break down into two shorter chain segments due to the strong interaction of TiN and LiPSs. Electrochemical analysis techniques indicate that TiN can effectively catalyze the reduction of polysulfide and the oxidation of Li2S during discharge and charge processes, respectively. Our work offers a new strategy to develop high-performance Li-S batteries based on multi-functional mediators.

To further improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, in this work we propose a new strategy involving the incorporation of a three-dimensional functional spongy framework as polysulfide reservoir layer, with strong absorbability and electrocatalytic activity towards sulfur species. The spongy framework has a hierarchical architecture composed of highly conductive Ni foam/graphene/carbon nanotubes/MnO2 nanoflakes (NGCM). The strongly interconnected Ni foam, graphene, and carbon nanotubes of the NGCM sponge facilitate electron transfer during discharge/charge processes; moreover, the superlyophilic properties of the NGCM sponge ensure good wettability and interface contact with the Li-S electrolyte, and the porous MnO2 nanoflakes provide strong chemisorptive and electrocatalytic effects on polysulfides (as confirmed theoretically and experimentally). The NGCM sponge, serving as a polysulfide reservoir layer attached on a conventional sulfur-mixed carbon nanotubes (S/CNTs) cathode, can provide improved reversible capacity, rate capability (593 mAh.g(-1) at 3.0 degrees C), and cycling stability. In addition, the self-discharge rate is greatly reduced, owing to the efficient conservation of polysulfides in the NGCM spongy framework.

To overcome these issues, we developed a three-dimensional carbon nanotube/Fe3O4 microspheres via spray drying and calcination as sulfur host materials (S/CNT/Fe3O4). In this three-dimensional microsphere structure, interwoven CNT backbone offers a robust conductive network with sufficient space for loading sulfur, and the polar Fe3O4 nanoparticles can enhance chemical adsorption of polysulfide. Benefiting from these advantages, the S/CNT/Fe3O4 cathode exhibit high initial discharge capacity (1270 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), superior rate performance (602 mAh g(-1) at 3 C), and long cyclic stability (only 0.084% capacity decay per cycle for 300 cycles at 1 C).

Herein, we report a conductive porous vanadium nitride nanoribbon/graphene composite accommodating the catholyte as the cathode of a lithium-sulfur battery. The vanadium nitride/graphene composite provides strong anchoring for polysulfides and fast polysulfide conversion. The anchoring effect of vanadium nitride is confirmed by experimental and theoretical results. Owing to the high conductivity of vanadium nitride, the composite cathode exhibits lower polarization and faster redox reaction kinetics than a reduced graphene oxide cathode, showing good rate and cycling performances. The initial capacity reaches 1,471mAhg(-1) and the capacity after 100 cycles is 1,252 mAhg(-1) at 0.2 C, a loss of only 15%, offering a potential for use in high energy lithium-sulfur batteries.

Whereas the slow redox kinetics and the shuttle effect of polysulfides (PSs) still severely restrict the performance of Li-S batteries. Here, a rational designed ferromagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (FM-Fe3O4 NPs) modified separator is engineered for Li-S batteries. Moreover, the particle size of FM-Fe3O4 NPs was tuned to enhance the energy storage performance. Consequently, the cells with FM-Fe3O4 NPs modified separator achieved a high-rate and long cycling performance, the specific capacity could reach 672.8 mAh g(-1) and a low fading rate (0.028 % per cycle over 700 cycles) at a high rate of 5 C. Experimental results reveals that FM-Fe3O4 NPs could mitigate shuttle effect, enable efficient redox reactions, and protect the Li anode from severe corrosion. The performance-enhanced mechanism is further discovered by DFT calculations, the results show that FM-Fe3O4 NPs act as mediators of redox reaction to block PSs shuttle and dynamically facilitate conversion via changing the molecular structure of PSs and reducing reaction barrier. This work provides a new pathway to improving Li-S batteries based on ferromagnetic materials, which may be generalized to other advanced batteries.

However, the polysulfides shuttling with slow redox kinetics has seriously hindered their practical applications. Herein, sulfur-deficient zinc sulfide (ZnS1-x) hollow polyhedrons are synthesized as the multifunctional sulfur host material via the sulfurization and high-temperature annealing method. The unique hollow structure could supply adequate void spaces for sulfur loading and alleviate volumetric expansion of sulfur upon the cycling process. Besides, ZnS1-x hollow polyhedrons with abundant sulfur vacancies can provide effective adsorption sites to chemically immobilize polysulfides and enhance polysulfides redox conversion as confirmed by theoretical calculation results and electrocatalytical experiments. Thus, the S/ZnS1-x cathode delivers the remarkable initial capacity (1206 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C) and excellent cycling stability (592 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C). The study points out the idea of functional cathode material for Li-S batteries based on a simple yet efficient vacancy engineering method. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The adopted cell configuration may actually allow the porous structure of the MOF derivative to efficiently enable the lithium/sulfur electrochemical process. Thus, structure, chemical composition, morphology and porosity of the composite are investigated by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and N(2 )adsorption/desorption isotherms, respectively. The data reveal a mesoporous material consisting of aggregated nanometric particles (<100 nm) with relatively high BET surface area (170 m(2) g(-1)), uniform element distribution, and a carbon content of about 13 wt%. Cyclic voltammetry of the Cr2O3@C in semi-liquid lithium sulfur cell using the catholyte solution shows a reversible reaction with fast kinetics and Li-diffusion coefficient ranging from about 3 x 10(-8)cm(2)s(-1) at 2.4 V vs. Li+/Li, to 1 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1) at 2 V vs. Li+/Li. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals a very stable interphase with an impedance below 5 Omega after an activation process promoted by cycling. The semi-liquid Li/S cell operates with remarkable stability and efficiency approaching 100%, delivers a capacity ranging from 900 mAh g(-1) at C/10 rate to 780 mAh g(-1) at C/3 rate, and performs over 100 charge/discharge cycles with very modest capacity decay.

Hence, a nitrogen and cobalt co-doped graphitized carbon (N-Co-C)-coated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with plenty of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was rationally designed. The composite had abundant multiple adsorptive and electrocatalytic sites to provide strong chemical trapping for polysulfides and simultaneously propel their electrochemical kinetics. The densely grafted small-diameter CNTs could shorten the ion-diffusion pathways and maintain the structural stability of the electrode materials. Meanwhile, abundant pore structures could provide enough volume for sulfur impregnation and physical adsorption of polysulfides.

However, the dissolution and shuttling problems of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are major obstacles hindering the performance and application of Li-S batteries. To address these issues, we report the rapid preparation of porous TiO2 nanoparticles (p-TiO2-NPs) as an effective sulfur host for Li-S batteries using a facile, scalable, and green one-step air oxidation strategy. Experimental results reveal that the p-TiO2-NPs have a mesopores-rich structure and strong chemical adsorption capability against LiPSs, which effectively mitigates the dissolution and shuttling of LiPSs by way of physical and chemical adsorptions. Incorporating highly conductive multi-wall carbon nanotubes to interconnect with the active materials, the p-TiO(2)NPs-based cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 1276 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and stable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.0526% per cycle at 1 C over 1200 cycles. This green and facile fabrication strategy can also be extended to other metal carbides to endow an environmentally friendly route for the sustainable development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

The effectiveness of the hybrid separator was verified by using a high sulfur cathode (70%). The modified separator effectively limited the migration of lithium polysulfides, improved the integrity of the sulfur cathode, and provided a conductive channel for ion and electron transport. As a result, the cell utilizing the separator coated with MWCNT and BTO (AHT-MWCNT-BTO) exhibited excellent electrochemical performance and rate kinetics, delivering a high initial discharge capacity of 1388.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C-rate, corresponding to 83% sulfur utilization in the electrode. Additionally, the cycling performance revealed a 77% capacity retention of the initial value after 100 repeated cycles at 0.5 C-rate. Furthermore, even at a high current density of 2.0 C, the cell with the AHT-MWCNT-BTO-coated separator delivered a discharge capacity of 422.8 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles, besides significantly increasing the sulfur utilization and effectively improving the electrochemical conversion of trapped polysulfides. These results reveal the exceptional potential of AHT-MWCNT-BTO-coated separators in the development of next generation high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Using the heterostructure catalysts is an effective way to solve the above problems, but how to further enhance the conversion efficiency and avoid the surface passivation by the insulative Li2S has not been well investigated. Herein, a heterostructure catalyst with rich heterointerfaces was prepared by modifying Mo2N microbelt with SnO2 nanodots. The formed rich interfaces with high accessibility act as the profitable nucleation sites guiding the Li2S 3D growth, which avoids the catalyst surface passivation and facilitates the LiPS conversion. The introduction of SnO2 nanodots also enhances the LiPS adsorption. Thus, the assembled battery with the above catalyst as the cathode additive shows a high capacity of 738.3 mAh g(-1) after 550 cycles at 0.5 C with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.025% per cycle. Even with high sulfur loading of 9.0 mg cm(-2), good cyclic stability is also achieved at 0.5 C with a low E/S ratio of 5 mu L mgs(-1). This work shows an effective way to enhance the LiPS conversion kinetics and guide Li2S deposition in Li-S batteries.

However, the low electronic conductivity of S8 and Li2S, shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and sluggish reaction kinetics hinder the advance of Li-S batteries. The key to addressing the issues mentioned above is to improve the electrical conductivity of the cathode, enhance the absorption of LiPSs and accelerate the conversion. Nevertheless, it is a great challenge to simultaneously optimize them all. In this study, by incorporating the virtues of the large lamellar structure and strong nonpolar adsorption of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), strong polar polysulfide adsorption of Fe7S8 and excellent catalytic polysulfide activity of CoS2, a CoS2/Fe7S8 heterostructure grown on the nitrogen-doped rGO (CoS2/Fe7S8/NG) was prepared. Besides, the experiments demonstrate that the designed CoS2/Fe7S8/NG possesses strong absorption and superior catalytic ability towards LiPSs. Subsequently, when applied as a modification layer for the polypropylene (PP) separator, the CoS2/Fe7S8/NG-PP coupled with CNT/S cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity (1459 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g-(1)), a reversible capacity of 731 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g- 1 mass loading of ~ 3.8 mg cm-2 can still display a reversible capacity of 663 mAh g-(1 )after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g-( 1).

Considerable efforts have been developed to improve the redox reversibility and suppress sulfur loss when maintaining their capacities. However, few strategies have enlightened to address shuttle issues via electric field -responsive film. Here, we postulate a new strategy to create smart electric-field-responsive surface structure and design special molecular film with quaternary ammonium group. The responsive film bonded to carbon matrix can act as a switch to control the on-off of polysulfide channels. Meanwhile, the prepared carbon aerogel (CA) matrix presents highly cross-linked 3D framework, abundant hierarchical pore channels and high specific surface area. The results show the composite sulfur cathode with selective film exhibits outstanding high discharging capacities and long-term cycling stability. Specifically, the cathode with 61.6 wt% sulfur displays an initial specific capacity of 1307 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and maintains 84.0% after 100 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance may mainly benefit from the switch function of self-responsive film, effectively preventing polysulfides escaping from the cathode, suppressing shuttle effect and enhancing the utilization of sulfur. Furthermore, the adsorption calculation by the density functional theory (DFT) shows trapping role of beta-cyclodextrin quaternary ammonium (CDQA) to polysulfides. The DFT simulation further supports the confining and switching mechanism. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur as an active material and the continuous shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) limit the further application of LSBs. In this work, metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived layered double hydroxide (LDH) wrapped with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is designed and prepared as an effective sulfur host for LSBs. Thanks to high specific surface area of LDH/rGO, the adsorption of LDH for LiPSs, and the excellent electronic conductivity of rGO, the electrochemical performance of S/LDH/rGO is greatly improved. The S/LDH/rGO delivers the first discharge capacity of 958 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C with a Coulombic efficiency of 99%. Even at a high current density of 1C, the discharge capacity of the S/LDH/rGO still reaches to 730 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle. The LDH/rGO is a potential sulfur host for LSBs.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recently studied as functionalizable platforms to improve Li-S battery performance. However, many MOF-enabled Li-S technologies are hindered by low capacity retention and poor long-term performance due to low electronic conductivity. In this work, we combine the advantages of a Zr-based MOF-808 loaded with sulfur as the active material with a graphene/ethyl cellulose additive, leading to a high-density nanocomposite electrode requiring minimal carbon. Our electrochemical results indicate that the nanocomposites deliver enhanced specific capacity over conventionally used carbon/binder mixtures, and postsynthetic modification of the MOF with lithium thiophosphate results in further improvement. Furthermore, the dense form factor of the sulfur-loaded MOF-graphene nanocomposite electrodes provides high volumetric capacity compared to other works with significantly more carbon additives. Overall, we have demonstrated a proof-of-concept paradigm where graphene nanosheets facilitate improved charge transport because of enhanced interfacial contact with the active material. This materials engineering approach can likely be extended to other MOF systems, contributing to an emerging class of two-dimensional nanomaterial-enabled Li-S batteries.

The pores uniformly distributed in N-CNFs result in the improvement of electrical conductivity, increasing of BET surface area (142.82 m(2) g(-1)), and high porosity. The as-synthesized 3D free-standing N-CNFs membrane was applied as the current collector and binder free containing Li2S6 catholyte for lithium-sulfur batteries. As a novel composite cathode, the free-standing N-CNFs/Li2S6 membrane shows more stable electrochemical behavior than the CNFs/Li2S6 membrane, exhibiting a high first-cycle discharge specific capacity of 1175 mAh g(-1)at 0.1 C and keeping discharge specific capacity of 702 mAh g(-1) at higher rate. More importantly, as the sulfur mass in cathodes was increased at 7.11 mg, the N-CNFs/Li2S6 membrane delivered 467 mAh g(-1)after 150 cycles at 0.2 C. The excellent electrochemical properties of N-CNFs/Li2S6 membrane can be ascribed to synergistic effects of high porosity and nitrogen-doping in N-CNFs from carbonized ZIF-8, illustrating collective effects of physisorption and chemisorption for lithium polysulfides in discharge-charge processes.

Enhanced sulfur utilization in lithium-sulfur batteries by hybrid modified separators	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Li-S battery; Polysulfide; Carbon nanotube; Layered double hydroxide; Chemical bonding	PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; KINETICS; REDOX; POLYSULFIDES; ELECTRODE	The extraordinary energy density and low cost enable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries to be a promising alternative to traditional energy storage systems. The principal hurdle facing Li-S batteries is the unsatisfactory utilization of sulfur cathodes. The detrimental shuttle issue of polysulfides and the sluggish charge transfer kinetics result in quick capacity degradation of Li-S batteries. An MFLC hybrid material composed of manganese-iron layered double hydroxides (Mn-Fe LDH) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) has been developed. Such heterostructure combines the advantages of effective chemical bonding of Mn-Fe LDH towards polysulfides with the high conductivity of CNT. When modified on a polypropylene (PP) separator, the hybrid material is proven to significantly inhibit the shuttle issue of polysulfides and accelerate their redox reaction kinetics. Li-S batteries with MFLC-modified separators revealed considerably improved electrochemical performance. A high initial capacity of 1138 mA h g(-1) and 70 % capacity retention after 200 cycles were achieved at 0.2 C. The enhanced sulfur utilization can be directly evaluated from the discharge voltage plateaus. The results indicate a new solution for the practical application of Li-S batteries and provide a simple approach to determine the efficiency of sulfur utilization.

One of the problems to be solved is promoting the conversion of polysulfides while maintaining high sulfur utilization. Complex double-layered hollow nanostructures have attracted wide attention as battery cathode materials. A ZIF-67 nanocube is used as a template to form a double-layer hollow structure (denoted as CoS) in which the inner layer is a CoS nanobox and the outer shell is a CoS nanosheet. In general, the double-layer hollow structure not only maximizes the encapsulation of sulfur but also provides sufficient reaction sites to optimize the electrochemical properties of the material. As a cathode material for Li-S batteries, cobalt-based sulfides also improve electrochemical performance due to their high electronic conductivity and abundance of redox reaction sites. The initial discharge capacity of the battery at 0.1 C was 1275.76 mA h g(-1), demonstrating excellent rate performance.

HGC derived from graphene oxides and polyvinylidene fluoride polymers, combined with the advantages of graphene and porous carbon nanospheres, exhibits a hierarchically micro/mesoporous structure with an ultralarge specific surface area of up to 3182 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 1.91 cm(3) g(-1). Graphene as a conducting network can enhance electronic conductivity, while porous nanospheres like a reservoir can effectively store and immobilize sulfur particles. HGC/sulfur electrode material obtained via a melting infusion process exhibits high reversible specific capacity of 1250 mA h g(-1) with a high sulfur content of 74.5 wt %, and it still has a capacity of 916 mA h g(-2) after 100 cycles, which is better than that of pristine porous graphene and carbon nanospheres. Furthermore, the relative capacity decay of the HGC/sulfur electrode is only 0.005 and 0.004% per cycle at 2 C and 4 C, respectively, after 450 charge/discharge cycles, exhibiting remarkable performance in terms of long-term electrochemical stability.

J	Kang, H; Park, MJ				Kang, Haneol; Park, Moon Jeong			Thirty-minute synthesis of hierarchically ordered sulfur particles enables high-energy, flexible lithium-sulfur batteries	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Sulfur microparticles; Vulcanization; Fast polysulfide conversion; High-energy batteries; Flexible lithium-sulfur batteries	ELEMENTAL-SULFUR; INVERSE VULCANIZATION; NETWORK STRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; CATHODES; ELECTRODES	An innovative lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery technology is proposed that provides high energy density, fast charging, and mechanical flexibility. Via the rapid (30 min) one-pot reaction of elemental sulfur and vinyl phosphonic acid (VPA), SVPA microparticles containing dissimilar sulfur allotropes were developed. The spontaneous formation of wrinkles and pores on the particles facilitates electrolyte access and alleviates mechanical stress during battery cycling. The large surface area created by the ordered sulfur domains enhances lithium diffusion coefficients and facilitates polysulfide conversion kinetics in the Li-S cells, leading to a high discharge capacity of 1529 mAh.g(-1) at 0.05 C and excellent rate performance (721 mAh.g(-1) at 7 C). Additionally, owing to the inherent electrode porosity imparted by SVPA microparticles, a high areal capacity of similar to 5 mAh.cm(-2) is obtained at increased cathode loadings. Abundant phosphonate moieties at the surfaces and interfaces of particles act as effective chemical anchors for lithium polysulfides, thereby mitigating the shuttle effects, which can prolong cycle lives at various C rates. The impressive properties of the SVPA microparticles are demonstrated for Li-S pouch cells, which exhibit stable operation under various deformations and highlight the SVPA microparticles as a promising candidate for next-generation Li-S batteries for wearable electronics	[Kang, Haneol; Park, Moon Jeong] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Chem, Pohang 37673, South Korea		Park, MJ (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol POSTECH, Dept Chem, Pohang 37673, South Korea.	moonpark@postech.ac.kr			National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology) [NRF-2017R1A2B3004763]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT) [NRF-2017R1A5A1015365]; Creative Materials Discovery Program through the NRF - Ministry of Science and ICT [2018M3D1A1058624]	National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology)(National Research Foundation of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (Ministry of Science and ICT)(National Research Foundation of Korea); Creative Materials Discovery Program through the NRF - Ministry of Science and ICT	This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Grant No. NRF-2017R1A2B3004763) (Ministry of Science and ICT, Grant No. NRF-2017R1A5A1015365) .

However, the poor electrical conductivity of sulfur, shuttle effect, and slow electrochemical kinetics hinder their application. Herein, cobalt disulfides uniformly in situ grow on the surface of carbon nanotubes to prepare a three-dimensional carbon nanotubes-cobalt disulfide composite material as the sulfur host. The in situ growth cobalt disulfides on the carbon nanotube is confirmed to play the role of electrocatalyst, triggering the oxidation reaction of Li2S6 and Li2S4 at a higher potential, which promotes the conversion of Li2S6 to Li2S4 and Li2S4 to Li2S2, respectively, and significantly enhances the electrochemical reaction kinetics during the charge and discharge process. Particularly, the carbon nanotubes-cobalt disulfide-20 composite provides a suitable number of active sites for Li2S6 and Li2S4 and exerts an initial discharge capacity of 1253mAhg(-1) at 0.1 C and a retentive capacity of 84% after 200cycles at 0.2 C.

However, poor conductivity and a large volume change in S during cycling, together with a shuttle effect of polysulfides, severely restrict the battery performance, and remain a great challenge. Herein, inspired by a natural dandelion structure, we present a novel biomimetic S-coated carbon nanotube composite consisting of dandelion-like three-dimensional carbon nanotubes coated with S particles on the surface. Carbon nanotubes provide high-speed electron transfer pathways for S during cycling, while the special dandelion-like morphology provides a suitable environment for accommodating the volume change in S upon charge-discharge. The dandelion-like S-coated carbon nanotube-based Li-S batteries exhibit a stable capacity exceeding 760 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.1 C, along with a Coulombic efficiency as high as 99.9%. Even under repeated rounds of rate-performance measurements, and cycling at different charge versus discharge rates, the batteries retain high capacities and good recovery capabilities. In addition, the proportion of capacitive contribution in the overall capacity is high, indicating a good reversible capacity provided by the composite.

However, the polysulfide shuttle effect, which is the result of dissolution of many intermediate polysulfides in electrolyte, has still remained unsolved. In this study, we have designed a sulfur-filled dual core-shell spindle-like nanorod structure coated with manganese oxide (S@HCNR@MnO2) to achieve a high-performance cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. The cathode showed an initial discharge capacity of 1661 mA h g(-1) with 80% retention of capacity over 70 cycles at a 0.2C rate. Furthermore, compared with the nanorods without any coating (S@HCNR), the MnO2-coated material displayed superior rate capability, cycling stability, and Coulombic efficiency. The synergistic effects of the nitrogen-doped hollow carbon host and the MnO2 second shell are responsible for the improved electrochemical performance of this nanostructure.

Herein, we first reported the synthesis of ordered micro-mesoporous carbon (OMMC) nano-spheres embedded with ultrafine iron carbide (Fe3C) nanocrystals by a facile one-step carbonizing process as effective sulfur host materials. As expected, the Fe3C/OMMC nanospheres (Fe3C/OMMC NSs) can realize homogeneous loading of sulfur, strong adsorption and catalysis of LiPSs with high efficiency, and promote uniform nucleation of Li2S through the ordered micro-mesoporous structures and ultrafine (average 5 nm) Fe3C nanocrystals. The Fe3C/OMMC-S NSs cathodes achieved excellent sulfur utilization, outstanding cyclic stability (700 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C after 1000 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.033% per cycle) and impressive rate performance (656 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C).

However, their low active material utilization and poor cycle life limit their practical application. The use of a carbon-coated separator in these batteries serves to inhibit the migration of the lithium polysulfide intermediate and increases the recyclability. We report the extent to which the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery systems depends on the characteristics of the carbon coating of the separator. Carbon-coated separators containing different ratios of carbon black (Super-P) and vapor-grown carbon fibers (VGCFs) were prepared and evaluated in Li-S batteries. The results showed that larger amounts of Super-P on the carbon-coated separator enhanced the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries; for instance, the pure Super-P coating exhibited the highest discharge capacity (602.1 mAh g(-1) at 150 cycles) with a Coulombic efficiency exceeding 95%. Furthermore, the separators with the pure Super-P coating had a smaller pore structure, and hence, limited polysulfide migration, compared to separators containing Super-P/VGCF mixtures. These results indicate that it is necessary to control the porosity of the porous membrane to control the movement of the lithium polysulfide.

Such rationally designed M-MGCSs synergistically combine the merits of micro- and mesoporous carbons when used as the sulfur host in Li-S batteries: the core having interconnected spherical mesopores of 9.0 nm provides sufficient space for loading S-8 molecules, while the shell having micropores of 0.6 nm can entrap only small S2-4 molecules, which are converted into electrolyte-insoluble polysulfides during discharge, minimizing the outward diffusion of long-chain polysulfides from the core. These advantageous structural features, combined with the highly graphitic nature and mesoscale spherical morphology of M-MGCSs, enable Li-S cathodes with greatly improved performance even at high sulfur areal loadings.

However, the low S contents in their electrodes and the shuttling effect of soluble polysulfides can significantly deteriorate their capacities and cycle lives. Herein, we demonstrate a uniquely structured composite electrode, named porous polymerized vinyl acetate (p-PVAc) thin films, to break through the "trade-off" between the energy density and rate capability. S nanoparticles were encapsulated by porous p-PVAc layers and then anchored on graphene (p-PVAc/S/G), facilitating ion exchange and electron transfer during electrochemical operations. Consequently, p-PVAc/S/G delivered a high specific capacity of 719 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and exceeded even 350 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 5 A g(-1), whereas the average Coulombic efficiency was preserved to be higher than 98.50% when repeated for more than 300 cycles at 1 A g(-1).

Petroleum Coke as the Active Material for Negative Electrodes in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						lithium&#8211; sulfur battery; petroleum coke; graphite; metal lithium; electrochemical properties; energy characteristics	HARD CARBON; ANODE MATERIALS; ION; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; GRAPHITE; LI2SO4	The possibility of using carbon materials based on petroleum coke as the cheap and available active material for negative electrodes of lithium-sulfur rechargeable batteries is considered. The comparative studies of characteristics of lithium-sulfur cells with negative electrodes based on metal lithium, graphite, and petroleum coke are carried out. It is found that heat-treated petroleum coke can be successfully used as the active material for negative electrode of lithium-sulfur batteries with acceptable energy characteristics. All other conditions being the same, the lithium-sulfur cells with negative electrodes based on petroleum coke demonstrate the longer cyclability as compared with cells based on metal lithium or graphite. This is explained by the slower destruction of electrolyte components on the negative electrode during cycling of lithium-sulfur cells.

The former mainly result from the "shuttle" mechanism due to the dissolution of the reaction intermediates lithium polysulfides; the latter can be attributed to the highly flammable electrolyte. To overcome these problems, we prepared a series of Li-S battery electrolytes based on ionic liquid of (N-methoxyethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide, P1,2O1TFSI) and cosolvents of tris(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (TEGDME) with lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (LiTFSI) as lithium salt. The electrolyte provides a counterbalance between shuttle suppression and solubility of lithium polysulfides by combining the ionic liquid and TEGDME in the optimum mass ratio of 7:3. The 0.4 mol kg(-1) LiTFSI-P1,2O1TFSI/(30wt%) TEGDME electrolyte exhibits good ion transport (room temperature ionic conductivity of 4.303 mS cm(-1)) and safety (self-extinguishing time of 4.8 s g(-1)). The Li-S batteries with the 0.4 mol kg(-1) LiTFSI-P1,2O1TFSI/(30wt%) TEGDME electrolyte possess the high discharge capacity (1212.8 mAh g(-1) for the first cycle at 0.1C), excellent rate capability (886.5 mAh g(-1) at 1C) and good cycling performance (capacity retention of 93.3% after 100 cycles with the coulombic efficiency above 95% at 1C). Moreover, this electrolyte could operate at 80 degrees C in Li-S cells indicating the excellent high temperature performance. This research gives a new insight for designing ionic liquid-based electrolyte for the safe Li-S batteries with high performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the success is hindered by the nature of Li2S and corresponding reduction species, including low conductivity and the shuttling phenomenon. Herein, we simply coat graphene films directly onto the Li2S cathode, which can suppress polysulfides dissolution effectively. The electrochemical performance of the cathode depending on graphene interlayer thickness (0, 20, 45, 54, 77 and 88 mu m) has been investigated. Li2S cathode with the 45 pm thick interlayer exhibits initial discharge capacity of 1029.21 mAh g (1) and 779.74 mAh g (1) at 0.05C and 0.1C, respectively, and capacity retention of above 60% with coulombic efficiency of around 90% over 300 cycles at high C rates. The results are discussed in terms of the graphene film thickness and the conductivity of the film as well as Li ion diffusivity. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The strong chemical interaction of lithium polysulfides with MoS2 and nitrogen rich g-C3N4 restrict the shuttling effect of polysulfides, showing stable cycling and excellent rate performance of Li-S batteries by delivering a specific capacity of 430mAh/g after 400 cycles at 8C rate with a low capacity-fading rate of 0.028% per cycle. For the cathode with high areal loading of 4.3 mg/cm(2), it gives a very good capacity retention with a decay rate of 0.070% per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5C. The dramatic improvement in lithium-ion diffusion is responsible for the high rate capability. The cells also exhibit an effective suppression of self-discharge. They deliver a specific discharge capacity retention of 93.60% and maintain cycling stability for 500 cycles at 1C with 0.08% per cycle decay rate after 10 days of resting. The results demonstrate that integration of both physical entrapment and chemical interaction with polysulfides could be an effective strategy for developing high performance Li-S batteries.

However, their practical application is hindered by their short cycling life and low volumetric capacity. Herein, compact, flexible, and free-standing films with a sandwich structure are designed simply by vacuum filtration, in which nanosulfur is homogenously coated by graphene and poly(3,4-ethylene- dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). This unique hierarchical structure not only provides a highly conductive network and intimate contacts between nanosulfur and graphene/PEDOT:PSS for effective charge transportation, but also offers synergistic physical restriction and chemical confinement of dissoluble intermediate lithium polysulfides during electrochemical processes. Therefore, these conductive compact films, used directly as cathodes, show the highest reversible volumetric capacity of 1432 Ah L-1 at 0.1 C and 1038 Ah L-1 at 1 C, and excellent cycling stability with a minimal decay rate of 0.04% per cycle over 500 cycles at I C. Meanwhile, remarkable rate performance with a high capacity of 701 mAh g(-1) at 4 C is also achieved. Soft-packaged batteries based on this flexible cathode are further fabricated and demonstrate excellent mechanical and electrochemical properties with little capacity decay under folded state, highlighting the practical application of our deliberately designed electrode in a flexible power system.

However, the practical utilization of Li-S batteries is still obstructed by the shuttle effects which inducing the fast capacity fading and the loss of active sulfur. Herein, a special graphene @ nitrogen and phosphorous dual-doped porous carbon (N-P-PC/G) is presented to modify a commercial separator for an advanced Li-S battery. The N-P-PC/G nanosheet employs graphene layer as an excellent conductive framework covered with uniform layers of N, P dual-doped porous carbon on both sides which possessing massive interconnected meso-/micropores. It is demonstrated that the N-P-PC/G-modified separator can suppress the shuttle effects by coupling interactions including physical absorption, chemical adsorption and interfacial interaction. With the aid of the N-P-PC/G-modified separator, the pure sulfur cathode with high-sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2) offers a high initial discharge capacity of 1207 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA h g(-1)), and a maintained capacity of 635 mA h g(-1) (fading rate of only 0.095% per cycle), after 500 cycles. This work suggests that combining hybrid nanocarbon with multi-heteroatom doping to modify the commercial separator is an effective approach to obtain high electrochemical performance Li-S batteries.

The particles can work efficiently as a sulfur-host material for lithium-sulfur batteries. Specifically, the well-defined porous Ti4O7 particles exhibit interconnected pores in the interior and have a high-surface area of 592 m(2) g(-1); this shows the advantage of mesopores for encapsulating of sulfur and provides a polar surface for chemical binding with polysulfides to suppress their dissolution. Moreover, in order to improve the conductivity of the electrode, a thin layer of carbon is coated on the Ti4O7 surface without destroying its porous structure. The porous Ti4O7 and carbon-coated Ti4O7 particles show significantly improved electrochemical performances as cathode materials for Li-S batteries as compared with those of TiO2 particles.

Conventional carbonaceous materials are difficult to effectively adsorb polysulfides, and polar metal oxides are expected to adsorb polysulfides through strong interactions and promote electrochemical conversion. In this work, carbon nanotubes/MIL-88B microspheres were obtained by simple spray-drying, subsequently, carbon nanotubes/Fe3O4@C (CNT/Fe3O4@C) composites were obtained by high-temperature calcination, and Fe3O4@C nanorods was derived from MIL-88B. The interwoven CNT network forms a three-dimensional conductive path, which ensures that the sulfur cathode has excellent conductivity. The polar Fe3O4 nanoparticles are covered by carbon layer, which not only adsorb polysulfides through strong interaction, but also serve as a catalyst to improve the kinetics of chemical reactions. Benefiting from these characteristics, the CNT/Fe3O4@C composite is considered to be an excellent sulfur host, LiS batteries exhibit superior cyclability performance (with 0.062% decay per cycle at 1.5C), exceptional rate performance (674 mAh g(-1) at 3C), and high area capacity (4.1 mAh cm(-2) at 0.2C).

However, it is still a great challenge to explore stable sulfur cathode with high sulfur loading and good cycling performance. Herein, we report a facile method to prepare N,S co-doped hierarchical pore structured carbon foam @porous carbon (CF@N-SPC) through a carbonation process from resin aerogel coated melamine foam with thiourea as the source for N and S codoping. The close combination of a carbon interconnected skeleton and the resin aerogel derived carbon forms the hierarchical pore structure that improves the electron and ion transport. The prepared CF@N-SPC can be used as a freestanding cathode without a conductive additive and a binder. Due to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical pore structure and N, S codoping, the sulfur loading in the carbon foam-based cathode can reach up to 10.6 mg cm(-2). Owing to these unique merits, the CF@N-SPC/S cathode exhibits high capacity and good cycling performance: it yields a discharge capacity of 1212 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C with 4.0 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading; it also exhibits a good discharge capacity of 668 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C when the sulfur loading increases to 10.6 mg cm(-2), capacity retained by 72% in 200 cycles; it experiences a very small capacity decay rate of 0.05% per cycle in 700 cycles at 1 C. Our rational design and facile synthesis of the carbon foam-based freestanding cathode is promising and applicable for development of high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, pollen-derived porous carbon/cuprous phosphide (PC/Cu3P) hybrids were rationally synthesized using a one-step carbonization method using pollen as the source material, acting as the sulfur host for LSBs. In the hybrid, polar Cu3P can markedly inhibit the "shuttle effect" by regulating the adsorption ability toward polysulfides, as confirmed by theoretical calculations and experimental tests. As an example, the camellia pollen porous carbon (CPC)/Cu3P/S electrode shows a high capacity of 1205.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.038% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 1 C, and a rather high initial Coulombic efficiency of 98.5%. The CPC/Cu3P LSBs can work well at high temperatures, having a high capacity of 545.9 mAh g(-1) at 1 C even at 150 degrees C. The strategy of the PC/Cu3P hybrid proposed in this study is expected to be an ideal cathode for ultrastable high-temperature LSBs. We believe that this strategy is universal and worthy of in-depth development for the next generation energy storage devices.

The as-synthesize fibrous Co, N-CNEs membrane was employed as positive current collector containing Li2S6 catholyte solution for lithium sulfur batteries. Co, N-CNEs inhibited the dissolution of polysulfides shuttle effect and demonstrated as positive catalyst accelerating kinetic redox reaction of lithium polysulfides/sulfide. In addition, metallic cobalt achieves the purpose of reducing polarization and increasing specific capacity by promoting nucleation of lithium sulfide on the surface of Co, N-CNEs. Li2S6 catholyte impregnated Co, N-CNEs electrode (sulfur loading: 4.74 mg) exhibits the first discharge capacity of 1166 mA h g(-1) and matins at 938 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.2 C, which is superior cycling performance than N-CNEs. Even at 7.11 mg sulfur loading, the composite electrode shows a high area capacity of 6.47 mA h cm(-2). Furthermore, a steady-state of lithium anode resulting through effective suppression of polysulfide shuttle effect is also demonstrated to contribute significantly to enhance electrochemical performance.

However, their practical application is hindered by the severe shuttle effect of polysulfides and the low conductivity of sulfur cathode. Herein, we design a titanium nitride host with a three-dimensional honeycomb-like structure via a spray drying method, which has the advantages of metallic conductivity and ultrafast anchoring to realize efficient adsorption and conversion of polysulfide. The honeycomb-like architecture can shorten the diffusion path of lithium ions, and buffer the volume change of sulfur, which can improve reaction kinetics and maintain the stability of the material structure. As a result, the sulfur cathode based on titanium nitride host exhibits an excellent cycling performance with a stable capacity of 650.4 mAh g(-1) within 500 cycles at 100 mA g(-1). The excellent performance shows the importance of designing cathode materials with reasonable structures in lithium sulfur batteries.

Although lignin has been widely used as building blocks for fabricating nanofibers, it is still very challenging to synthesize conducting heterostructured carbon nanofibers without using additional catalysts. Herein, we first in-situ grew graphene grafted carbon nanofibers (G/CNFs) using calcium lignin sulfonate as starting materials without addition of catalysts. Through the electrospinning, pyrolysis and washing procedure, the as-spun nanofibers are converted into the flexible G/CNFs films. The in-situ formed CaS nanoparticles serve as catalysts for the growth of graphene on the surface of the CNFs, when the carbonization temperature is over 1100 degrees C. The as-prepared G/CNFs films exhibit superior electronic conductivity of 2377.9 S m(-1) , which is comparable to the values reported in the literature. As a proof-of-concept, the as-fabricated lithium-sulfur battery exhibits a high discharge of 808.7 mAh.g(-1) after 600 cycles at 0.2 C by using the G/CNFs membrane as stand-alone and flexible sulfur cathode scaffolds. This work represents a promising new approach for designing heterostructured graphene/CNFs using low-cost lignin precursors, and provides significant insights for the sustainable development of CNFs in numerous applications.

Here, to solve these issues, a synergistic engineering strategy is proposed to rationally fabricate porous core-shell Co@CoO1-x nanosheets array grown on carbon cloth (CC/Co@CoO1-x) as a sulfur host. The porous two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets array structure endows CoO1-x shells with highly exposed active sites, leading to strong LiPS adsorption ability. Besides, abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) enhance the electrical conductivities of CoO1-x shells and facilitate the breakage of the S-S bond in adsorbed LiPS. Furthermore, the underneath metallic Co cores with few grain boundaries coupled with CC form integrated and continuous conductive networks, which achieves fast electron transfer from CC to CoO1-x surfaces to accelerate the immobilized LiPS conversion. Due to the synergistic effect of sulfophilic CoO1-x shells and conductive Co cores, the CC/Co@CoO1-x host enables a high-performance Li-S battery with excellent performance even at a high sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2). This work highlights the effectiveness of combination 2D core-shell heterostructure with OVs to inhibit shuttle effect of LiPS and meanwhile boost sulfur conversion, which can guide the future design of high-performance sulfur hosts.

However, despite these attractive attributes, the commercialization of lithium-sulfur battery is primarily hindered by the parasitic reactions between the Li metal anode and dissolved polysulfide species from the cathode during the cycling process. Herein, we synthesize the sulfur-rich carbon polysulfide polymer and demonstrate that it is a promising cathode material for high performance lithium-sulfur battery. The electrochemical studies reveal that the carbon polysulfide polymer exhibits superb reversibility and cycle stability. This is due to that the well-designed structure of the carbon polysulfide polymer has several advantages, especially, the strong chemical interaction between sulfur and the carbon framework (C-S bonds) inhibits the shuttle effect and the p electrons of the carbon polysulfide compound enhance the transfer of electrons and Li+. Furthermore, as-prepared carbon polysulfide polymer-graphene hybrid cathode achieves outstanding cycle stability and relatively high capacity. This work highlights the potential promise of the carbon polysulfide polymer as the cathode material for high performance lithium-sulfur battery.

The specific surface area of CoO/SnO2@NC composite is 85.464 m(2)center dot g(-1), and the pore volume is 0.1189 cm(3)center dot g(-1). The hollow core-shell structure as a carrier has a sulfur loading amount of 66.10%. The initial specific capacity of the assembled Li-S batteries is 395.7 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.2 C, which maintains 302.7 mAh center dot g(-1) after 400 cycles. When the rate increases to 2.5 C, the specific capacity still has 221.2 mAh center dot g(-1). The excellent lithium storage performance is attributed to the core-shell structure with high specific surface area and porosity. This structure effectively increases the sulfur loading, enhances the chemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides, and reduces direct contact between CoO/SnO2 and the electrolyte.

Herein, a unique three-dimensional hierarchical microsphere architecture assembled by oxygen-deficient La(OH)(3) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), as the sulfur host material for Li/S batteries, has been rationally designed using a facile spray-drying method for the first time. The robust microsphere architecture can reduce ion diffusion pathways and provide adequate space to modulate volume variation during cycling. It is noted that the abundant inner void spaces in the microspheres formed by rGO and oxygen-deficient La(OH)(3) nanorod stacking provide physical adsorption for polysulfides. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl groups and defective sites on the surface of polar La(OH)(3) nanorods provide strong chemical adsorption to lithium polysulfides, which was confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Additionally, rich oxygen-deficient La(OH)(3) nanorods as an effective electrocatalyst promote the reversibility and conversion kinetics of polysulfides. The fast polysulfide conversion reactions can prevent accumulation in the cathode and loss in the electrolyte. Consequently, a sulfur cathode with rGO-La(OH)(3) exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 1160.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and retains long-term stability for a capacity of 541.7 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1C.

However, the shuttling effect, dissolution of sulfur/lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and sluggish redox kinetics in Li-S batteries restricted its long-term application and development. Herein, an advanced sulfur immobilizer composed of SnP0.94 nanodot electrocatalysts@porous hollow carbon aerogel (SnP0.94@PHCA) was synthesized. As expected, the synergistic sulfur host can not only act as a good electrochemical interface but also provide adequate accommodation for active materials to alleviate the LiPS diffusion. More importantly, SnP0.94 nanodot electrocatalysts supported on the conductive PHCA skeleton effectively expedited the conversion/redox reaction kinetics and also constructed a stronger adsorption system for LiPSs to inhibit the LiPS shuttling behavior. Correspondingly, the SnP0.94@PHCA composite endowed the sulfur cathode the outstanding specific capacity of 1017.8 mAh g-1 under a high sulfur loading (2.94 mg cm-2) at 0. 1 C, superior rate performance (579.8 mAh g-1 at 1 C), excellent cycling stability (the capacity decay rate of 0.13% per cycle at 0.5 C), and a high areal capacity of 6.9 mAh cm-2 under starved electrolyte conditions (8.6 mu L mgs- 1). This work opens up a new direction for constructing the electroactive hosts in Li-S batteries.

The self-healing characteristic of binder induced by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and S-S dynamic covalent bonds can repair volume expansion cracks. The polar groups and excellent conductivity endue binder with strong chemisorption on polysulfides and fast charge transportation, which can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect and accelerate polysulfides redox kinetics. More important, the considerable flame retardant performance of binder can improve the safety of the Li-S batteries. As a result, the Li-S cells using FHCP binder deliver an outstanding cycle stability of a high-capacity retention rate of 85% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, and a high reversible area specific capacity of 5.25 mAh cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of 4.72 mg cm(-2) and a correspondingly lean electrolyte condition (E/S ratio = 6 mu L mg(-1)).

By taking advantage of this solution-based self-assembly synthesis route, poisonous and noxious reagents and complicated fabrication processes are rendered unnecessary, thereby simplifying its manufacturing and decreasing the cost of the final product. Transmission and scanning electronic microscopy observations indicated the formation of the three-dimensional interconnected S/GO/MWNT composite through the environmentally friendly process. The GO layers and long MWNTs synergistically constructed hierarchical electron/ion pathways, favoring the ion transport and electrolyte diffusion. The interlaced network can serve as sponges to physically absorb polysulfides to their wrinkled surface and porous structure. In addition, GO could confine the polysulfides' dissolution through chemical absorption by the functional groups on GO layers. Therefore, the resulting S/GO/MWNT composite exhibits good rate capability and highly stable specific discharge capacity of 773 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C.

J	Li, NW; Yin, YX; Guo, YG				Li, Nian-Wu; Yin, Ya-Xia; Guo, Yu-Guo			Three-dimensional sandwich-type graphene@microporous carbon architecture for lithium-sulfur batteries	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							CATHODE MATERIALS; ACTIVATED CARBON; SURFACE-AREA; FIBER CLOTH; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; SCAFFOLDS; CAPACITY	The commercial applications of lithium-sulfur batteries are hindered by several issues including the poor electronic/ionic conductivity of sulfur and discharge products, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides in organic electrolytes, and the volume change during charge/discharge processes. In this study, a three-dimensional (3-D) sandwich-type graphene@microporous carbon (G@MC) architecture with large pore volume (2.65 cm(3) g(-1)) and ultrahigh surface area (3374 m(2) g(-1)) was designed to encapsulate sulfur and polysulfides in the hierarchical microporous structure. The G@MC materials with a lot of sp(2) hybrid carbon atoms can provide 3-D electron transfer pathways for sulfur and discharge products. Furthermore, the G@MC materials with the novel hierarchical structure can absorb a lot of polysulfides and restrain the polysulfide diffusion, and provide adequate nanospace for sulfur expansion ensuring the structural integrity during the cycling. Thus, the optimized G@MC-S nanocomposite with high sulfur loading (75.4 wt%) retains a discharge capacity of 541.3 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C. This design strategy is simple and broadly applicable, providing new opportunities for materials design that can be extended to various electrode materials.

The prepared PCNFs-CNTs-S composite are regarded as cathode for lithium -sulfur battery. The tailored porous structure and CNTs in the composite facilitate construction of a high electrical conductive pathway and store more S/polysulfides, and the dissoluble loss of intermediate S species in electrolyte can also be restrained because of acidized PVAbased porous carbon nanofibers. Meanwhile, the porous strcucture and CNTs can effectively alleviate volume changes in battery cycling process. Moreover, the presence of LiNO3 in electrolyte helps the electrochemical oxidation of Li2S and LiNO3-derived surface film effectively suppresses the migration of soluble polysulfide to the Li anode surface. Therefore, the obtained PCNFs-CNTs-S cathode exhibits excellent performance in Li-S battery with a high initial discharge capacity as high as 1302.9 mAh g(-1) and super stable capacity retention with 809.1 mAh g(-1), after 300 cycles at the current density of 837.5 mA g(-1) (0.5 C). And the rate capability of PCNFs-CNTs-S electrode is much better than those of CNTs-S and PCNFs-S electrodes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Indeed, they have gained much attention in both academia and industry due to their high theoretical energy density. Although significant progress has been achieved in the field of academia, the same thing cannot be stated for the commercial production of Li-S batteries. This is evidenced by the fact that only a few studies have demonstrated a pouch-cell approach. Thus, it is important to realize the significant gap between academic research and the real-world production of lithium-sulfur cells. In this perspective, we discuss the issues and challenges behind the large-scale production of Li-S batteries; moreover, we highlight the recent advances in the development of lithium-sulfur pouch cells that are achieved either by polysulfide regulation or by anode modification. We hope that this review will attract more attention to the development of lithium-sulfur pouch cells to overcome the practical hurdles of large-scale production. (c) 2022 Author(s).

Enhancing the catalytic activity of the sulfur host by a rational structural design is the key to address these issues. Herein, for the first time, concave-nanocubic (CNC) nickel-platinum (Ni-Pt) alloys bounded by high-index facets (HIFs) are introduced as the core catalyst of sulfur for Li-S batteries. It is demonstrated that the CNC Ni-Pt alloy crystallites dispersed uniformly on graphene exhibit a high electrochemical activity to drive the conversion from intermediate lithium polysulfides to solid discharged products. Benefiting from the accelerated redox kinetics by HIFs, the cathode delivers a low capacity damping of 0.025% per cycle for 1000 cycles at 1 C rate. In particular, a high reversible capacity of 664.9 mAh g(-cathode)(-1) de with cathode as active material can be achieved with high sulfur loading (8.8 mg cm(-2)) and low electrolyte usage (5 mu L mg(s)(-1)). This work focuses on improving the catalytic activity of sulfur hosts by modulating the exposed facets of core catalyst and provides a new path for the structure optimizing of host materials in Li-S batteries.

J	Zhang, L; Ling, M; Feng, J; Liu, G; Guo, JH				Zhang, Liang; Ling, Min; Feng, Jun; Liu, Gao; Guo, Jinghua			Effective electrostatic confinement of polysulfides in lithium/sulfur batteries by a functional binder	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Lithium sulfur batteries; Energy storage; In-situ and operando; Polymer binder; Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy; X-ray absorption spectroscopy	SULFUR BATTERIES; CARBON NANOTUBES; LI-ION; GRAPHENE; CATHODES; OXIDE; SPECIATION; CELLS	Lithium/sulfur (Li/S) batteries have been recognized as one of the most promising substitutes for current energy-storage systems due to their high-energy density and low cost. However, the high solubility of intermediate products (i.e., lithium polysulfides) and the resultant shuttle effect lead to a rapid capacity fading along with a low Coulombic efficiency, which hinders the practical application of Li/S batteries. Herein, polyethylenimine (PEI) polymer is applied as a polar binder in Li/S batteries to address above issues. The sulfur cathode with a high sulfur loading density of 8.6 mg/cm(2) coated by an ultrathin PEI layer (similar to 6.9 nm) shows a high initial areal capacity of up to 9.7 mAh/cm(2). The capacity is still maintained at 6.4 mAh/cm(2) after 50 cycles, which is comparable to that of commercial Li-ion batteries. The excellent cycling performance is attributed to the presence of abundant amino groups in PEI polymer, which can strongly bond with the intermediate lithium polysulfides through electrostatic force and therefore suppress the shuttle effect, as revealed by in situ/operando ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and S K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our effective strategy of immobilizing lithium polysulfides by electrostatic force through a functional binder should be of great significance for the practical application of Li/S batteries.

Coral-like CoP composites with interconnected pore channels were synthesized via precipitation and phosphorization and were used as the host materials for sulfur (CoP@S). The developed unique architecture possesses the ability to both physically confine polysulfides and chemically bind these species inside the host surface, efficient pathways to facilitate electron/ion transportation, good structural durability to buffer the volume variation of sulfur, and has an elastic protecting shell layer to block the soluble of polysulfides.

In this work, Fe-functionalized mesoporous carbonaceous microspheres with high conductivity and intensive chemical adsorption for polar polysulfide species (LiPSs) were successfully synthesized through economical, scalable solvothermal process and pyrolyzing method. Carbon microspheres with Fe/Fe3C components (denoted as CMS900) exhibit high conductivity and significantly enhance the electrochemical reaction kinetics despite 81 wt% sulfur loading. Furthermore, the proper amount surface oxygenic functional groups effectively immobilize sulfur via strong chemical entrapment and suppress the dissolution of LiPSs intermediates during cycling. The CMS900@S has demonstrated a high initial discharge capacity of 1269 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, over 200 cycles with the lowest average capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle, which can be treated as an alternative cathode material for LSBs with impressive electrochemical performance.

On this basis, a molybdenum nitride (MoN) microrod was fabricated using the one-pot ammoniation strategy of metal-oxide template. After the sulfur-melting permeation, rod-like architecture, which was assembled by confining the sulfur in a porous MoN microrod (MoN-S), was successfully achieved. When used as a cathode material for Li-S batteries, the as-prepared MoN-S could deliver an initial discharge capacity of as high as 1315 mAh g(-1) and maintain a reversible capacity of 902 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles when a high areal loading of 3.1 mg cm(-2) was applied. Such outstanding electrochemical performance was mainly attributed to the advantageous surface characteristic and unique chemical properties of the MoN microrod, which assured rapid electron transferability, effective sulfur-content utilization, and strong chemical-binding and catalytic effects on the soluble polysulfide.

However, the electrical insulating properties of CNF inhibit its application in host materials of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, the influence of the CNF with different charge states (positively or negatively charged CNF) and delaminated-MXene (d-MXene) composite materials on the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries was investigated. Two different types of cellulose nanofibers (TEMPO-mediated oxidation cellulose nanofiber and cationic cellulose nanofiber) were combined with d-MXene through the directional assembly of ice templates to prepare d-MXene/TEMPO-mediated oxidation cellulose nanofiber (MT) and d-MXene/cationic cellulose nanofiber (MC) composite aerogels, respectively. As a result, MT-4 aerogel as the cathode for lithium-sulfur battery shows excellent rate performance (capacity of 848.1 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 2 C), MC-6 aerogel cathode exhibits ultra-high capacity (1573.7 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C), and excellent long-term cycling performance (capacity retention rate of 96.3% after 200 cycles). The design strategy of renewable cellulose nanofiber composite materials offers a new angle for the design of low-cost and high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Pyrolyzed pencil graphite coated cellulose paper as an interlayer: An effective approach for high-performance lithium-sulfur battery	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Pencil graphite; Cellulose filter paper; Interlayer; Polysulfide; Lithium-sulfur battery	MOLECULAR-ORBITAL METHODS; GAUSSIAN-TYPE BASIS; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; POLYSULFIDE; GRAPHENE; BORON; DESIGN; ION; ABSORPTION; SEPARATOR	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is next generation battery technology but it's commercialization is obstructed primarily due to the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, we report an effective approach using pencil coated pyrolyzed cellulose filter paper as an interlayer to suppress the LiPSs dissolution into the electrolyte and thus allowing effective utilization of active sulfur cathode. Here, the binder clay particles (mainly SiO2) of pencil graphite facilitate the adsorption of LiPSs, whereas graphite increases the electrical conductivity and acts as a physical barrier to LiPSs. To investigate further, we utilize three different grades of pencil (4B, HB, 5H) which vary in terms of clay (SiO2) composition. It is observed that the HB pencil coated interlayer has the right balance of silica and graphite, which results in an impressive initial capacity of 1352 and 995 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 0.1 and 0.5 A g(-1), respectively. The cell exhibit high cycling stability of 900 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) (3.0 C) for 350 cycles with a slow capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle. The phenomenon of LiPSs adsorption is further understood using post-cycling analysis, H-cell adsorption testing, and shuttle factor calculation for the development of commercial Li-S batteries.

The one-dimensional nanostructure of Ti4O7 nanorods (1D Ti4O7 NRs) was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The as-obtained Ti4O7 NRs, with an average diameter of 150 nm, were used as sulfur host to prepare Ti4O7 NRs/sulfur cathode for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Electrochemical measurements showed that the as-synthesized Ti4O7 NRs can improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics during the charge-discharge processes. The initial discharge capacity of the Ti4O7 NRs/sulfur cathode was 930 mAh g(-1), and the remaining capacity was 490 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C, much higher than that of acetylene black/sulfur cathode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrated Ti4O7 NRs/sulfur decreases the charge transfer resistance. Moreover, Ti4O7 NRs/sulfur composite exhibits low electrode polarization accompanied by a high lithium ion diffusion coefficient.

However, owing to poor interaction between carbon materials and solid lithium sulfides, the cycling stability is still the main issue for its application. Herein, cobalt-nickel-embedded nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanotubes (CoNi@NCNTs) with a micro/mesoporous structure and high surface area were fabricated through a facile one-step template-free carbonization method, which showed high Li2S6 adsorption ability with a sulfur content as high as 69.94%. When this sulfur incorporated CoNi@NCNTs (CoNi@NCNTs/S) was used as the cathode of LSBs, a capacity of 676.8 mA h g(-1) was delivered at 1 C in the first cycle. After 500 cycles, the CoNi@NCNTs/S electrode still remained a capacity of 486 mA h g(-1) with a retention of 71.8%, equivalent to a capacity decay as low as 0.056% per cycle, indicating good cyclic stability. This work can provide a potential strategy to develop high-performance cathode materials for LSBs through embedding metal nanoparticles into nanostructured hollow carbon materials.

However, its application has been limited by low cycling stability and rapid capacity decay due to the shuttle of lithium polysulfide (Li2Sn, n > 5). These problems can be solved using small sulfur molecules (S2-4) as the active material, while synthesis of carbon hosts with suitable pores size and narrow pore distribution to encapsulate small sulfur molecules are still challenging. Here, we report a novel nitrogen-doping microporous carbon (NDMC) sulfur host with narrow micropore unimodal size distribution centered at 0.57 nm. By accommodating small sulfur molecules (S2-4) within the subnanopores of NDMC, the formation and shuttle of soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) can be avoided. The cathode shows only a long potential plateau due to the direct conversion from S2-4 to Li2S. In carbonate-based electrolyte, the NDMC/S-2 cathode remains a stable and reversible capacity of 902 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with 100% Coulombic efficiency after 500 cycles, and capacity fading per cycle is only around 0.02%. Besides, an excellent capacity of 511.8 mAh g(-1) is achieved even at an ultrahigh rate of 10 C, demonstrating a superior rate capability performance. This NDMC/S composite also shows excellent cycling stability in ether-based electrolyte. All the above demonstrate the NDMC has great potential application in Li-S batteries.

Moreover, while S-PAN nanofiber composites are flexible, they still presents shortcomings, such as low rate capability, which is due to their semiconductor electrical conductivity. In this study, we prepared S-PAN webs with high electrical conductivity via electrospinning using conducting agents. Additionally, we analyzed the electrochemical properties of the S-PAN webs prepared using various conducting agents (acetylene black, Ketjen black, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes). The specific capacity of the S-PAN web prepared using acetylene black was 740 mAh g(-1) at the charge rate of 5 C. The excellent rate capability of S-PAN prepared using acetylene black was attributed to its low electrical resistance and low charge transfer resistance.

Although carbonaceous sulfur hosts can achieve higher sulfur content and loading, the low tap densities of carbonaceous materials lead to low volumetric energy densities, restricting practical application. Here, conductive porous laminated vanadium nitride (VN) as a carbon-free sulfur host has been successfully developed to construct high tap density, high sulfur loading, and high energy density sulfur electrodes. The laminated stacking multiscale VN featuring interconnected holes possesses high storage space for sulfur loading, achieving high sulfur loading and utilization. VN@S materials' sulfur content and tap density can achieve 80 wt % and 1.17 g cm(-3), respectively. At the sulfur loading of 1.0 mg cm(-2), the VN@S cathode reaches the reversible capacity of 790 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 200 cycles and 145.2 mAh g(-1) at 15 C after 500 cycles. Precisely, at a high sulfur loading of 12.6 mg cm(-2), the VN@S cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 518.8 mAh g(-1) (485.6 mAh cm(-3)) at 0.1 C after 100 cycles.

However, the shuttle effect, low conductivity of sulfur cathode, and sluggish kinetics are remarkable barriers preventing their realistic application. Herein, we present a facile strategy in which cobalt nitride (Co4N) nanoparticles embedded leaf-like porous carbon nanosheet arrays are grown on flexible carbon cloth as a freestanding cathode for high-performance LSBs. Co4N not only adsorbs the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) strongly, but also catalytically promotes the mutual transformation between sulfur and Li2S. Moreover, theoretical simulations reveal the strong interaction between Co4N and sulfur species. The created free-standing cathode exhibits a high capacity of 1121 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, a high rate performance (746 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 5 C relative to 1237 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), and high stable cycle performance (598 mAh g(-1) at 5 C over 500 cycles with ultralow 0.035% decay per cycle). Our method provides a new potential avenue for energy conversion and storage devices based on multi-electron redox reactions.

However, the ineffective contact among these discrete units tends to cause high lithium ions diffusion barrier and interunit resistance, thus reducing sulfur conversion kinetics and utilization. Herein, a hollow carbon skeleton (NFHC) with interconnected tubular cavity is fabricated by successfully replicating the nanostructure complementary to attapulgite fiber bundle templates. The unique interconnected structure and introduction of polar F and N sites facilitate lithium ions diffusion and inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides through chemisorption. The NFHC/S cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 675.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 500 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.05% per cycle. Its lithium ions diffusion rate is 2-3 times as that of dispersed carbon nanotubes. Therefore, NFHC/S delivers an improved capacity with 546.8 mAh g(-1) at 4 C. Further increasing the sulfur loading to 4.7 mg cm(-2), the NFHC/S cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 530.0 mAh g(-1) with a low E/S ratio of 6 mL mg(-1) after 300 cyles. This work provides new insights into the structural optimization of hollow functional materials. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, a new bifunctional cathode substrate configured with boron-carbide nanowires in situ grown on carbon nanofibers (B4C@CNF) is established through a facile catalyst-assisted process. The B4C nanowires acting as chemical-anchoring centers provide strong polysulfide adsorptivity, as validated by experimental data and first-principle calculations. Meanwhile, the catalytic effect of B4C also accelerates the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion, contributing to enhanced rate capability. As a result, a remarkable capacity retention of 80% after 500 cycles as well as stable cyclability at 4C rate is accomplished with the cells employing B4C@CNF as a cathode substrate for sulfur. Moreover, the B4C@CNF substrate enables the cathode to achieve both high sulfur content (70 wt%) and sulfur loading (10.3 mg cm(-2)), delivering a superb areal capacity of 9 mAh cm(-2). Additionally, Li-S pouch cells fabricated with the B4C@CNF substrate are able to host a high sulfur mass of 200 mg per cathode and deliver a high discharge capacity of 125 mAh after 50 cycles.

Nevertheless, the dissolution of polysulfides results in their poor cycle stability, which is the major issue in practical use. To overcome the challenge, we report a new strategy by employing a redox-active covalent organic framework as the separator in lithium-sulfur batteries. The one-dimensional pore channels of the covalent organic framework provide a fast transport pathway for the lithium ion. And the pyridine units of the framework not only enhance the chemical adsorption of sulfur but also catalyze the charge and discharge processes. By virtue of these features, the specific capacity at 0.2 C is 977 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, which is 5.2 times higher than that of the pristine separator-based battery. Additionally, the specific capacity achieves 826 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 250 cycles.

Hollow carbon nanofiber@polydopamine (HCNF@PDA) micro-nano structure hybrid is first prepared by an in-situ polymerization dopamine monomer decorating on the surface of HCNFs and then elemental sulfur is infiltrated into the HCNF@PDA hybrid nanostructure by thermal treatment. The obtained HCNF@PDA-S composite shows the micro-nano structure based on the micron-sized hollow carbon nanofiber in length and nano-sized polydopamine grafted on the outer surfaces of the HCNFs with homogeneously distribution of sulfur. Compared with the HCNF-S composite, HCNF@PDA-S composite with a high sulfur content of approximately 80 wt% exhibits better electrochemical performance, which delivers initial discharge capacity of 800 mAh g(-1) and maintains 530 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C rate. The enhancements of electrochemical performances may be attributed to the unique micro-nano hybrid structure based on HCNFs and PDA coating layer, in which the micro-sized HCNFs offer the electronic conductivity and provide a firm porous network of the cathode tolerating the volume expansion of sulfur cathode, and nano-sized PDA layers effectively prevent the dissolution of the polysulfides into the electrolyte.

Using an interlayer inserted between the sulfur cathode and the separator to capture and trap these soluble intermediates has been found effective in diminishing this effect. Previously, most reported interlayer membranes were synthesized in a complex and expensive process, and might not be suitable for practical cheap batteries. Herein, a facile method is reported to pyrolyze the commonly used cellulose filter paper into highly flexible and conductive carbon fiber paper. When used as an interlayer, such a carbon paper can improve the cell capacity by several folds through trapping the soluble polysulfides. The enhanced electronic conductivity of the cathode, due to the interlayer, also significantly improves the cell rate performance. In addition, it was demonstrated that such an interlayer can also effectively mitigate the self-discharge problem of the Li-S batteries. This study indicates that the cost-effective pyrolyzed cellulose paper has potential as interlayer for practical Li-S batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the sulfur electrochemistry involves multielectron redox reactions and complicated phase transformations, while the final morphology of solid-phase Li2S precipitates largely dominate the battery's performance. Herein, a triple-phase interface among electrolyte/CoSe2/G is proposed to afford strong chemisorption, high electrical conductivity, and superb electrocatalysis of polysulfide redox reactions in a working lithium-sulfur battery. The triple-phase interface effectively enhances the kinetic behaviors of soluble lithium polysulfides and regulates the uniform nucleation and controllable growth of solid Li2S precipitates at large current density. Therefore, the cell with the CoSe2/G functional separator delivers an ultrahigh rate cycle at 6.0 C with an initial capacity of 916 mAh g(-1) and a capacity retention of 459 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles, and a stable operation of high sulfur loading electrode (2.69-4.35 mg cm(-2)). This work opens up a new insight into the energy chemistry at interfaces to rationally regulate the electrochemical redox reactions, and also inspires the exploration of related energy storage and conversion systems based on multielectron redox reactions.

Polysulfide Anchoring Mechanism Revealed by Atomic Layer Deposition of V2O5 and Sulfur-Filled Carbon Nanotubes for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						atomic layer deposition; polysulfide shuttling; lithium sulfur battery; carbon nanotubes; vanadium pentoxide	ENERGY-STORAGE; POROUS SILICON; HOST MATERIALS; SURFACE; PERFORMANCE; CATHODES; ELECTRODE; CAPACITY; DESIGN; OXIDE	Despite the promise of surface engineering to address the challenge of polysulfide shuttling in sulfur-carbon composite cathodes, melt infiltration techniques limit mechanistic studies correlating engineered surfaces and polysulfide anchoring. Here, we present a controlled experimental demonstration of polysulfide anchoring using vapor phase isothermal processing to fill the interior of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) after assembly into binder-free electrodes and atomic layer deposition (ALD) coating of polar V2O5 anchoring layers on the CNT surfaces. The ultrathin submonolayer V2O5 coating on the CNT exterior surface balances the adverse effect of polysulfide shuttling with the necessity for high sulfur utilization due to binding sites near the conductive CNT surface. The sulfur loaded into the CNT interior provides a spatially separated control volume enabling high sulfur loading with direct sulfur-CNT electrical contact for efficient sulfur conversion. By controlling ALD coating thickness, high initial discharge capacity of 1209 mAh/gs at 0.1 C and exceptional cycling at 0.2 C with 87% capacity retention after 100 cycles and 73% at 450 cycles is achieved and correlated to an optimal V2O5 anchoring layer thickness. This provides experimental evidence that surface engineering approaches can be effective to overcome polysulfide shuttling by controlled design of molecular-scale building blocks for efficient binder free lithium sulfur battery cathodes.

Herein, we introduce a defect engineering strategy to construct a defected-UiO-66-NH2-4/graphene electrocatalytic membrane (D-UiO-66-NH2-4/G EM) which could accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfides in high sulfur loadings and low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio Li-S batteries. Metal-organic frameworks (UiO-66-NH2) can be directionally chemical engraved to form concave octahedra with abundant defects. According to electrocatalytic kinetics and DFT calculations studies, the D-UiO-66-NH2-4 architecture effectively provides ample sites to capture polysulfides via strong chemical affinity and effectively delivers electrocatalytic activity of polysulfide conversion. As a result, a Li-S battery with such an electrocatalytic membrane delivers a high capacity of 12.3 mAh cm(-2) (10(13) mAh g(-1)) at a sulfur loading up to 12.2 mg.S cm(-2) under a lean electrolyte condition (E/S = 5 mu L mg(-1)-sulfur) at 2.1 mA cm(-2) (0.1 C). Moreover, a prototype soft package battery also exhibits excellent cycling stability with a maintained capacity of 996 mAh g-1 upon 100 cycles.

However, the potential application as the coating layer of the separator has not been well-addressed yet. Here, we synthesized an imine-based COF, DMTA-COF, which exhibited an AB-stacking mode and had a pore size of 0.56 nm. For the first time, we applied this nanoporous COF as the coating layer of the ceramic separator; the corresponding cell gave an initial discharge capacity up to 1415 mA h/g, and 1000 mA h/g remained after 100 cycles at 0.5 degrees C. The performance is much better than that of the pristine ceramic separator and the super-P coated ceramic separator, demonstrating that the nanopores in the composite separator can effectively block the polysulfide across the separator, thus reducing the "shuttle" effect and the loss of active materials. This study provides a new design strategy for separators in lithium sulfur batteries.

However, the practical success of Li-S batteries suffers from the shuttle effect and depressed redox kinetics of polysulfides. Herein, for the first time, InOOH nanoparticles are employed as a potent catalytic additive in sulfur electrode to overcome these issues. As demonstrated by the theoretical and experimental results, the strong interactions between the InOOH nanoparticles and sulfur species enable the effective adsorption of polysulfides. More significantly, InOOH nanoparticles not only effectively expedite the reduction of sulfur during the discharge process, but also dramatically accelerate the oxidation of Li2S during the charge process, presenting the marvelous bidirectional catalytic effects. Benefited from these distinctive superiorities, the cells with InOOH nanoparticles harvest an excellent capacity retention of 69.5% over 500 cycles at 2C and a commendable discharge capacity of 891 mAh g1under a high-sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm2. The detailed investigations in this work provide a novel insight to ameliorate the Li-S electrochemistry by the bidirec-tional catalyst for high-performance Li-S batteries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we fabricated a carbon cloth (CC)-based self-supported interlayer (denoted as Co4S3/C@CC), which is covered with Co4S3-embedded porous carbon nanoarrays through a facile two-step method with cobalt-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) nanosheets as the template. The interconnected carbon network and the polar Co4S3 nanoparticles in the Co4S3/C@CC interlayer not only effectively suppress the polysulfide shuttle, but also significantly facilitate the lithium ion (Li+) conduction with a considerable Li+ transference number of 0.86. Besides, the rich interfaces between the polar Co4S3 nanoparticles and the conductive carbon substrate serve as reaction sites to accelerate the polysulfide conversion and guide the flower-like growth of Li2S, which ultimately mitigates the interlayer surface passivation and improves the sulfur utilization. Therefore, the Li-S batteries with the Co4S3/C@CC interlayer deliver an excellent rate capacity (368.7 mA h g(-1) at 10 C), a stable cycling performance (a low fading rate of 0.045% per cycle over 1400 cycles at 2.0 C), and a high initial areal capacity (4.83 mA h cm(-2) at 0.2 C under a sulfur loading of 4.6 mg cm(-2)). This work provides a perspective on the self-supported catalytic interlayer for the selective Li+ conduction and Li2S regulation toward high-performance Li-S batteries.

Tailored sulfur cathode is of significant importance for realizing high-performances. This study reports a carbon nanotube (CN)-modified polar Co(PO3)(2)/CoP nanoparticles embedded nitrogen-doped porous-shell carbon polyhedron (CNT/CPO/CPNC-1) as a sulfur host to simultaneously overcome the barriers of lithium-sulfur batteries. The shuttle effect can be significantly restrained by the physical confinement of unique porous structure and the chemical adsorption/catalysis conversion of polar Co(PO3)(2)/CoP and the heteroatom doping of nitrogen. Meanwhile, the porous-shell carbon with interconnected carbon nanotubes can simultaneously provide a conductive framework, facilitate rapid electrical transport, and enable a large inner space to buffer volume expansion. As a result, CNT/CPO/CPNC-1/S cathode demonstrates an excellent reversible capacity of 1371.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C with stable Coulombic efficiency of 98% and an outstanding cycling stability with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.048% per cycle (500 cycles at 1.0 C).

The compacted graphene/Li2S composite cathode, in addition to providing robust electrical pathways, drives Li2S metastable particles to metastable states (high-pressure polymorphs with a highly deformed mechanical state), triggering a spontaneous conversion of Li2S to S-8 in the first charging process. This direct conversion resolves the long-standing problem of excess polysulfide formation during Li2S activation. Moreover, graphene sheets, tightly encapsulating the Li2S particles, effectively confine the active material in subsequent cycles to ensure unprecedented cycling stability at a high loading density for the Li-S battery. Here we show a major breakthrough in Li-S battery technology, providing the high energy density promised by the proposed technology while ensuring the required battery lifetime. Furthermore, successful operation of a pouch-type cell employing the pelletized graphene/Li2S composite cathode with a high loading level clearly demonstrates the convenience of scaling up the proposed pelletization of Li2S or S cathodes to a large-format Li-S battery.

It is demonstrated that the Al2O3-coating layer is quite effective in reducing shuttle effect and enhancing the stability of the sulfur electrode. The initial discharge capacity of the cell with Al2O3-coated separator can reach 967 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 0.2 C. After 50th charge/discharge cycle, this cell can also deliver a reversible capacity of as high as 593.4 mAh g(-1). Significantly, the charge-transfer resistance of the electrode tends to be reducing after using Al2O3-coated separator. The improved cell performance is attributed to the porous architecture of the Al2O3-coating layer, which serves as an ion-conducting skeleton for trapping and depositing dissolved sulfur-containing active materials, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

In this work, high-porosity biochar(HPBC) was prepared by a carbonization-activation method using a high-efficiency pore-forming agent KOH. The prepared HPBC was a porous material dominated by micropores and mesopores with a specific surface area of 2500 m(2)/g, and the pore volume of 1.18 cm(3)/g. Then, nickel nanoparticles were uniformly grown on the surface of HPBC via the electroless nickel plating to form HPBC/Ni. And finally, sublimed sulfur was introduced to prepare HPBC/Ni/S composites as cathode material for lithium sulfur battery. In this structure, HPBC can served as an efficient sulfur storage material, and nickel can be used to catalyze the reaction to enhance the reaction kinetics, while the two materials can also synergistically perform physicochemical adsorption of lithium polysulfide. The results showed that the prepared HPBC/Ni/S composite electrode has a first discharge capacity of 907.3 mAh/g at a rate of 0.5C. After 200 cycles, it still maintains 610.6 mAh/g, and the single-turn attenuation rate is only 0.16%. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the practical development of LSBs is considerably impeded, owing to the shuttling effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfide. Herein, we report porous cobalt disulfide (CoS2) nanosheets vertically grown on activated cellulose-derived carbon nanofibers (CoS2/ACCF) as an excellent interlayer for LSBs. The vertically arranged two-dimensional (2D) CoS2 nanosheets maximized the reactive surface area exposed to the electrolyte. In addition, each CoS2 nanosheet has a unique porous and crystalline structure comprising numerous nanograins encapsulated by carbon, which induces excellent electrical conductivity and stability. Benefiting from its novel architecture, CoS2/ACCF provides superior high-rate performance (815 mA h g(-1) at 2C) in LSBs. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies proved that CoS2/ACCF accelerated the interfacial reaction kinetics through highly exposed active sites on vertical 2D nanosheets, resulting reversible and stable long-term cycling performance (982 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C and 580 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C). Therefore, this work suggests a new strategy to design an effective interlayer through a facile and cost-effective method for the commercialization of LSBs.

Herein, a nonflammable 3D porous framework is constructed from functional boron nitride nanosheets (f-BNNSs) supported on a scaffold of continuous functional carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) as a bifunctional host for Li-S batteries. The unique 3D porous structure with high thermal conductivity provides a well-distributed heat field with smooth and ultrafast heat-conduction channels during continuous battery operation even at a high temperature, thereby ensuring timely and effective heat transfer and avoiding the thermal runaway caused by accumulated heat and excessive local temperature. The incombustible f-BNNSs act as a physical flame-retardant barrier to prevent the occurrence and spread of combustion. In addition, the uniform electric field with low local current density inhibit the growth of Li dendrites, avoiding the excessive local temperature caused by the formation of an uneven thermal field. The abundant polar functional groups effectively suppress polysulfide shuttling, reducing the extra heat accumulation generated by severe electrode polarization. This work provides a "two-in-one" strategy for realizing high-safety batteries via a "prevention and post-treatment" method that combines thermal field regulation and flame retardancy, and thus promotes the commercial development of Li-S batteries.

Thanks to some advantages of this type of new composites including fast lithium-ion transport, lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) anchoring and multiple functional sites, the cells with S/Zr2N2O/NC-6 cathode exhibit good cycle stability (the capacity retention is 81.8% at 1C after 300 cycles) and rate capability (566.8 mAh g(-1) at 5C). More importantly, even if the sulfur loading is up to 8.16 mg cm(-2) and low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (7.79 mu L mg(-1)), the cells with S/Zr2N2O/NC-6 cathode deliver an initial area capacity of 7.2 mAh cm(-2) and the capacity also can maintain at 5.34 mAh cm(-2) after 80 cycles at 0.2C, which are much better than the commercial lithium-ion batteries. This work exhibits a MOF-derived novel material Zr2N2O/NC used as the sulfur host for the first time, which can have a guiding role in designing multifunctional materials with adsorption, ion transport and catalytic features for the high-performance lithium sulfur batteries with application potential.

The practical application is hindered, however, by low sulfur utilization and unsatisfactory capacity retention. Herein, we present a strategy for configuration of the sulfur cathode, which is composed of an integrated carbon/sulfur/carbon sandwich structure on polypropylene separator that is produced using the simple doctor-blade technique. The integrated electrode exhibits excellent flexibility and high mechanical strength. The upper and bottom carbon layers of the sandwich-structured electrode not only work as double current collectors, which effectively improve the conductivity of the electrode, but also serve as good barriers to suppress the diffusion of the polysulfide and buffer the volume expansion of the active materials, leading to suppression of the shuttle effect and low self-discharge behavior.

Here, we improve the kinetics of sulfur species by decorating Mo2C nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the host for sulfur active mass. In addition, by use of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) derived from in situ polymerization of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) to mitigate the diffusion of PSs and improve the stability of Li stripping/plating. As a result, the sulfur cathodes are endowed with enhanced initial specific capacity and suppressed dissolution of sulfur species. The cells with CNT/Mo2C/S cathodes and GPE exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. The anodes cycled with GPE show remarkably enhanced lithium plating-stripping behavior. Benefitting from the synergistic effect, LSBs with higher energy density and improved durability are obtained, demonstrating a new approach for developing high-performance quasi-solid-state Li metal batteries.

However, one main, well-known drawback of LSBs is the so-called polysulfide shuttling, where the polysulfide dissolves into organic electrolytes from sulfur host materials. Numerous studies have shown the ability of porous carbon as a sulfur host material. Porous carbon can significantly impede polysulfide shuttling and mitigate the insulating passivation layers, such as Li2S, owing to its intrinsic high electrical conductivity. This work suggests a scalable and straightforward one-step synthesis method to prepare a unique interconnected microporous and mesoporous carbon framework via salt templating with a eutectic mixture of LiI and KI at 800 degrees C in an inert atmosphere. The synthesis step used environmentally friendly water as a washing solvent to remove salt from the carbon-salt mixture. When employed as a sulfur host material, the electrode exhibited an excellent capacity of 780 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) and a sulfur loading mass of 2 mg cm(-2) with a minor capacity loss of 0.36% per cycle for 100 cycles. This synthesis method of a unique porous carbon structure could provide a new avenue for the development of an electrode with a high retention capacity and high accommodated sulfur for electrochemical energy storage applications.

J	Mao, LM; Wang, F; Mao, J				Mao, Limin; Wang, Fei; Mao, Jian			ZnO with abundant Zn vacancies assisted by reduced graphene oxides for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS			English	Article						Defect; ZnO; Li-S battery; Reduce graphene oxide; Zn vacancy	POLYSULFIDES; NANOSHEETS; COMPOSITE; NANOSPHERES; RGO	Defects engineering in electrode materials is popular in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Generally, the defects can improve the adsorption and catalytic activity for polysulfides of materials. Herein, we synthesize zinc oxide (ZnO) samples with different concentration of Zn vacancies (ZnO-1 h, ZnO-2 h, ZnO-4 h). We find that the Zn vacancies in ZnO render high catalytic activity for fast kinetics of polysulfides, while the more Zn vacancies cause the worse adsorption of ZnO. When these samples combine with reduced oxide graphene (rGO) to load sulfur as sulfur cathodes (noted ZnO-2 h/rGO/S etc.), the ZnO-2h/rGO/S cathode exhibits the optimal performance because ZnO-2 h has the best catalytic activity and modest adsorption. Under electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) of 7.5 mu L mgS(-1) , the ZnO-2 h/rGO/S cathode exhibits a higher initial capacity of 1369.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C (1C = 1672 mA g(-1)) and better rate performance than ZnO/rGO/S. The density functional theory calculations reveal the higher conductivity but lower adsorption for polysulfides of ZnO with Zn vacancies (Zn1-xO) than ZnO. Further, the stronger catalytic activity of Zn1-xO can be explained by the increase of S-S length in Li2S4 absorbed on Zn1-xO. This paper exposes that the high catalysis is predominant than the strong adsorption for choosing electrode materials.

The NSC provides for a high pore volume (0.19 cm(3) g(-1)) and large specific surface area (111.25 m(2) g(-1)). Because of the highly hierarchical porous structure of the NSC material, allowing polysulfides to remain in the carbon framework after cycling, the sulfur/NSC composite exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance.

In this work, we demonstrate the rational construction of a multifunctional sulfur host grown on carbon cloth consisting of self-supported porous VN arrays coupled with MOF-derived N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with tiny Co nanoparticles (named CC/VN/ Co@NCNTs). This unique electrode design possesses a series of advantages such as high electrical conductivity, strong physical/chemical confinement of LiPSs, favorable catalytic activity, fast reaction kinetics, effective volumetric accommodation, good mechanical stability and high sulfur loading. As expected, when evaluated as self-standing and binder-free cathode for Li-S batteries, the CC/VN/Co@NCNTs/S exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1130.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and maintains 864.1 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, along with outstanding rate performance (625.3 mAh g(-1) at 5C) and superior long-term cycling stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.063% per cycle at 1C for 500 cycles. Moreover, the CC/VN/Co@NCNTs/S delivers high reversible capacities of 847.6, 668.3, and 581.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C after 100 cycles at different high sulfur loadings of 2.8, 5.2, and 7.8 mg cm(-2), respectively. The present work might provide an effective strategy to directly construct multifunctional sulfur host materials on current collectors for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, their commercialization has been greatly hindered by their poor cycle life and severe self-discharge, which can be attributed to the polysulfides dissolution. To overcome these issues, much effort has been devoted to engineering the electrode structure and composition to improve the performance which is often expensive and laborious. In this study, an ultralight multiwall carbon nanotube/N-doped carbon quantum dot (MWCNT/NCQD)-coated separator is first designed, which is cost effective and facile. The MWCNTs/NCQDs-coated separator is then applied in Li-S batteries. The MWCNTs/NCQDs coating provides a physical shield against polysulfide shuttling and chemical adsorption of polysulfides by MWCNTs and NCQDs. The synergetic effect of MWCNTs and NCQDs enables the production of Li-S cell with a relative high initial discharge capacity of 1330.8 mA h g(-1) and excellent cyclic performance with a corresponding capacity fade rate of as low as 0.05% per cycle at 0.5 C over 1000 cycles. Excellent rate capability and anti-self-discharge behavior are also displayed. The design of MWCNTs/NCQDs-coated separator is a viable approach for successfully developing practical Li-S batteries.

J	Wang, Y; Huang, JY; Wang, L; Ye, ZZ				Wang, Yang; Huang, Jingyun; Wang, Lei; Ye, Zhizhen			A nanostructured ferroelectric lithium tantalate as polysulfide immobilizer and promoter for improved lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Lithium tantalate; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Rate performance; Cycling performance; Polysulfide shuttling; Reaction kinetics	PROMISING ANCHORING MATERIALS; HOST MATERIALS; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; COMPOSITES; ADSORPTION; SHELL; FOAM	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been considered as a promising rechargeable energy storage system owing to its high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the intermediate polysulfide dissolution into electrolyte causing infamous "shuttling effect" seriously hampers the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, we synthesize a bifunctional nanostructured LiTaO3 ferroelectric using as additive in cathode of Li-S batteries. Relevant electrochemical experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the resultant nanostructured LiTaO3 can not only alleviate polysulfide dissolution through effective chemisorption between Li-O and S-Ta interactions, but also promote the electrochemical reaction kinetics of polysulfide. When used as cathode material for Li-S batteries, the S@CNT@ LiTaO3 composite cathode exhibits excellent high rate performance and stable cycling performance with a low capacity decay rate of 0.082% at 0.5C during 450 cycles. With high sulfur loading of 5.4 mg cm(-2), the cathode can still achieve a high initial areal capacity of 4.3 mAh cm(-2) (899 mAh g(-1) in gravimetric capacity) and maintains 3.7 mAh cm(-2) (764 mAh g(-1) in gravimetric capacity) after 100 cycles. The results demonstrate that the simply prepared nano LiTaO3 is a novel polysulfide immobilizer and promoter in Li-S batteries system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we present a novel hybrid electrode with a ternary nanomaterial based on sulfur-impregnated multiwalled carbon nanotubes filled with ordered tin-monoxide nanoparticles (MWCNT-SnO/S). Using a dry plasma reduction method, a mechanically robust material is prepared as a cathode host material for lithium-sulfur batteries. The MWCNT-SnO/S electrode exhibits high conductivity, good ability to capture polysulfides, and small volume change during a repeated charge-discharge process. In situ transmission electron microscopy and ultraviolet-visible absorption results indicate that the MWCNT-SnO host efficiently suppresses volume expansion during lithiation and reduces polysulfide dissolution into the electrolyte. Furthermore, the ordered SnO nanoparticles in the MWCNTs facilitate fast ion/electron transfer during the redox reactions by acting as connective links between the walls of the MWCNTs. The MWCNT-SnO/S cathode with a high sulfur content of 70 wt.% exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1,682.4 mAh.g(-1) at 167.5 mA.g(-1) (0.1 C rate) and retains a capacity of 530.1 mAh.g(-1) at 0.5 C after 1,000 cycles with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the electrode exhibits the high capacity even at a high current rate of 20 C.

Herein, we report designing of a double hollow spherical carbon (C@C) by using RF resin coated SiO2 as an exo-template. The developed C@C/S cathode could host about 69.1 wt% of S and exhibits a high specific capacity of 1396 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C corresponding to 83.5% of S utilization. Furthermore, the cathode could sustain a current rate of 5 C (8.4 A g(-1)) and still delivers a reasonable capacity of 320 mAh g(-1) with excellent electrochemical stability at this high rate with no apparent capacity fading for 100 cycles. The present results highlight the importance of morphological pre-design for developing advanced carbon materials as Li-S cathode host.

The synthesized NbS2 flakes were characterized well with different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques and confirmed they are in 3R-NbS2 polymorph structure, which is semi-conducting in nature. Later, they were successfully deposited onto carbon cloth (CC) and tested for Li-S cell. Lithium-sulfur batteries suffer from polysulfide (PS) shuttling effects which hinder the performance of the cell. High capacity fade, slow redox kinetics, and the low cyclability of cells are just some of the many problems caused by the shuttling effect that hinder the viability of the battery. Herein, we utilized the catalytic nature of NbS2 along with the high conductivity of CC for better PS adsorption, their liquid to solid conversion, fast PS redox kinetics which substantially enhanced the overall Li-S performance.

However, the "Shuttle effect" of poly-sulfides and low sulfur utilization upon cycling are still hindering their practical applications. Herein, we report a series of marine organism-like hollow nanoarchitecture consisting of nitrogen (N) doped 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which were derived from binary Fe/Ce Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) and melamine. This nitrogen-doped 3D hollow scaffold offers large inner space (phi approximate to 200 nm) and sufficient electric conducting for insulating sulfur and provides adsorption sites for immobilizing polysulphides. The introduced double metal species enable strong chemical adsorption toward polysulfides and could facilitate the redox reaction between sulfur and polysulphides. When applied in Li-S batteries, the as-prepared materials showed a high capacity of 1241 mAh g(-1) and a stable cycling performance (1003 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles) at a current density of 0.2 C. The enhancement of electrochemical activity could be attributed to the 3D hollow architecture of the hybrid, in which the nitrogen-doping generates defects and active sites for improved interfacial adsorption. This work could inspire developing biomimetic architectures for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) freestanding framework configured with Co nanoparticles and Co-N-x codoped carbon nanotubes anchored in a carbon foam is synthesized and investigated as a new type of sulfur host. Such an architecture can serve not only as a conductive carbon networks but also as host scaffold for high sulfur-containing electrodes. The hierarchical porous structures cooperated with high density and dispersion multifunctional Co-N-x species can efficiently trap and manipulate catalytic conversion kinetics of polysulfides. Benefiting from above characteristics, the designed cathodes exhibit a high capacity (1259 mA h g(-1)) at 0.1 C and excellent cycling performance with an ultralow decay of 0.038% per cycle over 500 cycles at a high current density of 3 C. Even with a high sulfur loading (7.0 mg cm(-2)) and lean electrolyte (E/S = 5 mu L mg(-1)) operation, a high areal capacity of 4.34 mA h cm(-2) is still achieved after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. This work provides a low-cost route for preparation of freestanding cathode materials toward highly efficient lithium-sulfur batteries.

Here, we perform periodic density functional theory calculations to reveal the potential of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet (g-C3N4) and its heteroatoms (B, O, P and S) doped systems, to be used as chemical anchoring materials for LiPSs. From the calculations, the LiPSs are stabilized on g-C3N4 materials via lithium bond interaction between Li of LiPSs and N of g-C3N4. With the introduction of dopant atoms, tuning possibility of the LiPSs adsorption energies is observed. The interaction of LiPSs on B- and P-doped g-C3N4 provide optimum adsorption energies which is appropriate for LSBs anchoring. However, the O- and S-doped g-C3N4 have a weak adsorption which is similar to the pristine one. The anchoring performance of g-C3N4 materials for suppressing LiPSs in dissolving into the electrolytes is also highlighted by comparing their adsorption on g-C3N4 materials and on various electrolytic clusters. The adsorption energies of LiPSs on B- and P-doped g-C3N4 are found to be stronger than those on electrolytes. The electron transfers and van der Waals interaction are found to play significant roles for the LiPSs adsorption. The results provide the fundamental understanding g-C3N4 surface tuning by doping heteroatoms for the suppression materials to reduce the shuttle effect, which will be beneficial for the advanced LSBs development.

Elucidating the anchoring effect has important implications for the MOFs design. The first-principles calculation shows that the adsorption of poly sulfides intermediates occurs through the Li-heteroatom (N/O) bonding with the capacity order of MOF-5 > ZIF-8 > ZIF-67. The electronegativity of Zn in ZIF-8 is lower than that of Co in ZIF-67, leading to a higher charge density of N atoms in the ligand, which results in greater adsorption. The electronegativity of O in the ligand of MOF-5 is higher than that of N in ZIF-8, which contributes to closer Li-O interaction. Besides, MOF-5 provides enough space for both Li atoms to bond with O atoms of the ligand. Accordingly, MOFs with low electronegativity metal center, high electronegativity ligand heteroatom, and sufficient ligand framework space would have great anchoring effect.

The effects of nitrogen and sulfur co-doping and the addition of formaldehyde on the structure and properties of these novel materials were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. With high levels of sulfur doping, the nitrogen/sulfur co-doped ordered carbon nanoarrays (NS-OCNA/S) were found to possess hierarchical pores and a high pore volume. The NS-OCNA/S exhibited good electrical conductivity, excellent discharge capacity and cycling performance. When the NS-OCNA/S was used in Li-S batteries it was found that the charge capacity of the cell decayed from 914 to 739 mAh g(-1), with a capacity retention 81% over 600 cycles at 2 C. This successful research effort has identified new, high-performance materials derived from bio-resources for use in Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates and the slow electrochemical kinetics have a severe passive effect on the cycling stability and rate performance. A Co3W3C@C composite was prepared through a simple one-pot pyrolysis method and used as a modifying layer on a commercial separator. The obtained modified separator not only prevented the shuttle effect through both strong chemical interaction and a physical barrier toward polysulfides, but also acted as a catalytic membrane to catalyze the electrochemical redox of active sulfur species. By employing the coated separator, the cathode with 60 wt % sulfur delivered a high initial capacity of 1345 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 670 mAh g(-1) even at 7 A g(-1), and outstanding cycle performance with a low decay rate of 0.06 % per cycle and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.3 % within 500 cycles at 1 A g(-1). Even at a sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-1), a high initial capacity of 869 mAh g(-1) and 632 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 A g(-1) were obtained. The results demonstrate the advantages of Co-W bimetallic carbide in preventing the shuttle effect and promoting the redox kinetics for high performance Li-S batteries.

In this study, a novel conjugated micro/mesoporous polymer (ST-CMP) is developed by rational design of the organic condensation reaction of squaric acid and 1,3,5-Tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene, which can uniformly wrap onto carbon nanotube (CNT) as assembled nanotentacle, serving as the highly efficient sulfur electrocatalyst for Li-S batteries. In this composite, the cross-linked CNT conductive network significantly improves the electron transfer and reaction kinetics of active materials. In addition, the ST-CMP assembled nanotentacle prevents the restacking or aggregation of ST-CMP, favoring the exposure of active sites on ST-CMP for efficient LiPSs chemical interaction. The abundant polymeric zwitterions in ST-CMP with uniformly distributed positively polarized N atoms and negatively polarized O atoms can not only empower comprehensive regulation of LiPSs adsorption, but also simultaneously allow accelerated LiPSs catalytic conversion, rendering admirable redox reaction kinetics. With these merits, the obtained S/ST-CMP@CNT composites exhibit a high initial specific capacity of 1307 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.047% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C, exhibiting great potential in developing Li-S batteries with decent performance.

However, the safety problem severely restricts the practical application of Li-S batteries because of the possible occurrence of thermal runaway caused by battery short circuits and combustible components, particularly under bending conditions. The development of advanced separators that can suppress lithium dendrite growth and are incombustible is the key to improving the safety of flexible Li-S batteries. In this work, a nonflammable multifunctional Janus separator with self-extinguishing capability, high thermal stability, high thermal conductivity, good electrolyte infiltration, uniform lithium deposition, and efficient polysulfide shuttling inhibition, is proposed. The separator is composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) membrane as well as functional layers of boron nitride (BN) for suppressing lithium dendrite growth and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for accelerating the sulfur convention kinetics. As a result, the Li-S battery with a sulfur mass loading of 2.7 mg cm(-2) delivers a specific capacity of 916.8 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C and maintains a stable performance during intermittent thermal shock. Moreover, the Li-S pouch cell with a sulfur mass loading of 8 mg exhibits a high capacity of 6.3 mA h under bending conditions.

However, their application is still impeded by the inherent sluggish kinetics and solubility of intermediate products (i.e., polysulfides) of the sulfur cathode. Herein, graphene-supported Ni nanoparticles with a carbon coating are fabricated by directly carbonizing a metal-organic framework/graphene oxide composite, which is then dispersed on a commercial glass fiber membrane to form a separator with electrocatalytic activity. In situ analysis and electrochemical investigation demonstrate that this modified separator can effectively suppress the shuttle effect and regulate the catalytic conversion of intercepted polysulfides, which is also confirmed by density functional theory calculations. It is found that Ni-C sites can chemically interact with polysulfides and stabilize the radical S-3(center dot-) through Ni-S bonds to enable fast dynamic equilibrium with S-6(2-), while Ni nanoparticles reduce the oxidation barrier of Li2S and accelerate ion/electron transport. As a result, the corresponding lithium-sulfur battery shows a high cycle stability (88% capacity retention over 100 cycles) even with a high sulfur mass loading of 8 mg cm(-2) and lean electrolyte (6.25 mu L mg(-1)). Surprisingly, benefitting from the improved kinetics, the battery can work well at -50 degrees C, which is rarely achieved by conventional Li-S batteries.

Dissolution of lithium polysulfide intermediates in conventional Li-S electrolytes is known as one of the key technical barriers to the development of Li-S, because it promotes redistribution and irreversible deposition of Li2S, and also forces large amounts of electrolyte to be used, shortening cycling life and driving down cell energy density. Recently, dimethyl disulfide as a functional co-solvent has been demonstrated to show an alternate electrochemical reaction pathway for sulfur cathodes by the formation of dimethyl polysulfides and lithium organosulfides as intermediates and reduction products. In this work, comprehensive studies show that this new pathway not only provides high capacity but also enables excellent capacity retention through a built-in automatic discharge shutoff mechanism by tuning carbon/sulfur ratio in sulfur cathodes to reduce unfavorable Li2S formation. Furthermore, this new electrolyte system is also found to enable high capacity of high-sulfur-loading cathodes with low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios, such as a stable specific capacity of around 1000 mAh g(-1) using a low electrolyte amount (i.e, E/S ratio of 5 mL g(-1)) and high sulfur -loading (4 mg cm(-2)) cathodes. This electrolyte system almost doubles the capacity obtained with conventional electrolytes under the same harsh conditions. These results highlight the practical potential of this electrolyte system to enable high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

However, severe capacity fading due to volume breath and polysulfide dissolution greatly hinders the commercialization of Li-S battery. As an attempt to solve the problem, a hollow MnO2 spheres/porous reduced graphene oxide/S (MnO2/RGO/S) composite was synthesized by an one-step hydrothermal method, of which the hollow MnO2 spheres can effectively restrains the volume expansion/contraction of S8 and the dissolution of polysulfides during the charge-discharge processes. Furthermore, 3D RGO with high electronic conductivity can facilitates a fast electronic transfer. The initial specific capacity of the MnO2/RGO/S composite is 1202.0 mAh g(-1) and remains 577.0 mAh g(-1) with the coulombic efficiency of 93.2% at 0.2C after 200 cycles, and the capacity retention remains higher than 61.4% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles at 1C, indicating a synergistic effect of hollow MnO2 spheres and conducive 3D RGO.

Whereas, the severe shuttling and low redox reaction kinetics of polysulfides (LiPSs) cause the rapid loss of active material, poor rate performance and severe self-discharge. To address above issues, herein, for the first time, we reported the layered LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) particles as a host to trap LiPSs and accelerate LiPSs conversion simultaneously. We theoretically elucidate and experimentally verify the strong adsorption for Li2S6 through the NCA (104), (003) and (110) crystal planes by the formation of the strong Li-O and Co-S bonds to capture and immobilize LiPSs solidly. At the same time, the intrinsic catalytic effects of NCA with polar surface as an accelerator can propel the LiPSs redox reactions. In addition, NCA can effectively improve static stability of Li-S batteries and suppress their self-discharge behavior. Therefore, the LiS cells with NCA achieved a high discharge capacity of 755.4 mA h g(-1) with a low capacity decay rate of 0.02%/ cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C. This work opens up a convenient and effective way to substantially enhance the capability of Li-S batteries for their practical application.

We studied two activation methods for such carbons, namely annealing in ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2). We found that both activation environments drastically increased the specific surface area and establish a micro- and mesoporous pore structure. Treatment with NH3 also introduced nitrogen groups, which increased the initial specific capacity. The non-activated carbon yielded carbon/sulfur cathodes with an initial capacity of similar to 900 mAh/g(sulfur) (150 mAh/g(sulfur) after 100 cycles). The initial capacity was increased to 1300 mAh/g(sulfur) for the NH3 activated sample but with poor cycling stability. Enhanced performance stability was found for the CO2 treated sample with an initial capacity of 1100 mAh/g(sulfur) (700 mAh/g(sulfur) after 100 cycles).

Herein, we developed a one-pot carbothermal reduction method to synthesize new CoO nanoparticles decorated Co9S8(Co9S8/CoO) heterostructures with well-defined interfaces, in which CoO shows strong adsorption function and Co9S8 has significant electrocatalysis function. The Co9S8/CoO heterostructures with rationally structural design can not only improve the chemical capturing between CoO and LiPSs but also facilitate the electrocatalytic activity of Co9S8 involving the reaction from soluable LiPSs to insoluble Li2S2 and subsequent solid-solid reaction from Li2S2 to Li2S. The synergistic adsorption-electrocatalysis function is verified by both theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterizations. The Li-S cell with the Co9S8/CoO-Graphene coated separator exhibits a coulombic efficiency of approximately 100% and delivers a specific capacity of 925 mA h g(-1) with a fade rate of 0.049% per cycle over 1000 cycles under a high S loading (2.5 mg cm(-2)). This work provides an emerging view on the design of heterostructures with synergistic adsorption and electrocatalysis function for application in Li-S batteries and catalysis fields.

However, the low adsorption strength between pure Ti3C2Tx and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) causes inferior capacity. Surface modification is a promising methode to improve LiPSs adsorption strength of Ti3C2Tx. Herein, we report a fast method for rational surface engineering of Ti3C2Tx in this paper. One-step plasma treatment strategy is applied to prepare nitrogen-doped Ti3C2Tx (Ti3C2Tx-N) in the first time. SEM and EDS mapping images show that the homogenous nitrogen doped on Ti3C2Tx. Due to the strong interaction between nitrogen in Ti3C2Tx with LiPSs along with high electronical conductivity, the S/MXene-N composite demonstrates excellent electrochemical performances, including high initial reversible capacity (1281.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C) and high cycling stability (420.3 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C after 1000 cycles). Overall this work offers a simple surface engineering strategy to manipulate Ti3C2Tx towards high-performance LSBs' cathodes host.

In this paper we report on a dihydrogen phosphate modified CM (PCM-650) prepared from luffa sponge (luffa acutangula) by phosphoric acid treatment. The phosphoric acid not only increases the surface area of the PCM-650, but also introduces dihydrogen phosphate onto PCM-650 (2.28 at% P). Sulfur impregnated (63.6 wt%) PCM-650/S, in comparison with samples with less dihydrogen phosphate LPCM-650/S, shows a significant performance improvement. XPS analysis is conducted for sulfur at different stages, including sulfur (undischarged), polysulfides (discharge to 2.1 V) and short chain sulfides (discharge to 1.7 V). The results consistently show chemical shifts for S-2p in PCM-650, suggesting an enhanced adsorption effect. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to clarify the molecular binding: carbon/sulfur (0.86 eV), carbon/Li2S (0.3 eV), CH3-O-PO3H2/sulfur (1.24 eV), and CH3-O-PO3H2/Li2S (1.81 eV). It shows that dihydrogen phosphate group can significantly enhance the binding with sulfur and sulfide, consistent with XPS results. Consequently a CM functionalised with dihydrogen phosphate shows great potential as the sulfur host in a Li-S battery.

Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving sulfur cathodes. However, issues associated with Li anodes, such as low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and growth of Li dendrites, remain unsolved due to unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lead to poor capacity retention and a short cycling life of Li-S batteries. In this work, we demonstrate a facile and effective approach to fabricate a flexible and robust hybrid SEI layer through co deposition of aromatic-based organosulfides and inorganic Li salts using poly(sulfur-random-1,3-diisopropenylbenzene) as an additive in an electrolyte. The aromatic-based organic components with planar backbone conformation and pi-pi interaction in the SEI layers can improve the toughness and flexibility to promote stable and high efficient Li deposition/dissolution. The as-formed durable SEI layer can inhibit dendritic Li growth, enhance Li deposition/dissolution CE (99.1% over 420 cycles), and in turn enable Li-S batteries with good cycling stability (1000 cycles) and slow capacity decay. This work demonstrates a route to address the issues associated with Li metal anodes and promote the development of high-energy rechargeable Li metal batteries.

In this work, a triphasic composite of LDH/sulfur/rGO (LDH: layered double hydroxide, rGO: reduced graphene oxide) with a crepe cake like structure is designed and fabricated as a positive electrode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. Sulfur nanoparticles are embedded in the interlayer space of the composite and thus are well protected physically via three-dimensional wrapping and chemically via strong interaction of LDH nanoflakes with lithium polysulfides, such as ionic bonds and S center dot center dot center dot H hydrogen bonds. In addition, the flexible lamellar structure of the composite with soft graphene layers can tolerate the volume expansion of sulfur during lithiation as well as facilitate ionic permeability and electron transport, which is favorable for the redox reactions of polysulfide. The present work sheds light on the future development and industrialization of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, a Ti3C2Tx MXene-carbon nanocage-sulfur (MXene/CNC/S) cathode is synthesized by a simple process with high conductivity and outstanding performance in Li-S batteries. The cathode with an unusually high sulfur content of 80% demonstrates an eminent initial specific capacity of 1275.5 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1 degrees C and retains 823.8 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles, showing a high retention rate of 64.6%. Besides, it exhibits a great conductive feature for rate performance, delivering 630.5 mAh.g(-1) capacity when the current rises to 4 degrees C. In this composition electrode, the excellent electrochemical performance indicates that MXene can effectively adsorb polysulfides to help batteries achieve long-term cyclic performance. On the other hand, the introduction of CNC strongly improves the specific surface area of the cathode and constructs a high conductive network to reduce the stacking of MXene, thus exhibiting better rate performance and increasing utilization of sulfur. Our work holds future technological significance as it could accelerate progress towards lithium-sulfur batteries with high sulfur content and less pricy conductive materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, dissolution and shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) intermediates have severely affected their overall electrochemical properties and limited their practical application. Designing polar cathode hosts that can effectively bind LiPSs and simultaneously promote their redox conversion is crucial for realizing high-performance LSBs. Herein, we report bronze TiO2 (TiO2-B) nanosheets (similar to 5 nm in thickness) chemically bonded with carbon as a novel multifunctional cathode host for advanced LSBs. Experimental observation and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the TiO2-B with exposed (100) plane and Ti3+ ions exhibited high chemical affinity toward polysulfides and effectively confined them at surface. Meantime, Ti3+ ions and interface coupling with carbon promoted electronic conductivity of the composite cathode, leading to enhanced redox conversion kinetics of LiPSs during charge/discharge. Consequently, the as-assembled TiO2-B/S cathode manifested high capacity (1165 mAh/g at 0.2 degrees C), excellent rate capability (244 mAh/g at 5 degrees C) and outstanding cyclability (572 mAh/g over 500 cycles at 0.2 degrees C). This work sheds insights on rational design and fabrication of novel functional electrode materials for beyond Li-ion batteries.

The NGF possesses highly conductive and interconnected mesoporous network. Particularly nitrogen-doping provided strong polysulfide immobilization ability, significantly suppressing the shuttle effect. The NGF was directly used as binder-free electrode which delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 987 mA h g(-1) and maintains at 819mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, corresponding to 82.9% capacity retention. Specifically, even at high current density of 2 C, it still possesses a good long life cycle performance (from 633.8mA h g(-1) to 440.3mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles, with ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.061% per cycle). 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (7Li NMR) suggested strong interaction between NGF and polysulfide. Moreover, Xray photoelectron spectroscopy and density function theory calculation further revealed the strong interaction mostly ascribed to chemisorption and physisorption of polysulfide by pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen, respectively. As we know this method-based NGF as binder free electrode was first reported, which provided an effective strategy for developing high-performance Li/S batteries. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Among various interlayer materials, carbon materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes are particularly appealing because of their high electrical conductivity. Here, a new flexible carbon membrane interlayer consisting of graphene oxide (GO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed by a facile vacuum filtration approach to trap the lithium polysulfides in the sulfur electrode. When the GO/CNT bilayer membrane is used as an interlayer between the sulfur electrode and separator (glass fiber), the Li-S battery delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1591.56 mAh g(-1) and maintains a capacity of about 1000mAhg(-1) over 50 cycles at 0.2C with a low potential difference of 150mV. This reflects higher electrochemical performance than a GO or CNT monolayer unilaterally. This is attributed to the hydrophilic functional group of the GO layer strongly adsorbing lithium polysulfides dissolved in liquid electrolyte and the CNT layer enhancing the ion conductivity.

In this work, we proposed a sulfur and nitrogen co-doped strategy to increase interaction between the lithium sulfides and host. Herein, free-standing S and N dually doped porous carbon nanofibers (donated as SN-PCNF) are prepared and serve as efficient sulfur host materials. Benefitting from the S and N co-doped strategy, the chemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides increases, thus the free-standing SN-PCNF@S cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1133 mA h.g(-1) with 80% sulfur loading. Furthermore, the DFT calculations reveals the stronger polysulfide binding with nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbons than that with nodoped or nitrogen single-doped carbons.

However, the severe shutting of polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. To solve these problems, MOF (ZIF-67) derived in-situ N-doped carbon nanocage embedded with CoP (CoP-HNC) as an efficient sulfur host for advanced Li-S batteries is proposed here. With the abundant porosity and cavity, hollow polar heteroatom N-doped carbon architecture can effectively alleviate volume expansion, buffer electrolyte and trap polysulfides. More importantly, the embedded polar CoP nanoparticles acted as an effective electrocatalyst not only anchor polysulfide intermediates, but also promote the redox kinetics toward polysulfides conversion remarkably, which is clearly proved by experimental results and DFT calculations. Benefiting from above advantages, Li-S batteries assembled with CoP-HNC electrode achieve a significantly enhanced sulfur utilization (about 800 mAh g-1 at 5 C), improved cycling stability and ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.02% per cycle after 1000 cycles. Even at high sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm-2, the S/CoP-HNC electrode still delivers a high initial capacity of 866 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C. This work has guiding synergistically combining desired design and electrocatalysis in sulfur cathode for Li-S batteries.

However, electrodes with high sulfur loading usually exhibit unsatisfactory mechanical flexibility and inferior electrochemical stability. Herein, we report a high sulfur loading multilayer electrode with good flexibility, which is constructed using reduced graphene oxide and conductive polymer film by a simple multilayer coating method. The prepared electrode possesses high flexibility and electrochemical performance under sulfur loading of 6.1 mg cm(-2) and sulfur content of 60% in the entire electrode. The electrode can even release a reversible capacity of 559 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at a rate current density of 2 C, corresponding to a capacity decay rate of 0.057% per cycle. The stable electrochemical properties are due to the fact that conductive polymer films and reduced graphene oxide sheets could effectively inhibit the dissolution and diffusion of the polysulfide compounds.

As such, the development of a new class of energy storage systems is a particular challenge, since future systems will require a single device to provide both a high gravimetric energy and a high power density. In this context, we herein report the design of novel lithium-sulfur capacitors. The resulting asymmetric systems exhibited energy densities of 23.9-236.4 Wh kg(-1) and power densities of 72.2-4097.3 W kg(-1), which are the highest reported values for an asymmetric system to date. This approach involved the use of a prelithiated anode and a hybrid cathode material exhibiting anion adsorption-desorption in addition to the electrochemical reduction and oxidation of sulfur at almost identical rates. This novel strategy yielded both high energy and power densities, and therefore establishes a new benchmark for hybrid systems.

However, the trade-off between effective suppression of the shuttle effect and fast redox reaction kinetics is inevitable for separator-based Li-S batteries. Herein, via a self-confined solid-conversion process, we develop a polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)-threaded well-intergrown HKUST-1 (Cu-3(BTC)(2)) (BTC: 1,3,5-benzene-tricarboxylic acid)-coated Celgard separator (PSS@HKUST-1/Celgard, PHC) for high-performance Li-S batteries. The PHC membrane favors the interception and accommodation of long-chain PS. Notably, enormous sulfonate groups of the three-dimensional PSS networks in PSS@HKUST-1 membrane significantly facilitate lithium-ion transport, which guarantee fast redox kinetics. The PHC separator demonstrates efficient inhibition of PS (i.e., 4 orders of magnitude lower in PS permeation rate) with fast Li+ transportation (i.e., 71% higher in ionic conductivity) than the Celgard separator. When applying the PHC membrane in Li-S batteries with conventional sulfur/super P carbon cathode, highly reversible capacity with an average fading rate of 0.05% per cycle is maintained for 500 cycles at 0.5 C, excellent rate performance up to 5 C, and high areal capacity over 7 mA h cm(-2) are also achieved. This work paves a new way for addressing the trade-off between suppressing the PS shuttle effect and fast kinetic reaction for separator-based Li-S batteries.

However, the uncontrollable deposition of electronic and ionic insulative Li2S always passivates the catalyst surface for the continuous LiPS conversion. Herein, we propose an effective method to regulate Li2S deposition to avoid the catalyst surface passivation by introducing grain boundaries (GBs) in the catalyst. Hollow microspheres composed of MoN-Mo2N heterostructure with abundant and highly accessible GBs were prepared as the models. The results show GBs act as the two-dimensional nucleation sites, guiding the fast nucleation and three-dimensional deposition of Li2S around them, avoiding the formation of dense Li2S coating on their surface. Thus, the high capacity Li2S deposition with enhanced conversion kinetics was achieved. The interlayer composed of the above catalyst and carbon nanotube effectively suppresses the shuttling of LiPSs and promotes their fast conversion, leading to a low capacity decay of 0.049% per cycle at 1 C for 800 cycles for the assembled battery. With a higher sulfur loading of 4.7 mg cm-2 under 0.5 C, high capacity retention of 77.2% after 200 cycles could also be achieved.

A study of different microspace-confined sulfur will not only promote the advancement of Li-S batteries but also arouse a wide interest in sulfur chemistry and related applications. Herein, we choose two-dimensional (2D) graphene interlayer as host and construct 2D space-confined sulfur model systems by simple intercalation chemistry of graphite oxide. Two routes, including solvothermal method and interlamellar reaction approach, are developed, and sulfur can be easily intercalated into sub-nanometer-sized graphene interlayers, forming a graphene confined sulfur structure. The 2D space-confined sulfur can work well in a carbonate-based electrolyte and show similar electrochemical behaviors of small sulfur molecules, indicating the special molecular form of sulfur in graphene layers. The 2D space-confined sulfur concept will be helpful for further understanding the electrochemical character of confined sulfur molecules and designing a high-performance sulfur cathode.

However, the poor energy density of LSBs owing to polysulfide shuttling and passivation has limited their further market penetration. To mitigate this challenge, two-dimensional (2D) siloxene (2DSi), a Si-based analog of graphene, is utilized as an additive for sulfur cathodes. The 2DSi is fabricated on a large scale by simple solvent extraction of calcium disilicide to form a thin-layered structure of Si planes functionalized with vertically aligned hydroxyl groups in the 2DSi. The stoichiometric reaction of 2DSi with polysulfides generates a thiosulfate redox mediator, secures the intercalation pathway, and reveals Lewis acidic sites within the siloxene galleries. The 2DSi utilizes the corresponding in-situ-formed electrocatalyst, the 2D confinement effect of the layered structure, and the surface affinity based on Lewis acid-base interaction to improve the energy density of 2DSi-based LSB cells. Combined with the commercial carbon-based current collector, 2DSi-based LSB cells achieve a volumetric energy density of 612 Wh L-cell(-1) at 1 mA cm(-2) with minor degradation of 0.17% per cycle, which rivals those of state-of-the-art LSBs. This study presents a method for the industrial production of high-energy-dense LSBs.

Here, the rational design of an N-doped carbon comb (NCC) as a new type of sulfur host for Li-S batteries, delivering a favorable performance, particularly a good cycling stability and rate capability, is reported. A novel dodecylamine micelle-induced self-assembling method is first proposed for constructing the NCC host which is built from close-packed hollow submicron carbon spheres. The interconnected carbon frameworks create good electrical conductive pathways. In addition, the high porosity and the N doping of the NCC host effectively suppress sulfur losses during cycling through synergistic physisorption and chemisorption effects. As a result, cathodes with 71 wt% of sulfur deposited in the NCC host possess superior capacities of 1090 and 553 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 2 C, respectively. After 300 cycles at 1 C, a reversible capacity of 562 mAh g(-1) is retained. Even at a high sulfur loading of 83 wt%, favorable performance is realized.

However, the adoption of Li-S batteries to date has been severely plagued by the polysulfide shuttling effect, whereby polysulfide molecules dissolve into the electrolyte and shuttle across the separator to react with the anode materials, leading to a rapidly fading capacity. Herein, by directly coating a thin layer of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/sodium lignosulfonate (SL) composite on the standard polypropylene (PP) separator, we produce a rGO@SL/PP separator with abundant negatively charged sulfonic groups in the porous lignin network, which effectively suppress the translocation of the negatively charged polysulfide (PS) ions without compromising the transport of positively charged Li+ ions. Using the rGO@SL/PP separator, we demonstrate a highly robust Li-S battery with a capacity retention of 74% over 1,000 cycles. This study defines an effective strategy to inhibit the PS shuttling effect for highly robust Li-S batteries.

But, their commercialized applications are hindered by fast capacity fading and poor cycling stability. In this work, sulfur hosts based on interwoven NiCo2O4 nanosheet/carbon nanotube composites are designed and synthesized by using a solvothermal reaction and subsequent annealing. In this unique material architecture, the carbon nanotubes construct a porous conductive network across the NiCo2O4 nanosheets to provide fast electron paths. In addition, the NiCo2O4 nanosheets can chemically bind polysulfides to restrain their diffusion into electrolyte. As a result, the Li-S batteries based on this sulfur host exhibit high specific capacity, excellent cycling stability, and good rate capability. Reversible specific capacities of 1311 and 575 mAhg(-1) are achieved at rates of 0.1 and 2 C, respectively, together with an excellent cycling stability of 0.038% capacity decay per cycle over 1200 cycles at 0.5 C.

Herein, we applied this strategy for the first time to efficiently recognize and trap long-chain polysulfides (Li2Sx, x = 6-8) in lithium sulfur battery to minimize the polysulfide shuttling between anode and cathode, which enables us to achieve remarkable electrochemical performance including a high specific capacity of 1262 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and superior capacity retention of over 82.5% after 400 cycles at 1 C. The outstanding performance is attributed to the significantly reduced concentration of long-chain polysulfides in electrolyte as evidenced by in situ UV/vis spectroscopy and Li2S nucleation tests, which were further confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The molecular imprinting is demonstrated as a promising approach to effectively prevent the free diffusion of long-chain polysulfides, providing a new avenue to efficiently recognize and trap lithium polysulfides for high-performance lithium sulfur battery with greatly suppressed shuttle effect.

Taking advantage of their redox properties, POMs are thus expected to be directly involved in the lithium-sulfur batteries ( Li-S, LSBs) system as a bidirectional molecular catalyst. Herein, we design a three-dimensional porous structure of reduced graphene-carbon nanotube skeleton supported POM catalyst as a high-conductive and high-stability host material. Based on various spectroscopic techniques and in situ electrochemical studies together with computational methods, the catalytic mechanism of POM clusters in Li-S battery was systematically clarified at the molecular level. The constructed POM-based sulfur cathode delivers a reversible capacity 1110 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C and cycling stability up to 1000 cycles at 3.0 C. Furthermore, Li-S pouch/beaker batteries with a POM-based cathode were successfully demonstrated. This work provides essential inputs to promote molecular catalyst design and its application in LSBs.

However, the low volumetric energy density and short cycle life are a bottleneck for their commercial application. To achieve high energy density for lithium-sulfur batteries, the concept of synergistic adsorptive-catalytic sites is proposed. Base on this concept, the TiN@C/S/Ta2O5 sulfur electrode with about 90 wt% sulfur content is prepared. TiN contributes its high intrinsic electron conductivity to improve the redox reaction of polysulfides, while Ta2O5 provides strong adsorption capability toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Moreover, the multidimensional carbon structure facilitates the infiltration of electrolytes and the motion of ions and electrons throughout the framework. As a result, the coin Li-S cells with TiN@C/S/Ta2O5 cathode exhibit superior cycle stability with a decent capacity retention of 56.1% over 300 cycles and low capacity fading rate of 0.192% per cycle at 0.5 C. Furthermore, the pouch cells at sulfur loading of 5.3 mg cm(-2) deliver a high areal capacity of 5.8 mAh cm(-2) at low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S, 3.3 mu L mg(-1)), implying a high sulfur utilization even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation.

After heating to 400 degrees C in air, the hexagonal beta-Ni(OH)(2) was converted into cubic NiO which showed better electrical conductivity and greater surface area compared with other annealing temperatures. The surface morphology remained almost unchanged, while the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets with solid interior were changed into NiO nanosheets composed of interconnected nanoparticles and mesopores after annealing at 400 degrees C. The sulfur-filled hollow mesoporous NiO microspheres obtained after annealing at 400 degrees C was loaded into the carbon paper as cathode (NiO/S) for lithium-sulfur batteries. The NiO/S cathode could deliver a large specific capacity of 1300 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C (335 mA g(-1)), much greater than bare sulfur loaded into the carbon paper (1000 mAh g(-1)). Moreover, the NiO/S cathode showed superior capacity recovery after C-rate test and coulombic efficiency during cycling test than S cathode. The improved performance for NiO/S could be attributed to the conductive NiO microspheres with mesoporous nanosheets that provided intimate electrical contact for boosting the charge-transfer reaction between lithium ions and sulfur materials, limited the polysulfide shuttle, and buffered volumetric expansion/contraction during charging and discharging.

Numerous efforts have been made to confine polysulfide species through physical adsorption and chemical bonding. Nevertheless, polysulfide accumulation is also ascribed to the slow redox kinetics. Herein, we design a kind of MoO3-x nanobelt with abundant engineered oxygen defects (ODs) on the surface to promote the redox kinetics as a cathode matrix for Li-S batteries. On one hand, engineered ODs exhibit considerable electrocatalytic activity for the conversion of polysulfide in kinetic processes, achieving distinctly improved capacities at large current densities. On the other hand, they enhance the interaction between MoO3 nanobelts and polysulfide molecules from a thermodynamic perspective, leading to an ameliorative cycling stability. This implementation of ODs in Li-S batteries substantially improves electrochemical performances and provides a novel method to introduce engineered defects into matrices for Li-S batteries.

To help lock sulfur and mitigate these problems, we introduce halloysites, a natural clay material with nanotube format, to disperse and confine sulfur nanoparticles as well as to suppress the dissolution and migration of polysulfides. Halloysites are firstly made conductive by covering with a glucose-derived carbon skin. Sulfur nanoparticles are then trapped in both lumen and outside surface of individual nanotubes with a loading dosage up to 80 wt%. In this new halloysite/sulfur composites cathode, the hollow nanostructure of halloysites provides space to allow dimension changes of encapsulated sulfur nanoparticles during repeated lithiation while limit their size up to the diameter of nanotube lumen (i.e., 25 nm or less). The stacked halloysite clusters further create many nanoscale voids to divide the sulfur-electrolyte interface into isolated domains and increase the migration tortuosity in electrolytes to suppress the dissolution and shuttle effect of polysulfides. These features together contribute to improved cycling stability, retaining nearly similar to 84% of the starting capacity over 250 cycles, though the diffusion of lithium ions into and out of nanotubes show some differences.

However, poor conductivity and shuttle effect of intermediate electrochemical reaction products limit its application. As good sulfur carriers, porous carbon materials can effectively remit these shortcomings. In this paper, a combination of a hydrothermal KOH activation and successive pyrolysis of biomass reed flowers is proposed to prepare a bimodal porous carbon (BPC) material with high specific surface area (1712.6 m(2) g(-1)). The as-obtained low-cost BPC/S cathodes exhibit excellent cycling performance (908 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C after 100 cycles), good rate capability and cyclability (663 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 1000 cycles), as well as a high areal capacity (6.6 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C after 50 cycles with a sulfur loading of 8.3 mg cm(-2)). Such excellent electrochemical performance was mainly ascribed to a specific bimodal porous structure with high specific surface area and plenty spaces for sulfur impregnating, which significantly reduces the escape of polysulfides during cycling and guarantees a good cycling stability. Moreover, the secondary class pores (mesopores and micropores) of the material offer plenty of small channels to improve the electronic and ionic transfer rate and, consequently, to enhance the rate capability. The as-synthesized BPC material presents a great potential as a sulfur carrier material for Li-S battery applications. In this work, we also demonstrate a simple route to develop low-cost carbon materials derived from renewable biomass which may expand and promote their use in energy storage applications.

Meso- and micro-porous particles, carbon nano tubes, and other sophisticated structures are used to actively retain highly soluble polysulfides which are responsible for capacity fading and a short cycle life. In this article we present a detailed 1+1D continuum model of SIC composite cathodes which is based on an ideal structure where all polysulfides are confined within meso- and micro-porous carbon particles. The model allows to correlate particle properties to cell performance and gives interesting insights for cell operation. Most interestingly we identified an additional overpotential caused by a transport of Li ions against a concentration gradient into the particle. Furthermore, the model can be used to find optimal structural and electrolyte properties such as pore volume, sulfur loading, solubility products, and salt concentration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the high solubility of intermediate products (i.e., lithium polysulfides) and the resultant shuttle effect lead to rapidly fading capacity and a low coulombic efficiency, which hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this study, block copolymers are constructed with both an ethylene oxide unit and a styrene unit and then used as binders for Li-S batteries. Electrochemical performance improvements are attributed to the synergistic effects contributed by the different units of the block copolymer. The ethylene oxide unit traps polysulfide, which bonds strongly with the intermediate lithium polysulfide, and enhances the transport of lithium ions to reach high capacity. Meanwhile, the styrene unit maintains cathode integrity by improving the mechanical properties and elasticity of the constructed block copolymer to accommodate the large volume changes. By enabling multiple functions via different units in the polymer chain, high sulfur utilization is achieved, polysulfide diffusion is confined, and the shuttle effect is suppressed during the cycle life of Li-S batteries, as revealed by operando ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and S K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur, dissolution of polysulfides (PS) in the electrolyte, and PS shuttle toward the Li anode restricted its reach to the market. In this paper, we present a porous carbon material with multifunctionalities derived from honeycomb (HC) used as a conductive host for sulfur for the first time. Honeycomb derived carbon-sulfur composite with 80% of sulfur [HCS (80%)] gives a high reversible capacity of 1101 mA h g(-1) at the 0.1 C rate after 200 cycles with 82% capacity retention. The coating of HC onto the cathode film [HCS (80%)] yielded 92% capacity retention, where sulfur is sandwiched between the two conductive hosts. Therefore, the HCS (80%) composite electrode with coating of HC [HCS (80%)-HC] exhibits good improvement in both cycling performance and rate capability compared to bare cathode HCS, even though the sulfur content of the HCS composite is as high as 80%. Thus, HCS (80%)-HC would be a potent combination for high-performance LSBs.

Herein, we developed a novel two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical yolk-shell heterostructure, constructed by a graphene yolk, 2D void and outer shell of vertically aligned carbon-mediated MoS2 nanosheets (G@void@MoS2/C), as advanced host-interlayer integrated electrode for Li-S batteries. Notably, the 2D void, with a typical thickness of similar to 80nm, provided suitable space for loading and confining nano sulfur, and vertically aligned ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets guaranteed enriched catalytically active sites to effectively promote the transition of soluble polysulfides. The conductive graphene yolk and carbon mediated shell sufficiently accelerated electron transport. Therefore, the integrated electrode of G@void@MoS2/C not only exceptionally confined the sulfur/polysulfides in 2D yolk-shell heterostructures, but also achieved catalytic transition of the residual polysulfides dissolved in electrolyte to solid Li2S2/Li2S, both of which synergistically achieved an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000 times at 2 C, outperforming most reported Mo based cathodes and interlayers for Li-S batteries. 2D hierarchical yolkshell heterostructures developed here may shed new insight on elaborated design of integrated electrodes for Li-S batteries.

However, the interface chemistries of electrode-electrolyte such as the shuttling effect of polysulfide and inadequate dynamic sulfur use have not yet been completely understood and managed when in operations, thus the employment of single-atom catalysts (SACs) provides the possibility to address these problems through the proper identification of structure-activity connexions and the chemical reaction processes at the atomic level. In this mini review, the usage of incredibly active SACs is examined with applications in long-lifecycle, higher-energy LSBs, as well as the possibility of SAC preparation using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to boost efficiency. Conclusively, the significant problems and future prospects for enhanced SACs via ALD in LSBs development are also discussed.

Among various host materials, metal oxides have become a promising host material due to their strong adsorption ability for the soluble polysulfide. Herein, feather duster liked CeO2 ceramics (FDCO) are synthesized via hydrothermal reaction with high surface area (198 m(2) g(-1)). While the sulfur is immersed into the feather duster liked CeO2, the as-prepared FDCO/S composites show superior capacity of 1436 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and a low capacity decay of 0.041% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2 C. The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the strong chemical bond of polysulfide to CeO2, as well as the mesopores in the CeO2 matrix. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, 2D siloxene nanosheets are developed by a rational wet-chemistry exfoliation approach, from which S@siloxene@graphene (Si/G) hybrids are constructed as cathodes in Li-S cells. The siloxene possesses corrugated 2D Si backbone with abundant O grafted in Si-6 rings and hydroxyl-functionalized surface, which can effectively intercept polysulfides via synergistic effects of chemical trapping capability and kinetically enhanced polysulfides conversion. Theoretical analysis further reveals that siloxene can significantly elevate the adsorption energies and lower energy barrier for Li+ diffusion. The LSBs assembled with 2D Si/G hybrid cathodes exhibit greatly enhanced rate performance (919, 759, and 646 mAh g(-1) at 4 C with sulfur loading of 1, 2.9, and 4.2 mg cm(-2), respectively) and superb durability (demonstrated by 1000 cycles with an initial capacity of 951 mAh g(-1) and negligible 0.032% decay rate at 1 C with sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2)). It is expected that the study presented here may open up a new vision toward developing high-performance LSBs with siloxene for practical applications.

To overcome these issues, we report the in situ growing MnO2 nanosheets on the hollow nitrogen-doped micropore-rich carbon (NMRC) to form NMRC/S@MnO2 nanocomposite with high sulfur content for advanced Li-S battery. The hollow nonpolar micropore-rich carbon nanospheres not only provide effectively structural confinement for active species but also accommodate the volume change during the charge-discharge process. The polar MnO2 nanosheets and doped nitrogen present strong chemisorption for LiPSs. Consequently, the synergistic dual-encapsulation from structural confinement and chemisorption makes the NMRC/S@MnO2 nanocomposite has a theoretical sulfur loading of 72% and exhibit a high initial specific capacity of 1144 mAh.g(-1) and a reversible capacity of 1023 mAh.g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Even after 1000 cycles at 2.0 C, a capacity of 590 mAh.g(-1) is maintained, among the best results for Li-S batteries. Our work reveals that the carefully design of sulfur-based composites with structural and chemical dual-encapsulation is promising to push forward the practical implementation of Li-S batteries.

Herein, distinctive three-dimensional microspheres composed of boron nitride (BN) nanosheets and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were applied to act as efficient sulfur cathode hosts for the first time using in a spray-drying process. Using this construction, the robust microsphere structure could shorten ion diffusion pathways and supply sufficient spaces to alleviate the volumetric expansion of sulfur during lithiation. Besides, the synergistic effect between BN and rGO significantly enhanced polysulfides adsorption capability and accelerated their conversion, verified by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and adsorption experiments. Consequently, the S-BN@rGO cathode could manifest the high initial capacity (1137 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C) and remarkable cycling/stability performance (572 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles). These results shed light on a design concept of high-performance sulfur cathode host materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, undesirable spontaneous formation of soluble polysulfides may arise in the ether electrolyte, and the conversion of sulfur in SPAN during the lithiation/delithiation processes is yet to be understood. Here, a highly reliable Li-S system using a freestanding fibrous SPAN cathode, as well as the sulfur conversion mechanism involved, is demonstrated. The SPAN shows high compatibility in both ether and carbonate electrolytes. The sulfur atoms existing in the form of short-S-2-and-S-3-chains are covalently bonded to the pyrolyzed PAN backbone. The electrochemical reduction of the SPAN by Li+ is a single-phase solid-solid reaction with Li2S as the sole discharge product. Meanwhile, the parasitic reaction between Li+ and C(sic)N bonds exists upon the first discharge, and the residual Li+ enhances the conductivity of the backbone. The recharge ability and rate capability are kinetically dominated by the activation of Li2S nanoflakes generated during discharge. At 800 mA g(-1), a specific capacity of 1180 mAh g(-1) is realized without capacity fading in the measured 1000 cycles, which makes SPAN promising for practical application.

Meanwhile, electrode materials are also particularly important for achieving good cycling stability and capability. Herein, we integrate CoS nanobox and conductive polypyrrole to boost cycle and rate performance based on synergy of physical encapsulating and chemical trapping. Benefiting from the superiority of ZIF-67 template and ion exchange strategy, the CoS nanobox possesses large interspace and porous structure, which effectively buffers volume change of electrode and generates adequate anchoring sites infiltrated by electrolyte. Polypyrrole layer can further inhibit polysulfide shuttling and accelerate electronic conductivity. The CoS@PPy as host presents low overpotential and fast kinetics. As a result, the CoS@PPy/S electrode with a sulfur content of 60% as a desirable candidate exhibits good sulfur utilization (initial discharge capacity of 1165 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 degrees C) and a capacity retention of above 80% with a capacity fading rate of 0.10% per cycle after 200 cycles at 0.5 degrees C. The design philosophy and fabricating technique of composite electrode with unique architectures can be further extended to assemble various metal compounds and conductive polymer for developing rechargeable batteries with high density energy storage.

Carbon is applied by thermal evaporation from a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) source at 600 degrees C for 5 h. It is shown that the carbon coating is impurity free, and the crystallinity of Li2S is well maintained. The electronic conductivity of Li2S is dramatically improved from 9.21 x 10(-9) S cm(-1) to 2.39 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) upon carbon coating. An all-solid-state battery prepared with the carbon-coated Li2S shows a high initial capacity of 585 mAh g(-1) (g of Li2S) that increases up to 730 mAh g(-1) (g of carbon-coated Li2S) by the 10th cycle. This high capacity is stable throughout the 25 cycles tested, with an excellent coulombic efficiency of 99%. Carbon-coated Li2S is advantageous for all-solid-state batteries due to the increased electrical conductivity, while allowing a reduction of the total carbon content present in the composite cathode.

The functional modifier layer allows for sulfur-involved transformations and also lithium plating behaviors. On the one hand, the sulfur cell with NbN@NC/PP separator exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate capacity. The good electrochemical performance partially results from the strong chemical interactions between NbN and lithium polysulfides via the formation of Nb-S and N-Li bonds, which is proven by the first-principles calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The formation of tiny nanoscrystals (<2 nm) and clusters tends to maximize the surface of NbN to interact with polysulfides and enable the effective catalysis over the sulfur-involved reactions. The higher exchange current density and Li+ diffusion coefficient of NbN@NC/PP cells experimentally verify that the introduction of NbN indeed catalytically accelerates the reaction kinetics. On the other hand, the performance of Li//Li symmetric cells demonstrates that the NbN@NC modifier layer can well induce homogeneous lithium deposition. This work confirms the application potential of NbN in lithium-sulfur batteries and encourages the exploration of prospective nitrides to engineer high performance next-generation batteries.

The incorporation of iron into the cubic nickel phase can induce strong electronic interaction and lattice distortion, thereby activating the inferior Ni phase to catalytically active Ni3Fe phase. Kinetics investigations reveal that the Ni3Fe phase promotes the redox kinetics of the multiphase conversion of Li-S electrochemistry. As a result, the Li-S cells assembled with a 70 wt % sulfur cathode and a Ni3Fe-modified separator deliver initial capacities of 1310.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and 598 mA h g(-1) at 4 C with excellent rate capability and a long cycle life of 1000 cycles at 1 C with a low capacity fading rate of similar to 0.034 per cycle. More impressively, the Ni3Fe-catalyzed cells exhibit outstanding performance even at harsh working conditions, such as high sulfur loading (7.7 mg cm(-2)) or lean electrolyte/sulfur ratio (similar to 6 mu L mg(-1)). This work provides a new concept on exploring advanced intermetallic catalysts for high-rate and long-life Li-S batteries.

J	Raulo, A; Gupta, A; Srivastava, R; Nandan, B				Raulo, Avinash; Gupta, Amit; Srivastava, Rajiv; Nandan, Bhanu			Excellent electrochemical performance of Lithium-sulfur batteries via self-standing cathode from interwoven ?-Fe2O3 integrated carbon nanofiber networks	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium?sulfur battery; Self-standing cathode; Electrospinning; Polysulfide dissolution; Catalytic effect		Lithium?sulfur batteries (LSBs) are one of the highly attractive next-generation electrochemical energy-storage systems owing to their high energy density at a low cost. However, the performance degradation of sulfur cathodes over repeated cycling remains a critical challenge to be addressed. Herein, the influence of a current collector-free and binder-free flexible self-standing cathode featured by three dimensional nanofibrous matrix composed of ?-Fe2O3 integrated carbon nanofiber (Fe-CNF) toward improving the electrochemical performance of LSB with the aid of an effective electrolyte penetration, Li+ migration and accommodating the volume variation is investigated. The physical barrier effect by the interwoven nanofibrous architecture and the intense chemisorption by the combined effect of polar ?-Fe2O3 and nitrogen-doped carbon restrict the dissolution and diffusion of soluble lithium polysulfides. In addition, the ?-Fe2O3 ensures the acceleration of polysulfide conversion reactions. Benefiting from this architecture, the cathode retains 92.5%, of its initial capacity, after 150 cycles at 0.2C-rate. Even after 650 cycles at a high rate of 1C, a significant capacity retention of 43.1% is attained, with an average capacity fade rate of 0.087% per cycle.

However, the rapid capacity decay caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides greatly limits its practical applications. In this work, we prepared an acetylene blackly/gamma-Al2O3/Polypropylene composite separator in a friendly and simple way to improve the performance of Li-S batteries. The gamma-Al2O3 layer can block the polysulfides diffusion and simultaneously improve the thermal stability of the separator. The acetylene black layer can reduce interface impedance, improve the utilization of active materials and also further block the shuttle of the polysulfides. The Li-S batteries equipped with this composite separator show better cycling performance with an initial discharge capacity of 1096 mAh g(-1) and a capacity decay as low as 0.08% per cycle for 500 cycles at 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) and rate performance with a reversible discharge capacity of 871 mAh g(-1) at 3 C. Our work can be used for coming commercialization of Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The 3D rGO-HCS nanostructure was first prepared via a hydrothermal self-assembly method followed by carbonization and etching of the SiO2 core, then sulfur was impregnated into the nanostructure by an in situ solution deposition method to obtain the S@rGO-HCS cathode. The as-prepared cathode material delivers a high discharge capacity of similar to 770 mA h g(-1) at 4 C rate. More importantly, it has a high capacity retention of 93.9% after 100 cycles and demonstrates a low capacity-decay rate of 0.052% per cycle after 400 cycles at 0.5 C rate. The superior comprehensive electrochemical performance of the S@rGO-HCS cathode is ascribed to the synergic effects from the 3D graphene-network design, including fast electron and ion transportation, efficient confinement of polysulfide dissolution and shuttling and successful maintenance of structural integrity.

Here, we successfully synthesize hierarchically porous gamma-Ti3O5 hollow nanospheres (p-Ti3O5) via carbothermal reduction for the first time. The p-Ti3O5 has the feature of large surface area (444.7 m(2) g(-1)), great pore volume (0.89 cm(3) g(-1)), and hierarchical pores. The high electronic conductivity of gamma-Ti3O5 phase and chemical interaction between titanium ions and polysulfides are beneficial for ion/electron migration and polysulfide confinement. The unique structure of the obtained p-Ti3O5 ensure sufficient active sites for chemical reaction, provide moving pathways for ion/electron migration, and inhibit structure collapse of cathode electrode during discharge/charge process. When the sulfur cathode is embedded in the p-Ti3O5 composite, it provides a reversible discharge capacity of 585 mAh g(-1) after prolonged 900 cycles at 0.5C rate with a capacity decay of 0.053% per cycle. It outperforms Ti3O5/S and TiO2/S cathodes on electrochemical performance. Even when sulfur loading is 5.8 mg cm(-2), p-Ti3O5/S electrode exhibits a considerable capacity of 5.9 mA h cm(-2). This work emphasizes advantages of high conductivity, chemical confinement of polysulfides, and hierarchically porous structure of p-Ti3O5 on sulfur cathode electrode for long-life lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, a novel multi-phase interface structure of embedded CoP and Co2P nanoparticles (CoxP NPs) on hollow N-doped carbon substance (CoxP/NC) was successfully fabricated by the in-situ conversion of ZIF-67@ZIF-8 dual templates. The abundant multi-phase interfaces on CoxP/NC enabled efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) capture, accelerated Li-ion diffusion, and boosted LiPSs conversion, thus forming a rapid and robust "adsorption-diffusion-conversion " network. Moreover, the well-defined hollow carbon polyhedrons physically inhibit the LiPSs diffusion and provide superior conductivity. As a result, the assembled S@CoxP/NC cathode with a high sulfur loading of 82% delivers an excellent rate capability (617.7 mAh g(-1) at 3C), impressive stability (a small capacity decay of 0.053% per cycle over 1250 cycles at 1C), and favorable durability of thick sulfur cathodes (with a high areal sulfur loading of 4.68 mg cm(2) over 300 cycles).

Even at a sulfur loading of 3.6 mg cm(-2), the Li-S battery with a VS2@CNTF interlayer demonstrated a discharge capacity of 970.6 mA center dot h center dot g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C. This outstanding performance of the sulfur cathode is partially attributed to the three-dimensional electrical conductive networks formed by the ultra-long intertwined carbon nanotubes, which facilitate the effective adsorption of lithium polysulfides by the VS2@CNTF interlayer, inhibiting the "shuttle effect." Furthermore, VS2@CNTF catalyzed the solid-solid reaction of Li2S2-Li2S to accelerate the reaction kinetics, thereby enhancing the rate performance.

However, their practical application is seriously hindered due to the poor conductivity and volume expansion of sulfur, the weak redox kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LPS), and the severe shuttle effect of LPS. Herein, V2O3 @N,Ni-C nanostructures, multiply integrated with zero-dimensional (0D) V2O3 nanoparticles, 1D carbon nanotubes, 2D carbon coating layers and graphene, 3D hollow spheres, and doped N and Ni heteroatoms, were synthesized via a solvothermal method followed by chemical vapor deposition. After being used as a modifier for traditional commercial separator of Li-S batteries, the shuttle effect of LPS can be effectively suppressed owing to the abundant active physical and chemical adsorption sites derived from large specific surface area, rich porosity, and tremendous polarity of the V2O3 nanoparticles with multiple secondary nanostructure integration. Meanwhile, the transfer of Li+ ions and electrons can be effectively enhanced by the highly conductive 2D carbon network, and the kinetics of redox reaction (Li2Sn <-> Li2S) can be accelerated by the doped N and Ni heteroatoms, leading to a synergistic promotion on the reutilization of the adsorbed LPS. Additionally, the unique 3D hollow structure can not only enhance the penetration of electrolyte, but also buffer the volume expansion of sulfur to some extent. Therefore, the rate capacity and cycling performance can be significantly enhanced by the multifunction synergism of adsorption, conductivity, catalysis, and volume buffering. An initial discharge capacity of 1590.4 mAh g(-1) can be achieved at 0.1C, and the discharge capacity of 803.5 mAh g(-1) can be still exhibited when increasing to 2C. After a long period of 500 cycles, additionally, the discharge specific capacity of 1142.2 mAh g(-1) and capacity attenuation of 0.0617% per cycle can be obtained at 1C.

Lithium-sulfur batteries with S/OP-HCS cathodes exhibit high sulfur utilization, excellent rate capabilities, and decent cycling stabilities. The S/OP-HCS cathode with 71 wt% sulfur demonstrates an excellent discharge capacity of 483 mAh g(-1) at the ultrahigh current of 5 C with an overpotential of approximate to 0.1 V. The cathode also presents an outstanding reversible capacity of 585 mAh g(-1) at 2 C over 200 cycles and a prolonged and stable 600-cycle performance with an average Coulombic efficiency of 97.0% cycle(-1) at 1 C. The unique hierarchically ordered porous structure of the OP-HCS conductive framework provides highly efficient Li+ diffusion and electron transfer, as well as excellent sulfur confinement. Overall, the fundamental understanding of the structural advantages of ordered porous OP-HCS is expected to inspire the development of new functional carbon nanomaterials for other applications.

The electrolyte membrane enables a stable and reversible Li-S electrochemical process already at 50 degrees C, with low resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interphase and fast Li+ transport. The relatively low molecular weight of the PEGDME and the optimal membrane composition in terms of salts and ceramic allow a liquid-like Li-S conversion reaction by heating at moderately high temperature, still holding the solid-like polymer state of the cell. Therefore, the electrochemical reaction of the polymer Li-S cell is characterized by the typical dissolution of lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte medium during discharge and the subsequent deposition of sulfur at the electrode/electrolyte interphase during charge. On the other hand, the remarkable thermal stability of the composite polymer electrolyte (up to 300 degrees C) suggests a lithium-metal battery with safety content significantly higher than that using the common, flammable liquid solutions. Hence, the Li-S polymer battery delivers at 50 degrees C and 2 V a stable capacity approaching 700 mAh g(S)(-1), with a steady-state coulombic efficiency of 98 %. These results suggest a novel, alternative approach to achieve safe, high-energy batteries with solid polymer configuration.

For comparison, an interlayer coated on separator was obtained by the slurry-coating method of powdery CCF. The key role of the adsorption capability is confirmed by comparing the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries with these two interlayers. In the Li-S batteries with 3D CCF interlayer, massive dissolved polysulfides, together with the electrolyte, can be adsorbed and confined in the 3D CCF interlayer, providing substantial extra active sites and alleviating the shuttle effect effectively. As a result, the Li-S batteries with 3D CCF interlayer show much enhanced utilization of active materials (1346.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C), prolonged cycle life (capacity retention of 80% after 100 cycles), and improved rate performance (553.2 mAh g(-1) at 4C). Even for cathodes with high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2), the cells with 3D CCF interlayer perform a high capacity of 1085 mAh g(-1) and retain 870.6 mAh g(-1) after 75 cycles at 0.5 mA cm(-2). These results not only provide a sustainable, low cost and easy-prepared 3D CCF interlayer, but also offer a promising strategy based on interlayer with high adsorption capability in designing high-performance Li-S batteries.

In addition, the low cost of sulfur and its small impacts on the environment also arise tremendous interests of industries and governments. However, lithium sulfur batteries are still severely plagued by the free migration of intermediary polysulfides, which are the roots of lithium sulfur batteries' challenges. Besides various cathode design, carbon-based modification layers on the separator are also developed to enhance the electrochemical performance of the lithium sulfur batteries. In this study, carbon nanofiber/CoS/Ketjen black is successfully integrated on the commercial separator as an effective polysulfide blocker. It is demonstrated that the cell with a carbon nanofiber/CoS/Ketjen black-modified separator and high sulfur content (70 wt %) cathode can exhibit excellent stability with a capacity decay of 0.076% per cycle for more than 700 cycles under 1.0 C current density. Especially, the robust and flexible coating strategy can greatly expand the range of materials available to be integrated on the commercial separator.

Herein, bimetallic NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) with a unique hierarchical micro-nano architecture is developed as an advanced sulfur reservoir for Li-S batteries. Compared with the monometallic Co-layered double hydroxide (Co-LDH) counterpart, the bimetallic configuration realizes much enriched, miniaturized, and vertically aligned LDH nanosheets assembled in hollow polyhedral nanoarchitecture, which geometrically benefits the interface exposure for host-guest interactions. Beyond that, the introduction of secondary metal intensifies the chemical interactions between layered double hydroxide (LDH) and sulfur species, which implements strong sulfur immobilization and catalyzation for rapid and durable sulfur electrochemistry. Furthermore, the favorable NiCo-LDH is architecturally upgraded into closely packed micro-nano clusters with facilitated long-range electron/ion conduction and robust structural integrity. Due to these attributes, the corresponding Li-S cells realize excellent cyclability over 800 cycles with a minimum capacity fading of 0.04% per cycle and good rate capability up to 2 C.

However, the notorious issue of higher-order lithium-polysulfides dissolution causes inferior cycling and poor electrochemical performance. To overcome the challenge, here, biodegradable and environmentally friendly carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) is used as the sulfur host. Further, Mn2O3 is incorporated in bacterial cellulose using hydrothermal synthesis and investigated as a sulfur host. The composite is prepared by a facile encapsulation "melt-diffusion " strategy. The high electronic conductivity of the CBC provides an efficient pathway to carry out redox reactions, and Mn2O3 helps to restrain and convert higher-order lithium-polysulfides to lower-order lithium-polysulfides. Further, the first-principle density functional theory calculation is performed to investigate and understand the role of carbon (CBC) and Mn2O3 in the host material. The lithium-sulfur cell with Mn2O3@CBC cathode host delivers a significantly high initial reversible capacity of 1150 mAh g((cathode))(-1) (i.e., 1450 mAh g((sulfur))(-1)) at 0.1 C. It retains a reversible capacity of 254 mAh g((cathode))(-1) (i.e., 554 mAh g((sulfur))(-1)) even at the ultra-high rate of 15.0 C. Furthermore, to achieve a practical high energy density and its commercial adoption, we tested lithium-sulfur cells with high areal sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2). The cell shows promising electrochemical performance for long 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 70%. The cell performance is competitive and superior to the current state-of-the-art lithium-sulfur cells reported in the literature.

However, the rapid capacity fading caused by the shuttle of polysulfide between two electrodes severely hinders the practical application of Li-S batteries. To address the issue, we reported a three-dimensional heterostructured TiO2 nanosheets/N-doped carbon (TO/NC), which is coated on a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, as an efficient barrier for Li-S batteries. The TO/NC coating layer provides a bipolar chemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) via TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets and N-doped carbon, showing high trapping capacity and remarkable electrocatalytic activity for LiPSs. The slurry-bladed carbon black/sulfur cathode with 64 wt% sulfur offers outstanding performance with an initial capacity of 1314 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C. Over 900 cycles, the cell still maintains the capacity of 448 mAh g(-1) at a 1 C rate with a degradation rate of only 0.055% per cycle. The separator reported in this work holds great promise for the development of high-energy Li-S batteries.

However, the sluggish kinetics and the inevitable "shuttle effect" severely limit the practical application of this technology. Recently, design of composite cathode with effective catalysts has been reported as an essential way to overcome these issues. In this work, oxygen-deficient ferric oxide (Fe2O3-x), prepared by lithiothermic reduction, is used as a low-cost and effective cathodic catalyst. By introducing a small amount of Fe2O3-x into the cathode, the battery can deliver a high capacity of 512 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles at 4 C, with a capacity fade rate of 0.049% per cycle. In addition, a self-supporting porous S@KB/Fe2O3-x cathode with a high sulfur loading of 12.73 mg cm(-2) is prepared by freeze-drying, which can achieve a high areal capacity of 12.24 mAh cm(-2) at 0.05 C. Both the calculative and experimental results demonstrate that the Fe2O3-x has a strong adsorption toward soluble polysulfides and can accelerate their subsequent conversion to insoluble products. As a result, this work provides a low-cost and effective catalyst candidate for the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Therefore, the incorporation of sulfur into carbon-based materials is considered as a suitable solution. Here, a porous pomelo biochar/graphene composite (PBG) was prepared via a simple and green method combining hydrothermal carbonization and KOH activation. The obtained material was used as a host to encapsulate sulfur for the cathode of Li-S batteries, and the three-dimensional pore structure with enhanced conductivity is beneficial for the utilization of sulfur and absorption of soluble polysulfides. As a result, the PBG-S composite (63.3 wt% sulfur) delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1053 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)) and retained 418 mA h g(-1) at 3C, even with a high sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm(-2). In addition, the performance of the composite was further improved by reducing the content of sulfur to an appropriate ratio in the PBG-S composite. The optimized PBG-S composite (48.6 wt% sulfur) exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1368 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and retained 638 mA h g(-1) at 3C, and the discharge capacity remained as high as 664 mA h g(-1) and 354 mA h g(-1) even after the 200th and 600th cycles at 1C, respectively. The results indicated that PBG, with excellent electrochemical properties, is an ideal electrode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, and can also be prepared economically on an industrial scale.

However, they are subjected to the "shuttle effect" of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, a free-standing membrane composed of two-dimensional MXene material (Ti3C2Tx) and graphene oxide (GO) is synthesized by a simple vacuum-filtration method. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy are carried out to determine structure, morphology, and composition of the Ti3C2Tx/GO composite membrane, respectively. As a functional layer of trapping LiPS species, the Ti3C2Tx/GO composite membrane and commercial polypropylene (PP) are successfully assembled to be a hybrid separator, Ti3C2Tx/GO@PP, to suppress the shuttle effect of LiPSs. The porous and rough surface of the Ti3C2Tx/GO composite membrane is beneficial to improve the wettability of the commercial separator in an ether-based electrolyte. The cells with the Ti3C2Tx/GO@PP hybrid separator exhibit a low polarization potential of 0.26 V in the conversion from Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S and deliver a discharge capacity of 640.0 mA h g(-1) for 5 C rate, indicating that the hybrid separator benefits the rate performance. According to the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, increased discharge capacity is attributed to the reduced internal resistance and intensified Li+ diffusion. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy focusing on the surfaces of both sides of the hybrid separator indicate that the shuttle effect of LiPSs is suppressed through a coefficient of the terminated groups' catalytic conversion on long-chain LiPSs and the titanium-reactive centers' Lewis acid-base pairs on short-chain LiPSs. Combining with digital photographs of the H-type electrolytic cell, the results of UV-visible absorption spectroscopy suggest that the concentration of long-chain polysulfides declines instantly under the redox effect of the terminated groups on Ti3C2Tx surfaces and then infiltrate through the hybrid separator by virtue of concentration difference impetus. Generally, a Ti3C2Tx/GO@PP hybrid separator restrains LiPS diffusion and improves the rate performance of Li-S batteries.

Li-S batteries will fulfill their theoretical potential if the problem of polysulfides shuttle effect can be solved. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been devoted to overcoming this problem from the aspects of physical confinement and chemisorption of polysulfides. Recently, it is discovered that replacing sulfur cathodes with lithium sulfide (Li2S) can not only largely avoid the volume expansion issue during cycling, but it can also work with anode materials other than lithium metal to eliminate serious safety concerns for traditional Li-S batteries. However, there are many challenges for developing practical Li metal-free Li-S battery systems, because Li2S-based cathode materials are moisture-sensitive and prelithiation of the non-Li metal anode materials is usually required for practical applications. This study reviews the recent advances of Li-S batteries based on Li2S cathode with features of improved safety, high Coulombic efficiency, and high energy density. The electrode activation processes are also discussed, which is critical for achieving high performances. It is anticipated that the extensive efforts will lead to breakthroughs for the development of Li2S cathode -based Li-S batteries.

However, the serious shuttle effect caused by the dissolution of the lithium polysulfides (LiPS) in electrolyte significantly degrades their cycling life and rate performance. Herein, the "binary active sites" concept in a Li-S battery system via the design of a cobalt vanadium oxide (CVO) modified multifunctional separator is designed. In the case of CVO, active vanadium sites simultaneously anchor the LiPS through the chemical affinity and active cobalt sites can dominate a rapid kinetic conversion. Such a synergistic effect contributes to improving the utilization of sulfur in the electrochemical process for the enhanced electrochemical performance. As a result, the Li-S battery with the CVO modified separator possesses a high reversible capacity of 1585.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and superior cycling stability with 0.012% capacity decay cycle(-1) after 3000 cycles. More impressively, the assembled soft-packaged Li-S devices can exhibit the excellent stability under bending states. This binary active sites strategy provides a route to design the functional materials for modifying separators of Li-S batteries to improve the performance.

An ideal sulfur host should possess high conductivity and embrace the physical confinement or strong chemisorption to dramatically suppress the polysulfide dissolution. Herein, uniform TiN hollow nanospheres with an average diameter of similar to 160 nm have been reported as highly efficient lithium polysulfide reservoirs for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Combining the high conductivity and chemical trapping of lithium polysulfides, the obtained S/TiN cathode of 70 wt.% sulfur content in the composite delivered an excellent long-life cycling performance at 0.5C and 1.0C over 300 cycles. More importantly, a stable capacity of 710.4 mAh.g(-1) could be maintained even after 100 cycles at 0.2C with a high sulfur loading of 3.6 mg.cm(-1). The nature of the interactions between TiN and lithium polysulfide species was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies. Theoretical calculations were also carried out and the results revealed a strong binding between TiN and the lithium polysulfide species. It is expected that this class of conductive and polar materials would pave a new way for the high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries in the future.

Electrostatic self-assembly of 2-dimensional MXene-wrapped sulfur composites for enhancing cycle performance of lithium-sulfur batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Lithium sulfur batteries; MXenes; Electrostatic self-assembly; MXene-wrapped sulfur composites	GRAPHENE OXIDE; CATHODE MATERIAL; PARTICLES; NANOSHEETS	For lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries to be used in practical applications, the low conductivity of elemental sulfur and the shuttle phenomenon need to be overcome together with the preparation of cathode material of a high sulfur content. Herein, we report a two-dimensional (2D) delaminated MXene-wrapped sulfur composite (S@d-MXene) synthesized via facile electrostatic self-assembly. The ultrathin and flexible 2D MXene wrapping of sulfur particles provides a pathway for lithium-ion transport and electron transfer while suppressing the shuttle phenomenon. In addition, the gap between sulfur particle and the D-MXene sheets wrapping its surface provides a buffering space for the volume expansion of the sulfur particle. The Li-S battery with a high sulfur content of 83.8% in S@d-MXene composite provides a capacity of similar to 506 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at a current density of 1C, with a Coulombic efficiency of 99% and an extremely low capacity decay rate (0.047% per cycle).

Herein, a synergistic strategy combining mesoporous architecture design and defect engineering is proposed to synthesize multifunctional defective 3D ordered mesoporous cobalt sulfide (3DOM N-Co9S8-x) to address the shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfide in Li-S batteries. The unique 3DOM design provides abundant voids for sulfur storage and enlarged active interfaces that reduce electron/ion diffusion pathways. Meanwhile, X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the surface defect engineering tunes the CoS(4)tetrahedra to CoS(6)octahedra on Co9S8, endowing abundance of S vacancies on the Co(9)S(8)octahedral sites. The ever-increasing S vacancies over the course of electrochemical process further promotes the chemical trapping of LiPS and its conversion kinetics, rendering fast and durable Li-S chemistry. Benefiting from these features, the as-developed 3DOM N-Co9S8-x/S cathode delivers high areal capacity, superb rate capability, and excellent cyclic stability with ultralow capacity fading rate under raised sulfur loading and low electrolyte content. This design strategy promotes the development of practically viable Li-S batteries and sheds lights on the material engineering in related energy storage application.

The C@AZO/S composite, with the sulfur content of 70 wt% and the sulfur mass loading of 2.2 mg cm(-2), delivers a high initial specific capacity of 974.2 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 0.5C (1C = 1675 mAh g(-1)) and a low capacity decay of 0.12% per cycle over 300 cycles. In this composite, the interconnected primary carbon spheres decorated by conductive AZO particles provide a fast charge transmission network which could greatly enhance the reaction kinetics and rate performance of Li-S batteries. Meanwhile, the integrated architecture of carbon cluster and the polarity brought by AZO could effectively reduce the dissolution of polysulfides to improve the cycle stability.

Partially unzipped carbon nanotubes for high-rate and stable lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; POROUS CARBON; LONG-LIFE; GRAPHENE; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; NANOCOMPOSITES; COMPOSITES; HYBRIDS; CELL	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are attractive due to a high theoretical energy density and low sulfur cost. However, they have critical drawbacks such as drastic capacity fading during cycling, especially under high current density conditions. We report a suitable carbon matrix based on partially unzipped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (UZ.CNTs), which have favorable properties compared to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and fully unzipped nanoribbons (UZ.NRs). Partially unzipped walls of MWCNTs lead to increased surface area and pore volume with a retained electron conduction pathway. This also provides accessible inner pores as a stable reservoir for polysulfides. This reservoir is decorated with newly introduced oxygen containing functional groups, and affords a synergistic effect of shortening the depth that electrons penetrate and interacting with polysulfides for high-performance Li-S batteries. The synergistic effect is revealed by Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting partially unzipped MWCNT sulfur composite delivers 707.5 mA h g(-1) at the initial discharge and retains 570.4 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles even at a high current rate of 5C (8375 mA g(-1)).

J	He, JR; Manthiram, A				He, Jiarui; Manthiram, Arumugam			Long-Life, High-Rate Lithium-Sulfur Cells with a Carbon-Free VN Host as an Efficient Polysulfide Adsorbent and Lithium Dendrite Inhibitor	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						carbon-free host; lithium metal anodes; lithium-sulfur batteries; uniform lithium nucleation	METAL ANODE; ELECTROCATALYST; ARCHITECTURE; CATHODE	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are a promising next-generation energy-storage system, but the polysulfide shuttle and dendritic Li growth seriously hinder their commercial viability. Most of the previous studies have focused on only one of these two issues at a time. To address both the issues simultaneously, presented here is a highly conductive, noncarbon, 3D vanadium nitride (VN) nanowire array as an efficient host for both sulfur cathodes and lithium-metal anodes. With fast electron and ion transport and high porosity and surface area, VN traps the soluble polysulfides, promotes the redox kinetics of sulfur cathodes, facilitates uniform nucleation/growth of lithium metal, and inhibits lithium dendrite growth at an unprecedented high current density of 10 mA cm(-2) over 200 h of repeated plating/stripping. As a result, VN-Li||VN-S full cells constructed with VN as both an anode and cathode host with a negative to positive electrode capacity ratio of only approximate to 2 deliver remarkable electrochemical performance with a high Coulombic efficiency of approximate to 99.6% over 850 cycles at a high 4 C rate and a high areal capacity of 4.6 mA h cm(-2). The strategy presented here offers a viable approach to realize high-energy-density, safe Li-metal-based batteries.

Covalent organic framework (COF) as a new porous crystalline material has been used as the host material in Li-S battery to improve the cell's cycling stability. In this paper, an imine-linked TAPB-PDA-COF was applied as the host material for sulfur loading (60%) in Li-S battery. The TAPB-PDA-COF has a beehive-like morphology with high thermal stability (up to 500 degrees C). In the electrochemical experiment, the performance of the composite cathode with acetylene black (A-B) and super-P (S-P) as the conductive additives was studied individually. The initial discharge capacity under 0.2A/g current density was 991 mAh/g and 1357 mAh/g for TAPB-PDA-COF/S@A-B and TAPB-PDA-COF/S@S-P, respectively. The better result of S-P based cathode than A-B could be due to the better conductivity of the S-P, as proved by the EIS results. When further increased the current density to 2A/g, the S-P based composite cathode can still deliver a comparable initial discharge capacity of 630 and 274 mAh/g capacity remained after 940 cycles. This results will inspire researchers develop more suitable conductive additives together with the host materials for high performance Li-S battery.

However, the dissolution of polysulfide intermediates could result in poor cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries and hinder its practical application. In this work, a novel neodymium oxide (Nd2O3) nanoparticle doped the oxidized-acetylene black/sulfur (H-AB/S@Nd2O3) composite has been synthesized through in situ chemical deposition and solvent dispersion. The as-oxidized acetylene black is served as the conductive carbon scaffold and the as-prepared Nd2O3 nanoparticles, acting as the additive of the H-AB/S composite, can effectively alleviate the loss of polysulfides. As a result, the sulfur-based composite with 5 wt% Nd2O3 nanoparticles exhibits the high specific capacity and excellent cycling stability. The initial discharge capacity is 1171 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and remains at 748 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 63.9%. Even at a high current density of 1 C, the electrode delivers a maximum discharge capacity of 700 mAh g(-1) after activation and the capacity retention is approximately 68% after 200 cycles.

The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery with rGO-coated separator exhibits much smaller impedance and much better electrochemical performance. After coated rGO, the initial discharge capacity can be as large as 1067 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C which can retain 878 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, and the discharge capacity can reach 710 mAh g-1 even at 2 C. The significant performance enhancement can be attributed to the bi-functionality of rGO; the rGO coating layer has unique porous structure, high conductivity and various kinds of functional groups, which can not only effectively prevent the diffusion of polysulfide through the separator, but also significantly increase the conducting surface between cathode and separator. It is promising to use rGO-based slurry to continuously produce large-scale, low-cost, and bi-functional rGO coated separator for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the durable operation for the batteries is blocked by the shuttle behavior of soluble lithium polysulfides and the sluggish kinetics in the redox process. Here, VN nanoparticles on nitrogen-doped graphene (VN/NG) composite is synthesized by simple calcining method to modify the separators, which can not only chemically trap polysulfides, but also catalyze the conversion reaction between the polysulfides and the insoluble Li2S during the charge/discharge process. The catalytic effects of VN/NG are verified by the calculated activation energy (E-a), which is smaller than the counterpart with NG toward both directions of redox. Because of the synergistic adsorption-catalysis of VN/NG, the cells with VN/NG-modified separators deliver a superior rate performance (791 mAh g(-1) at 5C) and cycling stability (863 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles with a low decaying rate of 0.068% per loop at 1C). This work provides a simple preparation strategy and fundamental understanding of the bifunctional catalyst for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Our synthetic approach introduces a new way of preparing CTFs under environmentally benign conditions by the direct utilization of elemental sulfur. The homogeneous sulfur distribution is due to the insitu formation of the framework structure, and chemical sulfur impregnation within the micropores of CTF effectively suppresses the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte. Furthermore, the triazine framework facilitates electron and ion transport, which leads to a high-performance lithium-sulfur battery.

Evaluating silicene as a potential cathode host to immobilize polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF COORDINATION CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; internal shuttle effect; silicene; polysulfide retention; surface passivation	NITROGEN-DOPED CARBON; HIGH-ENERGY-DENSITY; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; HIGH-CAPACITY; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; POROUS CARBON; LI2S; MECHANISM; ANODE; 1ST-PRINCIPLES	The internal shuttle effect caused by polysulfides dissolution and migration negatively impacts lithium-sulfur battery performance. In this work, a mesoscale simulation strategy, which involves atomistic calculation and coarse-grained molecular modeling, is employed to evaluate silicene as a potential cathode host material to immobilize polysulfides. Adsorption energies of insoluble polysulfides (Li2Sx with x=1, 2) and soluble polysulfide Li2S4 on pristine and doped silicene sheets are calculated. Results show that the adsorption is thermodynamically favorable and N-doped silicene is helpful in trapping intermediate discharge products, Li2S2 and Li2S4. The dissociation and reduction of long-chain polysulfides to short-chain polysulfides are observed. Electronic structure analysis shows that Li2Sx molecules interact with silicene via strong chemical bonds. The atomistic structure evolution of Li2S layer formation on silicene is also investigated in this study. It is found that Li2S (110) layer forms first, and then, it is converted to Li2S (111) layer by introducing more Li2S molecules to the substrate. Li2S (111)/silicene interfacial structure is thermodynamically stable, and the interaction is dominated by Li-Si bonds. A coarse-grained model is developed to study and compare the growth of Li2S on silicene and graphene. Li2S-induced surface coverage is faster on silicene than on graphene, which indicates that a silicene-based cathode host will experience more acute surface passivation, which will adversely affect cathode performance.

The as-prepared electrodes by a synergistic method of electrospinning, template sacrificing and activation for Li-S batteries without any binder or conductive additives but a 3D interconnected conductive network offered multiple transport paths for electrons and improved sulfur utilization and facilitated an easy access to Li+ ingress/egress. With the increase of density of hollow carbon spheres in the strings, the self-supporting composite electrode reveals an enhanced synergistic mechanism for sulfur confinement and displays a better cycling stability and rate performance. It delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1422.6 mAh g(-1) at the current rate of 0.2C with the high sulfur content of 76 wt.%, and a much higher energy density of 754Wh kg(-1) and power density of 1901 Wh kg(-1), which greatly improve the energy/power density of traditional lithium-sulfur batteries and will be promising for further commercial applications.

Recent approaches such as introducing catalytic materials to facilitate polysulfide conversion have been explored, yet the results remain unsatisfactory. Here, we present an optimized Li-S electrode featured by a large amount of highly dispersed Co3S4 nanoparticles (similar to 10 nm in size) throughout a hierarchical carbon nanostructure hybridized from ZIF-67 and carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge. This enables homogeneous distribution and close contact between infiltrated sulfur and Co3S4 nanoparticles within the ZIF-67-derived N-doped carbon nanocubes, leading to effective chemical interaction with polysulfides, maximum catalytic effect and enhanced lithium ion diffusion, while the built-in three-dimensional CNT network ensures high electrical conductivity of the electrode. As a consequence, the Li-S battery exhibits both extraordinary rate performance by maintaining a capacity of similar to 850 mAh g(-1) at very high charge/discharge rate (5 C) and long-term cycling stability with 85% retention after 1000 cycles at 5 C (an average capacity fading rate of only 0.0137% per cycle).

Here, high energy ball-milling with the assistance of dielectric barrier discharge plasma was used in synthesis of ultrafine sulfur particles anchored on in situ exfoliated graphene for Li-S batteries. The ultrafine sulfur particles formed not only afford more sufficient electrical contact towards graphene support, but also alleviate volume expansion compared with bulk sulfur. On the other hand, with robust etching function of dielectric barrier discharge plasma, little oxygen-doping was observed in exfoliated few-layer graphene, offering sufficient capture sites towards lithium polysulfides. The ultrafine sulfur/graphene composite with little oxygen-doping exhibits superior cycling performance and rate capability in contrast to the control samples without the exertion of dielectric barrier discharge plasma. Little capacity degradation rate of 0.07% per cycle was achieved at 0.5C over 500 cycles.

J	Li, TT; He, C; Zhang, WX				Li, Tongtong; He, Cheng; Zhang, Wenxue			Two-dimensional porous transition metal organic framework materials with strongly anchoring ability as lithium-sulfur cathode	ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; vdW interaction; Metal organic framework; Shuttle effect; Density functional theory	PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; BATTERY; MONOLAYER; CHALLENGES; NANOSHEETS; MECHANISM; CAPACITY; ROBUST	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are regarded as promising candidates for energy storage devices due to their high theoretical energy density. An ideal Li-S batteries cathode should effectively prevent polysulfide dissolution in order to achieve longer cycle life and higher rate performance. Herein, a new 2D transition metal organic framework material, hexaaminobenzene-based coordination polymers (HAB-CPs), has been systematically investigated as cathode candidate materials for Li-S batteries. First principles calculations combined with the vdW interaction and solvent model reveal that V-HAB-CP has the best ability to hinder the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides among the three polymers (V, Cr and Fe-HAB-CPs). Quantum conduction (G) and density of states (DOS) calculations indicate that HAB-CPs maintain excellent conductivity during the whole charging process. Moreover, a very small volume change (about 3.06%) of V-HAB-CP before and after the electrode reaction can well deal with the volume expansion problem of Li-S batteries. Meanwhile, the energy density reaches 808.465 W h kg(-1) when the electrode reaction product is Li16S8 /V-HAB-CP. Attributed to these benefits, V-HAB-CP is a suitable cathode material, which is expected to be used in future Li-S battery systems. The computational method adopted in this paper can provide a guidance for considering the influence of electrolytes on the Li-S batteries in the future and be widely used in other simulation calculations involving the solution effect.

In this work, 3D MoS2 nanoporous spheres (MoS2-NPSs), exposing abundant active edges by decorating on conductive reduced graphene oxide aerogels (rGOA/GA), were fabricated as an S host to construct the S@MoS2@GA cathodes. An S@MoS2@GA-0.425 cathode constructed as such delivered an initial capacity of 688 mAh g(-1) and arrived at a high discharge capacity of 565 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C; moreover, a reversible capacity of 324 mAh g(-1) retained for the electrode after 500 cycles at 1.0C with a slow capacity fading rate of 0.054% per cycle. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the strong interactions of 3D MoS2@GA with lithium polysulfides intermediates (Li2Sn where 4 <= n <= 8), and the fast lithium ion and electron transport channels formed in the cathode for the sulfur redox reaction. More importantly, the MoS2-NPSs electrocatalyst could chemically adsorb the Li2Sn to fix soluble ones near the conductive GA surface and also could kinetically accelerate the transformation of Li2Sn.

J	Zhen, MM; Zuo, XT; Wang, J; Wang, C				Zhen, Mengmeng; Zuo, Xintao; Wang, Juan; Wang, Cheng			An integrated cathode with bi-functional catalytic effect for excellent-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	NANO RESEARCH			English	Article						bi-functional catalysis; polysulfides; redox reaction; chemical adsorption; lithium-sulfur batteries	CARBON NANOTUBES; DOPED GRAPHENE; NITROGEN; SCAFFOLDS; CAPACITY; REDOX	The high energy density of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is mainly based on the complex redox reactions and phase conversions. The sluggish redox kinetics and the large accumulation of soluble polysulfides in the electrolyte leads to low sulfur utilization and serious shuttle effect. Herein, an integrated sulfur cathode is constructed through a facile and large-scale method. It is composed of sulfur-N, S doped bamboo like CNTs@Co3S4 (CNTs@Co3S4) composites on polypropylene separator. The immobilized polysulfides on the CNTs@Co3S4 surface are further reduced/oxidized during the discharge/charge process via the efficient bi-functional catalytic effect of CNTs@Co3S4, resulting in the rapid conversion of LiPSs. Consequently, the integrated sulfur cathode delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 1,473.6 mAhg(-1) at 0.2 C and a high specific capacity of 979 mAhg(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles as well as excellent cycling stability for 1,000 cycles with a high specific capacity of 362.5 mAhg(-1) at 5 C, which are superior to reported similar host materials.

Herein, we propose a simple synthesis of metallic cobalt-embedded N-doping carbon nanotubes (Co@NCNT) as a "two-in-one" host of sulfur for efficient Li-S batteries. In the binary host, the N-doped CNTs, cooperating with metallic Co nanoparticles, can serve as 3D conductive networks for fast electron transportation, while the synergetic effect of metallic Co and doping N heteroatoms helps to chemically confine polysulfides, acting as active sites to accelerate electrochemical kinetics. With these advantages, the S/Co@NCNT composite delivers an excellent cycling stability with a capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle averaged within 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g(-1) and a high rate performance of 530 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1). Further, the superior electrochemical performance of the S/Co@NCNT electrode can be maintained under a high sulfur loading up to 4 mg cm(-2). Our work demonstrates a feasible strategy to design promising host materials simultaneously featuring high conductivity and strong confinement toward polysulfides for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, inevitable lithium polysulfide intermediates' dissolution and migration severely hamper their energy density and calendar life. Therefore, it is of significance to restrain the inevitable polysulfide shuttle effect in electrolytes. Herein, a new type of sulfur-containing polymeric cathode, poly(vinyl trimethoxysilane-co-sulfur) (PVTS), is successfully synthesized by an inverse vulcanization method to solve the polysulfide problem. The well-designed sulfur-containing polymer endows the Li-S battery with better performance, which has several features that are discussed below. First, the covalent bonding of the sulfur atom and the carbon atom of vinyl trimethoxysilane in PVTS effectually limits the polysulfide diffusion and further lessens the polysulfide dissolution, thereby preventing the loss of active materials. Second, a good liquid electrolyte wettability is conducive to the electrochemical reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In the end, a faster charge transfer rate and a favorable lithiation/delithiation kinetics facilitate the electrochemical process. Accordingly, the PVTS/C cathode shows significantly enhanced cycling stability after 500 cycles and excellent rate performance.

By modifying the battery separator with specific materials, the shuttle effect can be effectively alleviated. Herein, two-dimensional (2D) TiN@C sheets obtained by in-situ nitridation of MXene (Ti3C2Tx, T means the termination groups, such as -F, -O, and -OH) are designed as the traps and catalysts for LiPSs in Li-S batteries. TiN@C has strong chemical absorptivity of LiPSs and can promote their conversion to Li2S2/Li2S. By mixing with graphene, which servers as a conductive network and physical barrier, a TiN@C/G separator coating is fabricated via a vacuum filtration method. Based on the carbon black/sulfur (CB/S) cathode and TiN@C/G coated separator, the batteries deliver a surprising initial discharge capacity at 0.1 C (1490.2 mAh g(-1)) and show a extremely low capacity loss over 600 cycles at 1 C (0.047% per cycle). This work shows new views into the design of separator coating using 2D materials for Li-S batteries with high capacity and stability. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the unfavorable shuttle effect caused by dissolved polysulfides during charging/discharging processes results in low Coulombic efficiency (CE), poor interfacial stability, uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth and rapid capacity degradation, hindering the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a highly stable armor-like artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer for Li metal anode was formed based on the spontaneous interaction between Li metal and 4-chlorophenylboronic acid (CPB). First, this artificial SEI layer can avoid the direct contact between Li anode and electrolyte, therefore eliminating the corrosion reaction between Li metal anode and polysulfides in electrolyte. Second, the artificial SEI layer with high durability can effectively suppress lithium dendrite growth and stabilize Li anode/electrolyte interface. As consequence, the Li/Li symmetric cells show the lengthened cycling life over 500 h with steady and low polarization voltage under the condition of 1.0 mA cm(-2) for 1.0 mAh cm(-2). Furthermore, the Li-S cells with modified Li metal anode deliver superior cycling performance and higher CE at various sulfur loadings and rate conditions than those of the cells with pristine Li. This work highlights the key role of artificial SEI layer on stabilizing the Li anode, providing a new pathway for Li metal protection in Li-S batteries development. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

As-prepared porous carbon possesses a high specific surface area of 1211.6 m(2) g(-1) and a pore volume of 0.59 cm(3) g(-1), acquires oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of framework and functionalizes for the chemical adsorption of elemental sulfur. Under N-2 atmosphere (flow rate similar to 60 mL min(-1)) the longer is the sulfur-loading time, the lower value is the total sulfur content of carbon-sulfur composite and the higher percentage of sulfur embedded within the micropores. At a sulfur-loading time of similar to 10 h, the resulting C-S-10 composites have a total sulfur content as low as 50.0 wt% (44.8% in micropores) but exhibit the better electrochemical performances than C-S-6 composites formed at 6 h (sulfur similar to 58.8 wt%, 29.4% in micropores). Therefore, aside from the structural properties of porous carbon, an optimized sulfur-loading time, as well as the chemical binding between carbon host and sulfur, should be considered to develop high-performance cathode materials for liquid electrolyte lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.

However, the development of Li-S batteries is hindered by the electrochemical performance decay that resulted from low electrical conductivity of sulfur and serious shuttling 1500 effect of intermediate polysulfides. Moreover, the areal capacity is usually restricted by the low areal sulfur loadings (1.0-3.0 mg cm(-2)). When the areal sulfur loading increases to a practically accepted level above 3.0-5.0 mg cm(-2), the areal capacity and cycling life tend to become inferior. Herein, we report an effective polysulfide mediator composed of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) forest planted on cobalt nanoflowers (N-CNTs/Co-NFs). The abundant pores in N-CNTs/Co-NFs can allow a high sulfur content (78 wt %) and block the dissolution/diffusion of polysulfides via physical confinement, and the Co nanoparticles and nitrogen heteroatoms (4.3 at. %) can enhance the polysulfide retention via strong chemisorption capability. Moreover, the planted N-CNT forest on N-CNTs/Co-NFs can enable fast electron transfer and electrolyte penetration. Benefiting from the above merits, the sulfur filled N-CNTs/Co-NFs (S/N-CNTs/Co-NFs) cathodes with high areal sulfur loadings exhibit low self-discharge rate, high areal capacity, and stable cycling performance.

Unfortunately, several issues of Li-S battery, such as sluggish reaction kinetics, severe polysulfides shuttle effect and volume ex-pansion, still hinder the commercialization of Li-S battery. Herein, a synergistic strategy is proposed, which comprises polyethyleneimine (PEI)-multi-walled carbon nanotube-Super P (PMS) coating modified on PP separator and uniformly distributed cobalt nanocrystals in N-doped porous carbon nanofiber (Co/PCNF) as a freestanding interlayer in the cathodic side of Li-S battery. Benefiting from abundant amino/imine groups of protonated PEI and catalytic Co active sites in conductive porous carbon skeleton, the Co/PCNF-PMS bilayer architecture can not only intensely anchor the negatively charged polysulfides via electrostatic interaction but also fast electrocatalyze the sulfur redox reaction. The synergistic effect of the Co/PCNF-PMS bilayer enable the Li-S battery with a high initial capacity of 1537 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), extended cycling stability of only 0.06% per cycle capacity fade over 300 cycles at 2000 mA g(-1) and outstanding performance under high raised sulfur loading up to 6 mg cm(-2).

Herein, the deficient coordination of single-atom Fe site is firstly and theoretically predicted to endorse higher sulfur affinity and catalytic activity, due to the stronger hybridization between Fe 3d(zz) and S 3p(y) orbitals compared with that in common FeN4 scenario. The following validation is conducted to prepare the monodispersed Fe single atoms with tuned coordination number on nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as FeN2-NC and FeN4-NC) via the ligand control on the Fe precursor. As expected, the undercoordinated FeN2-NC fulfills significantly stronger sulfur immobilization and catalyzation as confirmed by a series of physicochemical and electrochemical evaluations. As a result, sulfur electrodes hosted by FeN2-NC realize excellent cyclability and rate capability, and particularly, a highly reversible areal capacity up to 4.5 mAh cm(-2) under a high areal sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 5.3 mL g(-1). This work highlights the great feasibility and validity of coordinative defect engineering in single-atom catalysts for improving the Li-S battery electrochemistry, which could also enlighten advanced material designs in other related energy areas.

However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), low sulfur loading and sluggish redox kinetics severely restrict available applications of LSBs. Herein, the MnO2 nano-flowers are synthesized on the surface of acrylic cloth carbon (ACC/MnO2) through hydrothermal process and used to decorated separator as a shuttle-inhibiting layer and catalyst for LSBs. Density functional theory (DFT) and Li+ diffusion coefficient (DLi+) calculations demonstrate that MnO2 exhibits strong chemical interacts with LiPSs and facilitate a rapid conversion of trapped LiPSs. Consequently, the batteries with ACC/MnO2 decorated separator exhibit a satisfactory rate performance and ultra-long cycle life of 500 cycles with a very low decay rate of 0.065% per cycle at 1.5C. Besides, the battery with a high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2), delivers a high reversible capacity of 712 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.2C. Even the sulfur loading increase to 8 mg cm(-2) with low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (6.25 mu L mg(-1)), the battery delivers a high reversible capacity of 686 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C.

Herein, we report the design and fabrication of dual-confined sulfur nanoparticles that were encapsulated inside hollow TiO2 spheres; the encapsulated nanoparticles were prepared by a facile hydrolysis process combined with acid etching, followed by "wrapping" with graphene ( G-TiO2@S). In this unique composite architecture, the hollow TiO2 spheres acted as effective sulfur carriers by confining the polysulfides and buffering volume changes during the charge-discharge processes by means of physical force from the hollow spheres and chemical binding between TiO2 and the polysulfides. Moreover, the graphene-wrapped skin provided an effective 3D conductive network to improve the electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode and, at the same time, to further suppress the dissolution of the polysulfides. As results, the G-TiO2@S hybrids exhibited a high and stable discharge capacity of up to 853.4 mAhg(-1) over 200 cycles at 0.5 C ( 1 C=1675 mAg(-1)) and an excellent rate capability of 675 mAhg(-1) at a current rate of 2 C; thus, G-TiO2@S holds great promise as a cathode material for Li-S batteries.

In contrast to pure sulfur, Li2S opens the opportunity to implement alternative anodes such as silicon or graphite instead of hardly controllable lithium metal. However, its intrinsically low conductivity and the formation of soluble lithium polysulfide species during cell operation resulting in a poor cycling stability, especially in carbonate-based electrolytes. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide-wrapped Li2S particles (Li2S@rGO) electrode is presented for improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries in carbonate-based electrolytes. A hydrothermally prepared rGO-covered MoS 2 particles composite was fully lithiated and irreversible decomposed at 0.01 V vs. Li/Li+ to in situ produce a Li2S@rGO composite with a high Li2S loading of approximate to 5 mg cm(-2). Despite operating Li-S cells in a conventional carbonate-based electrolyte, the resulting cathode exhibits high initial capacity (975 mAh g(Li2S)(-1) and 1401 mAh g(s)(-1) at 0.1 C), low degradation rate (0.18% per cycle after 200 cycles at 2 C) and excellent Coulombic efficiency ( approximate to 99.5%). This work provides a simple strategy to fabricate practical high-loading Li2S cathodes for high- performance Li-S batteries "free" of polysulfide shuttle phenomenon. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The deposition of solid Li2S from liquid Li2S, contributes to three-quarters of the total theoretical capacity and is therefore of great significance over the entire cathode reaction. This study demonstrates a cathode material composed of carbon nanofibers decorated with catalytic Co phthalocyanine nanorods (CoPc@CNF), which are highly effective in promoting the deposition of Li2S in three-dimensional (3D) fine particles rather than 2D thin films. This significantly alleviates cathode passivation during cell charge and discharge, leading to obviously improved sulfur utilization and cycling stability for high loading cathodes. DFT calculations indicate that the promoted 3D deposition of Li2S is related to the facilitated migration of deposition precursors (Li2S4 and Li-ions) to migrate on the CoPc nanorods. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) pouch cells were prepared with high specific (954 mAh g(-1)), areal (4.8 mAh cm(-2)), and total (235 mAh) capacities achieved at 0.5 C under high sulfur content. As metal phthalocyanines possess a high structural variability, this study provides opportunities to the design of a new class of Li-S cathode materials.

Herein, a double-shelled hollow polyhedron with inlaid cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon (Co/NC) nanodots (Co-NC@Co9S8/NPC) is reported, which is acquired by using imidazolium-based ionic-polymer-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 as a core-shelled precursor. The Co/NC nanodots promote redox kinetics and chemical adsorbability toward polysulfides, while the interconnected double shells serve as a nanoscale electrochemical reaction chamber, which effectively suppresses the polysulfide shuttling and accelerates ion/electron transport. Benefiting from structural engineering and reaction kinetics modulation, the Co-NC@Co9S8/NPC-S electrode exhibits high cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.011% per cycle within 2000 cycles at 2 C. The electrode still shows high rate performance and cyclability over 500 cycles even in the case of high sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2) and 75 wt% sulfur content. This work provides one type of new hollow nanoarchitecture for the development of advanced Li-S batteries and other energy storage systems.

J	Park, D; Park, S; Kim, DW				Park, Dongjoo; Park, Sangbaek; Kim, Dong-Wan			Electrospun-cellulose derived free-standing carbon nano fi bers as lightweight, ultrathin, and stackable interlayers for lithium-sulfur batteries	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Cellulose; Interlayer; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Free-standing; Electrospinning		The insertion of an interlayer between the separator and cathode is considered a promising strategy to improve the conductivity as well as suppress the polysulfide shuttling effect in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). However, the fundamental disadvantages of loss in weight/volume capacity and high cost upon the addition of an interlayer brings significant challenges. Herein, we report free-standing carbon nanofibers based on electrospun-cellulose (ACCF) as a lightweight (0.38 mg cm(-2)) and ultrathin (10 mu m) interlayer for LSBs. The unique semi carbonization of cellulose precursors provides a large surface area (2665.2 m(2) g(-1)) and high conductivity (6.5 S cm(-1)) to overcome the conductivity-surface area trade-off in conventional interlayers. Interestingly, the high wettability of ACCF is induced by the functional groups in cellulose, which decreases the electrolyte demand and enables the material to be stacked into multiple layers. This allows a conceptual study providing the scientific clue for the critical material factor in the LSB interlayer. Benefitting from its multi-functional characteristics, ACCF-modified cell provides a high specific capacity of 1403 mA h g(-1) and a remarkable areal capacity 4.83 mA h cm(-2) (S loading 4.6 mg cm(-2)) at 0.1C. Therefore, this innovative, cheap, and scalable ACCF can be used as a practical interlayer toward the commercialization of high-energy LSBs.

Nevertheless, the notorious shuttle of polysulfides hinders the advancement of Li-S batteries. Herein, a two-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) with extended pi-conjugated units has been designed, synthesized, and used as sulfur recipients with 88.4 wt % in loading. The COF offers an elaborate platform for sufficient Li-S redox reactions with almost theoretical capacity release (1617 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C), satisfactory rate capability, and intensively traps polysulfides for a decent Coulombic efficiency (ca. 98.0%) and extremely low capacity decay (0.077% per cycle after 528 cycles at 0.5 C). The structural factors of the COF on the high-performance batteries are revealed by density functional theory calculations to be the high degrees of conjugation and proper interlayer space. This work not only demonstrates the great potential of COFs as highly efficient sulfur recipients but also provides a viable guidance for further design of COF materials to tackle shuttling issues toward active materials in electrochemical energy storage.

A surface modification on the sulfur/carbon composite would be an efficient strategy to enhance the cycling stability. Herein, we report a nickel hydroxide-modified sulfur/conductive carbon black composite (Ni(OH)(2)@S/CCB) as the cathode material for the Li-S battery through the thermal treatment and chemical precipitation method. In this composite, the sublimed sulfur is stored in the CCB, followed by a surface modification of Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles with size of 12 nm. As a cathode for the Li-S battery, the as-prepared Ni(OH)(2)@S/CCB electrode exhibits better cycle stability and higher rate discharge capacity, compared with the bare S/CCB electrode. The improved performance is largely due to the introduction of Ni(OH)(2) surface modification, which can effectively suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides, resulting in enhanced cycling life and higher capacity.

To solve these issues, we have designed cubic pyrite-structure NiS2 nanospheres modification of Ketjen black@sulfur (NiS2/KB@S) composite as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. The NiS2 nanospheres have a positive effect on the adsorption and catalysis performance of the lithium polysulfides, which further facilitates the redox kinetics. Consequently, the NiS2/KB@S cathode with 3.1 mg cm-2 sulfur loading attains a discharge capacity of 869 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and reversible capacity is 461 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles. Even at high sulfur loading of 5.3 mg cm-2, the NiS2/KB@S electrode still delivers a high initial area capacity of 4.82 mAh cm-2 at 0.2 C with capacity retention capacity of 3.74 mAh cm(-2 )after 120 cycles. The cyclic and rate properties of NiS2/KB@S are greatly improved over that of KB@S. The results suggest that multifunction cubic pyrite-structure NiS2 & nbsp;nanospheres that anchors effectively and catalysis is beneficial to the large-scale application for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Nitrogen-coordinated mononuclear metal moieties (MNx moities) are bio-inspired active sites that are analogous to various metal-porphyrin cofactors. Given that the functions of metal-porphyrin cofactors are highly dependent on the local coordination environments around the mononuclear active site, engineering MNx active sites in heterogeneous M-N-C catalysts would provide an additional degree of freedom for boosting their electrocatalytic activity. This work presents a local coordination structure modification of FeN4 moieties via morphological engineering of graphene support. Introducing highly wrinkled structure in graphene matrix induces nonplanar distortion of FeN4 moieties, resulting in the modification of electronic structure of mononuclear Fe. Electrochemical analysis combined with first-principles calculations reveal that enhanced electrocatalytic lithium polysulfide conversion, especially the Li2S redox step, is attributed to the local structure modified FeN4 active sites, while increased specific surface area also contributes to improved performance at low C-rates. Owing to the synergistic combination of atomic-level modified FeN4 active sites and morphological advantage of graphene support, Fe-N-C catalysts with wrinkled graphene morphology show superior lithium-sulfur battery performance at both low and high C-rates (particularly 915.9 mAh g(-1) at 5 C) with promising cycling stability.

Herein, by a facile solvent method followed by nitridation with NH3, a 2D nitrogen-doped carbon structure is designed with homogeneously embedded Co4N nanoparticles derived from metal organic framework (MOF), grown on the carbon cloth (MOF-Co4N). Experimental results and theoretical simulations reveal that Co4N nanoparticles act as strong chemical adsorption hosts and catalysts that not only improve the cycling performance of Li-S batteries via chemical bonding to trap polysulfides but also improve the rate performance through accelerating the conversion reactions by decreasing the polarization of the electrode. In addition, the high conductive nitrogen-doped carbon matrix ensures fast charge transfer, while the 2D structure offers increased pathways to facilitate ion diffusion. Under the current density of 0.1C, 0.5C, and 3C, MOF-Co4N delivers reversible specific capacities of 1425, 1049, and 729 mAh g(-1), respectively, and retains 82.5% capacity after 400 cycles at 1C, as compared to the sample without Co4N (MOF-C) values of 61.3% (200 cycles). The improved cell performance corroborates the validity of the multifunctional design of MOF-Co4N, which is expected to be a potentially promising cathode host for Li-S batteries.

However, the self-aggregation of CNTs often makes them fail to effectively inhibit the shuttling effect of soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates. Herein, a type of ultra-stable carbon micro/nano-scale interconnected "carbon cages" has been designed by incorporating polar acid-treated carbon fibers (ACF) into three-dimensional (3D) CNT frameworks during vacuum filtration processes. Results show that the ACF-CNT composite frameworks possess a reinforced-concrete-like structure, in which the ACFs can well work as the main mechanical supporting frames for the composite electrodes, and the oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) formed on them as cross linker between ACFs and CNTs. Benefitted from this design, the ACF-CNT/S cathodes deliver an excellent rate capability (retain 72.6% at 4C). More impressively, the ACF-CNT/S cathodes also show an ultrahigh cycling stability (capacity decay rate of 0.001% per cycle over 350 cycles at 2C). And further optimization suggests that the suitable treatment on CFs could balance the chemical adsorption (OFGs) and physical confinement (carbon cages), leading to fast and durable electrochemical reaction dynamics. In addition, the assembled soft pack LSBs further show a high dynamic bending stability. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the capacity decay mainly caused by the polysulfides shuttle effect and poor conductivity of sulfur. Herein, in situ growth of ZnCo2O4 quantum dots (ZCO-QDs) embedded into the hollow carbon-carrier sphere (HCS) to form the ZnCo2O4 quantum dots nanocapsule (ZCO-QDs@HCS) as the multifunctional sulfur host is rationally demonstrated. Based on density-functional theory calculations, in situ spectroscopic techniques, and electrochemical studies, the synergistic effects on anchoring/catalyzing polysulfide of the ZCO-QDs@HCS composite in Li-S batteries is investigated. Interestingly, the ZCO-QDs@HCS also allows for the controlled release of ZCO-QDs into the Li-S electrolyte. Subsequently, it is first discovered that these diffused ZCO-QDs can act as self-repairing initiators to stabilize Li metal anodes via rebuilding the damaged solid electrolyte interphase and suppressing Li dendrites growth. With this concept, quantum dots-based catalyst delivery systems is first constructed in a Li-S battery, which is similar to the use of nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems in cancer therapy. The Li-S cells with the S@ZCO-QDs@HCS cathode display significantly superior electrochemical performances with a high specific capacity (1350.5 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.1 C) and excellent cycling stability (capacity decay rate of 0.057% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 3.0 C).

Exploring new electrocatalyst with strong catalytic ability can greatly accelerate the conversion of polysulfides in Li-S batteries. Herein, BiOI/carbon fibers (BiOI/CFs) core-shell composite has been prepared by a facile electrospinning combined with solvothermal method and used as a promising electrocatalyst. The BiOI nanosheets are cross-linked to form a porous three-dimensional network on the surface of carbon fibers. This architecture not only has the advantage of large aspect ratio, but also has a high specific surface area, which provides abundant active sites and ensures high electron/ion transfer for the electrocatalysis of lithium polysulfides. As expected, BiOI/CFs electrode presents a superior bidirectional oxidation-reduction ability for polysulfides. The first-principles calculations also prove the strong interaction between BiOI and polysulfides. Due to these advantages, BiOI/CFs can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides, and possesses excellent electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries. The specific capacity of the BiOI/CFs-S electrode is stable at 1020 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C and 598 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 5C. This work provides new insights for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for polysulfide conversion.

However, very limited studies have focused on keeping these parameters at practically desirable ranges. Here, we present a lithium-sulfur cell with a coaxial-graphene-coated cotton-carbon (CGCC) cathode that displays excellent performance with high sulfur loading (57.6 mg cm(-2)), high sulfur content (75 wt %), and low E/S ratio (4.2 mu L mg(-1)) simultaneously. The cell exhibits high areal capacity (31 mA hr cm(-2)) and areal energy density (66 mW hr cm(-2)) that exceed the areal capacity (4 mA hr cm(-2)) and areal energy density (10 mW hr cm(- 2)) of a commercial LiCoO2 cathode with a high capacity-retention rate of 68% over 200 cycles.

However, the dissolution of polysulfide in the electrodes results in shuttle effect and rapid fading of capacity, which impedes practical application of lithium sulfur battery. To inhibit the shuttle effect, in this work, an integrated, highly conductive metal-organic-framework-derived porous nitrogen-carbon-cobalt (N-C-Co) interlayer is designed and prepared to suppress polysulfides lost in electrolyte. Owing to the novel MOFs precursor, N-C-Co composite possesses hierarchical pores, pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen groups. This coating interlayer acts effectively through three aspects: as a physical blocking layer to prevent most polysulfides from dissolving out of the cathode, physical and chemical adsorption to confine free polysulfides in the electrolyte, and a second pseudo-upper current collector to enhance the utilization of sulfur. As a result, the improvement of battery performance is achieved by the well-designed interlayer. The initial discharge capacity of composite cathode with the interlayer is 1216.9 mAh g(-1) at 1C and can retain capacity of 660.3 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at the sulfur loading of 1.5 mg cm(-2). At the same time, the Coulombic efficiency maintains above 99% during cycling, demonstrating an effective inhibition of the shuttle effect. Even at a high sulfur mass loading of 5.2 mg cm(-2), the battery can still deliver 678.8 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles and an areal discharge capacity is of above 3.53 mAh cm(-2).

However, the demands of high sulfur content in composite, high sulfur loading in electrode, and low electrolyte usage are likely excessive for reaching both high gravimetric and volumetric capacities of sulfur cathode with conventional inactive hosts of sulfur. Herein, in order to effectively drive the conversion of sulfur, niobium tungsten oxide (Nb18W16O93) microspheres are adopted as electroactive host in the similiar electrochemical window to sulfur. As expected, Nb18W16O93 shows good electrochemical activity for lithium storage, and strong adsorption toward polysulfides. In particular, the in-situ electrochemically lithiated oxide in the discharge process can serve as good electrocatalyst and lithium-transfer bridge, facilitating the conversion of both the solid sulfur and soluble polysulfides. Correspondingly, the new lithium-transfer mechanism on Nb18W16O93 endows the sulfur cathode a high areal capacity (19.19 mAh cm(-2)) under both high sulfur loading (16.94 mg cm(-2)) and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (4.5 mu L mg(-1)). In addition, the sulfur-based composite with high tap density (1.56 g cm(-3)) shows a desired volumetric capacity (1605.3 mAh cm(-composite)(-3)), almost 1.9 times of that for the conventional S/carbon composite. This work provides a new perspective for understanding the electroactive hosts in lithium-sulfur battery.

Herein, we firstly add a novel type of electrolyte additive, biological reagents dithiothreitol (DTI), into the traditional electrolyte of Li-S batteries to suppress the "shuttle effect". DTT is able to be stabilized in original electrolyte system at room temperature and selectively slice the-S-S-bonds of polysulfides. The electrochemical studies reveal DTT significantly accelerate the reactions kinetic in cycle process and thus effectively inhibit the shuttling of polysulfides. As a result, the hierarchical porous carbon/S cathode using the electrolyte with 10 g L-1 DTT exhibits a high rate performance (570 mA h g(-1) improved from 317 mAh g(-1) at 3 C), a high initial discharge capacity (808 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C), and a superior cyclic stability (a low capacity fading rate of 0.025% per cycle over 500 cycles at 2 C). This strategy provides a new direction for achieving high energy density Li-S batteries and thus facilitating their practical application from the point of improving the kinetic sluggishness by electrolyte additive.

Nevertheless, the notorious "shuttle effect" and sluggish kinetic conversion in actual operation seriously hamper its practical application. Herein, inspired by the action mechanism of vulcanization accelerators, dipentamethylenethiuram tetrasulfide (DPTT) is employed as a novel electrolyte additive. Just like a scavenger, DPTT sweeps lithium polysulfide by a spontaneous instant chemical reaction between them, and the latter is quickly converted to Li2S2, along with the generation of elemental S, which will be reduced to polysulfide again. This is beneficial for relieving the accumulation and shuttling of polysulfide in the electrolyte. Therefore, Li-S batteries with DPTT-containing electrolyte exhibit enhanced capacity retention and improved rate performance. With 4 wt % DPTT additive and 3.03 mg cm(-2) S loading, the cell delivers a high initial capacity of 1227.6 mA h g(-1) and excellent capacity retention of 914.7 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.5 C. This study provides a fresh insight into suppressing the shuttle effect and realizing high-performance Li-S batteries.

The composition analysis and structure characteristic of NSHPC sample are measured by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectra. The electrochemical performances are measured by galvanotactic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. The results show that the NSHPC sample with unique honeycomb-like micro/mesoporous structure possesses high specific surface area of 2543.8 m(2) g(-1) and large pore volume of 2.14 cm(3) g(-1). The charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of the LSBs with the NSHPC flexible interlayer is much smaller than that of the LSBs with only Celgard separator. The pure sulfur cathode using NSHPC flexible interlayer can exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 1549 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. The good cycle performance and high discharge capacity are mainly owing to the honeycomb-like porous structure and the electrostatic repulsion between lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and nitrogen and sulfur dual-doping of NSHPC flexible interlayers. The using of NSHPC flexible interlayer to modify the Celgard separator can availably reduce the charge transfer resistance and increase electrostatic repulsion to LiPSs, and further enhancing the performance of LSBs.

In this way, the active material of the electrode (which is sulfur in the initial state) is limited to Li2S8 and Li2S3, leading the electrochemical reactions to take place in the liquid phase and thereby improving the capacity performance and cycling performance. After 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1 mA cm (2), the specific capacity obtained using a narrow electrochemical window (1.95-2.45 V) (490 mAh g (1)) was greater than that obtained using a wide electrochemical window (1.7-2.8 V) (435 mAh g (1)). This finding demonstrates the feasibility of improving the electrochemical performance by employing a suitable electrochemical window to restrain the phase transformation to the middle liquid phase.

However, during long circulation of lithium-sulfur battery, the inherent polysulfides shuttle effect and the stagnant electrochemical reaction kinetics of lithium polysulfides impede its commercial application. Herein, a bimetallic doping strategy of Fe/Co-C3N4/C is proposed to alleviate shuttle effect and improve electrochemical performance. Owing to high conductivity and large specific surface area as well as abundant active site of Fe/Co-C3N4/C, Fe/Co-C3N4/C/S can boost the adsorption and conversion capability for lithium polysulfides, and thus catalyzing the step-by-step reaction of polysulfides and accelerating the electrode reaction kinetics. It has been found that the lithiumsulfur battery employing Fe/Co-C3N4/C/S as cathode with the sulfur loading of 1.8 mg cm(-2) can deliver an initial specific capacity of 949 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, and maintain a reversible specific capacity of 749 mAh g(-1) after 135 cycles with a slow attenuation rate of 0.156% per cycle. Therefore, this bimetallic doping strategy provides a significant exploration for the design of cathode materials of advance high-performance lithium sulfur battery. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, serious problems such as poor rate performance and cycle stability are exposed during the scaling up of the sulfur loading. Systematic modification of both the cathode and separator has the potential to address these issues by enhancing the adsorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Herein, sulfur-deficient metallic 1T-MoS2 nanoflowers decorated graphene (FM@G) is proposed to be systematically modified on both cathode and separator. The as-developed cell exhibits superior cyclability with a capacity retention of 71.7% over 500 cycles. Importantly, steady cyclability and high volumetric capacity of 1360 mAh cm(-3) with a high sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2) are also attained even at high current density of 4.27 mA cm(-2). The electrochemical performance is comparable to or even superior to the state-of-the-art carbon-based sulfur batteries. This work provides valuable guidance for the implementation of high-energy-density Li-S batteries furnished with high sulfur loading.

Herein, the hollow titanium nitride (TiN)/1T-MoS2 heterostructure nanospheres are designed with efficient electrocatalysis properties serving as a sulfur host, which is formed by in situ electrochemical intercalation from TiN/2H-MoS2. Metallic, few-layered 1T-MoS2 nanosheets with abundant active sites decorated on TiN nanospheres enable fast electron transfer, high adsorption ability toward polysulfides, and favorable catalytic activity contributing to the conversion kinetics of polysulfides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of these favorable features, the as-developed hollow TiN/1T-MoS2 nanospheres with advanced architecture design can achieve a high discharge capacity of 1273 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, good rate performance with a capacity retention of 689 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, and long cycling stability with a low-capacity fading rate of 0.051% per cycle at 1 C for 800 cycles. Notably, the TiN/1T-MoS2/S cathode with a high sulfur loading of up to 7 mg cm(-2) can also deliver a high capacity of 875 mAh g(-1) for 50 cycles at 0.1 C. This work promotes the prospect application for TiN/1T-MoS2 in lithium-sulfur batteries.

The treated carbon paper was prepared by an alcohol-alkaline/thermal treatment of a commercial Toray carbon paper, introducing hydroxyl functional groups and micro-cracks on the carbon fibers in the carbon paper, which enhances the hydrophilicity and increases surface areas of the carbon paper matrix. The modified Li-S cells deliver a higher initial capacity of 1651 mAh g(-1) at 1.5-2.8 V at a rate of C/5 compared to the cells without any interlayer or with an untreated carbon paper interlayer. The cells with the treated carbon paper offer additional improvement in performance when the discharge cut-off voltage is raised to 1.8 V: 1057, 1002, and 929 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, respectively, at C/5, C/2, and 1 C rates. The improved cell performance is attributed to the 3D architecture of the carbon paper interlayer, serving as a conductive skeleton for trapping and depositing dissolved sulfur-containing active materials, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The novel configuration presented here offers a low-cost approach to overcome the persistent problems of Li-S cells.

It offers a significant specific capacity of 1675 mAh/g and high-energy density (2600 Wh/kg). In this work, sulfur/MnO2/graphene oxide (GO) composite has been prepared by incorporating sulfur in different ratios with MnO2 and GO (10:20 and 20:10; SMG1 and SMG2) by solid state reaction and used as cathode for Li-S battery. The obtained composites have been characterized for physical and electrochemical performances. The XRD spectrum display the sulfur is in orthorhombic structure and the presence of carbon has been confirmed by Raman analysis. The SMG2 composite with 70 wt% of sulfur displays a considerably embellished cycling performance (1610 mAh/g at an initial cycle at 0.1 C). The capacity and stability of the material is achieved by suppressing the polysulfides effectively. Low capacity fade, accommodation of volume change arising during cycling processes makes this positive electrode material competent for Li-S battery application.

However, the shuttle effect seriously limits its practical use. Herein, hollow tubular graphene-like carbon nitride (Tg-C3N4) is synthesized and utilized as a functional interlayer to inhibit shuttling effect and promote catalytic kinetics. Both experiments and DFT calculations together suggest that N-doping enhances the electron transfers between Tg-C3N4 and LiPSs, leading to improved chemical adsorptions and catalytic effects towards the redox conversions of the active sulfur species. Besides, Tg-C3N4 delivers a unique hollow tubular architecture with massive ion transfer pathways and fully exposed active interfaces. In addition, the abundant C-N heteroatomic structures also impose strong chemical immobilization toward lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from these unique superiorities, the cell with the Tg-C3N4-modified separator exhibits a reversible capacity of 494 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C with a negligible capacity decay of 0.085% per cycle, indicating an efficient strategy toward high-performance modified separators.

However, the shuttling of soluble polysulfides between the cathode and the anode and the consequent lithium anode degradation strongly limit the safety and electrochemical performance in the Li-S battery. Herein, a metal-organic-framework (MOF)-modified gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is employed in a Li-S battery in order to stablize the lithium anode. In view of the abundant pores in the MOF skeleton, the as-prepared GPE not only immobilizes the large-size polysulfide anions but also cages electrolyte anions into the pores, thus facilitating a uniform flux of Li ions and homogeneous Li deposition. Cooperated with a sulfur-carbon composite cathode, the lithium with MOF-modified GPE exhibits a uniform surface morphology and dense solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, thus delivering good cycle stability and high-rate capability.

Herein, uniform mesoporous MnO2 nanospheres were prepared using a facile self-assembly and room-temperature reaction method. As a sulfur carrier of sulfur cathodes, the versatile architecture of MnO2 not only provides powerful chemical adsorption to anchor polysulfide intermediates on the large polar surface area but also restrains them within the nanopores by physical confinement. The mesoporous MnO2-stabilized sulfur cathode demonstrates a high initial reversible capacity of 1349.3 mA h g(-1) and a capacity fading rate of 0.073% at 1.0 C over 500 cycles. Furthermore, a reversible areal capacity of 2.5 mA h cm(-2) was achieved with stable cycling performance at a sulfur content of 80.7%. Our work offers a facile method to build efficient sulfur cathodes for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

J	Wu, L; Wang, ZF; An, CH; He, G				Wu, Lan; Wang, Zhifeng; An, Cuihua; He, Guang			Chemical-dealloying to fabricate nonconductive interlayers for high-loading lithium sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Chemical dealloying; Nanoporous materials; Lithium-sulfur batteries; High sulfur loading; Nonconductive interlayers	TIO2 NANOPARTICLES; CARBON PAPER; SEPARATOR; CATHODES; NETWORKS; HOST; XPS	Lithium sulfur batteries have been recognized as a promising on-board energy-storage technology. One of the challenges in this system is the efficient inhibition of polysulfides shuttle with the low-cost sulfur hosts. In this work, we report the fabrication of nanoporous CeO2 and TiO2 by a novel chemical dealloying approach as a thin nonconductive interlayer to confine polysulfides in the cathodes. The abundant pores provide channels for the transportation of electrolyte, whereas the dissolved polysulfide species are chemically interacted with the metal oxides. Between the two interlayers, CeO2 demonstrates superior performance over TiO2, which is attributed to the appropriate redox window of the Ce3+/Ce4+ couple to in-situ catalyse the polysulfides. The cells with such a configuration exhibit significantly enhanced capacities and long-term stability. Even at a high sulfur loading of 6mg cm(-2), it is demonstrated stable capacities of similar to 600 mAh g(-1) over 120 cycles. These results suggest chemical dealloying is an efficient approach to prepare desired nanoporous interlayers to achieve practical cycling performance with a commercial sulfur host.

Nevertheless, a few technical issues pose a significant challenge on the path to industrial applications, namely, capacity fade and Coulombic efficiency decay, which are inherent in the soluble polysulfide shuttle effect during charge/discharge cycling. Carbon materials which have excellent conductive scaffold and flexible structure with a variety of morphologies can serve as a remedy to this issue. Herein, with a well-designed melt-diffusion procedure, we prepared three carbon-based sulfur-embedded cathodes with diverse structures [graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and flake graphite]. Sulfur loading varies between 60 and 73 wt %. Among these three carbon/S cathodes, beyond 100 cycles, the graphene/S cathode showed a discharge capacity of 840 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) current density and its average Coulombic efficiency was above 99.4%, demonstrating the best cycle stability and reversibility. While at a higher current rate, 1 A g(-1), CNT/S reaches the best capacity of 518 mA h g(-1) among these three cathodes, revealing excellent sulfur utilization under high rate conditions. The X-ray photo spectroscopy shows evidence for chemical bonding between graphene/CNTs surfaces and carbonyl, hydroxyl, and ether groups, resulting in well-confined polysulfides in the cathode side, which significantly restrain the movement of soluble polysulfide in the charging process and efficiently decreases the capacity fading of sulfur. This unique structure is a potential explanation for the outstanding electrochemical performance.

In this paper, we obtain a type of KOH activated sucrose carbonization coated V2O5 as sulfur immobilizers. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectrum tests illustrate that after carbon coating and sulfur loading, the V2O5 has been transformed into low valence vanadium oxide (VO2) and carbon has a high defect concentration after KOH activated. Scanning electron microscopy observes that the micromorphology of V2O5@C matrix materials with the ratio of V2O5 and sucrose to 1:3 shows a rose-like shape and lamellar thickness can be controlled below 100 nm. And after sulfur loading, the morphology of the original matrix material can still be maintained even at sulfur loading mass ratio to 1:5. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests show that this cathode in the proportions of V2O5@C and S to 1:4 has the greatest superb electrochemical reversibility and the fastest electron transport rate. Charge and discharge tests show that the initial specific discharge capacities can respectively achieve to 831.54, 736.95 and 670.00 mAh.g(-1) at 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2C current rate and can be stable 100 charge and discharge cycles at 0.2C.

However, the complexity and high cost of fabrication prohibit their extensive promotion and application. In this study, a three-dimensional porous carbon skeleton (3DPCS) has been successfully synthesized from low-cost raw materials by a template-free method without any post-activation process. The 3DPCS/S-60 (60 wt % sulfur content) composite exhibits a high initial capacity of 1623 mA h g(-1)(96.9% of theoretical value) at 0.1 C. Benefiting from the abundant hierarchical pores and highly conductive networks, the 3DPCS can be loaded with 90 wt % sulfur, which displays an initial capacity of 889.7 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and a slow capacity attenuation ratio of 0.06% per cycle during 1000 charge/discharge tests. Besides, even at an areal sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2) , the 3DPCS/S-80 (80 wt % sulfur content) cathode exhibits an initial capacity of 1256.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and retains 854.7 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles.

However, most of reported sulfur electrodes are not competent to realize the fast conversion of polysulfides into insoluble lithium sulfides when applied with high sulfur loading, as well as to mitigate the more serious shuttle effect of polysulfides, especially when worked at an elevated temperature. Herein, we reported a unique structural engineering strategy of crafting a unique hierarchical multifunctional electrode architecture constructed by rooting MOF-derived CoS2/carbon nanoleaf arrays (CoS2-CNA) into a nitrogen-rich 3D conductive scaffold (CTNF@CoS2-CNA) for LSBs. An accelerated electrocatalytic effect and improved polysulfide redox kinetics arising from CoS2-CNA were investigated. Besides, the strong capillarity effect and chemisorption of CTNF@CoS2-CNA to polysulfides enable high loading and efficient utilization of sulfur, thus leading to high-performance LIBs performed not only at room temperature but also up to an elevated temperature (55 degrees C). Even with the ultrahigh sulfur loading of 7.19 mg cm(-2), the CTNF@CoS2-CNA/S cathode still exhibits high rate capacity at 55 degrees C.

Herein, we report a double-layered MOF-PAN/rGO-PAN nanofiber membrane as an alternative to commercial polyolefin separators for Li-S battery. This PAN-based membrane possesses the intrinsic advantages of good mechanical property, thermal stability and high electrolyte uptake, showing a high lithium ion transference number of 0.81. The in situ grown MOF particles by low pressure chemical vapor deposition attach on the surface of the nanofibers tightly, and these exposed particles can maximize the utilization for trapping polysulfides through chemisorption. With this novel functional separator, the Li-S batteries can provide a high initial capacity of 1302 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C. At a high rate of 5 C, the capacity decay rate is only 0.03% per cycle over 600 cycles. More importantly, even with a high sulfur loading of 7.7 mg cm(-2), the Li-S battery is able to deliver a high areal capacity of 7.8 mAh cm(-2) after 50 cycles.

However, their intrinsic problems hinder their implementation into the marketplace. The most pronounced problems are the parasitic reactions which occur between lithium polysulfides species and lithium metal anode, the volume expansion of sulfur (80%) at the end of discharge and the safety issues which are linked with the use of lithium metal. Herein this work, two approaches are applied to prevent these effects; one approach is the use of Li2S as cathode material, instead of starting from sulfur powder, both to circumvent the volume expansion of sulfur taking place during discharge and to enable lithium free anodes cell assembling (i.e. Si-Li2S or Sn-Li2S cell configurations). Second approach deals with the lithium anode protection by SnO2 containing freestanding pyrolyzed bacterial cellulose interlayers located between anode and cathode electrodes. Since bacterial celluloses are formed in the presence of SnO2 nanoparticles, the resulting structure enables intimate contact between carbon and SnO2 nanoparticles. By employing Li2S cathode and freestanding interlayer concurrently, 468 mAh g(-1) discharge capacity is obtained at C/10 current density over 100 cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the low sulfur loading, low active material utilization, and poor cycling stability restrict their commercial applications. Herein, we prepared a three-dimensional structure of SnS2 nanoplates decorated on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (3D SnS2@N-CNFs) by an electrospinning process followed by a hydrothermal technique. The 3D freestanding SnS2@N-CNFs were applied as the current collector and polymeric binder containing a Li2S6 catholyte for lithium polysulfide batteries. The obtained SnS2@N-CNFs show the strong physicochemical adsorption of polysulfides and can effectively reduce the electrochemical polarization. The cell with SnS2@N-CNFs exhibits high electrochemical performance. As a result, SnS2@N-CNFs with high sulfur loading of approximately 7.11 mg displayed the first discharge capacity of 1010 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with 0.08% capacity decay per cycle over 150 cycles. Meanwhile, the electrode with sulfur loading up to 22.65 mg also exhibits an extremely high capacity of 14.67 mAh, much higher than commonly presented blade-cast sulfur electrodes. The fibrous membrane is promising for assembling with high sulfur loading, which exhibits a superior electrochemical performance in lithium sulfur batteries.

However, electrolyte-soluble polysulfides cause a shuttle effect and lead to poor cycle stability. This is one of the main obstacles to the practical applications of LSB technology. To overcome this problem, here, we report polar Ni2P hollow microspheres, with multilayer nesting, as sulfur host materials. Specifically, the multilayer polar Ni2P can simultaneously act as a multilayer physical barrier and chemical adsorption material. In addition, the Ni2P microspheres serve as activation catalysts, accelerating the redox reaction kinetics. The above features allow the structure to effectively suppress the shuttle effect and improve the discharge capacity and cycle stability of LSB. For example, the three-dimensional printed Ni2P@S (3DP-Ni2P@S) cathode can provide an initial capacity of 682 mAh/g, obtaining high cycle stability with low-capacity attenuation of 0.0072% per cycle for 400 cycles under 2C. Even when the sulfur loading is increased from 6.1 to 9.3 mg/cm(2), this material still shows good capacity retention. This work inspires the design of multifunctional cathode materials and paves a new path for the development of Li-S batteries.

To solve these issues, finding novel catalytic hosts and strategies to facilitate polysulfide redox reaction is gaining much importance nowadays. Herein, we report oxidation-state-controlled amorphous FePO4 as an effective catalytic host for polysulfide conversion for the first time. For this study, we fabricated the FePO4-embedded 3D graphene composite by facile hydrothermal reaction and tailored the ratio of Fe2+/Fe3+ in the amorphous FePO4 by a thermal treatment in the reducing H-2 atmosphere. A series of electrochemical tests showed that the mixed-valence FePO4 demonstrates enhanced catalytic ability than Fe3+-dominant FePO4. Surface and bandgap analyses indicate that such enhanced kinetics of mixed-valence FePO4 is attributed to the combined effects of promoted electron conduction and chemical interaction. By introducing mixed-valence FePO4 into the cathode, the battery showed robust cyclability delivering an excellent capacity of 784 mAh & BULL;g(-1)& nbsp;& nbsp;at 1C after 300 cycles (retained capacity of ~ 78%) and superior rate performance exhibiting over 872 mAh & BULL;g(-1) at a high rate of 2C.

Especially, the generally slow electrocatalytic sulfur redox kinetics and large interfacial Li2S nucleation energy barriers have hindered the widespread application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a robust three-dimensional sulfur carrier (denoted as Co-NCNT) is well-constructed using the potassium citrate derived porous carbon sheets as substrate and the catalytic growth nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanotubes as vertical scaffolds. Such a rationally designed structure guarantees efficient electron transfer pathways and ions diffusion channels. More importantly, it is conducive to the adsorption/catalytic conversion of intermediate lithium polysulfides and the nucleation of Li2S. Due to these merits, the S@Co-NCNT cathode achieves an initial discharge capacity up to 1072.7 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C, and it can retain a high capacity of 482.9 mAh g(-1) with a capacity attenuation rate of only 0.045% per cycle after 1000 cycles. Upon a high sulfur loading of 5.87 mg cm(-2), the S@Co-NCNT electrode can still reach an initial capacity of 739.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.3 C. Particular emphasis is that our work broadens the way to prepare well-designed carbonaceous materials sulfur host for long-life Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, the hydrangea-shaped Co0.85Se electrocatalyst with macroporous architecture is synthesized. Besides, to improve the electronic conductivity of Co0.85Se, some defects (S-doped) are introduced into the structure of crystals. The S-doped Co0.85Se exhibited an outstanding electrocatalytic effect on lithium polysulfides conversion and can induce and regulate uniform growth of insoluble Li2S on its surface due to the synergistic adsorption by Se and S. As a result, the S/C cathode achieved a high initial capacity of 1340.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and a stable cycling capacity of 666.6 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles by 5 wt% Co0.85SeS additions. Moreover, high S loading cathodes are designed through in situ synthesis of Co0.85SeS on flexible carbon cloth (Co0.85SeS@CC). The porous and open framework of Co0.85SeS@CC facilitated electrolyte infiltration and accommodated the volume change of sulfur during the charge/discharge process. Taking by these advantages, a high areal capacity of 9.663 mAh cm(-2) is achieved at a high sulfur loading of 9.98 mg cm(-2). Even at a high current density of 15 mA cm(-2), a reversible capacity of 603.7 mAh g(-1) is maintained at a sulfur loading of 6.52 mg cm(-2).

The cathode material shows the highest discharge capacity of 1158.2 mAh g(-1) at the pore size of 4.1 nm among as-prepared nitrogen-free materials with different sizes.

Herein, a bifunctional Ni/Zn dual-doped CoSe2 is designed to enhance the catalytic effect of CoSe2. Specifically, Ni functions better in catalyzing the conversion of LiPSs into Li2S with shorter Co-S bond and longer S-S bonds than Zn, while Zn demonstrates a better catalytic effect for Li2S decomposition with reduced Li2S decomposition barrier and elongated Li-S bonds than Ni. Those endows Ni/Zn dual-doped CoSe2 with bifunction in catalyzing conversion reaction of LiPSs and Li2S precipitation as well as the decomposition of Li2S, originating from the modified molecular structure of LiPSs and Li2S. As a result, the sulfur cathode with Ni0.1Zn0.1Co0.8Se2 achieves a rate capability of 681.74 mAh g(-1) at 2C, and a cycling stability for 400 cycles with a decay rate of 0.065%. This work provides an effective way to improve catalytic effect of transition metal compounds for advanced LSBs by homogenous dual doping.

Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman and some other techniques were used to characterize the as-prepared N-O-E-CNTs, which possessed enhanced specific surface area and pore volume, and excellent conductivity. The N-O-E-CNTs were investigated as carbon host for Li-S batteries by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance, and the electrochemical testing showed that the N-O-E-CNTs/S cathode presented much better cyclability and rate capability than the carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/S and open-ended carbon nanotubes (O-E-CNTs)/S cathodes. The main reasons for the improved performance were explained as follows. On one hand, the controllable chemical cutting for CNTs can effectively increase the specific surface area and pore volume while retaining good conductivity, and the formed open-ended structure is beneficial to trapping sulfur species in the internal nanotube cavity. On the other hand, the N doping for the N-O-E-CNTs can not only recover the conductivity, but also enable the N-O-E-CNTs to possess more superior compatibility and adsorbability for sulfur species, resulting in high utilization of active material and effective alleviation of polysulfides shuttling.

Here a facile hydrothermal method was used to synthesize the NG and then the composite of NG and SWCNT (NG/SWCNT) was obtained by mixing with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) via a simple ultrasonic method. Finally, the NG/SWCNT-sulfur composite (NG/SWCNT-S) is synthesized via an isothermal method that enables rapid vapor infiltration of sulfur into carbon nanotubes. The resulting sulfur-containing cathode shows a good capacity performance, reaching high initial capacities of 1199.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 725.2 mAh g(-1) at 1 C. The optimized electrochemical performance can be attributed to the NG addition which leads to an effective improvement of sulfur utilization and seizing polysulfides during cycling. Moreover, we show that the vapor infiltration method based on the thermodynamics of capillary condensation on nanoscale surfaces offers a new idea for assembling cathode, compared to the traditional melt infiltration method.

Brunauer-Emmett-Teller tests indicated that the surface area and total pore volume (at P/P-o) of the GPC/HT are 4220 m(2)g(-1) and 2.02 cm(3)g(-1), higher than those of the GPC (2290 m(2)g(-1) and 1.02 cm(3)g(-1)). The GPC/HT-S with a sulfur content of 87.6 wt.% exhibited a higher initial specific capacity (1087 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C) and better cycle retention (72.2% after 400 cycles at 0.5 C) than those of the GPC-S (65.3%). Optimized sulfur content was investigated to overcome the problems for shuttle phenomenon and low conductivity. Among the investigated samples (sulfur content of 65.3, 87.6, and 95.1 wt.%), the GPC/HT-S with 87.6 wt.% exhibited the best electrochemical performance. The enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the improved specific surface area of the GPC/HT and proper sulfur loading content, which effectively facilitated the intimate contact between sulfur and conductive carbon matrix and physically confined lithium polysulfide intermediates. The result in this work is important for using low cost and mesoporous bio-waste carbon as carbon framework for sulfur encapsulating in Li-S batteries.

Nevertheless, there are still several disadvantages (sulfur insulation, insoluble lithium polysulfide, shuttle effect, etc.) impeding the commercial application of Li-S batteries. Recent studies have discovered that nanosized metal oxides can effectively modify the electrochemical properties of composite cathodes in Li-S batteries. In this paper, graphene aerogels (GA) loaded with different mass fractions of antimony tin oxide (ATO) nanoparticles were incorporated with sulfur and utilized as cathode materials for Li-S batteries. The sample (GA/ATO-3) loaded with 3 wt.% ATO nanoparticles showed the best electrochemical performance. For example, the specific discharge capacity of first cycle reached 1210 mA.h.g(-1) under a current of 0.1 C. The reversible discharge capacity was reduced to 545 mA.h.g(-1) after 50 cycles, namely, the corresponding capacity retention rate was approximately 50%. However, the coulombic efficiency was still near 100%. Potential modification mechanism was considered to be a combination between the GA with excellent conductivity, which effectively improved the internal conductivity of the cathode material, and the ATO nanoparticles, which improved the distribution uniformity of the solid sulfur and its sulfurized product because the ATO nanoparticles acted as heterogeneous nucleation points. Furthermore, the ATO nanoparticles with strong polarity possessed a strong capture ability on the soluble polysulfide ions. For the above reasons, the ATO-loaded GA cathode could effectively inhibit the "shuttle effect," thereby, improved the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

In this study, we present high-loading polysulfide cathodes using a series of carbon nanofibers that are generated from the carbonized electrospun nanofibers (CENFs). We fabricate the CENFs with similar porous fibrous skeleton decorating with tunable nanoporosity that allows us to explore the effect of nanoporosity on the electrochemical characteristics of the high-loading polysulfide cathodes. The CENF-polysulfide cathode made with non-nanoporous CENFs attains a high sulfur content of 71 wt% and loading of 14.4 mg cm-2, both of which exceed sulfur cathodes reported in the literature (<60 wt% and <3 mg cm-2). The high-loading CENFpolysulfide cathodes attain high reversible discharge capacities of 802 and 670 mA h g-1, high capacity retention rates of 82% after 200 cycles, and a long shelf life of 3 months at C/20 and C/10 rates, respectively. The cells further demonstrate high areal energy density values of 23.6 and 18.6 mW h cm-2 in a cell with a low electrolyteto-sulfur ratio of 4 mu L mg- 1 at C/20 and C/10 rates. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the porous CENFs with limited nanopores prevent the rapid consumption of electrolyte and enable high-loading polysulfide cathodes to maintain high electrochemical efficiency and stability.

Incorporation of polar metal oxides is an efficient addition for LSBs to suppress the dissolution of soluble polysulfides, increase the utilization of sulfur, and improve cycling stability. Herein, a model (MoO2/C-NCs) based on a porous octahedral carbon framework decorated with MoO2 nanoparticles (MoO2 NPs) as a sulfur host is proposed. Adsorption experiments of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to MoO2/C-NCs and cyclic voltammetry analysis showed that the MoO2 NPs facilitate interfacial charge transfer and provide numerous active sites for the electrochemical redox reactions of LiPSs. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that LiPSs are diffused and strongly adsorbed on the surface of MoO2 NPs because of the powerful van der Waals forces via Mo-S and Li-O bonds, which helps achieve a stable long-term cycling performance. As a result, the fabricated LSBs display a high initial specific capacity of 1317 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and a promising capacity of 602 mA h g(-1) and a capacity retention of 65.6% at 1C when proceeding to 500 cycles.

The Fe3C-N-rGO is coated on the surface of commercial polypropylene separator (Celgard 2400) close to the sulfur cathode. The special nanotubes are in-situ catalyzed by Fe3C nanoparticles. They could entrap lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to restrain the shuttle effect and reduce the loss of active material. The battery with the modified separator and sulfur cathode shows an excellent cycle performance. It has a high rate performance, 580.5 mAh/g at the high current rate of 4 C relative to 1075 mAh/g at 0.1 C. It also has an initial discharge capacity of 774.8 mAh/g measured at 0.5 C and remains 721.8 mAh/g after 100 cycles with a high capacity retention of 93.2%.

A ready-made conductive matrix infiltrated with sulfur as the cathode is the usual solution. Here, a partially reduced graphene oxide-sulfur composite (prGO/S) with an ordered self-assembled layer-by-layer structure is introduced as a Li-S battery cathode. The prGO/S composites are synthesized through a facile one-step self-assembly liquid route. An appropriate amount of sulfur is in situ deposited on the surface of the prGO nanosheets by adjusting the reduction degree of the GO nanosheets. The combined effect of the electrostatic repulsions and surface energy makes the sulfur wrapped prGO nanosheets self-assemble to form an ordered layer-by-layer structure, which not only ensures the uniform distribution of sulfur but also accommodates the volume change of the sulfur species during cycling. Moreover, the conductivity of the prGO/S composites improves when the reduction time increases. XPS spectra confirm that sulfur is still chemically bonded to the prGO. After applying the prGO coating of the prGO/S composite particle and as an interlayer in a lithium-sulfur battery configuration, a high initial discharge capacity of 1275.8 mA h g(-1) is achieved and the discharge capacity of the 100th cycle is 1013.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C rate.

However, the poor cycle stability hinders the further development of this battery system. In order to improve the stability of Li-S batteries, the diffusion of polysulfides from electrodes into electrolyte should be suppressed. Herein, we utilize a positively charged polyelectrolyte to functionalize the electrode materials with the aim to hamper the polysulfides dissolution via electrostatic interaction between strong positively charged polyelectrolyte and negatively charged polysulfides anion. The effect of the functionalization quantity of poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) and functionalization sequence on cycling performances is investigated in detail. It is found that the sulfur-graphene composite (SG) directly functionalized with 10 times PDDA exhibited best cycling stability. At a discharge current density of 0.2 C, much higher capacity retention was realized on the functionalized electrodes than the unfunctionalized (81% vs. 47.3%) after 120 cycles. The as-observed results demonstrate that the electrostatic interaction can effectively prolong the cycling life of Li-S batteries, which provides a new promising strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

In this work, accordion-like titanium oxides-Ti3C2 MXene (Ti3C2Ox) hetero-structure was synthesized via a fast annealing treatment to Ti3C2 MXene (Ti3C2) in air. Oxidation temperature plays a key role on the formation of accordion-like Ti3C2Ox. The synthesized Ti3C2Ox material under 500 degrees C exhibits the most optimal structure, which presents the evenly distributed titanium oxides on the Ti3C2 nanosheets. This heterostructural material combines the high chemical adsorption ability of titanium oxides for LiPSs and good electronic conductivity of Ti3C2. After infiltrating with sulfur, a substantial specific capacity of 662 mAh g(-1) is achieved after 1000 cycles at 1 C (1.675 A g(-1)), corresponding to a very low capacity fading of 0.053% per cycle. Additionally, a reversible capacity of 367 mAh g(-1) is still obtained at a high rate of 10 C. The Ti3C2Ox synthesized by the facile oxidation treatment is a highly promising electrode material and contributes to accelerate the practical use of Li-S battery.

Graphene microspheres (GMSs) with hierarchical porous architectures and high 3D electrical conductivities are highly expected to be the host carbon to accommodate sulfur cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein we reported the direct synthesis of GMSs assembled by 3D interconnected graphene with hierarchical pores by template chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on layered double oxide (LDO) microspheres. The LDO templates were derived from conformally calcined layered double hydroxide microspheres produced by spray drying. After methane-CVD, graphene was catalytically grown on LDO templates. Subsequent routine chemical etching of the LDO templates enabled as-obtained GMSs with a large diameter of ca. 11 mu m and a high surface area of 1275 m(2) g(-1). The GMS was employed as carbon scaffold to accommodate sulfur for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries. An initial areal discharge capacity of 2.67 mAh cm(-2) was obtained at a current density of 0.83 mA cm(-2) on flexible GMS paper electrode with an areal sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2).

However, unresolved detrimental low Li-ion transport rates in traditional carbon materials lead to large energy barrier in high sulfur loading batteries, which prevents the lithium-sulfur batteries from commercialization. In this report, to overcome the challenge of increasing both the cycling stability and areal capacity, a metallic oxide composite (NiCo2O4@rGO) is designed to enable a robust separator with low energy barrier for Li-ion diffusion and simultaneously provide abundant active sites for the catalytic conversion of the polar polysulfides. With a high sulfur-loading of 6 mg cm(-2) and low sulfur/electrolyte ratio of 10, the assembled batteries deliver an initial capacity of 5.04 mAh cm(-2) as well as capacity retention of 92% after 400 cycles. The metallic oxide composite NiCo2O4@rGO/PP separator with low Li-ion diffusion energy barrier opens up the opportunity for lithium-sulfur batteries to achieve long-cycle, cost-effective operation toward wide applications in electric vehicles and electronic devices.

This process results in sluggish redox kinetics at the interface of cathode/electrolyte and escaped LiPSs to electrolytes during long-term cycling. Herein, by advantageous functional integration of immobilization and conversion capability for LiPSs, a 3D aerogel with the composition of Co@CoO@N-doped carbon@graphene (Co@CoO@N-C/rGO) is designed and prepared. The dual-shells of N-C and polar CoO enable the strong chemical adsorption towards LiPSs through pyridinic - N-Li-bond and Co center dot center dot S coordination, respectively. And the conductive Co core acts as a "scissor", which catalyzes the transformation of adsorbed LiPSs into low-order ones, thus accelerating the kinetics of the liquid-solid nucleation and growth of Li2S. Moreover, the matrix of rGO serves as electrical networks, significantly promoting the transfer of electrons to the redox-active sites. Based on these synergetic effects, the LSB using Co@CoO@N-C/rGO modified separators exhibits out-standing electrochemical performance. For example, even at a rate of 1C, the cell still delivers a stable capacity of 555.4 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles for a pure sulfur electrode. Moreover, the relevant kinetic mechanisms including in situ Raman test are expounded in detail.

However, Li-S batteries often suffer from fast capacity decay, low energy density and short lifespan due to the shuttle effect from polysulfides. Hybridizing sulfur with carbonaceous materials has been demonstrated effective in solving these challenges and thus improving Li-S battery performance. In this work, yeast as a low-cost, natural and renewable catalyst was used to grow carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which were then coated on the separator in a Li-S battery to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The Li-S cell with the CNT-coated separator exhibited significantly improved performance at high current density with an initial high specific capacity of 980 mA h g(-1) and a well-retained specific capacity of similar to 450 mA h g(-1) after 850 cycles at a high current density.

Here, the synthesis of 3D hyperbranched hollow carbon nanorod encapsulated sulfur nanocomposites as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries is reported. The sulfur nanocomposite cathodes deliver a high specific capacity of 1378 mAh g(-1) at a 0.1C current rate and exhibit stable cycling performance. The as-prepared sulfur nanocomposites also achieve excellent high rate capacities and cyclability, such as 990 mAh g(-1) at 1C, 861 mAh g(-1) at 5C, and 663 mAh g(-1) at 10C, extending to more than 500 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance are ascribed to the unique 3D hyperbranched hollow carbon nanorod architectures and high length/radius aspect ratio of the carbon nanorods, which can effectively prevent the dissolution of polysulfides, decrease self-discharge, and confine the volume expansion on cycling. High capacity, excellent high-rate performance, and long cycle life render the as-developed sulfur/carbon nanorod nanocomposites a promising cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Pd3Co particles on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are synthesized by using a modified polyol method. The synthesis of Pd3Co on MWCNTs is confirmed by Xray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The interlayer film is prepared through a filtration method using these powders. Li-S batteries with this interlayer have electrochemical properties superior to those with an MWCNT interlayer (0.2, 0.5, and 2.0 C-rates). At 0.2 and 0.5 C-rates, Pd3Co/MWCNT-interlayer cell achieves a better performance than MWCNT-interlayer cell during 200 cycles. In addition, there is a definite performance difference for 2.0 C-rate during 300 cycles. The discharge capacities for the first and 300 cycles for the MWCNT-interlayer cell are 869 mAh g(-1) and 525 mAh g(-1), respectively, whereas those for a Pd3Co/MWCNT-interlayer cell are 953 mAh g(-1) and 752 mAh g(-1), respectively. These improvements are resulted from the catalytic role of Pd3Co, which assists the reaction of polysulfide formation/deformation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, a composite is reported, which consists of highly dispersed ultrafine (similar to 5 nm) zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals decorated on conductive three-dimensionally macroporous polypyrrole (3DOMPPy) inverse opal, for polysulfides immobilization in Li/S batteries. Compared with carbon matrixes, 3DOMPPy provides a stronger lithium polysulfides binding site, due to its unique macroporous structure. Through constructing 3D ordered macroporous structure of PPy, a fast electron transfer pathway and an efficient buffer space for sulfur are provided. Furthermore, polar ZnO can confine polysulfides greatly by chemical adsorption, which is verified by density functional theory calculations. Consequently, S-3DOMPPy@ZnO demonstrates durable long-term cyclability (794.5 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.1 C) as well as a remarkable rate capability (515.6 mAh g(-1) at 2 C).

To immobilize sulfur, a nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (PMC) was synthesized with polyaniline (PANi) as the carbon source, which was used for development of Li-S batteries. The nitrogen content and pore system of the PMCs were modulated by varying the pyrolysis temperature to impart good electrochemical properties to the Li-S cells. As a result, the optimal capacity reversibility was obtained with the PMC synthesized at 700 degrees C that consisted of 12.8% nitrogen. The enhanced cycle performance of Li-S cells was also validated at high sulfur contents up to 70% and high C-rates up to 2C. Furthermore, such sulfur/PMC cathodes could alleviate volume expansion during the discharge process. The results suggest that our synthesized nitrogen-doped PMCs prepared by this top-down strategy are promising materials to immobilize active sulfur in Li-S batteries.

The design of active materials with a conductive shell provides an effective solution. Traditional strategies have long been limited for practical applications; however, by low productivity and time/energy consuming template-based methods. Here, a facile template-free self-caging nanotechnology for the scalable fabrication of graphene@sulfur nanocages with atomic-scale shells is reported. To do that, a new sulfur-graphene nanochemistry based on a reductive sulfur solution and oxidative sulfonated-graphene dispersion is developed for the first time. With only the help of mechanical mixing, sulfur particles are successfully synthesized in situ and encapsulated into reaction-induced self-assembled sulfonated-graphene nanocages. These unique nanocages not only provide accommodation of the big volume changes in the active materials, but also exhibit robust polysulfide trapping capability due to the synergistic effects from physical blocking and strong chemical absorption. As a result, the resultant sulfur cathodes deliver superior electrochemical performance and have shown an extremely slow capacity decay of 0.019% per cycle at 0.5 C for over 2000 cycles. This study introduces a new self-caging nanochemistry for scalable synthesis of functional nanocages with significant applications beyond lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, their wide applications have been plagued by low coulombic efficiency, fast capacity fading and poor rate performance. Herein, a facile method for preparation of S@PDA (PDA = polydopamine) composites with core shell structure and good electrochemical performance as well as the First-Principles calculations on the interactions of PDA and polysulfides are reported. Taking the advantages of the core shell structure with porous sulfur core, the high mechanical flexibility of PDA for accommodating the volumetric variation during the discharge/charge processes, the good lithium ion conductivity and the strong chemical interactions between the nitrogen/oxygen atoms with lone electron pair and lithium polysulfides for alleviating their dissolution, the S@PDA composites exhibit high discharge capacities at different current densities (1048 and 869 mAh g(-1), at 0.2 and 0.8 A g(-1), respectively) and excellent capacity retention capability. A capacity decay as low as 0.021% per cycle and an average coulombic efficiency of 98.5% is observed over a longterm cycling of 890 cycles at 0.8 A g(-1). The S@PDA electrode has great potential as a low-cost cathode in high energy Li-S batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the severe polysulfide shuttling and the low electrical conductivity of sulfur cathode limit the practical application of Li-S batteries. Therefore, the designing of sulfur host materials with high electrochemical activity and high sulfur content have great significance for Li-S batteries. Here, we reported a novel hybrid nanostructure (a new sulfide matrix material) through the pyrolytic reduction phosphorization strategy form ZIF-67, in which CoP nanoparticles were embedded into nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes hollow polyhedron (NCNHP). Due to the synergistic effect of highly active Co, CoP and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs), the Co/CoP-NCNHP hybrid improved the adsorption of polysulfides. Micropores in Co/CoPNCNHP effectively impregnate sulfur and inhibit the diffusion of polysulfides through physical constraint. In addition, the Co/CoP-NCNHP conductive network of nitrogen doping carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) interconnection promoted electron transport and electrolyte infiltration. Therefore, the specific capacity, rate capability and cycling stability of Li-S batteries are significantly improved. In particular, we delivered the Co/CoP-NCNHP based cathode (loaded with 74.09 wt% sulfur), which could main the specific capacity of 885 mAh g?1 after 500 cycles of 0.5C current.

Herein, the macroporous multichannel carbon nanofibers (MCFs) embedded with Co/Fe-N active sites (Co/Fe-N/MCFs) were prepared by electrospinning and functionalized as the sulfur host for LSBs. The opening macropores in MCFs facilitate the storage and uniform distribution of sulfur. Meanwhile, the built-in Co/Fe-N sites possess double-end binding sites toward polysulfides (LiPSs), which provides an effective way for immobilization and catalytic conversion of LiPSs. The designed sulfur host with good electrical conductivity and high catalytic activity enables fast kinetics of sulfur redox reaction and reduces cell polarization. As a result, the cell equipped with the Co/Fe-N/MCFs/S cathode shows an initial capacity of 1523 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and an ultrahigh rate performance of 891 mA h g(-1) at 5 C, and a low decay of 0.051 % per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C. This work will enlighten the rational design of advanced sulfur host for practical application of LSBs.

Transmission electron microscope images of DLHC/S single nanoparticle show that the sulfur aggregates predominantly in the interior space between the two carbon shells by using a vacuum infiltration process. The electric conductivity of DLHC/S@PEDOT:PSS increases over 5 times as comparing to DLHC/S without PEDOT:PSS coating. The composite cathode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1089 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and superior rate capacity of 510 mAh g(-1 )even at 4 C, and also remarkable cycling stability with a capacity decay of 0.097% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C. The excellent electrochemical performances for DLHC/S@PEDOT:PSS cathode are primarily attributed to the engineering of the unique multiple core-shell structure of DLHC/S@PEDOT:PSS, which inhibits the sulfur dissolution into the electrolyte and the polysulfide shuttle effect, together with the conductivity enhancement due to PEDOT:PSS coating.

Herein, we report a series of nitrogen and oxygen co-doped and transition metal-decorated large size (200-500 nm in diameter) graphene nanotubes (M-GNTs) (M 1/4 Co, Ni, and/or Fe) as effective carbon hosts for sulfur cathodes (S@ M-GNTs) in Li-S batteries. The exceptionally large diameters of the graphene tubes allow facile diffusion of sulfur inside the tubes with sufficient loadings, yet leaving room for volume expansion during the lithiation process. The GNTs with the largest diameter and abundant N and O doping along with FeCoNi alloy decoration (FeCoNi-GNTs) exhibit the best sulfur cathode performance. In addition to the unique nanocarbon structures, the heteroatom dopants and transition metal nanoparticles likely also play promotional roles in retaining long-chain polysulfide discharge intermediates within the carbon host, therefore improving rate capability and cycle stability. In particular, a S@ FeCoNi-GNT cathode with a high sulfur loading ( 4.5 mgS cm 2) exhibits discharge capacities up to 1234.7 mA h g 1 at C/20 and 909.0 mA h g 1 at C/5. A discharge capacity of 554.4 mA h g 1 at 1C after 500 cycles was retained, further demonstrating its encouraging potential in Li-S batteries.

However, to have any practical viability toward reaching the theoretical value, high-loading cathodes with sufficient sulfur content and specifically the effect of nonconductive binders must be investigated. We consider the limitations of conventional binders for high-loading, high-thickness cathodes by integrating a bifunctional binder with a linear polyethylene chain and maleate-capped ends. The linear polymer allows for flexibility within the high-loading cathode whereas the maleate ends improve the polysulfide trapping ability with carbon-sulfur binding. With the strong polysulfide immobilization ability due to the nucleophilic binding, the binder achieves high sulfur loadings of 12 mg cm(-2) with a high sulfur content of 80 wt %. The work serves as a proof of concept for exploring the incorporation of polymeric materials into sulfur cathodes to realize practical viability.

J	Kim, S; Song, H; Jeong, Y				Kim, Sunwha; Song, Hyeonjun; Jeong, Youngjin			Flexible catholyte@carbon nanotube film electrode for high-performance lithium sulfur battery	CARBON			English	Article							CATHODE; LIGHTWEIGHT; COMPOSITES; REDUCTION	A lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is attracting considerable attention as a next-generation, high-performing battery. In response to the great demand for lightweight, high-capacity batteries, persistent efforts have been made to solve Li-S battery problems such as polysulfide shuttling. In particular, it has become important to develop a flexible battery in portable electronics. In this study, a Li-S battery is made by a catholyte (Li2S6) solution-impregnated carbon nanotube (CNT) film (catholyte@CNT film) with a conductive 3D network structure. The flexibility and electrochemical properties of the prepared Li-S battery are analyzed. The Li-S battery made of the catholyte@CNT film yields an initial discharge capacity of 975 mAh/g and is stable after charge/discharge of 500 cycles. The battery retains more than 95% of its initial capacity even after 1000 cycles of a limited depth of charge/discharge. A pouch cell battery is fabricated to evaluate performance under several bending tests. As a result, it is observed that the battery maintains good open circuit voltage (OCV) despite 1000 repeated deformation tests and exhibits a stable cycling performance both in the folded and unfolded states.

This is particularly true for natural biomolecules with substantial structural and compositional diversities strongly impacting their functions. Here, natural gelatin and zein proteins are first denatured and then adopted for fabrication of nanocomposite interlayers via functionalization of carbon nanofibers. From the results of experiment and molecular dynamic simulations, it is found that the lengths of the sidechains on the two proteins play critical roles. The short-branched gelatin shows significantly stronger adsorption of polysulfides, as compared with zein comprising many long-chain residues. The gelatin-based interlayer, along with its good porous structures/electrical conductivity, greatly suppresses the shuttle effect and yields exceptional electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the implementation of proteins as functional binder additives further supports the finding that gelatin enables stronger polysulfide-trapping. As a result, high-loading sulfur cathodes (9.4 mg cm(-2)) are realized, which deliver a high average areal capacity of 8.2 mAh cm(-2) over 100 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1). This work demonstrates the importance of sidechain length in capturing polysulfides and provides a new insight in selecting and design of desired polysulfide-binding molecules.

All-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries have been proposed to solve the shuttle effect and prevent short circuits. However, solid-solid contacts between the electrodes and the electrolyte increase the interface resistance and stress/strain, which could result in the limited electrochemical performances. In this work, the cathode of all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries is prepared by depositing sulfur on the surface of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs@S) and further mixing with Li10GeP2S12 electrolyte and acetylene black agents. At 60 degrees C, CNTs@S electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performance, delivering the reversible discharge capacities of 1193.3, 959.5, 813.1, 569.6 and 395.5 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 C, respectively. Moreover, the CNTs@S is able to demonstrate superior high-rate capability of 660.3 mAh g(-1) and cycling stability of 400 cycles at a high rate of 1.0 C. Such uniform distribution of the CNTs, S and Li10GeP2S12 electrolyte increase the electronic and ionic conductivity between the cathode and the electrolyte hence improves the rate performance and capacity retention.

Here, we propose a novel three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide@sulfur/nitrogen-doped porous carbon polyhedron/carbon nanotubes (rGO@S/NCP/CNTs) composite with bi-confinement effect of polysulfide as an effective cathode material. In rGO@S/NCP/CNTs, NCP provides physical confinement for sulfur and soluble polysulfide by its abundant micropores and mesopores, while oxygen functional groups of rGO provide strong chemical confinement to soluble polysulfide. Additionally, CNTs with one-dimensional conductivity enable facile transport of electrons. Therefore, the resulting rGO@S/NCP/CNTs composite shows an obvious enhancement in cycling performance for Li-S battery, and reversible capacities up to 738 mAh g(-1) and 660 mAh g(-1) over 100 and 200 cycles are remained at 0.2 C rate.

Cyclic charge-discharge studies at various discharge and charge rates for 100 cycles and at a fixed rate for 500 cycles show superior performance for the gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) compared to the ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) containing batteries. Rapid capacity fading for the first few cycles is observed and its causes are studied using an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) approach. EIS reveals a depth-of-discharge dependent impedance growth during the first discharge cycle, that is followed by an interfacial resistance growth between the electrodes and the electrolytes in subsequent cycles.

In this study, a uniform SnO2/reduced graphene oxide (denoted as SnO2/rGO) composite is successfully designed onto the commercial polypropylene separator for use of interlayer of LSBs to decrease the charge-transfer resistance and trap the soluble lithium polysulfides (LPSs). As a result, the assembled devices using the separator modified with the functional interlayer (SnO2/rGO) exhibit improved cycle performance; for instance, over 200 cycles at 1C, the discharge capacity of the cells reaches 734 mAh g(-1). The cells also display high rate capability, with the average discharge capacity of 541.9 mAh g(-1) at 5C. Additionally, the mechanism of anchoring behavior of the SnO2/rGO interlayer was systematically investigated using density functional theory calculations. The results demonstrate that the improved performance is related to the ability of SnO2/rGO to effectively absorb S-8 cluster and LPS. The strong Li-O/Sn-S/O-S bonds and tight chemical adsorption between LPS and SnO2 mitigate the shuttle effect of LSBs. This study demonstrates that engineering the functional interlayer of metal oxide and carbon materials in LSBs may be an easy way to improve their rate capacity and cycling life.

Tuning electrolyte composition by using additives and most importantly by substantially increasing electrolyte molarity was previously shown to be one of the most effective strategies. Contrarily, little attention has been paid to dilute and super-diluted LiTFSI/DME/DOL/LiNO3 based-electrolytes, which have been thought to aggravate the polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects. Here we challenge this conventional wisdom and demonstrate outstanding capabilities of a dilute (0.1 mol L-1 of LiTFSI in DME/DOL with 1 wt. % LiNO3) electrolyte to enable better electrode wetting, greatly improved high-rate capability, and stable cycle performance for high sulfur loading cathodes and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio in Li-S cells. Overall, the presented study shines light on the extraordinary ability of such electrolyte systems to suppress short-chain polysulfide dissolution and polysulfide shuttle effects.

J	Weinberger, M; Wohlfahrt-Mehrens, M				Weinberger, Manuel; Wohlfahrt-Mehrens, Margret			Novel strategies towards the realization of larger lithium sulfur/silicon pouch cells	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Lithium sulfur battery; prelithiation; SLMP; stabilized lithium metal powder	CATHODE MATERIALS; ION; BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; PRELITHIATION; COMPOSITES; PARTICLES; PROGRESS	We report the fabrication of functional lithium sulfur full cells in button and pouch cell formats with the help of a prelithiation approach utilizing stabilized lithium metal powders (SLMP). A silicon electrode was prepared from silicon nanoparticles, carbon black and aqueous lithiated polyacrylic acid as a binder. The anode capacity was restricted to 900 mAhg(-1) based on the mass of composite. In a half cell configuration it may be cycled reversibly for at least 60 cycles at a specific current of 100 mAg(-1) until the capacity starts to fade significantly. Coulombic efficiencies are well above 99%. However, the system possesses significant irreversible capacity of around 22%. For this reason a spray coating approach was used to coat the surface with SLMP. With this strategy the irreversible capacity could be compensated effectively. On the cathode side carbon/sulfur composites have been prepared by melt impregnation of activated charcoal. The composite was processed into electrodes with a polyethylene oxide/anisol binder solution. The composition ratio in wt% for the cathode was composite/carbon black/binder 80/10/10. At a specific current of 200 mAg(-1), the final electrode showed reversible capacities of 500 mAhg(-1) based on composite for at least 100 cycles with coulombic efficiencies above 90%. To add cycleable lithium into the cell, a slurry processing approach for the cathode was developed. SLMP was simply added to the cathode slurry. Resulting coatings have been stable under glove box conditions and could be further processed to full cells with the prelithiated anode as counter electrode. At first, button cell configurations were investigated. The cells showed higher initial discharge capacities of 400-500 mAhg(-1) based on the amount of cathode composite. Cells are relatively stable for 50 cycles. Larger single layer pouches with effective electrode areas of 24 cm(2) and an initial discharge capacity of 45 mAh at 200 mAg(-1) could successfully be assembled in a next step. The cells show almost the same performance as the smaller button cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, pristine Li2S requires a high activation voltage of 4.0 V, which degrades both the electrolyte and electrode, leading to poor cycling performance. In an effort to reduce the activation overpotential, in this study, we investigate the use of P2S5 in an advanced Li2S-P2S5 catholyte and demonstrate a new synthetic approach that enables facile and low-temperature processing. Our findings show the P2S5 additive generates two thiophosphates with high ionic conductivities in the catholyte, which improve the activation efficiency and the electrochemical utilization. To further improve this advanced catholyte design, we also investigate two modified Li2S-P2S5 catholytes based on carbon black (to strengthen the conductivity) and dilute polysulfide (Li2S6 ; to amplify the reaction activity). Our analysis indicates that the optimal Li2S-P2S5-Li2S6 catholyte attains high ionic conductivity and strong reaction kinetics, achieving a high charge-storage capacity of 700 mA.h(-1) g(-1) with a long-term cyclability of 200 cycles.

It is therefore exigent to rationally design an effective sulfur host. Here a novel sulfur host material alpha molybdenum trioxide (alpha-MoO3) spheres are introduced into Li-S battery cathode acting as lithium polysulfides absorbent and efficient matric of sulfur. The abundant oxygen atoms on the surface of alpha-MoO3, making it form chemical binding interactions with lithium polysulfides, which can effectively alleviate the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. Moreover, alpha-MoO3 as the matric of sulfur alleviates volume expansion of active sulfur and enhanced the utilization of sulfur, which results in improving the battery performances. As a result, S/alpha-MoO3 electrode with the sulfur content of 68 wt.% shows an initial discharge capacity of 1086.2 mAh g(-1) and good capacity retention is obtained with 912.8 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at 0.5 C. After 50 cycles at rates ranging from 0.1 to 2 C, the cell still returns a high specific capacity of 916.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C. The results demonstrate alpha-MoO3 was a promising sulfur host material for promoting the performances of Li-S batteries with high sulfur content cathode.

In this work, we report a novel MoSe2@rGO cathode coating consisting of two-dimensional MoSe2 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a multifunctional barrier to suppress polysulfide shuttling. Few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets are in situ grown on the rGO surface by basal plane contact. Besides, some cotton-like MoSe2 nanospheres assembled from porous nanosheets are decorated on the surface of rGO nanosheets. Benefitted from the strong chemical adsorption of polar MoSe2 and excellent electrical conductivity of rGO, the MoSe2@rGO coatings exhibit highly efficient polysulfide anchoring and significantly enhanced electrocatalytic chemistry. Moreover, the MoSe2@rGO cathode coatings are much superior to its separator coatings in the recycling of the adsorbed active materials because of good interfacial conductivities. The cell with the MoSe2@rGO cathode coating delivers a high reversible capacity up to 1216 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and outstanding cycling stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.03% at 1 C over 1000 cycles.

Nevertheless, the poor conductivity of sulfur and the shuttling phenomenon of polysulfides hinder its application. In this paper, flower-like MoS2/graphene nanocomposite is prepared and deposited on a multi-functional separator to enhance the electrochemical behavior of Li-S batteries. The results demonstrated that the MoS2/graphene-coated separator is contributing to inhibit the shuttling phenomenon of polysulfides and improve the integrity of sulfur electrode. The initial discharge capacity of the battery using MoS2/graphene-coated separator at 0.2 C was up to 1516 mAh g(-1). After 100 cycles, a reversible capacity of 880 mAh g(-1) and a coulombic efficiency of 98.7% were obtained. The improved electrochemical behavior can be due to the nanostructure and Mo-S bond of the MoS2/graphene composite, which can combine physical shielding and chemisorption to prohibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The results prove that the MoS2/graphene-coated separator has the potential for feasible application in Li-S batteries to enhance their electrochemical performance.

Herein, we show that a dual-regulation system of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and octafluoronaphthalene (OFN) decorated on Fe graphene (Gh), denoted as Gh/FePc+OFN, accelerates the interfacial ti reaction kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Multiple in situ spectroscopy techniques and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrate that FePc acts as an efficient anchor and scissor for the LiPSs through Fe...S coordination, mainly facilitating their liquid-liquid transformation, whereas OFN enables Li-bond interaction with the LiPSs, accelerating the kinetics of the liquid-solid nucleation and growth of Li2S. This dual-regulation system promotes the smooth conversion reaction of sulfur, thereby improving the battery performance. A Gh/FePc+OFN-based Li-S cathode delivered an ultrahigh initial capacity of 1604 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.055% per cycle at 1 C over 1000 cycles.

However, there is still a lack of systematical research on the evolution and failure mechanism of the CEI for Li-S batteries. Here, it is found that the integrity of the as-formed CEI is strongly related to the content of sulfur and the amount of electrolyte. When the volume of reduction product (Li2S/Li2S2) exceeds the maximal volume of the carbon host, the as-formed CEI is unable to withstand the volume variation upon repeated lithiation/delithiation. The repeated fracture and repair of CEI unceasingly consumes electrolyte and active materials. Thus, to achieve prolonged cycle stability via solid-phase conversion, the content of sulfur and the interior space of the host should be well matched. Based on the above understanding, the designed sulfur-graphite full cell shows an excellent cyclability over 2000 cycles. This work reveals the failure mechanism of solid-phase conversion reactions in Li-S batteries, and provides some inspiration for designing long-life and high-sulfur-content cathode materials.

To alleviate this problem, we developed multifunctional organic matter, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS), for preparing a uniform hybrid consists of silica 3D network skeleton and copolymerized sulfur nanoparticles (cpS). In this hybrid, abundant amidogen in APS induced polymerization with sulfur, which formed uniform copolymerized sulfur nanoparticles (nano sulfur), restraining the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Meanwhile, polycondensation APS not only acted as an efficiently binder, affording compact cathodes, but also formed a stable 3D silica structure to encapsulate sulfur nanoparticles, relieving the volume change of sulfur. Consequently, this binder-free cpS composite exhibited much enhanced electrochemical performances, including a high capacity of 1187.8 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1 C and a low capacity fading of 0.0654% per cycle for 500 cycles at 1 C.

Catalysis is a promising way to solve this problem, but the rational design of relevant catalysts is still hard to achieve. This paper reports the WS2-WO3 heterostructures prepared by in situ sulfurization of WO3, and by controlling the sulfurization degree, the structure is controlled, which balances the trapping ability (by WO3) and catalytic activity (by WS2) toward LiPSs. As a result, the WS2-WO3 heterostructures effectively accelerate LiPS conversion and improve sulfur utilization. The Li-S battery with 5 wt% WS2-WO3 heterostructures as additives in the cathode shows an excellent rate performance and good cycling stability, revealing a 0.06% capacity decay each cycle over 500 cycles at 0.5 C. By building an interlayer with such heterostructure-added graphenes, the battery with a high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2) still shows a high capacity retention of 86.1% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. This work provides a rational way to prepare the metal oxide-sulfide heterostructures with an optimized structure to enhance the performance of Li-S batteries.

The PI-directing carbon aerogel (PI-CA) presents a cross-linked framework, abundant porosity, and a high specific surface area. PI-CA spheres present effective immobilizing polysulfides and high loading sulfur for a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 2039.4 m(2) g(-1) and N-doping via physical and chemical adsorption. The Li-S batteries with PI-CA as cathode matrix exhibit excellent performance. In particular, the initial specific capacity of 2PI-CA/S with sulfur content of 73.8 wt% delivers 1338 mAh g(-1) and remains at 1102 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. The enhanced electrochemical performance mainly benefits from the mesh structure of the composite and the interaction between nitrogen and lithium polysulfide. The theoretical calculation by density functional theory (DFT) further supports the template effect of PI and the anchoring mechanism of polysulfides.

Hence, this paper reports a hollow MoO2 sphere anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene. The hollow MoO2 sphere controls the polysulfide dissolution, and the nitrogen-doped graphene provides a conductive network and high sulfur loading. Meanwhile, the C-O-Mo bond interlinking MoO2 and N-doped graphene provides a pathway for electron transfer, and the synergistic effect enhances the kinetics of lithium sulfur batteries profitably. Ascribed to the unique structure of MoO2/nitrogen-doped graphene, the obtained electrode exhibits a substantially enhanced electrochemical performance.

Here, the conductive and polar niobium nitride (NbN) is in-situ introduced onto graphene with ultrasmall size and high dispersion, and their composite is used to construct an efficient lithium polysulfide blocking layer. The graphene helps to construct highly conductive pathways, and niobium nitride serves as the sulfiphilic sites to chemically adsorb the migrating lithium polysulfides and catalyze their redox conversion. Hence, the cells with the NbN/G interlayers exhibit a long cycle life with a lower capacity decay of 0.096%/cycle at 1 C for 300 cycles and high rate capability of 937 mAh g(-1) at 2 C. Further coupling with a sulfur/carbon nanofiber electrode, the cell with an ultra-high sulfur loading of 10.8 mg cm(-2) delivers an areal capacity of 12.5 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C.

The performance of the C-S cathode material with carbon particles (CP) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as electrical conductors and CMC + SBR as binder was evaluated in Li/S cells using cyclic voltammetry, constant current cycling, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The C-S material and the electrodes were examined by scanning electron microscopy. It is found that the C-S cathode with CNFs shows improvement of not only discharge capacity but also cycling durability. It exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1200 mAh g(-1), or 72% of theoretical, and retains 668 mAh g(-1), or 40% of the sulfur theoretical capacity after 50 cycles. The C-S electrode with CNFs has a three-dimensional network structure with regular pores, which can suppress the agglomeration of sulfur or lithium sulfide. Thus, the cell performance is improved.

Herein a porous microdisk Ti4O7/TiN/C heterojunction with strong polar N-Ti-O covalent bonds is precisely constructed. Compared with O-Ti-O or N-Ti-N bond in single Ti4O7 or TiN, the N-Ti-O bond with stronger polarity could adsorb and bond with S and Li atoms in LiPSs, which is beneficial for LiPSs adsorption. Beside, the Ti4O7/TiN heterostructure favors the electron transfer, which could promote the conversion of LiPSs. The design strategy is to construct abundant polar N-Ti-O bonds at Ti4O7/TiN heterogeneous interface that would realize the associative process of LiPSs adsorption, trapping, and conversion, thereby restraining the shuttle effect efficiently. In the current study, as the host of the sulfur cathode, the porous microdisk TiN/Ti4O7 /C heterojunc-tion exhibits a high specific capacity of 1204.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, and a high specific capacity of 616.5 mAh g(-1) at an ultrahigh current density of 4 C. In addition, 86.4% and 116.9% capacity are retained over 1000 cycles at 1 C and 2 C, respectively. This strategy provides an insight into developing lithium-sulfur battery with extraordinary performance, and opens promising routes to design the next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices.

Effective Bipyridine and Pyrazine-Based Polysulfide Dissolution Resistant Complex Framework Material Systems for High Capacity Rechargeable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; noncarbonized sulfate CFM; polysulfide encapsulation	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; MESOPOROUS CARBON; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; INFRARED-SPECTRA; POROUS CARBON; LONG-LIFE; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; POLYMER ELECTROLYTE; CYCLING STABILITY; CATHODE MATERIAL	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high theoretical capacity (approximate to 1650 mAh g(-1)) and specific energy density (approximate to 2567 Wh g(-1)) have not achieved commercialization status due to low cycling stability arising from lithium polysulfide dissolution. Herein, sulfur infiltrated noncarbonized noncarbonate containing metal organic complex framework material (CFM) systems; sulfur-copper-bipyridine-CFM (S-Cu-bpy-CFM) and sulfur-copper-pyrazine-CFM (S-Cu-pyz-CFM) are developed as sulfur cathodes for the first time. The S-Cu-bpy-CFM and S-Cu-pyz-CFM show an initial capacity of 1626 and 1565 mAh g(-1) with stable capacities of 1063 and 1025 mAh g(-1), respectively, after 150 cycles. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis after sulfur infiltration reveals the presence of -C-S- bonds arising from the Lewis acid-base interaction of the CFMs with sulfur. The battery separators cycled with the CMF cathodes display complete absence of polysulfides after 150 cycles. These CFM cathodes exhibit an initial fade in capacity during the first approximate to 25 cycles attributed to the irreversible reaction of nitrogen with sulfur (-N-S-) during cycling. A clear understanding of this chemical interaction between sulfur and nitrogen present in the sulfur-infiltrated CFMs is essential for engineering nitrogen containing hosts for trapping polysulfides effectively. Understanding reported here will lead to new materials for achieving the high specific energy densities characteristic to Li-S batteries.

Less attention is given to Li-S batteries with high volume energy density, which is crucial for applications in compact space. Here, a series of elastic sandwich-structured cathode materials consisting of alternating VS2-attached reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets and active sulfur layers are reported. Due to the high polarity and conductivity of VS2, a small amount of VS2 can suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides and improve the redox kinetics of sulfur species in the whole sulfur layer. Sandwich-structured rGO-VS2/S composites exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with high discharge capacities, low polarization, and excellent cycling stability compared with their bare rGO/S counterparts. Impressively, the tap density of rGO-VS2/S with 89 wt% sulfur loading is 1.84 g cm(-3), which is almost three times higher than that of rGO/S with the same sulfur content (0.63 g cm(-3)), and the volumetric specific capacity of the whole cell is as high as 1182.1 mA h cm(-3), comparable with the state-of-the-art reported for energy storage devices, demonstrating the potential for application of these composites in long-life and high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

Sm-MOF doping plays an important role in regulating the structure of the gel and promoting the formation of samarium oxide in an amorphous state that is uniformly dispersed among the carbon spheres. A CA/S/Sm electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1322 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.2 C. Furthermore, it possesses an initial discharge capacity of 1212 mAh g(-1)at 0.5 C and still maintains a value of 866 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles. Both the anchoring of polysulfides to uniformly doped Sm and the influence of the Sm-MOF on the CA structure lead to the excellent performance of the battery, and effectively prevent polysulfides escaping from cathode, while suppressing the shuttle effect and enhancing the utilization of sulfur.

The obtained G-mesosilica nanosheets possess a mesoporous structure with two sizes (2.8 nm and 14 nm) of mesopores, an uniform thickness of similar to 22 nm and a high specific surface area of 966 m(2) g(-1). As the sulfur hosts, the small mesoporous (2.8 nm) in each G-mesosilica nanosheet can effectively prevent the shuttle effect. As a consequence, the sulfur cathodes with unique G-mesosilica nanosheets as the sulfur hosts (G-mesosilica nanosheets/S cathodes) can significantly improve the long-term cycle performance (81% capacity retention after 500 cycles) of Li-S batteries.

J	Choi, C; Kim, DW				Choi, Changhoon; Kim, Dong-Wan			Silica-templated hierarchically porous carbon modified separators for lithium-sulfur batteries with superior cycling stabilities	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Li-S battery; Separator modification; Polysulfide shuttle effect; Porous carbon	LI-S BATTERIES; HYBRID SEPARATOR; FIBER MEMBRANE; PERFORMANCE; INTERLAYER; CATHODE; PROGRESS; POLYSULFIDES; FABRICATION; COMPOSITE	Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have attracted considerable attention for use in next-generation rechargeable storage devices owing to their high theoretical capacities (1675 mA h g(-1)) and natural abundance of sulfur. However, the commercialization of LSBs is hindered by the polysulfide shuttle effect and unstable cycling performances of the conventional cell configurations. As the separator is a crucial component of the cell assembly, separator modification is considered an effective approach to the fabrication of a high-performance LSB without the use of a sophisticated cathode. In this study, hierarchically porous carbons are used for the fabrication of multi-functional glass fiber (GF) separators as upper current collectors and polysulfide trapping materials. An optimized porous carbon (denoted as MC-SM) is fabricated by tuning the porosity properties such as the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and pore distribution. The MC-SM-coated GF separator provides excellent discharge capacity of 1019 mA h g(-1) and Columbic efficiency (similar to 100%) at a current density of 0.2C after 150 cycles. Even at high current rates, the cell with the fabricated porous carbon can deliver considerable reversible capacities of 700 mA h g(-1) at 1C and 591 mA h g(-1) at 2C after 500 cycles.

J	He, C; Liang, Y; Zhang, WX				He, Cheng; Liang, Yu; Zhang, Wenxue			Design of Novel Transition-Metal-Doped C6N2 with High-Efficiency Polysulfide Anchoring and Catalytic Performances toward Application in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article; Early Access						lithium-sulfur batteries; transition-metal-doped C6N2; adsorption; catalytic oxidation; first-principles calculation	POROUS CARBON; MONOLAYER; OXIDATION; GRAPHENE; SURFACE; CHEMISTRY; POLYMERS; C2N; SE	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are highly expected because of their high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, its application still faces challenges, including the shuttle effect affecting the sulfur reduction reaction, the high decomposition energy barrier of Li2S during charging, the volume change of sulfur, and the poor conductivity during charging and discharging. Here, combined with density functional theory and particle swarm optimization algorithm for the nitrogen carbide monolayer structural search (CmN8-m, m = 1-8), the surprising discovery is that a single metal-atom-doped C6N2 monolayer could effectively accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfide and anchor lithium polysulfide during discharging and decrease the decomposition energy barrier of Li2S during charging. This "anchoring and catalyzing" mechanism effectively reduces the shuttle effect and greatly improves the reaction kinetics. Among a series of metal atoms, Cr is the best doping element, and it exhibits suitable adsorption energy for polysulfides and the lowest decomposition energy barrier for Li2S. This work opens up a new way for the development of transition-metal-doped carbon-nitrogen materials with an excellent catalytic activity for lithium polysulfide as cathode materials for Li-S batteries.

On this account, a template-free arc-discharge method for the synthesis of TiSx (1.5 < x < 2)@HCN (hollow carbon nanocage) as an efficient sulfur host is developed for LSBs. TiSx@HCN can accommodate the volume changes of active materials and inhibit the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Theoretical calculation shows that the defective titanium sulfide accelerates the conversion of long-chain LiPSs to intermediate species and promotes the redox reactions. As a consequence, the resulting hybrid cathode composited with sulfur exhibits excellent electrochemical performances. A reversible capacity of 1118.6 mA h g(-1) is obtained under 0.1 C with a slow capacity decay of 0.108% per cycle for 200 cycles. The synthetic strategy provides a facile platform for the synthesis of nanocomposite materials.

The effect of the physical parameters of ACs and the combined effect of electrolyte molarity were investigated. The performance of the cells at two different temperatures of 25 and 70 degrees C were compared. For room temperature operation of the cells, the capacities of S infiltrated into microporous AC having smaller pore size and stronger interactions with sulfur and sulfides were lower than those of the S infiltrated into micro- and mesoporous ACs containing larger pores. In contrast, the microporous AC demonstrated higher capacity at the elevated temperature due to the improved ion transport rate. The effect of electrolyte molarity on the performance of Li/S cells was found to depend on the AC pore size and particle size distributions. Increasing electrolyte molarity from 1 to 3 M demonstrated improved cell performance and reduced polysulfide dissolution in all the studied S-AC samples. However, further increasing electrolyte salt concentration resulted in a high polarization and reduced cell performance in S-ACs having large particle size or smaller pores. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To solve these issues, freestanding titanium carbide-modified carbon nanofibers (TiC/CNFs) electrocatalytic membrane for Li-S batteries is prepared by facile vacuum filtration method with commercial CNFs and TiC nanoparticles. CNFs provide fast pathways for electron transfer and lithium ion diffusion, promote the catalytic conversion, and restrain the shuttle effect. TiC nanoparticles are decorated on the surface of the CNFs, play a role in adsorbing, and catalyze the conversion of lithium polysulfides. Due to advantage structure, TiC/CNFs@Li2S6 electrode (sulfur loading, 4.74 mg) exhibits excelled cycling stability (initial discharge capacity, 879 mAh g(-1); 758 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C over 200 cycles). The above results provide an effective route for high performance of Li-S batteries.

Efforts are made to synthesize N-doped carbon materials by introducing nitrogen-rich sources followed by sintering or hydrothermal processes. In the present work, an in situ hollow cathode discharge plasma treatment method is used to prepare 3D porous frameworks based on N-doped graphene as a potential conductive matrix material. The resulting N-doped graphene is used to prepare a 3D porous framework with a S content of 90 wt% as a cathode in lithium-sulfur cells, which delivers a specific discharge capacity of 1186 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, a coulombic efficiency of 96% after 200 cycles, and a capacity retention of 578 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C after 1000 cycles. The performance is attributed to the flexible 3D structure and clustering of pyridinic N-dopants in graphene. The N-doped graphene shows high electrochemical performance and the flexible 3D porous stable structure accommodates the considerable volume change of the active material during lithium insertion and extraction processes, improving the long-term electrochemical performance.

The results showed that the reaction of polysulfides attacking the ethyl carbon of EC is more favorable than that attacking the carbonyl carbon of EC in terms of the activation energies and Gibbs free energies. Sulfur groups in polysulfides display strong Raman signals, so that simulated Raman spectra of the products of the S-n(2-) + EC reaction significantly change after the reaction. The coordination effect of Li+ cation also influenced the simulated Raman spectra of reaction products. DFT results and Raman spectroscopic analysis provide a new insight on structural stability of polysulfides and EC electrolyte in the lithium sulfur battery.

However, due to large ion-diffusion length, commercial sulfur suffers from low practical capacity. To achieve adequate capacity with long-term cyclability using the commercial sulfur-based cathodes, we introduce ultrathin lithium aluminate (LiAlO2) nanoflakes as polysulfide immobilizers with excellent Li+ ion conductivity. The ultrathin LiAlO2 nanoflake-inlaid sulfur cathode exhibits high areal capacity with extremely stable cycling performance. At a current rate of 0.2C, our cathode delivered a high areal capacity of 4.86 mA h cm(-2) during the first cycle and retains 4.75 mA h cm(-2) after 100 cycles. At a high current rate of 3C, the cathode retains the areal capacity of 2.52 mA h cm(-2) after 500 cycles, with an extremely low capacity decay rate of 0.02% per cycle. In situ Raman spectroscopy studies coupled with the chronoamperometry technique reveal that LiAlO2 nanoflakes catalyze the redox kinetics in the Li-S batteries. This work shows a promising strategy to directly utilize commercial sulfur powder in practical Li-S batteries.

However, it is still limited by the uncontrolled shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode and the promiscuous dendrite growth over the lithium anode. To handle the above issues, the highly conductive CoTe catalyst is precisely loaded onto nitrogen-doped nanotube and graphene-like carbon (CoTe subset of NCGs), which is employed as a bi-functionally integrated host. On the lithium anode, the CoTe subset of NCGs with excellent lithiophilic property effectively regulate the uniform deposition of lithium and achieve the effect of suppressing the disorderly growth of lithium dendrites. On the sulfur cathode, the electrochemical conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is catalyzed to mitigate the notorious shuttle effect. In view of the bifunctionality of CoTe subset of NCGs, the assembled full cell can be steadily stable even for 800 cycles at a high rate of 2 C, and the capacity decay rate is only 0.05% per cycle. The areal capacity of 6.0 mAh.cm(-2) is well retained after 50 cycles under the conditions of high sulfur loading, poor electrolyte (a low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio, E/S = 4.2), and low negative to positive capacity ratio (N/P=1.6:1).

Both problems are caused by the solubility of the active materials of the positive electrode in the electrolyte. Processes at the negative and positive electrodes result in self-discharge and aging of LSB. Sulfur (S) and lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn), dissolved in the electrolyte, interact with the lithium metal electrode, causing the formation of insoluble lithium sulfide (Li2S). The main reasons for irreversible capacity loss are the accumulation of Li2S on the negative electrode and the binding of S and Li2S in the micropores of carbon materials, included in positive electrodes, during prolonged cycling and storage of LSB. Li2S does not accumulate on the lithium electrode during storage of LSB for 120 days. The equilibrium content of Li2S on the lithium electrode is 0.06 mg cm(-2). The main reason for the irreversible capacity loss is the binding of sulfur in the pore spaces of the carbon particles. The interaction of sulfur and Li2Sn (n > 4) with metallic lithium, causing the formation of soluble Li2Sn (n <= 4), is the reason for a reversible capacity loss.

Unfortunately, polysulfide dissolution in ether-based electrolytes is still a major problem of Li-S batteries. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) can be used as electrode material in carbonate-based electrolytes to avoid large-scale dissolution of polysulfides. But SPAN composites usually suffer from low sulfur content (<50wt%) and low capacity, limiting their practical application. Here, we synthesize a novel Se doped SPAN (SeSPAN) composite by one-step thermal treatment. Se atoms are uniformly distributed in the SeSPAN composite and serve as binding sites for S species, increasing the sulfur content up to about 60 wt%, higher than previously reported results. In addition, the Se doping itself is contributing to an increased capacity. The discharge/charge mechanism of the SeSPAN composite is investigate by Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicating the existence of Se-S bonds and good electrochemical reversibility. Thus, the SeSPAN cathode delivers an excellent initial specific capacity of 1044 mAhg(-1) (calculated for the mass of the whole composite) and a high coulombic efficiency of almost 100%. Compared with conventional SPAN composites, our SeSPAN material shows a great improvement on the capacity and cycle life and provides a new way to build high capacity SPAN composites.

To address both of the issues simultaneously, a well-designed hybrid of MgO ultrafine nanocrystals dispersed on graphene-supported carbon nanosheets (MCG) is developed via a facile self-template strategy as dual-functional host for both sulfur and lithium. Relying on the coordination of strong LiPS-capturing capability, the shuttling effect is inhibited. Furthermore, the lithiophilic configuration with high specific surface area induce homogenous Li deposition, thus preventing the formation of disordered lithium dendrite. Integrating all these advantages, a full cell based on S@MCG cathode and Li@MCG@Cu anode exhibits a stable capacity at 0.5 C for 150 cycles with a low capacity fading rate. Furthermore, the full cell achieves a high capacity retention of 85.5% at a high S areal loading of 3.82 mg cm(-2) under the condition of a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S) of 6.5 mu L mg(-1) and negative/positive capacity ratio (N/P) of 3. This strategy satisfying both cathode and anode host provides a viable approach to realize high-energy-density and dendrite-free LSBs.

CMK-8 provides perfect 3D conductive network. Furthermore, PPY is coated onto the surface of CMK-8/sulfur (CMK-8/S) composite to inhibit the migration of lithium polysulfide and offer better lithium ion conductive channels. The microstructure and electrochemical performance of the PPY@CMK-8/sulfur (PPY@CMK-8/S) cathode are investigated systematically. The results show that PPY layer with about 50 nm thickness is coated uniformly on the surface of CMK-8/S. The Li S battery with PPY@CMK-8/S as cathode material presents a discharge capacity of 937.8 mAh g(-1) at 20 cycles and is stabilized at about 860 mAh g(-i) after 100 cycles at 0.2C.

However, due to the shuttling and low reduction kinetics of the lithium polysulfides (LiPS), the advantages of Li-S batteries are hidden by their rapidly decreased cycle capacity, especially for the batteries with high sulfur content. Here, sulfur was sandwiched into two kinds of layered materials, namely the TixOy-Ti(3)C(2)ene heterojunction layer and the C3N4 layer, which can exert polar adsorption and Lewis acid-base interaction to LiPS, respectively. The sandwich structure not only increase the anchoring force to LiPS by the two adsorption layers, also enhance the reduction kinetics of LiPS to Li2S by the synergistic effect of the bidirectional adsorption from the two functional layers. Experimental results consistent with theoretical calculations confirmed the accelerating effect of the sandwich structural material on LiPS reduction. According to this "anchoring and catalyzing" mechanism, the shuttle effect is effectively reduced and the reaction kinetics is greatly increased. High capacity of 749.5 mAh g(-1) after 2000 cycle at 0.5C is achieved. Even when the sulfur load reached 4.2 mg cm(-2), the cathode also remained 70.5% of its initial capacity after 200 cycles. Also, excellent rate capability from 0.5 to 5C was delivered. This work, as a result, demonstrates an efficient design pathway for two-component materials work together to propel the reaction kinetics and improve the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries.

Herein, we report the rational design of cobaltembedded nitrogen-doped hollow carbon microspheres (Co@N-HCMSs) as a multifunctional sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The hollow carbon microspheres exhibit large central cavities wrapped by a hierarchically porous shell, showing a large surface area of 1954 m2 g- 1. Furthermore, the carbon shells display a unique porous architecture, in which small pores are scattered on the outside and large pores are inside, thereby functioning as a selection barrier to confine polysulfides and diffuse Li+ simultaneously. Moreover, the highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles in the porous shell activate the surrounding N-doped carbon layer, which not only promote chemical adsorption of polysulfides but also catalyze polysulfide conversion. This facilitation effect has been confirmed by Bader charge and density function theory (DFT) calculations. When applied in Li-S batteries, the sulfur-impregnated Co@N-HCMSs cathode material exhibits excellent electrochemical performances, especially with a high sulfur content of 90.5 wt% and a high areal sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm-2.

However, the soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates (LPSs) in electrolyte cause undesirable shuttle effect, resulting in the loss of sulfur and poor cycling stability. Herein, a novel tungsten oxide-decorated N, S co-doped carbon nanofibers (WO3@NS-CNFs) functional interlayer is applied to restrain the shuttle effect and enhance the cycling performance of LSBs. On the one hand, the uniformly distributed WO3 can provide strong chemical anchoring sites for binding the LPSs and enhance the redox reaction kinetics. On the other hand, the NS-CNFs can also serve as the polysulfide trappers and enhance the electronic conductivity of sulfur electrodes. Therefore, benefiting from the synergy effect of WO3 and NS-CNFs, the LSBs exhibit excellent cycling performance with a high initial capacity of 1444 mA h g(-1) and reversible capacity of 1080 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 degrees C, and superior rate capability of 946 mA h g(-1) at 2 degrees C.

Herein, cobalt manganate (CoMn2O4) porous nanocubes coated with polypyrrole (PPy) as sulfur carrier are prepared using MnCO3 nanocube template through a precipitation method and a subsequent annealing process. The unique approach can obtain porous CoMn2O4 nanocubes with uniform morphology and abundant exposed active sites. The plentiful mesopores among the porous nanocubes are beneficial to accommodation of sulfur. In addition, the porous CoMn2O4 nanocubes can trap polysulfides in the cycling process owing to the chemical bonds between CoMn2O4 and polysulfides. Moreover, PPy coating severed as conductive layer not only enhances electrical conductivity of the cathode, but also confines polysulfides via the formation of N-Li-S bonds during cycling process. Therefore, the porous CoMn2O4/S@PPy nanocubes with 66.9% sulfur mass content delivered a capacity of 533 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles at 1 A g(-1) with a capacity decay rate of 0.064% each cycle, and a Coulombic efficiency of 98%, suggesting the enhanced cycling performance of cathode. The facile template precipitation method combined with an annealing process contribute a new approach to synthesize unique porous CoMn2O4 structure as sulfur carrier for Li-S batteries (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

It is the key challenge to overcome polysulfide shuttling for achieving long-term cycling stability in Li-S batteries. Here we report a novel strategy for the synthesis of N, S-doped graphene with high nitrogen and sulfur contents via in situ self-assembly of graphene oxide and thiourea-formaldehyde resin and calcination. The N, S-doped graphene serves as a conductive agent and a chemosorbent for suppressing polysulfide shuttling and preventing the Li-metal from corrosion, leading to a high reversible capacity and superior cycling stability. The Li-S batteries with the N, S-doped graphene can achieve an excellent cycling life (622 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C) and a slow capacity decay rate (0.049% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1C). The proposed strategy has the potential to enhance the high electrochemical properties of Li-S batteries.

However, how to prepare high electrochemical performance material is still challenge. Herein, we present a facile way to obtain high crystal quality Li2S nanomaterials with average particle size of about 55 nm and coated with Li3PS4 to form the nanoscaled coreshell Li2S@Li3PS4 composite. Then nano-Li2S@Li3PS4/graphene aerogel is prepared by a simple liquid infiltration-evaporation coating process and used directly as a composite cathode without metal substrate for lithium-sulfur batteries. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the composite delivers a high discharge capacity of 934.4 mAh g(-1) in the initial cycle and retains 485.5 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C rate. In addition, the composite exhibits much lower potential barrier (similar to 2.40 V) and overpotential compared with previous reports, indicating that Li2S needs only a little energy to be activated. The excellent electrochemical performances could be attributed to the tiny particle size of Li2S and the superionic conducting Li3PS4 coating layer, which can shorten Li-ion and electron diffusion paths, improve the ionic conductivity, as well as retarding polysulfides dissolution into the electrolyte to some extent.

Therefore, Li-S batteries are one of the most promising electrochemical energy storage systems. However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is limited by some severe faults, such as the dissolution and migration of polysulfides, the insulation and volume expansion during the cycling of elemental sulfur. Considerable research efforts have been dedicated to solving these difficulties from every parts of Li-S batteries, including separators. By rationally designing and optimizing of separators, the reversible capacity, coulombic efficiency, and cycling stability of the Li-S batteries can be effectively improved. This article mainly reviews the research progress of separator modification materials in Li-S batteries, and summarizes the methods and characteristics of separator modification including carbon materials, polymer materials, inorganic compound materials, metal organic framework, and covalent organic framework materials and other metal compounds. From the anode side, the mechanism through the modification of separators can help to stabilize lithium metal anode is also discussed. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of separator modification in Li-S batteries are pointed out.

However, the production processes of MOFs materials play a pivotal role on the lithium-sulfur batteries performance. Herein, the effect of key process parameters such as heat treatment temperature, heat treatment time, and heat treatment atmosphere on the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries were systematically studied. The results show that at a heating rate of 5 celcius center dot min(-1), heat preservation at 900 celcius for 3 h, and treatment with CO2 airflow for 1 h, the composite material has the best electrochemical performance. The first discharge specific capacity of the lithium-sulfur battery reached 1060.32 mAh center dot g(-1), and after 50 cycles it reached 614.29 mAh center dot g(-1). This heat treatment research method based on MOFs-derived materials can be used as a reference for related research in other energy storage and conversion fields.

Polysulfide dissolution however hinders cycling performance and is the main limitation to the stability of the Li-S system. Here, we tackle this challenge by synthesizing 3D-graphene foam from soybean oil through a thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, which is subsequently loaded with sulfur to form a 3D-graphene-sulfur composite (denoted as S@G composite). The synthesized S@G composite shows high initial discharge capacity (approximate to 1300 mA h g(-1) at 0.8 A g(-1)) and capacity retention (approximate to 80% after 200 cycles). Furthermore, a thin layer (approximate to 100 nm) of tungsten oxide (WO3) on the S@G composite dramatically improves the cycling performance of the Li-S system with an initial capacity of 1425 mA h g(-1) and approximately 95% capacity retention after 500 cycles. The analysis and theoretical calculation results prove that the novel material and approach can enhance the electrochemical performance of rechargeable Li-S batteries and shed light on developing high-performance energy storage devices for a variety of applications.

However, the problem of rapid capacity fading due to the shuttling of soluble polysulfides between electrodes remains the main obstacle for practical applications. Here, a thin and selective interlayer structure has been designed and produced to decrease the charge transfer resistance and mitigate the shuttling problem, simply by coating the surface of cathode with a thin film of functionalized boron nitride nanosheets/graphene. Due to this thin and ultralight interlayer, the specific capacity and cycling stability of the Li-S batteries with a cathode of sulfur-containing porous carbon nanotubes (approximate to 60 wt% sulfur content) have been improved significantly with a life of over 1000 cycles, an initial specific capacity of 1100 mA h g(-1) at 3 C, and a cycle decay as low as 0.0037% per cycle. This new interlayer provides a promising approach to significantly enhance the performance of Li-S batteries.

The obtained Nano-S/FG shows flat morphologies dispersed with numerous nano-sized sulfur particles. Remarkably, nanocrystalline sulfur was anchored on the surfaces of graphene with the help of S-O bonds. The resulted Nano-S/FG with sulfur content as high as 75.4% exhibited excellent lithium storage performance with a high specific reversible capacity of 1268 mA h g(-1) at the current of 200 mA g(-1), and a specific reversible capacity of 536 mA h g(-1) even at the high current of 3200 mA g(-1). Additionally, the reversible capacity can remain as high as 900 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. It can be believed that this work supplied a considerable choice for lithium-sulfur battery.

Especially, these problems are magnified in wide temperatures, which limit the practical application of Li-S batteries. The application of transition metal with chemisorption and catalysis is an effective strategy to capture the polysulfides and accelerate the conversion rate. Herein, a novel separator modified by iron nitride nanoparticles that evenly dispersed on N-doped graphene (Fe2N/N-rGO) is presented. Fe2N as active catalytic sites reduce the decomposition barrier of lithium sulfide and facilitate the conversion kinetics between lithium polysulfide and lithium sulfide, which improves electrochemical performance. Fe2N still plays a role in speeding up the reaction kinetics at low temperatures, and inhibiting the shuttle of polysulfides at high temperatures. Accordingly, the assembled cells containing Fe2N/N-rGO achieve a long cycle life (average fading of 0.05% per cycle at 1C for 700 cycles) and high rate performance (688 mAh g-1 at 5C). More importantly, the cells deliver high capacity with 1043 mA h g-1 and 778 mA h g-1 at 50 degrees C and 0 degrees C, respectively. The work provides a broader idea for the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries in the future.

Herein, the three-dimensional Zn, Co, and N codoped carbon nanoframe (3DZCN-C) was successfully synthesized by calcining precursor which protected by mesoporous SiO2 and was used as cathode host for the first time to improve the performance of Li-S cells. Combining the merits of strong lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) anchoring and accelerating the conversion kinetics of sulfur species, 3DZCN-C effectively inhibit the shuttling of LiPSs and achieves excellent cyclability with capacity fading rate of 0.03% per cycle over 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the Li-S pouch cell has been assembled and has been shown to operate reliably with high energy density (>300 Wh kg(-1)) even under a high sulfur loading of 10 mg cm(-2). This work provides a simple and effective way for the promotion and commercial application of Li-S cells.

However, it has been still challenging to develop a simple and feasible approach to prepare flexible LSB cathodes with both robust mechanical strength. Herein, flexible S@C-CNTs cathodes with controllable thicknesses are successfully fabricated via a facile blade-coating method. Due to the strong cohesion among CNTs bundles and the well-designed structure, the flexible S@C-CNTs cathodes are demonstrated to be with a combination of impressive mechanical strength and enhanced electrochemical performance. For the flexible S@C-CNTs cathodes with the sulfur mass loading of 4 mg cm(-2), the areal capacity is close to 3.0 mA h cm(-2), and the breaking stress is up to 5.59 MPa with 7.77% strain. Meanwhile, the pouch cell exhibits excellent cyclic stability at both flat/bent conditions. All demonstrate that the flexible S@C-CNTs cathodes may satisfy the demands of practical application. Moreover, this methodology is suitable for designing other flexible battery electrodes, such as flexible Si@C-CNTs anodes for lithium ion batteries, flexible P@C-CNTs anodes for sodium/potassium ion batteries, etc. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, the microstructure of carbon aerogel perplexed by many factors, such as solvents, catalysts. In this work, carbon aerogel (CA) is respectively fabricated through phenolformaldehyde reaction under two different catalysts of hexamethylenetetramine and sodium hydroxide, and carbonized under high temperature, and loaded with sulfur via diffusion-melting. The physical properties of resulting CA via hexamethylenetetramine catalyst (CAHE) and the electrochemical performances of the obtaining CAHE/S (sulfur) are more outstanding than that of carbon aerogel via sodium hydroxide catalyst (CASH) by scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller characterization, and galvanostatic discharge/charge test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. With a comparison of common CASH, and sulfur loaded in CASH (CASH/S), CAHE/S electrode exhibits a relatively high initial discharge specific capacity of 1085.6 mAh g(-1), increasing 11% in capacity retention rate at 0.1 C after 100 cycles. After 50 cycles, the capacity attenuation rate is 0.08% per cycle, which displays the excellent performance of the CAHE/S electrode. It is found that the improved performance of CAHE/S is attributed to finer particles and larger specific surface area of CAHE which rapidly improves lithium ion diffusion. This work not only modifies the structure of carbon aerogelbut also provides an important reference value for the potential application of the carbon aerogel in Li-S batteries.

Although 2D metal sulfides have been investigated for applications in Li-S battery, selenides with higher conductivity than sulfides are scarcely studied. Herein, focusing on finding the optimal 2D selenide as sulfur host of Li-S battery, for the first time, a series of 2D selenides were screened in terms of adsorption capacity and catalytic effect on conversion reactions for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) using first-principles approach. Among them, SnSe is the best performer with the LiPSs/S8 adsorption energies of -0.77 to -2.31 eV and lowers the free energy of overall S8 reduction reaction (SRR) by 2.31 eV. For further improving the performance of 2D SnSe, eleven transition-metal doped 2D SnSe (TM-SnSe) were constructed and show enhanced anchoring capability and catalytic effect, among which Ti-SnSe stands out with adsorption energies of -2.09 to -4.01 eV and SRR free energy decrease of 3.27 eV. The electronic and structural analyses unveil that the considerable interaction enhancement between Ti-SnSe and LiPSs/S8 comes from strong Ti-S bond and enhanced Sn-S bond. Combining with the experimentally mature synthesis of 2D SnSe and doping strategy, Ti-SnSe is of great possibility to be obtained and achieve great improvement for Li-S battery.

The separator is coated with carbon black/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (CB/PEDOT:PSS), remarkably improving the utilization of sulfur by serving as the co-current collector. Moreover, the PEDOT:PSS effectively inhibits the diffusion of polysulfides and promotes the migration of lithium ions by providing chemical absorption and cation transport acceleration. When assembling this modified separator into the coin cell, an initial specific capacity of 1315 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C is achieved with a capacity of 956 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, showing a superior performance compared to the cell without an interlayer.

However, the shuttling of soluble polysulfides between cathode and anode as the major technical problem causes rapid capacity fading of lithium-sulfur battery. Here, a multifunctional interlayer between cathode and separator was designed by introducing MnO particles in yeast-derived carbon spheres to effectively mitigate the shuttling problem and improve the utilization of sulfur. In the coated layer, the high level of graphitization of carbon spheres could be beneficial for facilitating ion transfer and expanding the contact area of polysulfide species. In the meantime, the polar MnO material was adopted to block polysulfides via strong chemical adsorption. The resultant lithium-sulfur batteries exhibit a high initial capacity of 800.2 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 1600 mA g(-1). And after 100 cycles the capacity is 642.7 mA h g(-1) with the fading rate of only 0.2% per cycle. Additionally, polysulfide species blocked by physical and chemical effect could be reutilized in the coated layer, which improves the utilization of sulfur active materials. In summary, the combination of metal oxides and biomass-derived carbon in designing the novel coated separator would provide new avenue for preparing carbon-coated material and facilitate the further development of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, their dense 2D nature limits the electrolyte infusion and lithium ion transport, thereby decreasing the rate performance. Herein, we demonstrate that three-dimensional (3D) crumpled carbon nanosheets (CCNSs) decorated with a few nanometers of cobalt heterostructures (CoxSy) that are based on a 2D zeolitic imidazolate framework can improve both the LPS adsorption as well as the ion conduction of LSB interlayer. The method is simple and scalable; the 3D composites are fabricated by post-annealing of 2D metal organic frameworks, which are synthesized by a solution process at room temperature without surfactant. Interestingly, the assembly and polarity of cobalt heterostructures can be further manipulated by the annealing condition; this provides a scientific evidence for the nanostructural and compositional combination of polar compounds. Consequently, CoS/Co9S8@CCNS exhibits the best performance with a discharge capacity of 911 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles (150% more than commercial sulfur cell) and the long-term cyclability of 600 mA h g(-1) at 1C after 500 cycles. This is attributed to efficient charge transfer as well as effective LPS adsorption and effective catalytic conversion; further, this is achieved by the synergetic effects of well-distributed polar compounds comprising few nanometers in size and optimal polarity on a highly conductive N-doped carbon nanosheet.

But enhancing the cycling performance of Li-S batteries is necessary and urgent. Mesoporous MgO particles (MMgO) are prepared by surfactant templating method and used to prepare cathode materials for the first time. The prepared MMgO has a hexagonal flake-like structure with a thickness of 50-80 nm, a transverse length of 150-350 nm, a processing area of 181.56 m(2)/g, an average pore diameter of 3.11 nm and a pore volume of 0.26 cc/g. MMgO shows low intensity and slightly broader diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern, indicating the presence of lattice distortion, defects, dislocations or unsaturated valence bonds. MMgO particles are uniformly distributed on the sulfur surface to provide high surface area, many active sites and interconnected channel structure, which makes more sulfur contact with MMgO to be adsorbed, activated and participated in charge and discharge reaction. The Li-S battery containing sulfur/MMgO composite at weight ratio 90:10 shows the best cyclic stability with capacity retention rate 84.7% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. The initial specific capacity of a Li-S battery with sulfur/MMgO composite at weight ratio 70:30 can reach 1062 mAh/g at 0.2 C, which is much higher than sulfur/commercial MgO at the same weight ratio.

These challenges can be combatted through the application of efficient sulfur hosts that provide ample void structures, maintain electronic and ionic pathways, and confine soluble polysulfides within the cathode. This work uses sustainable glucose and sodium chloride as the precursors in a "sweet and salty" synthesis method to produce hierarchical porous carbon as the sulfur host for LSB cathodes. The as-prepared hierarchical porous carbon host (HPCH) is shown to have an exceptionally large specific surface area of 1540 m(2) g(-1) with a favorable pore size distribution due to the unique solvent/porogen system employed during synthesis. The porous matrix can adsorb the polysulfides at the cathode with the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups distributed on the HPCH surface. Systematic electrochemical investigation reveals that the HPCH also possesses both high ionic and electronic conductivity, which allows a reversible capacity of nearly 500 mA h.g(-1) to be obtained after 500 cycles at 0.5 C and enhanced performance at high C rates. This work suggests that the as-prepared HPCH could be an excellent material to host other soluble electrode materials in electrochemical storage devices.

Here, we design a composite material of porous spherical ketjen black (KB)-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (PSKC) with a three-dimensional structure via a spray-drying method. The PSKC material possesses a large pore volume and high specific surface area and is an excellent carbon skeleton for loading high-content S. The S/PSKC cathode with a high S loading of 80 wt % displays an initial capacity of approximately 1226 mAh g(-1) with a rapidly decreasing Coulombic efficiency. To solve the polysulfide shuttling issue, the S/PSKC material is encapsulated by a polymer protective layer via in situ vapor-phase pyrrole polymerization. The elemental mappings of a S/PSKC@polypyrrole microsphere cross section reveal that S is uniformly distributed in the microsphere and the polypyrrole (PPy) coating layer is simultaneously formed outside and inside the microsphere during the vapor-phase polymerization process. The S/PSKC@PPy cathode with 72.8 wt % S shows a specific capacity of 1109.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.15 C, and the reversible capacity remains 931.6 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. The S/PSKC@PPy cathode exhibits superior cyclic stability and improved Coulombic efficiency, demonstrating the PPy layer effectively suppresses polysulfide shuttling.

However, the progress on flexible Li-S batteries was limited by the poor flexibility and serious performance decay of existing sulfur composite cathodes. Herein, we report a freestanding and highly flexible sulfur host that can simultaneously meet the flexibility, stability, and capacity requirements of flexible Li-S batteries. The host consists of a crisscrossed network of carbon nanotubes reinforced CoS nanostraws (CNTs/CoS-NSs). The CNTs/CoS-NSs with large inner space and high conductivity enable high loading and efficient utilization of sulfur. The strong capillarity effect and chemisorption of CNTs/CoS-NSs to sulfur species were verified, which can efficiently suppress the shuttle effect and promote the redox kinetics of polysulfides. The sulfur-encapsulated CNTs/CoS-NSs (S@CNTs/CoS-NSs) cathode in Li-S batteries exhibits superior performance, including high discharge capacity, rate capability (1045 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and 573 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C), and cycling stability.

We prepared a dual-functional interlayer of a gradationally PC60-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) matrix, where the population of C-60-originating carbon moieties decreased linearly across the CNT@PC60 from the separator to the sulfur electrode in a lithium-sulfur battery (LSB). The three-dimensional CNT@PC60 interlayer acted as both a physical ionic shield, impeding the shuttle effect, and a catalytic immobilizer, enhancing the kinetics of sulfur conversion. The synergistic effectiveness of the dual perm-selective CNT@PC60 interlayers in confining polysulfide species enabled delivery by the LSB with a high specific capacity of 829 mAh g(-1) and an ultra-low decay rate of 0.066% per cycle over 400 cycles at 5C. The role of PC60 in this superior electrochemical performance is the different physical and chemical characteristics of the ends of the interlayer. The PC60-rich side acts as a physical barrier with a mean pore size of 0.7 nm, which enables the penetration of lithium ions only without polysulfide intrusion. Meanwhile, the PC60-poor side formed a catalytic immobilizer because of its higher chemical functionalized degree.

However, the issue of polysulfide shuttling requires an additional component to help restrict and convert sulfur substances. Herein, in this work, hollow and porous carbon nanospheres (HCS) are synthesized by a template method and a high-temperature carbonization treatment. A thin layer of ZnS coating is then deposited on the HCS-based sulfur (ZnS@HCS/S) cathode with controlled thickness, and the overall electrochemical properties are systematically evaluated. Results show that with 30 nm-thick ZnS coating, the cathode reveals an improved capacity of 1411 mA h g(-1), and higher capacities from 0.2 to 3 C rate compared with bare HCS/S cathode. Moreover, the ZnS coating also enhances the cycling stability of ZnS@HCS/S cathode over 280 cycles at 0.5 C, with only 0.2% capacity decay per cycle. This work demonstrates potential applications for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

In terms of the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the low flash point and poor mechanical strength of the conventional polyolefin separator are the potential safety hazards to cause the fire and explosion in extreme environment. Herein, a thermotolerant and nonflammable hierarchical functional separator (Z-PMIA separator) is designed based on the poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) membrane and the in-situ formed Co-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-L(Co) secondary nanostructures. Benefiting from the feature of "Aramid" fibers and the special secondary ZIF-L(Co) nanostructures, the Z-PMIA separator not only guarantees high mechanical strength (suffering from a tensile strength of 15 MPa and a puncture force of 0.95 N) and remarkable thermal stability (no dimensional shrinkage even at 200 degrees C) but also effectively suppresses the polysulfide shuttle and lithium dendrite growth. As a result, the Z-PMIA separator delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1391.2 mAh g(-1) and a discharge capacity of 961.1 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles at 0.2C, with a slow capacity attenuation of 0.033% per cycle. Even under the conditions of high sulfur loading (9.23 mg cm(-2)) and low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (8 mL g(-1)) or when running at a high temperature (80 degrees C), the Z-PMIA separator still enables a high charging/discharging performance, highlighting its promising commercial prospect for future high-safety and high-performance energy storage systems.

This can be accomplished by developing novel methods for the synthesis of nanostructured materials that can act as effective cathode hosts. In this study, monodisperse carbon nanocapsules with a diameter of similar to 20 nm anchored on a graphene nanosheet (MCNC/G) were prepared by a facile strategy, which involved mixing of iron-oleate and graphene, heat treatment, and finally, acid etching of iron oxide nanoparticles. This simple synthesis method could be suitable for mass production. We loaded MCNC/G with sulfur by a melting process, and tested the performance of the resulting MCNC/G-sulfur (MCNC/G-S) composites as the cathode material. As a result, the MCNC/G-S electrode infiltrated with 60 wt% sulfur delivers a high and stable reversible capacity of 525 mA h g (-1) after 100 cycles at a 0.5 C-rate with good capacity retention and excellent rate capability (630.5 mA h g(-1) at a high current density of 1C). The improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the monodisperse carbon nanocapsules in the MCNC/G composite, which lead to small volume expansion and physical confinement of sulfur due to the void spaces inside the carbon nanocapsules during the charge-discharge process. Thus, these uniquely structured monodisperse carbon nanocapsules anchored on graphene nanosheets can be promising candidates for other energy storage applications.

Our study provides mechanistic insight on the synergistic effects of sulfur confinement and Li+ ion solvation properties that culminate in a new mechanism of these sub-nanoscale-enabled reactions (which cannot be solely attributed to the lithiation-delithiation of conventional sulfur). Two types of SWNTs with distinct diameters, produced by electric arc (EA-SWNTs, average diameter 1.55 nm) or high-pressure carbon monoxide (HiPco-SWNTs, average diameter 1.0 nm), are investigated with two comparable electrolyte systems based on tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) and 1,4,7,10,13-pentaoxacyclopentadecane (15-crown-5). Electrochemical analyses indicate that a conventional solution-phase Li-S reaction occurs in EA-SWNTs, which can be attributed to the smaller solvated [Li(TEGDME)](+) and [Li(15-crown-5)](+) ions within the EA-SWNT diameter. In stark contrast, the Li-S confined in narrower diameter HiPco-SWNTs exhibits unusual electrochemical behavior that can be attributed to a solid-state reaction enabled by the smaller HiPco-SWNT diameter compared to the size of solvated Li+ ions. Our results of the electrochemical analyses are corroborated and supported with various spectroscopic analyses including operando Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations from density functional theory. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the controlled solid-state lithiation-delithiation of sulfur and an enhanced electrochemical reactivity can be achieved by sub-nanoscale encapsulation and one-dimensional confinement in narrow-diameter SWNTs.

Five approaches were investigated: optimization of the amount of sulfur that can be contained in the sulfur/carbon electrodes, introduction of different forms of carbon additives into the sulfur electrodes, impregnation of sulfur into the pores of high-surface-area carbon via a melting process, addition of high-surface-area TiO2 as a polysulfide-adsorbing agent in the sulfur electrodes, and use of lithium nitrate as an additive in the electrolyte. Among all these approaches, the most effective way to inhibit the shuttle phenomenon and improve the coulombic efficiency of the Li-S battery was the addition of LiNO3 into the electrolyte.

Herein, we report a polyaniline-encapsulated hollow Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (CFP@PANI) for separator modification. The open frame-like hollow CFP was synthesized via oriented attachment (OA). To improve the catalytic effect and electrical conductivity, PANI was coated on the synthesized CFP. The resulting CFP@PANI was applied on the conventional polypropylene (PP) separator (CFP@PANI-PP) with vacuum filtration. With a ketjen black/sulfur (KB/S) cathode with 66% of the sulfur load, the CFP@PANI-PP exhibited an initial capacity of 723.1 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). Furthermore, the CFP@PANI-PP showed stable cycling performance with 83.5% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 A g(-1). During the 100 cycles, each cycle maintained high coulombic efficiency above 99.5%, which indicates that the CFP@PANI-PP could inhibit LiPS migration to the anode side without a Li+ transport disturbance across the separator. Overall, the CFP@PANI-PP efficiently suppressed LiPSs, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance. The current study provides useful insight into designing a nanostructure for separator modification of Li-S batteries.

Herein, we design CeO2-x/Fe@NC with hexagonal bipyramidal structure which combines the merits of strong adsorptive CeO2-x and highly conductive Fe to realize smooth trapping-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs across the active CeO2-x/Fe interfaces. In addition, the mesoporous architecture facilitates the electrolyte infiltration and physically confine sulfur species. The ultrathin N-doped carbon layer, uniformly distributed Fe nanoparticles and oxygen deficient CeO2 nanoparticles not only establish a highly conductive network to promote the electron/ion transfer, but also offer strong physical and chemical confinement for LiPSs to alleviate "shuttling effect ". Attributed to the unique structure, the CeO2-x/Fe@NC-700-S cathode exhibits excellent rate capacity (637 mAh g(-1) at 5C), superior cycling performance (82.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2C) and high areal capacity (5.1 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C under high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2)). This work could inspire constructing heterostructures with active metal-oxide interfaces for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Cyclic voltammograms indicated that the insertion of Li into the sulfur/carbon composite electrode took place over at least three steps during the reduction process. In contrast, the broad anodic current suggested that the electrode kinetics for the extraction of Li were relatively slow. Stable charge-discharge operation of the Li-S cell consisting of a Li negative electrode with [Li(triglyme)][bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide] as the electrolyte was achieved at 800 cycles. This indicates that dissolution of Li2Sx into the electrolyte was effectively suppressed in this system. (C) The Electrochemical Society of Japan, All rights reserved.

Hence, the large pore volume and regular structure of synthetic V2O3 are harnessed to achieve a uniform encapsulated S-V2O3 composite via molten sulfur infusion approach, which were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method and exhibited large pore volume and regular structure. In the prepared S-V2O3 composites, V2O3 not only inhibits the shuttle effect by trapping polysulfide in cathode, but also promotes the sluggish reaction via accelerating the phase conversion of polysulfide. Through the quantitative analysis of accelerating effect based on the cyclic voltammetry curves, the S-V2O3 cathode exhibited a faster polysulfide redox than that of S-C cathode. As a consequence, the S-V2O3 composites exhibited a reasonable high electrochemical performance with a capacity of 973 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and capacity reservation of 67.8% at 0.2 C after 160 cycles.

However, developing high-energy-density Li-S batteries is seriously hindered by their short cycling life, originating from the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides. Herein we for the first time develop a versatile and facile strategy of assembling thin and lightweight bi-functionalized hybrid interlayer constructed by two-dimensional (2D) electrochemically exfoliated graphene and Co(OH)(2)nanosheets (EG/Co(OH)(2)), positioned between the cathode and commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, for high-performance Li-S batteries with remarkably enhanced capacity, rate capability and long-term cyclability. The resulting 2D EG/Co(OH)(2)hybrid interlayer features layer-stacked structure, thin thickness of 5.5 mu m, high electrical conductivity of 900 S cm(-1), low mass loading of 0.20 mg cm(-2), and exhibits bi-functionalized roles of polysulfide physical barrier from EG nanosheets and high chemical adsorption for polysulfides by Co(OH)(2)nanosheets. As a result, the assembled Li-S batteries based on graphene-S cathode, using EG/Co(OH)(2)interlayer, showed greatly enhanced discharge capacity of 918 mAh g(-1)at 0.5 C, in comparison with the cells (831 mAh g(-1)) free of EG/Co(OH)(2)interlayer. Furthermore, our Li-S batteries with EG/Co(OH)(2)interlayer displayed outstanding rate capacity of 677 mAh g(-1)at 5 C, and exceptional cycling stability with a high capacity of 565 mAh g(-1)after 300 cycles at 0.5 C, corresponding to ultralow capacity fade rate of only 0.130% per cycle. Therefore, our strategy of constructing a hybrid interlayer consisting of 2D different nanosheets will offer numerous opportunities for designing long-life and high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

Four kinds of products: Poly (sulfur-diallyl-o-phthalate) copolymer, poly (sulfur-tung oil) copolymer, poly (sulfur-peanut oil) copolymer, and poly (sulfur-styrene-peanut oil) terpolymer were characterized, and their solubility was studied and compared. Among the four kinds of disulfide polymers, poly (sulfur-styrene-peanut oil) terpolymer had the best solubility in an organic solvent, and it was chosen to be the active cathode material in Li-S battery. Subsequently, two different conductive additives-conductive carbon black and graphene were separately blended with this terpolymer to prepare two battery systems. The electrochemical performances of the two batteries were compared and analyzed. The result showed that the initial specific capacity of poly (sulfur-styrene-peanut oil) terpolymer (blended with conductive carbon black) battery was 935.88 mAh/g, with the capacity retention rate about 43.5%. Comparingly, the initial specific capacity of poly (sulfur-styrene-peanut oil) terpolymer (blended with graphene) battery was 1008.35 mAh/g, with the capacity retention rate around 60.59%. Therefore, the battery system of poly (sulfur-styrene-peanut oil) terpolymer with graphene showed a more stable cycle performance and better rate performance. This optimized system had a simple and environmental-friendly synthesis procedure, which showed a great application value in constructing cathode materials for the Li-S battery.

However, their practical application is largely hindered by the low sulfur utilization and poor cycling stability. Restraining the shuttle effect and enhancing the electrochemical kinetics are important for developing high-performance Li-S batteries. Here we use carbon nanofibers (CNFs) supported manganese dioxide (MnO2) composite as a bifunctional coating on sulfur cathode for anchoring polysulfides and accelerating their redox reactions simultaneously. The CNFs/MnO2 composite supplies fast paths for electron transfer and ion diffusion, and greatly promotes the transformation processes of polysulfides to Li2S/Li2S2, leading to an enhanced electrochemical kinetics. The diffusion coefficient of lithium ion has been increased by 560%. As a result, the CNFs/MnO2 composite covered electrode exhibits an excellent cycling stability, its specific capacity maintains at about 600 mAh g(-1) at 1C after 400 cycles, corresponding to a capacity decay as low as 0.063% per cycle, and the average coulombic efficiency reaches up to 99.66%.

First, the pristine MnO2 nanospheres are synthesized via hydrothermal reaction method. After that, N-doping process is achieved by heating pristine MnO2 nanospheres (PMON) under N-2 atmosphere. Finally, NMON/S composites are prepared as cathode materials. To investigate the electrochemical performance, coin batteries are assembled and tested by using the NMON/S composites as cathode materials. The electrochemical results indicate that the initial specific capacity is as high as 1118 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C for the NMON/S composites. The capacity of NMON/S composites remains at 810 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles.

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfide, the low conductivity of sulfur and the serious volume change during charging and discharging process hinder the commercial application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, the flower-like ball-in-ball NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterojunction composites were fabricated as the effective sulfur host in LSBs, which exhibited high specific capacity and durable cyclic life. The NiCo2S4 made up ball-in-ball structure offering more chemisorption sites to limit lithium polysulfide (LiPS) dissolution, and the MoS2 nanosheets grow in the surface of NiCo2S4 sphere to form three dimensional flower structure for accelerating the kinetics of LSBs redox reaction. Additionally, the specific hollow structure also availably alleviated the volume change during charging and discharging. Based on these merits, the NiCo2S4@MoS2 electrode with a sulfur content of 74% possessed an initial specific capacity of 1118 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, and still had a reversible capacity of 865 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles. Even at a high rate of 5 C, the capacity of 467 mAh g(-1) could still be achieved after 500 cycles. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
