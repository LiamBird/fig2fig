Herein, a hierarchical porous carbon/graphene hybrid is designed to host sulfur for Li-S battery. The batteries exhibit good performances including a specific capacity of 1178 mA h g(-1) after 70 cycles at 0.2C, a stable reversible capacity of 400 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1.0C (80% retention). Extensive characterizations including adsorption-desorption isotherms, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, HAADF-STEM combining with soft XAS study the relationship between the structure and the performance of as-synthesized cathode material. The synergistic effect of graphene and hierarchical porous carbon provides the pathway of the electron and Li+ ingress/egress to react with the confined sulfur clusters, retard the loss of the polysulfide anions from the cathode and suppress the shuttle effect during long-term cycling process.

Transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping analysis confirm that the as-prepared composite material consists of graphene-wrapped carbon nanospheres with sulfur uniformly distributed in between, where the carbon nanospheres act as the sulfur carriers. With this structural design, the graphene contributes to direct coverage of sulfur to inhibit the mobility of polysulfides, whereas the carbon nanospheres undertake the role of carrying the sulfur into the carbon network. This composite achieves a high loading of sulfur (64.2wt%) and gives a stable electrochemical performance with a maximum discharge capacity of 1394mAhg(-1) at a current rate of 0.1C as well as excellent rate capability at 1C and 2C. The improved electrochemical properties of this composite material are attributed to the dual functions of the carbon components, which effectively restrain the sulfur inside the carbon nano-network for use in lithium-sulfur rechargeable batteries.

The Li-S battery based on a novel separator allows sulfur cathode to reach a high initial discharge capacity of 1200 mAh. g(-1) at 0.2 C and a reversible capacity of 815 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, which led to an excellent rate capability (up to 2 C rate) and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99%. In this study, the role of separator modified with G/CNT in the electrochemistry of Li-S batteries was also systematically explored. The electrical conductivity and the special leaf stack structure of G/CNT layer have a synergistic effect in controlling the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Moreover, the G/CNT layer can compensate for the effects of deterioration of the morphology of sulfur cathode.

However, graphene is not an effective substrate material to confine the polysulfides in cathodes and stable the cycling. Here, we designed and synthesized a graphene-based layered porous carbon material for the impregnation of sulfur as cathode for Li-S battery. In this composite, a thin layer of porous carbon uniformly covers both surfaces of the graphene and sulfur is highly dispersed in its pores. The high specific surface area and pore volume of the porous carbon layers not only can achieve a high sulfur loading in highly dispersed amorphous state, but also can act as polysulfide reservoirs to alleviate the shuttle effect. When used as the cathode material in Li-S batteries, with the help of the thin porous carbon layers, the as-prepared materials demonstrate a better electrochemical performance and cycle stability compared with those of graphene/sulfur composites.

Herein, we report a high-performance lithium-sulfur battery based on multidimensional cathode architecture consisting of nanosulfur, graphene nanoplatelets (2D) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (1D). The ultrasonic synthesis method results in the generation of sulfur nanoparticles and their intercalation into the multilayered graphene nanoplatelets. The optimized multidimensional graphene-sulfur-CNT hybrid cathode (GNS58-CNT10) demonstrated a high specific capacity (1067 mAh g(-1) @ 50 mA g(-1)), rate performance (539 @ 1 A g(-1)), coulombic efficiency (similar to 95%) and cycling stability (726 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles @ 200 mA g(-1)) compared to the reference cathode. Superior electrochemical performances are credited to the encapsulation of nanosulfur between the individual layers of graphene nanoplatelets with high electronic conductivity, and effective polysulfide trapping by MWCNT bundles.

However, the Shuttle of pdlysulfide induces rapid capacity degradation.aticl poor cycling stability of lithium sulfur tells. Herein, we proposed a unique lithium sulfur battery configuration with an ultrathin graphene oxide (GO) membrane for high stability. The oxygen electronegative atoms modifieci60 into a polar plane, and the carboxyl groups acted as ion-hopping sites of positively charged species (Lit) and rejected the transportation of negatively charged species (S-n(2-)) due to the electrostatic interactions. Such electrostatic repulsion and physical inhibition largely decreased the transferenceof polysulfides across the GO:membrane in the lithium sulfur system. Consequently, the GO membrane with highly tunable functionalizatidn properties, high mechanical strength, low electric conductivity', and facile fabrication procedure is an effective permselective separator system in lithium sulfur batteries. By the incorporation of a=permselective do membrane, the cyclic capacity decay rate is also reduced from 0.49 to 0.23%/cycle. As the GO membrane blocks the diffusion of polystilfides through the membrane, it is also with advantages of antkelfdischarge properties.

In this study, the novel G@CNT nanotubes coated separator offers not only fast electron pathway for insulating sulfur, but also outstanding restriction of dissolving polysulfides. The heat impregnation of sulfur in carbon black also plays an auxiliary role on the cycling performance of the G@CNT interlayer assisted cathodes. As the dual sulfur locking strategy by heat impregnation and G@CNT interlayer, the prepared Li-S cells exhibited high rate capacity and sustainably enhanced cycling stability. Excellent cycling performance with a high capacity 935.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and 755.6 mAh g(-1) at 1C after 200 cycles is achieved. Moreover, the cell delivers reversible discharge capacities up to 669.7 mAh g(-1) and 555.1 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles even at 2C and 4C. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Owing to the introduction of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with the aim to restrain the polysulfide anions diffusion phenomenon, increase the overall electronic conductivity of the electrode and accommodate volume expansion between the delithiated S and lithiated Li2S phases, the resulted graphene-wrapped carbon nanotube/sulfur (S/CNT@rGO) composite makes the cycling performance of the Li-S batteries better than that without rGO. The S/CNT@rGO composite showed an initial discharge capacity of similar to 1299 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C rate. After 100 cycles of charge/discharge, the S/CNT@rGO composite retained a high specific capacity of similar to 670 mA h g(-1), much higher than that without rGO ( < 150 mA h g(-1)). The results show that the graphene-wrapped carbon nanotube/sulfur composite could be a promising cathode material for high-rate performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the insulation characteristic of sulfur and severe polysulfide dissolution hindered their development. We presented a facile approach to fabricate Li-S batteries by coating commercial carbon nanotube or graphene slurries on normal sulfur cathode electrode to construct a dual-layer cathode electrode. The conductive CNT or graphene layer could not only improve the conductivity of sulfur cathode, but also suppress the polysulfide diffusion. The CNT@S cathode delivered a high reversible capacity of 740 mAh/g over 300 cycles at 1 C and 870 mAh/g over 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Furthermore, this strategy could be realized on the commercial product line of lithium-ion batteries, which made it possible to large-scale produce Li-S batteries.

To understand the effect of micro-/mesoporosity in porous carbon for the effective encapsulation of sulfur and polysulfides towards improved Li-S battery performance, two different GDC samples with controlled porosity characteristics, one with predominantly micropores (GDC-1) and a surface area of 1970 m(2)g(-1) and the other with a surface area of 3239 m(2)g(-1), having more or less equal contribution of micro- and mesopores (GDC-2), are used to synthesize nanocomposite sulfur electrodes following melt diffusion process. Electrochemical studies are carried out by using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). EIS spectra collected at different depth of discharge (DOD) in the first cycle as well as upon cycling give valuable insights into the Li-S redox reactions and capacity fading phenomena in these electrodes. The impedance response of GDC-S electrodes suggests a detrimental effect of the mesopores, where insoluble reaction products can easily accumulate, resulting in the loss of active material leading to capacity fading of Li-S cells.

Considerable researches have been devoted to overcoming these issues by introducing carbon-based materials as the sulfur host or interlayer in the Li-S systems. Herein, we constructed a multifunctional interlayer on a separator by inserting Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) in a porous graphene (PG) film to immobilize polysulfides effectively. The porous structure of graphene was optimized by controlling the oxidation conditions for facilitating ion transfer. The polar Fe3O4 NPs were employed to trap sulfur species via strong chemical interaction. By exploiting the PG-Fe3O4 interlayer with optimal porous structure and component, the Li-S battery delivered a superior cycling performance and rate capability. The reversible discharge capacity could be maintained at 732 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles and 356 mAh g(-1) after total 2000 cycles at 1 C with a final capacity retention of 49%. Moreover, a capacity of 589 mAh g(-1) could also be maintained even at 2 C rate.

The SEM and BET results of the graphene-mesoporous carbon show that the as-prepared sandwich-like G-MPC composites with a unique microporous-mesoporous structure had a high specific surface area of 554.164 m(2) . g(-1) and an average pore size of about 13 nm. The XRD analysis presents the existence of orthorhombic sulfur in the G-MPC/S composite, which indicates the complete infiltration of sulfur into the pores of the G-MPC. When the graphene-mesoporous carbon/surfur composites (G-MPC/S) with 53.9 wt.% sulfur loading were used as the cathode for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, it exhibited an outstanding electrochemical performance including excellent initial discharge specific capacity of 1393 mAh . g(-1) at 0.1 degrees C, high cycle stability (731 mAh . g(-1) at 200 cycles) and good rate performance (1038 mAh . g(-1), 770 mAh . g(-1), 518 mAh . g(-1) and 377 mAh . g(-1) at 0.1 degrees C, 0.2 degrees C, 0.5 degrees C and 1 degrees C, respectively), which suggested the important role of the G-MPC composite in providing more electrons and ions channels, in addition, the shuttle effect caused by the dissolved polysulfide was also suppressed.

In this work, we have developed a double-modification strategy to integrate lithium sulfide (Li2S) into a conductive composite network consisting of vertical graphene (VG) arrays and an amorphous carbon shell, forming an integrated cathode (VG/Li2S-C). Facile liquid-solution/evaporation methods in combination with chemical vapor deposition were successfully adopted for preparation of the above cathode. Due to the enhanced electrical conductivity and noticeable blocking effect for the shuttle of polysulfides, the binder-free flexible VG/Li2S-C cathode exhibits high rate performance and reinforced cycles (656.2mAhg(-1) after 100cycles). The pronounced electrochemical performance is ascribed to the unique architecture with a coherent conductive network of VG and the carbon shell, which not only provides a conductive network for fast reaction kinetics, but also forms a durable protective shield to suppress the shuttle of polysulfides. Our research further demonstrates the synergistic effectiveness by means of inner and outer carbon matrixes for electrochemical enhancement of Li-S batteries.

J	Dong, Y; He, RT; Fan, LZ				Dong, Yuan; He, Run-Tian; Fan, Li-Zhen			Graphene and polydopamine double-wrapped porous carbon-sulfur cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries with high capacity and cycling stability	IONICS			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Cathode; Porous carbon; Graphene; Polydopamine	PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORKS; ANODES; PAPER	Rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries are deemed to be a promising energy supply to next-generation high energy power system, yet dissolution of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte leads to poor cycling performance. Here, we report an approach to assemble graphene and polydopamine double-wrapped porous carbon/sulfur (GN-PD-PC-S) for lithium-sulfur batteries. Remarkably, the double-wrapping graphene and polydopamine further help confine the sulfur and polysulfides inside the mesopores and micropores of porous carbon. Moreover, the hierarchical porous structures provide a conductive network for electron transfer and facilitate the effective accommodation of the volume change of sulfur. The GN-PD-PC-S cathode presents an excellent cycling stability of 821 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, with a favorable high-rate capability of 496 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1). Our results indicate the importance of chemically synergistic effect of polymer and carbon in the electrode system for achieving high-performance electrodes in rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the practical implementation of Li-S batteries has been hindered by fast performance degradation of the sulfur cathode, especially at a high cathode loading. Here, we propose a strategic design of binary graphene foam (BGF) as the cathode scaffold, with the incorporation of nitrogen-doped graphene and highly porous graphene. The nitrogen-doped graphene provides chemical adsorption sites for migrating polysulfides, and the highly porous graphene could increase the cathode conductivity and accelerate lithium ion transport. The freestanding foam-like cathode structure further offers a robust, interconnected, conductive framework to promote the redox reaction even at a high cathode loading. Therefore, the Li-S battery with the S/BGF electrode exhibits a high specific areal capacity over 10 mAh cm(-2) and good cycling stability over 300 cycles. This approach offers insights into multifunctional electrode structure design, with targeted functions for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, a freestanding hollow carbon nanofiber/reduced graphene oxide (HCNF/rGO) interlayer is prepared by simple method via vacuum filtration and heat treatment. The utilization of the HCNF/rGO interlayer enables the inhabitation of the diffusion of polysulfides and offers unobstructed channels for ions and electrons. An initial specific discharge capacity of 1318.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a capacity fade of 0.13% per cycle at 1 C of Li-S cells with the HCNF/rGO interlayer are achieved. Meanwhile, the cells exhibit outstanding rate capability with a discharge capacity of 630 mAh g(-1) at a discharge current density of 10 C.

Herein, a facile assembly of graphene oxide and porous carbon is reported to fabricate the inherent nitrogen-doped porous carbon and graphene composited nanostructures. When used as the sulfur scaffold for lithium sulfur batteries, the materials suggest outstanding electrochemical properties, including a high reversible capacity (1372mAh g(-1) at 0.1C), excellent rate performance (451 mAh g(-1) at 3C) and cycling stability (579 mAh g(-1) at 1C after 500 cycles). The enhancement in electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the 3D hierarchical porous structure of the carbon hybrid, in which, besides, the inherent doping of nitrogen can generate homogeneous active sites and defects that can effectively improve the interfacial adsorption. Thus, the simple strategy of pyrolysis and self assembly of graphene oxide and porous carbon provided in this work opens a new avenue for combining different dimensional nanocarbons to construct nitrogen-doped, multi-dimensional carbon architecture for high performance lithium sulfur batteries.

Here, we propose a strategy to prepare a double-shelled structure S@V2O5 spheres @GO composite.The polar hollow V2O5 sphere can realize the chemical adsorption of polysulfides and graphene oxide facilitates good electronic conductivity, thereby improving rate capability and cycling performance. The cycle capacity of S@V2O5 spheres @GO composite remains 895.7 mAh/ g at 0.1C after 100 cycles and low capacity decay of 0.015% after 200 cycles at 1C rate, attributed to the double-shelled structure of the S@V2O5 spheres @ GO, the resulting electrode exhibits better performance.

In this scenario, lithium-sulfur batteries stand out for their high theoretical energy density. However, several inherent limitations still hinder their commercialization. In this work, we report the synthesis and study of two high-performance activated carbon-based materials that allow to overcome the most challenging limitations of sulfur electrodes, i.e., low electronic conductivity and the polysulfide shuttle effect. The two tailored nanomaterials are based on porous carbon structures mixed with conductive reduced graphene oxide, one derived from an organic waste and the other from an organic synthetic route. These structures not only feature excellent individual properties, but also present excellent performance when implemented in batteries, related to their superior conductivity and polysulfide trapping ability, allowing to obtain improved rate capacity and high sulfur loading cycling. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of the best performing material by the assembly of high-performance pouch cells.

The integration of conductive nanocarbon as flexible scaffolds is an efficient and effective route toward flexible high-energy-density lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a freestanding paper electrode was constructed by rational integration of high conductive super-long carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nano-sized hollow graphene spheres (GSs) through a room-temperature solution-processable method for lithium-sulfur batteries. The hollow GSs afforded close space to accommodate sulfur species, sustain the volume fluctuation during cycling, and retard the dissolution of polysulfides and parasitic shuttle. The graphene walls of GSs and super-long CNTs synergistically constructed hierarchical short-/long-range electron/ion pathways. Consequently, the as-obtained flexible paper electrode was with a high sulfur utilization of 81% (corresponding to 1346 mA h g(-1)) at a current density of 0.17 A g(-1) (0.19 mA cm(-2)), a high-rate capacity retention of 40% when the current density increased to supreme 16.7A g(-1) (18.4 mA cm(-2)), and a superior capacity retention of 89.0% over 500 cycles. This proof-of-concept research indicated the well hybridization of graphene and CNTs holds promise in the efficient use as flexible electrodes for future flexible electronics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur and migration of dissolved polysulfide intermediates lead to low active material utilization and fast capacity decay, which pose a significant challenge to their practical applications. Here, this paper reports a multifunctional carbon hybrid with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon anchored on graphene sheets (NPC/G) serving as a sulfur host. On the one hand, the high surface area and nitrogen-doping of the carbon nanoparticles enable effective polysulfide immobilization through both physical confinement and chemical adsorption; on the other hand, the highly conductive graphene provides an interconnected conductive framework to facilitate fast electron transport, improving the sulfur utilization. As a result, the NPC/G-based sulfur cathode exhibits a high specific capacity of 1372 mAh g(-1) with good cycling stability over 300 cycles. This approach provides a promising approach for the design of MOFs-derived carbon materials for high performance Li-S batteries.

Cassava powder is used as carbon precursor which enables sustainable synthesis. Carbonizing the wet hydrothermal product is found to be a self-activation process, through which abundant pores are generated. The aerogel is used as host to encapsulate sulfur for lithium sulfur battery. Graphene, served as highly conductive scaffold, accelerates the transport of the electrons. The hierarchically porous structure is in favor of improving the electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur battery. Therefore, the cathode with high sulfur loading and high sulfur content can deliver very good performance.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are considered as promising candidates for high energy density energy-storage devices. Therefore, flexible Li-S batteries are desired. In this study, we fabricated composite films of freestanding reduced graphene oxide nanotubes wrapped sulfur nanoparticles (RGONTs@S) by pressing RGONTs@S composite foams, which were synthesized by combining cold quenching with freeze-drying and a subsequent reduction process. These RGONTs@S composite films can serve as self-supporting cathodes for Li-S batteries without additional binders and conductive agents. Their interconnected tubular structure allows easy electron transport throughout the network and helps to confine the polysulfides produced during the charge/discharge process. As a result, the RGONTs@S composite films exhibited a high initial specific capacity, remarkable cycling stability, and excellent rate capability. More importantly, the RGONTs@S composite films can serve as electrodes in flexible Li-S batteries. As a proof of concept, soft-packaged Li-S batteries were assembled using these electrodes and they displayed stable electrochemical performance at different bending states.

However, there are some technical obstacles of lithium-sulfur batteries to be addressed, such as the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Here, we introduced organically modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a coating layer for the separator to optimize structure and enhance the performance of the Li-S battery. The results showed that the cell with a CNTs-coated separator exhibited an excellent cycling performance. Compared to the blank separator, the initial discharge capacity and the capacity after 100 cycles for the CNTs-coated separator was increased by 115% and 161%, respectively. Besides, according to the rate capability test cycling from 0.1C to 2C, the battery with a CNTs-coated separator still released a capacity amounting to 90.2% of the initial capacity, when the current density returned back to 0.1C. It is believed that the organically modified CNTs coating effectively suppresses the shuttle effect during the cycling. The employment of a CNTs-coated separator provides a promising approach for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Here we report a foldable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) rechargeable battery, with the highest areal capacity (similar to 3 mAh cm(-2)) reported to date among all types of foldable energy-storage devices. The key to this result lies in the use of fully foldable and superelastic carbon nanotube current-collector films and impregnation of the active materials (S and Li) into the current-collectors in a checkerboard pattern, enabling the battery to be folded along two mutually orthogonal directions. The carbon nanotube films also serve as the sulfur entrapment layer in the Li-S battery. The foldable battery showed <12% loss in specific capacity over 100 continuous folding and unfolding cycles. Such shape-conformable Li-S batteries with significantly greater energy density than traditional lithium-ion batteries could power the flexible and foldable devices of the future including laptops, cell phones, tablet computers, surgical tools, and implantable biomedical devices.

The UMPC supplies desirable S pregnancy space and the intimate contact between UMPC and S, therefore improving the conductivity of S@UMPC composite and dynamic performance. Smaller sulfur molecules limited in UMPC thoroughly prevent the formation of electrolyte-soluble polysulfides, hence excellent cycling performance with 900 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles is kept. Ultrathin three-dimensional carbon nanosheets are significant to fast electron transfer and Li+ diffusion contributing to excellent dynamic performance (710 mAh g(-1) at 3 C). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When used as cathode materials for lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the sulfur/graphene composite (S@3D-graphene) with 73 wt % sulfur shows a significantly enhanced cycling performance (>700 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C rate with a Coulombic efficiency > 96%) as well as high rate capability with a capacity up to 500 mAh g(-1) at 2C rate (335 A g(-1)). The superior electrochemical performance could be attributed to the highly porous structure of three-dimensional graphene that not only enables stable and continue pathway for rapid electron and ion transportation, but also restrain soluble polysulfides and suppress the "shuttle effect". Moreover, the robust structure of 3D graphene can keep cathode integrity and accommodate the volume change during high-rate charge/discharge processes, making it a promising candidate as cathode for high performance Li-S batteries.

Here, a novel additive, carbon disulfide (CS2), to the organic electrolyte is reported to improve the cycling performance of Li-S batteries. The cells with the CS2-additive electrolyte exhibit high Coulombic efficiency and long cycle stability, showing average Coulombic efficiency >99% and a capacity retention of 88% over the entire 300 cycles. The function of the CS2 additive is 2-fold: (1) it inhibits the migration of long-chain polysulfides to the anode by forming complexes with polysulfides and (2) it passivates electrode surfaces by inducing the protective coatings on both the anode and the cathode.

The composite cathodes are obtained through a facile and effective two-step liquid-phase impregnation method. Owing to the unique 3D layer structure and functional 2D surfaces of MXene and reduced graphene oxide nanosheets for effective trapping of sulfur and lithium polysulfides, the MXene/reduced graphene oxide/sulfur composite cathodes deliver a high initial capacity of 1144.2mAhg(-1) at 0.5C and a high level of capacity retention of 878.4mAhg(-1) after 300cycles.

Thus, a systematic investigation including perfect graphene, nitrogen doped graphene, iron and nitrogen co-doped graphene as anchor materials for sulfur cathodes in lithium sulfur battery are performed, in order to search new chemical functional graphene with good electrocatalysis and shuttling suppression abilities. Our results reveal that iron and nitrogen co-doped graphene monolayer is a good anchoring material, in which the Li-S-Fe-N four-membered ring structure ensures the stability of adsorption structure and allows adsorption energy of the adsorption structure to be in the suitable range. The effect of the four-membered ring mainly contributes by the strong binding between Fe and S coming from magnetic catalytic absorption. Moreover, the Fe-N-4@graphene can promote the fully discharge of lithium polysulfides benefiting from the low decomposition energies of Li2S and Li2S2 on its surface and the catalytic effect of 3d electrons of doped iron. PDOS demonstrates essential role of iron in rending Fe-S bond with strong anchoring. Our research unravels anchor effect of FeN4@graphene in lithium sulfur batteries and provides invaluable theoretical guidance for high-performance lithium sulfur batteries.

Many efforts have been made to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. However, the complex and time-consuming preparation process hinders their practical application. In this work, an ultra-fast and facile method has been proposed to prepare the sulfur/graphene composites in a simplified and time-saving preparation process with the assistance of microwave. Microwave is introduced to help sulfur fleetly deposit uniformly on the surface of graphene within just 30 s. Nano-sized sulfur within 30 nm is generated in this ultra-fast process. Lithium-sulfur batteries with as-prepared sulfur/graphene composites exhibit good cycling life with a capacity of 503.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. This method makes it possible for lithium-sulfur batteries to be practical.

Sulfur was then homogeneously dispersed onto the surface of Mo4O11/HRG by self-assembly from a sulfur/carbon disulfide solution to obtain a Mo4O11-HRG/S composite, which was used as the cathode material for a lithium sulfur battery. The morphologies and microstructures of the as synthesized composites were characterized by electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy. Mo4O11 nanoparticles not only have a strong ability to adsorb to lithium polysulfides but also lead to a high Coulombic efficiency (96%). Furthermore, the incorporation of Mo4O11 on graphene improves the utilization of sulfur and enhances the cycling stability and rate capability of a Li-S battery.

Owing to the strong adsorption capability and sulfur/lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn) confinement of the natural ATTP nanofibers and partially reduced GNs, ATTP/S and ATTP@GNs/S exhibit improved electrochemical performance compared to elemental sulfur. The ATTP@GNs/S composite shows an initial discharge capacity of 1143.9 mAh g(-1), and a reversible capacity of ca. 512.0 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, giving a capacity decay rate of as low as 0.5% per cycle.

The PCNS are used as the conducting matrix for sulfur to form sulfur/porous carbon nanosheets (S/PCNS) composites, which are applied as cathodes for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The S/PCNS composites exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of about 1600 mAh g(-1) and maintain a reversible capacity of 554 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. The superior performance is attributed to the highly porous structure of two-dimensional carbon nanosheets that not only enables stable and continue pathway for rapid electron and ion transportation, but also restrain soluble polysulfides and suppress the "shuttle effect". The large surface area and unique sheet-like two-dimensional structure of PCNS also leads to a high utilization of sulfur, indicating a promising cathode material for Li-S batteries.

However, practical applications of Li-S batteries are limited by cycling instability and low rate performance, which mainly originate from the intrinsic poor conductivity of sulfur and the dissolution of polysulfides generated during discharge charge cycles. In this work, we demonstrate a low-cost, facile and effective strategy to modify separators with an active carbon layer. The carbon-coated separator can significantly increase the specific discharge capacity and improve cycling stability of the cathode prepared by the S powder and the active carbon. For example, the initial discharge capacity of the S cathode reaches up to 1452 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with a low fading rate of 0.15% per cycle within 400 cycles. Moreover, when the rate is increased to 1 C, the S cathode can still deliver a discharge capacity of 1009 mAh g(-1). The enhanced electrochemical performance can be attributed to the excellent conductivity and strong adsorption capability of the active carbon coating, which effectively suppresses the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The electrochemical analysis confirmed the long cycle life, excellent rate performance, and high discharge capacity of the Li-S cells.

To address this issue, here a thin and lightweight (8 mu m and 0.24 mg cm(-2)) reduced graphene oxide@MoS2 (rGO@MoS2) interlayer between the cathode and the commercial separator is developed as a polysulfide barrier. The rGO plays the roles of both a polysulfide physical barrier and an additional current collector, while MoS2 has a high chemical adsorption for polysulfides. The experiments demonstrate that the Li-S cell constructed with an rGO@MoS2-coated separator shows a high reversible capacity of 1122 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, a low capacity fading rate of 0.116% for 500 cycles at 1 C, and an outstanding rate performance (615 mAh g(-1) at 2 C). Such an interlayer is expected to be ideal for lithium-sulfur battery applications because of its excellent electrochemical performance and simple synthesis process.

However, there are still many problems impeding the practical use of lithium-sulfur batteries, including the 'shuttle effect' and irreversible loss of active materials. Enhancing the interfacial interaction between the carbon hosts and the sulfur-containing guests by rational nitrogen doping is an effective route. First principle calculations were performed to illustrate the adsorption behavior between sulfur/lithium (poly) sulfides and pristine/nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbons with different edge structures. N-dopants on doped graphene nanoribbon in pyrrolic and pyridinic forms donated extra binding energies of 1.12 similar to 1.41 eV and 0.55 similar to 1.07 eV, respectively. Quaternary nitrogen enriched on the edge can benefit from the adsorption of active materials. Compared with pristine graphene nanoribbon, nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbons exhibited strong-couple interactions for anchoring sulfur-containing species, achieving high stability and reversibility, which was consistent with experimental findings. These results shed light on the cathode design of lithium-sulfur batteries and on the potential to understand host-guest interactions in other energy storage systems.

The morphology, porosity parameters, and chemical properties of the as-prepared NPC have been revealed by using various characterization methods, including scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen sorption analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The NPC with a moderate nitrogen content (5.1 atom % on the basis of XPS analysis) retains the sponge-like morphology of nitrogen-doped graphene nanoribbon aerogel, shows a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (1380 m(2) g(-1)), and possesses hierarchically porous structures. Based on its excellent properties such as high porosity, conductive network, and nitrogen-doping, NPC as a superior host is used to fabricate a sulfur-based cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. The high specific surface area and the pore volume of NPC not only allow uniform distribution of sulfur in an amorphous form, but also help to alleviate the shuttle effect of polysulfides. As a result, the as-obtained cathode exhibits a good rate capability and cycling stability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, its cycling stability and rate performance urgently need to improve because of its shuttle effect. Herein, oxygen doped carbon on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (labeled as ODC/rGO) was fabricated to modify the separators of Li S batteries to limit the dissolution of the lithium polysulfides. The mesoporous structure in ODC/rGO can not only serve as the physical trapper, but also provide abundant channels for fast ion transfer, which is beneficial for effective confinement of the dissoluble intermediates and superior rate performance. Moreover, the oxygen-containing groups in ODC/rGO are able to act as chemical adsorption sites to immobilize the lithium polysulfides, suppressing their dissolution in electrolyte to enhance the utilization of sulfur cathode in Li S batteries. As a result, because of the synergetic effects of physical adsorption and chemical interaction to immobilize the soluble polysulfides, the Li S batteries with the ODC/rGO-coated separator exhibit excellent rate performance and good long-term cycling stability with 0.057% capacity decay per cycle at 1.0 C after 600 cycles.

Carbon materials, such as graphene, are considered as promising cathode hosts to alleviate those critical defects and be possibly coupled with other reinforcement methods to further improve the battery performance. However, the open structure of graphene and the weak interaction with sulfur species restrict its further development for hosting sulfur. Herein, a rational geometrical design of hierarchical porous graphene-like bubbles (PGBs) as a cathode host of the Li-S system was prepared by employing magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles as templates for carbonization, potassium hydroxide (KOH) as activation agent, and car tal pitch as a carbon source. The synthesized PGBs owns a very thin carbon layer around 5 nm that can be comparable to graphite nanosheets. Its high content of mesoporous and interconnected curved structure can effectively entrap sulfur species and impose restrictions on their diffusion and shuttle effect, leading to a much stable electrochemical performance. The reversible capacity of PGBs@S 0.3 C still can be maintained at 831 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles and 512 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles.

To promote existing lithium-sulfur battery technologies in the current energy storage market, it is critical to increase the electrochemical stability of the conversion-type sulfur cathode. Here, we present the adoption of a carbon nanofoam as an advanced current collector for the lithium-sulfur battery cathode. The carbon nanofoam has a conductive and tortuous network, which improves the conductivity of the sulfur cathode and reduces the loss of active material. The carbon nanofoam cathode thus enables the development of a high-loading sulfur cathode (4.8 mg cm(-2)) with a high discharge capacity that approaches 500 mA center dot h g(-1) at the C/10 rate and an excellent cycle stability that achieves 90% capacity retention over 100 cycles. After adopting such an optimal cathode configuration, we superficially coat the carbon nanofoam with graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) to amplify the fast charge transfer and strong polysulfide-trapping capabilities, respectively.

To solve the above problems, we fabricated a composite interlayer for Li/S batteries using ZnO nanocrystals anchored on connected carbon nanotube and graphene. The preparation of ZnO/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide (ZnO/CNT/RGO) composite film was inspired from the combination of a one-step sol-gel synthetic technique and vacuum-assisted filtration. The ZnO/CNT/RGO interlayer showed effective adsorption of polysulfides during diffusion experiments. This ZnO/CNT/RGO interlayer can efficiently increase sulfur utilization by immobilizing soluble intermediate polysulfides. When used as a composite interlayer in Li/S batteries, an impressive high capacity of 768 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C was achieved after 150 cycles and improved rate performance of 597 mAh g(-1) at 2C was obtained. This study offers a facile method to improve the electrochemical performance of the Li/S batteries.

However, some technical obstacles of lithium sulfur batteries are still addressed, such as the volume expansion, non conductivity and shuttle effect of polysulfides. Herein, we have described a simple method for preparing carbon nanofiber aerogel (CNFA) via carbonization of the 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibril (TOCN) aerogel. Special three-dimensional (3D) net-like carbon@sulfur (C@S) composite was then successfully fabricated based on CNFA with high porosity, which dramatically alleviates the volume expansion during charging and discharging process of lithium-sulfur battery, improves the conductivity of polysulfide and suppresses the diffusion and dissolution of polysulfide generated during the charge and discharge process. The results showed that the composite material exhibited an extremely high reversible capacity of 590 mA h g(-1) and had a great loaded performance of 390 mA h g(-1) with high load 2.9 mg/cm(2) over 200 cycles at 0.5 C. Compared with other biomass carbon materials, we have omitted the complicated high-temperature activation pore-forming process. In addition, the high sulfur loading carbon nanofibril composite aerogel also provides a way for the high-quality needs of electronic products.

Additionally, sulfur is used as a cathode material because of its characteristics of a low cost, environmental friendliness, and abundant nature. However, the polysulfide shuttle effect decreases the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Here, a rational membrane/electrode design has been applied to lithium-sulfur batteries. A three-dimensional hierarchical nanoporous carbon material derived from cationic resins in a cost-effective process was synthesized at a high temperature and utilized as an intermediate layer to improve the rate capability and cycle stability of lithium-sulfur batteries. Furthermore, stereotaxically-constructed multiporous graphene with a high conductivity (1.6 x 10(3) S m(-1)), porosity and large specific surface area (824 m(2) g(-1)) has been applied in the cathode to increase the conductivity of sulfur, improve the transport of lithium-ions and increase the contact with the electrolyte. In particular, stereotaxically-constructed multiporous graphene was used as the sulfur carrier (sulfur loading 70 wt %). The electrochemical results revealed an initial discharge capacity of the hierarchical nanoporous carbon material intermediate layer-coated membrane of 1008 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C, and the reversible capacity was 532 mAh g(-1) at 1C after 300 cycles. Based on the experimental evidence and analyses, we concluded that the enhanced performance is due to the confinement of lithium polysulfides by the micropores and mesoporous structure of the hierarchical porous carbon material and the increased transportation of lithium ions and the improved wettability of membrane by electrolyte.

Despite the outstanding effects observed by nanoconfinement of sulfur within conductive porous media, few studies have elucidated the ideal nanospace for the Li-S reaction because nanoscale characterization of lithiated sulfur molecules is difficult. We present direct evidence of electrochemically lithiated sulfur molecules confined inside carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using Cs-corrected high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy with electron energy loss spectroscopy. For a certain diameter of CNTs, short sulfur chains were stabilized inside CNTs via the charge transfer interaction, exhibiting a unique electrochemical activity and stable cycle performance compared to those of long sulfur chains. Our findings reveal that optimal CNTs have the one-dimensional channels for smooth progress of the lithiation reaction.

The PONHC/G made from LFP nanoparticles as hard materials provides sufficient voids with various pore sizes for sulfur storage, and doping of the carbon structures with various heteroatoms minimized dissolution/diffusion of the polysulfides. The obtained PONHC/G can store sulfur and mitigate diffusion of the dissolved polysulfide owing to the well-organized host structure and the strong chemical affinity for polysulfides because of the polarization effect of the heteroatom dopants. As a cathode, S@PONHC/G shows excellent cycle stability and rate capability, as confirmed by polysulfide adsorption analysis. Therefore, PONHC/G may show high potential as a sulfur scaffold in the commercialization of Li-S batteries through additional modification and optimization of these host materials.

However, the dissolution and diffusion of intermediate polysulfides in electrolytes still result in rapid capacity loss and poor rate performances, due to the weak interaction between polarized lithium polysulfides and non-polarized carbon host. To address this challenge, a bipolar material, zinc oxide embedded tetrapod-shaped carbon shell (TCS/ZnO) is designed for polysulfides immobilization in Li-S battery. The TCS/ZnO composites are synthesized through a CVD process using tetrapod shaped ZnO nanowhiskers as template, following by a partially hydrogen etching treatment.

The CMK-3/S composite is synthesized via a simple melt-diffusion strategy, and then a thin RGO skin is absorbed on the CMK-3/S composite surface in aqueous solution. When evaluating the electrochemical properties of as-prepared RGO wrapped nanostructures as cathode materials in lithium sulfur batteries, it exhibits much improved cyclical stability and high rate performance. The RGO@CMK-3/S composite with 53.14 wt.% sulfur presents a reversible discharge capacity of about 734 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. The improved performance is attributed to the unique structure of RGO@CMK-3/S composite. CMK-3 with extensively mesopores can offer buffering space for the volume change of sulfur and efficient diffusion channel for lithium ions during the charge/discharge process. Meanwhile, the conductive RGO coating skin physically and chemically prevents the dissolution of polysulfides from the cathode, both of which contribute to the reduced capacity fade and improved electrochemical properties.

In this study, the authors find Prussian blue (dehydrated sodium ferrocyanide) can be converted to N-doped graphene-carbon nanotube hybrid materials through a simple one-step pyrolysis process. Through field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, atomic force microscopy, and isothermal analyses, the authors identify that 2D graphene and 1D carbon nanotubes are bonded seamlessly during the growth stage. When used as the sulfur scaffold for lithium-sulfur batteries, it demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity (1221 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C rate), excellent rate capability (458 and 220 mA h g(-1) at 5 and 10 C rates, respectively), and excellent cycling stability (321 and 164 mA h g(-1) at 5 and 10 C (1 C = 1673 mA g(-1)) after 1000 cycles). The enhancement of electrochemical performance can be attributed to the 3D architecture of the hybrid material, in which, additionally, the nitrogen doping generates defects and active sites for improved interfacial adsorption. Furthermore, the nitrogen doping enables the effective trapping of lithium polysulfides on electroactive sites within the cathode, leading to a much-improved cycling performance. Therefore, the hybrid material functions as a redox shuttle to catenate and bind polysulfides, and convert them to insoluble lithium sulfide during reduction. The strategy reported in this paper could open a new avenue for low cost synthesis of N-doped graphene-carbon nanotube hybrid materials for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Here, we have fabricated a three-dimensional graphitic carbon nitride/reduced graphene oxide (GCN@rGO) network as the sulfur host in Li-S batteries, where the bifunctional GCN strongly binds polysulfides through a chemical interaction and catalyzes the redox reactions of polysulfides. Additionally, GCN coating is also applied to different membranes and when these GCN-coated-membranes (GCMs) are used as separators, they are found to effectively act as the polysulfide barrier to suppress the diffusion of polysulfide intermediates to the Li anode and thus ameliorate the shuttle effect. As a result, the Li-S battery assembled from the GCN@rGO/S cathode and GCM separator exhibited a high initial specific capacity of 1000.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 87% capacity retention with 0.066% decay per cycle over 200 charge-discharge cycles at 0.5 C.

In this paper, the recent progress of the lithium-sulfur battery is reviewed from four aspects: modification of sulfur-based composite cathode material, electrolytes, protection of lithium anode and design of lithium-sulfur cell configurations. The main factors on the specific capacity and cycle stability of the lithium-sulfur battery are analyzed. The prospects and development trends on lithium-sulfur battery are also discussed.

However, the poor conductivity and serious shuttle effects of polysulfides block their application. Herein, g-C3N4/carbon heterostructure on graphene nanosheet (PCNG) is constructed via phenyl-modified strategy and in-situ thermal polycondensation, which has a unique electron cloud distribution with excellent sulfur immobilization ability as well as good electroconductivity. As a result, Li-S cells with simple S/C cathodes and PCNG interlayers show a high initial capacity of 1192 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, and an ultra-long lifespan with a slow capacity attenuation of 0.050% per cycle after 800 cycles. The cell with PCNG/PP separator also has a stable cycle performance at high area sulfur loading of 7 mg cm-2. These findings provide a new sight on functionalizing g-C3N4 for application in Li-S electrochemistry.

The spray-coating of a mixture of graphene oxides (GO) and oxidized carbon nanotubes (o-CNT) can achieve a barrier coating of only 0.3 mg cm(-2), which is much less than conventional interlayers and has no negative impact on the energy density but significantly enhances the electrochemical performances of the whole battery device. Due to the binding forces induced by functional groups on GO and the interconnected nanoscale channels provided by o-CNT, the thus fabricated Li-S batteries show dramatically improved specific discharge capacities of up to 750 mAh g(-1) at 1 Ceven after 100 cycles, more than twice those of batteries without barrier coatings.

However, drawbacks such as poor conductivity of element sulfur, shuttle effect, and serious volume expansion hinder the application of Li-S batteries. Herein, this paper reports a functionalized holey graphene/sulfur composite fabricated by a facile one-pot synthesis method as the cathode for Li-S batteries. The uniformly and densely distributed microholes are etched out on graphene sheets by H2O2 oxidation, with the tunable hole- size and the oxygen-functional group doping along the hole-edge. The numerous microholes serve as the fast pathways for ions through the graphene sheets, while the polar oxygen-functional groups inhibit the movement of lithium polysulfides. Such a functionalized holey graphene/sulfur composite with the optimal hole-size of 0.6 nm shows a significantly enhanced electrochemical performance compared with the control sample without the microholes or functional groups.

The nitrogen-rich porous carbon microspheres were prepared by using yeast as natural precursor and high content of nitrogen (up to 8.52%) doped carbon microspheres was confirmed by the elemental analysis. As cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries, the rGO@HYC/S composite exhibits a high retention capacity of 921 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and 675 mA h g(-1) at 1 C over 200 cycles. The battery delivers low capacity decay rate of 0.09% and stable coulombic efficiency about 98% at 1 C during the 200 cycles. Further, we reveal that the enhanced electrochemical performance is ascribed to a hollow porous structure of carbon framework for sulfur storage, carbon matrix exerted by nitrogen-doping for polysulfide adsorption, rGO wrapper for polysulfide interception and conductivity improvement.

The AC/GA composite with a well-defined interconnected conductive network was prepared by a reduction-induced self-assembly process, which allows for obtaining compact and porous structures. During this process, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was formed, and due to the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface, it not only improves the electronic conductivity of the cathode but also effectively inhibits the polysulfides dissolution and shuttle. The introduced activated carbon allowed for lateral and vertical connection between individual graphene sheets, completing the formation of a stable three-dimensionally (3D) interconnected graphene framework. Moreover, a high specific surface area and 3D interconnected porous structure efficiently hosts a higher amount of active sulfur material, about 65 wt %. The designed S/AC/GA composite electrodes deliver an initial capacity of 1159 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and can retain a capacity of 765 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles in potential range from 1 V to 3 V.

Here, we demonstrate a simply electrochemical assembly strategy to achieve vertically aligned sulfur-graphene (S-G) nanowall onto electrically conductive substrates. Remarkably, in each individual S-G nanowalls, sulfur nanoparticles are homogeneously anchored in between of graphene layers and ordered graphene arrays arrange perpendicularly to the substrates, which are favorable for the fast diffusions of both lithium and electron. Moreover, the hierarchical and porous structures facilate the effective accommodation of the volume change of sulfur. As a consequence, 4 high,reversible capacity of 1261 mAh g(-1) in the first cycle and over 1210 mAh g(-1) after 120 cycles with excellent cyclabllity and high-rate performance (over 400 mAh g(-1) at 8C, 13.36 A g(-1)) are achieved with these S-G nanowalls as cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries, providing the best reported rate performance for sulfur-graphene cathodes to date.

However, practical application of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries can be achieved only when the major barriers, including the insulating nature of element sulfur and shuttling effect of polysulfides (Li2Sx, x = 3-8), are tackled. Here, nitrogen, sulfur-codoped (N,S-codoped) sponge-like graphene, which presents a high reversible capacity, is used as electroactive interlayer for Li-S batteries to address these issues. An impressive high capacity of 2193.2 mAh g(-1) can be obtained for the sulfur cathodes with such an interlayer at the rate of 0.2C, and it can be stably maintained at 829.4 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 6C, for which the contribution from the electroactive interlayer is ca. 30.0%. High energy density of 418.5 Wh Kg(-1) still can be released at the power density of 4.55 kW kg(-1) (6C) based on the total mass of the sulfur cathode and interlayer for the assembled Li-S batteries.

Here, an integrated solar-driven rechargeable lithium-sulfur battery system using a joint carbon electrode in one structure unit is proposed. Specifically, three perovskite solar cells are assembled serially in a single substrate to photocharge a high energy lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, accompanied by direct conversion of the solar energy to chemical energy. In the subsequent discharge process, the chemical energy stored in the Li-S battery is further converted to electrical energy. Therefore, the newly designed battery is capable of achieving solar-tochemical energy conversion under solar-driven conditions, and subsequently delivering electrical energy from the stored chemical energy. With an optimized structure design, a high overall energy conversion efficiency of 5.14% is realized for the integrated battery. Moreover, owing to the self-adjusting photocharge advantage, the battery system can retain high specific capacity up to 762.4 mAh g(-1) under a high photocharge rate within 30 min, showing an effective photocharging feature.

However, the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries is still hindered by fast capacity fading and poor cycling stability. In this work, CeO(2-)webbed carbon nanotubes (CeO2@ CNT) is designed and synthesized by solvothermal reaction and used as a conceptually new sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries. In this unique architecture, the carbon nanotubes form a three-dimension porous conductive network to provide fast electron paths. In addition, the nanosized CeO2 crystallites can chemically bind polysulfides to suppress the polysufides diffusion into electrolyte. As a result, the lithium-sulfur batteries based on this electrode material exhibit high specific capacity, superior cycling stability, and good rate capability. Reversible specific capacities of 1359 and 715 mAh g(-1) are achieved at rates of 0.1 and 1C, respectively, together with an excellent cycling stability of 0.07% capacity decay per cycle over 600 cycles at 0.5 C.

This study reports a unique and innovative solution to capitalize on a currently overlooked resource to produce high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries from recycled paper. The recycled paper fibers are creatively composited with graphene oxide sheets via a capillary adsorption method. The recycled paper/graphene oxide hybrid is then converted to activated paper carbon/reduced graphene oxide (APC/graphene) scaffold for sulfur infiltration. The assembled Li-APC/graphene/S battery exhibits a superior lifespan of 620 cycles with an excellent capacity retention rate of 60.5%. An APC interlayer is sandwiched between the Li anode and the separator to suppress the degradation of Li anode by preventing the nonhomogeneous growth of mossy Li whiskers, stretching the battery lifespan up to 1000 cycles with a capacitance retention rate of 52.3%. The capillary adsorption method coupled with the porous carbonaceous anode interlayer configuration creates a new opportunity for the development of batteries derived from porous biomass materials.

Much work has been done to construct nanostructured or doped carbon as a porous or polar host for promising sulfur cathodes, although restricting the polysulfide shuttle effect by improving the redox reaction kinetics is more attractive. Herein, we present a well-designed strategy by introducing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) into a three-dimensional hierarchical porous graphene assembly to achieve a synergistic combination of confinement and catalyzation of polysulfides. The porous g-C3N4 nanosheets in situ formed inside the graphene network afford a highly accessible surface to catalyze the transformation of polysulfides, and the hierarchical porous graphene-assembled carbon can function as a conductive network and provide appropriate space for g-C3N4 catalysis in the sulfur cathode. Thus, this hybrid can effectively improve sulfur utilization and block the dissolution of polysulfides, achieving excellent cycling performance for sulfur cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, porous bamboo biochar is activated via a KOH/annealing process that creates a microporous structure, boosts surface area and enhances electronic conductivity. The treated sample is used to encapsulate sulfur to prepare a microporous bamboo carbon-sulfur (BC-S) nanocomposite for use as the cathode for Li-S batteries for the first time. The BC-S nanocomposite with 50 wt.% sulfur content delivers a high initial capacity of 1,295 mA center dot h/g at a low discharge rate of 160 mA/g and high capacity retention of 550 mA center dot h/g after 150 cycles at a high discharge rate of 800 mA/g with excellent coulombic efficiency (a (c) 3/495%). This suggests that the BC-S nanocomposite could be a promising cathode material for Li-S batteries.

The mesoporous carbon was prepared with sucrose as carbon precursor and calcium carbonate nanoparticles as pore producer. The sulfur was encapsulated in the mesoporous carbon via a simple chemical deposition strategy and a subsequent low-temperature thermal treatment process. The morphology and structure of the resulting composite were characterized with scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurement, and thermogravimetric analysis. Its electrochemical performances as cathode of lithium/sulfur battery were evaluated with cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge test. The prepared carbon showed a specific surface area of 598 m(2) g(-1) with a bimodal pore distribution centered at 3.6 and 40 nm. The resulting mesoporous carbon-sulfur delivered an initial capacity of 1,380 mAh g(-1) at 0.02 C and maintained a capacity of 750 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C.

Here we report an unusual cathode configuration for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries employing B4C nanowires (BC-NWs) as a skeleton, porous activated cotton textile (ACT) as a flexible carbon scaffold, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a self-adaptive protective shell. This BC-NWs@ACT/S/rGO cathode achieved superlative sulfur confinement and electrochemical performance with excellent cycling stability (over 1000 cycles at a high current density of 1.5 mA/cm(2)), an ultralow capacity decay rate (0.056% per cycle) and remarkable capacities at a wide range of discharging rate from 0.1 to 1.5 mA/cm(2), demonstrating its potential to achieve high capacity and long cycle life simultaneously in Li-S batteries.

Sulfur is loaded into nanohybrid to produce an outstanding Li-S battery cathode through integrating the advantages and avoiding the disadvantages of graphene and MnS. The optimized cathode can deliver a higher capacity of 756 m Ah g(-1) at 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mAg(-1) ) after 200 cycles and can retain 73% of the initial capacity, which indicates a potential applicable cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Of these next-generation batteries, lithium sulfur (Li-S) chemistry is among the most commercially mature, with cells offering a substantial increase in gravimetric energy density, reduced costs and improved safety prospects. However, there remain outstanding issues to advance the commercial prospects of the technology and benefit from the economies of scale felt by Li-ion cells, including improving both the rate performance and longevity of cells. To address these challenges, the Faraday Institution, the UK's independent institute for electrochemical energy storage science and technology, launched the Lithium Sulfur Technology Accelerator (LiSTAR) programme in October 2019. This Roadmap, authored by researchers and partners of the LiSTAR programme, is intended to highlight the outstanding issues that must be addressed and provide an insight into the pathways towards solving them adopted by the LiSTAR consortium. In compiling this Roadmap we hope to aid the development of the wider Li-S research community, providing a guide for academia, industry, government and funding agencies in this important and rapidly developing research space.

Its commercial progress is impeded by its poor electrical conductivity and high dissolubility of intermediate products in organic electrolyte. In the present work, we report a novel three-dimensional graphene-wrapped porous carbon (3D-G) to accommodate sulfur, which consists of outside highly stable interconnected graphene-like sheets and inner activated porous carbon. The 3D-G was synthesized from cheap polyacrylic acid cation-exchange resin, which introduces nickel ions as catalysts in the carbonization process, as a cost effective, facile and simple method. This 3D-G showed hierarchical pores: 0.7 nm micropores and macropores, providing a large specific surface area of 1375.08 m(2) g(-1). Benefiting from this unique structure, the 3D-G performed well as host materials to achieve a high sulfur content (75.4 wt%). Such a 3D-G@S composite exhibits capacity-fading rate as low as 0.28% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.1 C, and good cyclability at various cycling rates (0.1-1 C).

However, the capacity decay and kinetic sluggishness stemming from polysulfide shuttle effects have by far posed a great challenge to practical performance. We herein demonstrate the employment of low-cost, wet-chemistry-derived VO2 nanobelts as the effective host additives for the graphene-based sulfur cathode. The VO2 nanobelts displayed an ultrafast anchoring behavior of polysulfides, managing to completely decolor the polysulfide solution in 50 s. Such a fast and strong anchoring ability of VO2 was further investigated and verified by experimental and theoretical investigations. Benefitting from the synergistic effect exerted by VO2 in terms of chemical confinement and catalytic conversion of polysulfides, the Li-S batteries incorporating VO2 and graphene manifested excellent cycling and rate performances. Notably, the batteries delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1405 mAh g(-1)when cycling at 0.2 C, showed an advanced rate performance of similar to 830 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, and maintained a stable cycling performance at high current densities of 1, 2, and 5 C over 200 cycles, paving a practical route toward cost-effective and environmentally benign cathode design for high-energy Li-S batteries.

After sulfur is infused into this composite, the electrode delivers an initial capacity of 1,359.7 mA h g (1) at 0.1C (1st cycle), and maintains a specific capacity of 629.3 mA h g (1) for 150 cycles at 0.5C for lithium-sulfur batteries. The improved electrochemical performances are attributed to the capping effect exerted by N-doping for polysulfides and high electrical conductivity of the carbon framework with highly conductive graphene.

Although many structure innovations at the material and device levels have been explored for the ultimate goal of realizing long cycle life of Li-S batteries, it remains a major challenge to achieve stable cycling while avoiding energy and power density compromises caused by the introduction of significant dead weight/volume and increased electrochemical resistance. Here we introduce an ultrathin composite film consisting of naphthalimide-functionalized poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and graphene oxide nanosheets as a cycling stabilizer. Combining the dendrimer structure that can confine polysulfide intermediates chemically and physically together with the graphene oxide that renders the film robust and thin (<1% of the thickness of the active sulfur layer), the composite film is designed to enable stable cycling of sulfur cathodes without compromising the energy and power densities. Our sulfur electrodes coated with the composite film exhibit very good cycling stability, together with high sulfur content, large areal capacity, and improved power rate.

However, ready lithium polysulfide (LiPS) diffusion and sluggish redox kinetics hamper their cyclability and rate capability. Herein, porphyrin-derived graphene-based nanosheets (PNG) are proposed for Li-S batteries, which are achieved by pyrolyzing a conformal and thin layer of 2D porphyrin organic framework on graphene to form carbon nanosheets with a spatially engineered nitrogen-dopant-enriched skin and a highly conductive skeleton. The atomic skin is decorated with fully exposed lithiophilic sites to afford strong chemisorption to LiPSs and improve electrolyte wettability, while graphene substrate provides speedy electron transport to facilitate redox kinetics of sulfur species. The use of PNG as a lightweight interlayer enables efficient operation of Li-S batteries in terms of superb cycle stability (cyclic decay rate of 0.099% during 300 cycles at 0.5 C), good rate capability (988 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C), and impressive sulfur loading (areal capacity of 8.81 mAh cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of 8.9 mg cm(-2)). The distinct interfacial strategy is expected to apply to other conversion reaction batteries relying on dissolution-precipitation mechanisms and requiring interfacial charge- and mass-transport-mediation concurrently.

However, they often suffer from sluggish conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) during the charge/discharge process. Single nickel (Ni) atoms on nitrogen-doped graphene (Ni@NG) with Ni-N-4 structure are prepared and introduced to modify the separators of Li-S batteries. The oxidized Ni sites of the Ni-N-4 structure act as polysulfide traps, efficiently accommodating polysulfide ion electrons by forming strong S-x(2-)...Ni-N bonding. Additionally, charge transfer between the LiPS and oxidized Ni sites endows the LiPS on Ni@NG with low free energy and decomposition energy barrier in an electrochemical process, accelerating the kinetic conversion of LiPS during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the large binding energy of LiPS on Ni@NG also shows its ability to immobilize the LiPS and further suppresses the undesirable shuttle effect. Therefore, a Li-S battery based on a Ni@NG modified separator exhibits excellent rate performance and stable cycling life with only 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. It affords fresh insights for developing single-atom catalysts to accelerate the kinetic conversion of LiPS for highly stable Li-S batteries.

The flexible lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is considered to be a promising candidate due to its high energy density and low cost. Herein, a flexible Li-S battery was fabricated based on an all-in-one integrated configuration, where a multiwalled carbon nanotubes/sulfur (MWCNTs/S) cathode, MWCNTs/manganese dioxide (MnO2) interlayer, polypropylene (PP) separator, and Li anode were integrated together by combining blade coating with vacuum evaporation methods. Each component of the all-in-one structure can be seamlessly connected with the neighboring layers. Such an optimal interfacial connection can effectively enhance electron- and/or load-transfer capacity by avoiding the relative displacement or detachment between two neighboring components at bending strain. Therefore, the flexible all-in-one Li-S batteries display fast electrochemical kinetics and have stable electrochemical performance under different bending states.

But low rate performance and poor cycle stability arising from the poor electronic conductivity and the shuttling of polysulfide intermediates hamper its practical application. In order to address these shortcomings, hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) derived from peanut shells is employed as a host to accommodate sulfur for the first time. As-prepared HPC possesses a hierarchically porous structure with a relatively high specific surface area of 1775.7m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 1.457 cm(3) g(-1). When as-prepared HPC was employed as cathode hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries, it was found that S/HPC composite displayed an excellent electrochemical performance. The initial discharge capacity of 1659.8mAh g(-1) is reached at 0.5C and a reversible capacity of 815.7mAh g(-1) can be maintained after 100 cycles. Even if the current density increases to 3C, the specific capacity still is as high as 736.9mAh g(-1).

In the interlayer, the edge of MoS2 has insufficient molybdenum-sulfur bonding coordination and has adjustable active sites. These sites can effectively limit the transfer of polysulfides by chemisorption. Meanwhile, graphene has excellent electrical conductivity and extremely large specific surface area making it a promising candidate for modifying electrodes in lithium-sulfur battery. The MoS2/G composite is used as an interlayer for a carbon nanotubes/sulfur (CNTs/S) cathode. A lithium-sulfur battery fabricated from MoS2/G interlayer delivers a high discharge capacity of 1537.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. In addition, the discharge of the carbon nanotubes/sulfur@MoS2/G (CNTs/S@MoS2/G) can also remain 984.9 mAh g(-1) after 450 cycles with a lower capacity decay of 0.061% per cycle at 0.5 C, exhibiting a fantastic rate performance. The CNTs/S@MoS2/G cathode shows excellent electrochemical performance, which provides a promising strategy for the developing of highly stable and commercial lithium-sulfur batteries.

The obtained nanofibrous activated carbon was used as a host to further impregnated with sulfur to form the activated-carbon/sulfur composites for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The activated-carbon/sulfur composite with a sulfur content of 49.4 wt% exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1393 mA h g(-1) and stabilized at 576 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 0.1 C after 100 cycles. And a good rate capability with a reversible capacity of 789 mA h g(-1) was obtained at 0.1 C after 100 charge/discharge cycles. The improvements of the cycling stability and rate capability of the activated-carbon/sulfur composites are attributed to the unique three-dimensional conductive network structures and the high surface area of the nanofibrous activated carbon scaffolds, which not only effectively restrain the dissolution and diffusion of the polysulfide during the discharge process, as well as accommodate the large volume expansion in the formation process of S to Li2S in the lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, their S cathodes are harassed by the poor conductivity, shuttling of lithium polysulfides (LPSs), and large volume change. In improving conductivity of S cathodes, carbon materials are widely used as conductive additives. However, there still lacks a comparative study on their geometric and structural effects in Li-S batteries. To this end, a systematic investigation is conducted on two different typical conductive additives, carbon black (CB)(1) and nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (N-GNS)(2). This work reveals that, compared to the zero-dimensional (OD) CB nanoparticles, the two-dimensional (2D) N-GNS is structurally less defective and has a larger surface area. As a result, the 2D structure of the N-GNS helps achieve higher capacity retention but inhibits Li-ion transportation. In comparison, the OD structure of the CB facilitates the transportation of Li-ions with a higher initial capacity but exposed to a severer shuttling behavior of LPSs. It is also found that a combination of the CB and N-GNS enables better performance of Li-S batteries, in terms of sustainable capacity, Coulombic efficiency, and rate capability. This study is inspiring for designing better S cathodes for Li-S batteries.

To enhance rate performance of sulfur cathode for Li-S batteries, a carbon material consisted of non-uniform carbon spheres has been prepared by hydrothermal method. Sulfur disperses evenly on the surface of the carbon spheres via a melt-diffusion method. The as-prepared composite with a sulfur content of 52wt% delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1 174 mAh.g(-1) and a reversible discharge capacity of 788 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C. At a higher rate of 4C, the capacity stabilizes at around 600 mAh.g(-1). During cycling, the coulombic efficiency is maintained above 90%. The results show that the carbon-sulfur composites with chain conductive network represents a promising cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries because of the effective improvement of the electronic conductivity, the restraint of the volume expansion and the reduction of the shuttle effect.

However, one of the daunting challenges remained for advanced Li-S systems thus far deals with the synchronous suppression of polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle and acceleration of redox kinetics. Herein, a cooperative interface bridging adsorptive V2O3 and conductive graphene is constructed in-situ by virtue of direct plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), resulting in the design of a novel V2O3-graphene hybrid host to synergize the LiPS entrapment and conversion. The redox kinetics and electrochemical performances of thus-derived cathodes were accordingly enhanced owing to the smooth adsorption-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs even at a sulfur mass loading of 3.7 mg cm(-2). Such interfacial engineering offers us a valuable opportunity to gain insight into the comprehensive regulation of LiPS anchoring ability, electrical conductivity and ion diffusive capability in hybrid hosts on suppressing the LiPS shuttle and propelling the redox kinetics. Our devised PECVD route might pave a new route toward the facial and economic design of hetero-phased multi-functional hosts for high-performance Li-S systems.

The reduction of graphene oxide and the formation/binding of sulfur nanocrystals were integrated. The G S hybrids exhibit a highly porous network structure constructed by fibrous graphene, many electrically conducting pathways, and easily tunable sulfur content, which can be cut and pressed into pellets to be directly used as lithium sulfur battery cathodes without using a metal current-collector, binder, and conductive additive. The porous network and sulfur nanocrystals enable rapid Ion transport and short Li+ diffusion distance, the Interconnected fibrous graphene provides highly conductive electron transport pathways, and the oxygen-containing (mainly hydroxyl/epoxide) groups show strong binding with polysulfides, preventing their dissolution into the electrolyte based on first-principles calculations. As a result, the G S hybrids show a high capacity, an excellent high-rate performance, and a long life over 100 cycles. These results demonstrate the great potential of this unique hybrid structure as cathodes for high-performance lithium sulfur batteries.

However, shuttle effect of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) dissolved in the electrolyte results in severe capacity fading and self-discharge. Herein, a multifunctional modifier composed of mesoporous boron carbon nitride and conductive graphene (BCN/G) has been developed to modify separator as an efficient barrier for LiPSs in LSBs. Benefiting from such a modified separator, LSBs exhibit improved cycling capacity and high rate capacities. The excellent electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to the strong chemical interactions between LiPSs and conductive BCN/G modifier, which have been confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. Such a design of separator opens a new approach for high-performance LSBs.

Admirably, as-prepared CuS/graphene composite endows enriched oxygen-functional groups and excellent electrical conductivity for cathode area. The introduction of CuS/graphene-coated separator effectively reduced the dissolution of lithium polysulfides as well as enhanced the integrity of the sulfur cathode for Li/S batteries. The cell with these modified separator delivered an enviable discharge capacity of 1302 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, as well as an excellent reversible capacity of 760 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. Furthermore, an outstanding rate capability of 568 mAh g(-1 )at 3.0 C has been achieved in the cell with CuS/graphene-coated separator.

Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S battery) based on elemental sulfur as cathode-active material is highly attractive due to their high theoretical efficiency, easy availability, low cost and non-toxicity of sulfur. Low technical conductivity of sulfur has led to many technical challenges, including dissolving sulfur-reducing products in the electrolyte, leading to their migration from the cathode, and the deposition of solid reaction products on the cathode matrix. In this method Heritage Algorithm is the full range of our heritage traditions, electrochemical, anode and cathode. Most importantly, it is a range of contemporary activities, meanings and behaviors. The parameters Initialize Cell Voltage, Default Energy, Capacity Density, and Battery Life Duration. When electrochemists create models, they usually do so as electrochemical reaction. The Electrochemical uses model flaws to identify gaps in current knowledge and as inspiration, Improve and get a 'better backup'. In contrast, during discharge lithium develops from between the carbon layers in the anodes and the compound layers at the cathodes are doped with lithium. Lithium-Ion rechargeable batteries at the cathodes and carbon at the anodes. Improve the environmental efficiency of battery manufacturing, and electric alloy with high production capacity and low carbon intensity is suggested. It is suggested to optimize this process by reducing power consumption during manufacturing and in combination with high pack energy density, by impacting climate change on pack manufacturing.

It can be used as a cathode material in lithium sulfur (Li/S) batteries. Giant-miscanthus-derived activated carbon (GMAC) is prepared via carbonization of GM followed by KOH activation. It is prepared with a large amount of KOH, and thus contained more defects but had a highly porous structure and graphitic cluster lattice. GMAC has a large specific surface area of 3327 m(2)/g and a large total pore volume of 1.86 cm(3)/g. The pore volume served as a storage space for the retention of polysulfides, thereby inhibiting the shuttle effect. When a GMAC-sulfur composite cathode is tested in a Li/S battery, an initial discharge capacity of 1148 mAh/g can be attained at 0.1 C. In a cyclic charge-discharge experiment at 1 C, discharge capacities of 529 mAh/g and 248 mAh/g are observed in the first and 200th cycles, respectively.

The key challenge for a flexible Li/S battery is to design a cathode with excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility. In this work, a flexible strap-like Li/S battery based on a S@carbon nanotube/Pt@carbon nanotube hybrid film cathode was designed. It delivers a specific capacity of 1145 mAhg(-1) at the firstcycle and retains a specific capacity of 822 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles. Moreover, the flexible Li/S battery retains stabile specific capacity and Coulombic efficiency even under severe bending conditions. As a demonstration of practical applications, an LED array is shown stably powered by the flexible Li/S battery under flattened and bent states. We also use the strap-like flexible Li/S battery as a real strap for a watch, which at the same time provides a reliable power supply to the watch.

However, the aggregation of graphene nanosheets inhibits their applications in lithium-sulfur batteries. Here we tackle this problem by designing a porous carbon wrapped graphene nanosheet (M-GN) via a facile IL-microemulsion method. During the Pickering emulsion process, graphene oxide (GO) serves as surfactant and the templates, while the hydrophobic ionic liquid ([BMIm][FeCl4]) stabilizes the GO and forms the emulsion environment. The electrostatic effect between negative graphene oxide (GO) and positive cation 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (BMIm(+)) helps to form a stabilized system, which can facilitate the uniform growth of the carbon layers on GO. The obtained S/M-GN cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of 1331 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and 757 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5C. The innovative IL-microemulsion method provides us with a new avenue for the synthesis of effective materials for energy storage devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, its practical application on a massive scale is impeded by severe capacity loss resulted from the notorious polysulfides shuttle. Here, we first present a novel technique to synthesize sandwich-type nitrogen and sulfur codoped graphene-backboned porous carbon (NSGPC) to modify the commercial polypropylene separator in Li-S batteries. The as-synthesized NSGPC exhibits a unique micro/mesoporous carbon framework, large specific surface area (2439.0 m(2) g(-1)), high pore volume (1.78 cm(3) g(-1)), good conductivity, and in situ nitrogen (1.86 at %) and sulfur (5.26 at %) co-doping. Benefiting from the particular physical properties and chemical components of NSGPC, the resultant NSGPC-coated separator not only can facilitate rapid Li+ ions and electrons transfer, but also can restrict the dissolution of polysulfides to alleviate the shuttle effect by combining the physical absorption and strong chemical adsorption. As a result, Li-S batteries with NSGPC-coated separator exhibit high initial reversible capacity (1208.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), excellent rate capability (596.6 mAh g(-1) at 5 C), and superior cycling stability (over 500 cycles at 2 C with 0.074% capacity decay each cycle). Propelling our easy-designed pure sulfur cathode to a extremely increased mass loading of 3.4 mg cm(-2) (70 wt. % sulfur), the Li-S batteries with this functional composite separator exhibit a superior high initial capacity of 1171.7 mAh g(-1), which is quite beneficial to commercialized applications.

To address this issue, we report on a multifunctional separator prepared by introducing a porous carbon/multi-walled carbon nanotube (PC/MWCNT) composite into a commercial separator. It shows that the PC/MWCNT composite is able to enhance the interfacial interaction between the coating and the polysulfide and provides a large surface area for absorbing the polysulfide, thus improving the electrical conductivity. It has been demonstrated that the Li-S cell constructed with the PC/MWCNT composite separator results in a reversible capacity as high as 659 mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, and the average capacity fading rate of the cell is about 0.138% per cycle. The performance improvement is attributed to a reduction in the crossover rate of polysulfide through the composite separator as a result of the polysulfide absorption by PC/MWCNT layer.

However, lithium-sulfur batteries could not be widely used in a large range due to the shuttle effect and sulfur insulation. Herein, we proposed a novel composite cathode of carbon nanotubes@manganese dioxide@sulfur@polypyrrole (C@MnO2@S@PPy). X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) BET analysis show that sulfur filled into the pores of C@MnO2, and PPy was successfully coated on C@MnO2@S. TG indicated that the compound contained 60wt% active sulfur. The prepared cathode of C@MnO2@S@PPy composites shows excellent rate performance and cycle stability. At a high rate of 1C, its maximum discharge capacity reached 1218mAhg-1 and its average capacity decreasing rate was only 0.096%/cycle when running over 500 cycles. The interaction mechanism of MnO2 with polysulfides was investigated by adsorption tests and XPS analysis. The excellent electrochemical performance might be due to a combination of adsorption or catalytic properties of MnO2 and the conductivity of carbon materials and PPy.

To develop long-cycle Li-S batteries, there is an urgent need for material structures with effective polysulfide binding capability and well-defined surface sites; thereby improving cycling stability and allowing study of molecular-level interactions. This challenge was addressed by introducing an organometallic molecular compound, ferrocene, as a new polysulfide-confining agent. With ferrocene molecules covalently anchored on graphene oxide, sulfur electrode materials with capacity decay as low as 0.014% per cycle were realized, among the best of cycling stabilities reported to date. With combined spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations, it was determined that effective polysulfide binding originates from favorable cation-p interactions between Li+ of lithium polysulfides and the negatively charged cyclopentadienyl ligands of ferrocene.

However, current Li-S cells face the capacity decay caused by the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. In this work, a new material concept, namely the layer @ adsorbent is introduced to address the capacity fading problem. This architecture utilizes mesoporous SiO2 holding sulfur and polysulfides and the whole S fused SiO2 was intimately encapsulated by reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Benefiting from the enhanced capillary force from SiO2, as well as the improved conductivity from RGO chamber, this layer @ adsorbent architecture could easily spread and adsorb polysulfides. The initial discharge capacity is approaching its theoretical capacity (1567mAhg(-1) at 0.1C). A stable cycle performance over 500 cycles is demonstrated with the capacity loss of merely about 0.05% per cycle. Additionally, the cathode with higher sulfur content (67%) delivers a stable reversible capacity (400mAhg(-1)) over 500 cycles at higher current of 2C.

However, its application is limited by the shuttle effect of polysulfides. In this work, the reduced graphene oxide/carbon black co-modified separator is fabricated using the vacuum filtration method. The initial discharge specific capacity of lithium-sulfur battery with reduced graphene oxide/carbon black (1:1) separator reaches 1014.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and the capacity decay rate is only 0.17% per cycle, which shows excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, the capacity retention ratio is 75.47% at 1 C after 500 cycles. Particularly, it shows outstanding performance at high current density, and the specific capacity keeps at 612.2 mAh g(-1) even at 5 C. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the physical adsorption of abundant pores and the chemical adsorption of hydroxyl functional group, providing strong capability for trap polysulfides. The co-modified separator not only serves as trapper to inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides, but also acts as upper current collector for the reuse of captured polysulfides. This simple and controllable preparation method can be applied in the design of long-cycle life and high power density of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we introduced graphene-like g-C3N4 nanosheets (GCN), a sheet-like material with high nitrogen (N) content of 56 wt % and high specific surface area of 209.8 m(2) g(-1), as a host to anchor lithium polysulfides. The composite with 70.4 wt % sulfur loading exhibited an initial reversible capacity of 1250 mA h g(-1) at 0.05C and a discharge capacity of 578.0 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C over 750 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performances can be attributed to the abundant N atoms in the GCN, which have the ability to anchor lithium polysulfides. Meanwhile, the high surface area of the GCN prevent sulfur, Li2S2 and Li2S from agglomerating.

Sawdust reacted with Fe(NO3)(3) at low temperatures to form a transition metal carbide (Fe3C) core and a graphitic carbon (GC) shell. With the dissolution of Fe3C, PGC with a hollow core and GC shell was formed. This PGC was employed as the sulfur reservoir for lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The PGC/S composite showed excellent capacity retention and cycling performance. The initial discharge capacity of PGC/S cell was 1235 mAh g(-1) and the capacity retention was 800 mAh g(-1) after 20 cycles at 0.1 C. The cell also delivered a capacity retention of 405 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 150 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the PGC/S composite can be attributed to its unique porous structure. The hollow structure provided sufficient space to accommodate sulfur and confine polysulfides, and the graphitic shell improved the conductivity of the electrode and facilitated rapid electron transfer in it. Therefore, the PGC/S composite was found to be a promising cathode material for Li-S batteries with excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, the low-cost, green, and facile preparation process used in this study for the PGC matrix can be used for fabricating high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the practical implementation of Li-S batteries is impeded by several intractable obstacles including the poor conductivity of sulfur, shuttling behaviour of polysulfides intermediates, and large volume change during sulfur lithiation. Thus, the rational design and morphological control of sulfur cathode paves the way to Li-S batteries practicalizations. Herein, we develop a blackberry-like hollow graphene sphere through spray drying method as a promising sulfur host for Li-S batteries. Attributed to the uniform sulfur distribution, fast reaction kinetics, and excellent sulfur immobilization, the S-HGS composite electrode achieves a highly reversible capacity of 780 mAh g(-1), a great rate capability as well as cyclability without adding additives.

However, the insulating property of sulfur and severe polysulfides shuttle effect tremendously hinder their practical applications. Herein, a N, P dual-doped 3D hierarchical porous hybrid carbon is successfully prepared for advanced Li-S batteries based on the combination of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and goat hair derived biomass carbon (rGO/GPC) by a simple one-pot pyrolysis process. A proper amount of rGO (3%) decorated biomass carbon (rGO/GPC-2) possesses a N, P dualdoped 3D robust porous framework and good electrical conductivity, which can effectively improve the sulfur utilization and immobilize the polysulfides through both physical restriction and chemical adsorption. The as-fabricated rGO/GPC-2-S composite used as Li-S batteries cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1420 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintains a reversible capacity of 503mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0 C with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.070% per cycle and excellent rate performance with 500 mAh g(-1 )at 2.0 C. The enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the positive synergistic effect of N, P-dual doped polar porous structure and nonpolar highly conductive hybrid carbon matrix.

In this work, a novel and facile biological self-assembly technology to fabricate multifunctional Rhizopus hyphae carbon fiber (RHCF) and its derivatives on a large scale for electrochemical energy storage is proposed. Crosslinked hollow carbon fibers are successfully prepared by conversion of Rhizopus hyphae, and macroscopic production of centimeter-level carbon balls consisting of hollow RHCFs is further realized. Moreover, the self-assembled RHCF balls show strong adsorption characteristics on metal ions and can be converted into a series of derivatives such as RHCF/metal oxides. Notably, the designed RHCF derivatives are demonstrated with powerful multifunctionability as cathode, anode, and separator for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). The RHCF can act as the host material to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form a new RHCF/CoO-S cathode, an RHCF/Li anode, and an RHCF/PP separator, respectively. Consequently, the optimized LSB full cell presents excellent cycling performance and superior high-rate capacity (881.3 mA h g(-1) at 1 C). This work provides a new method for large-scale preparation of hollow carbon fibers and derivatives for advanced energy storage and conversion.

The three-dimensional conductive network formed by highly conductive few layers graphene provides electron transfer channel, thus promoting the high capacity performance of lithiumsulfur batteries. The metal oxides distributed uniformly on the surface of graphene exhibit strong interaction towards polysulfides, which can restrain the dissolution of polysulfides and shuttle effect and promote the cycling performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the Li-S battery still faces a host of problems, mainly connected to its poor cycling performance due to the "shuttle effect". As they show strong chemical absorption and are reaction sites to polysulfide species, sulfiphilic hosts are used in cathode material. For this paper, tin sulfide (SnS2) nanoplates were incorporated with a 3D graphene network using a simple hydrothermal method and a reduction process. After the infiltration of sulfur, the S/rGO-SnS2 exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1150.1 mAh g(-1) and excellent stability after 100 cycles (844.6 mAh g(-1)). The superior stability and reversibility is due to the synergy between the high-active sulfiphilic SnS2 and high-conductivity 3D graphene network. This result shows a potential approach to the application of Li-S batteries.

Herein, a scalable synthesis is presented to produce highly porous, nitrogen-doped carbons from a commercial carbon black material by melamine impregnation and subsequent thermolysis. The process up-scaling up was demonstrated at > 100 g batch level. The nitrogen doping was controlled through pyrolysis temperatures and carbon to melamine ratio. The sulfurcarbon cathodes exhibit an enhanced cycle life at a moderate electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 7 mu L mgs(-1). In particular, under lean conditions at low electrolyte amount of 5 mu L mgs(-1) , the nitrogen functionalities improved active material utilization and capacity retention significantly.

This paper demonstrates the construction of Nafion@graphdiyne core-shell nanostructure, which first embeds a polyanion (Nafion) seamlessly in an all-carbon nanostructure of graphdiyne. The graphdiyne acts as the conductive and mechanical backbone to store sulfur and offers active epicenters (sp-hybridized carbon) for the cathodic reaction. The embedded Nafion greatly enhances the inner mass transfer behavior in the primary nanostructure, thus improves the phase transformation reaction, leading to the efficient suppression of the polysulfides shuttle. The Li-S battery incorporating such core-shell nanostructure performs high retention in its capacity even after 800 cycles at high current densities (0.5C and 1C). A high volume capacity of 1832 A h L-1, which is 53% of the theoretical value of sulfur is obtained succesfully. This core-shell nanostructure appears to produce new phenomena, properties, and functions. It can be applicable in, for example, catalysis, fuel cells, and supercapacitors, as well as batteries.

However, the "shuttle effect" caused by the dissolving of polysulfide in the electrolyte has greatly hindered the widespread commercial use of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this paper, a novel two-dimensional TiS2/graphene heterostructure is theoretically designed as the anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries to suppress the shuttle effect. This heterostructure formed by the stacking of graphene and TiS2 monolayer is the van der Waals type, which retains the intrinsic metallic electronic structure of graphene and TiS2 monolayer. Graphene improves the electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode, and the transferred electrons from graphene enhance the polarity of the TiS2 monolayer. Simulations of the polysulfide adsorption show that the TiS2/graphene heterostructure can maintain good metallic properties and the appropriate adsorption energies of 0.98-3.72 eV, which can effectively anchor polysulfides. Charge transfer analysis suggests that further enhancement of polarity is beneficial to reduce the high proportion of van der Waals (vdW) force in the adsorption energy, thereby further enhancing the anchoring ability. Low Li2S decomposition barrier and Li-ion migration barrier imply that the heterostructure has the ability to catalyze fast electrochemical kinetic processes. Therefore, TiS2/graphene heterostructure could be an important candidate for ideal anchoring materials of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Graphene sheet-encased silica/sulfur composite cathode for improved cyclability of lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Composite material; Cathode; Shuttle effect; Graphene oxide	BLACK COMPOSITE; DOPED CARBON; PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN; MICROSPHERES; NA3MNCO3PO4; CAPACITY; DIOXIDE; AEROGEL; HOST	The "shuttle effect" of polysulfides is a serious issue, resulting in a decrease in the life-cycle of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. To inhibit the shuttle effect, a combination of graphene oxide and silica has been adopted in this work. Here, two different ratios of sulfur/silicon dioxide/partially reduced graphene oxide (S/SiO2/prGO - 70:20:10 and 70:10:20) composite materials were prepared via a melt diffusion method and were used as a cathode for a Li-S battery. The wrinkled sheets of partially reduced graphene oxide not only provide a conductive network for electron transport, but also ease the volume changes of active material during cycling. The 20 wt% of prGO present in the S/SiO2/prGO cathode delivers initial discharge capacity of 783 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and remains at 491 mAh g(-1) over 300 cycles, with low capacity decay rate of 0.12% per cycle. The better electrochemical performance indicates that the electrode containing 20 wt% of prGO with silica effectively suppresses the "shuttle effect" of polysulfide dissolution.

However, the low capacity reversibility and poor rate capability still pose a significant hurdle on their real-world applications. Here, a freestanding thin-film composite containing sulfurized polyacrylonitrile with conductive backbone of carbon nanotubes has been fabricated by an electrospinning method followed by vulcanization, and employed as the binder-free cathode for lithium sulfur batteries without any aid of current collectors. A synergic effect from sulfur and carbon nanotubes, when co-spun together, has been discovered on promoting the electrochemical performance of the cathodes by simultaneously creating material porosity and conductive pathway. The optimized composite fibers made from a ternary precursor solution containing 20% carbon nanotubes present the best performance, delivering a high initial discharge capacity of 1610 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and outstanding cycle stability of 1106 mAh g(-1) at 1C over 500 cycles. It is anticipated that the porous composite nanofibers and the multivariant fabrication methodology reported here can be extended to more energy storage applications, particularly for flexible lithium sulfur batteries.

To solve these issues, herein we design a three-dimensional graphene-like matrix composited with nanoscale iron oxide as a host for sulfur, which can be easily synthesized from citric acid under the reaction of ferric chloride via a simple one-step route. The as-prepared graphene-like matrix with a large specific surface area and an ordered space structure can host more sulfur, provide more space for sulfur expansion, and improve electrical conductivity. In addition, the polar nitrogen and iron oxide nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of the carbon sheet strongly adsorb polysulfides to minimize the shuttle effect. On the basis of the above design, the electrode delivers an initial specific capacity of 1196 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and a discharge capacity of 829 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C after 300 cycles. This work will provide a promising direction for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries, especially in practical industrialization applications.

However, the diffusion of polysulfides from cathode to anode leads to poor electrochemical stability of Li-S batteries, which is a main factor that restricts their further development. Herein, for the first time we present a separator with nitrogen-doped porous hollow carbon sphere (NHC) coating, with which Li-S cells enormously improve the utilization of active material and enhance excellent electrochemical performance. An initial discharge capacity of 1656 mAh g(-1) (0.2 C) and a low fading rate of 0.11% per cycle within 500 cycles (1 C) are achieved, which ascribe to the chemical and physical adsorption properties of porous and nitrogen-doped NHCs. The NHC-decorated separator is of low cost and can effectively improve energy density of Li-S cells, exhibiting potential for further development of Li S batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We employed a facile self-emulsifying synthesis to obtain sub-micrometer novolac-derived carbon beads with nanopores. After pyrolysis, the carbon beads showed already a specific surface area of 640 m(2) g(-1) which was increased to 2080 m(2) g(-1) after physical activation. The non-activated and the activated carbon beads represent nanoporous carbon with a medium and a high surface area, respectively. This allows us to assess the influence of the porosity on the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur battery cathodes. The carbon/sulfur hybrids were obtained from two different approaches of sulfur infiltration: melt-infusion of sulfur (annealing) and in situ formation of sulfur from sodium thiosulfate. The best performance (similar to 880 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) at low charge rate; 5th cycle) and high performance stability (> 600 mAh g(sulfur) (-1) after 100 cycles) were found for the activated carbon beads when using melt infusion of sulfur.

The cathodes are fabricated using porous carbon materials obtained from hybrid materials synthesized by twin polymerization on sulfonated polystyrene microparticles. The sulfonic acid groups act as room temperature catalyst for twin polymerization resulting in the formation of nanostructured phenolic resin/silica hybrid materials on the surface of sulfonated polystyrene particles. The shell formed by phenolic resin is transformed into carbon by simple pyrolysis and the polystyrene core is decomposed simultaneously at the pyrolysis temperature yielding porous carbon/silica nanocomposite hollow spheres. After silica removal, a hierarchical, highly porous carbon is obtained. Melt mixing of the carbon with sulfur is used for the fabrication of cathodes for Li-S batteries. The presence of silica on one hand imposes strength to the sphere wall during the carbonization and depolymerization of polystyrene, and on the other hand generates microporous carbon material for lithium-sulfur batteries. The nanostructured hybrid cathode allows very high capacity of 800-1000 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) and remarkable reversible cycling stability and rate capability over 200 cycles at 0.1C rate and over 440 cycles at 1C rate for Li-S batteries.

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and poor conductivity of sulfur are still vital issues that constrain their specific capacity and cyclic stability. Here, we design coaxial MnO2-graphitic carbon hollow nanofibers as sulfur hosts for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. The hollow C/MnO2 coaxial nanofibers are synthesized via electrospinning and carbonization of the carbon nanofibers (CNFs), followed by an in situ redox reaction to grow MnO2 nanosheets on the surface of CNFs. The inner graphitic carbon layer not only maintains intimate contact with sulfur and outer MnO2 shell to significantly increase the overall electrical conductivity but also acts as a protective layer to prevent dissolution of polysulfides. The outer MnO2 nanosheets restrain the shuttle effect greatly through chemisorption and redox reaction. Therefore, the robust S@C/MnO2 nanofiber cathode delivers an extraordinary rate capability and excellent cycling stability with a capacity decay rate of 0.044 and 0.051% per cycle after 1000cycles at 1.0C and 2.0C, respectively. Our present work brings forward a new facile and efficient strategy for the functionalization of inorganic metal oxide on graphitic carbons as sulfur hosts for high performance Li-S batteries.

The ACNF with tunable pore structure is fabricated by a combination of electrospinning polyimide and a subsequent activation treatment. The influence of the textual characteristics of ACNFs on the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries has been studied. The highly porous ACNF not only effectively intercepts/stabilizes the shuttling migration of polysulfides within the cathode region, but also provides reliable ionic/electronic conductivity for fast kinetics. The lightweight ACNF interlayer with higher specific surface area can yield enhanced cell performance at a low mass ratio of ACNF/sulfur (0.4). An initial specific capacity of 1224 mAh g(-1) along with high Coulombic efficiency, long cycling stability and good rate capability is achieved in the modified Li-S cell. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

But poor cycle performance has hindered its practical application. In this paper, the developing levels of lithium sulfur battery are introduced concisely. The important progress on the cathode materials, electrolytes, lithium anode and new battery composition of this battery system are reviewed. Furthermore, some investigation results in recent 5 years in this field of Chemical Defense Institute are mainly introduced. Firstly, two kinds of cathode materials, conducting polymer sulfides and mesoporous carbon/sulfur composites were prepared which improved the sulfur utilization and cycle performance. Compared with conducting polymer sulfides, mesoporous carbon/sulfur composites can embody more sulfur, so were preferable to high energy batteries. Secondly, an electrochemically stable binder, gelatin binder also functioned as a highly adhesive agent and an effective disperser was applied in lithium sulfur batteries. A novel porous sulfur cathode with the gelatin binder was prepared by using a freeze-drying method. Thirdly, a suitable electrolyte composition were investigated. Fourthly, the interface performance of lithium anode in lithium sulfur battery were studied. Integrating these technologies, the prototype polymer battery was assembled. It presented the energy density of more than 300Wh/kg, and showed about 60% remaining capacity after 100 cycles at 100% DOD. Finally, the prospects of the future research on lithium sulfur batteries are proposed.

Catalysis, which can promote the fast conversion of LiPSs, is a promising solution to the abovementioned problem. In this work, ultrasmall WS2 nanoclusters with the size around 2 nm are synthesized, with graphene as the growth template. The ultrasmall WS2 nanoclusters have abundant exposed edges and numerous unsaturated sulfur sites, which significantly enhance the adsorption ability toward LiPSs and render a high catalytic activity for their fast conversion. In addition, the three-dimensional structure assembled with graphene also provides a highly conductive network and large surface area for the fast conversion of LiPSs. As a result, the Li-S battery using the abovementioned hybrid as a catalytic sulfur host shows a low capacity fading of 0.067% per cycle within 250 cycles at 1 C. With the sulfur loading of 2.7 mg cm(-2), a high capacity retention of 74.7% after 500 cycles is achieved. Overall, this work proposes a promising catalyst design to improve the performance of Li-S batteries.

Activated carbon (AC) is an ideal matrix for sulfur because of its high specific surface area, large pore volume, small-size nanopores, and simple preparation. In this work, through KOH activation, AC materials with different porous structure parameters were prepared using waste rapeseed shells as precursors. Effects of KOH amount, activated temperature, and activated time on pore structure parameters of ACs were studied. AC sample with optimal pore structure parameters was investigated as sulfur host materials. Applied in lithium-sulfur batteries, the AC/S composite (60 wt % sulfur) exhibited a high specific capacity of 1065 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(- 1) and a good capacity retention of 49% after 1000 cycles at 1600 mA g(-1). The key factor for good cycling stability involves the restraining effect of small-sized nanopores of the AC framework on the diffusion of polysulfides to bulk electrolyte and the loss of the active material sulfur. Results demonstrated that AC materials derived from rapeseed shells are promising materials for sulfur loading.

Mesoporous carbon-sulfur composite microspheres are.. successfully synthesized by combining emulsion polymerization and the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) process. Such materials not only exhibit high sulfur-specific capacity and excellent retention as Li-S cathodes but also afford much improved tap density, sulfur content, and areal capacity necessary for practical development of high-energy-density Li-S batteries. In addition, when incorporated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form mesoporous carbon-CNT-sulfur composite microspheres, the material demonstrated superb battery performance even at a high current density of 2.8 mA/cm(2), with a reversible capacity over 700 mAh/g after 200 cycles.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are attracting much interest due to their high energy density. Therefore, flexible Li-S batteries with high areal capacity are desired. Herein, we fabricated freestanding reduced graphene oxide-sulfur (RGO@S) composite films with a cross-linked structure using a blade coating technique, followed by a subsequent chemical reduction. The porous cross-linked structure endows the composite films with excellent electrochemical performance. The batteries based on RGO@S composite films could exhibit a high discharge capacity of 1381 mAh/g at 0.1 C and excellent cycle stability. Furthermore, the freestanding composite film possesses excellent conductivity and high mechanical strength. Therefore, they can be used as the cathodes of flexible Li-S batteries. As a proof of concept, soft-packaged Li-S batteries were assembled and remained stable electrochemical performance under different bending states.

Here, we report a polydopamine (pDA) coated sulfur-carbon composite with a unique hierarchical tower-like structure (S-HTC@pDA) for lithium sulfur cathode. The internal layer by layer structure is capable of uniformly dispersing of sulfur, providing a continuous electronic conductive path and shortening the Li+ transport distance, while the external pDA coating can inhibit the diffusion of polysulfide. Benefited from the smart design, the S-HTC@pDA electrode achieved an excellent cycling stability, realizing a high discharge capacity of 916 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle and a capacity retention of 79.4% after 500 cycles at 1 C. Therefore, this work provides a new concept in structure design for high performance lithium sulfur cathodes. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the Li-S chemistry is a challenging topic due to the shuttle effect and the use of highly reactive lithium metal anode. To solve these issues, ultra-lightweight multilayered graphene coated paper separator is proposed as an interlayer. The interlayer is firstly coated on nickel foil by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method followed by transferring to the paper by fishing process. By employing this unique technique, a very light (similar to 8 mu g/cm(2)) graphene coating layer is obtained which does not further imply lowering the entire energy density of the cell. As a whole, the cell with graphene coated paper exhibits 610 mAh/g discharge capacity at C/5 after 100 cycles, while the cell without interlayer exhibits much poorer performance. The improved performance is mostly associated with the interaction between graphene and polysulfide species which is proven by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy measurement as well as the excellent electronic conductivity of graphene layer which behaves as a secondary current collector resulting the cell resistance decrease.

Here, by means of comprehensive density functional theory computations, we exploited the potentials of the experimentally available metal-nitrogen/graphene as the anchoring material for high-performance Li-S batteries. Our results revealed that Cr-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, and Cu-nitrogen/graphenes exhibit optimal interaction with soluble lithium polysulfides due to the synergistic effects between the metal and N atoms, which not only effectively traps the soluble lithium polysulfides to suppress the shuttle effects, but also well keeps their cyclic structures intact. Especially, the electronic properties of metal-nitrogen/graphenes are well preserved, and the computed voltages of discharge processes are larger than those of the well-established nitrogen-doped graphenes. Thus, the metal-nitrogen/graphene could present a kind of quite promising anchoring material for lithium sulfur battery cathodes to suppress the lithium polysulfides shuttle effect.

Through decades of research and development, people understand this system stepwisely. The electrochemistry of sulfur cathode is very complex and hard to be examined, which is the key point to develop lithium sulfur battery. Although there are many unknown mechanisms in the electrochemical process of charge/discharge of the lithium sulfur battery, some achievements have been made on the development of cathode materials which provide various sources to study. Sulfur is an insulating molecular crystal, carbon is added as the additive reagent to improve tie electric conductivity in the cathode, sulfur/carbon composite is common as cathode active material in lithium sulfur battery. Ethers and polymers are employed as the components of the electrolytes to coordinate with sulfur cathode. This paper reviews the achievements on lithium sulfur battery in the past decade from the respects of lithium sulfur battery system, cathode materials, electrolytes, cathode structure and new systems based on lithium sulfur battery. The weaknesses are revealed and the future is prospected.

A cathode constructed using a composite of sulfur and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) is a promising solution to both problems, as OMCs can have high conductivity and a complex pore structure to trap polysulfides. In this work, we demonstrate that performance of the Li-S battery can be significantly enhanced by using an OMC with a high degree of graphitization and a pore network with cubic symmetry. This graphitic OMC (GOMC) can be produced in a single step using iron phthalocyanine precursor and a silica template with cubic Ia3d symmetry. The GOMC-sulfur (GOMC/S) composite is 175% higher in electrical conductivity compared to the typical OMC-sulfur (OMC/S) composite. In addition, the three-dimensional pore network in GOMC prevents the migration of dissolved polysulfides. These characteristics of GOMC contribute to the improved rate capability and cyclability of the corresponding Li-S battery.

Effects of carbon hosts on composite structure and cell performance were attentively investigated. The hierarchically porous Ketjen black (ECP) owns higher specific surface area and pore volumes than Super P (SP), thus increasing active material utilization, but incapable of restraining rapid capacity fading. When carbon nanotube (CNT) was used for loading sulfur, sulfur can penetrate adequately into CNT and merge with it completely, which forms strong interaction between them. It helps to trap sulfur or reaction intermediates, and accommodates volume changes of sulfur upon cycling. Besides, the highly conductive CNT favors less polarization and better redox reversibility. These factors together promote electrochemical performance of the cathode. A high reversible capacity of 725 mAh g(-1) and capacity retention of similar to 80% (based on 2nd discharge) is obtained after 100 cycles for the CNTS composite. The work guides us how to treat rationally the porous structure when considering suitable carbon material for lithium sulfur batteries.

So it is considered to be the most promising cathode materials for the next generation batteries. However, Li-S is facing many problems that constrain its widespread application. The main obstacles are its poor conductivity, volume expanding. Moreover, sulfur can be reduced the polysulfide ions and dissolved into electrolyze in the discharge process and therefore causes the loss of active materials. In this review, the charge-discharge mechanism and two capacity fading reasons of Li-S battery are summarized. One is the dissolution of polysulfide ions, which is the so called "redox shuttle" between the sulfur cathode and Li anode. The other is the formation of insoluble lithium sulfide( Li2S) and lithium disulfide( Li2S2) which can cause the sluggish electrochemical reaction during charge and discharge processes. After that, we introduce some recent progress of novel sulfur composites as cathode materials for lithium sulfur battery. These composites can be divided into three categories( such as sulfur/carbon, sulfur/polymer and sulfur/oxide composite materials) and are discussed. In the end, we have concluded the characters of those sulfur composites, and analyzed the prospect of Li-S battery in the future.

The surface structure and crystal form of the composites obtained were characterized and compared by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that sulfur was partially coated by graphene. The graphene folds provided more nano-pores and electron transport channels for sulfur. From TGA results, the sulfur contents of the sulfur/graphene composites measured were about 42.32 wt%, 54.94 wt%, and 65.23 wt%. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that sulfur/graphene composite (x= 54.94 wt%) cathode exhibited better capacity retention (40.13%) compared with the pure cathode (20.46%), where an initial discharge capacity was up to 1 500 mAh.g(-1) and it remained about 600 mAh.g(-1) after 30 cycles. Furthermore, the electrochemical reaction mechanism and the state of reaction interface for Li/S battery were analyzed by cyclic voltammogram and AC-impedance spectra. The results indicated that the sulfur/graphene composite with a sulfur content of 54.94 wt%, based on a two-step synthesis, contributed to improving electrochemical properties of lithium/sulfur battery	[Li Jingyin; Li Na; Li Changjia] Hebei Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Shijiazhuang 050018, Peoples R China; [Guo Yufeng] Hebei Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Shijiazhuang 050018, Peoples R China		Li, JY (corresponding author), Hebei Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Sci, Shijiazhuang 050018, Peoples R China.	linacj2009@163.com			Science and Technology Support Program of Hebei [11215114D]	Science and Technology Support Program of Hebei	Funded partly by the Science and Technology Support Program of Hebei (No. 11215114D)		17	6	6	3	72	JOURNAL WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY	WUHAN	WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA	1000-2413	1993-0437		J WUHAN UNIV TECHNOL	J.

Graphene is coated on one side of polypropylene (PP) separator, which functions as a conductive layer and an electrolyte reservoir that allows for rapid electron and ion transport. Then Al2O3 particles are coated on the other side to further enhance thermal stability and safety of the graphene coated polypropylene (GCP) separator, which are touched with lithium metal anode in the Li-S battery. The GPA separator shows good thermal stability after heating at 157 degrees C for 10 min while both GCP and PP separators showing an obvious shrinkage about 10%. The initial discharge specific capacity of Li-S coin cell with a GPA separator could reach 1067.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C. After 100 discharge/charge cycles, it can still deliver a reversible capacity of as high as 804.4 mAh g(-1) with 75% capacity retention. The pouch cells further confirm that the trilayer design has great promise towards practical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the loading amount of mostly less than 70 wt% induces a limited energy density and the typical fabrication route involving high-temperature and elaborate process also limits the manufacturability of sulfur cathode, both of which hinder the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a scalable, room-temperature, and one-step method is employed for carbon nanotube (CNT)/sulfur composite cathode, in which aligned CNTs served as interconnected conductive scaffolds to accommodate sulfur. When the loading amount of sulfur increased from 50 to 90 wt%, the tap density of CNT/sulfur increased from 0.4 to 1.98 g cm(-3), and the mass/areal/volumetric capacities of the whole electrodes (CNT/sulfur composites and binders) was improved from 500.3 mAh g(-1)/0.298 mAh cm(-2)/200.1 mAh cm(-3) to 563.7 mAh g(-1)/0.893 mAh cm(-2)/1116.0 mAh cm(-3), respectively. The rise of sulfur content in the composite cathode renders a dramatic increase of the energy density of lithium-sulfur cells. The ultra-high loading amount of sulfur is attributed to the open, ordered, straight pore structure of aligned CNT scaffolds for the uniform distribution of fine sulfur particles. The robust sp2 carbon frameworks served as rapid pathways for electron transfer, and the large aspect ratio, good alignment, ordered packing of individual CNT in small bundles offer a low conductive percolation threshold. Consequently, the sulfur with a high loading content was efficiently utilized for a lithium-sulfur cell with a much improved energy density. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This double solvent approach is facile, low cost, and effective in preparing graphene-sulfur composites for large-scale production. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping were used to verify the structure and composition of the G/S composites. The graphene-coating layers not only provide a conductive carbon matrix surrounding the sulfur particles but also prevent the soluble polysulfide intermediates dissolving into the electrolyte. The sizes of sulfur particles can be controlled by adjusting the ratios of double solvent (CS2/alcohol) and may further affect the electrochemical behavior. When used as cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries, the G/S-200 composite with the smallest sulfur particle size shows an initial discharge capacity of 1068.5 mAh g(-1) and retains 729.5 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C. This novel double solvent method is a promising approach to obtain other carbon sulfur composites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the practical performances of Li-S batteries are severely limited by the sulfur cathode regarding its low conductivity, huge volume change, and the polysulfide shuttle effect. The first two issues have been well addressed by introducing mesoporous carbon hosts to the sulfur cathode. Unfortunately, the nonpolar nature of carbon materials renders poor affinity to polar polysulfides, leaving the shuttling issue unaddressed. In this contribution, atomic cobalt is implanted within the skeleton of mesoporous carbon via a supramolecular self-templating strategy, which simultaneously improves the interaction with polysulfides and maintains the mesoporous structure. Moreover, the atomic cobalt dopants serve as active sites to improve the kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. With the atomic-cobalt-decorated mesoporous carbon host, a high capacity of 1130 mAh g(S)(-1) at 0.5 C and a high stability with a retention of 74.1% after 300 cycles are realized. Implanting atomic metal in mesoporous carbon demonstrates a feasible strategy to endow nanomaterials with targeted functions for Li-S batteries and broad applications.

The unique properties of the MOF-on-rGO compartment combining the polarity and porous features of MOFs with the high conductivity of rGO make it an ideal candidate as a sulfur host in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. A high initial discharge capacity of 1250 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 C (1.0 C=1675 mAh g(-1)) was reached using the MOF-on-rGO based electrode. At the rate of 1.0 C, a high specific capacity of 601 mAh g(-1) was still maintained after 400 discharge-charge cycles, which could be ascribed to the synergistic effect between MOFs and rGO. Both the hierarchical structures of rGO and the polar pore environment of MOF retard the diffusion and migration of soluble polysulfide, contributing to a stable cycling performance. Moreover, the spongy-layered rGO can buffer the volume expansion and contraction changes, thus supplying stable structures for Li-S batteries.

To this context, we synthesized a horizontally aligned lamellar porous graphene/nickel composite (LPG-Ni) as a dense sulfur host material to increase the volumetric capacity of lithium-sulfur batteries while retaining high gravimetric capacity. The nickel decorated on the surface of the porous graphene serves as active sites, effectively adsorbing and catalytically converting polysulfides, thus improving the redox kinetics and reducing shuttle effect. More importantly, the abundant pores on the graphene sheet are considered as a shortcut for lithium-ion diffusion, which accelerates the ion transport through the whole electrode. Owing to the synergistic effect, the as-prepared sulfur cathode exhibits both excellent ionic and electronic conductivity, and has a dense-stacked structure. Thus, the LPG-Ni/S cathode provides high gravimetric and volumetric capacity (718.7 mA h g-(-1)(cathode) and 884.0 mA h cm(cathode)(-3) at 0.1C). Meanwhile, the battery exhibits superior rate capability (369.7 mA h cm(cathode)(-3) at 5C) and cycling performance (1000 cycles, 0.037% decay per cycle at 1C).

Among them, microporous carbon can effectively confine sulfur inside pores, however, it shows low active material utilization due to pore blockage by discharge products. To address this issue, in this work, zeolite-templated carbons (ZTCs) with high surface area and electronic conductivity are used as host material for Li-S battery and their particle size is varied to explore better performances. With decrease of the particle size from 400 to 20 nm, initial sulfur utilization is enhanced from 20.7 to 71.6 %. The smaller ZTC particle delivers a high capacity retention of 94.6 % at 200 cycles. From electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses, it is demonstrated that smaller ZTC particles lead to easier penetration of Li ions inside the pores, resulting in more uniform Li2S deposition on the entire surface of the micropores. Due to its excellent size-tunability and well-defined pore structure, ZTC can be an effective sulfur host for the design of high-performance Li-S batteries.

Enhancement retention of polysulfide species into matrix of cobalt oxyhydroxide anchored on graphene oxide flakes by strong chemical binding of carbon-sulfur is demonstrated. Sulfur incorporated in the sheet-like morphology of CoOOH@GO delivers high initial discharge specific capacity of 1190.85 mAh/g, which raises 260 mAh/g with respect to graphene oxide/sulfur (GO/S) as a cathode material. Furthermore, CoOOH@GO/S maintains the average coulombic efficiency of 96 % after 300 cycles at 1 C rate with capacity retention of about 61 %. Good current rate capability of CoOOH@GO/S cathode reveals that the resulting composite is open platform for electrolyte diffusion and fast ion transportation leading to the improved electrochemical performance of lithium/sulfur batteries.

This paper is the first to report that carbon can induce a phase transition in a sulfur cathode. The stable form of a sulfur crystal at ambient temperature is orthorhombic sulfur. We found that monoclinic sulfur becomes more stable than orthorhombic sulfur if carbon atoms penetrate into the sulfur at elevated temperatures and the carbon density exceeds a threshold of C0.3S8. The high stability of the carbon containing monoclinic sulfur persists during lithiation and is attributed to locally formed linear SC3S chains with marked stability. This study provides a novel perspective on the role of carbon in the sulfur cathode and suggests control of the crystal phase of electrodes by composite elements as a new way of designing efficient electrode materials.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is mainly impeded by the inherent poor electrical conductivity of sulfur, the side shuttle behavior of polysulfides, and the volumetric change of sulfur during cycles. To solve these problems, here we report a unique 3D porous and interconnected hollow carbon nanospheres array (3D-HCNA) as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries. This 3D-HCNA was synthesized through a nanocasting approach with sucrose as carbon precursors and mesoporous silica nanospheres as hard-templates. The silica nanospheres with special nanostructure were obtained by a biphase stratification approach. Owing to its unique architecture, as-prepared 3D-HCNA/S cathode with a high sulfur loading of 76 wt% exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. It showed high initial capacity of 1318 mAh/g at 0.05 C and good rate capability of 760 mAh/g at 1 C. Moreover, excellent cycling performance was also observed with a capacity of 757 mAh/g maintained after 200 cycles at 0.5 C.

Towards highly stable lithium sulfur batteries: Surface functionalization of carbon nanotube scaffolds	CARBON			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Surface modification; Electrostatic repulsion; Zeta potential; Functionalization; Carbon scaffold	CYCLE PERFORMANCE; CATHODE MATERIALS; INTERLAYER; LAYER; CELLS	In order to alleviate the systemic challenges underlying in Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries, the surface of non-polar carbon materials have been widely modified with functional polymeric materials and metal-oxide compounds to chemically interact with polysulfides and thus improve the cycle performance of sulfur cathodes. However, the inherent low conductivity and long-term instability of functional polymers and ceramic materials impede the efficient electrochemical reactions and, in the end, deteriorate the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries. In this study, we demonstrated a facile and effective approach to customize the surface characteristics of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via thermal treatments under different atmospheres (oxygen and hydrogen) and exploit these properties for sulfur reservoirs and interlayer barrier in order to enhance the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries. With the aid of different characteristics of modified CNTs, electrochemical performances of sulfur cathodes were effectively optimized in terms of specific capacity and cycling performance. In addition, when interlayers were coupled with general sulfur cathodes with high sulfur loading mass (2.5 mg cm(-1)), it also showed analogous trends in improving the specific capacity and cycle performance (250 cycles).

The Li-S cell assembled by the sulfur (S) cathode with component from C3N4 grafted coal-derived carbon (PM-CN) possesses a specific capacity of 1269.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C. At 1 C, the initial specific capacity of PM cathode is only 380.0 mA h g(-1), comparable to the PM-CN5 cathode of 681.9 mA h g(-1), and PM-CN10 cathode of 580.7 mA h g(-1), respectively. And, PM-CN 5 cathode presents the capacity retention of 75.9% with a coulomb efficiency (C.E.) of 97.3% after 200 cycles. The MUF-CN cathode gives a specific capacity of 1335.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C, and the capacity retention of 66.7% with a C. E. of 93.6% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. The SG-CN cathode had a specific capacity of 953.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C, and capacity retention of 95.1% with a C. E. of 98.2% after 125 cycles at 1 C. The remarkable improved performances were mainly ascribed to the sustainable materials as S host with micro-meso pore and C3N4 structure providing the strong affinity N sites to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). This work provides an attractive approach for the preparation of sustainable materials by rational design of grafting C3N4 to waste-derived carbons with functions as S cathode materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Ethylenediamine (EDA) was employed as both the reducing agent and the modification component. The morphologies, microstructures, and compositions of S/EDA-RGO composites were characterized by various detection techniques. The data indicated that EDA-RGO used as scaffolds for sulfur cathodes could enhance the electronic conductivity of the composites and strengthen the adsorbability of polysulfides. Meanwhile, the electrochemical properties of both S/EDA-RGO and S/RGO composites that were used as cathodes for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries were investigated. The initial discharge capacity of S/EDA-RGO composites reached 1240 mAh g(-1), with reversible capacity being maintained at 714 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. The improvement in cycling stability of S/EDA-RGO composites was further verified at different current rates. These findings demonstrated that proper surface modification of RGO by EDA reducing agent might improve the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries.

However, a low-cost, efficient and replicable way for mass producing suitable host materials that enable high-performance Li-S batteries is still a huge challenge. To tackle this issue, a rPC-NG composite was fabricated by mixing reduced porous carbon material (rPC) prepared from PAN fiber and N-doped graphene (NG) through a simple and scalable ball milling process. Herein, the rPC and NG immobilize sulfur via strong physical and chemical adsorption and inhibit the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) successfully. Importantly, such composite possesses a layered porous structure which can contribute to a high loading of sulfur, leading to the excellent conductivity, outstanding utilization rate and stability of adsorbed sulfur. The resultant rPC-NG/S cathode exhibits a stable cycling performance (503 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 500 cycles and 770 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 200 cycles) and high rate performance (540 mAh g(-1) at 2 C).

Nevertheless, the poor conductivity of sulfur and fast capacity decay of the sulfur-based electrodes restrict its practical applications. Here, we report a facile and simple titration method to synthesize nano-sulfur@liquid-phase exfoliated graphene (Nano-S@LEGr) composites by in situ growth of nanostructural sulfur on the LEGr surface. The as-prepared Nano-S@LEGr with tunable sulfur morphologies exhibited excellent electrochemical performance as the cathode material for Li-S batteries. In particular, the spherical Nano-S@LEGr composites with 68 wt% sulfur displayed a reversible capacity of 552.8 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.5C. Even at a high current density of 1C, a discharge capacity of 532.8 mAh g(-1) could be delivered. Compared to rod-like Nano-S@LEGr and the graphene oxide derived cathode, the as-prepared spherical Nano-S@LEGr showed higher specific capacity, superior cycling stability and rate capability.

However, complex and time-consuming preparation methods limit their practical applications. Therefore, we report the fabrication of titanium nitride/nitrogen-doped graphene (TiN/NG) nanocomposite as separator modifying material via a one-step solid state reaction. This unique structure of TiN/NG, in which ultrafine TiN nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed on the nitrogen-doped graphene skeleton, is favorable for the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides. As a result, the lithium-sulfur batteries with TiN/NG modified separator exhibit the excellent initial discharge capacity (1501 mAh/g at 0.1C) and long-term cycling stability (718 mAh/g at 1C, after 300 cycles).

The mesoporous carbon acts as sulfur host and suppresses the diffusion of polysulfide, while the CNT network anchors the sulfur-absorbed mesoporous carbon particles, providing pathways for rapid electron transport, alleviating polysulfide migration and enabling a high flexibility. The resulting lithium-sulfur battery delivers a high capacity of 1226mAhg(-1) and achieves a capacity retention of 75% after 100 cycles at 0.1C. Moreover, a high capacity of nearly 900mAhg(-1) is obtained for 20mgcm(-2), which is the highest sulfur load to the best of our knowledge. More importantly, the aligned and laminated hybrid cathode endows the battery with high flexibility and its electrochemical performances are well maintained under bending and after being folded for 500 times.

However, one of the challenges remains in the "shuttle effects" of polysulfides, which hinders the practical application of Li-S. To address the above issue, herein, we propose an innovative design strategy of in-situ co-doped nanoporous carbon (ICPC) derived from silkworm excrement to achieve the strong chemical bonding and strict physical confinement of sulfur. As a result, the migration of polysulfides might be suppressed by the synergistic effects of physical and chemical interactions, which is helpful for the significant improvement of electrochemical performance. After 100 stable cyclic discharge-charge tests at the current density of 0.2 C, the reversible capacity of the as obtained ICPC-S composite cathode still maintains around 500 mAh g(-1), corresponding to 67% capacity retention. More importantly, high Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% can be realized, suggesting the greatly avoided "shuttle effects". Such a novel design of in-situ co-doped nanoporous carbon opens up new possibilities for high performance lithium sulfur batteries.

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the effects of the nanoporosity of various porous conductive carbon substrates (e.g., nonporous, microporous, micro/mesoporous, and macroporous carbons) on the electrochemical characteristics and cell performances of the resulting high-loading carbon-sulfur composite cathodes. The comparison analysis of this work demonstrates the importance of having high microporosity in the sulfur cathode substrate. The high-loading microporous carbon-sulfur cathode attains a high sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2) and sulfur content of 80 wt% at a low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio of 10 mu L mg(-1). The lithium-sulfur cell with the microporous carbon-sulfur cathode demonstrates excellent electrochemical performances, attaining a high discharge capacity approaching 1100 mA center dot h g(-1), a high-capacity retention of 75% after 100 cycles, and superior high-rate capability of C/20-C/3 with excellent reversibility.

However, the utilization of sulfur is seriously reduced by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and the low conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide (Li2S). Herein, we introduced bimetalorganic frameworks (Co/Zn-ZIF) derived cobalt and nitrogen-doped carbons (Co/N-C) into Li-S batteries through host design and separator modification. The Co/N-C in Li-S batteries effectively limits the shuttle effect through simultaneously serving as polysulfide traps and chemical catalyst. As a result, the Li-S batteries deliver a high reversible capacity of 1614.5 mAh/g and superior long-term cycling stability with a negligible capacity decay of only 0.04% per cycle after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, they have a high area capacity of 5.5 mAh/cm(2). (C) 2020 Chinese Chemical Society and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We synthesized a series of nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons (CPANs) via in situ polymerization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) in SBA-15 template followed by carbonization at different temperatures. Carbonization results in the formation of ladder structure which enhances the stability of the matrix. In this study, CPAN-800, carbon matrix synthesized by the carbonization at 800 degrees C, was found to possess many desirable properties such as high specific surface area and pore volume, moderate nitrogen content, and highly ordered mesoporous structure. Therefore, it was used to prepare S/CPAN-800 composite as cathode material in lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The S/CPAN-800 composite was proved to be an excellent material for Li-S cells which delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 1585 mAh g(-1) and enhanced capacity retention of 862 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 degrees C after 100 cycles.

However, due to the poor conductivity of the active material, considerable weight of the electrode is occupied by the conductive additives. Here we report a graphene-wrapped sulfur nanospheres composite (S-nanosphere@G) with sulfur content up to 91 wt% as the high energy density cathode material for Li-S battery. The sulfur nanospheres with diameter of 400-500 nm are synthesized through a solution-based approach with the existence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Then the sulfur nanospheres are uniformly wrapped by conductive graphene sheets through the electrostatic interaction between graphene oxide and PVP, followed by reducing of graphene oxide with hydrazine. The design of graphene wrapped sulfur nanoarchitecture provides flexible conductive graphene coating with void space to accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur and to minimize polysulfide dissolution. As a result, the S-nanosphere@G nanocomposite with 91 wt% sulfur shows a reversible initial capacity of 970 mA h g(-1) and an average columbic efficiency >96% over 100 cycles at a rate of 0.2 C.

Nevertheless, the degradation of lithium anode in Li-S battery is the crucial obstacle for practical application. In this work, a porous carbon paper obtained from corn stalks via simple treating procedures is used as interlayer to stabilize the surface morphology of Li anode in the environment of Li-S battery. A smooth surface morphology of Li is obtained during cycling by introducing the porous carbon paper into Li-S battery. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode is partially enhanced by alleviating the loss of soluble intermediates (polysulfides) into the electrolyte, as well as the side reaction of polysulfides with metallic lithium. The Li-S battery assembled with the interlayer exhibits a large capacity and excellent capacity retention. Therefore, the porous carbon paper as interlayer plays a bifunctional role in stabilizing the Li anode and enhancing the electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode for constructing a stable Li-S battery.

One of our authors constructed a novel Li2S@graphene cathode material that exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance (Nat. Energy 2017, 2, 17090) in Li-S batteries, but the underlying mechanism remains unexplored. Herein we performed systematical theoretical study to address the mechanisms. First principle calculation shows that the defects on graphene directly contributes to the superior electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery in three aspects. First, defects on graphene facilitate the binding of Li2S, thus lowering the decomposition barrier of Li2S during the first charge cycle, leading to the lowered activation voltage in experiment. Second, the followed Li ion diffusion is promoted by defects. Third, in the following discharge/charge cycles S-doped graphene is formed, which improves the conversion of S 8 to Li2S during discharge process as well as inhibits the "shuttle effect ". Moreover, if vacancy defects remain on graphene, the above two advantages still hold, supporting the high rate performance observed in experiment. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the improved electrochemical performance of Li2S@graphene as cathode in Li-S battery from the perspective of defects on graphene, and helps the rational design of potential 2D materials as cathode for practical Li-S batteries.

To address the issues of single functional, mechanical crushing and peeling of the conventional rigid LiF SEI, a unique functional-selected rigid-flexible-coupled LiF-intercalated-graphene (LiF-GN) SEI as anodic protection is constructed, which is verified by in-operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. Owing to the synergistic effect of the LiF and graphene layer, this intercalated functional selected SEI architecture exhibits a dramatic elastic modulus (rigid-flexible coupling with a shallow Young's modulus (similar to 430 MPa) and a tremendous Young's modulus of similar to 20 GPa), high mechanical strength, and can be repulsive to polysulfides, accompanied unprecedented trafficability of Li ions. Consequently, the forceful exclusion of polysulfides from the LiF-GN SEI, as confirmed by means of in-situ UV/vis analysis, Li-S nucleation tests, and visual permeation experiments, is of profound significance for the effective protection of Li anodes and enables Li-S batteries to achieve remarkable electrochemical performance (ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.022% during 300 cycles at 1 C and high discharge capacity of 1092 mAh/g at 0.5 C).

To address these issues, we report here nickel nanoparticles filled in vertically grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on graphene sheets (graphene-CNT-nickel composite (Gr-CNT-Ni)) that are coated onto a polypropylene separator as a polysulfide trap for the construction of high-loading sulfur cathodes. The hierarchical porous framework of Gr-CNT physically entraps and immobilizes the active material sulfur, while the strong chemical interaction with Ni nanoparticles in Gr-CNT-Ni inhibits polysulfide diffusion. The covalently interconnected electron conduction channels and carbon shell-confined metal active sites provide feasible paths for the continual regeneration of active material during the charge-discharge process. Benefitting from these novel morphological and structural features, the Li-S cell with the Gr-CNT-Ni as a polysulfide trap demonstrates high specific capacity and good cycle life. This work provides new avenues for synergistically combining the advantages of hierarchical porous carbon architectures and metal active sites for the development of high-performance cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Herein, a one-step deposition method was designed to prepare separators with carbon soot (CS) loading simply and rapidly. The CS-loaded separators could provide a conductive network and enhance electrolyte wettability, and also make the electrochemical redox reactions faster. As a result, the battery could reach an improved specific capacity of 901.3 and 754.1 mAh/g at 0.2C and 1C with low carbon loading and remain 522.1 and 536.8 mAh/g after 100 cycles, respectively, with a capacity retention of 57.9% and 71.2%.

Using sulfur/carbon composites as the cathode materials has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to optimize sulfur utilization and enhance cycle stability as well. In this work, hollow-in-hollow carbon spheres with hollow foam-like cores (HCSF@C) are prepared to improve both capability and cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries. With high surface area and large pore volumes, the loading of sulfur in HCSF@C reaches up to 70 wt.%. In the resulting S/HCSF@C composites, the outer carbon shell serves as an effective protection layer to trap the soluble polysulfide intermediates derived from the inner component. Consequently, the S/HCSF@C cathode retains a high capacity of 780 mAh/g after 300 cycles at a high charge/discharge rate of 1 A/g.

However, the commercialization of Li-S battery was hindered by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide and the slow reaction kinetics of sulfur. In this study, MIL-101(Cr) with graphene oxide was composited together through spray-drying. Then, a graphene microsphere composite consisted of three-dimensional conductive network decorated with Cr-Ni-based nanodots (Cr-Ni-NDs) was developed through a facile heat treatment. The microsphere composite was denoted as Cr-Ni-NDs@G, which offers a porous structure and high surface area to increase the accommodation and uniform distribution of sulfur in the cathode. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional conductive network embedded by Cr and Ni nanoparticle not only improved the transportation of electrons, but also act as the active site strengthening the adsorption of lithium polysulfide, promoting the catalytic transformation of lithium polysulfide to Li2S. Due to these complementary features, the S/Cr-Ni-NDs@G cathode exhibited a high initial specific capacity (1222.3 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2C) and good rate performance (706 mAh.g(-1) at 3.0C). In addition, after 500cycles at 1.0C, the faded rate of per cycle of the Li-S battery is only 0.059%. The result demonstrated that S/Cr-Ni-NDs@G composite can be a promising energy storage material in the development of Li-S batteries.

However, they suffer from rapid capacity fading and poor cyclic stability, which is far from the practical application. Developing an effective sulfur impregnation method is of great importance, especially meeting the demand for large-scale commercial application. In this work, we have prepared reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via microwave method as the host for high-performance sulfur cathode and three methods (melt-diffusion method, chemical precipitation method and chemical precipitation-melt diffusion method) have been explored to synthesize rGO@S composites for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Method: Graphene oxides (GO) were prepared from natural graphite by modified Hummer's method. Then reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by microwave method. rGO@S composites were prepared by melt-diffusion method, chemical precipitation method and chemical pre- cipitation-melt diffusion method. The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were analyzed to obtained the overall performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Result: The chemical precipitation-melt diffusion method is an effective strategy to achieve appropriate sulfur encapsulation, where smaller sulfur is impregnated uniformly into abundant pores of rGO matrix. As a result, the CM-rGO@S composite delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1108.8 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 C, and maintains a stable capacity of 751.3 mAh g(-1) after 80 cycles. Furthermore, the CM-rGO@S composite exhibits enhanced cyclic stability and excellent rate capability, delivering a capacity of 598.4 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at a high current density of 0.5 C with a capacity retention of 65.8%. Conclusion: In summary, the rGO@S composite prepared by chemical precipitation-melt diffusion method shows outstanding electrochemical performance, such as superior cycle stability and excellent rate capability. It demonstrated that the chemical precipitation-melt diffusion method is an effective strategy to achieve appropriate sulfur encapsulation, where smaller sulfur is impregnated uniformly into abundant pores of rGO matrix. We believe that this attempt can give insights on the other cathode preparation for achieving high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

However the low conductivity of elemental sulfur and the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides lead to low rate performance and poor cyclability, which seriously hamper the rapid development of Li-S batteries. Herein, we report the encapsulation of sulfur into hierarchical porous carbon derived from soybean hulls. The as-prepared hierarchical carbon materials have a high specific surface area of 1232 m(2) g(-1) and a large total pore volume of 0.5394 cm(3) g(-1), resulting in the 63.7 wt% loading of sulfur. When applied as cathode hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries, a good electro-chemical performance has been achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, Li-S batteries still face a challenge of unsatisfied cycle life due to the so-called "shuttle effect". Here, a 3D light-weight and porous C3N4 nanosheets@reduced graphene oxide (PCN@rGO) network is prepared to overcome the barrier. The 3D PCN@rGO network can not only firmly anchor polysulfides by strong chemical adsorption, but also offer fast electron and mass transfer paths to enhance kinetics of redox reactions. Meanwhile, the 3D network can hinder aggregation of C3N4 nanosheets or rGO nanosheets to remain a high surface area. As a result, the PCN@rGO cathode delivers high reversible capacities of 1205, 1150, 986, 800, 685, and 483 mAh g(-1) at the rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5C, respectively, and the cathode still delivers a specific capacity of 680 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C after 800 cycles, demonstrating a very low capacity decay of 0.048% per cycle. The exploration of this light-weight polar C3N4 as a sulfur host provides a promising choice to achieve high energy density and long cycle life Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs) decorated with ultrafine TiO2 nanoparticles (CNF-T) were prepared and used as a multifunctional interlayer to suppress the volume expansion and shuttle effect of Li-S battery. With this strategy, the CNF network with abundant space and superior conductivity can accommodate and recycle the dissolved polysulfides for the bare sulfur cathode. Meanwhile, the ultrafine TiO2 nanoparticles on CNFs work as anchoring points to capture the polysulfides with the strong interaction, making the battery perform with remarkable and stable electrochemical properties. As a result, the Li-S battery with the CNF-T interlayer delivers an initial reversible capacity of 935 mA h g(-1) at 1 C with a capacity retention of 74.2% after 500 cycles. It is believed that this simple, low-cost and scalable method will definitely bring a novel perspective on the practical utilization of Li-S batteries.

By manipulating its structure thereby creating more defects, N-CNTs presents better dispersion of sulfur particles on N-CNTs and higher electrical conductivity compared with their non-doped counterpart, which explain the reason why N-CNTs/S composite shows improved performance. The specific discharge capacity was maintained at 625 mAh g(-1) and 513 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and 0.5 C, respectively, which was about 2 times as that of CNTs.

However, the practical performance of the sulfur cathode is plagued by fast capacity decay and poor cycle life, both of which can be attributed to the intrinsic dissolution/shuttling of lithium polysulfides. Here, a new built-in magnetic field-enhanced polysulfide trapping mechanism is discovered by introducing ferromagnetic iron/iron carbide (Fe/Fe3C) nanoparticles with a graphene shell (Fe/Fe3C/graphene) onto a flexible activated cotton textile (ACT) fiber to prepare the ACT@Fe/Fe3C/graphene sulfur host. The novel trapping mechanism is demonstrated by significant differences in the diffusion behavior of polysulfides in a custom-designed liquid cell compared to a pure ACT/S cathode. Furthermore, a cell assembled using the ACT@Fe/Fe3C/S cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of approximate to 764 mAh g(-1), excellent rate performance, and a remarkably long lifespan of 600 cycles using ACT@Fe/Fe3C/S (whereas only 100 cycles can be achieved using pure ACT/S). The new magnetic field-enhanced trapping mechanism provides not only novel insight but unveils new possibilities for mitigating the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides thereby promoting the practical applications of Li-S batteries.

Herein, orientation growth of IT MoS2 nanosheets on biomass carbon (1T MoS2@C) are successfully fabricated by solvothermal approach and then utilized as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries. The structure of IT MoS2@C composites was examined by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis etc. Results reveal that the 1T MoS2@C has a well-defined porous structure with high surface area (155.3 m(2) g(-1)). Electrochemical measurements reveal that the 1T MoS2@C/S cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1090.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a high-capacity retention of 735.2 mAh g(-1) with capacity fade of 0.059% per cycle over 300 cycles at 1 C. This facile and cost-effective strategy for synthesising 1T MoS2@C materials provide a new avenue for the development of low-cost Li-S batteries.

However, lithium sulfur battery still suffers from a rapid capacity fading and poor rate performance, which are mainly related to the shuttle effect of polysulfides during cycling and the insulating nature of sulfur as well as the reduced product of Li2S or Li2S2. Here, we proposed an iodine-incorporated carbon/sulfur electrode to improve the rate performance of Li-S batteries. The resultant composite electrode exhibits good high-rate charge-discharge capability with a high discharge capacity of 479 mAh/g at 3C after 100 cycles. The excellent rate capability is mainly correlated to the iodine-doped carbon host with improved electronic conductivity, formation of lithium iodide (LiI) served as solid-state electrolyte in electrode during the first discharge process and the dissolution of iodine species into the electrolyte as additive for improving the ionic conductivity. This work offers an innovative, effective and facile method to ameliorate the electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries is greatly affected owing to several issues. In this paper, we designed a polyaniline@spherical ordered mesoporous carbon/sulfur nanocomposite (PANI@S-OMC/S), and S-OMC/S was wrapped by PANI via in-situ polymerization. The inherently conducting nature of PANI increased conductivity of PANI@S-OMC/S electrode to improve the free transfer of electrons, and PANI shell also provided a barrier between the lithium polysulfides and electrolyte to further prevent the occurrence of the "shuttle effect". Moreover, mesoporous pores are wonderful hosts to contain sulfur to trap the long-chain lithium polysulfides and prevent them from dissolving in electrolyte. A high initial discharge capacity of 1626 mAh/g was achieved for the PANI S-OMC/S electrode in first cycle at 0.1 C, and the composite maintains 1338 mAh/g after 100 cycles while the coulombic efficiency still remains-98%.

A Hierarchical Three-Dimensional Porous Laser-Scribed Graphene Film for Suppressing Polysulfide Shuttling in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						laser-scribed graphene; graphene; lithium-sulfur battery; interlayer; high capacity; polysulfide shuttling	INTERLAYER; CARBON; MECHANISM	The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is a promising next-generation rechargeable battery with high energy density. Given the outstanding capacities of sulfur (1675 mAh g(-1)) and lithium metal (3861 mAh g(-1)), Li-S battery theoretically delivers an ultrahigh energy density of 2567 Wh kg(-1). However, this energy density cannot be realized due to several factors, particularly the shuttling of polysulfide intermediates between the cathode and anode, which causes serious degradation of capacity and cycling stability of a Li-S battery. In this work, a simple and scalable route was employed to construct a freestanding laser-scribed graphene (LSG) interlayer that effectively suppresses the polysulfide shuttling in Li-S batteries. Thus, a high specific capacity (1160 mAh g(-1)) with excellent cycling stability (80.4% capacity retention after 100 cycles) has been achieved due to the unique structure of hierarchical three-dimensional pores in the freestanding LSG.

The microstructure, morphology, and specific surface areas of the resultant samples have been systematically characterized. The results indicate that most of sulfur is well dispersed over the core area of HPCs after the impregnation of sulfur. Meanwhile, the shell of HPCs with void pores is serving as a retard against the dissolution of lithium polysulfides. This structure can enhance the transport of electron and lithium ions as well as alleviate the stress caused by volume change during the charge-discharge process. The as-prepared HPC-sulfur (HPC-S) composite with 65.3 wt% sulfur delivers a high specific capacity of 1397.9 mAhg(-1) at a current density of 335 mAg(-1) (0.2 C) as a cathode material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, and the discharge capacity of the electrode could still reach 753.2 mAhg(-1) at 6700 mAg(-1) (4C). Moreover, the composite electrode exhibited an excellent cycling capacity of 830.5 mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles.

By simple mixing of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), sulfur powder, and capping agents in water/tetrahydrofuran, micrometer bipyramidal sulfur particles enclosed with MWCNTs are synthesized. The MWCNTs spontaneously form a 3D conducting network inside and outside the sulfur particle. Along the edge of MWCNT framework, a sulfur particle-free region is present, which comprises approximate to 35 vol% based on the total volume. These sulfur-MWCNT bipyramidal particles are mixed with conductive carbon additive to prepare binder-free cathode for Li-S cells. The Li-S cells deliver a specific discharge capacity of approximate to 1600 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C on the first cycle. In particular, these Li-S cells show high rate stability and Coulombic efficiency with deep discharge and charge (1.0-3.0 V vs Li/Li+). This resultant performance can arise from 1) homogeneous distribution of the conducting MWCNT framework and the carbon additive coating layer on the sulfur particle, which allow rapid Li+ ion/electrolyte diffusion and mitigation of polysulfide shuttle, respectively, and 2) the sulfur-free buffer space accommodating volume expansion. It is expected that this new cathode design with the simple synthetic process can reduce the number of preparation steps, thus allowing the construction of a low-cost Li-S battery.

However, the practical use of Li-S batteries is hindered mainly due to the serious polysulfide shuttling phenomenon. Therefore, the best way to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery is controlling the shuttling effect caused by the dissolution of polysulfide in the electrolyte. Herein, three different carbon felts were prepared by using vapor growth carbon fiber (VGCF), activated carbon (AC) and super P (SP), respectively, and were used as interlayer between cathode and separator to trap intermediates polysulfides. As a result, the Li-S battery with VGCF interlayer showed high specific initial discharge capacity of 1262 mAh g(-1) and superior cycling performance (836 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycle) at 0.1C.

And it maintains much higher Coulombic efficiency and capacity retention after 200 cycles than those of the sulfur/carbon binary electrode. Moreover, rate capability of the ternary electrode is enhanced greatly. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the addition of carbon fiber, which provides convenient paths for rapid transfer of electrons during the redox reaction of sulfur.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is very promising for the development of next-generation high-energy battery due to its ultra-high theoretical capacity. However, the development of flexible Li-S battery has been plagued by its fast capacity decay and lack of suitable flexible substrates. Herein, a conductive activated cotton textile (ACT) with porous tubular structure was first derived from natural cotton textile to load sulfur, which was further wrapped with partially reduced graphene oxide (ACT/S-rGO) to immobilize lithium polysulfides. Meanwhile, the partially reduced graphene oxide nanosheets could be served as a conductive coating, which further mitigated the poor conductivity of sulfur and enabled fast electron transportation along ACT fibers. Furthermore, a KOH-activated ACT with micropore size distribution was inserted between cathode and separator to mitigate the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides. Finally, the assembled ACT/S-rGO cathode with porous ACT interlayer exhibited an exceptional rate capability and durable cyclic performance (with a well-retained capacity of similar to 1016 mAh g(-1) even after 200 cycles). A flexible Li-S cell with ACT/S-rGO as a cathode was also assembled to demonstrate its superior potential as flexible power sources for future wearable electronic devices. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Particles of different diameters (ranging from 100 nm to 10 mu m), geometries, and compositions (sulfur, silicon, and carbon) are successfully wrapped up by GO, by engineering the ionic strength in solutions. Importantly, our method does not involve any chemical reaction between GO and the wrapped particles, and therefore, it can be extended to vast kinds of functional particles. The applications of sulfur/GO core-shell particles as Li-S battery cathode materials are further investigated, and the results show that sulfur/GO exhibit significant improvements over bare sulfur particles without coating. Galvanic charge-discharge test using GO/sulfur particles shows a specific capacity of 800 mAh/g is retained after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g current rate if only the mass of sulfur is taken into calculation, and 400 mAh/g if the total mass of sulfur/GO is considered. Most importantly, the capacity decay over 1000 cycles is less than 0.02% per cycle. The coating method developed in this study is facile, robust, and versatile and is expected to have wide range of applications in improving the properties of particle materials.

However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur, dissolution of polysulfides, and structural collapse of electrode limit its practical application. Here an ultrathin honeycomb-like porous carbon derived from loofah sponge and doped with nitrogen (PCLSN) is prepared as a stable host for sulfur nanoparticles. Attributed to the integrated honeycomb structure, hierarchical porosity, ultrathin honeycomb walls, and synergistic effects between physical and chemical adsorption of polysulfides, the developed PCLSN@S cathode achieves a high initial specific capacity of 1379 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, outstanding cyclability with a small capacity decay rate of 0.044% per cycle over 970 cycles at 2 C, excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 664 mA h g(-1) at 3 C, and high sulfur content of PCLSNRS up to 76.1%.

Herein, a freestanding hollow carbon fiber (HCF) derived from waste cotton tissues was designed as an interlayer for Li-S batteries by one-step carbonization at different temperatures. The inherently interwoven fibers and exceptional hollow structure of the carbon interlayers can effectively accelerate the reaction kinetics and restrain the "Shuttling Effect." Moreover, carbon interlayer can also act as an upper current collector to reutilize the active material, and further enhance the reversible capacities. In this study, the HCF-800 carbon fiber interlayer was fabricated by carbonization at 800 degrees C, which can endow the HCF interlayer with many profitable properties such as rich pore structures, excellent flexibility, and exceptional hollow tube structure. Therefore, the S/super-P with HCF-800 cell was shown the excellent cycling stability with 733 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C after 100 cycles. Even under a high sulfur loading of 2.23 mg cm(-2), the cell also maintained a high capacity of 502 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles.

However, low active material utilization and poor cycle life limit their practical applications. Here, we report a strategy to obtain high capacity with long cycle life and rapid charge rate by introducing a carbon coating on the separator. Excellent cycling performance with a high capacity 956 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles and outstanding high-rate response up to 4 C are achieved, which are among the best reports so far. High electrochemical performance can be obtained even at a high sulfur loading of 3.37 mg cm(-2). Such improved results could be ascribed to the conductive carbon coating, which not only reduces the cell resistance but blocks the diffusion of soluble polysulfides avoiding shuttle effect during cycling. This study demonstrates a feasible, low cost and scalable approach to address the long-term cycling challenge for lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the commercialized application of Li-S batteries is still restricted by several problems, including the dissolution of polysulfides in electrolyte and low conductivity of sulfur. Herein, a three-dimensional conductive cross-linked all-carbon network as a host matrix of sulfur is rationally designed and constructed using biomass silkworm faeces derived porous carbon (SFPC), reduction graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via a one-pot heat treatment approach. Meanwhile, it is found that the amounts of rGO and CNTs added have a great influence on the electrochemical properties of electrode. The optimum contents of CNTs and GO were explored, which are both 5% (the as-prepared material denoted as 55-PGC@SFPC). The obtained 55-PGC@SFPC/S with high content sulfur of 70% as a cathode of Li-S batteries exhibits the initial discharge capacity of 1354 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, excellent rate capacity of 478 mAh g(-1) at 3 C, admirable long-term cycling stability with a high reversible capacity of 414 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles and low capacity decay rate of 0.035% per cycle. The designed three-dimensional network structure could lead to a quick diffusion of Li+/e(-) and a good impeding effect for polysulfides dissolution, which is beneficial for developing the advanced energy storage device of Li-S batteries.

However, the shuttle of intermediate polysulfides is still one of the unresolved obstacles for their practical application. In this work, the potential of SnS2 monolayer as polysulfides anchoring material for suppressing the "shuttle effect" were investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that SnS2 monolayer can immobilize polysulfides with moderate binding strength and preserve their structural integrity well. The low diffusion barriers of long-chain polysulfides on SnS2 surface suggest the improved electrode reaction efficiency. Furthermore, SnS2/graphene heterostructure with improved electrical conductivity was selected to analyze the applicability, which also shows outstanding anchoring performance and good diffusion property for polysulfides. Combined with the small reduction free energies of S8 to Li2S and low decomposition barriers of Li2S during the discharge/charge process, we can conclude that SnS2-based composites are promising anchoring materials for advanced Li-S batteries.

CoSnO3 provides plentiful polar active sites, which restrains the dissolution of polysulfides with chemical interaction. Carbon nanofibers not only provide more ion transport channels, but also increase physical adsorption, provide active sites, and improve the conductivity of the electrode material. As a result, CoSnO3@CNFs can carry about 60 % sulfur as guest. Evaluated as cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, CoSnO3@CNFs/S displayed an initial discharge capacity of 554.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, and retained 300.0 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. The simple synthesis method, high sulfur loading capacity and long cycle life make CoSnO3@CNFs extremely attractive for practical applications.

Originated from the slow redox kinetics of polysulfide intermediates, the flood of polysulfides in the batteries during cycling induced low sulfur utilization, severe polarization, low energy efficiency, deteriorated polysulfide shuttle, and short cycling life. Herein, sulfiphilic cobalt disulfide (CoS2) was incorporated into carbon/sulfur cathodes, introducing strong interaction between lithium polysulfides and CoS2 under working conditions. The interfaces between CoS2 and electrolyte served as strong adsorption and activation sites for polar polysulfides and therefore accelerated redox reactions of polysulfides. The high polysulfide reactivity not only guaranteed effective polarization mitigation and promoted energy efficiency by 10% but also promised high discharge capacity and stable cycling performance during 2000 cycles. A slow capacity decay rate of 0.034%/cycle at 2.0 C and a high initial capacity of 1368 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C were achieved. Since the propelling redox reaction is not limited to Li-S system, we foresee the reported strategy herein can be applied in other high-power devices through the systems with controllable redox reactions.

The strong anchoring of intermediates is widely accepted to retard the shuttle of polysulfides in a working battery. However, the understanding of the intrinsic chemistry is still deficient. Inspired by the concept of hydrogen bond, herein we focus on the Li bond chemistry in Li-S batteries through sophisticated quantum chemical calculations, in combination with Li-7 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Identified as Li bond, the strong dipole-dipole interaction between Li polysulfides and Li-S cathode materials originates from the electron-rich donors (e.g., pyridinic nitrogen (pN)), and is enhanced by the inductive and conjugative effect of scaffold materials with pi-electrons (e.g., graphene). The chemical shift of Li polysulfides in Li-7 NMR spectroscopy, being both theoretically predicted and experimentally verified, is suggested to serve as a quantitative descriptor of Li bond strength. These theoretical insights were further proved by actual electrochemical tests. This work highlights the importance of Li bond chemistry in Li-S cell and provides a deep comprehension, which is helpful to the cathode materials rational design and practical applications of Li-S batteries.

However, for the large-scale applications it is still a major challenge to produce Li-S batteries with remarkable capacity and long stability. Herein, a graphitized carbon/sulfur composites cathode was fabricated with an ultrahigh sulfur percentage of 90 wt%, which could deliver a high initial overall discharge capacity of 1070 mAh g(-1) ((S-C)) and a discharge capacity of 804 mAh g-1 ((S-C)) after 50 cycles. Even with a sulfur loading as high as 4 mg cm(-2), the graphitized C/S composites can still deliver a high initial overall discharge capacity of 908 mAh g-1 ((S-C)) and a discharge capacity of 739 mAh g-1 ((S-C)) after 100 cycles. The graphitized carbon with high electrical conductivity, adjustable pore size, pore volume and surface area was synthesized by using commercialized nano-CaCO3 as template and graphitization catalyst. Density functional theory calculation revealed the graphitized structure exhibited stronger adhesion strength with polysulfide. Moreover, the porosity of graphitized carbon enhances the adsorption between carbon and polysulfide.

However, the inferior cycle stability mainly due to the dissolution of polysulfides seriously restricts its practical application. Herein, a porous N-doped carbon nanofiber/carbon nanotube aggregate is obtained through the chemical oxidation combined with chemical vapor deposition method for lithium-sulfur batteries. The favorable microstructure and configuration exhibit good ability of localizing and retaining dissolved intermediate polysulfides through the in situ growth of carbon nanotube bushes on the carbonized polyaniline (PANI) nanofiber. Moreover, the three-dimensional conductive carbon as a matrix facilitates the electron transfer and reversible electrochemical reaction of active materials during cycling. This advantageous structure exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with high initial discharge capacity of 1018mAhg(-1) and stable capacity of 591mAhg(-1) at 1 C after 500cycles.

Elemental sulfur was composited with as-prepared HPC through a melt diffusion method to form a S/HPC nanocomposite. Structure and morphology characterization revealed a hierarchically sponge-like structure of HPC with high pore volume (0.62 cm(3).g (-1)) and large specific surface area (1261.7 m(2). g(-1) ) When tested in Li/S batteries, the resulting compound demonstrated excellent cycling stability, delivering a second-specific capacity of 1154 mAh.g (-1) as well as presenting 74% retention of value after 100 cycles at 0.1 C.

On one hand, the V2O5/G interlayer can act as a barrier to block polysulfides diffusion and then suppress the troublesome shuttle effect. On the other hand, lithium ions can insert in and extract from V2O5 during discharge/charge processes, and thus contribute extra cathode capacity and large voltage window to the batteries. As expected, the Li-S batteries with a V2O5/G interlayer deliver a large voltage window of 2.0 V (3.6-1.6 V) and a significantly improved electrochemical performance.

The graphene sheet can function as a robust support to anchor NCNTs so that the specific surface area of the composite can be increased and the charge-transfer resistance is reduced. These features, together with the high N-doping level, impart the NCNTs-G/S cathode a high utilization of sulfur, and the polysulfide shuttle effect can be effectively inhibited by both physical confinement and chemical adsorption. Therefore, the NCNTs-G/S cathode shows high reversible capacities of 1484 mA h g(-1) and 985 mA h g(-1 )at the current rate of 0.1 C and 0.5 C, respectively. It also exhibits a good cycling stability; 82% of its initial capacity is retained after 150 cycles at 0.5 C, and a very small capacity decay rate of 0.06% per cycle resulted in 400 cycles at 1 C. Based on the above structural characteristics and battery performance results, the NCNTs-G/S is a promising cathode for a high-performance Li S battery.

Specially, the m-DSHCS with an outer microporous carbon shell and foam-like conductive carbon links is an ideal sulfur host. The foam-like carbon links between the shells and inside the hollow structure can not only provide enough space for sulfur loading and volume expansion, but also facilitate fast electron transfer and Li+ diffusion. Additionally, the outer microporous carbon shell can also serve as an efficient physical barrier to suppress the diffusion of sulfur species derived from inner hollow carbon sphere. When used as cathode material for Li-S batteries, the m-DSHCS/S electrode delivered an outstanding reversible capacities (capacity fading of 0.16% per cycle at 0.2C after 200 cycles and 0.07% per cycle at 1C after 1000 cycles) and superior high-rate capabilities (900 mAh g(-1) at 1C and 800 mAh g(-1) at 2C) than that of graphene wrapped hollow carbon sphere/sulfur (rGO@HCS/S) electrode (100 cycles at 0.2C with 0.54% capacity fading per cycle, 670 mAh g(-1) at 1C and 540 mAh g(-1) at 2C).

The preparation of high-sulfur-content electrodes is currently hindered by poor dispersion of the conductive agents; nonuniformly distributed conductive agents cannot provide sufficient sulfur-loading sites, thereby resulting in aggregation of sulfur/Li2S and severe polarization. To deal with this issue, we prepare CO2 modified carbon nanotube (CNT)-based cathodes for Li-S batteries. CNTs are exposed to CO2 at 900 degrees C, resulting in uniformly distributed negative charges on the external surface of the tubes; the electrostatic repulsion facilitated the dispersion of CNTs. Compared with the previous work on CNTs prepared by air oxidation (denoted as air-CNTs), the dispersions of the CO2-treated CNTs (denoted as CO2-CNTs) are more stable, which allows higher sulfur loading and improves sulfur utilization. A free-standing CO2-CNT&S electrode with a sulfur content of 80 wt% is fabricated through a sonication-assisted method. The excellent dispersion of the CO2-CNT&S network results in little kinetic barriers, low polarization, and fast charge transport at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte. The CO2-CNT&S electrode delivers a lower capacity fading rate and superior rate performance compared with the air-CNT&S electrode. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The NiCo2S4@CNTs presents a unique structure, which possesses thin branches filled with densely packed small leaves where a large number of micropores distribute. In the novel superstructure, carboxylated carbon nanotubes can effectively improve the electronic transportation capacity and conductivity of the cathode material. In lithium-sulfur batteries, bimetal sulfides have a strong adsorption of the polysulfides, effectively suppressing the diffusion of lithium polysulfides. The NiCo2S4@CNTs/S electrode shows a capacity of 788 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 C and 758 mA h g(-1) at 2 C. Even after 1000 cycles at the current density of 0.6 C the capacity only decays by 0.0489% each cycle. It should be notes that most of Coulombic efficiency of the NiCo2S4@CNTs/S electrode is about 99%, regardless of the current density. More importantly, the NiCo2S4@CNTs can exhibit an outstanding capability of absorbing lithium polysulfides, which provides a promising strategy for preparing advanced lithium-sulfur batteries.

The as-designed wrapping of the sulfur-nanoparticles, with wrinkled GO composites, was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Functional separators using two-dimension exfoliation nanosheets could efficiently barrier polysulfides for long-life Li-S batteries. Herein, we fabricate new two-dimensional ZnS(en)0.5 exfoliation nanosheets (ZENs) with microwave-assist exfoliation method, then composite it with graphene (G) to modify Celgard as separators for Li-S batteries. The ZENs were approximate 30-80 nm flakes. The ZENs dispersion is mixed with G powders and filtered on Celgard form the ZENs/G/Celgard separators. The sample sulfur (70 wt %(sulfur)) cathodes with ZENs/G/Celgard separator deliver an initial capacity of 1165.9 mA h g(-1), a substantial capacity of 685.3 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles with capacity retention of 58.8% at 0.1 C, as well as 0.036% of capacity decay per cycle when cycled 1000 times at 0.5 C.

Trapping and anchoring polysulfides are promising approaches for overcoming this issue. In this work, a mechanically robust, electrically conductive hybrid carbon aerogel (HCA) with aligned and interconnected pores was created and investigated as an interlayer for Li-S batteries. The hierarchical cross-linked networks constructed by graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes can act as an "internet" to capture the polysulfide, while the microand nano-pores inside the aerogel can facilitate quick penetration of the electrolyte and rapid transport of lithium ions. As advantages of the unique structure and excellent accommodation of the volume change of the active materials, a high specific capacity of 1,309 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.2 C was achieved for the assembled Li-S battery, coupled with good rate performance and long-term cycling stability (78% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 4 C).

However, their rate capability is not sufficiently high, prompting a great demand for improvement. Herein, a sulfur-based composite electrode is fabricated for the high-rate operation of all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries. The electrode is made of a carbon material having a large number of "interconnected mesopores" with a diameter of 5 nm. The highly mesoporous structure is conducive to electrode reactions and the formation of conduction pathways. Consequently, the rate capability of the composite electrode is drastically improved compared with that of an electrode made of conventional conducting nanocarbon. The all-solid-state lithium-sulfur battery with this composite electrode shows a high capacity of 1100 mA h g(-1) per sulfur after 400 cycles at a high current density of 1.3 mA cm(-2) at 25 degrees C. These findings are expected to contribute toward the development of practical all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, a layered carbide derived carbon (CDC) with hierarchically porous structure is designed and used as sulfur host for high rate lithium-sulfur batteries for the first time. In the layered CDC, sulfur was mainly infiltrated into the micropores and small mesopores, which could efficiently confine sulfur species and suppress polysulfides shuttling. At the same time, the layered structure and large mesopores would further shorten ion diffusion distance and buffer volume expansion. As a result, the layered CDC/sulfur composite with a sulfur loading of 50 wt.% delivered not only a high initial discharge capacity of 1229 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C, but also a superior reversible capacity of 621 mAh g(-1) at 5C. Especially, the high rate capability could also be achieved even at a higher sulfur loading (68 wt.%). This work suggests that porous carbon combined with layered structure and hierarchical pores could be used as effective matrix to host sulfur for high rate lithium-sulfur batteries.

An estimation of the residence time of the polysulfide on the oxidized surface is made based on transition state theory, with the finding that the studied oxidized graphene surfaces are not good enough candidates to prevent polysulfide migration in lithium-sulfur batteries. Even a value of 1.45 eV of the binding energy of the polysulfide to the surface is not enough to retain polysulfide for an important residence time.

Herein, the synthesis of a flexible freestanding sulfur/polyacrylonitrile/graphene oxide (S/PAN/GO) as the cathode for Li/S batteries by simple method via vacuum filtration is reported. The S/PAN/GO hybrid binder-free electrode is considered as one of the most promising cathodes for Li/S batteries. Graphene oxide (GO) slice structure provides effective ion conductivity channels and increases structural stability of the ternary system, resulting in excellent electrochemical properties of the freestanding S/PAN/GO cathode. Additionally, graphene oxide (GO) membrane was able to minimize the polysulfides' dissolution and their shuttle, which was attributed to the electrostatic interactions between the negatively-charged species and the oxygen functional groups on GO. Furthermore, these oxygen-containing functional groups including carboxyl, epoxide and hydroxyl groups provide active sites for coordination with inorganic materials (such as sulfur). It exhibits the initial reversible specific capacity of 1379 mAh.g(-1) at a constant current rate of 0.2 C and maintains 1205 mAh.g(-1) over 100 cycles (similar to 87% retention). In addition, the freestanding S/PAN/GO cathode displays excellent coulombic efficiency (similar to 100%) and rate capability, delivering up to 685 mAh.g(-1) capacity at 2 C.

Molybdenum diphosphide acts as the catalyst and can capture polysulfides and improve the polysulfide conversion activity during the discharge/charge processes. The CNT film acts as a conductive skeleton to support the MoP2 nanoparticles and to ensure their uniform distribution. The CNT film physically hinders polysulfide migration, acts as a current collector, and provides abundant electron pathways. The Li-S battery containing the multifunctional MoP2/CNT interlayer exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. It delivers a reversible specific capacity of 905 mA h g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.2 C, with a capacity decay of 0.152% per cycle. These results suggest the introduction of the multifunctional CNT/MoP2 interlayer as an effective and practical method for producing high-performance Li-S batteries.

Rational design of multifunctional sulfur cathodes with porous conductive matrix and large polar sites is greatly desired. Herein, we report three-dimensional hierarchical porous TiO2/graphene aerogel (TiO2/GA) composites as promising anchoring materials for sulfur species. Various TiO2/GA composites with 3.5, 15.3, 54.6 and 75.2 wt% TiO2 are synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal process. Specifically, the one containing 15.3 wt% TiO2 exhibits a superior boost in specific capacity, rate capability and cyclability. The factors contribute to the high performance attributing much to the strong interfacial chemical and physical interactions of TiO2/GA with Li2Sn. Moreover, further improved sulfur utilization is achieved by adding glucose to adjust the surface area and pore size distribution of the aerogels. At a high rate of 2 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)), an initial discharge capacity up to 1011 mAh g(-1) is obtained with a decent cyclic efficiency and 100% coulombic efficiency over 500 cycles. These results bring a broad perspective for the future design on practical sulfur-based electrodes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The exploration of better material combinations is imperative to deal with the issue. With this objective, a grain-like lithium cobalt vanadate embedded graphene nanoplatelets (GLCVO) is designed as a potent sulfur host in Li-S batteries. The composite cathode with preferable active sites is found to be highly efficacious in capturing the polysulfides through strong chemical interaction as well as propelling the polysulfide conversion reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the graphene nanoplatelets render an interconnected pathway for electronic conduction. As a direct consequence, the GSLCVO cell evinces an initial discharge capacity of 982 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C rate and maintains excellent cyclability with a low attenuation rate of 0.031% over 800 cycles. Besides, the cell exhibits better static stability and attenuates the self-discharge behavior to a great extent. The detailed structural and electrochemical evaluation cooperatively reveals its excellent electrochemical properties which makes it an attractive cathode material for LSBs.

We herein demonstrated that hierarchical ordered micro/mesoporous carbons with controllable porosity and nitrogen functionality could be prepared via two scalable steps which are based on aqueous self-assembly and ammonia activation processes. The effects of porosity and nitrogen doping upon the electrochemical performances of the carbon/sulfur hybrids as the cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries were investigated. It demonstrated that the carbon materials with balanced porosity and nitrogen-doping level could effectively increase the conductivity of sulfur and alleviate the shuttle effect and exhibit high specific capacity, good rate performance, and superior cycling stability.

However, great challenges still remain in achieving high sulfur loading and long cycle life. Herein we report a well-designed sulfur-rich copolymer@ 3D graphene-carbon nanotubes (G-CNT) network cathode for high-performance Li-S batteries. The sulfur-rich copolymer (87.29% sulfur) synthesised by inverse vulcanization between two eco-friendly sources, sulfur and squalene, can greatly suppress the dissolution of sulfur and polusulfides due to the chemical confinement from the crosslinking of polysulfur chains with the squalene molecules. The interlinked Spa G-CNT network can not only further enhance the polysulfide entrapment capability, but also provide the composite with an 3D electrical conductive path as well as an eminent mechanical resilience towards the huge volume change of sulfur. The as-developed cathode can deliver a high specific capacity of 1265 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C with excellent rate performance and cycling stability (782 mAh g(-1) at after 300 cycles at 1C).

In this study, we construct a dual functional modification system, including iodine-doped soft carbon (I-SC) and iodine functional separator for Li S batteries. The formation of C-I bonds in the carbon skeleton increases the carbon interlayer spacing and displays a powerful chemical adsorption ability and electrocatalytic activity for polysulfide conversion. In addition, semi-hollow micro-rods-structure soft carbon not only accommodates the volume expansion of sulfur, but also provides a continuous conductive network to transport Li+ and electrons over cycling. Furthermore, by assisting with poly- iodide (e.g., I-3(-) and I-3(-)) modified separator, the polysulfide migration can be further controlled, resulting in a high capacity of 956 mAhg(-1) at 0.2 C after 300 cycles. This work represents the importance of I-doping and provides the potential of soft carbon for low-cost and scalable fabrication of energy storage systems.

Herein, a graphene-based mesoporous SnO2 is designed and used as a multifunctional host to accommodate sulfur. SnO2 nanofilms with perpendicular mesochannels on graphene are able to not only immobilize lithium polysulfides through chemical adsorption and the pore constraints but also promote polysulfide redox reactions, which effectively suppress the shuttle effect during the charge and discharge process. Meanwhile, the conductive graphene substrate offers a good conductive network and stabilizes the mesostructure of SnO2 nanofilms during cycling. As a result, the designed hybrid with a high sulfur loading (69 wt %) exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance including a reversible capacity of 1380 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C over 200 cycles, and 680 mA h g(-1) at 2 C over 500 cycles. Integration of mesoporous metal oxides with two-dimensional conductive substrates as multifunctional hosts provides a new approach for the design of high-performance cathode materials lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this structure, the bifunctional HCNF provides excellent electrical conductivity and physical confinement of polysulfides. The porous delta-MnO2 coated on the wall HCNF provides more adsorption sites of polysulfides due to the large surface area. Due to the synergistic effect between HCNF and mesoporous delta-MnO2, the Li -S batteries with simple cathode (sulfur content reach 70 wt%) structure and HCNF@delta-MnO2 (coating thickness 2 [im) modified separator delivers an initial capacity of 1156 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and a reversible capacity of 856.1 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 degrees C.

However, their practical application is limited by low capacity and rapid capacity fading at commerical-level mass loadings, which is largely attributed to the inferior electron/ion conduction, as well as severe the shuttling effect of soluble polysulfide species. To address these issues, a three-dimensional holey graphene/polyacrylonitrile sulfur (3DHG/PS) composite cathode is developed for high-mass-loading Li-S batteries. The unique architectural design with the 3D holey graphene framework ensures fast electron and ion transport within the thick electrode, and affords enough space for mitigating the volume expansion of the electrode. Moreover, in situ Raman results demonstrate that covalent sulfur within 3DHG/PS fundamentally avoids forming soluble lithium polysulfides, which effectively reduces the undesired shuttling effect. With these advantages, the 3DHG/PS cathode exhibits an ultra-low capacity fading rate of 0.012% per cycle after continuous 1500 cycles, as well as high specific capacity and superior rate capability with a high mass loading of 15.2 mg cm(-2), which offers a promising avenue to construct future Li-S batteries with superior performance at mass loadings that exceed commercial levels.

With these requirements, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries promise great potential to be the next-generation high-energy system. However, the practicality of Li-S technology is hindered by technical obstacles, such as short shelf and cycle life and low sulfur content/loading, arising from the shuttling of polysulfide intermediates between the cathode and anode and the poor electronic conductivity of S and the discharge product Li2S. Much progress has been made during the past five years to circumvent these problems by employing sulfur-carbon or sulfur-polymer composite cathodes, novel cell configurations, and lithium-metal anode stabilization. This Progress Report highlights recent developments with special attention toward innovation in sulfur-encapsulation techniques, development of novel materials, and cell-component design. The scientific understanding and engineering concerns are discussed at the end in every developmental stage. The critical research directions needed and the remaining challenges to be addressed are summarized in the Conclusion.

In this work, we have successfully prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (NPCN) by using low-cost raw materials (monosodium glutamate) via a facile carbonization approach without any activation process. The obtained NPCN-800 possesses a special micro/mesoporous structure, with a relatively high BET surface area and appropriate nitrogen doping. By employing the NPCN-800 as a reservoir to impregnate sulfur as the cathode material of lithium-sulfur batteries, the resulting sulfur/carbon composite with 65.5 wt% sulfur exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1070 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and enhanced capacity retention of 680 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles. Moreover, a capacity of 452 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C is achieved over 200 cycles with 98.6% Coulombic efficiency. The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the hierarchical porous structure (physisorption) and N-doping (chemisorption).

However, the poor electric/ionic conductivity of sulfur limits the practical use of sulfur in an electrode. The main problem is the high solubility of long-chain polysulfides, which are the intermediates of the electrochemical processes in the liquid electrolyte. The dissolved polysulfide ions shuttle between the cathode and anode, thus causing precipitation of insulating Li2S2/Li2S on the surface of the electrode. The unavoidable phenomenon results in loss of active materials and fast capacity fading. In this regard, we show one simple method to prepare freestanding paper electrode used as cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries. Binder-free graphenepolypyrrole (PPy)/S-graphene (G-PPy/S-G) paper-like sandwich structural electrode was prepared by using the vacuum filtration method. In this structure, the unique graphene layers of sandwich-like framework not only serve as a conductive film, but also effectively block the diffusion of polysulfides, leading to suppression of the shuttle effect and low self-discharge behaviour. In addition, the middle layer, the PPy nanofibers can limit the diffusion of dissolved polysulfides due to the special bond with sulfur, and furthermore maintain the structural stability of the paper electrode because the nanofibers can serve as elastic springs to accommodate the huge volume changes in charging-discharging processes. When tested as cathode for Li-S batteries, the as-prepared sample G-PPy/S-G exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. We believe that our strategy could provide a useful pathway towards commercial utilizing of sulfur. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we report self-assembly sandwiches composed of zeolitic-imidazolate-frameworks (ZIF-8)-derived mesoporous carbons (ZIF-8(C)) in between reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layers, which are filled with sulfurs inside and coated with poly(3, 4ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) outside (noted as P@rGO/ZIF-8(C)). During the synthesis process, the rGO layers stabilize the structure of ZIF-8 nanocrystals to obtain large specific surface area and high electric conductivity of mesoporous materials (rGO/ZIF-8(C)), ensuring accommodation of a large amount of sulfur and the efficient utilization of the confined sulfur. The mesoporous rGO/ZIF-8(C), PEDOT and N-doping provide physical absorption and chemical binding to the polysulfides during cycles. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with the composite cathodes exhibit the high capacity of 1308 mAh g(-1) and 865 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and 1 C, respectively, and a very low capacity fading of 0.03% per cycle after 500 reversible cycles at 1 C rate. The results indicate that the P@rGO/ZIF-8(C)-S composite cathode may offer a feasible strategy for construction of sulfur cathodes for high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the low conductivity of S gives rise to a poor specific capacity. Moreover, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS) causes a rapid performance deterioration in Li-S systems. Herein, Co9S8 implanted on N-doped graphene (Co9S8-NG) is proposed to support S in cathodes. The N-doped graphene substantially enhanced the electronic conductivity of the S-based cathode. Meanwhile, Co9S8 with a high polarity not only effectively immobilized the LiPS species through chemical binding but also considerably catalyzed the LiPS electrochemical conversion, ultimately suppressing its shuttle effect. As expect, the cathode with the Co9S8-NG composite demonstrated high specific capacities of 1051.5 and 564.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 and 2 C, respectively. Moreover, a satisfactory cycling stability was displayed at 1 C for 400 cycles, with an average capacity fading of 0.085% per cycle. Therefore, Co9S8-NG was exhibited to improve the cathode performance in numerous aspects and can be regarded as a potential host material to improve the overall performance of Li-S batteries.

Herein, simultaneously exfoliated boron-doped graphene sheets (B-EEGs) are prepared via electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in a 1.0 mol L-1 Li bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB)/dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) electrolyte. The obtained B-EEG possesses high quality with a large planar size of similar to 11 mu m, few structure defects of I-D/I-G = 0.26, and low oxygen content of 7.93%. After B-EEG is used to encapsulate S through an in situ deposition route, the S@B-EEG with an S content of 72.5% displays a high initial discharge capacity of 1476 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. Compared to a conventional S@thermally reduced graphene oxide (S@T-RGO) composite, the S@B-EEG composite exhibits a high capability of 1018 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and excellent capacity retention of 838 mAh g(-1) after 130 cycles. On one hand, the excellent electrochemical performances of SpB-EEG are primarily attributed to the few defects and big planar size of B-EEG, which is helpful for increasing the conductivity of S and suppressing the shuttle of long-chain polysulfides. On the other hand, the doped boron atoms as active sites can efficiently trap polysulfides by chemical adsorption.

With such a configuration, LSBs show a superior rate capacity and improved cycling capacity. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the strong bonding interactions between the MoS2/graphene interlayer and the formed lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) as well as the good electrical conductivity of the MoS2/graphene composite. The MoS2/graphene interlayer can physically block LiPSs by the graphene nanosheets and chemically suppress the dissolution of LiPSs by the polar MoS2 nanoflowers. Such a dual functional interlayer further provides a good contact with the surface of the sulfur cathode, acts as an upper current collector and greatly improves the sulfur utilization and the rate capability of LSBs.

Nevertheless, the shuttle effect of dissoluble sulfurous intermediates is the primary obstacle which hinders their practical application. Herein, a porous carbon fiber membrane embedded with cobalt nanoparticles (Co-PCNF) was prepared by electrostatic spinning, then the active material was firmly fixed between the two layers of Co-PCNF to form a unique sandwich structure. With this strategy, an aluminum foil current collector can be replaced by the Co-PCNF sandwich structure, which is helpful to improve the energy density of Li-S battery as well as coordinate the volume change of sulfur in the process of charge and discharge, what's more, the shuttle effect is significantly inhibited. Results show that the as-assembled battery delivers an initial discharge specific capacities of 1013.3 mAh g(-1) and 933.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and 1C, together with the decay rate of only 0.04% and 0.08% per cycle over 500 cycles, respectively. Moreover, the larger sulfur load (2.2 mg cm(-2)) still has the discharge specific capacity of 1009.8 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles at 0.2C. This Co-PCNF sandwich electrode may provide a new idea for the structural design for Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Consequently, the full passivation of carbon, by deposition of sulfur and/or Li2S, would necessarily produce the death of the battery. However, here we demonstrate that for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries operated under lean electrolyte conditions (electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 6 mu L mg(S)(-1) in Li-S coin cells), the extent of passivation of carbon is not severe enough to limit performance. This is shown by performing impedance measurements of fully charged lithium-sulfur batteries, from which we demonstrate that we can evaluate the specific surface area of carbon, and we find that the capacity fade with cycling is not due to a decrease in the electrochemically active surface area of carbon. These results show that introducing a higher surface area carbon in the sulfur electrode formulation is not needed to prevent passivation, and that the focus of lithium-sulfur development should be directed towards other issues, such as mitigating undesirable reactions at the lithium electrode and achieving robust sulfur electrode structures enabling fast transport of electrolyte species and, thus, more homogeneous reactions.

The main challenge in developing highly efficient and long-life Li-S batteries is simultaneously suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the redox kinetics. Polar host materials have desirable chemisorptive properties to localize the mobile polysulfide intermediates; however, the role of their electrical conductivity in the redox kinetics of subsequent electrochemical reactions is not fully understood. Conductive polar titanium carbides (TiC) are shown to increase the intrinsic activity towards liquid-liquid polysulfide interconversion and liquid-solid precipitation of lithium sulfides more than non-polar carbon and semiconducting titanium dioxides. The enhanced electrochemical kinetics on a polar conductor guided the design of novel hybrid host materials of TiC nanoparticles grown within a porous graphene framework (TiC@G). With a high sulfur loading of 3.5 mg cm(-2), the TiC@G/sulfur composite cathode exhibited a substantially enhanced electrochemical performance.

However, the theoretical specific capacity of the sulfur cathode for lithium-sulfur battery is 1675 mAh g(-1) and the energy density is 2600 Wh kg(-1). However, lithium-sulfur batteries suffer from three problems: "shuttle effect," sulfur electron/ion insulation, and volume expansion. Moreover, the carbon materials or metal sulfides alone cannot achieve the dual effects of excellent conductivity and chemisorption as sulfur carriers. Therefore, 350 nm and 1 mu m of polyhedron with mesoporous carbon and Co3S4 were prepared (denoted as C/Co3S4@S (S) for the small one and C/Co3S4@S (L) for the large one, respectively) using PVP modified self-assembled Co-MOFs as a sacrificial template. The C/Co3S4 (S) carrier provided a sulfur-filled channel, and shortened the electron transport path with excellent conductivity. Simultaneously, the polar Co3S4 chemisorption of polysulfide and hollow structure provided a sufficient storage for sulfur. As the cathode of lithium-sulfur battery, C/Co3S4@S (S) exhibited an initial capacity of 1153 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, and the capacity decay rate per cycle is only 0.057% during 500 cycles at 1 C, compared to 1 mu m C/Co3S4@S (L) efficiently improved the cycle stability.

Highly porous activated carbon foam (ACF) with micromesoporosity has been synthesized through carbonizing pomelo peel and activating by KOH. Elemental sulfur has been loaded to the micropores through a solution infiltration method to form a S/ACF nanocomposite. The resulted S/ACF nanocomposite with 60% sulfur has been tested as novel cathodes for Li-S batteries. The S/ACF nanocomposite showed an initial discharge capacity of 1258 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C rate. After 100 cycles of charge/discharge, the S/ACF nanocomposite retained a high specific capacity of 750 mAh g(-1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 96%. The material delivered a capacity of more than 700 mAh g(-1) at 2C rate and can be recovered to 880 mAh g(-1) when the rate is returned to 0.2C. The results show that the ACF with 3D connected structure could be a promising binder-free cathode supporter for rechargeable Li-S battery with high specific energy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Material characterization and electrochemical performance tests indicated that batteries (S/AC/CF1, S/AC/CF2, and S/AC/CF3), with carbon films inserted between the cathode and separator, showed improved electrochemical properties than S/AC without interlayers.

The sulfur content in the MLSC electrode was maintained at 60 wt%. The MLSC electrode delivered a high initial reversible discharge capacity of 913 mAh g(-1) and maintained a capacity of 736 mAh g(-1), indicating excellent capacity retention. In addition, the coulombic efficiency of the MLSC electrode was over 92% throughout the total cycling, demonstrating superior cycling stability. It exhibited the initial discharge capacities at 0.2 and 2C of 951 and 642 mAh g(-1), respectively, with 68% rate capability (2C/0.2C). These results indicate that the carbon nanotube film-wrapped structure of the MLSC electrode enables rapid electron transport in the electrode owing to its good electrical conductivity, and that it successfully suppresses the dissolution of lithium polysulfide in the electrolyte. Further, the MLSC electrode was stable during folding and bending in pouch cells. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, they have many problems, especially the large volume change during cycling and the shuttle effect of the soluble polysulfides. To solve these problems, a three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbon (3D-HPC) was investigated as the sulfur host of a lithium-sulfur battery. The 3D-HPC was prepared by a template method using polymethyl methacrylate and zinc oxide as the templates to form mesopores and macropores, respectively. The results showed that the interconnected macroporous channels and abundant large mesopores formed a three-dimensional conductive carbon network which is beneficial for electron/ion transfer and relieves the cathode volume change by the physical limiting effect. The pores alleviate the shuttle effect by the capillary condensation. A 3D-HPC-S composite used as the cathode has excellent electrochemical properties. The first discharge specific capacity of the 3D-HPC-S is 1314.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with a sulfur loading of 70%. After 100 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 69.13%. At 0.5 C, the capacity retention rate after 200 cycles is 59.02% and the average coulombic efficiency is 98.16%.

To accelerate the development of lithium-sulfur technology, it is necessary to address the intrinsic material and extrinsic technological challenges brought about by the insulating active solid-state materials and the soluble active liquid-state materials. Herein, we report a systematic investigation of module-designed carbon-coated separators, where the carbon coating layer on the polypropylene membrane decreases the irreversible loss of dissolved polysulfides and increases the reaction kinetics of the high-loading sulfur cathode. Eight different conductive carbon coatings were considered to investigate how the materials' characteristics contribute to the lithium-sulfur cell's cathode performance. The cell with a nonporous-carbon-coated separator delivered an optimized peak capacity of 1112 mA center dot h g(-1) at a cycling rate of C/10 and retained a high reversible capacity of 710 mA center dot h g(-1) after 200 cycles under lean-electrolyte conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical high specific capacity of the cathode and its commercial potential, achieving high sulfur loading and content of 4.0 mg cm(-2) and 70 wt%, respectively, and attaining high areal and gravimetric capacities of 4.45 mA center dot h cm(-2) and 778 mA center dot h g(-1), respectively.

Nevertheless, lithium-sulfur batteries still face difficulties such as low cycle life and shuttle effect. To solve these problems, we designed S/Core-shell CeO2/porous carbon as a kind of cathode material for Li-S batteries by template method. CA as the carbon source of the porous carbon and the core-shell CeO2 had a synergistic effect which played physical and chemical adsorption for polysulfides roles. XRD, SEM, and TEM tested the crystalline structure and core-shell structure of the material, combined with XPS to demonstrate the element valence states of Ce, C, and S. The initial discharge specific capacity of S/CS-CeO2/PC composite cathode reached 1242.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.25 C. The average coulombic efficiency was 92.36 % after 500 cycles, with only 0.015 % attenuation per cycle. S/CS-CeO2/PC exhibited good electrochemical performance, cycle life, and stability.

The S@PPy nanoparticles are synthesized by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of pyrrole on the surface of sulfur particles, and then graphene sheets are covered outside the S@PPy nanoparticles, forming a three-dimensional conductive network. When evaluating the electrochemical performance of S@PPy/GS in a lithium-sulfur battery, it delivers large discharge capacity, excellent cycle stability, and good rate capability. The initial discharge capacity is up to 1040 mAh/g at 0.1 C, the capacity can remain 537.8 mAh/g at 0.2 C after 200 cycles, even at a higher rate of 1 C, the specific capacity still reaches 566.5 mAh/g. The good electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique structure of S@PPy/GS, which can not only provide an excellent transport of lithium and electron ions within the electrodes, but also retard the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides effectively, thus plays a positive role in building better lithium-sulfur batteries.

To enhance the cycling stability of sulfur cathode for high-energy lithium sulfur batteries, it is very critical to mitigating the dissolution of polysulfides. In this work, a caterpillar-like and reconfigurable graphene was designed to serve a the sulfur host. The caterpillar-like graphene highly expanded in solution and tightly restacked in dry condition due to the van der Waals force. Elemental sulfur was trapped and confined inside the restacked graphene layers. High mass loading of 63.8% sulfur in graphene was achieved after the caterpillar-like graphene was dried at 155 degrees C. The graphene-sulfur electrode has a good rate performance of 708 mAh g(-1) at 167.5 mA g(-1), 582 mAh g(-1) at 335 mA 470 mAh g(-1) at 837.5 mA g(-1), 400 mAh g(-1) at 1675 mA g(-1) and a stable cycling performance with small capacity decay of 0.16% per cycle over 200 cycles at 1675 mA g(-1). Moreover, the underlying mechanism of the restacking effect of caterpillar-like graphene on immobilizing the soluble lithium polysulfides was studied by density functional theory (DFT), which clearly explained how the graphene immobilized the soluble lithium polysulfides by the restacking effect.

The interlayer placed between the separator and the sulfur cathode plays many synergistic roles, offering (i) a number of macropores within the nanofiber web to facilitate ion transport and electrolyte penetration, (ii) nitrogen-containing functional groups that entrap soluble polysulfides by strong interatomic attraction, and (iii) much enhanced electron/ion transfer due to the high electrical conductivity of the CNF web. The battery delivers an excellent specific discharge capacity of 893 mA h/g after 100 cycles, maintaining 76% of its initial capacity of 1177 mA h/g.

To address these issues, nitrogen-doped cubic carbon (NC) interwoven with carbon nanotubes (CNT) host is introduced to achieve high sulfur content for lithium-sulfur batteries. The NC/CNT composites are derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which can physically confine sulfur, thus providing efficient sulfur loading. The sulfur content in the as-obtained S@NC/CNT composite is as high as 89 wt%, while the cathode membrane has a sulfur loading of 3.6 mg cm(-2). In addition, the NC/CNT composite can obstruct the dissolution and outward diffusion of polysulfides. Impressively, under the high sulfur content and high sulfur loading conditions, the S@NC/CNT cell exhibits initial specific capacity of 1141 mA h g(-1) at the current rate of 0.5C (837.5 mA g(-1)) and the capacity retains 674.4 mA h g(-1) after 120 cycles.

Rambutan peel derived porous carbons (RPC) with high surface area of 2104 m(2) g(-1) and large pore volume of 1.2 cm(3) g(-1) were obtained at KOH/carbon ratio of 4 and activation temperature of 900 degrees C. The as-obtained porous carbons were capable of encapsulating sulfur with a high loading of 68.2 wt% to form RPC/S composite cathode for lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery. High specific discharge capacities of about 1275 mAh g(-1) were demonstrated by the RPC/S composites at 0.1 C.

However, the shuttling effect of the formed lithium polysulfides, as well as their low conductivity, compromise the electro-chemical performance of lithium-sulfur cells. To tackle this challenge, a so far unexplored cathode, composed of sulfur covalently bonded directly on graphene is developed. This is achieved by leveraging the nucleophilicity of polysulfide chains, which react readily with the electrophilic centers in fluorographene, as experimental and theoretical data unveil. The reaction leads to the formation of carbon-sulfur covalent bonds and a particularly high sulfur content of 80 mass%. Owing to these features, the developed cathode exhibits excellent performance with only 5 mass% of conductive carbon additive, delivering very high full-cathode-mass capacities and rate capability, combined with superior cycling stability. In combination with a fluorinated ether as electrolyte additive, the capacity persists at approximate to 700 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, and at approximate to 644 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.2 C, keeping approximate to 470 mAh g(-1) even after 500 cycles.

However, the sulfur cathode has several shortcomings, including fast capacity attenuation, poor electrochemical activity, and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene oxide (GO), and manganese dioxide are introduced to the sulfur cathode. A MnO2/GO/CNTs-S composite with a unique three-dimensional (3D) architecture was synthesized by a one-pot chemical method and heat treatment approach. In this structure, the innermost CNTs work as a conducting additive and backbone to form a conducting network. The MnO2/GO nanosheets anchored on the sidewalls of CNTs have a dual-efficient absorption capability for polysulfide intermediates as well as afford adequate space for sulfur loading. The outmost nanosized sulfur particles are well-distributed on the surface of the MnO2/GO nanosheets and provide a short transmission path for Li+ and the electrons. The sulfur content in the MnO2/GO/CNTs-S composite is as high as 80 wt %, and the as-designed MnO2/GO/CNTs-S cathode displays excellent comprehensive performance. The initial specific capacities are up to 1500, 1300, 1150, 1048, and 960 mAh g(-1) at discharging rates of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 C, respectively. Moreover, the composite cathode shows a good cycle performance: the specific capacity remains at 963.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles when the area density of sulfur is 2.8 mg cm(-2).

Blocking Polysulfides in Graphene-Sulfur Cathodes of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries through Atomic Layer Deposition of Alumina	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						alumina coatings; atomic layer deposition; cathodes; graphene sheets; lithium-sulfur batteries; nanoparticles	LI-S BATTERIES; ION BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODE; AL2O3; STABILIZATION; CHALLENGES; STRATEGIES; NANOSHEETS; COMPOSITE	A lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is one of the post-lithium-ion battery chemistry candidates due to the high theoretical capacity of the sulfur cathode (1672 mAh g(-1)). However, low electronic conductivity of sulfur and severe capacity fading during the charge-discharge process limit the commercial realization of Li-S batteries. The origin of capacity fading is mainly due to the polysulfide shuttling effect, resulting from the dissolution of sulfur in the electrolyte solution. Herein, atomic layer deposition (ALD) (6-8 angstrom thickness) of alumina is presented as a strategy to suppress capacity degradation on the 2D graphene-sulfur hybrid electrode. Low-temperature ALD prevents sulfur sublimation from the composite electrode. Despite the insulating property of alumina, atomic layer coating maintains good electrical conductivity, thereby yielding lower charge transfer resistance. Alumina-coated graphene-sulfur hybrid electrodes (AGS) exhibit a high specific capacity of 960 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 50 mA g(-1) and retain 519 mAh g(-1) after 100 galvanostatic cycles. Superior electrochemical performance is credited to the combination of the high electronic conductivity of multilayered graphene platelets and low charge transfer resistance, resulting from effective polysulfide blocking by the atomic scale Al2O3 coating.

Sulfur/carbon cathode in Li-S batteries still suffers, however, from low Coulombic efficiency and poor cycle life when sulfur loading and the ratio of sulfur to carbon are high. Here, we address these challenges by fabricating a sulfur/carboxylated-graphene composite using a reverse (water-in-oil) micro emulsion technique. The fabricated sulfur-graphene composite cathode, which contains only 6 wt % graphene, can dramatically improve the cycling stability as well as provide high capacity. The electro-chemical performance of the sulfur-graphene composite is further enhanced after loading into a three-dimensional heteroatom-doped (boron and nitrogen) carbon-cloth current collector. Even at high sulfur loading (similar to 8 mg/cm(2)) on carbon cloth, this composite showed 1256 mAh/g discharge capacity with more than 99% capacity retention after 200 cycles.

In this study, crumpled N-doped graphene anchored with cobalt (Co-NCG) was fabricated in one pot via a sample solvothermal method and applied to lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The crumpled structure not only gives graphene a large specific surface area and abundant pores, but also endows graphene superb stability by preventing its restacking; these features are beneficial for loading and efficient utilization of sulfur. The lone pair electrons on the nitrogen atom underwent strong chemical interactions with Li ions, which lent the Co-NCG/S material the ability to chemically immobilize polysulfide species.

However, the catalytic conversion effect on polysulfides is limited because the weak electronic interactions between the composite interfaces cannot fundamentally improve the intrinsic electronic conductivity of MoS2. Herein, density functional theory calculations reveal that the MoS2 and nitrogen-doped carbon composite with an Mo-O-C bond can promote the catalytic conversion of polysulfides with a Gibbs free energy of only 0.19 eV and a low dissociation energy barrier of 0.48 eV, owing to the strong covalent coupling effect on the heterogeneous interface. Guided by theoretical calculations, a robust MoS2 strongly coupled with a 3D carbon matrix composed of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide and carbonized melamine foam is designed and constructed as a multifunctional coating layer for lithium-sulfur batteries. As a result, excellent electrochemical performance is achieved for Li-S batteries, with a capacity of 615 mAh g(-1) at 5 C, an areal capacity of 6.11 mAh cm(-2), and a low self-discharge of only 8.6% by resting for five days at 0.5 C. This study opens a new avenue for designing 2D material composites toward promoted catalytic conversion of polysulfides.

Encapsulating S with a conductive agent is considered as an effective way to address these issues. The electrical conductivity of the electrode is substantially improved by the addition of a conductive agent. Furthermore, the polysulfide dissolution is also effectively suppressed by the physical/chemical confinement of the additives. An exploration of new encapsulation agents for the S cathode-hierarchical porous carbon derived from a peanut hull is reported. Such structures comprise the 3D interconnected network carbon and abundant meso/micropores, which significantly improve the electronic conductivity and effectively suppress the polysulfide dissolution. The high S loading, long lifespan, and great rate capability empower such a strategy to be an effective way to push the Li-S battery to further development.

Hydrophilic and hydrophobic OMC materials were prepared using different carbon precursors including sucrose (suc-OMC) and phenanthrene (phe-OMC) at different carbonization temperatures of 700 degrees C and 1100 degrees C, respectively. The OMC materials thus obtained exhibit high surface areas, uniform mesopore sizes and highly ordered meso-structure. To investigate the hydrophilicity effect of OMC materials on the performance of lithium-sulfur battery, we prepared the samples having different ratios of the suc-OMC to phe-OMC, which were 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100. As a result, the mixed OMC materials (with ratios of 75:25, 50:50 and 25:75) exhibited better cycle performances, compared to those of the suc-OMC and phe-OMC.

Tailoring Porosity in Carbon Nanospheres for Lithium-Sulfur Battery Cathodes	ACS NANO			English	Article						lithium-sulfur battery; sulfur cathode; hollow nanospheres; mesoporous carbon	ONE-STEP; LI-ION; SPHERES; CAPACITY; POLYMER	Porous hollow carbon spheres with different tailored pore structures have been designed as conducting frameworks for lithium-sulfur battery cathode materials that exhibit stable cycling capacity. By deliberately creating shell porosity and utilizing the interior void volume of the carbon spheres, sufficient space for sulfur storage as well as electrolyte pathways is guaranteed. The effect of different approaches to develop shell porosity is examined and compared in this study. The most highly optimized sulfur-porous carbon nanosphere composite, created using pore-formers to tailor shell porosity, exhibits excellent cycling performance and rate capability. Sulfur is primarily confined in 4-5 nm mesopores in the carbon shell and inner lining of the shells, which is beneficial for enhancing charge transfer and accommodating volume expansion of sulfur during redox cycling. Little capacity degradation (similar to 0.1%/cycle) is observed over 100 cycles for the optimized material.

However, they suffer from fast capacity fading due to the shuttle of the dissolved polysulfides. Using small sulfur molecules (S2-4) as cathodes can avoid the shuttle problem, but the preparation of ultra-microporous carbon to encapsulate S2-4 is challenging. Here, we report a Li-S battery with an excellent cycling performance by using a unique ultra-microporous carbon (UMC) with a uniform pore size of 0.55 nm. The UMC was synthesized from PVDF via a facile pyrolysis process to only accommodate small S2-4 molecules and eliminate large S-8 molecules. This S/UMC composite electrode is compatible with the carbonate-based electrolyte used in Li-S batteries. The resulting battery shows a typical discharging profile with only one long potential plateau because the reductions from cyclo-S-8 to dissolved polysulfides and consequence shuttle problem are avoided. The S/UMC composite retains a capacity of about 852 mAh g(-1) and Coulombic efficiency approaching 100% after 150 cycles at 0.1 C and delivers a long-term cycling at 1 C for 1000 cycles with only around 0.03% capacity loss per cycle. We also tested this S/UMC composite electrode in Na-S systems and observed similar electrochemical behaviour. These results indicate that the S/UMC composite is a promising candidate as an electrode material in Li-S and Na-S batteries and related systems.

Among different cathode systems, graphene-sulfur composites are widely utilized in lithium-sulfur batteries and their electrochemical performances are directly linked to syntheses methods. In this study, graphene-sulfur composite cathodes were prepared by three distinct routes and their performances were evaluated in all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries where the lithium and Li(7)P(3)S(11)were utilized as anode and solid electrolyte, respectively. Our results indicate that cathodes prepared by solution-based techniques were found to impart higher capacity and cycling stability compared with cathode prepared by the melt-diffusion method. Better performance was attributed to fine and homogeneously distributed particles obtained in cathodes prepared by solution-based techniques. Besides, higher capacity was acquired in the cathodes where the sulfur was obtained through reduction from Na(2)S(2)O(3)instead of utilizing sulfur in elemental powder form. Among three different cathodes synthesized by different routes, the best performance was gained in the cathode prepared by sulfur-amine chemistry method where the sulfur was obtained by reduction from Na(2)S(2)O(3)with 970 mAh g(-1)and 795 mAh g(-1)initial and after 200 cycles discharge capacity respectively. Our results indicate the significance of particle size and intimate contact between components on the electrochemical performance of the sulfur-based cathodes and the synthesis route to follow for high-performance all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries.

Then sulfur-activated carbon aerogels (S-ACAs) composites were synthesized by chemical deposition strategy. The S-ACAs composites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy, and N-2 adsorption/desorption measurements. It is found that the activated carbon aerogels treated by KOH activation presents a porous structure, and sulfur is embedded into the pores of the ACAs network-like matrix after a chemical deposition process. The Li/S-ACAs (with 69.1 wt% active material) composite cathode exhibits discharge capacities of 1,493 mAh g(-1) in the first cycle and 528 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a higher rate of C/5 (335 mA g(-1)). The S-ACAs composite cathode exhibits better electrochemical reversibility, higher active material utilization, and less severe polysulfide shuttle than S-CAs composite cathode because of high bimodal porosity structure of the ACAs matrix.

Further, exploration of the concept of electrocatalysts plays a significant role in enhancing the electrochemical reversibility of polysulfides in lithium-sulfur battery. Herein, ruthenium nanoparticles-decorated porous, hollow carbon spheres have been successfully prepared and deployed as electrocatalyst as well as sulfur host in the lithium sulfur battery assembly. Interaction of sulfur with ruthenium nanoparticles has been explained with appropriate electroanalytical and electrochemical characterization techniques. We observe that lithium-sulfur battery containing C-Ru-S cathode with a fixed sulfur loading exhibits a significantly improved capacity of 1200 mA h g(-1) at C/10 current rate for 100 cycles. Volume expansion-related issues are found to get addressed by the hollow structured carbon spheres, and the electrocatalytic activity will improve the reaction kinetics of the conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S and vice versa.

Furthermore, flexible and wearable electronics urgently requires their power sources to be mechanically robust and flexible. However, the effective progress of high-performance, flexible Li-S batteries is still hindered by the poor conductivity of sulfur cathodes and the dissolution of lithium polysulfides as well as the weak mechanical properties of sulfur cathodes. Herein, a new type of flexible porous carbon nanofiber film modified with graphene and ultrafine polar TiO2 nanoparticles is designed as a sulfur host, in which the artful structure enabled the highly efficient dispersion of sulfur for a high capacity and a strong confinement capability of lithium polysulfides, resulting in prolonged cycle life. Thus, the cathode shows an extremely high initial specific discharge capacity of 1501 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and an excellent rate capability of 668 mA h g(-1) at 5 C as well as prolonged cycling stability. The artful design provides a facile method to fabricate high-performance, flexible sulfur cathodes for Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, challenges regarding the limited sulfur content and areal sulfur loading in the cathode lead to a low areal capacity that cannot even outperform state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, which greatly offsets the high-energy advantage of Li-S batteries and further hinders their practical use. Here, we theoretically indicated that the electronic conduction efficiency of the sulfur host nanomaterial plays a crucial role in determining the sulfur content, and a highly efficient single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) conductive network was constructed for our proof-of-concept studies, resulting in an unprecedentedly high sulfur content up to 95 wt%. The interwoven SWCNTs not only provide abundant paths for electron and lithium ion transport, but also facilitate polysulfides trapping during sulfur conversion reactions. As a result, a high areal capacity of 8.63 mA h cm(-2) was obtained with a high areal sulfur loading of 7.2 mg cm(-2), much higher than that of lithium-ion batteries (4 mA h cm(-2)). Our approach demonstrates a new design concept for the electrode materials of high-energy-density lithium-sulfur batteries and could possibly be extended to other electrochemical energy storage systems.

A two-dimensional nanostructured morphology with uniform ZnO nanoparticles (average diameter of 10 +/- 4 nm) anchored on NDG nanosheets was observed via electron microscopy. The polar heteroatoms on the graphene sheets provided abundant sites for polysulfide absorption. More importantly, the strong chemical interaction between ZnO and polysulfides efficiently hindered the transport of polysulfides. Consequently, the lithium/sulfur (Li/S) battery with the ZnO/NDG composite-coated separator exhibited enhanced performance in terms of discharge capacity and cycling stability compared to the cell with a conventional separator. With the modified separator, the Li/S battery achieved a discharge capacity of 942 mAh.g(-1) after the first cycle and exhibited a capacity retention of 90.02% after the 200th charge/discharge test at 0.1 C. These results indicate that suppression of the shuttling of polysulfides efficiently improves the performance of the Li/S battery.

However, the inherent disadvantages of poor electrical conductivity, polysulfide shuttle effects, and volume expansion seriously hinder their practical commercial applications. In this study, we have successfully designed a three-dimensional free-standing composite cathode with MoS2 nanosheets growing on the surface of porous graphitized carbon nanofiber. The combination of porous carbon and MoS2 nanosheets can accommodate more sulfur active material, and the graphitized carbon can significantly improve the electrical conductivity of the overall electrode. More importantly, the MoS2 can further adsorb the intermediate polysulfide, preventing the loss of sulfur active material. As a result, the dual-functional composite cathode exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 1385 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C. When long-cycled at 1.0C, the capacity can be maintained at 594 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles. When increasing the load of sulfur per unit area, the composite cathode electrodes continue to demonstrate excellent electrochemical performances. The results show that the dual-functional MoS2 Nanosheets/Graphitized Porous Carbon Nanofiber composite is an alternative cathode for future high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Although extensive research efforts have tackled poor cycling performance and self-discharge, battery stability has been improved at the expense of energy density. We have developed an interlayer consisting of two-layer chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown graphene supported by a conventional polypropylene (PP) separator. Unlike interlayers made of discrete nano-/microstructures that increase the thickness and weight of the separator, the CVD-graphene is an intact film with an area of 5 X 60 cm(2) and has a thickness of similar to 0.6 nm and areal density of similar to 0.15 mu g cm(-2), which are negligible to those of the PP separator. The CVD-graphene on PP separator is the thinnest and lightest interlayer to date and is able to suppress the shuttling of polysulfides and enhance the utilization of sulfur, leading to concurrently improved specific capacity, rate capability, and cycle stability and suppressed self-discharge when assembled with cathodes consisting of different sulfur/carbon composites and electrolytes either with or without LiNO3 additive.

Mesoporous TiO2 Nanocrystals/Graphene as an Efficient Sulfur Host Material for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						TiO2 nanocrystals; reduced graphene oxides; chemisorption; sulfur host material; lithium-sulfur battery	LI-S BATTERIES; CARBON NANOTUBES; CATHODE; ELECTRODE; COMPOSITE; NANOSTRUCTURE; POLYSULFIDES; MOLECULES; CAPACITY	Rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promisingin high-energy storage due to the large specific energy density of about 2600 W h kg(-1). However, the low conductivity of sulfur and discharge products as well as polysulfide-shuttle effect between the cathode and anode hamper applications of Li-S batteries. Herein, we describe a novel and efficient S host material consisting of mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs) fabricated in situ on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for Li-S batteries. The TiO2@rGO hybrid can be loaded with 72 wt % sulfur. The strong chemisorption ability of the TiO2 NCs toward polysulfide combined with high electrical conductivity of rGO effectively localize the soluble polysulfide species within the cathode and facilitate electron and Li ions transport to/from the cathode Materials. The sulfur-incorporated TiO2@rGO hybrid (S/TiO2@rGO) shows large capacities of 1116 and 917 mA h g(-1) at the current densities of 0.2 and 1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g-1) after 100 cycles, respectively. When the current density is increased 20 times from 0.2 to 4 C, 60% capacity is retained, thereby demonstrating good cycling stability and rate capability. The synergistic effects of TiO2 NCs, toward effective chemisorptiou of polysulfides and conductive rGO with high electron mobility make a promising application of S/TiO2@rGO hybrid in high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the lithium-sulfur batteries suffer from the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides, which induce parasitic reactions with lithium metal anodes. The safety of lithium-sulfur batteries is also concerned with the risk of dendrite growth on lithium metal anodes. To simultaneously address the challenges in the shuttle effect and safety problems, we demonstrate herein a two-dimensional vermiculite separator. With the assembly of the2D exfoliated vermiculite sheets, the vermiculite separator can suppress the diffusion of polysulfides across the separator through electrostatic interaction and steric hindrance. Meanwhile, the inorganic sheets with high strength and Young's modulus prevent the penetration of lithium metal dendrite and potentially improve the safety of the system. This work elucidates a promising strategy for safe and stable lithium sulfur batteries, and can also be extended to other electrochemical systems based on metal anodes.

Although the composites of carbonaceous materials and metal oxides as the hosts of sulfur have been applied to improve the performance, their structures usually collapsed due to huge volumetric expansion of sulfur. Therefore, interlayer reported as a novel cell configuration could efficiently restrict the shuttle effect of polysulfide. Here, we design a unique separator modified by a functional "polysulfide trapping net" which consists of intertwined TiO2 nanotubes and carbon nanotubes to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries. Benefiting from the network structure, there are abundant ion pathways, meanwhile, TiO2 nanotubes provide strong chemical and physical adsorption, carbon nanotubes serve as a conductive network which accelerates the transport of electrons. With the modified separator, the electrode exhibits an initial capacity of 936 mAh g(-1) at 1 C rate and maintains a stable cycling performance over 200 cycles.

However, the insulating nature and shuttling effect of sulfur severely limits their performance. The incorporation of sulfur with carbon materials has been deemed as one of the most powerful strategies to improve electrical conductivity and suppress soluble polysulfide shuttling. Herein, a novel three-dimensional carbon framework (3DCF) is prepared and employed as a sulfur host (3DCF@S) for Li-S batteries. The 3DCF not only supplies abundant paths for lithium ion diffusion and electron transport, but also strengthens polysulfide immobilization during the lithium/sulfur conversion reactions. As a result, the 3DCF@S with high sulfur content of 90% exhibits a high capacity of 1366 mA h/g at 0.1 C and excellent cycling stability with a satisfactory capacity of 601 mA h/g after 600 cycles at 2.0 C. The resultant Li-S button battery based 3DCF@S electrode could power a light-emitting diode for 2 h. The acquired 3DCF@S is expected to be widely used in Li-S batteries and this study will promote developments of carbon/sulfur composites for Li-S batteries.

But commercial applications are hampered by rapid capacity fading and low sulfur content. Herein, the composite of integrating manganese oxide on graphene was prepared by a facile redox reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and graphene in acidic aqueous solution to solve the problems of the Li-S batteries. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis show that sulfur was uniformity coated on G/MnO2 composite. TG indicated that the G/MnO2/S composites contained 76.56 wt% active sulfur. The prepared cathode of G/MnO2/S composites exhibited excellent rate performance and cycle stability. At a high rate of 1 C, its maximum discharge capacity reached 908 mA h g(-1) and its average capacity decreasing rate was only 0.105%/cycle when running over 500 cycles. The interaction mechanism of MnO2 with polysulfides was investigated by adsorption tests and XPS analysis. The excellent electrochemical performance might be due to a combination of adsorption or catalytic properties of MnO2, and the conductivity network of graphene.

However, the lithium-sulfur technology today is plagued with numerous challenges, including poor sulfur conductivity, large volumetric expansion, severe polysulfide shuttling and low sulfur utilization, which prevent its wide-spread adoption in the energy storage industry. Here we report a freestanding three-dimensional (3D) graphene framework for highly efficient loading of sulfur particles and creating a high capacity sulfur cathode. Using a one-pot synthesis method, we show a mechanically robust graphene-sulfur composite can be prepared with the highest sulfur weight content (90% sulfur) reported to date, and can be directly used as the sulfur cathode without additional binders or conductive additives. The graphene-sulfur composite features a highly interconnected graphene network ensuring excellent conductivity and a 3D porous structure allowing efficient ion transport and accommodating large volume expansion. Additionally, the 3D graphene framework can also function as an effective encapsulation layer to retard the polysulfide shuttling effect, thus enabling a highly robust sulfur cathode. Electrochemical studies show that such composite can deliver a highest capacity of 969 mAh.g(-1), a record high number achieved for all sulfur cathodes reported to date when normalized by the total mass of the entire electrode. Our studies demonstrate that the 3D graphene framework represents an attractive scaffold material for a high performance lithium sulfur battery cathode, and could enable exciting opportunities for ultra-high capacity energy storage applications.

Here, we introduce light-weight polar carbon selfdoping C3N4 nanosheets (C-CNN) as sulfur host for the fabrication of high performance Li-S batteries. The role of carbon doping in boosting the electrical conductivity of C-CNN is revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electrical conductivity measurements. The strong chemical interactions between C-CNN and polysulfides are investigated by adsorption and post-mortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Benefiting from the high surface area, enhanced electrical conductivity and high content of active N species (56.7 at%) in C-CNN, the strong chemical interactions between C-CNN and polysulfides can be fully exploited to minimize the shuttle effect and achieve long cycle life of Li-S batteries. As a result, the C-CNN/S cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 1050 mAhg(-1), good rate capability and excellent cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle at 1 C over 500 cycles, showing better performance than nitrogen-doped graphene. A performance comparison with the literature also shows that C-CNN is one of the most promising nitrogen-containing carbon materials for long cycle life Li-S batteries.

One of the solutions to mitigate the shuttle effect is the utilization of interlayers. Herein, graphene oxide (GO) paper as an interlayer has been implemented between the sulfur cathode fabricated by the vapor deposition process as a binder-free electrode and a separator in a Li-S battery in order to gain a sufficient capacity. The morphological characteristics and electrochemical performance of the fabricated electrode have been investigated. The fabricated battery demonstrates an initial discharge capacity of 1265.46 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 100 mA g(-1). The coulombic efficiency is obtained to be 88.49% after 40 cycles. The remained capacity for the battery is 44.70% after several cycles at different current densities. The existence of the GO interlayer improves the electrochemical properties of the battery compared to the one with a pure sulfur cathode. The obtained results indicate that after 40 cycles, the capacity retention is 2.1 times more than that of the battery without the GO implementation.

By studying the binding energies, adsorption structures, charge transfer and electronic properties, we find that these anchoring systems bind strongly with the lithium polysulfides and hence able to effectively reduce the shuttle effect. Especially the Au modified single vacancy graphene, with the strongest binding energy while retains the highly soluble lithium polysulfides intact, keeping the metallic state during the whole charge process, could be promising for applications in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Nevertheless, the industrial production of lithium sulfur battery is hindered by the insulation of sulfur and the shuttle behavior of soluble polysulfides. Herein, a freestanding Li-S battery cathode with a unique intercalated microstructure by penetrating graphene sheets into CoO/C polyhedrons is developed as an effective polysulfides reservoir (N-rGO@CoO/C). The unique intercalated microstructure offers continuous and rapid charge transport between the conductive matrix of N-rGO and CoO/C, effectively expediting the redox conversion of lithium polysulfides. Meanwhile, the 3D porous network provides accommodation for storing sulfur and adapts to large volume change. As a result, an impressive initial capacity of 1216 mA h g(-1) of the cell with N-rGO@CoO/C can be achieved when sulfur proportion and loading reach 72 wt% and 3.5 mg cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the derived Li-S battery possesses an outstanding areal capacity (10.0 mA h cm(-2)) and excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 7.47 mA h cm(-2) after 150 cycling) even with a very high sulfur loading (up to 9.6 mg cm(-2)). This study offers a feasible way for the development of self-supporting cathode and high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, a bifunctional separator was modified by Al2O3 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via a facile method. Li-S battery assembled with the modified separator shows excellent cycling stability (760.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles) and promising rate performance. The reason is ascribed to synergistic effect of CNTs and Al2O3 double coating layers, the strong physicochemical interaction between Al2O3 and the polysulfides could alleviate the shuttle effect, and the high conductivity of CNTs can facilitate the reaction kinetics of sulfur and its corresponding discharge products, respectively, which can improve the utilization ratio of sulfur. In addition, the double protection layers improve the hardness of the separator, as well as regulate Li+ ion deposition, which can effectively prevent the formation of lithium dendrites, thus the safety of the batteries are significant improved.

Meanwhile metal oxide and sulfide are usually used to modify the cathode performance due to the strong chemical interaction with sulfur. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) flower-like carbon assembly materials with FeS decorated are synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. Despite a lower specific surface area, 3D flower-like FeS/carbon assembly materials (FeS/C) show enhanced electrochemical properties than flower-like porous carbon used for lithium-sulfur batteries. Compared with the capacity retention (25.6%) of C-S electrode, the FeS/C-S electrode delivers obvious higher capacity retention of 66.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Moreover, the electrode shows higher capacity retention when current density is increased. Owing to the strong chemical interactions between FeS and sulfur or polysulfides, polysulfides dissolution is depressed during electrochemical process, causing an enhancement of sulfur utilization. Except as polysulfides anchor, FeS also acts as electrocatalytic active site to promote the conversions of intermediate polysulfides during electrode reactions, thus causing superior rate performance. This study reveals the roles of ferrous sulfide on improving Li-S battery properties, further enriching the research on Li-S battery cathode materials.

An effective encapsulator for Li-S battery is supposed to have enough void space for sulfur accommodation and alleviation of volume expansion. Moreover, an excellent electronic conductivity is also crucial for high sulfur utilization. Thus, we designed mesoporous nitrogen doped yolk-shell carbon (NYSC) spheres as novel sulfur encapsulators. This unique structure design greatly fulfills the synergistic effect of chemisorption and physisorption for polysulfides, specially at high sulfur loading. The inner mesoporous "yolk" acts as a sulfur reservoir to entrap polysulfide species. Meanwhile, the outer "shell" serves as a physical barrier to alleviate the dissolution of polysulfides. Additionally, the doped nitrogen atom in carbon lattice can modify the electron distribution, introduce more defects and active sites for the chemisorption of polysulfides, improve the reversibility of Li2S/polysulfide/Sconversion and the electronic conductivity, contributing to the enhanced electrochemical performance for Li-S batteries (a high specific capacity of 1329 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and an extended cycle life).

Herein, we propose a novel strategy for trapping lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by combining nitrogen-deficient graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4-x) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form a functional interlayer between the separator and sulfur cathode in Li-S batteries. The defect chemistry present in g-C3N4-x not only improves the chemical affinity toward polysulfides but also catalyzes the polysulfide reactions. Besides, the interwoven scaffold-like CNT network in the g-C3N4-x/CNT composite accelerates the process of electron transfer. Based on this synergistic effect, the cells with g-C3N4-x/CNT-modified separators showed a remarkable discharge capacity of 1128 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, and a reversible capacity of 774 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, indicating an efficient strategy toward high-performance modified separators.

After sulfur impregnation, the carbon/sulfur composite achieved a sulfur content of about 67 wt%. The C/S composite as the cathode of lithium sulfur batteries exhibited a discharge capacity of 1410 mAh/g and good capacity retention of 912 mAh/g at 0.1C. These outstanding results were attributed to the synergy effect of microporous carbon and natural doping nitrogen atoms.

Owing to the strong adsorption of AC and the electrostatic repulsion between the -OH and negatively charged polysulfide ions, the Li-S batteries demonstrated a high initial discharge capacity of 1,656 mAh g(-1) (approximately 99% utilization of sulfur) and the capacity can still remain at 830 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Moreover, when the rate was increased to 1 C, the batteries could also possess a discharge capacity of 1,143 mAh g(-1). The encouraging cycling stability make clear that this facile approach can successfully restrain the shuttle effect of polysulfides and make further progress to the practical application of Li-S batteries.

As promising candidates for various energy storage systems, hierarchical porous carbon/graphene materials have been intensively investigated over the past decades, while the favorable regulation of their hierarchical porosity remains a challenge. Herein, porous CaO serves as both the catalyst and template for a versatile chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hierarchical porous graphene. The gas atmosphere during CVD and nanostructure of adopted catalysts impact significantly on the graphitization degree and hierarchical porosity of resultant materials. The as-fabricated material exhibits abundant microsized in-plane vacancies, mesosized wrinkled pores, and macrosized strutted cavities, thereby contributing to a strong surface entrapment, short ion diffusion pathways, rapid mass transport, low interfacial resistance, and robust framework. It is demonstrated as a favorable scaffold for lithium-sulfur battery cathodes with superior rate capability, high coulombic efficiency, and excellent stability. A high capacity of 357 (656 ) is manifested at the current rate of 5.0 C, exhibiting a 74% retention of the capacity at 0.1 C. The first use of CaO-templated CVD growth of graphene reported herein opens up new perspectives on the effective fabrication of hierarchical porous graphene materials on metal oxide catalysts with promising applications in energy storage, catalysis, adsorption, drug delivery, and so on.

Recently, more attention have been paid on the mechanism study, trying to reveal and solve the major existing issues, furthermore, to guide and improve the design of new lithium sulfur cells with high performance. Here, a novel route is developed to synthesize light-weight and mechanically stable reduced graphene oxide (rGO) rGO/carbon monoliths for the application in lithium sulfur (Li/S) cells. This cathode material is characterized by a hierarchical pore structure with a BET surface area of 1029 m(2)/g. The monolithic material exhibits a remarkably low electrochemical overpotential during the cyclic charging and discharging. These electrochemical properties qualify this binder-free monolith to be used as model cathode material for a multidimensional operando analysis. This means a simultaneous performance of cyclic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray radiography, which in turn allows new insights into processes on the macroscopic length scale. First, it is observed that surplus electrolyte is soaked towards the circular hole lithium anode during discharging. The ring observed shrinks and expands periodically during serial charge and discharge processes at different C rates (0.1 C and 0.5 C). We assume a concentration gradient and properties change of electrolyte driven polysulfides diffusion as the underlying process for this observation. Second, sulfur dendrites in centimeter length were found, however, can disappear very quickly while discharge despite the insulating nature of sulfur. Third, another macroscopic mechanism is the occurrence of a reaction front in form of a ring of high X-ray transmittance that quickly propagates from the edge of the hole lithium anode to the center of the carbon monolith at the end of each discharge step (the maximum front movement speed is 0.8 mu m/s). This process is correlated with the results of the time-resolved EIS and it is assumed that a local increase in Li+ ion concentration in the electrolyte is involved to obtain the final discharge product Li2S.

However, the shuttling caused by the soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) formed by the reaction of Li and sulfur causes rapid capacity fade and low sulfur utilization, greatly hindering their practical use. The carbon materials can also be tailored to prevent LiPS shuttling because of their abundant porosity and controllable surface chemical properties, which are divided into four specific functions: confining, trapping, blocking, and breaking up. Confinement means physically confining the LiPSs in pores in the carbon while trapping refers to chemical adsorption on the carbon surface to restrict their diffusion and promote their transformation to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S. Blocking means placing a barrier in the cells to inhibit LiPS diffusion to the anode, while breaking up means decreasing the size of the sulfur moiety to increase its affinity with carbons.

However, thesulfur-carbon cathode suffers from the polysulfide dissolution duringcycling, and the severe shuttle effect limits the practical application ofLi-S batteries. In this work, a carbon material (XU76 carbon) derivedfrom industry-residual petroleum was synthesized with a simple and low-cost method. Nitrogen adsorption, small-angle neutron scattering(SANS), adsorption kinetics, and UV-vis spectroscopy results showthat the interconnected micromesopores in XU76 could act as areservoir and trap polysulfide intermediates efficiently. The XU76carbon with high surface area (similar to 1005 m2g-1), good electricconductivity, good ion transport, and optimized distribution ofinterconnected micromesopores is used as the sulfur host for trappingpolysulfide intermediates and advancing sulfur redox kinetics. The Li-S battery with the sulfur-XU76 carbon cathode gives aninitial discharge capacity of similar to 1200 mAh g-1in the initial cycle and reversible capacity of similar to 700 mAh g-1after 100 cycles at a C rateof 0.1 C while the Li-S battery with the sulfur-KB carbon cathode only delivers a discharge capacity of 400 mAh g-1after 100cycles. Also, a discharge capacity of 462 mAh g-1is obtained after 200 cycles at a high C rate (1 C). The detailed reactionmechanism of sulfur-carbon cathodes is systematically studied at high C rates usingoperandoRaman and SK-edge X-ray absorptionspectroscopy.

All-solid-state lithium sulfur batteries with highly reversible characteristics are developed using a three-dimensional carbon matrix framework structure for the sulfur cathode. Sulfur is introduced into a carbon replica framework with a pore size of 8-100 nm. The composite electrode structure provides high electronic conduction and allows high cathode utilization during the battery reaction. The capacity of cells using a LiAl alloy as the negative electrode and the thio-LISICON (lithium superionic conductor) electrolyte increases when the pore size of the carbon replica is decreased from 100 nm to less than 15 nm. The highest capacity is obtained for the carbon replica with a pore size of 8.6 nm and a wall thickness of 4.7 nm. An examination of the relationship between the charge-discharge capacity and the structure of carbon replicas with different pore sizes and wall thicknesses indicates that three-dimensional highly ordered mesoporous carbon with a small pore size is a promising electrode structure for lithium-sulfur all-solid-state batteries.

By adjusting CVD time, the thickness of graphene wall is tunable from few atomic layers to ten layers. Raman results prove a high crystalline of 3D-MPGF. Attributed to the low density and high quality, 3D-MPGF can be used as promising lightweight binder-free current collectors. The 3D-MPGF loaded with S of 2.5 mg cm(-2) exhibited an ultrahigh initial capacity of 844 mAh g(-1) (of electrode), and maintain at 400 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1C (167mA g(-1)). With increasing the loading of S, the electrodes present higher areal capacities. When the loading of S is 13 mg cm(-2), the areal capacity of 3D-MPGF/S reaches 5.9 mAh cm(-2) after 50 cycles at 0.1C. The use of 3D micron-porous graphene foam proves considerably enhanced gravimetric capacity densities (of overall electrode), which can be a direction not only for batteries but also for other energy storage devices.

The E. prolifera-derived carbon (EPC) possesses a multilevel micropore-mesopore structure and a certain amount of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing functional groups. In addition, the hierarchical porous carbon also possesses a high specific surface area of 3536.58 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 1.754 cm(3) g(-1). The carbon can thus be loaded with a high sulfur content (EPC/S, 74.8 wt%), making it a promising candidate for use as the cathode material in lithium-sulfur batteries. The EPC was characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, and other methods. The EPC/S cathode exhibited superior electrochemical performance; the first discharge capacity was as high as 1328 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C. Further, the capacity was 520 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C and 510 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 1 C.

It is shown that in the initial cycles (25 cycles) of charge-discharge cycling, electrochemically inactive lithium sulfide accumulates. The predominantly inactive lithium sulfide accumulates in the sulfur electrode. It is likely that lithium sulfide is deposited in the pores of the carbon material, blocks the pores and loses the ability to participate in the electrochemical reactions. On the surface of the lithium electrode, a surface layer containing lithium sulfide is formed during the cycling of the lithium-sulfur cells and is in equilibrium with the electrolyte system. It is found that lithium sulfide does not accumulate on the lithium electrode for at least 100 charge-discharge cycles.	[Kuzmina, E. V.; Karaseva, E. V.; Kolosnitsyn, D. V.; Sheina, L.

Nonetheless, fast capacity decay and low specific capacity still limit their practical implementation. Herein, we report a facile strategy to overcome these challenges by the design and fabrication of 3D porous reduced graphene oxide/ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets-S aerogel (rGM-SA) composites for Li-S batteries. By a simple solvothermal reaction process, nanosized S atoms are homogeneously decorated into the 3D scaffold formed by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and MnO2 nanosheets, which can form the homogeneous rGM-SA composites. In this porous network architecture, rGO serves as an electron and ion transfer pathway, a physical adsorption site for polysulfides, and provides structural stability. The ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets provide strong binding sites for trapping polysulfide intermediates. The 3D porous rGO/MnO2 architecture enables rapid ion transport and buffers volume expansion of sulfur during discharge. The rGM-SA composites can be directly used as lithium-sulfur battery cathodes without using binder and conductive additive. As a result of this multifunctional arrangement, the rGM-SA composites exhibit high and stable-specific capacities over 200 cycles and excellent high-rate performances.

However, the current widely used interlayers generally have the disadvantages of poor conductivity and complicated fabrication.

Additionally, the use of sulfur as active cathode material has the advantages of being inexpensive, environmentally benign, and naturally abundant. However, the insulating nature of sulfur, the fast capacity fading, and the short lifespan of Li-S batteries have been hampered their commercialization. In this paper, a functional mesoporous carbon-coated separator is presented for improving the overall performance of Li-S batteries. A straightforward coating modification of the commercial polypropylene separator allows the integration of a conductive mesoporous carbon layer which offers a physical place to localize dissolved polysulfide intermediates and retain them as active material within the cathode side. Despite the use of a simple sulfur-carbon black mixture as cathode, the Li-S cell with a mesoporous carbon-coated separator offers outstanding performance with an initial capacity of 1378 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, and high reversible capacity of 723 mAh g(-1), and degradation rate of only 0.081% per cycle, after 500 cycles at 0.5 C.

However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and its discharge product, and also the high dissolution of polysulfides restrict the Li-S battery practical applications. To improve their performances, in this work, we fabricate a novel free-standing, curled and partially reduced graphene oxide (CPrGO for short) network and combine it with sulfur to form a CPrGO-S composite as a cathode for Li-S battery. With sulfur content of 60 wt%, the free-standing CPrGO-S composite network delievers an initial capacity of 988.9 mAh.g(-1). After 200 cycles, it shows a stable capacity of 841.4 mAh.g(1) at 0.2 C, retaining about 85% of the initial value. The high electrochemical performance demonstrates that the CPrGO-S network has great potential applications in energy storage system. Such improved properties can be ascribed to the unique free-standing and continous CPrGO-S network which has high specific surface area and good electrical conductivity. In addition, oxygen-containing groups on the partially reduced graphene oxide are beneficial to preventing the polysulfides from dissolving into electrolyte and can mitigate the "shuttle effect".

However, the polysulfide dissolution and the sluggish redox reaction kinetics still hinder its practical applications. Herein, a 2D layered graphene micro-sheets, loaded with mesoporous MnOOH (GMs-MnOOH) as an energetic sulfur host for LSBs is reported. This sulfur host material works in two ways: anchoring sulfur and lithium polysulfides by nonpolar GMs and Lewis acidic Mn (III) center of porous structure MnOOH. As a result, with a sulfur content of 56 wt%, GMs-MnOOH/S cathodes present significantly improved rate performance and cycling stability. The GMs-MnOOH/S electrode delivered a specific capacity of 952 mAhg(-1) and 807 mAhg(-1) at 1C and 2C, respectively. This work provides a promising guidance to realize highly efficient hosts for Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading.

However, severe capacity fading and low conductivity of sulfur are significant challenges for its practical application. Here, we report a facile approach to prepare reduced graphene oxide nanoscroll embedded with well-dispersed sulfur (S/GNSC) through a one-pot oxidation of sulfide and reduction of graphene oxide followed by freeze-casting process to generate graphene nanoscroll. The S/GNSC takes the novel shape of reduced graphene oxide sheet spirally wrapped into one-dimensional tubular structure, which enhances electrochemical performance by acting as physical barrier to prevent polysulfide from dissolving and an effective network to promote electron and Li+ transport during reaction. Therefore, the S/GNSC composite with high sulfur loading of 76 wt% exhibits high initial capacity of 1295 mA h g(-1) and reversible capacity of 744 mA h g(-1) after the 100th cycle at 0.2 degrees C when it is used as a cathode material for lithium-sulfur battery, while the capacity of sulfur loaded on reduced graphene oxide sheet (S/rGO) is continuously fading to 510 mA h g(-1) after the 100th cycle due to the irreversible loss of polysulfide.

However, the low sulfur loading and large particles (usually in submicron dimension) in the cathode greatly offset its advantage in high energy density and lead to the instability of the cathode and rapid capacity decay. Herein, we introduce a one-step hydrothermal synthesis of three-dimensional porous graphene aerogels/sulfur nanocrystals to suppress the rapid fading of sulfur electrode. It is found that the hydrothermal temperature and viscosity of liquid sulfur have significant effects on particle size and loading mass of sulfur nanocrystals, graphitization degree of graphene and chemical bonding between sulfur and oxygen-containing groups of graphene. The hybrid could deliver a specific capacity of 716.2 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) and reversible capacity of 517.9 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). The performance we demonstrate herein suggests that Li-S battery may provide an opportunity for development of rechargeable battery systems. (C)) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it has come up short on delivering long cycle life mainly due to the formation of soluble polysulfides, which results in the loss of active material during redox processes. In this study, we prepared three different graphene oxide based carbon hosts - graphene oxide (GO), thermally reduced GO (t-rGO) and dopamine-assisted chemically reduced GO (c-rGO) - and investigated their physical and electrochemical properties as a sulfur cathode. We found significant absorbance of polysulfides on the c-rGO host, which provided stable discharge capacity of 601 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C for up to 300 cycles. This stable cycling behavior is further identified by in-situ UV-vis spectroscopy and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, confirming the minimization of polysulfide dissolution toward the electrolyte through the adsorption of polydopamine coating.

Moreover, to solve the insulating issue of HNT, conducting carbon was deposited on the surface of HNT through polydopamine (PDA) coating and pyrolysis. The electrical conductivity of HNT@C host was thus significantly enhanced. As a result, the cycling stability and rate capability of the sulfur cathode were improved. In addition, the effect of carbon content on the properties of HNT@C composites and the electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode were investigated. With carbon content of 3%, HNT@C hosted sulfur cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 922.7 mAh g(-1) at current rate of 0.1C. Also, the capacity still retained about 82% after 500 cycles at 1C and the corresponding capacity decay is as low as 0.036% per cycle. This work can not only extend the application of HNT clay in energy storage but also provide a low-cost and promising HNT@C host material for advanced Li-S batteries.

However, the gap between theoretical expectation and practical performance limits its wide implementation. Herein, we report a nitrogen-doped porous carbon derived from biomass pomelo peel as sulfur host material for Li-S batteries. The hierarchical porous architecture and the polar surface introduced by N-doping render a favorable combination of physical and chemical sulfur confinements as well as an expedite electron/ion transfer, thus contributing to a facilitated and stabilized sulfur electrochemistry. As a result, the corresponding sulfur composite electrodes exhibit an ultrahigh initial capacity of 1534.6 mAh g(-1), high coulombic efficiency over 98% upon 300 cycles, and decent rate capability up to 2 C. This work provides an economical and effective strategy for the fabrication of advanced carbonaceous sulfur host material as well as the significant improvement of Li-S battery performance.

The porous carbon can be used to load sulfur for application in lithium-sulfur batteries. The obtained SPPC-sulfur (SPPC-S) composite shows good rate capability and superior cycling stability. When tested at 1 C, 2 C, 3 C rates after 500th cycles, the discharge capacity of 443.3, 300, 199mA h g(-1), with the capacity retention of 81.1%, 84.4%, 62.7% can be achieved, respectively. Such excellent high-rate electrochemical performance can be attributed to the 3D network structure and the large specific surface area of SPPC, which can not only adsorb the soluble polysulphide intermediate product, but also alleviate the volume expansion effectively. Insights gained from this work would shed light on developing 3D-mesoporous carbon infiltrated with sulfur through a facile approach for high-rate stable lithium-sulfur batteries.

Current development is, however, hindered by some tenacious issues of the sulfur cathode: the low electrical conductivity and the dissolution of the polysulfide intermediate into the electrolyte during operation. This paper reports an advanced design using a TiO2 nanosheet host to trap polysulfides during battery operation and a reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) sheet matrix to provide additional electron conduction and pathways for electrolyte and Li+ ion diffusion. As expected, such hybrid materials exhibit high performance in Li-S batteries: they can deliver a high, reversible, specific capacity of 889 mAh g(-1) over 100 charge/discharge cycles at a rate of 0.5 C, validating polysulfide containment and electron-conductivity enhancement by the synergetic effect of the TiO2 and r-GO sheets.

In such case, phosphorus doped porous carbon spheres (P-C) material are designed and applied as both sulfur host material and separator modifier to mitigate the shuttling problem in Li-S batteries. The porous structure can physically intake polysulfides, and the same time, the phosphorus element can chemically interact with polysulfides. Based on the favourable combination of both physical adsorption and chemical anchoring, the assembled battery with as-prepared P-C materials acting as both sulfur host and separator modifier can achieve high utilization of active species and realize good cycling stability. Specifically, an initial capacity of 1430 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 650 mAh g(-1) at 5 C is achieved, with outstanding cyclability and negligible capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle at 2 C even for 1000 cycles.

The prepared carbon foam possesses 3D structure with oxygen-containing functional groups, highly specific surface area (1648.63 m(2) g(-1))and a centered pore size distribution, which is due to the rational chemically tailoring strategy. The obtained carbon foam/S composite delivers a 841.2 mA h g(-1) large reversible discharge capacity after 100 cycles at 0.5 C charge-discharge rate.

Waste office paper, which is consumed in large quantities annually, was used to make a free-standing paper-based carbon (FPC) substrate, which inherited fiber-like morphology. In addition, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets modified FPC (rGO@FPC) host was also prepared by a vacuum filtration method. After S impregnation, the FPC/S and rGO@FPC/S free-standing cathodes were employed in Li-S batteries. The rGO@FPC/S free-standing cathode exhibited extremely competitive electrochemical performance, including a reversible discharge capacity of 315 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 500 cycles. This is due to the uniform S distribution, which boosts the utilization ratio, and the significant blocking action for polysulfide ions, which prevents the redox shuttle effect.

Herein, we reported a novel well-designed hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon (HPNC) via a combination of salt template (ZnCl2) and hard template (SiO2) as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries. The low-melting ZnCl2 is boiled off and leaves behind micropores and small size mesopores during pyrolysis process, while the silica spheres are removed by acid leaching to generate interconnected 3D network of macropores. The HPNC-S electrode exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1355 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C =1675 mAh g(-1)), a high-rate capability of 623 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, and a small decay of 0.13% per cycle over 300 cycles at 0.2 C. This excellent rate capability and remarkable long-term cyclability of the HPNC-S electrode are attributed to its hierarchical porous structures for confining the soluble lithium polysulfide as well as the nitrogen doping for high absorbability of lithium polysulfide.

The graphene/S/SiO2 composite exhibits superior specific capacity and improved cycling stability owing to the combined contributions from both graphene and SiO2 when used as cathode materials for lithium/sulfur batteries. The graphene/S/SiO2 demonstrates a specific capacity of 696 mAh g(-1) after activated, which is considerably higher than the graphene/S and pure sulfur samples. In addition, the graphene/S/SiO2 and graphene/S composites demonstrate improved cycling stability and much higher coulombic efficiency than the pure sulfur sample owing to the successful prevention of polysulfides diffusion. Furthermore, both graphene/S/SiO2 and graphene/S composites show an activation step in first 30 cycles, which can be attributed to the gradually increased capacity from reduction of high-order polysulfides to low-order polysulfides.

However, sulfur-based cathodes have several shortcomings, including poor electrochemical activity and fast capacity attenuation. In this work, manganese dioxide (MnO2) and nitrogen doped porous graphene (pNGA) were introduced to the sulfur cathode to improve its electrochemical activity and prevent the rapid decay of capacity. The pNGA/MnO2 composite with a three-dimensional architecture was fabricated by steam etching of nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel and chemical deposition of MnO2 nanoparticles. In this structure, the nitrogen-doped porous graphene acts as a skeleton to form a conductive network. The MnO2 particles anchored on graphene sheets have a good interaction with polysulfides. The as-prepared pNGA/ MnO2@S cathode shows an excellent comprehensive electrochemical performance. The calculated specific capacities are 1144, 1007, 920, 852, and 762 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 2C respectively. In addition, the pNGA/MnO2@S cathode displays a good cycling performance: the specific capacity maintains at 887 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C over 100 cycles.

While the electrodes are composed of readily available materials, the processes that occur within the cell are complex, and the electrochemical performance of these batteries is very sensitive to a number of cell processing parameters. Herein, a simple electrochemical model will be used to predict, with quantitative agreement, the electrochemical properties of lithium-sulfur cathodes with varying carbon to sulfur ratios. The discharge capacity and the polarization were very similar for the lowest sulfur loadings, while above 23.2 wt% sulfur the gravimetric capacity dropped significantly, and there was an increase in the cell polarization. In addition, a transition in the electrode morphology, from well dispersed to aggregated sulfur at the surface, will be reflected in the change in a critical model parameter demonstrating the sensitivity and functionality of even this simple model in predicting complex behavior in the lithium-sulfur cells.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectra mapping show that sulfur nanocrystals with size of similar to 5 nm dispersed on graphene sheets homogeneously for the sample prepared by hydrothermal method (NanoS@G). While for the thermal mixed graphene-sulfur composite (S-G mixture), sulfur shows larger and uneven size (50 -200 nm). X-ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) reveals the strong chemical bonding between the sulfur nanocrystals and graphene. Comparing with the S-G mixture, the NanoS@G composite shows highly improved electrochemical performance as cathode for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. The NanoS@G composite delivers an initial capacity of 1400 mAh g(-1) with the sulfur utilization of 83.7% at a current density of 335 mA g(-1)The capacity keeps above 720 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles. The strong adherence of the sulfur nanocrystals on graphene immobilizes sulfur and polysulfides species and suppressed the "shuttle effect", resulting higher coulombic efficiency and better capacity retention. Electrochemical impedance also suggests that the strong bonding enabled rapid electronic/ionic transport and improved electrochemical kinetics, therefore good rate capability is obtained. These results demonstrate that the NanoS@G composite is a very promising candidate for high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the rapid capacity fading resulted from the shuttle effect obstructs their practical application. Herein, ultrathin dense double-walled carbon nanotube (DWCNT) membrane has been designed to impede the shuttle effect. The outer wall of DWCNT helps to keep the integrity and conductivity for its inner wall. The defects on DWCNT are less than those on multi-walled CNT (MWCNT), which helps DWNCT to stack and form dense membrane. The tiny areal density of 0.00477 mg cm(-2)of DWCNT membrane would not weaken the Li-S battery's energy density too much. The electrochemical tests suggested that the DWCNT membrane improved the cycling performance effectively. A possible reason was discussed. The cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) grown on the DWCNTs made the membrane further dense, which promoted the blocking effect on polysulfides.

Among all the solutions, separator coating is a compromise solution which can not only impede polysulfide shuttling but also suppress the Li dendrite growing. Herein, an amorphous-TiSx coating (ATSC) has been applied to the separator in the Li-S batteries. The TiSx works as a catalyst which could confine the polysulfides in the cathode side and facilitate the charge transfer process. In addition, the ATSC shows well conductivity which is well verified by the electrochemical analysis. Cycling performance of the Li-S cell reveals that the specific capacity of the cell with ATSC remains 1030 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C after 50 cycles even without LiNO3 in the electrolyte. The superior electrochemical performance proves that applying ATSC is a promising method to improve the electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries.

Herein, we develop a composite polysulfide mediator based on carbon nanotubes enwrapped by zinc sulfide (CNTs@ZnS) nanoparticles as multifunctional host materials for sulfur cathode. The ZnS nanoparticles is uniformed coating on the outside layer of functionalized carbon nanotubes. The unique structure of CNTs@ ZnS ensure the chemical adsorption on ZnS and fast electron transfer from ZnS to carbonnanotubes. The presence of ZnS efficiently alleviates the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates and hence offers a mean to further enhancing the reaction activity via sulfophilic property of ZnS and catalytically accelerate the conversion of polysulfides to insoluable Li2S. The high conductivity of carbon nanotubes results in rapid electron transfer. The CNTs@ZnS cathode offers an excellent specific capacity of similar to 1003 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C. Furthermore significant cycling performance at 0.2C with 3.1 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading for 500 cycles is observed with 0.05% capacitance decay per cycle. The results provide insights to develop high-performance Li-S batteries based on multifunctional host materials.

MXenes, novel two-dimensional materials with high conductivity, regulable interlayer spacing, and abundant functional groups, are widely applied in energy storage and conversion fields. In this work, a Ti3C2/carbon hybrid with expanded interlayer spacing is synthesized by one-step heat treatment in molten potassium hydroxide. The subsequent experiments indicate that the as-prepared Ti3C2/carbon hybrid can effectively regulate polysulfide redox conversion and has strong chemisorption interaction to polysulfides. Consequently, the Ti3C2/carbon-based sulfur cathode boosts the performance in working lithium-sulfur batteries, in terms of an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity (1668 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C), an excellent rate performance (520 mA h g(-1) at 5 C), and an outstanding capacity retention of 530 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C with a low capacity fade rate of 0.05% per cycle and stable Coulombic efficiency (nearly 99%). The above results indicate that this composite with high catalytic activity is a potential host material for further high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, rapid performance decay at high-sulfur-loading condition is emerged as one of the main obstacles restricting the practical application of Li-S batteries. Here we develop a facile electrospinning method for synthesizing the interconnected yolk-shell carbon nanospheres assembled fiber network to construct self-supporting sulfur cathodes. Benefiting from high surface area, nitrogen atom doping, and synergetic effect between yolk and shell, the yolk-shell carbon fiber network is a promising sulfur hosting material for high-sulfur-loading Li-S batteries. With 70 wt% and 4 mg cm(-2) of sulfur, the yolk-shell carbon fiber network derived self-supporting cathode exhibits a high capacity retention of 82.8% after 500 cycles at 1 C. In addition, the self-supporting cathode with 16 mg cm(-2) of sulfur delivers a stable areal capacity of 15.5 mAh cm(-2). This work provides a new strategy for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, we construct a high-performance Li2S-based composite cathode with the help of three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (3D-rGO) network and outer carbon coating. Typically, the Li2S@C particles are uniformly embedded into 3D-rGO to form a binder-free 3D-rGO-Li2S@C cathode by the combination of a liquid solution-evaporation coating and PVP (Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone) carbonization. The 3D-rGO-Li2S@C cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 856 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, superior cycling stability with a capacity of 388.4 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1C, corresponding to a low capacity fading rate. It is demonstrated that the outer conductive coating is effective and necessary for electrochemical enhancement of Li2S cathodes by improving electrical conductivity and prohibiting polysulfide from shuttling during cycling.

Unfortunately, the wide applications of lithium-sulfur batteries are hampered by several issues, such as the low electronic conductivity and slow redox kinetics, serious volumetric expansion and polysulfide "shuttle effect". To overcome these issues, in our work, we design and synthesize a composite sulfur host material of Co9S8 microspheres and N-doped carbon nanotubes, where the metallic sulfide Co9S8 with a good conductivity enables the immobilization of the polar lithium polysulfides owing to the strong polar chemisorptive capability, and the one dimensional N-doped carbon nanotubes can provide channels for fast electron and lithium-ion transport. As the lithium polysulfides are well confined, and the redox conversions are promoted, the Co9S8@N-CNTs/S-based lithium-sulfur battery possesses a superior energy storage performance, exhibiting a large specific capacity of 1233 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and an outstanding cyclic performance, with a low decay of 0.045% per cycle and a Coulombic efficiency of more than 99% after 1000 cycles.

Here, a carbon nanotube (CNT)/graphene (Gra)-S-Al3Ni2 cathode with 3D network structure is designed and prepared. The 3D network configuration and the Al in the Al3Ni2 provide an efficient channel for fast electron and ion transfer in the three dimensions, especially along the vertical direction of the cathode. The introduction of Ni in the Al3Ni2 is able to suppress the shuttle effect via accelerating reaction kinetics of lithium polysulfide species conversion reactions. The CNT/Gra-S-Al3Ni2 cathode exhibits ultrahigh cycle-ability at 1 C over 800 cycles, with a capacity degradation rate of 0.055% per cycle. Additionally, having high ASLs of 3.3 mg cm(-2), the electrode delivers a high reversible areal capacity of 2.05 mA h cm(-2) (622 mA h g(-1)) over 200 cycles at a higher current density of 2.76 mA cm(-2) with high capacity retention of 85.9%. The outstanding discharge performance indicates that the design offers a promising avenue to develop long-life cycle and high-sulfur-loading Li-S batteries.

Many studies have focused on improving areal sulfur loading by using carbonaceous current collectors. However, low sulfur utilization and polysulfide diffusion could be more severe. Herein, we introduce a reinforced current collector consisting of carbon felt (CF) decorated with carbon nanofibers (CNFs), prepared by using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The CF@CNFs skeleton shows a large specific surface area for well-dispersed active materials, highly conductive network with faster electronic/ionic transport, and a micro-/mesoporous structure for spatial confinement on polysulfides. As a result, the cells with CF@CNFs current collectors exhibit a high specific capacity, superior cycling stability, and a good rate capacity. This work will provide a promising choice for designing novel current collectors toward high-performance, high sulfur-loading Li-S batteries.

Lithium-sulfur battery is regarded as one of the most promising candidates of the next-generation rechargeable batteries, since the active substance sulfur is low cost and possesses high theoretical energy density of 2600 Wh.kg(-1). However, the practical applications of lithium-sulfur battery are hindered by a series of severe problems, which are caused by the insulative nature of sulfur and its discharge products, and the dissolution and shuttling of polysulfides. Carbonaceous materials are generally used as sulfur hosts to improve the conductivity of the cathode. Regrettably, due to the weak interaction between non-polar carbonaceous materials and polar polysulfides, the carbonaceous materials can inhibit polysulfides only by limited physical adsorption and restrictions, thus the dramatic capacity decline derived from the notorious "shuttling effect" remains insufficiently resolved. Introducing polar or chemical adsorption sites to carbonaceous materials by element doping, such as N, S, Co and B doping, can greatly enhance the adsorption capacity of carbonaceous materials to polysulfides, so as to sufficiently improve the cycling stability of the cell. Moreover, element doping may improve the electronic conductivity of carbonaceous materials by changing their electronic structure, thus effectively increasing the utilization ratio of the active materials. This article reviews the elements doping commonly applied in carbonaceous materials such as porous carbon, carbon nanotubes and graphene for lithium-sulfur batteries, wherein single-element doping, dual-element doping, and multi-element doping are introduced separately. The effects of different doping elements on performance of carbonaceous materials are analyzed. And the development direction of element-doped carbonaceous materials in lithium-sulfur batteries are prospected.

To understand the environmental sustainability performance of Li-S battery on future EVs, here a novel life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed for comprehensive environmental impact assessment of a Li-S battery pack using a graphene sulfur composite cathode and a lithium metal anode protected by a lithium-ion conductive layer, for actual EV applications. The Li-S battery pack is configured with a 61.3 kWh capacity to power a mid-size EV for 320 km range. The life cycle inventory model is developed with a hybrid approach, based on our lab-scale synthesis of the graphene sulfur composite, our lab fabrication of Li-S battery cell, and our industrial partner's battery production processes. The impacts of the Li-S battery are assessed using the ReCiPe method and benchmarked with those of a conventional Nickle-Cobalt-Manganese (NCMI-Graphite battery pack under the same driving distance per charge. The environmental impact assessment results illustrate that Li-S battery is more environmentally friendly than conventional NCM-Graphite battery, with 9%-90% lower impact. Finally, the improvement pathways for the Li-S battery to meet the USABC (U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium) targets are presented with the corresponding environmental impact changes.

Carbon-Based Hybrid Interlayer to Anchor the Shuttling of Polysulfides for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						mesoporous carbon; interlayer; glucose; silicates; DFT; lithium-sulfur battery	MOLECULAR-ORBITAL METHODS; BASIS-SETS; GRAPHENE; NITROGEN; LAYERS; BORON	The next-generation lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have been under intense research for the last two decades due to the problem of soluble polysulfides. This dissolution of polysulfides in electrolytes leads to the rapid fading of battery capacity, short cycle life, and self-discharge. To resolve these critical issues, we demonstrate a 3D interconnected network of micro-glass fiber (Mgf) coated with glucose-derived carbon as an interlayer (C_IL). The microscopic and structural characterization illustrates the mesoporous structure of the interlayer that traps the intermediate polysulfide. Also, it provides a conducting path to electrons, exhibiting enhanced electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. To examine the role of carbon, we have also used the pyrolyzed micro-glass fiber (Py_Mgf) as a separator. The Py_Mgf shows improved electrochemical performance over the conventional separator. C_IL, on the other hand, demonstrates a high discharge capacity of 1389 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1) (C/5) with an excellent Columbic efficiency of 90% over 100 cycles each. The improvement in the electrochemical performance is also evident from the density functional theory calculation, H-cell adsorption studies, and UV-vis spectra of collected samples from the H-cell at every interval of 3 h.

In recent years, the concept of "electrocatalysis" has been introduced into the field of Li-S batteries, and some transition metals have been proved to catalyze the electrochemical conversion reaction of sulfur species. In this study, carbon encapsulated nickel nanoparticles (Ni@C) with a specific surface area of 146 m(2)/g are shown to play a definitive electrocatalytic role for the sulfur cathode. With Ni@C incorporated, the Ni@C/G-S electrode achieved a better electrochemical performance than the G-S electrode. Moreover, the reversible capacity and cycle stability were further improved through chemical modifications of the carbon shell. The influence of doping with different elements on the Li-S battery performance was also investigated in detail. Higher specific capacities of 1229 mA.h/g, 927 mA.h/g, and 830 mA.h/g were achieved at 0.2 C, 0.5 C, and 1.0 C for the N-Ni@C-G/S electrode.

The obtained core-shell cathodes demonstrate significantly improved electrochemical performance (949 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C). The capacities are remain 785 mAh g(-1) over 80 cycles and high capacity retention of 76.9%.

Herein a nanosheet-like porous carbon (NSPC) with unique hierarchically porous structure and excellent electrical conductivity was synthesized as a host material of cathode, and highly-dispersed, electrochemically active CeO2 nanoparticles as well as sulfur was deposited onto NSPC subsequently through supercritical CO2-assisted processing to fabrticate CeO2 decorated porous carbon/sulfur (C/CeO2/S) composites. In testing Li-S batteries, the C/CeO2/S material shows an initial capacity of 1538 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, higher than that of C/S (1194 mAh g(-1)). The material also exhibits excellent cycling stability (similar to 729 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 300 cycles). The gas-like viscosity, diffusivity and surface tension of supercritical CO2, facilitate highly dispersed loading of CeO2 and sulfur on porous carbon with less agglomeration and more intimate contact with carbon to achieve higher conductivity and utilization efficiency.

In view of these problems, a large variety of carbonaceous materials have been employed to enhance the electronic conductivity of the cathode and/or sequester lithium polysulfides within conductive matrixes. Although they may exhibit impressive electrochemical performance, the fabrication of most carbon materials involves costly precursors and complicated procedures. Waste paper the main constituent of municipal waste is composed of carbohydrates, and can be an ideal precursor for carbon materials. Herein, carbon microfiber meshes (CMFMs) obtained by the pyrolysis of common filter paper in argon (A-CMFM) or ammonia (N-CMFM) were used to form sulfur cathodes. Compared with LSBs based on A-CMFM, those based on N-CMFM demonstrated higher specific capacity and better rate capability, with a capacity of 650 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and 550 rnA h g(-1) at 0.5 C. This was owing to the strong immobilization of lithium polysulfides resulting from the heteroatorn doping and hydrophilicity of N-CMFM. The results indicate that cellulose paper-derived carbon is a promising candidate for application in high-performance LSBs.

To solve the above problem, a simple and green method through high pressure steam is developed to prepare sulfur nanoparticles (<10 nm) on graphene (nano S/G) as high-performance cathode of Li-S batteries. Owing to the nanosize effect, the nano S/G based Li-S battery exhibits enhanced charge transfer kinetics, achieving a high reversible capacity of 639 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at the high rate of 5 C. More impressively, at an ultra-high rate of 10 C, the nano S/G based Li-S battery can still deliver a stable capacity of 527 mAh g? 1. It?s believed that this facile and environmental-friendly cathode preparation method for high-rate performance will boost the commercialization of Li-S batteries.

However, their practical applications are hampered by the notorious polysulfide shuttle effect, which leads to a series of problems including the loss of active materials and poor cycling efficiency. We herein develop a Ni nanoparticles embedded in silica (Ni/SiO2) nanosheet spheres, which are mixed with graphene, and then coated on the separator as a highly effective lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) blocking layer. The Ni/SiO2/Graphene-modified separator is able to anchor LiPSs through affinity towards LiPSs by silica and Ni atoms, and enable rapid conversion between LiPSs and Li2S2/Li2S by abundant Ni catalytic sites. The mesoporous hollow structure of the Ni/SiO2 nanosheet spheres also facilitates Li thorn diffusion. As a result, Li-S batteries with the Ni/SiO2/Graphene-modified separator achieve a stable cycling performance (specific capacity of 922 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, with the cyclic decay rate of 0.28%), coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%, and a high rate capability (782 mAh g(-1) at 2 C). Our work provides an effective strategy to build a multifunctional separator for highly stable Li-S batteries.

The effects of nitrogen, sulfur dual-doping on the structures and properties of the NSHPC/S composites are investigated in detail by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and charge/discharge tests. The results show that N, S dual-doping not only introduces strong chemical adsorption and provides more active sites but also significantly enhances the electronic conductivity and hydrophilic properties of hierarchical porous biomass-derived carbon, thereby significantly enhancing the utilization of sulfur and immobilizing the notorious polysulfide shuttle effect. Especially, the as-synthesized NSHPC-7/S exhibits high initial discharge capacity of 1204mAhg(-1) at 1.0C and large reversible capacity of 952mAhg(-1) after 300cycles at 0.5C with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.08% per cycle even at high sulfur content (85wt%) and high active material areal mass loading (2.8mgcm(-2)) for the application of high energy density Li-S batteries.

Subsequently, the as prepared MCPs-PAN nanofibers are employed as sulfur immobilizer for lithium-sulfur battery. Here, the S/MCPs-PAN multi composites integrate the advantage of sulfur/microporous carbon and sulfurized PAN. Specifically, with large pore volume, MCPs inside PAN nanofibers provide a sufficient sulfur loading. While PAN-based nanofibers offer a conductive path and matrix. Therefore, the electrochemical performance is significantly improved for the S/MCPs-PAN multicomposite with a suitable sulfur content in carbonate-based electrolyte. At the current density of 160 mA g(sulfur)(-1), the S/MPCPs-PAN composite delivers a large discharge capacity of 789.7 mAh g(composite)(-1), high Coulombic efficiency of about 100% except in the first cycle, and good capacity retention after 200 cycles. In particular, even at 4 C rate, the S/MCPs-PAN composite can still release the discharge capacity of 370 mAh g(composite)(-1). On the contrary, the formation of the thick SEI layer on the surface of nanofibers with a high sulfur content are observed, which is responsible for the quick capacity deterioration of the sulfur-based composite in carbonate based electrolyte. This design of the S/MCPs-PAN multicomposite is helpful for the fabrication of stable Li-S battery.

Here, we report a sulfur carbon composite by confining S into a graphene sandwiched in mesoporous carbon nanosheets with a two-dimensional ultrathin morphology, suitable mesopore size and large pore volume, and excellent electronic conductivity. Serving as cathode material for a Li-S battery, the elaborately designed S/C composite leads to "kinetically stable" transmissions of Li ions and electrons, triggering a stable electrochemistry and a record-breaking rate performance. In this way, the S/C composite has been proved a promising cathode material for high-rate Li-S batteries targeted at automobile storage.

Poromechanical effect in the lithium-sulfur battery cathode	EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery cathode; Precipitation induced volume expansion; Poromechanical effect; Microcrack formation	MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; POROUS-ELECTRODES; BINARY-MIXTURES; DISCHARGE; CELLS; TEMPERATURES; KINETICS; SOUND	In lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, during discharge, solid sulfur (S-8(s)) gets dissolved and undergoes successive reduction and finally precipitates as lithium sulfide (Li2S) in a typical carbon-based, porous cathode. Deposition of Li2S leads to 80% volume expansion compared to solid S-8(s). During the dissolution-precipitation process, the total volume change of the electrolyte in the pore space can be attributed to two factors: (a) precipitation/dissolution of the solid sulfur phase; and (b) the cathode microstructure shrinks or swells to accommodate the changes in the pore volume resulting from the electrolyte induced hydrostatic pressure. Current lithium-sulfur performance models neglect this contribution. In this work, a computational methodology has been developed to quantify the impact of precipitation induced volume change, pore morphology and confinement attributes in a Li-S cathode. Impact of volume expansion on cell voltage has also been analyzed using a performance model. It is found that the poromechanical interaction significantly affects the second voltage plateau. Cathode microstructures with relatively smaller pores tend to experience less volume expansion, for the same operating conditions. It has been found that non-uniform precipitation may lead to significant pore confinement, which has the potential to cause microcrack formation in the pore walls of a typical carbon-based cathode microstructure.

However, the intrinsic insulating nature of sulfur and the notorious polysulfide shuttle are the major obstacles, which hinder the commercial application of Li-S battery. Confining sulfur into conductive porous carbon matrices with designed polarized surfaces is regarded as a promising and effective strategy to overcome above issues. Herein, we propose to use microalgaes (Schizochytrium sp.) as low-cost, renewable carbon/nitrogen precursors and biological templates to synthesize N doped porous carbon microspheres (NPCMs). These rational designed NPCMs can not only render the sulfur-loaded NPCMs (NPCSMs) composites with high electronic conductivity and sulfur content, but also greatly suppress the diffusion of polysulfides by strongly physical and chemical adsorptions. As a result, NPCSMs cathode demonstrates a superior reversible capacity (1030.7 mA h g(-1)) and remarkable capacity retention (91%) at 0.1 A g(-1) after 100 cycles. Even at an extremely high current density of 5 A g(-1), NPCSMs still can deliver a satisfactory discharge capacity of 692.3 mAh g(-1). This work reveals a sustainable and effective biosynthetic strategy to fabricate N-doped porous carbon matrices for high performance sulfur cathode in Li-S battery, as well as offers a fascinating possibility to rationally design and synthesize novel carbon-based composites.

However, some problems have seriously hindered the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries. A simple one-step hydrothermal method has been applied to design nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (N-GA) with three different nitrogen sources. Subsequently, sulfur was encapsulated in N-GA by chemical deposition method to synthesize sulfur encapsulated in N-GA (N-GA/S) composites. Among them, the N-GA1/S composite with sulfur content reaching 75.5 wt% has a discharge specific capacity of 723.9 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.7 C, and the capacity retention rate is up to 87.4% while the coulombic efficiency still remains 98%. The outstanding electrochemical performance is owing to the good coating of sulfur by nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel, the improvement of the conductivity of the graphene skeleton by nitrogen doping, and the strong adsorption capacity of the doped nitrogen atom to lithium polysulfide. The graphene skeleton also helps to reduce the volume effect while charging and discharging. Furthermore, the proportion of pyridinic-N in N-GA1/S composites is higher than that in the two other composites, and it has a better adsorption capacity for lithium polysulfide.

However, the severe lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle effect and torpid redox kinetics hinder their practical application. To solve these issues, a flexible NiCo2S4-hollow carbon nanofibers (NiCo2S4@HCNF) electrocatalytic membrane for Li-S batteries interlayer is fabricated by combining coaxial electrospinning and hydrothermal methods. On the one hand, the conductive framework of HCNF with hollow structure can buffer more electrolytes, which provides fast electron transport pathways and shortens the diffusion distance of ions. On the other hand, the dense NiCo2S4 nanowires uniformly grow on the surface of the HCNF, which can adsorb and catalyze LiPSs conversion. Due to the structural advantage of the NiCo2S4@HCNF, the Li-S batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability (only 0.06% decay per cycle in 500 cycles at 1 ?C) and high specific capacity (607.6 mA h g(-1) at 3 C). This research illustrates that the NiCo2S4@HCNF composite has extensive application prospects in high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, lithium-sulfur batteries have limited cycle life and rate capability due to the dissolution of polysulfides and the extremely low electronic conductivity of sulfur. To solve these issues, various porous carbons including hollow carbon nano-spheres (HCNs) have been used for improving the conductivity. However, these methods still suffer from polysulfides dissolution/loss owing to their weak physical adsorption to polysulfides. Herein, we introduced a covalent grafting route to composite the HCNs and the vulcanized trithiocyanuric acid (TTCA). The composite exhibits a high loading of the vulcanized TTCA by the HCNs with high surface area and large pore volume, and covalent bonds to sulfur, effectively depressing the dissolution of polysulfides. The first discharge capacity of the composite reaches 1430 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 1227 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The MoS2/CNT interlayer is constructed by loading MoS2 nanosheets onto a cross-stacked CNT film. The CNT film with excellent conductivity and superior mechanical properties provides the Li-S batteries with a uniform conductive network, a supporting skeleton for the MoS2 nanosheets, as well as a physical barrier for the polysulfides. Moreover, chemical interactions and bonding between the MoS2 nanosheets and the polysulfides are evident. The electrode with the MoS2/CNT interlayer delivers an attractive specific capacity of 784 mA h g(-1) at a high capacity rate of 10 C. In addition, the electrode demonstrates a high initial capacity of 1237 mA h g(-1) and a capacity fade as low as -0.061% per cycle over 500 charge/discharge cycles at 0.2 C. The problem of self-discharge can also be suppressed with the introduction of the MoS2/CNT interlayer. The simple fabrication procedure, which is suitable for commercialization, and the outstanding electrochemical performance of the cells with the MoS2/CNT interlayer demonstrate a great potential for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

Adsorption Mechanisms of Lithium Polysulfides on Graphene-Based Interlayers in Lithium Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						Li-S battery; heteroatom-doped graphene; lithium polysulfides; shuttle effect; DFT calculation; VASP	INITIO MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; LI-S BATTERIES; DOPED GRAPHENE; FUNCTIONALIZED SEPARATORS; PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN; HYBRID; CATHODE; DESIGN	One of the most critical problems in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is the shuttle effect. The transfer of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) from the sulfur cathode to the lithium anode leads to a degradation in Li-S battery capacity and life cycles. Recent studies reveal that the carbon-based interlayer materials introduced between the cathode and anode can effectively improve the shuttle effect problem and increase the battery life cycles. In this work, different types of the N-doped, S-doped, and N,S-codoped graphene surfaces are investigated by theoretical calculations. We find that a strong interaction may exist between some of the heteroatom-doped graphene surfaces and lithium ions, and that the adsorption of LiPSs may proceed via one of the three mechanisms, the dissociative, the destructive, and the intact adsorptions. Detailed structural and electronic analyses indicate that the Li-trapped N,S-codoped graphene interlayers (NSG1 and NSG2) could efficiently reduce the shuttle effect through the intact adsorption mechanism. Our results provide a plausible explanation for the observed better performance of the N,S-codoped graphene interlayers in Li-S batteries.

The porous MoS2/rGO foam is prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Few-layered MoS2 nanosheets with mixed 1T and 2H phases are developed in situ on the basal plane of the reduced graphene oxide (rGO), forming a continuous 3D porous network. It is found that the porous MoS2/rGO foam shows synergistic effects of high conductivity, large surface area, strong polysulfide chemisorption and high catalytic activity, consequently resulting in enhanced rate performance and cycling capability of lithium-sulfur batteries. The cells constructed with the MoS2/rGO/S cathodes exhibit a high reversible capacity of 1100 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, an outstanding cycling stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.15% after 300 cycles at 1 C, and an excellent rate performance up to 620 mA h g(-1) at 2 C.

The bulk sulfur/carbon powder target is prepared to sputter sulfur and carbon atoms together onto Al foil to form a porous and reticular structure that overcomes the disadvantages of traditional technologies and improves the electrochemical properties of Li-S batteries. Li-S button cells are assembled using the developed cathode plates, and the electrochemical test results show that the 1st and 100th discharge specific capacities are 1240.8 and 926.2 mA.g(-1), respectively, which are much greater than the performance of Li-S battery made using traditional technologies.

We present here the design, modification, and investigation of a carbon nanofoam as the interlayer in a lithium-sulfur cell to enable its high-loading sulfur cathode to attain high electrochemical utilization, efficiency, and stability. The carbon-nanofoam interlayer features a porous and tortuous carbon network that accelerates the charge transfer while decelerating the polysulfide diffusion. The improved cell demonstrates a high electrochemical utilization of over 80% and an enhanced stability of 200 cycles. With such a high-performance cell configuration, we investigate how the battery chemistry is affected by an additional polysulfide-trapping MoS2 layer and an additional electron-transferring graphene layer on the interlayer.

However, the polysulfide shuttle and sluggish kinetics in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) chemistry lead to low sulfur utilization, large polarization and rapid capacity decay, posing a fatal threat to the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Herein, we etched zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) with Ni2+ to manufacture NiCo-LDH, which is used as a sulfur host material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Benefited from the closely packed nano-clusters and the hollow structure, the NiCo-LDH could not only inhibit the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) diffusion but also accelerate the redox reactions. Owing to these properties, the corresponding Li-S batteries exhibit a superior capacity (1540 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and high rate performance (485 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C). This work shows a promising way for layered double hydroxide as cathodes for Li-S batteries.

A trilayer carbon nanotube/Al2O3/polypropylene separator for lithium-sulfur batteries	IONICS			English	Article						Carbon nanotubes; Inorganic composite separator; Lithium-sulfur battery	CATHODE MATERIAL; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE	A trilayer carbon nanotube (CNT)/Al2O3/polypropylene (PP) separator is prepared by means of simple tape casting of Al2O3 and CNT layers onto a commercial PP separator, respectively. The electrochemical performance of the trilayer separator in the lithium-sulfur batteries is compared with those of the PP and the Al2O3/PP separator. The CNT/Al2O3/PP separator exhibits the best electrochemical performance, including the cycling performance and rate capability. The CNT component in the trilayer separator acts as a matrix for capturing the polysulfide species and suppressing the migration of polysulfides to the lithium anode side and also reduces the charge transfer resistance of sulfur cathodes significantly. Meanwhile, the Al2O3 layer in the trilayer separator not only has the advantages on thermal stability and electrolyte intake but also can provide the strong shield for CNT from penetrating the separator.

However, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and short cycle life have critically hindered their commercialization. Herein, a stepped porous heterostructured membrane of carbon-multilayer graphene (MG)@ Fe3C/Fe3N is developed by a facile phase inversion method and applied as a current collector to replace Al foil. The special heterostructured membrane with MG can further boost the charge/Li+ ion transfer speed while accommodating the volume expansion in the charge/discharge cycle. The shuttle effect of polysulfides is inhibited by the heterostructure phase of the Fe3C/Fe3N catalytic effect and chemisorption. This synergistic effect is confirmed by density function theory (DFT) calculations. As a result, the C-MG@Fe3C/Fe3N membranes delivers distinguished discharge capacity and cycling stability of 508.92 mAh g(-1) (693.47 mAh g(-1)) at a large discharge of current of 2 C (at 0.5 C) after 400 cycles (300 cycles) with only 0.36% capacity attenuation per cycle.

Here, we have designed a novel three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure of graphene hollow spheres (HGs) as the sulfur host. The 3D HGs were successfully prepared via a self-assembly method of wrapping graphene oxide (GO) on SiO2 spheres, and then followed by carbonization and etching of the SiO2. The impregnation of sulfur into the hollow graphene spheres lead to obtaining the HGs/S cathode, which reaches up a high sulfur loading of 90 wt% in the composite (72 wt % in the whole cathode). The HGs/S cathode material remains a high discharge capacity of 810 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C rate. Furthermore, it demonstrates a low capacity-decay rate of 0.083% per cycle after 600 cycles at 1C rate. Compared with pristine reduced graphene oxide/sulfur composites (RGO/S), the as-prepared 3D self assembled graphene hollow spheres FIGs/S exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performances in terms of high specific capacity, remarkable rate capability and excellent cycling stability. These synergistic effects are achieved by more effective 3D ion/electron transport pathways, and efficient confinement of polysulfide dissolution and shuttling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant impact of the electrolyte type on the accessible cathode porosity in the charged vs. discharged state was detected, providing important insights in the cells conversion mechanism and the role of polysulfide solubility. The main advantage of the method lies in the resolution of pore accessibility and size distributions. Thus, depending on the state of charge (SoC), the C-rate used for cycling as well as electrolyte properties (i.e. polysulfide solvation), significant differences in the redistribution of active sulfur species as well as pore blocking effects can be identified. This methodology might facilitate interpretation and further optimization to achieve long-term stable lithium-sulfur batteries.

Probing Sulfur Deposition onto Carbon Nanomaterials from Aqueous, Elemental Sulfur Sols for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; nucleation; hydrophobic sols; energy storage; graphene	LI-S BATTERIES; ENERGY DENSITY; FUNCTIONALIZED GRAPHENE; CATHODE MATERIALS; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; METAL; ANODE; ELECTRODES; CHEMISTRY	Sulfur cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries often rely on integrating sulfur with high surface area carbonaceous materials. Nanoscale mixing is typically achieved by a lengthy, high-temperature melt imbibition approach that employs carbon nanomaterials in an aggregated solid form. In this work, we present a simple strategy to coat carbon nanomaterials with sulfur in a costeffective, room-temperature process using inexpensive elemental sulfur. Our results are based on hydrophobic sulfur sols, which have rarely been examined for use in the preparation of sulfur cathodes. We study the deposition mechanism on different carbon materials and find that sulfur dissolves from the sol into the aqueous phase and coats the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by heterogeneous nucleation and growth, but that this mechanism is not favored for carbon materials such as Ketjen black (KB) and graphene oxide (GO), for which undesirable homogeneous nucleation of micron-sized, insulating sulfur crystals is observed. High loading (3-4 mg(sulfur)/cm(2)) rGO-based cathodes prepared using this approach achieve discharge capacities of 1300 mAh/g(sulfur) (similar to 4.8 mAh/cm(2)) at 0.1C and achieve capacities 7-fold higher than cells prepared via traditional melt imbibition approaches at higher rates of 0.8C and 1C. Cells prepared without the need for added binder or conductive additive achieve projected full cell energy densities of 468 Wh/kg at 0.1C when taking into account all inactive components and assuming no lithium metal degradation, indicating that the deposition of sulfur from hydrophobic sols onto carbon nanomaterials can serve as a simple, aqueous-based, one-step process to prepare high sulfur loading cathodes with high projected energy densities.

As the host material of the cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries, PNCA achieved a high sulfur loading up to 76.7 %, owing to the distribution of pyrrole nitrogen and the three-dimensional network structure. As a consequence, this composite cathode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance, including long-term cycling stability (1292.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C over 500 cycles and 540.5 mA h g(-1) at 1 C over 1000cycles) and excellent rate performance (1249.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, 1060 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C, 936.3 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, and 698 mA h g(-1) at 3 C remained). This study aims at providing new insights for the synthesis of highly reactive nitrogen-doped carbon materials and then further proposing a future viewpoint on the design and development of advanced host materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. Furthermore, the key mechanism of the pyrrole-doped nitrogen configuration in the catalytic conversion of polysulfides was revealed for the first time after being combined with DFT theoretical calculations.

Herein, a flexible nanofiber carbon paper was first fabricated from poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) nanofiber and carbon fiber (CF) as an effective interlayer for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. The nanofiber carbon paper processes abundant meso-/micropores and high heteroatom contents, which are beneficial for the inhibition of the shuttle effect of polysulfides through physical adsorption and chemical catalysis. Therefore, the electrochemical reaction kinetics are remarkably improved. The primary discharge capacity of cells with PPTA/CF carbon paper achieves 1373 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C with a 96.2% utilization rate of active materials. The specific reversible discharge capacity maintains 755 mA h g(-1) at 5 C, with a 99.7% coulomb efficiency. This flexible nanofiber carbon paper will have a promising application in high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, self-supporting graphene/acid-treated multi-walled carbon nanotube organic foam-supported sulfur (oGCTF@S) composites are fabricated by solvothermal reaction followed by electrochemical deposition. The oGCTF@S composites can provide high electronic conductivity and much void space for accommodating volume change of sulfur and confine dissolution of the polysulfides by physical adsorption. In addition, a novel quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte (QPE) of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (P(BA-co-PEGDA))/LiTFSI-DOL/DME is prepared to further suppress the polysulfides shuttle through chemical adsorption with oxygen-containing functional groups. The lithium-sulfur battery assembled by oGCTF@S composites cathode and QPE shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1033 mAh g(-1), and the capacity can retain 834 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C, which is much more stable than that with the commercial separator and liquid electrolyte (LE).

Herein, nitrogen and sulfur codoped carbon dots/reduced graphene oxide (N,S-CDs/ rGO) composites are facilely fabricated via hydrothermal and annealing treatment of a mixture of graphene oxide and egg-white without additional reactants. The egg-white, not only act as heteroatoms source, but also produce carbon dots. The as-prepared material possesses a porous architecture with N,S-codoping into both graphene and carbon dots. Benefiting from combined advantages of each constituent, such as superior electrical conductivity, abundant edges and doping sites, N,S-CDs/rGO cathodes (with 65 wt% and 76 wt% sulfur content) exhibits enhanced performances characterize by a higher rate capability and high sulfur utilization. For instance, N,S-CDs/rGO@S65 cathode exhibits a capacity of 1550 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C and still kept high capacities of 1038, 861.1 and 783.6 mAh g(-1) at 1, 3, and 5 C respectively. Even at an ultra high rate of 7 C, a capacity of 740.8 mAh g(-1) is sustained. Moreover the cathode retains 427.9 mAh g(-1) reversible capacity after 600 cycles at 5 C.

The crystalline structure of the formed carbon was characterized via X-Ray diffraction whilst Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to observe the morphology. The electronic conductivity was determined as a function of pressure and the COOH functional group were quantified via a titration. The mesoporous structure of the formed carbon network allows for good sulfur penetration which is translated by decent electrochemical performance both in terms of cycle life and rate capability. Carbons prepared from waste avocado shells and functionalized with HNO3 offer a good performance in terms of capacity retention (500 mAh/g of sulfur after 100 cycles). This favorable performance may be attributed to the role of functional COOH groups on the surface of the activated carbon. [GRAPHICS] .	[Fawaz, Wissam; Mosavati, Negar; Ng, K. Y.

However, the poor cycling performance and the low utilization of sulfur greatly hinder its practical applications. Here we report the improved performance of lithium sulfur batteries by coating Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets (where T stands for the surface termination, such as -O,-OH, and/or -F) on commercial "Celgard" membrane. In favor of the ultrathin two-dimensional structure, the Ti(3)c(2)T(x) MXene can form a uniform coating layer with a minimum mass loading of 0.1 mg cm(-2) and a thickness of only 522 nm. Owing to the improved electric conductivity and the effective trapping of polysulfides, the lithium-sulfur batteries with MXene-functionalized sepailtors exhibit superior performance including high specific capacities arid cycling stability.

Nevertheless, the LSB suffers from some inherent problems that impede its practical application. To circumvent these problems, we grow carbon-coated ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles on graphene (Fe3O4@C-G) as an effective sulfur host for LSB via a facile hydrothermal method followed by calcination. Highly conductive graphene is utilized to homogeneously deposit the carbon-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4@C), which enable rapid and steady long-distance electron transport. Moreover, the carbon coated particles of Fe3O4@C exhibit a developed micro-mesoporous structure, which not only provide space for sulfur loading to prepare a composite Sulfur/carbon-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles on graphene (S/Fe3O4@C-G) cathode, but also provide channels for the interaction between Fe3O4 and lithium polysulfides. Furthermore, a strong chemical affinity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles coated by micro-mesoporous carbon layers towards polysulfides can be strengthened through the polar-polar interaction. Owning these advantages, the S/Fe3O4@C-G composite cathode deliver a high initial capacity of 1425 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and maintain a capacity of 1102 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles.

Herein, for the first time, a free-standing sulfur host consisting of cobalt and nitrogen co-doped porous carbon nanocages supported by reduced graphene oxide (Co/N-PCN@rGO) is synthesized via a calcination of graphene-supported cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework precursor and, followed by etching treatment. After a melt infiltration process, the sulfur can be uniformly confined within the Co/N-PCN@rGO host (Co/N-PCN@ rGO@S). When employed as the free-standing cathode material for Li-S batteries, the achieved Co/N-PCN@ rGO@S not only shows an exceptional initial discharge capacity of 1290 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, but also keeps a capacity of 640 mA h g(-1) over 500 cycles at 1.0 C with a fading rate of only 0.066% per cycle. In addition, the high rate test also confirms its superior rate capability with a high capacity of 880 mA h g(-1) at 2 C. Such outstanding performance can be attributed to the synergism of the integrated conducive network, the favorable surface structures of carbon framework as well as its strong charge coupling with Co and N species, ensuring an enhanced electron transfer kinetics, increased sulfur utilization, and improved immobilization and catalytic ability towards polysulfide intermediates.

However, their practical implementations are hindered by severe capacity fading and low sulfur utilization, which are caused by polysulfide shuttling and the insulating nature of sulfur. Herein, sulfur-embedded porous multichannel carbon nanofibers coated with MnO2 nanosheets (CNFs@S/MnO2) are rationally designed and fabricated as cathode for lithium-sulfur battery. The high conductivity of porous multichannel carbon nanofibers facilitates the kinetics of electron and ion transport in the electrodes, and the porous structure encapsulates and sequesters sulfur in its interior void space to physically retard the dissolution of high-order polysulfides. Moreover, the MnO2 shell exhibits a combination of physical and chemical adsorption for high-order polysulfides, which could sequester polysulfides leaked from the carbon matrix after long-time charge/discharge cycles, resulting in enhanced cyclic stability. As a result, the electrode delivers a specific capacity of 1286 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and 728 mA h g(-1) at 3 C. And the capacity could remain 774 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1 C.

Instead of conventional graphene powder, three-dimensional rGO sponge (3D-rGO) is employed for the composite synthesis, resulting in a sulfur film directly in contact with the underlying graphene layer. This significantly improves the overall electrical conductivity, strategically addressing challenges of conventional composites of low sulfur utilization and dissolution of polysulfides. Additionally, the synthesis mechanism of 3D-GS is elucidated by XPS and DFT analyses, where replacement of hydroxyl group of 3D-rGO sponge by sulfur (S-8) is found to be thermodynamically favorable. As expected, 3D-GS demonstrates outstanding discharge capacity of 1080 mAh g(-1) at a 0.1C rate, and 86.2% capacity retention even after 500 cycles at a 1.0C rate.

However, even after three decades of intensive research, prolonged cycling can only be achieved when a large excess of electrolyte and lithium is used. Here, for the first time, a balanced and stable lithium sulfur fullcell is demonstrated with silicon-carbon as well as all-carbon anodes. More than 1000 cycles, a specific capacity up to 1470 mAh g(-1) (sulfur) (720 mAh g(-1) (cathode)), and a high coulombic efficiency of over 99% even with a low amount of electrolyte are achieved. The alternative anodes do not suffer from electrolyte depletion, which is found to be the main cause of cell failure when using metallic lithium anodes.

As a result, by utilizing pure sulfur as cathodes, the Li-S batteries assembled with PBC/GO interlayer can still exhibit a capacity of nearly 600 mAh.g(-1) at 3C and only 0.055% capacity decay per cycle can be observed over 200 cycles.

However, the "polysulfides shuttle" effect hampers its commercial application. Here, we use a kind of rice paper as a raw material to get inorganic oxides doping carbon felt by the facile carbonization method, and then modified by a simple coating process using poly (fluorenyl ether ketone) and Super P slurry. The special structure of the carbon felt derived from rice paper and its modified layer endow the final electronic conductive interlayer with inherent polysulfides absorbents and ion Coulombic repulsion functions, respectively, which show synergistic effect for trapping polysulfides. As an interlayer of Li-S batteries, the obtained carbon felt/poly (fluorenyl ether ketone)& Super P (CFSS) interlayer shows excellent electrochemical performance in improving specific capacity and decreasing polarization. The batteries with CFSS interlayer exhibit a high capacity of 837 mA h g(-1) at 2.0 C and a high initial capacity of 1073.4 mA h g(-1) and good capacity retention of 824.5 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. CFSS interlayer also shows excellent anti-self-discharge performance. Therefore, the simple and economical CFSS interlayer can be considered as a promising component for high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Facile sulfur loading techniques demonstrate a critical way to achieving high dispersions of sulfur in the host's matrix, improving conductivity and simultaneously decreasing the active mass loss from the cathode. Here we investigate the effect of sulfur loading methods on the electrochemical performance of porous carbon/sulfur composites containing approximately 70 wt% sulfur. Three different loading techniques are tested, including one-step molten sulfur impregnation (155 degrees C), two-step molten sulfur impregnation (155 degrees C + 300 degrees C) and a sulfur organic solution impregnation, in which the entire microporous volume of carbon is filled by sulfur. It is found that the simple sulfur organic solution impregnation method is the most effective in enhancing the electrochemical performance of the hierarchical porous carbon/sulfur composite cathode in the lithium-sulfur battery system, due to the weaker interaction occurring between the sulfur and microporous carbon. Our work demonstrates the impact of sulfur loading method on the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries, which offers new insights into the preparation technology of electrodes.

Investigations on partially reduced graphene oxide capped sulfur/polyaniline composite as positive electrode material for lithium-sulfur battery	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS			English	Article						lithium sulfur battery; graphene oxide; polyaniline	CATHODE MATERIAL; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; CARBON NANOTUBES; POLYANILINE; NANOCOMPOSITE; IMPROVEMENT; DIOXIDE	A ternary sulfur (S)/polyaniline (PAni)/partially reduced graphene oxide (prGO) composite material has been prepared via simple heat treatment. The combined effect of prGO/PAni performs multiple roles like serving as a conducting additive and as a porous adsorbing agent to prevent dissolution of polysulfide in the composite. The prepared material has been characterized for its structural and morphological studies using x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman analysis and Scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical measurements have been studied by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge analyses with the potential window of 1.5-3.0 V. The S/PAni/prGO composite cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 972 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C rate and it sustains 645 mAh g(-1) at 50th cycle. The improved electrochemical performance of S/PAni/prGO cathode in lithium sulfur battery is mainly attributed to the combined effect of partially reduced graphene oxide and polyaniline.

However, the achievable energy density in the reality is much lower than the theoretical value for the reason that the sulfur is easily lost from active substances to the electrolyte. The main purpose of the present study has been intended to relieve this loss of sulfur, in which the nitrogen-doped wrinkled graphene (NRGO) with nitrogen doping level of 7.63 wt% was thereby prepared by solvothermal method with urea as both nitrogen source and reducer. XPS reveals that pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N and graphitic-N were existed in NRGO and micro-nano cavities were shown in the SEM morphology. The nano-sulfur was in situ deposited on NRGO at low temperature to obtain nitrogen doped wrinkled graphene/sulfur composites (NRGO/S). The initial discharge capacity and columbic efficiency of NRGO/S composites are 1464.6 mA.h.g(-1) and 96.3%, respectively, presenting a high reversible capacity comparing to reduced graphene oxide/sulfur composites (RGO/S). This can be explained by the pyridinic-N and micro-nano cavities within the present study, which are acting as favorable adsorption sites for polysulfides. It thereafter facilitates to depress the soluble polysulfides diffusion and further promotes the cycle ability of Li-S batteries.

In this work, MoS2/rGO (reduced graphene oxide) was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and sulfur added by the melt diffusion method. The as-prepared MoS2/rGO has strong polysulfides entrapping, high conductivity, large surface area, and high catalytic activity, consequently resulting in enhanced rate performance and cycling capability of Li-S batteries. The coin cells were constructed with the MoS2/rGO/S cathode material, exhibit a high reversible capacity of nearly 1380 mAh/g at 0.1 C, outstanding cycling stability with a low capacity fading rate. Present work reveals that the hierarchal MoS2/rGO/S cathodes are potential candidate materials for future high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

The MPC was prepared from a high-temperature calcination procedure using the moss as the carbonaceous precursor. Using NaOH, the MPC was activated to give a mesoporous structure with a high specific surface area (1057.1 m(2)g(-1)) and large pore volume (0.72 cm(3)g(-1)). When it was used as the cathode material in lithium-sulfur batteries, the MPC material realized a sulfur loading and exhibited a remarkably improved electrochemical performance, i.e., a high discharge capacity of 1070 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. This activated MPC also worked well as a capacitive electrode in supercapacitors, demonstrating a high specific capacitance of 332 F g(-1) (scan rate of 1.0 A g(-1)) and a high capacity retention > 97% in a long-term cycle of 1000 charge/discharges. This work demonstrated a facile method for the utilization of activated waste biomass material for future clean energy applications.

Nevertheless, the application of lithium-sulfur battery is impeded by intrinsic polysulfide shuttle effect and poor electric conductivity of sulfur. To overcome these obstacles, hollow FePO4 spheres wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (FePO4@rGO) as efficient sulfur host material is synthesized. The hollow FePO4 spheres with large inner space are in favors of sulfur loading and buffer the volume expansion between S and discharge products (Li2S/Li2S2) during cycling process. Meanwhile, the hollow and polar FePO4 spheres afford synergy of physical confinement and chemical interaction to restrict polysulfides shuttle effect. Furthermore, the wrinkled rGO tightly-wrapped on the surface of FePO4 offers an interconnected conductive network. Profit from these merits, the FePO4@rGO as sulfur host manifests an impressive cycle stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.037% per cycle at 0.5 C upon 1000 cycles, suggesting its enormous potential for high-performance Li-S battery.

Although use of solid-state electrolytes can overcome these two challenges, it also brings new challenges by increasing the interface resistance and stress/strain. In this work, the interface resistance and stress/strain of sulfur cathodes are significantly reduced by conformal coating approximate to 2 nm sulfur (S) onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO).

At 60 degrees C, the all-solid-state Li-S cell demonstrates a similar electrochemical performance as in liquid organic electrolyte, with high rate capacities of 1525.6, 1384.5, 1336.3, 903.2, 502.6, and 204.7 mA h g(-1) at 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 C, respectively. It can maintain a high and reversible capacity of 830 mA h g(-1) at 1.0 C for 750 cycles. The uniform distribution of the rGO@ S nanocomposite in the Li10GeP2S12-AB matrix generates uniform volume changes during lithiation/delithiation, significantly reducing the stress/strain, thus extending the cycle life. Minimization of the stress/strain of solid cells is the key for a long cycle life of all-solid-state Li-S batteries.

However, one of their main challenges is the undesired shuttling of polysulfides, causing rapid capacity degradation. Herein, we report the first example of sulfiphilic VSe2 ultrafine nanocrystals immobilized on nitrogen-doped graphene to modify the battery separator for alleviating the shuttling problem. VSe2 nanocrystals provide numerous active sites for chemisorption of polysulfides as well as benefit the nucleation and growth of Li2S. Furthermore, the kinetic reactions are accelerated which is confirmed by higher exchange current density and higher lithium ion diffusion coefficient. And the first-principles calculations further show that the exposed sulfiphilic planes of VSe2 boost the redox of Li2S. When used as separators within the lithium sulfur batteries, the cell indicates greatly enhanced electrochemical performances with excellent long cycling stability and exceptional rate capability up to 8 C. Moreover, it delivers a higher areal capacity of 4.04 mAh.cm(-2) as well as superior cycling stability with sulfur areal loading up to 6.1 mg.cm(-2). The present strategy can encourage us in engineering novel multifunctional separators for energy-storage devices.

The particle sizes of the CNS ranged from 160 similar to 230 nm. The S/CNS composite was prepared by the solution-based processing technique. Homogenous mixing generated S/CNS composites in which the carbon materials successfully enfolded the sulfur particles; thus, the electrical conductivity of sulfur was improved. An electrical conductivity of 6.8 S m(-1) at 129 MPa and the highest discharge capacity of 672.6 mAh g(-1) for the initial cycle were achieved with S/CNS composite prepared with 0.5 M glucose followed by carbonization at 800 degrees C.

J	Li, TT; He, C; Zhang, WX				Li, Tongtong; He, Cheng; Zhang, Wenxue			Rational design of porous carbon allotropes as anchoring materials for lithium sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Anchoring material; Shuttle effect; Density functional theory	DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; R-GRAPHYNE; GRAPHENE; POLYSULFIDES; CATHODE; FIELD; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE; PHOSPHORENE; DIFFUSION	The shuttle effect seriously impedes the development and practical application of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. It is still a long-term challenge to find effective anchoring materials to hinder the shuttle effect of Li-S batteries. Using carbon allotrope as anchoring materials is an effective strategy to alleviate the shuttling effect. However, the influence factors of carbon allotrope on the adsorption performance of LIPSS at the atomic level are not clear, which limits the application of carbon allotrope in Li-S batteries. Herein, using first - principles simulations, a systematical calculation of carbon allotropes with various ring size (6 <= S <= 16) and shape is conducted to understand the adsorption mechanism. The results show that the T-G monolayers with suitable ring structure and high charge transfer can significantly enhance the interaction between the monolayer and LiPSs, allowing them to have high capacity and high coulombic efficiency. Further diffusion studies show that LiPSs on the T-G monolayer have the low diffusion barriers, which ensures the charging and discharging rate of batteries. Our studies could provide material design principles of carbon allotrope monolayers used as anchoring materials of the high performance Li-S batteries.

In this work, various morphologies (sphere, fiber, tube and layer) based carbon materials have been used for preparing the sulfur-carbon binary composites via melt diffusion method for lithium-sulfur battery application. The prepared binary composites have been characterized for its structural and morphological information using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and, Scanning and Transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical studies are characterized by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and cycle life after being assembled as lithium-sulfur cell. The S-prGO composite exhibits the initial discharge capacity of 893 mAh g(-1) and it sustains over 50 cycles (598 mAh g(-1)) at 0.1C, with low capacity fading rate when compared to the other composites studied. A remarkable electrochemical performance indicates that the sheet like morphology can accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur and the oxygen groups containing GO minimize the dissolution of lithium polysulfides.

However, the insulating properties of sulfur and high solubility of lithium polysulfides decrease the utilization of active materials by the battery resulting in poor cycling performance. Herein, we design a multifunctional carbon-nanotube paper/titanium-dioxide barrier which effectively reduces active material loss and suppresses the diffusion of lithium polysulfides to the anode, thereby improving the cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries. Using this barrier, an activated carbon/sulfur cathode with 70% sulfur content delivers stable cycling performance and high Coulombic efficiency (similar to 99%) over 250 cycles at a current rate of 0.5 C. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the carbon nanotube paper and titanium dioxide, involving the physical barrier, chemical adsorption from the binding formation of Ti-S and S-O, and other interactions unique to the titanium dioxide and sulfur species.

However, the severe polysulfide shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics in sulfur cathodes, as well as dendrite growth in lithium-metal anodes are great obstacles for their practical application. Herein, a two-in-one approach with superhierarchical cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (Co/N-PCNSs) as stable hosts for both elemental sulfur and metallic lithium to improve their performance simultaneously is reported. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that stable Co nanoparticles, elaborately encapsulated by N-doped graphitic carbon, can work synergistically with N heteroatoms to reserve the soluble polysulfides and promote the redox reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes. Moreover, the high-surface-area pore structure and the Co-enhanced lithiophilic N heteroatoms in Co/N-PCNSs can regulate metallic lithium plating and successfully suppress lithium dendrite growth in the anodes. As a result, a full lithium-sulfur cell constructed with Co/N-PCNSs as two-in-one hosts demonstrates excellent capacity retention with stable Coulombic efficiency.

Multiple polar functional groups in GQDs can provide more active absorption sites to significantly strengthen the chemical absorption with polysulfides, suppressing the 'shuttle effect'. In addition, the highly dispersed GQDs particles in the solution served as nucleation sites, the dissolved sulfur are reprecipitated around the GQDs, forming a dendritic interlaced network structure to prevent the aggregation of the sulfur, and further enhance the utilization of active substances. A high initial discharge capacity of 1125 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C has been obtained in the GQDs/S cell, which is much higher than the initial discharge capacity of 658 mA h g(-1) of GQDs/SR prepared by physical melting method. The superior performance of GQDs/S is attributed to the unique dendritic interlaced framework and multiple polar functional groups. The strong chemical effects between polar functional groups and polysulfides have been confirmed by the absorption experiment and DFT calculation. This work develops a new strategy in cathode material design for Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The synthesized carbon possesses high surface area of 2520.9 m(2) g(-1), large pore volume of 1.40 cm(3) g(-1), moderate nitrogen content, and hierarchical porous structure, which was used to prepare DFSC/S composite as cathode material in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The DFSC/S composite delivered a better discharge specific capacity of 473.9 mAh g(-1)after 500 cycles at 0.1 C, and the decay rate per cycle was 0.83%. Even at a higher rate of 0.5 C, the capacity retention of DFSC/S composite was 446.3 mAh g(-1)after 400 cycles. The superior performance of the DFSC/S composite was attributed to the highly porous structure, which not only can provide sufficient accommodation space, but also can improve the infiltration of electrolyte, facilitating rapid Li(+)ion transfer in Li-S batteries. The moderate nitrogen doping in carbon matrix can strengthen the chemical adsorption of polysulfides. Therefore, DFSC/S composite is a promising cathode material to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

However, due to the rapid decline of capacity and poor cycle and rate performance, the battery is far from ideal in practical commercial application. In recent years, remarkable results have been achieved in alleviating these problems through the research and development of battery devices, including cathode, anode, binder, diaphragm, electrolyte, and current collector. Judging from the articles published in recent years, there are many researches on current collector of lithium-sulfur battery, but there are few reviews. Therefore, in this paper, the latest progress of current collector in lithium-sulfur battery is systematically reviewed, including basic requirements of current collector for lithium-sulfur battery, carbon-based current collector, metal-based current collector, compound current collector. Finally, the future prospect of current collector in lithium-sulfur battery is discussed.

Although various 2D materials can be found in different fields, the open access of these materials has greatly hampered their practical applications, such as in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, where the soluble intermediates should be controlled. Here, we have developed a facile approach to prepare 2D ultrathin interconnected carbon fabrics (ICFs) with "bubble-like" morphology and abundant mesopores using a "blowing bubble" method. Serving as independent meso-sized rooms, nanosulfur dots can be stitched in 2D "bubble-like" ICF, which afford a short electron-/ion-transfer path and thus is beneficial to high reversible capacity. Encapsulated with reduced graphene oxide, a binder-free/free-standing cathode was constructed for advanced Li-S batteries. In addition, the specific energy of a pouch Li-S battery with this interconnected cathode can be achieved to 1.55 Ah@315.98 Wh/kg at 0.1 C. These results suggest that the design of "bubble-like" interconnected porous carbon fabrics and their integration with reduced graphene oxide provide a facile strategy to enhance the electrochemical activity of S and have the potential to be applied to other semiconductors or insulating materials for a wide range of applications.

We have developed a novel hybrid and dense separator coating that greatly improves the cycling and rate performance of the battery. The coating is fabricated by mono-dispersed Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) nanospheres uniformly embedded in graphene layers. In this hybrid dense coating, the LTO nanospheres have a high chemical affinity for polysulfides and an excellent ionic conductivity to produce highly efficient ionic conductive channels, while the graphene layers play twin roles as a physical barrier for polysulfides and an upper current collector. The unique hybridization guarantees a very dense coating that does not significantly add the volume of the battery and meanwhile achieves an ideal combination of an effective barrier for polysulfide diffusion with a fast ion transport. For a normal coating, a loose and very thick structure is needed to meet these requirements. Cells using a pure sulfur electrode with the dense coating separator show an ultra-high rate performance (709 mA hg(-1) at 2 C and 1408 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C) and an excellent cycling performance (697 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C with 85.7% capacity retention). The easy achieving of such excellent performance indicates the possibility of producing an industrially practical Li-S battery.

The initial discharge capacity of the batteries with the S/AC/SCNT and S/AC/SCNT-AC cathodes reached 1016 mAh g(-1) and 946 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, respectively. This result indicates that SCNTs play a major role given their excellent conductivity and insertion throughout the cathodes, which can provide an efficient charge transfer path for active materials. Moreover, the S/AC/SCNT-AC cathode exhibits long cycle stability with a capacity decay rate of only 0.11% per cycle at 0.5 C. Therefore, the introduction of SCNTs to a planar double-layer cathode is an efficient method for increasing the conductivity and bound polysulfide amount of Li-S batteries.

In this study, a hierarchical micro-mesoporous carbon (HPC) is designed and synthesized as a sulfur host from the cotton textile with KOH activation at 700 degrees C to combine the advantages of these two structures, where mesoporous structure can improve the infiltration of electrolyte to act as fast ionic channel and micropores have an excellent ability of binding sulfur. The HPC showed an excellent high specific surface area (2835.47 m(2) g(-1)) and a high pore volume (2.82 cm(3) g(-1)), and the ratio of the mesoporous reaches 57.85%. The sulfur in HPC/S was uniformly distributed in the host structure and no surface crystallization was observed by TEM characterization. Assembled in the lithium-sulfur battery, the cathode mixed with HPC/S and conductive agent delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1577 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, and a reversible capacity of 434.5 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at the current rate of 1C.

Here we report on a new sulfur electrode active material consisting of a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-modified sulfur-graphene oxide-carbon nanotube (S-GO-CTA-CNT) nanocomposite prepared by freeze-drying. We show the real-time formation of nanocrystalline lithium sulfide (Li2S) at the interface between the S-GO-CTA-CNT nanocomposite and the liquid electrolyte by in situ TEM observation of the reaction. The combination of GO and CNT helps to maintain the structural integrity of the S-GO-CTA-CNT nanocomposite during lithiation/delithiation. A high S loading (11.1 mgS/cm(2), 75% S) S-GO-CTA-CNT electrode was successfully prepared using a three-dimensional structured A1 foam as a substrate and showed good S utilization (1128 mAh/g S corresponding to 12.5 mAh/cm(2)), even with a very low electrolyte to sulfur weight ratio of 4. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the ionic liquid in the electrolyte improves the Coulombic efficiency and stabilizes the morphology of the Li metal anode.

The dissolution of polysulfide intermediates, however, results in severe shuttle effect and sluggish electrochemical kinetics. In this study, quinonoid imine is proposed to anchor polysulfides and to facilitate the formation of Li2S2/Li2S through the reversible chemical transition between protonated state (-NH+=) and deprotonated state (-N=). When serving as the sulfur host, the quinonoid imine-doped graphene affords a very tiny shuttle current of 2.60 x 10(-4) mA cm(-2), a rapid redox reaction of polysulfide, and therefore improved sulfur utilization and enhanced rate performance. A high areal specific capacity of 3.72 mAh cm(-2) is achieved at 5.50 mA cm(-2) on the quinonoid imine-doped graphene based electrode with a high sulfur loading of 3.3 mg cm(-2). This strategy sheds a new light on the organic redox mediators for reversible modulation of electrochemical reactions.

NiCo2O4 grows vertically on the surface of carbon fiber to form a three-dimensional network of nano-needle clusters, which provides more space for sulfur storage and effectively alleviates the volume expansion of sulfur electrode. Through adsorption experiments, it is proved that NiCo2O4@CC can effectively adsorb polysulfide, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect of polysulfide. Compared with CC/S (933 mAh.g(-1)), NiCo2O4@CC/S composite had better battery performance. The initial discharge specific capacity was as high as 1 467 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1C, and the initial discharge specific capacity was 1 098 mAh.g(-1) at 0.2C, the discharge specific capacity can remain 879 mAh.g(-1) even after 200 cycles, and the average decay rate of each cycle was 0.09%, showing good cycle performance.

Lithium sulfur batteries have been considered as the promising candidates of high-energy rechargeable batteries due to the high theoretical energy density and cost-efficiency. However, their practical application has been hampered by rapid capacity fading during cycling. In this work, one-dimensional reduced graphene oxide/sulfur nanoscrolls show promise for uniformly confining elemental sulfur in their internal cavities and absorbing polysulfide intermediates. The remarkable electrochemical performance of the reduced graphene oxide/sulfur nanoscroll materials is mainly attributed to the desirable structural features, where sulfur is encapsulated into the RGO nanoscrolls and kept close contact with RGO. The RGO nanoscrolls not only provide the electron transport pathway, but effectively alleviate the dissolution and shuttling of the polysulfides during cycling for lithium sulfur batteries.

J	Zhang, SS; Foster, D; Read, J				Zhang, Sheng S.; Foster, Donald; Read, Jeffrey			A high energy density lithium/sulfur-oxygen hybrid battery	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium/sulfur battery; Lithium/air battery; Lithium/sulfur-oxygen hybrid battery; Polysulfide; Air electrode	SULFUR BATTERY; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; CATHODE; DISCHARGE; ELECTROLYTES; CELLS	In this paper we introduce a lithium/sulfur-oxygen (Li/S-O-2) hybrid cell that is able to operate either in an air or in an environment without air. In the cell, the cathode is a sulfur-carbon composite electrode containing appropriate amount of sulfur. In the air, the cathode first functions as an air electrode that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen into lithium peroxide (Li2O2). Upon the end of oxygen reduction, sulfur starts to discharge like a normal Li/S cell, In the absence of oxygen or air, sulfur alone serves as the active cathode material. That is, sulfur is first reduced to form a soluble polysulfide (Li2Sx, x >= 4) that subsequently discharges into Li2S through a series of disproportionations and reductions. In general, the Li/S-O-2 hybrid cell presents two distinct discharge voltage plateaus, i.e., one at similar to 2.7 V attributing to the reduction of oxygen and the other one at similar to 2.3 V attributing to the reduction of sulfur. Since the final discharge products of oxygen and sulfur are insoluble in the organic electrolyte, it is shown that the overall specific capacity of Li/S-O-2 hybrid cell is determined by the carbon composite electrode, and that the specific capacity varies with the discharge current rate and electrode composition. In this work, we show that a composite electrode composed by weight of 70% M-30 activated carbon, 22% sulfur and 8% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has a specific capacity of 857 mAh g(-1) vs. M-30 activated carbon at 0.2 mA cm(-2) in comparison with 650 mAh g(-1) of the control electrode consisting of 92% M-30 and 8% PTFE. In addition, the self-discharge of the Li/S-O-2 hybrid cell is expected to be substantially lower when compared with the Li/S cell since oxygen can easily oxidize the soluble polysulfide into insoluble sulfur.

Lithium-sulfur battery with higher theoretical specific capacity and lower cost is regarded as a promising successor to lithium-ion battery. However, lithium-sulfur battery's polysulfide shuttling and lithium degradation have hindered its practical applications. In this study, cellulose fibers (CFs) were extracted from recycled paper hardboards by a simple alkaline treatment and then coated onto polypropylene separators by vacuum filtration. When being used as lithium-sulfur battery separators, the negatively charged functional groups on the CFs repelled polysulfide ions and redistributed lithium ions, enabling the assembled cells' superior stability and long life span. The lithium-sulfur battery with the recycle paper CF-coated separator exhibited a life span of over 800 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 71.69% and nearly no capacity decay after the initial formation cycles. The finding demonstrates that renewably produced, CF-coated polypropylene separators can simultaneously reduce the shuttle effect and degradation of lithium, paving the way toward commercially -viable and environmentally friendly lithium-sulfur batteries.

Reasonably designing the structure of carbon host plays the key role to alleviate the shuttle effect of polysulfide and improve specific capacity and cycle stability of Li-S batteries. Herein, a free-standing host consists of porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) has been prepared by electrospinning technology using zinc acetate as pore-forming agent, which was directly applied as cathode material for Li-S battery after sulfur encapsuled (47.8 wt% sulfur content). The obtained sulfur cathode exhibits charge and discharge capacities of 744 and 726 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) after 150 cycles and possesses a low capacity decay rate (0.09%) during each cycle. The good electrochemical properties of sulfur cathode can be ascribed to the presence of PCNFs free-standing substrate, which offers abundant pores to accommodate sulfur and inhibits the shuttle effect of polysulfide.

However, the systemic issues of Li-S batteries, such as the polysulfide shuttling effect and low Coulombic efficiency, hinder the practical use in commercial rechargeable batteries. The introduction of a conductive interlayer between the sulfur cathode and separator is a promising approach that has shown the dramatic improvements in Li-S batteries. The previous interlayer work mainly focused on the physical confinement of polysulfides within the cathode part, without considering the further entrapment of the dissolved polysulfides. Here, we designed an ultrathin poly(acrylic acid) coated single-walled carbon nanotube (PAA-SWNT) film as a synergic functional interlayer to address the issues mentioned above. The designed interlayer not only lowers the charge transfer resistance by the support of the upper current collector but also localizes the dissolved polysulfides within the cathode part by the aid of a physical blocking and chemical bonding. With the synergic combination of PAA and SWNT, the sulfur cathode with a PAA-SWNT interlayer maintained higher capacity retention over 200 cycles and achieved better rate retention than the sulfur cathode with a SWNT interlayer. The proposed approach of combining a functional polymer and conductive support material can provide an optimiztic strategy to overcome the fundamental challenges underlying in Li-S batteries.

However, there remain several challenges that hinder their practical application, mainly coming from intermediate polysulfide dissolution and shuttling. Herein, we prepared NiCo2S4 nanoparticles grown on graphene as the sulfur host for high-performance Li-S batteries. Such nanosheet composite made of interconnected graphene can offer abundant space to carry the large amount of S, convenient pathways for both rapid Li+ and electrons transfer, and extra reversible capacity contribution. Particularly, each individual NiCo2S4 nanoparticle is polarized synergistically, thus preventing the amassment of soluble polysulfides benefiting from polar-polar interaction and improving sulfur utilization. As a result, the S@NiCo2S4/N-GO composite exhibits a stable capacity of 1199.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles with capacity retention of 99.04%. Our work may offer a great potential in rational design of superior cathodes for the practical Li-S battery systems.

Herein, we demonstrate a composite host to circumvent these problems by confining sub-nanometric manganous oxide clusters (MOCs) in nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets. The atomic structure of MOCs is well-characterized and optimized via the extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Benefiting from the unique design, the assembled Li-S battery displays remarkable electrochemical performances including a high reversible capacity (990 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1)) and a superior cycle life (60% retention over 250 cycles at 2 A g(-1)). Both the experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrate that the well-dispersed MOCs could significantly promote the chemisorption of LiPs, thus greatly improving the capacity and rate performance.

To meet the requirements for practical use, it is necessary to develop an effective method to realize Li-S batteries with high sulfur utilization and cycle stability. Here, a strategy to construct heterostructure composites as cathodes for high performance Li-S batteries is presented. Taking the SnS2/SnO2 couple as an example, SnS2/SnO2 nanosheet heterostructures on carbon nanofibers (CNFs), named C@SnS2/SnO2, were designed and synthesized. Considering the electrochemical performance of SnS2/SnO2 heterostructures, it is interesting to note that the existence of heterointerfaces could efficiently improve lithium ion diffusion rate so as to accelerate the redox reaction significantly, thus leading to the enhanced sulfur utilization and more excellent rate performance. Benefiting from the unique structure and heterointerfaces of C@SnS2/SnO2 materials, the battery exhibited excellent cyclic stability and high sulfur utilization. This work may provide a powerful strategy for guiding the design of sulfur hosts from selecting the material composition to constructing of microstructure.

The TiN nanoparticles decorated on graphene sheets attract Li polysulfides (LiPSx) and catalyze the electrochemical reduction and oxidation of LiPSx in the discharge and charge processes, respectively. These two effects effectively restrain the dissolution of the UPS, and accelerate the electrochemical reactions, thereby, alleviating the shuttle effect. As a result, the cathode composed of TiN@NG/S delivers a remarkable reversible capacity (1390 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C) and excellent cycling performance (730 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles). We believe that this work can bring some inspiration for designing high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The uniform pore-structure of PGF enables high-temperature Ar plasma around 1536 K under microwave irradiation, which leads to super heating/cooling rate of >13700 K s(-1) forming Mn3O4 nanocrystals in 1.2 s. Interconnected PGF layers deposited with the Mn3O4 crystals around 8 nm in diameters can effectively promote the electron transport and anchoring/catalyzing the polysulfides conversion. The cathode exhibits a good capacity fading of 0.092% per cycle over 300 discharge/charge cycles at 0.2 C, indicating good reversibility. The high Mn3O4/graphene ratio and small particle size of the nanocomposite are hard to achieve by other methods within this short period. The instant and low-cost synthesis method is readily scalable and may provide a promising direction for the practical manufacturing of high-performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a mesoporous carbon nanofiber (MCNF) with graphitic pore wall prepared by an easy self-template strategy was designed to encapsulate sulfur and polysulfides in the carbon framework. The one-dimensional MCNF with graphitic pore wall can provide an effective conductive network for sulfur and polysulfides during cycling. The small mesopore of MCNF can also restrain the diffusion of long-chain polysulfides. Furthermore, MNCF with high volume can encapsulate a relatively high amount of sulfur and provide internal void space to accommodate volume expansion during discharge. The resulting MCNF-sulfur nanocomposite shows high and stable specific capacities of 820 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles at a rate of 0.8 A.g(-1).

However, the notorious shuttle effect results in poor electrochemical performance, which is a serious obstacle for their practical application. The delicate design of sulfur hosts is a very important strategy to suppress the shuttle effect. Herein, MXene nanoflakes confined within multichannel carbon nanofibers (MXene@MCNF) have been successfully synthesized as robust electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries based on a simple electrospun method followed by a carbonization process. This unique structure effectively prevents the restacking of MXene nanoflakes, which is conducive to improve the electrocatalytic activity of MXene for propelling the redox reaction of polysulfides owing to the abundant exposure of surface active sites. Moreover, the multichannel hollow structure can inhibit the outward dissolution of polysulfides via the physical confinement caused by their abundant pore structures and alleviate the huge volume change of sulfur cathode. Benefiting from these aforementioned advantages, MXene@MCNF-sulfur (MXene@MCNF-S) cathode delivers a high capacity of 1177 mA h/g at 0.2 C and excellent cycling stability after 200 cycles at 2.0 C.

However, the dissolution of polysulfides to electrolyte and consequent "shuttle effect" still hinder the application of Li-S battery. Here, a polyethylenimine/fish-scale based porous carbon composite (PFPC) with abundant active sites and a relatively compact morphology is prepared by wet impregnation method. Modified separator with the PFPC coating significantly improves the rate capability and cycle stability of Li-S battery. The Li-S battery with the PFPC separator shows a reversible capacity of 638 mAh g(-1) after stably cycling for 400 cycles at 1.0 C (1.0 C = 1675mA g(-1)) with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.030% per cycle. The improved electrochemical performance of Li-S battery can be attributed to the synergistic effect of physical blocking and chemical adsorption of PFPC for polysulfides and the fast electron conduction between adsorbed polysulfides and conductive network. Moreover, the PFPC separator is ultralight with a mass loading of about 0.04 mg cm(-2). The good electrochemical performance, facile preparation method and light weight make the PFPC separator promising for the Li-S battery application. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, their further commercial application is hindered because infusing sulfur into hollow hosts is hard to control and the interactions between high loading sulfur and electrolyte are poor. Herein, we designed hierarchical porous hollow carbon nanospheres with radially inwardly aligned supporting ribs to mitigate these problems. Such a structure could aid the sulfur infusion and maximize sulfur utilization owing to the well-ordered pore channels. This highly organized internal carbon skeleton can also enhance the electronic conductivity. The hollow carbon nanospheres with further nitrogen-doping as the sulfur host material exhibit good capacity and excellent cycling performance (0.044 % capacity degradation per each cycle for 1000 cycles).

However, the practical use of Li-S batteries is hindered by poor cycle life and low Coulombic efficiency, which are induced by shuttle effect. Modifying the properties of a separator is an effective way to inhibit the shuttle effect. However, only physical interactions of common carbon materials are not enough to confine lithium polysulfides. In this paper, a porous carbon nanowire (N-PCNW) is designed to modify the separator. The N-PCNW with high N-doped level (7.12 wt%) not only possesses excellent electron conductivity, but also traps the soluble polysulfides effectively with both physical and chemical interactions. With the N-PCNW modified separator, the pure sulfur cathode exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance, showing a high initial discharge capacity of 1430 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C (1 C = 1675 mA h g(-1)) and good long-term cycling stability at 0.5 C with 0.08% capacity fading per cycle. This design is easy and efficient, providing a great promise for the pratical use of Li-S batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The obtained porous carbon possesses abundant micropores and mesopores, which can effectively increase the sulfur loading. The composite exhibited a remarkable initial capacity of 1185 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and maintained at 488 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, when employed for lithium-sulfur batteries. Moreover, the composite displayed enhanced rate capabilities of 1124, 914 and 572 mAh g(-1) at 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 A g(-1).

However, it suffers from low sulfur utilization, fast capacity decay, and the notorious "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) due to the sluggish reaction kinetics, which severely restrict its practical applications. Using the electrocatalyst can accelerate the redox reactions between sulfur, LiPSs and Li2S and suppress the shuttling of LiPSs, and thus, it is a promising strategy to solve the above problems, enabling the battery with high energy density and long cycling stability. In this personal account, we discuss the catalyst design for lithium-sulfur batteries according to the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and sulfur evolution reaction (SER) in the discharging and charging processes. The catalytic effects for each step in SRR and SER are highlighted and the homogenous catalysts, the selective catalysts, and the bidirectional catalysts are discussed, which can help guide the rational design of the catalysts and practical applications of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfide intermediates induce undesirable shuttle effect and passivate separator/electrode interfaces. Herein we reported a facile, scalable, and green process to fabricate porous graphene (PG) modified separators for commercially viable lithium-sulfur batteries. PG, in combination with an amphiphilic polymer binder, rendered the engineered functional layer with extraordinary electrical conductivity, high surface area, large pore volume, and appropriate strength of chemisorption to polysulfides. Therefore, lithium-sulfur cells with sulfur loading of 1.8-2.0 mg cm(-2) and PG separators exhibited a very high sulfur utilization of 86.5% (vs. 55.6% on cell with routine separators) at 0.05 C, a very low self-discharge rate of 90% retention (vs. 65% retention on routine separators), and enhanced rate capability. In addition, the fabrication of both PG and PG-modified separators was readily scaled-up for assembling and evaluating lithium-sulfur pouch cells with a large areal sulfur loading of 7.8 mg cm(-2) and the initial discharge capacity was 1135 mA h g(-1) at current density of 0.1 C. This was ascribed to the statically and dynamically suppressed shuttle effects through both the physical trapping of polysulfides into porous graphene and chemical binding of intermediates on poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) binder in a working cell.

It is demonstrated that the coated separator greatly improves cell performance. Although a quite commonly elemental sulfur cathode was employed, Li-S cell loading the cathode and coated separator still delivers a reversible capacity of up to 688 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles, with a decay rate of only 0.0017% per cycle based on the second discharge. The coated separator restrains polysulfides by a combination of physical and chemical interaction, hence suppressing shuttle effect during cycling. Besides, the coating contributes a highly conductive and hydrophilic surface, increasing the utilization of active material and reducing charge-transfer resistance.

Inspired by eco-friendly and bio-derived materials, we synthesized highly porous carbon from cinnamon sticks. The bio-carbon had an ultra-high surface area and large pore volume, which serves the dual functions of making sulfur particles highly conductive and acting as a polysulfide reservoir. Sulfur was predominantly impregnated into pores of the carbon, and the inter-connected hierarchical pore structure facilitated a faster ionic transport. The strong carbon framework maintained structural integrity upon volume expansion, and the unoccupied pores served as polysulfide trapping sites, thereby retaining the polysulfide within the cathode and preventing sulfur loss. These mechanisms contributed to the superior performance of the lithium-sulfur cell, which delivered a discharge capacity of 1020 mAh g(-1) at a 0.2C rate. Furthermore, the cell exhibited improved kinetics, with an excellent cycling stability for 150 cycles with a very low capacity decay of 0.10% per cycle. This strategy of combining all types of pores (micro, meso and macro) with a high pore volume and ultra-high surface area had a synergistic effect on improving the performance of the sulfur cathode.

Nevertheless, the practical application of Li-S batteries is hindered by the inevitable "shuttle effect" of the soluble lithium polysulfide, which leads to fast capacity degradation, low coulombic efficiency and severe self-discharge. To address these issues, we propose an ultralight carbon flakes modified separator (CFs@PP) that improves the conductivity and works as an effective polysulfide barrier for high-performance Li-S batteries. The CFs are easily obtained by the direct carbonization of sodium citrate, making it possible for large scale manufacture. With the CFs@PP separator employed, the Li-S battery delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1063 mAh g(-1) and retains 683 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C with a low capacity decay rate of 0.071% per cycle. Moreover, great rate performance and small self-discharge are also acquired with the CFs@PP separator applied. The facile preparation of the CFs and the superior electrochemical performance of the CFs@PP separator may promote the commercialization of Li-S batteries. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The MoO3, as a polar transition metal oxide, has strong chemisorption on polysulfides, which can effectively alleviate the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the flake-like MoO3 can effectively immobilize the active substance sulfur. Furthermore, CNTs have excellent conductivity and abundant nanometer reaction sites. Benefitting from the synergistic effects of MoO3 and conductive CNTs, the MoO3/CNTs/S cathode exhibits the superior electrochemical performance. The initial specific discharge capacity of MoO3/CNTs/S cathode is 1237.0 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. The initial specific discharge capacity of MoO3/CNTs/S cathode is 976.9 mAh g(-1), and there is a reversible capacity of 391.4 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles, and the capacity decay rate is 0.075% at 0.5 C.

However, practical electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries needs to be improved. In this work, a new method is described to prepare carbon matrix for sulfur to improve electrochemical properties of sulfur electrodes. The carbon matrix is prepared by deoxidizing carbon precursor synthesized by carbonizing sucrose with concentrated sulfuric acid. Carbon matrix-sulfur composite has been characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared. Results indicate that carbon matrix-sulfur composite is composed of lamellas. The lamella contains a layer of carbon coating on the outside and chemical bonds of C-S. The formation of C-S bonds is promoted by deoxidizing carbon precursor. The carbon matrix-sulfur electrode exhibits improved discharge properties, which results from the appropriate structure. Carbon coating and C-S bonds confine sulfur and maintain contact between sulfur species and conductive carbon matrix. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the viable commercialization of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries is still an obstacle by fast capacity fading and poor cycling stability mostly caused by the polysulfide shuttle and active sulfur material loss. In this contribution, we show that the surface modification of the commercial polypropylene separator with a nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon enhances the interfacial interaction between the N-dopants on carbon-coating and the sulfur-related species by coupling interactions. These unique physical and interfacial chemical properties of the N-doped mesoporous carbon-coating promote the chemical adsorption and confinement of lithium (poly)sulfide intermediates in the cathode side, improving the active material utilization and hence the overall electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries: high initial discharge capacity of 1364 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and notable cycling stability with high reversible capacity of 566 mAh g(-1) and negligible degradation rate of 0.037% after 1200 cycles at 0.5C. Furthermore, despite the use of a simple-mixed sulfur-carbon black cathode with high-sulfur loading of 3.95 mg cm(-2), the cell with a hybrid separator delivers a high areal capacity of similar to 3 mAh cm(-2).

However, serious capacity attenuation and poor cycling stability induced by the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates can impede the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein we report a novel sulfur cathode by intertwining multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and porous boron nitride fibers (BNFs) for the subsequent loading of sulfur. This structural design enables trapping of active sulfur and serves to localize the soluble polysulfide within the cathode region, leading to low active material loss. Compared with CNTs/S, CNTs/BNFs/S cathodes deliver a high initial capacity of 1222 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. Upon increasing the current density to 4 C, the cell retained a capacity of 482 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with a capacity decay of only 0.044 % per cycle. The design of CNTs/BNFs/S gives new insight on how to optimize cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Among the most promising next generation energy storage batteries, we can find lithium-sulfur batteries that have a high theoretical specific capacity and high energy density. In the present article we propose the use of peanut shells, a regional industrial waste of high availability and polluting level, as a source of carbonaceous material for the preparation of sulfur cathode of this kind of batteries. Different carbon were obtained from pyrolysis of peanut shells by changing the conditions of the synthesis, which was performed through acid or basic pre-treatment of the biomass. The effects of these treatments in the physical characteristics of the carbonaceous materials and their performance as cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries were studied. Chemical treatments of shells before pyrolysis as well as the post-pyrolysis treatment of the produced carbon have influence on the porosity of the final materials and therefore on their electrochemical performance. The best electrode carbon was obtained from acid-treated peanut shells (and washed after pyrolysis) obtaining an initial specific capacity of 778 mAh/g with high cycling stability and a coulombic efficiency higher than 95%. We also compare the performance of the best peanut shells-derived biocarbon with one commercial carbon (Super P). In this work, we study a simple route to develop low-cost carbon materials arising from residual biomass which may extend their use in energy storage applications.

In this regard, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) doped with gaseous-phase silica/sulfur composite (GPSiO(2)-CNTs/S-X) at different mass ratios are synthesized through solid-state fusion method and used as cathode for Li-S cells. Results show that GPSiO(2)-CNTs/S cathode with a mass ratio of 3:1:7 can maximize the duration of the discharge platform. In addition, a high initial discharge capacity of 1508 mAh g(-1) is obtained at 0.1 C. The excellent properties of the GPSiO(2)-CNT/S composite can be attributed to its special 3D structure, which facilitates the reutilization of the trapped active material and considerably improves the conductivity of sulfur cathode.

However, the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur and the high solubility of polysulfides in organic electrolytes lead to poor cycling stability and rate capability. Herein, we report a three-dimensional (3D) nanocomposite network made from nitrogen-doped carbon nanoribbon (NCNB) and nitrogen-doped graphene (NG), which has a high electronic conductivity and can serve as a conductive matrix and a sulfur immobilizer for the sulfur cathode. The NCNB is prepared by thermal nitridation of a unique 3D phenolic resin (PHF) isolated from the polycondensation reaction of 1,4-hydroquinone and formaldehyde. The N content of NCNB-NG can reach as high as 9.7 wt%. Although three types of N bonding geometries, including pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, are identified in the NCNB-NG composites, we found the pyridinic N is dominant, which facilitates the trapping of intermediate lithium polysulfides. The sulfur was loaded on NCNB-NG by using a Na2S2O3 solution as sulfur source. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show that almost no large S particle can be observed in the as-prepared S@NCNB-NG nanocomposites, suggesting a uniform coating of S on the NCNB-NG networks. The transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images and the elemental mapping by Energy-Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis also show that nano-sized S particles are uniformly distributed on the NCNB-NG matrix. The as-obtained S@NCNB-NG cathode can deliver a high specific capacity of 1338 mA.h.g(-1) at 0.05 C with about 80% S utilization. It also exhibits excellent rate capability and good cycle stability with a retained specific capacity of 556 mA.h.g(-1) after 300th cycles. These performances are much higher than the control samples using the S@NCNB and the S@PHF nanocomposites as cathodes. The improved performance can be attributed to the unique microstructure and the improved electronic conductivity of the NCNB-NG matrix.

As an ideal sulfur host, a three-dimensional (3D) graphene framework is adopted for high-performance Li-S batteries. Considering the special function of the CoS2 nanoparticles and the advantages of a 3D porous graphene framework, a porous CoS2/reduced graphene oxide (CoS2/rGO) binder-free sulfur host is prepared by a bottom-up assembly and hydrothermal treatment. The porous rGO film is stacked by interconnected graphene sheets, and the CoS2 nanoparticles are dispersed on the graphene sheets uniformly, which effectively obstructs the stacking of graphene sheets. As a binder-free sulfur host, the porous CoS2/rGO sulfur host combines the sufficient electron conductivity of the porous rGO framework and the sulfur immobilization interaction of the CoS2 nanoparticles. This host material demonstrates an initial discharge capacity of 993.5 mAh g(-1) and a capacity of 806.7 mAh g(-1) after 110 cycles at 0.5 C.

J	Deng, W; Zhou, XF; Fang, QL; Liu, ZP				Deng, Wei; Zhou, Xufeng; Fang, Qile; Liu, Zhaoping			Graphene/Sulfur Composites with a Foam-Like Porous Architecture and Controllable Pore Size for High Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	CHEMNANOMAT			English	Article						graphene; lithium-sulfur battery; pore size; porous structure; self-assembly	CATHODE; OXIDE; PARTICLES; FRAMEWORK; PAPER	3D macroporous graphene foams are extensively used as sulfur supports for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries owing to their high electrical conductivity and porous structures. Herein, we investigate the electrochemical properties of foam-like porous-graphene-supported sulfur with two distinctive pore sizes as a cathode material in lithium-sulfur batteries. The smaller pore size (similar to 500 nm) remarkably increases the electron pathways to facilitate fast electron transport and alleviate polarization of electrodes during charge-discharge processes, and relatively abundant graphene cages in porous graphene with smaller pore size spatially inhibit the shuttle of polysulfides into the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the high specific surface area and pore volume arising from small pores are beneficial for ultrathin sulfur layer deposition on the graphene surface, which effectively alleviates the formation of Li2S deposition composites and physically suppresses the dissolution of polysulfides. Consequently, the foam-like graphene/sulfur composite cathode with small pore size and high sulfur content (65 wt%) displays higher specific capacity, better rate capability and cycling stability than those of the samples with larger pores. It can retain a high reversible capacity of 606.7 mAhg(-1) after 300 charge-discharge cycles at 1C with 99.0% Coulombic efficiency.

A novel SLMP anode in which hard carbon (HC) was used as the additive and poly-vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as binder was prepared in an argon-filled vacuum glove box. The new negative sheet provides greater surface for electrolyte infiltration, facilitates ion diffusion and improves the utilization of sulfur element.

The effect of the ratio of resorcinol and sodium acetate for carbon aerogels was researched by scanning electron microscope and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller characterizations. Then the carbon aerogels were applied in synthesizing sulfur/carbon aerogel composites through a melting method, the specific capacity and cycle performance of lithium/sulfur batteries that adopted the prepared composites as cathodes were measured by galvanostatic discharge-charge. X-ray diffraction, conductivity measurement, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectra tests were also carried out to help explain the electrochemical performance. Finally, the carbon aerogel with the best properties was chosen for the comparative study of replacement of water by acetone as solvent in the preparation of carbon aerogels. According to our study, the carbon aerogel prepared by ambient pressure drying with high electrical conductivity, controllable pore structure, and high specific surface area was proposed to be used for lithium/sulfur batteries, and the key factors to the performance of carbon aerogel/sulfur composites were discussed.

Hierarchical Porous Carbon Materials Derived from Self-Template Bamboo Leaves for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Self-template; bamboo leaves; hierarchical porous carbon; mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticles; lithium-sulfur batteries	HIGH-PERFORMANCE CATHODE; RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM; MESOPOROUS CARBON; ACTIVATED CARBON; HIGH-CAPACITY; LONG-LIFE; GRAPHENE; NANOSTRUCTURE; POLYSULFIDES; NANOSHEETS	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are attractive and promising energy storage devices due to the large theoretical energy density (2600 Wh kg(-1))and natural abundance of sulfur. However, several intrinsic drawbacks hamper broader application, for example, the poor conductivity, serious shuttle effect, as well as large volume expansion. In this work, hierarchical porous carbon materials (HPCMs) are prepared from natural bamboo leaves by carbonization and HF etching. The biogenetic SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with abundant mesopores in the carbonized bamboo leaves are etched by HF producing hierarchical meso-/microporous carbon that can be exploited to load sulfur on the nanoscale. The HPCMs/S composite loaded with 70.26 wt. % sulfur shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1487 mAhg(-1) at a rate of 0.05C (1C =1675 mAg(-1)) and the capacity of 707 mAh g(-1) is maintained at 1C for over 200 cycles with a capacity decay of only 0.014% per cycle. When the current density is increased from 0.2 to 4C, 623% of the capacity is retained, suggesting good rate capability and promising application to advanced Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We report here on the design and preparation-by combining a facile and green chemical deposition method with an oxidative polymerization approach-of polyaniline (PANI)-modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-graphene oxide (GO)-sulfur (S) nanocomposites with significantly enhanced performance in lithium-sulfur batteries. Such conductive polymer modified CTAB-GO-S nanocomposites as sulfur cathode materials can deliver high specific discharge capacities and long-term cycling performance, i.e., similar to 970 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.2 C and similar to 715 mAh center dot g(-1) after 300 cycles, similar to 820 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.5 C and similar to 670 mAh center dot g(-1) after 500 cycles, similar to 770 mAh center dot g(-1) at 1 C and similar to 570 mAh center dot g(-1) after 500 cycles. The capacity decay was as low as 0.036% per cycle at 0.5 C, and 0.051% per cycle at 1 C. Under the same condition, batteries using PANI-modified CTAB-GO-S as cathodes exhibited higher specific capacity and higher average coulombic efficiency compared with CTAB-decorated GO-S and GO-S nanocomposites. The improved performance can be attributed to the lower charge transfer resistance and the alleviated dissolution of polysulfides in the PANImodified CTAB-GO-S cathodes.

However, one of their major practical problems is the high solubility of long-chain lithium polysulfides and their infamous shuttle effect, which causes low Coulombic efficiency and sulfur loss. Here, we introduced a concept involving the dithiothreitol (DTT) assisted scission of polysulfides into lithium-sulfur system. Our designed porous carbon nanotube/S cathode coupling with a lightweight graphene/DTT interlayer (PCNTs-S@Gra/DTT) exhibited ultrahigh cycle-ability even at 5 C over 1100 cycles, with a capacity degradation rate of 0.036% per cycle. Additionally, the PCNTs-S@Gra/DTT electrode with a 3.51 mg cm(-2) sulfur mass loading delivered a high initial areal capacity of 5.29 mAh cm(-2) (1509 mAh g(-1)) at current density of 0.58 mA cm(-2), and the reversible areal capacity of the cell was maintained at 3.45 mAh cm(-2) (984 mAh g(-1)) over 200 cycles at a higher current density of 1.17 mA cm(-2). Employing this molecule scission principle offers a promising avenue to achieve high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Unfortunately, the sluggish reaction kinetics, weak adsorption toward to lithium polysulfides, and slow lithium ion diffusion impede the smooth electrochemical process, resulting in the lithium-sulfur batteries with the unsatisfactory cycling stability and rate performance. Since it is recognized that polar metal oxides and doped nitrogen in carbon materials have chemical interaction with lithium polysulfides, a nanostructured nitrogen-doped porous carbon/MoO2 composite is synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method by using graphene oxide nanoribbon and phosphomolybdic acid hydrate as precursors. The porous nanostructure promotes the charge and mass transport, while MoO2 nanoparticles immobilize lithium polysulfides via strong chemisorption and enhance the redox kinetics of polysulfides owing to the efficient catalytic activity in liquid-solid boundary. Consequently, the as-obtained nanostructured porous carbon/MoO2-based sulfur cathode exhibits low polarization, high initial discharge capacity (1403 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), good rate capabilities (584 mAh g(-1) at 4 C), and impressive cycling performance at 1 C (503 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with capacity fade rate of 0.07% per cycle).

Currently, much attention has been paid to modify site and effectiveness of electrocatalysts. Herein, the commercial platinum carbon (Pt/C) material was investigated to modify the polypropylene separator from the cathode side (PP@Pt battery), which was compared with the cathode doped (C-S-Pt) and unmodified (PP) batteries. The results show that PP@Pt battery delivers superior cycle performance and cycling stability than other batteries, confirming that the catalytic effect of Pt/C layer on the separator precede that of cathode doping. This is attributed to that the highly dispersed Pt/C layer is in intimate contact with the sulfur electrode to provide sufficiently active sites, which not only enhances the electronic conductivity but also provides a desired reaction site.

To overcome the bottleneck, herein we designed a Nickel foam/graphene/sulfonated carbon nanotubes (NG/CNTs-SO3-) three-dimensional (3D) interconnected electrode. Nickel foam weaved with 1D multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and 2D graphene (named as NG/CNTs) is used as the host for sulfur accommodation, forming a continuously ion-electronic conductive 3D network and boosting fast redox reaction kinetic. Moreover, the negatively charged -SO3- groups transform the cathode surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, and it not only acts as constructing ion-selective layer for suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides, but also accelerates the polysulfides conversion process by strong adsorption sites to anchor polysulfides. In addition, the grafted -SO3- groups reinforce the rapid transportation of lithium-ion five times than none negatively charged groups decorated ones. The Li-S batteries with NG/CNTs-SO3- cathode delivers an initial capacity of 1380 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, retaining a capacity of 1043.5 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. Furthermore, the cells with NG/CNTs-SO3- cathode also exhibits excellent cycling stability with capacity decay of 0.031% at 2 C and rate capability, which confirms it is outstanding to improve the electrochemical performance and inhibit the shuttle effect.

However, this process exhibits large polarization and low sulfur utilization and suffers critical capacity fade. The primary approach to tackle the problem has so far been to infiltrate sulfur into nanostructured carbon. However, most studies using porous carbon as host materials have tested with high electrolyte to sulfur ratios (E/S) (generally > 15 mu L mg(-1)) that compromise the cell-level energy density. Here, a flower-shaped porous carbon structure with nickel nanoparticles that can address the problems discussed above is designed. First, the 3D flower-shaped carbon structure enables short ionic transport lengths. Second, the small pore diameters 3300 m(2) g(-1) with sufficient pore volume are ideal for charging performance for low E/S ratios. Finally, Ni nanoparticles are employed onto the flower-shaped network to improve the reaction kinetics. Collectively, it is successfully demonstrated that the batteries with a high mass loading of 5 mg cm(-2) and a 5 mu L mg(-1) E/S ratio can retain cycle retention of 70% after 150 cycles.

J	Wu, JF; Ding, SY; Ye, SH; Lai, C				Wu, Junfeng; Ding, Siyu; Ye, Shihai; Lai, Chao			Grafting polymeric sulfur onto carbon nanotubes as highly-active cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Polymeric sulfur; Carbon nanotubes; DFT calculations; High capacity	INFRARED-SPECTRA; POROUS CARBON; ELEMENTAL-SULFUR; POLYSULFIDES; EFFICIENCY; FRAMEWORK; ELECTRODE; NETWORK	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are being explored as promising advanced energy storage systems due to their ultra-high energy density. However, fast capacity fading and low coulombic efficiency, resulting from the dissolution of polysulfides, remain a serious challenge. Compared to weak physical adsorptions or barriers, chemical confinement based on strong chemical interaction is a more effective approach to address the shuttle issue. Herein, we devise a novel polymeric sulfur/carbon nanotube composite for Li-S battery, for which 2, 5-dithiobiurea is chosen as the stabilizer of long-chain sulfur. This offers chemical bonds which bridge the polymeric sulfur and carbon nanotubes. The obtained composite can deliver an ultra-high reversible capacity of 1076.2 mAh g(-1) (based on the entire composite) at the rate of 0.1 C with an exceptional initial Coulombic efficiency of 96.2%, as well as remarkable cycle performance. This performance is mainly attributed to the reaction reversibility of the obtained polymeric sulfur-based composite during the discharge/charge process. This was confirmed by density functional theory calculations for the first time. (C) 2019 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, the dissolution of polysulfides and uncontrolled deposition of insoluble discharge product significantly hinder the cycling stability. Herein, a nanospace-confinement copolymerization strategy for encapsulating polymeric sulfur into porous carbon matrix is presented. The morphologies and sulfur contents of carbon/polymeric sulfur (C/PS) composites could be readily tailored by controlling the copolymerization time. Confining polymeric sulfur in the porous carbon with abundant interparticle pores facilitates rapid electronic/ionic transport and mitigates dissolution of polysulfides intermediates. More importantly, the organic sulfur units dispersed in the insoluble/insulating Li2S2/Li2S phase could prevent its irreversible deposition. Such nanostructure with tailored chemistry property permits the C/PS electrodes to exhibit enhanced cycling stability and high rate capability. The nanospace-confinement copolymerization strategy features general and facial advantages, which may provide new opportunities for the future development of advanced sulfur cathodes.

However, poor conductivity of the sulfur cathode, huge volume expansion, shuttling effect and sluggish catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfide hinder its commercialization. Herein, a 3D hierarchical porous carbon loaded with atomically dispersed Fe-N-4 was developed as a sulfur cathode, which not only offers enhanced electronic conductivity, but also alleviates volume expansion. Moreover, density functional theory calculation results suggest that the Fe-N-4 sites are favorable to enhance the diffusion and promote the conversion of lithium polysulfide.

Herein, a uniformly CeO2 doped three-dimensional porous nitrogen-rich carbon nanofiber (CeO2@CNF) is prepared as an advanced sulfur electrode matrix. Carbon nanofibers with good electrical conductivity and abundant pores can effectively store sulfur and inhibit the shuttle of polysulfides by double physicochemical sulfur coordination.

However, sulfur cathodes suffer from low specific capacity caused by the poor electrical conductivities of the active materials and fast capacity decay resulting from polysulfide dissolution/shuttling. Herein, we report a facile and low-cost method to solve these problems using an activated carbon (AC)-NiFe2O4/S hybrid material in which NiFe2O4 is uniformly distributed on AC through a simple wet impregnation method. The AC-NiFe2O4/S material not only has a strong catalytic effect on sulfur reduction, but also provides strong binding sites to trap polysulfide intermediates. An AC-NiFe2O4/S electrode shows favorable electrochemical properties including stable reversible capacity (0.24% capacity decay per cycle at 0.1 C, retaining a capacity of 602.7 mAh g(-1) after 170 cycles; stable cycling at 0.5 C, retaining a capacity of 501.9 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles), excellent rate performance, and fast electrochemical reaction kinetics compared with those of a reference AC/S electrode, which are attributed to the synergistic effects between NiFe2O4 and AC.

However, the inevitable shuttle effect of polysulfides (LiPSs) seriously restrains its commercial application. Here, nano-MgO with crab shell-based hierarchical porous carbon composites (nano-MgO@CSHPC) have been successfully prepared and employed as effective sulfur species micro-reactors for the Li-S battery. The hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure of CSHPC can provide enough area to physically restrict the LiPSs migration and accommodate the volume expansion. Besides, the nano-MgO formed in the carbon pore can chemically anchor the LiPSs and minimize LiPSs dissolution. Moreover, the nitrogen in the CSHPC can availably enhance LiPSs restriction and improve the conductivity of carbon network. Our work reveals that the rational design of sulfur species micro-reactor simultaneously achieves LiPSs immobilization and conversion, which is helpful to promote the practical application of Li-S battery.

Herein, we report the crafting of a robust 3D graphene-wrapped, nitrogen-doped, highly mesoporous carbon/sulfur (G-NHMC/S) hierarchical aerogel as an effective polysulfide confinement matrix for a highly stable Li-S battery. Rich polar sites of NHMC firmly anchor LiPSn on the matrix surface. Porous NHMC provides ample space for accommodating sulfur and cushioning its volume expansion. Moreover, graphene wrapped on NHMC/S not only physically hinders the LiPSn shuttle but also interconnects the isolated NHMC/S, thus increasing electron transfer rate. Taken together, triple confinement of G-NHMC/S aerogel synergistically retains the soluble LiPSn and displays a specific capacity of 1322 mAh g(-1) and 1000-cycle life. As such, rationally designed 3D carbon/sulfur aerogel affords a unique platform to impart high energy density and stable electrodes for energy storage devices.

Recent studies have shown the metal (Pt, Au, Ni) as electrocatalyst of lithium polysulfides and improved the performance for lithium sulfur batteries. In this work, we present the nickel coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Ni-MWNTs) as additive materials for elemental sulfur positive electrodes for lithium-sulfur rechargeable batteries. Compared with MWNTs, the obtained Ni-MWNTs/sulfur composite cathode demonstrate a reversible specific capacity approaching 545 mAh after 200 cycles at a rate of 0.5C as well as improved cycling stability and excellent rate capacity. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the fact the MWNTs shows a vital role on polysulfides adsorption and nickel has a catalytic effect on the redox reactions during charge-discharge process. Meanwhile, the Ni-MWNTs is a good electric conductor for sulfur cathode.

Recently, it has been found that adding a multifunctional interlayer between cathode and separator can effectively inhibit the shuttle of polysulfides, while the lightweight factor of the interlayer commonly is ignored. In this work, a kind of lightly freestanding interlayer (0.16-0.4 mg cm(-3)) consisting of CeF3 nanorod (prepared by in situ fluorination of CeO2 nanorod in carbonization at 700 degrees C) and carbon nanotubes film (CF) is prepared. In this network structure, the CF network displays high electronic conduction and enhances the reaction kinetics for sulfur; CeF3 can effectively adsorb polysulfides and enhance the cycle performance. Especially, the battery exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1505 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C, and the capacity decay after 100 cycles is only 0.063% per cycle. In addition, it retains a discharge capacity of 951 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.2 C and 542 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles at 1 C. Lightly freestanding CeF3/CNTs interlayer show a high application potential in the lithium-sulfur batteries.

This observation is confirmed by ex-situ transmission electron microscopy study and first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that this capacity fading mechanism can be overcome by introducing amphiphilic polymers to modify the carbon surface, rendering strong interactions between the nonpolar carbon and the polar LixS clusters. The modified sulfur cathode show excellent cycling performance with specific capacity close to 1180 mAh/g at C/5 current rate. Capacity retention of 80% is achieved over 300 cycles at C/2.

However, several issues including shuttle effect, lithium dendrites, and volumetric expansion se-riously impede the commercial applications of LSBs. One-dimensional carbon materials (1DCMs) have been widely used as the matrix material for LSBs due to their high surface area, superior conductiv-ity, good flexibility, excellent mechanical stability, and functional modifiability. In this review, the recent progress in 1D carbon-based composites as cathode including metal compounds/1DCMs, MOFs/1DCMs, MXenes/1DCMs, and polymers/1DCMs were discussed. Different strategies for polysulfide confinement and analysis of the functions of various components in the composites were summarized detailly. In the end, the current challenges of LSBs were systematically summarized, and the future outlooks were proposed, aiming at providing a comprehensive insight into the design of new host materials for next -generation LSBs.

However, the low sulfur content in the cathode electrode greatly decrease the practical energy density of the Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a reduced graphene oxide-hollow carbon sphere (rGO-HCS) composite to encapsulate sulfur with high sulfur contents from 70 to 90 wt% as sulfur cathode. The rGO-HCS/S composite loading 90 wt% sulfur delivers the highest energy density of 1281 Wh kg(-1) based on the mass of the whole cathode, even at a high sulfur areal density of 3 mg cm(-2), it could still reach a high discharge capacity of 860 mA h g(-1) (corresponding to 1300 Wh kg(-1) based on mass of the whole cathode) and obtain a high capacity retention of 77% after 78 cycles.These results indicate the great potential of the rGO-HCS nanostructure as promising sulfur host loading high content of sulfur with high gravimetric and volumetric energy density.

Therefore, we demonstrate a methodology to design and develop a multifunctional interlayer based on carbon nanofiber (CNF) with Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe3C-CNF), which can simultaneously improve the electrical conductivity and reduce the shuttling effect by entrapping soluble polysulfides. The three-dimensional network-like structure of the Fe3C-CNF interlayer with uniformly distributed Fe3C nanoparticles not only enables the efficient deposition of active materials but also enhances the electron transfer of sulfur species. The Fe3C nanoparticles can effectively reduce the interfacial resistance and enhance the kinetics of the redox reaction of the sulfur material as a catalyst. A Li-S battery with a Fe3C-CNF interlayer and a conventional cathode (prepared by merely blending sulfur and conductive carbon) exhibits a capacity of 941 mAh g(-1) and average Coulombic efficiency of 98.0% at 0.2 C. Even after 250 cycles at 1.0 C, the Li-S battery with the Fe3C-CNF interlayer exhibits a reversible discharge capacity of 804 mAh g(-1), with an average capacity decay of 0.091% per cycle. The methodology proposed herein aids in the development of next-generation Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lithium-sulfur battery was considered to be the next generation of new energy storage systems. However, the solubility, deposition, and shuttle effect of polysulfides of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries checked the practical applications owing to low coulomb efficiency and the loss of active substances. Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) can be used as a shear agent to transfer higher order lithium-polysulfide compounds (Li2Sx, x > 6) into low-order lithium-polysulfide compounds (Li2Sx, x < 4). The dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides were checked with an increase of utilization rate of active substances. The performance of charge and discharge and cycle of lithium-sulfur battery also were improved. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) provided high conductivity and maintained structural integrity of electrode, the diameter of MWCNTs is about 80 nm, and length is about 15 mu m. The electrochemical test results showed that the first discharge capacity of electrode with TCEP interlayer reached 1410 mAh/g at a rate of 0.05 C, and the utilization rate of active material was as high as 84.6%. After 10 cycles at 3 C ratio, the discharge specific capacity still reached 526 mAh/g and the coulomb efficiency remained at 90.6%. It showed good rate and cycling performance.

The benefit of the process presented here is the removal of all pore building components by pyrolysis of the ZnO/carbon composite without any need for either toxic/reactive gases or purification of the as-prepared hierarchical porous carbon. The carbothermal reduction process is accompanied by an advantageous growing of distinctive micropores within the thin carbon walls. The resulting materials show not only high internal porosity (total pore volume up to 3.9 cm(3) g(-1)) but also a large number of electrochemical reaction sites due to their remarkably high specific surface area (up to 3060 m(2) g(-1)), which renders them particularly suitable for the application as sulfur host material. Applied in the lithium-sulfur battery, the HPC/sulfur composite exhibits a capacity of >1200 mAh g(-1)-sulfur (>750 mAh g(-1) electrode) at a high sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2) as well as outstanding rate capability. In fact, this impressive performance is achieved even using a low amount of electrolyte (6.8 l mg(-1) (sulfur)) allowing for further weight reduction and maintenance of high energy density on cell level.

Here, we propose the design principles for the chemical functioned graphene as an anchor material to realize both strong chemical trapping and catalysis. Through the first principle, the periodic law is calculated from the theory. Seven different co-doping series were investigated, e.g. MN4@graphene (M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu). From binding energy, partial density of state, and charge density difference analysis, the FeN4 and CrN4 co-doped graphene show good performance for the lithium-sulfur battery from both strong anchoring and catalytic effects. For the most kinds of Li2Sx (x = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) absorption, two combinations can be achieved, including S-bonding and Li-bonding. The competition between the M-S and the N-Li shows the main difference of the co-doped configurations. Moreover, the S-bonding systems have better performance for both moderate chemical trapping and strong catalysis. The binding energies of Li2Sx and Li decomposed properties considered as the key descriptors for the rational design of lithium-sulfur battery. Lastly, we offer design rules for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries based on the chemical functional graphene materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Herein, the free-standing carbon film consisting of porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is successfully fabricated by the electrospinning technology. The PCNF/CNT film with three-dimensional and interconnected structure is promising for the uniformity of the high-loading sulfur, good penetration of the electrolyte, and reliable accommodation of volumetric expansion of the sulfur cathode. In addition, the abundant N/O-doped elements in PCNF/CNT film are helpful to chemically trap soluble polysulfides in the charge-discharge processes. Consequently, the obtained monolayer S/PCNF/CNT film as the cathode shows high specific capacity, excellent cycle stability, and rate stability with the sulfur loading of 3.9 mg cm(-2). Moreover, the high areal capacity of 13.5 mA h cm(-2) is obtained for the cathode by stacking three S/PCNF/CNT layers with the high sulfur loading of 12 mg cm(-2). The stacking-layered cathode with high sulfur loading provides excellent cycle stability, which is beneficial to fabricate high-energy-density Li-S battery in future.

The lithium-sulfur cell employing the polydopamine-coated separator displays a high specific capacity of 670 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 200 cycles, which is higher than that of the cell with routine separator. Additionally, the coulombic efficiency of the cell is also improved obviously after using the polydopamine-coated separator. The improved performance can be attributed to the physical inhibition by the polydopamine coating layer. Besides, due to the highly hydrophilic property of polydopamine, a hydrophilic surface chemical gradient is constructed to trap the polysulfides.

In this paper, carbon nanotubes materials with good conductivity are used as the substrate. Co2P with catalytic function is grown on the surface of carbon nanotubes by hydrothermal method as the host material of lithium-sulfur batteries. It is characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and element mapping. The results showed that Co2P was successfully synthesized on the surface of carbon nanotubes. The study found that the addition of Co2P can promote the conversion of Li2S6 to Li2S4 and Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S, and inhibit the shuttle-through effect, improve the cycle stability of lithium-sulfur batteries, and the initial capacity reaches 1372 mAh/g at a current density of 0.1 C, the coulomb efficiency is above 96% with cycled 200 times at a current density of 0.2 C.

Current studies about carbon hosts are more frequently focused on the design of carbon structures rather than modification of its properties. In this study, we use boron-doped porous carbon materials as the host material of the S cathode to get an insightful investigation of the effect of B dopant on the S/C cathode. Powder electronic conductivity shows that the B-doped carbon materials exhibit higher conductivity than the pure analogous porous carbon. Moreover, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we prove that doping with B leads to a positively polarized surface of carbon substrates and allows chemisorption of S and its polysulfides. Thus, the B-doped carbons can ensure a more stable S/C cathode with satisfactory conductivity, which is demonstrated by the electrochemical performance evaluation. The S/B-doped carbon cathode was found to deliver much higher initial capacity (1300 mA h g(-1) at 0.25 C), improved cyclic stability, and rate capability when compared with the cathode based on pure porous carbon. Electrochemical impedance spectra also indicate the low resistance of the S/B-doped C cathode and the chemisorption of polysulfide anions because of the presence of B. These features of B doping can play the positive role in the electrochemical performance of S cathodes and help to build better Li-S batteries.

Herein we have demonstrated a facile strategy for fabricating free-standing carbon paper supported Li2S@C (P-Li2S@C) integrated cathode. The P-Li2S@C cathode is synthesized through simple pyrolysis of low-cost lithium sulfate (Li2SO4) and chitosan, and embedded in the double carbon matrixes with carbon paper support and outer CVD-carbon layer. Li2S nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed in the above designed double carbon matrixes. The P-Li2S@C cathode exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 820 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and still maintains 430 mAh g(-1) lafter 100 cycles, superior to the P-Li2S counterpart (480 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 150 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles). Our research verifies the effectiveness of double carbon modification on the Li2S, especially, the outer carbon coating not only improves the electrical conductivity of electrode, but also further prohibits the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides.

Intensively studied carbon/sulfur (C/S) composite cathodes are the key elements to determine the performance of Li-S batteries. Herein, a novel in-situ nitrogen-doped porous carbon possessing ultrahigh surface area (2163.776 m(2)/g) and total pore volume (1.048 cm(3)/g) was obtained from hickory-shell via a transitional KOH activation process. Numerous pores in micro-scale offer substantial active sites for sulfur adsorption and accommodate the volume expansion during the charge/discharge cycles. Meanwhile, the nitrogen-doped carbon promotes polysulfides adsorption and improves the conductivity of the carbon framework. C/S composite cathodes of different sulfur loadings were investigated to exhibit that the composite with 55% sulfur delivers the highest initial discharge capacities of 1446.1 and 991.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 1.0C rate, respectively, with a tiny capacity fading rate of 0.095% per cycle up to 1000 cycles at 1.0C. Considering the low cost, environmental friendliness and excellent electrochemical performances, this nitrogen-doped porous carbon exhibits great potential in applications of high performance Li-S batteries.

The morphology, structure and composition of the BUCNTs/S-1 composite were characterized and the effect of B doping and sulfur loading were also investigated in details. The results demonstrated that the participation of B atom and sulfur loading achieved by hydrothermal method endowed the BUCNTs host with enhanced conductivity, promoted sulfur dispersibility and strengthened adsorbability for the sulfur species. The electrochemical performances of the BUCNTs/S-1 used as lithium-sulfur cathodes were then studied. Benefitting from all the merits, the BUCNTs/S-1 cathode delivered a high initial capacity of similar to 1251 mAh/g at 0.2C, retaining as high as similar to 750 mAh/g after 400 cycles, displaying significantly enhanced cycling stability. Hence, this work provides a facile method to fabricate a promising sulfur cathode candidate for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, shuttle effect and slow reaction kinetics hinder further commercialization of Li-S batteries. In the present work, CeO2-xSx was prepared using S-doped CeO2 as a cathode material to address some existing challenges of Li-S batteries. After density function theory calculations, it was found that S doping not only effectively shortens the band gap but also enhances the adsorption capacity of the composite to Li2S6, which has a positive effect on mitigating the shuttle effect. The battery also has a highly reversible cycling capability. The first charge/discharge capacity of the battery at 0.1C reached 1380 mAh/g, while the capacity retention rate of the battery reached 90% after 500 cycles at 1C. This provides a new idea for anion doping to be used to enhance the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Deriving carbon materials from low-cost and sustainable biomass is eco-friendly. Cotton, one of the most abundant biomass materials, naturally holds a hierarchically porous structure, making the activated cotton textile (ACT) an ideal scaffold for loading active materials. Here, we report a low-cost approach to massively producing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via a combination process of vaporliquid-solid (VLS) and solid-liquid-solid (SLS) where cotton decomposed into carbon-containing gases and amorphous carbons that then dissolved into Fe nanoparticles, forming Fe/Fe3C-encapsulated MWCNTs. The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery constructed by the Fe/Fe3C-MWCNT@ACT/S composite (as the cathode) and the Fe/Fe3C-MWCNT@ACT (as the interlayer) exhibited a superlative cycling stability (over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C), an ultralow capacity decay rate (0.0496% per cycle) and a remarkable specific capacity (1273 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C). The Fe/Fe3C-MWCNTs enhanced electrode stability and suppressed polysulfide dissolution during cycling.

However, most reports of the high gravimetric specific capacity and long cyclic life are not practically reliable because of their low areal specific capacity derived from the low areal sulfur loading and low sulfur content. Here, we fabricated a highly porous graphene with high pore volume of 3.51 cm(3) g(-1) as the sulfur host, enabling a high sulfur content of 80 wt %, and based on this, we further proposed an all-graphene structure for the sulfur cathode with highly conductive graphene as the current collector and partially oxygenated graphene as a polysulfide-adsorption layer. This cathode structural design enables a 5 mg cm(-2) sulfur-loaded cathode showing both high initial gravimetric specific capacity (1500 mAh g(-1)) and areal specific capacity (7.5 mAh cm(-2)), together with excellent cycling stability for 400 cycles, indicating great promise for more reliable lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this study, carbon nano-fiber having average fiber diameter of 150 nm was added into the sulfur electrode in order to improve cycling property. The effect of binder on cycling property was also investigated. All cycle tests were conducted in the range of 1.5-3.2 V at room temperature. Sulfur electrodes with carbon nano-fiber using PEO and PVdF as binders, respectively, showed better cycle property than sulfur electrode without carbon nano-fiber.

In this simple work, we used commercially available polymer as carbon source and non-solvent mixture as porogen or pore former. The cathode has been fabricated by using polyacrylonitrile as base polymer via phase inversion route. By this technique, a highly porous substrate material is generated by dipping a semi-gelled film of polyacrylonitrile in non-solvent mixture. After oxidative crosslinking followed by pyrolysis under inert atmosphere results a highly porous nitrogen doped carbon material, which was further hybridized with sulfur via melt diffusion of elemental sulfur. This cathode material shows although relatively low specific capacity (Cycle 1: ca. 1050 mA h/g(sulfur), cycle 500: ca. 400 mA h/g(sulfur)), but excellent cycle stability over 500 charging-discharging cycles is displayed.

How to exert the trash-to-treasure was a strong driving force upon lignocellulose biorefinery that emphasizes a request for upgrading lignin. As a guiding light for two-in-one valorization of low-cost biomass, we reported a NaCl-templated strategy to convert well-defined lignin into porous carbon (LPC) and carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Besides, the affluent pores and channels of LPC can be easily penetrated by molten sulfur to assemble a cathode of lithium-sulfur battery. The LPC@S-installed cathode was able to provide a high sulfur utilization up to 66 wt%, stable cycling lifespan with an initial specific capacity of 1066 mA h g(-1) at 1 C (capacity decay of 0.095 % per cycle over 400 cycles), and acceptable rate capability at a charge/discharge current from 0.1-3 C. The lignin-based CQDs exhibited an average size of 4.18 nm, along with bright fluorescence, long-term stability, and water solubility. Benefitting from these alluring properties, CQDs was efficiently served as the fluorescence-switchable nanoprobes for sensitively detecting common metal ions, which presented a significant fluorescence quenching in response to the presence of ferric iron (Fe3+) with a wide concentration range of 1-220 mu M. It is reasonable to imagine that the present work delivers a versatile settlement to the end-up issue of technical lignin towards a circular material economy.

In this work, a multi-functional separator modified by CeO2 decorated graphene (CeO2@G) is designed to enhance the performance of Li-S batteries. The CeO2 nanoparticles not only immobilize polysulfides by strong chemisorption, but also act as catalytic agent to accelerate polysulfides redox reaction. Moreover, the highly conductive graphene sheets functioned as an upper current collector to improve the electron/ion conductivity and facilitate the reutilization of sulfur species. As a result, the Li-S battery with the CeO2@G modified separator delivers high specific capacity (1546 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1), excellent rate performance (861 mAh g-1 at 3 A g-1), and long-term cycle durability (480 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles). In addition, the modified separator can effectively against the self-discharge behavior. The outstanding electrochemical performance brings us a closer step towards practical applications of Li-S batteries.

It is widely reported that polysulfides are trapped in electrolytes due to the strong chemisorption of polar materials in Li-S batteries. Here, a free-standing NiCo2S4 nanoparticles decorated carbon nanofibers (NiCo2S4-CNFs) interlayer is prepared via electrospinning and simple hydrothermal method for the application in Li-S batteries. Three-dimensional carbon fibers (CNFs) skeleton builds a highly conductive carbon network, which provides a large quantities of transmission paths for electrons and ions. Uniformly distributed NiCo2S4 nanoparticles act as an absorbent of the long-chain lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and a catalyst to accelerate the conversion of sulfur species. Meticulous designed NiCo2S4-CNFs interlayer significantly improves the capacity retention rate and cycle stability of Li-S batteries. It supplies an initial specific capacity of 1421 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, and its capacity remains at 918 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Even at a high current density of 1 C, it still possesses a reversible specific capacity of 515 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles and extremely low capacity decay of 0.06% per cycle. More importantly, the NiCo2S4-CNFs interlayer still delivers excellent electrochemical performance with a higher sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2), which verifies its huge commercial application potential.

However, the polysulfide shuttle effect remains of great concern with a great number of publications dedicated to its mitigation. In this contribution, a three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide/activated carbon (RGO/AC) film, synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and convenient mechanical pressing, is sandwiched between the separator and the sulfur-based cathode, acting as a functional interlayer to capture and trap polysulfide species. Consequently, the Li/S cell with this interlayer shows an impressive initial discharge capacity of 1078 mAh/g and a reversible capacity of 655 mAh/g even after 100 cycles. The RGO/AC interlayer impedes the movement of polysulfide while providing unimpeded channels for lithium ion mass transfer. Therefore, the RGO/AC interlayer with a well-designed structure represents strong potential for high-performance Li/S batteries.

The functional interlayer of NWCNFs is sandwiched between a sulfur cathode and the separator, acting as shuttle inhibitor to the sulfur and polysulfides. The Li-S cells with the NWCNFs functional interlayer shows the superior performance in terms of capacity utilization, reversibility, and enhanced rate capability. It exhibits reversible discharge capacity of 840 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C, maintaining 81% of its initial capacity of 1033 mAh g(-1), which is much higher than that of without NWCNFs ( 260 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C). The improvement on electrochemical performance is attributed to the 3D architecture of NWCNFs as functional interlayer, which can provide a good conductive network with structural stability and the migrating polysulfide to reduce the shuttling phenomenon during the charge-discharge processes.

Herein, a highly crosslinked copolymer is synthesized through thermally activated polymerization of sulfur and trithiocyanuric acid onto the surface of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets. Of the thus-synthesized composites, the sample with a high sulfur content of 81.79 wt.% shows a remarkable rate performance of 1341 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 861 mAh g(-1) at 1 C with an almost 100% coulombic efficiency. The composite electrode also effectively impedes the dissolution of polysulfides and their shuttle diffusion because of the abundant and robust chemical bonding between sulfur and trithiocyanuric acid and spatial confinement of polysulfides by the reduced graphene oxide sheets, which leads to 81.72% retention of the initial capacity even after 500 deep charge-discharge cycles at 1 C, corresponding to a decay rate of only 0.0404% per cycle. This performance is markedly better than those of comparative materials prepared in a similar fashion but at either higher or lower S loading, and among the highest in sulfur copolymer cathodes to date. The results provide an effective paradigm in the preparation and engineering of polymer cathode materials for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The experimental trends of the discharge behavior of a Li-S cell were captured by the model regarding the change in key design parameters. Results were given in comparison with the predictions of two other models that use different active area definitions, and it was concluded that a sensible representation of the electrochemically active area is critical for modeling the effect of cell design on the discharge performance of a Li-S battery.

Herein, Gd2O3 nanoparticles modified wave-like carbon host, which are derived from soybean residue by activation and pyrolysis processes. After the activated soybean residue derived carbon (ASC) host modified by Gd2O3 nanoparticles, the ASC-Gd was integrated with sulfur by melting method and then used as cathode in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. According to the electrochemical results of ASC-Gd/S cathode, a high initial discharge capacity (1343 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and improved cycling stability were exhibited, which was attributed to the strong adsorption ability for polysulfides and ultrahigh specific surface area of the ASC. As a result, the Gd2O3 nanoparticles modified wave-like biomass carbon was a promising host material of Li-S batteries with high performances.

Nevertheless, the serious shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics originated from dissolution of polysulfides and insulating property of sulfur and lithium sulfide, restricted their practical applications. To overcome these stubborn problems, a robust and environment-friendly biomass carbon fiber interlayer anchored with uniformly-distributed SiO2 nanoparticles was demonstrated. Benefiting from the excellent conductivity of carbon fiber, together with the stable chemical adsorption of SiO2 for soluble polysulfides, this low-cost and lightweight interlayer could not only remarkably enhance sulfur utilization, but also efficiently capture the polysulfides by chemical entrapment strategies. With this biomass carbon fiber@SiO2 interlayer, the batteries delivered a high reversible capacity of 1352.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and enhanced capacity of 618.4 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. Even up to 4.2 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading, high cycling stability was also achieved by this interlayer. We believe this robust and low-cost interlayer has a great potential for practical applications of Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein we report a new kind of carbon-sulfur composites by infusing sulfur into the novel hierarchical carbon nanocages (hCNC) with high pore volume, network geometry and good conductivity. The designed S@hCNC composite with a high sulfur loading of 79.8 wt % presents the large capacity, high-rate capability and long cycle life, which could shorten the charging time for mobile devices from hours to minutes. The excellent performance derives from the unique mesostructure of hCNC that enables the encapsulation of high-loading sulfur inside the carbon nanocages to alleviate polysulfide dissolution, meanwhile much enhance the electron conduction and Li-ion diffusion.

Herein, a freestanding electrode with nickel foam framework and nitrogen doped porous carbon (PC) network is presented to encapsulate active sulfur for Li-S batteries. In such a mutually embedded architecture with high stability, the interconnected carbon network and nickel foam matrix can expedite ionic/electronic transport and sustain volume variations of sulfur. Furthermore, rationally designed porous structures provide sufficient internal space and large surface area for high active sulfur loading and polar polysulfides anchoring. Benefiting from the synergistic superiority, the Ni/PC-S cathode exhibits a high initial capacity of around 1200 mAh/g at 0.2 C, excellent rate performance, and high cycling stability with a low decay rate of 0.059% per cycle after 500 cycles. This work provides a useful strategy to exploit freestanding porous framework for diverse applications.

In this work, the solvent's roles in controlling solid Li2S deposition are revealed, and quantitative solvent-mediated Li2S growth models as guides to solvent selection are developed. It is shown that Li2S electrodeposition is controlled by electrode kinetics, Li2S solubility, and the diffusion of polysulfide/Li2S, which is dictated by solvent's donicity, polarity, and viscosity, respectively. These solvent-controlled properties are essential factors pertaining to the sulfur utilization, energy efficiency and reversibility of lithium-sulfur batteries. It is further demonstrated that the solvent selection criteria developed in this study are effective in guiding the search for new and more effective electrolytes, providing effective screening and design criteria for computational and experimental electrolyte development for lithium-sulfur batteries.

To optimizing sulfur utilization and improving the cycling lifespan of Li-S cells, we report a three-dimensional hierarchical porous N-doped graphene (NG) assisted sulfur cathode and its coated separator for high performance of Li-S batteries. In particular, the formation of the novel 3D structure is inspired from the combination of active hydrothermal releasing gas and cohesive action from in situ polymerization of pyrrole. The as prepared 3D N-doped graphene/S composite containing 75 wt% sulfur delivers reversible capacity of 582.7 mAh g (1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C with capacity retention rate of 79.5%. The as-developed 3D N-doped graphene coated on separator as an interlayer could not only enhance the charge-transfer network of cathode but also protect the Li anode from been destroyed. The interlayer cell confirmed enhanced the cycling performance with reversible capacity of 851.8 mAh g (1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C and retain 88.7% of its maximum discharging capacity (666.8 mAh g (1)) after 300 cycles at 0.5 C, suggesting potential strategy to tackle the fundamental challenges underlying high sulfur loading Li-S batteries.

Nevertheless, they also have technical bottlenecks such as the "shuttle effect", poor conductivity of sulfur, and volume change. Herein, an effective porous activated carbon derived from puffed corn is coated on a polypropylene (PP) separator to improve the properties of lithium-sulfur batteries. Puffed corn carbon (PCC) and activated puffed corn carbon (APCC) are prepared by carbonization without and with KOH activation. Combined utilization of Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman, N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technologies demonstrates that the APCC sample has an amorphous carbon structure and it has high specific surface area of 2543.8 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 2.14 cm(3) g(-1). The cell with an APCC-coated separator exhibit an initial discharge capacity of 1045 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, and convert to 471.6 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles. Overall, APCC provides an extensive prospect for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Conductive polar metal compound has strong chemical adsorption of polysulfides but difficult to attain high porosity to encapsulate sulfur series. Instead of efforts on the cathode, we prepared a composite made up of titanium nitride and three-dimensional micro-/mesoporous carbon by a facile and economic way. This composite was coated on the commercial Celgard separator as a polysulfide interceptor to enhance the performances of lithium-sulfur battery. The strategy exerts the synergetic merits of porosity, chemical adsorption, physical interception, and benign conductivity. The hierarchical carbon possesses a high specific surface area of 1571 m(2)/g and total pore volume of 1.56 cm(3)/g with the pore size centered at 1.27 and 5.30 nm. TiN can immobilize sulfur intermediates by strong chemical interaction. In addition, excellent electrical conductivity of TiN facilitates redox kinetics. The pure sulfur cathode with the modified separator delivers high initial capacity of 1130 mAh/g at 1 C (1 C = 1675 mAh/g) and retains 500 mAh/g after 400 cycles, demonstrating superior cycling stability, rate capabilities. Discharge-charge profiles, electrochemical impedance spectrum, and cyclic voltammetry curves of batteries were investigated to support the prominent electrochemistry of the material. Further analysis and observation on the modified separator disassembled from the coin cells after cycling were conducted to probe the evolution and reaction mechanism of the coating.

However, the severe shuttling of behavior caused by the dissolution of lithium polysulfide intermediates during cycling remains a challenge for practical applications. Herein, porous carbon materials co-doped with nitrogen and sulfur atoms were prepared through a facile hydrothermal reaction of graphene oxide and methylene blue to obtain a suitable host structure for regulating the lithium polysulfide shuttling behavior. Experimental results demonstrated that the abundant heteroatom-containing moieties in the carbon frameworks not only generated favorable active sites for capturing lithium polysulfide but also enhanced redox reaction kinetics of lithium polysulfide intermediates.

Melamine was recommended as a nitrogen-rich (N-rich) amine component to synthesize a modified polyacrylic acid (MPAA). The electrospun MPAA was carbonized into N-rich carbon nanofibers, which were used as cathode interlayers, while carbon nanofibers from PAA without melamine was used as an anode interlayer. At the rate of 0.1 C, the initial discharge capacity with two interlayers was 983 mAh g(-1), and faded down to 651 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles with the coulombic efficiency of 95.4%. At the rate of 1 C, the discharge capacity was kept to 380 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. It apparently demonstrated that the cathode interlayer is extremely effective at shutting down the migration of polysulfide ions. The anode interlayer induced the lithium ions to form uniform lithium metal deposits confined on the fiber surface and in the bulk to strengthen the cycling stability of the lithium metal anode.

The as-prepared MCMs possess a narrow pore size distribution (0.5-2.0 nm) and exhibit similar electron conductivities to conductive carbon black (Super P, Timcal). Because of the unique properties of MCMs, they are used as host matrixes to encapsulate sulfur for lithium-sulfur cathodes. The obtained MCMs-sulfur (MCMs-S) composite cathodes deliver a high initial specific capacity of 1667 mAh g(-1). Moreover, 300 degrees C treated MCMs-S composite cathode shows a more stable discharge capacity than the untreated MCMs-S composite cathode, it remains 612 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at a high current density of 0.5 C.

However, due to the low conductivity of the electrode material, the shuttle effect, and the drastic volume change, the battery capacity decays quickly and the cycle life is poor. These problems hinder the commercialization of Li-S batteries. In this paper, a simple hydrothermal method is used to compound the catalytic Ni2P and carbon nanotubes with good conductivity as the host material for the cathode material of the lithium-sulfur battery. Ni2P can catalyze the conversion of multisulfide lithium, which can inhibit the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide during charging and discharging and improve the kinetics of the oxidation reaction.

However, polysulfide dissolution and low electronic conductivity of sulfur cathode usually cause significant capacity fading during cycling. In this paper, we introduce a double-shelled structure of reduced graphene oxide@polyaniline@sulfur (rGO@PANI@S) composite, which not only can prevent volume expansion at sulfur charge/discharge process, inhibit lithium polysulfides dissolution and shuttle in the electrolyte, and also ensure a good electro-conductibility for sulfur cathode materials. The microstructure and electrochemical performance of the rGO@PANI@S cathode are investigated systematically. The results show that polyaniline inner shell with thickness of about 27.5 nm is coated uniformly on the surface of S submicron particles and few-layered reduced graphene oxide sheets are chemically bonded at the outer surface with a high sulfur content (74 wt%). When used as cathode for lithium-sulfur battery, the rGO@PANI@S composite shows an initial capacity of 1482.7 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 100 mA g(-1) and retains reversible capacity of 812.1 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles. This all-solution-based process is scalable and the double-shell wrapping structure has promising candidate in designing rechargeable sulfur cathode for application. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Sulfur-doped ordered mesoporous carbons: A stability-improving sulfur host for lithium-sulfur battery cathodes	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Mesoporous sulfur-functionalized carbon; Lithium-sulfur battery; Furfuryl mercaptan; Energy storage	POROUS CARBON; NITROGEN; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; SILICA; ANODE	We report on sulfur-functionalized ordered mesoporous carbons aimed for lithium-sulfur battery electrode applications with improved charge capacity retention. The carbons were obtained by a hard template strategy using a mixture of furfuryl alcohol and furfuryl mercaptan. For the application as electrode material in lithium-sulfur batteries, the carbons were additionally loaded with sulfur following a traditional melt-diffusion approach. It was found that the sulfur interacts stronger with the sulfur-functionalized carbon matrix than with the non-functionalized material. Electrodes showed very high capacity in the second discharge-charge cycle amounting to approximately 1500, 1200 and 1400 mAh/g (sulfur) for carbon materials with no, medium and high degrees of sulfur functionalization, respectively. More importantly, the sulfur-functionalization of the carbon was found to increase the capacity retention after 50 discharge-charge cycles by 8 and 5% for the carbons with medium and high degrees of sulfur-functionalization, respectively, compared to carbon with no sulfur-functionalization. We attribute this significant improvement to the presence of covalently bound sulfur groups at the internal surface of the functionalized carbon providing efficient anchoring sites for catenation to the sulfur loaded into the pores of the carbons and provide experimental support for this in the form of results from cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Design and development of advanced separators that can inhibit the polysulfide shuttling is critical for the development of lithium sulfur battery. Herein, we report a synergistic modification of polypropylene (PP) separator using multiwall carbon nanotubes loaded with CeO2 nanoparticles (MWCNTs/CeO2). Due to the high polysulfide affinity of CeO2, such a modification enables effective prevention of polysulfide transport through the separator. Besides, MWCNTs in the modification layer also block polysulfides shuttling by physical adsorption and regulate the charge transfer by function as a secondary current collector. As a result of this functional synergy, lithium sulfur battery assembled with PP- MWCNTs/CeO2 separator shows stable discharge performance with a capacity of 520.7 mAh g(-1) retained after 300 cycles.

In this composite, sulfur particles confined to polypyrrole (PPy) are uniformly distributed on the surface of carbon nanotubes. TheMWCNTs@S-PPy composite with a sulfur content of 48.8wt% delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1304.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and remains a stable capacity of 986.3 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles. The significant improvement in the electrochemical performance can be attributed to the core-shell structure supported by the multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and S-PPy composite, which own excellent electronic conductivity and alleviate the "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfide. These results suggest that the MWCNTs@S-PPy composite is a promising cathode material for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

J	Yuan, GH; Jin, HF; Jin, YZ; Wu, LZ				Yuan, Guanghui; Jin, Huafeng; Jin, Yanzi; Wu, Lizhou			Hybrids of MnO2 nanoparticles anchored on graphene sheets as efficient sulfur hosts for high-performance lithium sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Sulfur-MnO2@graphene composite; Physical and chemical adsorptions; Cathode material; Lithium-sulfur battery	LI-S BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; COMPOSITES; NANOSHEETS; REDUCTION; BINDING; PHASE	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is considered as a promising option for electrochemical energy storage applications because of its low-cost and high theoretical capacity. However, the practical application of Li-S battery is still hindered due to the poor electrical conductivity of S cathode and the high dissolution/shuttling of polysulfides in electrolyte. Herein, we report a novel physical and chemical entrapment strategy to address these two problems by designing a sulfur-MnO2@graphene (S-MnO2@GN) ternary hybrid material structure. The MnO2 particles with size of similar to 10 nm are anchored tightly on the wrinkled and twisted GN sheets to form a highly efficient sulfur host. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of GN and MnO2 in both improving the electronic conductivity and hindering polysulfides by physical and chemical adsorptions, this unique S-MnO2@GN composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performances. Reversible specific capacities of 1416, 1114, and 421 mA h g(-1) are achieved at rates of 0.1, 0.2, and 3.2 C, respectively. After a 100 cycle stability test, S-MnO2@GN composite cathode could still maintain a reversible capacity of 825 mA h g(-1).

First of all due to its high theoretical energy density but also for its sustainability and low cost. However, there are still several challenges to take into account such as reducing the shuttle effect, decreasing the amount of conductive carbon to increase the energy density or enhancing the sulfur utilization. Herein, redox-active binders based on polyimide-polyether copolymers have been proposed as a solution to those drawbacks. These multiblock copolymers combine the ability of poly (ethylene oxide) to act as polysulfide trap and the properties of the imide groups to redox mediate the charge-discharge of sulfur. Thus, poly (ethylene oxide) block helps with the shuttle effect and mass transport in the electrode whereas the polyimide part enhances the charge transfer promoting the sulfur utilization. Sulfur cathodes containing pyromellitic, naphthalene or perylene polyimide-polyether binders featured improved cell performance in comparison with pure PEO binder. Among them, the electrode with naphthalene polyimide-PEO binder showed the best results with an initial capacity of 1300 mA h g(-1) at C/5, low polarization and 70% capacity retention after 30 cycles. Reducing the amount of carbon black in the cathode to 5 wt%, the cell with the redox-active binder was able to deliver 500 mA h g(-1) at C/5 with 78% capacity retention after 20 cycles. Our results demonstrate the possibility to reduce the amount of carbon by introducing polyimide-polyether copolymers as redox-active binders, increasing the sulfur utilization, redox kinetics and stability of the cell.

By taking advantage of the self-weaving behavior of N-CNT, binders and current collectors are rendered unnecessary in the cathode, thereby simplifying its manufacturing and increasing the sulfur weight ratio in the electrode. Transmission electronic microscopy showed the formation of a highly developed core-shell tubular structure consisting of S/N-CNT composite with uniform sulfur coating on the surface of N-CNT. As a core in the composite, the N-CNT with N functionalization provides a highly conductive and mechanically flexible framework, enhancing the electronic conductivity and consequently the rate capability of the material.

The impacts of the AG pore structure parameters and sulfur loadings on the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries are systematically investigated. The results show that specific capacity, cycling performance, and Coulombic efficiency of the batteries are closely linked to the pore structure and sulfur loading. An AG3/S composite electrode with a high sulfur loading of 72 wt.% exhibited an excellent long-term cycling stability (50% capacity retention over 1,000 cycles) and extra-low capacity fade rate (0.05% per cycle). In addition, when LiNO3 was used as an electrolyte additive, the AG3/S electrode exhibited a similar capacity retention and high Coulombic efficiency (similar to 98%) over 1,000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of the series of AG3/S electrodes is attributed to the mixed micro/mesoporous structure, high surface area, and good electrical conductivity of the AG matrices and the well-distributed sulfur within the micro/mesopores, which is beneficial for electrical and ionic transfer during cycling.

A key challenge for further improving the specific energy-density of Li-S cells is to understand the mechanisms behind reduced sulfur utilisation at low electrolyte loadings and high discharge currents. While several Li-S models have been developed to explore the discharge mechanisms of Li-S cells, they so far fail to capture the discharge profiles at high currents. In this study, we propose that the slow ionic transport in concentrated electrolyte is limiting the rate capability of Li-S cells. This transport-limitation mechanism is demonstrated through a one-dimensional Li-S model which qualitatively captures the discharge capacities of a sulfolane-based Li-S cell at different currents. Furthermore, our model predicts that a discharged Li-S cell is able regain some capacity with a short period of relaxation. This capacity recovery phenomenon is validated experimentally for different discharge currents and relaxation durations. The transport-limited discharge behavior of Li-S cells highlights the importance of optimizing the electrolyte loading and electrolyte transport property in Li-S cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The sulfur/polyacrylonitrile (S/PAN) core particle has a diameter of similar to 100 nm, whereas the carbon shell is about 2 nm thick. The as-prepared C@S/PAN composite shows outstanding electrochemical performance in lithium/sulfur (Li/S) batteries delivering a high initial discharge capacity of 1416 mAh g(-1). Furthermore, it exhibits similar to 89% retention of the initial reversible capacity over 200 cycles at a constant current rate of 0.1 C. The improved performance contributed by the unique composition and the core-shell structure, wherein carbon matrix can also withstand the volume change of sulfur during the process of charging and discharging as well as provide channels for electron transport. In addition, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) matrix suppresses the shuttle effect by the covalent bonding between sulfur (S) and carbon (C) in the PAN matrix.

Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to address the two drawbacks of sulfur cathode by synthesizing a compact and flexible film cathode with bilayer structure using a two-step vacuum filtration method. Two layers make up the sulfur cathode, active layer (sulfur-acethlene black (S-C) spheres) and barrier layer (three dimensional MnO2-graphene oxide-multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MnO2-GO-CNTs) composites), which are integrated together by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through self-binding. The rGO sheets provide an electrical conductive framework and a stable architecture to accommodate volume changes of sulfur. S-C spheres stacked orderly between the rGO layers facilitate fast Li+ storage and energy release. Polar MnO2-GO-CNTs composites with large specific surface area have not only afforded efficient sites for chemically binding polysulfides, but also provided fast electron trans-fer for accelerating polysulfides redox reaction. Consequently, the integrated film cathode exhibits an unprecedented cycling stability of similar to 0.0279% capacity decay per cycle over more than 600 cycles at 1C and high volumetric capacity of 1021.9 Ah L-1 at 2C. Meanwhile, a foldable Li-S battery based on this flexible cathode is fabricated and shows excellent mechanical and electrochemical properties. The integrated flexible sulfur cathode of this study sheds light on the design strategies for application in flexible high volumetric capacity system. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The development of lithium-sulfur batteries utilizing Li2S cathodes would be a promising option to overcome the capacity limitation. In this work, new three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb-like N-doped carbon nanowebs (HCNs) have been synthesized through a facile aqueous solution route for use as a cathode material in lithium-sulfur batteries. The Li2S@HCNs cathode delivers a high discharge capacity of approximately 815 mAh g(-1) after 65 cycles at 0.1 C, along with a superior rate capacity of approximately 568 mAh g(-1) even at 2 C. The outstanding electrochemical rate performance is ascribed to their unique 3D honeycomb-like nanoweb structure, consisting of nanowires derived from polypyrrole. These properties greatly enhance the electrochemical reaction kinetics by providing efficient electron pathways and hollow channels for electrolyte transport. Nitrogen doping in the carbon nanowebs also considerably improves the chemisorption properties by tuning affinity between sulfur and oxygen functional groups on the carbon framework. The simple synthesis strategy and the resulting unique electrode structure could present a new avenue in nanostructure research for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, sulfur cathodes suffer from several scientific and technical issues which are related to polysulfide ion migration, low conductivity, and volume changes. Many strategies such as porous hosts, polysulfide adsorbents, catalyst, and conductive fillers and so on have been proposed to address these issues, separately. In this study, novel Co3S4 nanotubes are developed to efficiently host sulfur, adsorb polysulfide, and catalyze their conversion. Because of these multifunctional advantages in one structure, the resulting Co3S4@S nanotube electrodes demonstrate superior electrochemical properties for high performance lithium sulfur batteries.

However, it is challenging to design and prepare hierarchical porous carbon nanomaterials with unique structures that have excellent performances for Li-S batteries. Herein, hierarchical carbon foam fibers (HPCFs) with a concentric tube-core/three-dimensional nanosheet-sheath structure have been rationally designed and fabricated through solution-combustion and etching methods, and are suitable for Li-S batteries.

The as-designed structure can efficiently improve conductivity, suppress the dissolution of polysulfides, and provide quick electron-/ion-transfer channels, which are beneficial for designing advanced sulfur cathodes for high-performance Li-S batteries.

To solve this problem, herein CoSx in a composite with nitrogen doped carbon and sulfur (CoSx-NC-S) synthesized from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), was used to restrain shuttle-effect of polysulfides during cycling. The porous N-doped carbon polyhedra can not only improve the electronic conductivity, but also restrict the polysulfides and relieve the volume expansion of sulfur during cycling. Meanwhile, the CoSx nanoparticles embedded in the carbon polyhedra have powerful attraction with polysulfides, which is advantageous to the stable cycling behavior of electrodes. Applied in the lithium-sulfur battery as cathode, CoSx-NC-S electrode delivered a capacity of 952 mAh . g(-1) at 0.2 C after 150 cycles, and 570 mAh . g(-1) after 600 cycles even at the high rate of 2 C, which is significantly superior to the performance of NC-S electrodes and S-C electrodes.

In this study, a carbon cloth infiltrated with a sulfur-containing electrolyte solution (CC-S) was utilized as an additive-free, flexible, high-sulfur-loading cathode. A freestanding carbon cloth performed double duty as a current collector and a sulfur-supporting/trapping material. The active material in the form of Li2S6 dissolved in a 1 M LiTFSI-DOL/DME solution was simply infiltrated into the carbon cloth (CC) during cell fabrication, and its optimal loading amount was found to be in a range between 2 and 10 mg/cm(2) via electrochemical characterization. It was found that the interwoven carbon microfibers retained structural integrity against volume expansion/contraction and that the embedded uniform micropores enabled a high loading and an efficient trapping of sulfur species during cycling. The LSB coin cell employing the CC-S electrode with an areal sulfur loading of 6 mg/cm(2) exhibited a high areal capacity of 4.3 and 3.2 mAh/cm(2) at C/10 for 145 cycles and C/3 for 200 cycles, respectively, with minor capacity loss (<0.03%/cycle). More importantly, such high performance could also be realized in flexible pouch cells with dimensions of 2 cm x 6 cm before and after 300 bending cycles. Simple and inexpensive preparation of sulfur cathodes using CC-S electrodes, therefore, has great potential for the manufacture of high-performance flexible LSBs.

Moreover, the high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mAh.g(-1)), good eco-friendliness, abundant natural resource and low cost of cathode sulfur are also good for the cheap cost and low environmental pollution of Li-S batteries. However, the practical applications of Li-S batteries are severely impeded by several key challenges, such as the low practical specific capacities, low coulomb efficiencies and fast capacity decay, which resulting from the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur and final products Li2S2/Li2S, the shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides and the growth of lithium dendrite during the electrochemical cycling. It is noted that the modification of the polyolefin separators is one of the effective methods to obviously improve the performances of Li-S batteries. In particular, various carbons and their composites are widely used materials for separator modification because of their unique properties, also, many advancements have been achieved. Herein, the research progresses of the various carbons and their composites for separator modification are reviewed, which will provide guidance for the future research on improving the performance of Li-S batteries by separator modification method.

The physical properties of different foils and prepared electrodes were characterized, and the effects of foil type on the electrochemical performance of the cell were investigated. The artificially designed carbon coating on Al foil enhances the adhesion of active material to the current collector, and reduces electrical resistivity of the sulfur electrode. When using carbon-coated Al foil, the electrochemical polarization of Li-S cell is obviously diminished and stable potential plateau can be held. Compared to common bare foil, the carbon-coated foil favors more sulfur utilization and better cycle capability. Especially the carbon-coated foil with a point-plane combined surface framework (DC foil) is preferable for the improvement of electrode properties and cell performance than that covered by merely carbon particle material. A high reversible capacity of 655 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles is exhibited in the cell using DC foil, with low charge-transfer resistance.

High-performance lithium/sulfur cells with a bi-functionally immobilized sulfur cathode	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Lithium/sulfur cell; Lithium sulfide; Sulfur composite cathode; Core-shell nanoparticles; Lithium sulfide cell; Carbon coating	POLYMER ELECTROLYTES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; GRAPHENE OXIDE; ION BATTERIES; SULFIDE; COMPOSITES; NANOFIBERS; PARTICLES; NANOTUBES; ENERGY	Lithium/sulfur (Li/S) cells have a theoretical specific energy five times higher than that of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells (2600 vs. similar to 500 Wh kg(-1)). The conventional Li/S cells that use an organic liquid electrolyte are short-lived with low coulombic efficiency due to the polysulfide shuttle. We herein design carbon-coated NanoLi(2)S (NanoLi(2)S@carbon) composites, which consist of Li2S nanoparticles as the core and a carbon coating as the shell. The carbon shell prevents the NanoLi(2)S core from directly contacting the liquid electrolyte, which improves the performance of Li/S cells to provide longer cycle life and high sulfur utilization. The cyclability of Li/S cells is further enhanced by mixing the core-shell NanoLi(2)S carbon composites with graphene oxide, which chemically immobilizes polysulfides in the cathode through their functional groups. The resulting Li/S cell shows an initial specific discharge capacity of 1263 mAh g(-1) (normalized to sulfur) at the C/10 rate and a capacity retention of 65.4% after 200 cycles. The capacity decay mechanism during cycling is also characterized in detail using near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It still cannot be applied because of some key problems. In particular, the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide compounds leads to the rapid attenuation of battery capacity, short cycle life and serious self-discharge effect. TiO2 quantum dots and polysulfide compounds have strong interactions and can capture soluble polysulfide compounds, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect. Herein, we introduce a battery separator based on TiO2 quantum dots modified multi walled carbon nanotubes to solve the shuttle effect and adapt to the expansion of electrodes during charging and discharging. The interlayer has abundant spacing and excellent conductivity. This strategy can significantly improve the stability of lithium sulfur batteries. As a result, Li-S cells with MWCNTs@TiO2 quantum dots modified separator deliver an initial capacity of 1083mAh g(-1) and keep a cycle capacity of 610 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles at the rate of 838 mA g(-1), which maintains an average capacity decay of only 0.072% per cycle. This simple and effective method can greatly improve the application capacity of lithium sulfur batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The RGO/C-Co-S cathode exhibits greatly improved electrochemical performance, showing excellent specific capacity of 949 mAh g(-1) at 300th cycle at a current density 0.3 A g(-1), displaying enhanced rate capability with specific capacity of 772, 704 and 606 mAh g(-1) at current density of 0.5, 1 and 2 A g(-1), respectively. The synergetic effect of MOFs-derived porous carbon, homogeneously distributed Co nanoparticles and RGO nanosheets simultaneously contributes to the confinement of sulfur species. The presence of abundant mesopores and micropores is conducive to immobilize large amounts of S species. The homogenously inlaid ultrafine Co nanoparticles can further immobilize sulfur by chemical interactions between Co and S/polysulfides. The RGO nanosheets tightly wrapped on carbon hosts act as barrier layers to prevent polysulfides from diffusing out of the matrix, further suppressing shuttle effect. The porous structure and the RGO can effectively alleviate the volume changes resulted from charge-discharge process. This design strategy can be inspiring for MOF-derived materials in energy storage applications. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although many material solutions (such as sulfurized polyacrylonitrile or SPAN) have been identified for alleviating polysulfide formation and the so-called shuttle effect, their incorporation into 3D current collectors with high capacity at the electrode level has not yet been realized. Here, we show that graphene foams (GFs) are ideally suited as 3D lightweight current collectors for LSBs and outperform the conventional carbon-coated Al (Al/C) foils at the electrode level. Specifically, we demonstrate that the open framework of GFs facilitates high mass loading of SPAN without any deterioration in capacity at the active material level even at high S loading. At the electrode level, GF-SPAN cathodes exhibited capacities of similar to 200 mAh g(electrode)(-1) at 0.1C even with low S loadings (similar to 1.1 mg cm(-2)), which is at least 3 times higher than conventional Al/C electrodes. More importantly, we fabricated cells with a high mass loading of 26.5 mg cm(-2) S by stacking multiple GFs to achieve an areal capacity as high as similar to 20 mAh cm(-2) (at a current density of 3.0 mA cm(-2) up to 50 cycles), which is at least 3 times higher than LSB areal capacity (6 mAh cm(-2)) needed to displace LIBs.

To overcome such problems, carbon nano tubes (CNTs) and graphitic nano fibers (GNFs) were added into the sulfur electrode. The addition of CNTs and GNFs having a network-like structure is expected to offer the structural stability and good electrical path of sulfur electrode. The morphology of fabricated sulfur electrode was observed by using scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the crystalline structure was characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The charge/discharge tests were conducted in the voltage range 3.2/1.5V (vs.Li) with a galvanostatic method.

However, the poor electrical conductivity and volumetric expansion of sulfur along with the dissolution of lithium polysulfides largely limit their practical application. In this study, nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (NGA) with high nitrogen content and porosity is used as a host for the impregnation of sulfur. The effects of sulfur impregnation on the specific surface area, pore volume, and microstructure of NGA supported sulfur composite (S@NGA) are well investigated. Furthermore, NGA is also processed into a NGA film, which is sandwiched between a separator and S@NGA cathode. The lithium-sulfur battery with such a configuration delivers a high reversible capacity of 1514 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, excellent rate performance (822 mA h g(-1) at 2.0 C), and good cycling stability (946 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C even after 100 cycles). The enhanced electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the introduction of the NGA interlayer, the unique interconnected porous structure, and strong interaction between the three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene network and the homogeneously dispersed sulfur and/or lithium polysulfides.

However, their commercialization confronts great challenges, in particular the notorious shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics, making it difficult to realize high sulfur loading and cell energy density properties. Herein, we explore the potential of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as the cathode catalyst to promote the polysulfide conversion. Nanosized Mo2C embedded porous carbon network (Mo2C@PCN) are prepared through the pyrolysis of molybdenum and chitosan precursor. Both electrochemical performance and theoretical calculations reveal that introducing the Mo2C can not only enhance the affinity toward the polysulfide intermediate, but also significantly accelerate the polysulfide interconversion compared with that of the pristine porous carbon network (PCN), thereby endowing the Li-S batteries with excellent cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.034 % per cycle over 600 cycles, and superb rate capability of 644 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment	[Deng, Shungui; Shi, Xiaotang; Zhao, Yue; Wang, Chao; Wu, Jinghua; Yao, Xiayin] Chinese Acad Sci, Ningbo Inst Mat Technol & Engn, Ningbo 315201, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jinghua; Yao, Xiayin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Mat Sci & Optoelect Engn, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China		Wu, JH; Yao, XY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ningbo Inst Mat Technol & Engn, Ningbo 315201, Peoples R China.	wujh@nimte.ac.cn; yaoxy@nimte.ac.cn	Yao, Xiayin/P-3690-2014		National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB0905400]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1964205, 51872303, 51902321, 52172253]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LD18E020004]; Ningbo S&T Innovation 2025 Major Special Programme [2018B10061, 2018B10087, 2019B10044]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2017342]	National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Ningbo S&T Innovation 2025 Major Special Programme; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS	The work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant no. 2018YFB0905400), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no.

However, insulation of S and dissolution of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte lead to low utilization of sulfur and poor cycling performance, which seriously hamper the rapid development of Li-S batteries. Herein, we reported that encapsulating sulfur into hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) derived from the soluble starch with a template of needle-like nanosized Mg(OH)(2). HPC has a relatively high specific surface area of 902.5 m(2) g(-1) and large total pore volume of 2.60 cm(3) g(-1) resulting that a weight percent of sulfur in S/HPC is up to 84 wt %. When evaluated as cathodes for Li-S batteries, the S/HPC composite has a high discharge capacity of 1249 mAh g(-1) in the first cycle and a Coulombic efficiency as high as 94% with stable cycling over prolonged 100 charge/discharge cycles at a high current density of 1675 mA g(-1). The superior electrochemical performance of S/HPC is closely related to its unique structure, exhibiting the graphitic structure with a high developed porosity framework of macropores in combination with mesopores and micropores. Such nanostructure could shorten the transport pathway for both ions and electrons during prolonged cycling.

To address these issues, here we report the design and synthesis of polypyrrole coated sulfur and cobalt co-doped carbon nanocages (PSCC). It demonstrates that both the performance and stability of the PSCC assisted Li-S batteries are improved. The hollow structure of PSCC bypassed the structural collapse effectively caused by volume expansion of sulfur during the reaction and physically suppressed shuttle effect of the intermediate product polysulfide lithium (LiPSs). Also, LiPSs was also trapped to inhibit the shuttle effect due to the strong adsorption of LiPSs via PSCC. In addition, PSCC can also provide an outstanding electronic conductivity, which will facilitate the next-step reaction of the absorbed LiPSs and enhance electrochemical reaction kinetics. Thus, the excellent rate performance was obtained with high specific discharge capacities of 1300 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 1000 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C. Such packaged high-performance positions our design for the ideal electrochemical energy storage devices.

However, their practical application remains a challenge because of the serve shuttle effect caused by the dissolution,of polysulfides in common organic electrolytes. Polysulfide-insoluble electrolytes, such as solvate ionic liquids (ILs), have recently emerged as alternative candidates and shown great potential in suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the cycle stability of Li-S batteries. Redox electrochemical reactions in polysulfide-insoluble electrolytes occur via a solid-state process at the interphase between the electrolyte and the composite cathode; therefore, creating an appropriate interface between sulfur and a carbon support is Of :great importance. Nevertheless, the porous carbon supports established. for conventional Organic electrolytes may not be suitable for polysulfide-insoluble electrolytes. In this work, we investigated the effect of the porous structure of carbon materials on the Li-S battery performance in polysulfide-insoluble electrolytes using solvate ILs as model electrolyte. We determined that the, pore volume (rather than the surface area) exerts a major influence on the discharge capacity of S composite cathodes. In particular, inverse opal carbons with three-dimensionally ordered interconnected macropores and a large pore volume deliver the highest discharge capacity. The battery performance in both polysulfide-soluble electrolytes and solvate ILs was used to study the, affect of electrolytes. We propose a plausible mechanism to explain the different porous structure requirements polysulfide-soluble and polysulfide-insoluble electrolytes.

This composite was used as the sulfur electrode for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, exhibiting high capacity, good rate capability, and excellent cyclability. The electrode containing 69.0% (by weight, wt%) sulfur delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1113.2 mA h g(-1) and 989.2 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.3%. Its capacity retention at 2 C was measured to be 62% with respect to the capacity achieved at 0.2 C. The high-performance of this electrode in Li-S batteries can be attributed to the porous carbon infrastructure, inherent nitrogen-doping and graphene protection. Taking into account the low-cost of raw materials and easy scalable processes, this work features a promising approach to prepare sulfur/carbon composites for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Beside the dissolution of lithium polysulfides, volume expansion during lithiation and insulation nature of sulfur, which lead to low sulfur utilization, the irreversible phase transformation of the final discharge product Li2S is considered as one predominant reason for capacity fading of lithium-sulfur batteries. The effective activation of Li2S is the key to improve the cycling stability. Herein, we develop a cost-effective method to synthesize N-doped nanoflakes with tunable nitrogen structures and controllable concentrations. Activation experiments confirm that N-doped carbon can reduce the activation energy to accelerate the Li2S conversion for the first time. The pyridinic N doped carbon exhibits not only the strongest capture ability of the lithium polysulfides but also the lowest dissociated energy of Li2S. Moreover, theoretical and experimental evidence prove that the activity site is electron-withdrawing pyridinic N. The cathodes based on pyridinic N doped carbon display higher capacity and better cycling stability.

Herein, we developed a hierarchically fibrous framework to establish a conducive, adsorptive, and catalytic barrier toward inhibition on polysulfide shuttling and enhancement in Li-S battery performance. The weaving carbonaceous scaffold with vertically-rooted carbon nanofiber (CNF) tentacles facilitates both short- and long-range electrical conduction as well as efficient exposure of active sites, while the multiple adsorptive and catalytic sites enable strong sulfur confinement and expedited sulfur conversion, thus contributing to a fast and durable sulfur electrochemistry. Attributed to these favorable features, Li-S cells based on the as-developed interlayer achieve excellent cyclability with minimum capacity fading rate of 0.018% over 1000 cycles, high rate capability up to 3 C, and decent performance under high raised sulfur loading up to 8 mg cm(-2).

However, shuttle of soluble polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics in sulfur cathode still limit its practical application. Herein, a hollow porous B, N-codoped graphitic carbon-Co composite (h-Co-BN-GC) is synthesized, combining the advantages of synergetic structural and chemical bonding confinement to reserve the soluble polysulfides. A serial of further electrochemical redox kinetic studies confirm that the ultrafine Co nanoparticles and B, N-codoped species serve as dual electrocatalysts, substantially promote the redox of polysulfides reaction kinetics. Benefiting from the above merits, the as-obtained 80S@h-Co-BN-GC composite demonstrates an improved electrochemical performance. It delivers a high first discharge capacity of 1089 mAh g(-1) and remarkable capacity retention of 877 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C rate, with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency maintenance. These results suggest that the 80S@h-Co-BN-GC composite provides possibility of practical applications in high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cerium oxide (CeO2) has remarkable polysulfide adsorption capability and has been recently investigated in lithium sulfur battery application. With the goal of bridging towards commercialization of lithium sulfur battery, cellulose paper derived carbon fiber decorated with CeO2 nanorods using hydrothermal method has been fabricated and used as interlayer material for lithium sulfur battery. In this novel design, the carbon fiber provides physical confinement with its 3-D interconnected conductive structure and CeO2 adsorbs lithium polysulfides chemically to reduce shuttle effect to achieve long lifetime and high capacity for lithium sulfur battery. With a sulfur content of 2 mg, a high capacity of 1177 mAhg = 1 was achieved at 0.2C with an excellent stability of only 0.11% capacity decay per cycle over 300 cycles. The improved performance is attributed to the binding of lithium polysulfides by CeO2 and the blocking of polysulfides physically by the compact conducting carbon fiber. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, a functionally designed SiO2 tethered 1-methyl-1-propylpiperidinium chloride (SiO2-PPCl) ionic liquid nanoparticle is adopted as a bridgebuilder between the carbon carrier and lithium polysulfides (LPS) to modulate shuttle issues. The SiO2-PPCl exerts effective adhesion to both polar LPS and nonpolar carbon carrier material by its special function groups, which make it act as a bridge between them, therefore, the dissolved LPS are prevented from migrating to lithium anode effectively, and the corresponding LPS shuttle is controllable by simply tuning the ratio of SiO2-PPCl to sulfur. This strategy is demonstrated in a lithium sulfur suspension flow cell in which the shuttle effect is more serious because large quantity of electrolyte is adopted, and over 1000 cycles is achieved with high coulombic efficiency of 99%. Verified in a laboratory flow cell equipment, the approach of exploiting polysulfides bridgebuilder to control LPS shuttle manifests its feasibility and offers a new direction to develop lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, their practical application is still hindered by the sluggish kinetics and low reversibility of the conversion reactions, which contribute to relatively low practical capacity, Coulombic inefficiency, and cycling instability. In this regard, the rational design of conductive, adsorptive and catalytic functional materials presents a critical pathway to stabilize and promote sulfur electrochemistry. Benefiting from the unique atomic and electronic structures of boron, boron-based materials exhibit multifarious and tunable physical, chemical and electrochemical properties, and have received extensive research attentions in Li-S batteries.

Owing to the strong electrostatic interactions between the opposite charged materials, the coating agents are very stable and the coating procedure is highly efficient. The LBL film shows prominent impact on the stability of the cathode by acting as not only a basic physical barrier, and more importantly, an ion-permselective film to block the polysulfides anions by Coulombic repulsion. Furthermore, the graphene sheets can help to stabilize the polyelectrolytes film and greatly reduce the inner resistance of the electrode by changing the transport of the electrons from a point-to-point mode to a more effective plane-to-point mode. On the basis of the synergistic effect of the PEMs and graphene sheets, the fabricated composite electrode exhibits very stable cycling stability for over 200 cycles at 1 A g-1, along with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99%. With the advantages of rapid and controllable fabrication of the LBL coating film, the multifunctional architecture developed in this study should inspire the design of other lithium-sulfur cathodes with unique physical and chemical properties.

However, the poor conductivity of sulfur and Li2S, as well as the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides, seriously limits their commercialization. Herein, cobalt chalcogenides (Co3O4, CoS, and Co3Se4) supported by reduced graphene oxide are synthesized as the electrode materials, which feature high conductivity, rapid kinetic conversion, and catalytic effect. Based on complementary experimental outputs and advanced computation, it is revealed that the change in anion results in distinctive performance. Among them, the cathode material based on Co3Se4/reduced graphene oxide is the best. The reasons can be ascribed to the conductive and catalytic improvement. This comparative study provides guidelines in the design of lithium-sulfur batteries via the meticulous regulation of the anions.

Herein, the polysulfide shuttle was tuned by the loading of sulfur and electrolyte in a Li-S cell. A lithium-sulfur cell with a high initial discharge capacity of 1053 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 1 C and an ultralow decay rate of 0.049%/per cycle during 1000 cycles was obtained by using carbon nanotube@sulfur cathode and suppressing polysulfide shuttle to a shuttle factor of 0.02 by matching the sulfur/electrolyte loading. The use of matching the sulfur/electrolyte loading is a facile way to tune the shuttle of polysulfide, which provides not only new insights to the energy chemistry of Li/S batteries, but also important principle to assemble a Li/S cell with recommend loading for their commercialization application in portable mobile devices and electric vehicles.

Herein, we designed various interlayers and understand the working mechanism of an interlayer for lithium sulfur batteries in detail. It was found that the electrochemical performance of a S electrode for an interlayer located in cathode side is superior to the pristine one without interlayers. Surprisingly, the performance of the S electrode for an interlayer located in anode side is poorer than that of pristine one. For comparison, glass fibers were also studied as a nonconductive interlayer for lithium sulfur batteries. Unlike the two interlayers above, these nonconductive interlayer did displays significant capacity fading because polysulfides were adsorbed onto insulated interlayer. Thus, the nonconductive interlayer function as a "dead zone" upon cycling. Based on our findings, it was for the first time proposed that a controllably optimized interlayer, with electrical conductivity as well as the absorbability of polysulfides, may function as a "vice-electrode" of the anode or cathode upon cycling. Therefore, the cathodic conductive interlayer can enhance lithium sulfur battery performance, and the anodic conductive interlayer may be helpful for the rational design of 3D networks for the protection of lithium metal.

Although plausible advances have been made on the performances of the composite cathode with high sulfur loading, the development of compatible protection strategies for lithium anode is seriously lagging behind. Here we report a new strategy to suppress the dendrite growth in lithium-sulfur batteries with high sulfur loading by introducing graphene quantum dots into the electrolyte. The graphene quantum dots serve as the heterogeneous sites for uniform nucleation and provide continual regulation for the dendrite-free lithium deposition. The in-situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the enrichment of the GQDs at the electrode-electrolyte interface for the regulated electric field and ion flux, resulting in the dendrite-free Li deposition. As a result, the critical current of short circuit induced by lithium dendrite increases up to 7.44 mA cm(-2), and the soft-short risk is excluded when cycling at the current density of 3 mA cm(-2) with areal capacity of 3 mAh cm(-2) for more than 500 h, demonstrating the excellent dendrite suppressing action of the GQDs. As a proof of concept, high-loading lithium-sulfur batteries using the GQDs-modified anolyte are fabricated with stable Coulombic efficiency of 99% at the current density of 3 mA cm(-2) with sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2) over 200 cycles. Our results provide a novel and facile approach to tackle the intrinsic problem on the lithium anode for high-loading lithium-sulfur batteries.

In such a solution-based assembly process, the formation of an interconnected graphene/CNT conductive network is accompanied by the uniform loading of sulfur, whose fraction is as high as of 70 wt%. The as-prepared GCS hybrid delivers an initial capacity of '1008 mAh g-1 at 03C and maintains 704 mAh g(-1), after 100 cycles. Remarkably, at a high rate of 1.0C, the cathode shows an excellent cyclic performance with a capacity of 657 mAh g(-1) after 450 ycles and the capacity decay is only 0.04% per cycle. Moreover, the superior rate performance of GCS hybrid is attributed to the conductive network formed by interconnected graphene sheets and CNT, which supply an unimpeded and continuous path for electron and Li ion transfer and accommodate the volume variation of sulfur during charge/discharge cycling. In addition, the residual functional groups on GCS can retain intimate contact of the conducting matrix with sulfur and effectively confine the diffusion of polysulfides. This study gives an eco-friendly and highly effective solution-based approach for carbon sulfur electrode for lithium sulfur battery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In our study, peapodlike mesoporous carbon with interconnected pore channels and large pore volume (4.69 cm(3) g(-1)) was synthesized and used as the matrix to fabricate carbon/sulfur (C/S) composite which served as attractive cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries. Systematic investigation of the C/S composite reveals that the carbon matrix can hold a high but suitable sulfur loading of 84 wt %, which is beneficial for improving the bulk density in practical application. Such controllable sulfur-filling also effectively allows the volume expansion of active sulfur during Li+ insertion. Moreover, the thin carbon walls (3-4 nm) of carbon matrix not only are able to shorten the pathway of Li+ transfer and conduct electron to overcome the poor kinetics of sulfur cathode, but also are flexible to warrant structure stability. Importantly, the peapodlike carbon shell is beneficial to increase the electrical contact for improving electronic conductivity of active sulfur. Meanwhile, polymer modification with polypyrrole coating layer further restrains polysulfides dissolution and improves the cycle stability of carbon/sulfur composites.

In the present study, a flexible twodimensional interlayer consists of ZIF-7 metal organic framework sheet rooted on carbon fiber (ZIF-7@CNF) was successfully fabricated. This ZIF-7@CNF interlayer not only works as a physical barrier for LiPs, the ZIF-7 flake also exposes a large number of active sites for LiPs adsorption. When stalked on the conductive CNF network, three dimensional channels for electron/ion transfer were formed, which also accelerates the transformation of LiPs. Due to these beneficial features, the Li-S batteries with this ZIF-7@CNF interlayer achieves an excellent discharge specific capacity (1226.9 mAh g(-1)) at 0.2 C with a high capacity retention rate of 89% after 100 cycles, a areal capacity of 3.92 mAh cm(-2) under a sulfur loading of 6.37 mg cm(-2).

However, the weak binding energy of carbon with sulfur species causes poor cycle performance. We report that amine- and hydroxyl-rich biopolymer (chitosan) coated on ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) can effectively capture soluble polysulfide. The strong binding of chitosan's amine- and hydroxyl-group with the polysulfides prevents dissolution of soluble intermediates and assists dispersion of insulating final products. In addition, as chitosan is insoluble in the electrolyte, chitosan coating on the cathode sustainably increases cycle stability and coulombic efficiency of Li-S batteries. Initial coulombic efficiency of chitosan modified OMC/S composite was 81.7% and specific capacities of chitosan modified OMC/S composite were 32.4% and 51.6% higher than those of bare OMC/S composite at 100(th) and 140(th) cycle, respectively.

Herein, a multifunctional sulfur host of N/S co-doped porous graphene layered matrix (NSPG) is fabricated. High specific surface area of NSPG can guarantee the homogeneous deposition and high utilization of S/Li2S. Moreover, the layered graphene skeleton with abundant crumples can not only construct efficient channels for fast electrolyte ion/electron transfer but also effectively buffer the volume expansion of S during long-time charge/discharge process. DFT calculations verify that the N/S co-doping can promote the redox reaction rate and inhibit the polysulfides shuttle effect through chemical bonding interaction. Benefiting from the above synergistic effects, the NSPG/S electrode exhibits excellent rate performance (646 mAh g(-1) at 10C) and outstanding cycle stability (693 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles). Even at a high mass loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2), a capacity of 786 mAh g(-1) can be retained after 100 cycles. This work might offer a feasible solution for developing sulfur host with multifunctionality and electrocatalytic activity for high-performance lithium sulfur batteries.

However, the low conductivity of the sulfur cathode and its shuttling effects are still a challenge for the energy-storage system. In this work, we describe a potential solution to address this challenge, using carbon nanospheres encapsulated in a tungsten nitride (WN) layer, interconnected with WN nanorods. After successfully synthesizing this composite in situ by using a straightforward method, we applied it as the sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries. The results demonstrate a strong chemical trapping ability of the WN shell towards lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and a strong electron-transfer ability of the WN nanorods. Together, these effects alleviate LiPSs ' shuttling from carbon nanospheres (CNS) and give rise to a high sulfur content (70 wt %) in the as-prepared S/WN-CNS material. When compared to traditional S/N-CNS electrodes, the tuned S/WN-CNS cathodes deliver an outstanding electrochemical performance, including a high initial capacity of 1351 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and superior long-term cycling stability with 80 % retention of the initial capacity with 3 mg cm(-2) after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. As such, a high specific capacity, excellent rate capacity, and long cycling stability are achieved. Our approach provides a path to a broad class of high-performance Li-S battery applications based on nanostructured WN materials.

However, their practical performance is seriously restricted due to the undesired polysulfides shuttling. Herein, a multifunctional interlayer composed of paper-derived carbon (PC) scaffold, Fe3O4 nanoparticles, graphene, and graphite sheets is designed for applications in LSBs. The porous PC skeleton formed by the interweaving long-fibers not only facilitates fast transfer of Li ions and electrons but also provides a physical barrier for the polysulfide shuttling. The secondary Fe3O4 @graphene component can reduce the polarization, boost the attachment of polysulfides, and promote the charging-discharging kinetics. The outer graphitic sheets layers benefit the interfacial electrochemistry and the utilization of S-containing species. The efficient obstruction of polysulfides diffusion is further witnessed via in situ ultraviolet-visible characterization and first-principles simulations. When 73% sulfur/commercial acetylene black is used as the cathode, the cell exhibits excellent capacity retention with high capacities at 0.5 C for 10 0 0 cycles and even up to 10 C for 500 cycles, an ultrahigh rate capability up to 10 C (478 mAh g(-1)), and a high areal sulfur loading of 8.05 mg cm(-2). The strategy paves the way for developing multifunctional composites for LSBs with superior performance. (c) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

PVP-Assisted Synthesis of Uniform Carbon Coated Li2S/CB for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						lithium sulfide; core-shell; lithium-sulfur batteries; cycled cells; post testing	NITROGEN-DOPED CARBON; CATHODE MATERIAL; ION BATTERIES; CAPACITY; GRAPHENE; LI; NANOSHEETS; ELECTRODE; STORAGE; ANODE	The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is a great alternative to the state-of-the-art lithium ion batteries due to its high energy density. However, low utilization of active materials, the insulating nature of sulfur or lithium sulfide (Li2S), and polysulfide dissolution in organic liquid electrolyte lead to low initial capacity and fast performance degradation. Herein, we propose a facile and viable approach to address these issues. This new approach entails synthesis of Li2S/carbon black (Li2S/CB) cores encapsulated by a nitrogen-doped carbon shell with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) assistance. Combining energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) elemental mappings, XPS and FTIR measurements, it is confirmed that the as-synthesized material has a structure of a Li2S/CB core with a nitrogen-doped carbon shell (denoted as Li2S/CB@NC). The Li2S/CB@NC cathode yields an exceptionally high initial capacity of 1020 mAh/g based on Li2S mass at 0.1 C with stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 200 cycles. Also, cycling performance shows the capacity decay per cycle as small as 0.17%. Most importantly, to further understand the materials for battery applications, field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) and elemental mapping tests without exposure to air for Li2S samples in cycled cells are reported. Along with the first ever FETEM and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) investigations of cycled batteries, Li2S/CB@NC cathode demonstrates the capability of robust core-shell nanostructures for different rates and improved capacity retention, revealing Li2S/CB@NC designed here as an outstanding system for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries can be achieved only when the major barriers, including the shuttling effect of polysulfides (Li2Sx, x = 3-8), significant volume change (similar to 80%), and the resultant rapid deterioration of electrodes, are tackled. Here, we propose an inside-out synthesis strategy by mimicking the structure of the pomegranate fruit to achieve conductive confinement of sulfur to address these issues. In the proposed pomegranate-like structure, sulfur and carbon nanotubes composite is encapsulated by the in situ formed amorphous carbon network, which allows the regeneration of electroactive material sulfur and the confinement of the sulfur as well as the lithium polysulfide within the electrical conductive carbon network. Consequently, a highly robust sulfur cathode is obtained, delivering remarkable performance in a Li-S battery. The obtained composite cathode shows a reversible capacity of 691 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles with impressive cycle stability at the current density of 1600 mA g(-1).

Herein, bipyramidal sulfur/graphene oxide composite cathode with sulfur content of 92% is obtained via a room-temperature bottom-up approach with the aid of polyvinylpyrrolidone. Material characterization reveals the uniform coating of each individual sulfur particle by a thin wall of graphene oxide and residual polyvinylpyrrolidone molecules. The robustness and close proximity of the protective graphene oxide shell not only facilitates electron and ion transportation but also restrains the diffusion of polysulfides through interfacial chemical interaction. As a result, the cathode manifests a high initial reversible capacity of 1301 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, outstanding capacity retention of 86.4% at 1 C after 115 cycles and long cycle life of 250 cycles with 360.6 mAh g(-1) remaining capacity at 2 C. The present work provides an affordable and sustainable approach of confining sulfur at high content which is essential for high-energy density lithium-sulfur battery.

It is found that a part of spherical sulfur particles are located in the voids formed by the intertwined fibers and the others are confined in hollow channel of the HCF. The high conductive and porous HCF favors the construction of stable three-dimensional conducting network and convenient infiltration of the electrolytes into the cathode. The HCF-S cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in the electrolyte with LiNO3. By contrast, the ionic liquid electrolyte provides insufficient shuttle suppression and weakens ion transport, which leads to poor cycle and rate capability.

One strategy is absorbing the LiPSs by modifying separator of Li-S batteries. Herein, we show a novel nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon (NGC) derived from coconut shell, which was annealed by flash Joule heating at ultrahigh temperature within seconds. The NGC was coated on the polypropylene (PP) separator to prepare the modified PP separator, which enabled the Li-S batteries to work stably at 1 C with a low fading rate of 0.09 % from 788 mAh g(-1). Microscopy analysis and Raman spectrum reveal that the high-graphitization carbon with heavily nitrogen-doping strengthens the adsorption of LiPSs in the charge/discharge process.

The nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous coralloid carbon (N-HPCC) with an appropriate nitrogen content (1.29 wt%) was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach, combined with subsequent carbonization-activation. The N-HPCC/S composites prepared by a simple melt-diffusion method displayed an excellent electrochemical performance. With a high sulfur content (58 wt%) in the total electrode weight, the N-HPCC/S cathode delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 1626.8mAh g(-1) and remained high up to 1086.3mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 100mA g(-1), which is about 1.86 times as that of activated carbon. Particularly, the reversible discharge capacity still maintained 607.2mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles even at a higher rate of 800mAg(-1). The enhanced electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergetic effect between the intriguing hierarchically porous coralloid structure and appropriate nitrogen doping, which could effectively trap polysulfides, alleviate the volume expansion, enhance the electronic conductivity and improve the surface interaction between the carbon matrix and polysulfides.

Herein, the sustainable and environmentally friendly porous carbon aerogel is prepared through hydrothermal treatment, freeze-drying, and postpyrolysis using sweet potato as the precursor. The as-prepared carbon aerogel is used to modify the commercial separator of lithium sulfur batteries to solve the problems of poor cycle life and low utilization rate of active substances. The carbon aerogel coating can not only suppress the shuttle effect of the polysulfide intermediates during cycling and reduce the cell resistance but also act as an upper current collector to increase the utilization rate of sulfur. The cell with carbon aerogel modified separator exhibits high electrochemical performance. The results show that the initial discharge capacity is 1216 mAh/g at 0.1 after 1000 cycles at 1 C and the reversible discharge capacity retains 431 mAh/g with the Coulombic efficiency over 95.3%.

For practical viability, reasonable active-material loading of >4.0 mg cm(-2) must be employed, at a cost to the intrinsic instability of sulfur cathodes. The incursion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) at higher sulfur loadings results in low active material utilization and poor cell cycling capability. The use of high-surface-area hierarchical macro/mesoporous inverse opal (IOP) carbons to investigate the effects of pore volume and surface area on the electrochemical stability of high-loading, high-thickness cathodes for Li-S batteries is presented here. The IOP carbons are additionally doped with pyrrolic-type nitrogen groups (N-IOP) to act as a polar polysulfide mediator and enhance the active-material reutilization. With a high sulfur loading of 6.0 mg cm(-2), the Li-S cells assembled with IOP and N-IOP carbons are able to attain a high specific capacity of, respectively, 1242 and 1162 mA h g(-1). The N-IOP enables the Li-S cells to demonstrate good electrochemical performance over 300 cycles.

The CL that is covered on the pure sulfur cathode effectively suppresses the polysulfide shuttling mechanism and enables the use of pure sulfur as the cathode. A low charge resistance and a high discharge capacity of 1320mAhg(-1) arise from the improved cell conductivity due to the innately integral conductive carbon network of the CL. The unique microstructure of CL leads to a high discharge/charge efficiency of >98%, low capacity fade of 0.18% per cycle, and good long-term cyclability over 150cycles. The structural gradient and the micro/mesoporous adsorption sites of CL effectively intercept/trap the migrating polysulfides and facilitate their reutilization. The green CL polysulfide diffusion inhibitor thus offers a viable approach for developing high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

It is a main challenge to develop long-term cycling stability battery. Here, a catalytic strategy is presented to accelerate reversible transformation of sulfur and its discharge products in lithium-sulfur batteries. This is achieved with single-atomic iron active sites in porous nitrogen-doped carbon, prepared by polymerizing and carbonizing diphenylamine in the presence of iron phthalocyanine and a hard template. The Fe-PNC/S composite electrode exhibited a high discharge capacity (427 mAh g(-1)) at a 0.1C rate after 300 cycles with the Columbic efficiency of above 95.6%. Besides, the electrode delivers much higher capacity of 557.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C over 300 cycles. Importantly, the Fe-PCN/S has a smaller phase nucleation overpotential of polysulfides than nitrogen-doped carbon alone for the formation of nanoscale of Li2S as revealed by ex situ SEM, which enhance lithium-ion diffusion in Li2S, and therefore a high rate performance and remarkable cycle life of Li-sulfur batteries were achieved. Our strategy paves a new way for polysulfide conversion with atomic iron catalysis to exploit high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

It is of significant importance to rationally design and tune their porous structure and active sites for achieving high electrochemical activity and stability. Herein, we develop a novel approach to tune the morphology of porous carbon materials (PCM) by embedding fullerene C-60, achieving improved performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. Owing to the strong interaction between C-60 and imidazole moieties, pomegranate-like hybrid of C-60-embedded zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) precursor is synthesized, which is further pyrolyzed to form C-60-embedded cobalt/nitrogen-codoped porous carbon materials (abbreviated as C-60@Co-N-PCM). Remarkably, the unique structure of C-60@Co-N-PCM offers excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline solutions, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%) catalyst. Besides, C-60@Co-N-PCM as a novel cathode delivers a high specific capacity of similar to 900 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.2 C rate in Li-S batteries, which is superior to the pristine ZIF-67-derived PCM without embedding C-60.

The obtained mesoporous carbon presented a well-defined mesopore structure with high surface area and large mesopore size. During synthesis, MCC underwent structural relaxation process before degradation, which could provide a capillarity condensation force inducing the imprint of mesopore on final carbons. Due to the proper structure, the as-prepared mesoporous carbon showed prominent performance as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, exhibiting a high reversible capacity of 860 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C after 200 cycles, and exceptional rate capability with 600 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 C.

Herein, carbon materials with rational tailoring of morphology and pores were designed for strong loading/adsorption with the controlling of energy-storage ability. Through rational tailoring, it is strongly verified that such engineering of evolutions result in variational of sulfur immobilization in the obtained carbon. As expected, the targeted sample delivers a stable capacity of 925 mAh g(-1) after 100 loops. Supporting by the ''cutting-off" manners, it is disclosed that mesopores in carbon possess more fascinated traits than micro/macropores in improving the utilization of sulfur and restraining Li2Sx (4 <= x <= 8). Moreover, the long-chain polysulfide could be further consolidated by auto-doping oxygen groups. Supported by in-depth kinetic analysis, it is confirmed that the kinetics of ion/e(-) transfer during charging and discharging could be accelerated by mesopores, especially in stages of the formation of solid S8 and Li2S, further improving the capacity of ion-storage in Li-S battery. Given this, the elaborate study provide significant insights into the effect of pore structure on kinetic performance about Li-storage behaviors in Li-S battery, and give guidance for improving sulfur immobilization.

The doped materials with interconnected pore structure of CA and evenly dispersed Nd2O3 offer crucial confinement role to anchor sulfur and suppress the loss of polysulfide ions for interrelate function of S/polysulfides by Nd2O3. The composited sulfur electrodes present high electrochemical performances and initial discharge capacities, especially, the Nd2-CA/S sample gains initial discharge capacity of 1327 inAh g at 0.2 C and remains at 1082 mAh g 1 after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, it still remains capacity of about 907 mAh g at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performances can be ascribed to the crosslink mesoporous CA materials and well distributed neodymium oxide. Furthermore, the metal additive also takes promoting effect on redox reactions of the Li/S batteries presenting higher discharge voltages.

This study reports 3D porous MOF@carbon nanotube (CNT) networks by grafting MOFs with tailored particle size uniformly throughout a CNT sponge skeleton. Growing larger-size MOF particles to entrap the conductive CNT network yields a mutually embedded structure with high stability, and after sulfur encapsulation, it shows an initial discharge capacity of approximate to 1380 mA h g(-1) (at 0.1 C) and excellent cycling stability with a very low fading rate. Furthermore, owing to the 3D porous network that is suitable for enhanced sulfur loading, a remarkable areal capacity of approximate to 11 mA h cm(-2) (at 0.1 C) is obtained, which is much higher than other MOF-based hybrid electrodes. The mutually embedded MOF@CNTs with simultaneously high specific capacity, areal capacity, and cycling stability represent an advanced candidate for developing high-performance Li-S batteries and other energy storage systems.

However, the sluggish redox kinetics of electrochemistry and high solubility of polysulfide during cycling render insufficient sulfur utilization and poor cycling stability. Herein, a facile, template-free procedure based on controlled pyrolysis of polydopamine vesicles is described to prepare N-doped porous carbon cages (NHSC) as a new sulfur host, which significantly improves both the sulfur utilization and cycling stability. As NHSC shows a high pore volume, continuous electron and ion transport paths, and good catalytic activity, encapsulation of S nanoparticles into NHSC endows the resulting S@NHSC electrode with a good energy storage capacity and exceptionally high electrochemical stability. Consequently, a Li-S cell with the S@NHSC as the cathode achieves a high initial capacity of 1280.7 mAh g(-1), and cycling stability over 500 cycles with the capacity decay as low as 0.0373% per cycle.

Herein, we develop a facile in-situ route to synthesize three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide supported Li2S/carbon composite (3D-rGO-Li2S/C). The Li2S/C nanoparticles are intimately anchored on the surface of 3D-rGO forming an integrated 3D porous composite. Due to the improved conductivity and reduced polysulftde dissolution, the 3D-rGO-Li2S/C cathode exhibits enhanced electrochemical performances with a high initial capacity of 819 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, as well as good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 415 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 1C.

Interlinked carbon nanoflakes have dual roles not only as a highly conductive matrix to host sulfur, but also act as blocking barriers to suppress the shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides. In the light of these positive characteristics, the obtained carbon nanoflake/S cathode exhibit good LSBs performances with high capacities (1117 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 degrees C, and 741 mAh g(-1) at 0.6 degrees C) and good high-rate cycling performance.

However, one of the dominant obstacles inhibiting the development and application of Li-S batteries is the "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). In the present work, the first-principles calculations were performed to investigate two-dimensional (2D) borophosphene as a new potential anchoring material for Li-S batteries. It was found that borophosphene is semimetallic with a Dirac cone, endowing it with excellent electrical conductance to expedite electron transport. In is of interest that, by combining the advantages of borophene and phosphorene, the planar and porous structure of borophosphene guarantees the strong binding and easy diffusion for LiPSs. It is significant that strain engineering can optimize the adsorption energy of highorder Li2Sn up to a moderate range to effectively suppress the shuttle effect by modifying the electronic properties of the anchoring materials and reduce the migration barrier to realize the rapid charge/discharge process for Li-S batteries. It is therefore conclusive that borophosphene could be used as the potential anchoring material for Li-S batteries.

The resulting T-Nb2O5 NWs//activated carbon SICs delivered a high energy density (106.2 Wh kg(-1)) and power density (4976 W kg(-1)). Thus-derived flexible SICs manifested excellent performances upon deformation, which was applicable for fast-charging wearable electronic sensors.

In present study, we report a facile in situ method to prepare sulfur@nitrogen-doped carbon (S@N-C) yolk@shell nanospheres (NSs) as cathodes for Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The In-situ synthesis strategy eliminates the problem of diffusion of LiPSs caused by sulfur accumulated on the outer surface of N-C. Moreover, the yolk@shell structure reduces volume expansion upon lithiation through internal hollow structure and provides physical confinement and chemical adsorption of LiPSs by enclosed N-C outer shell. In addition, the electronic conductivity and reaction kinetic rate increased due to the doped nitrogen. As expected, the S@N-C NSs cathodes exhibited superior electrochemical performance for Li-S batteries (616 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C after 500 cycles). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Basing on the solution thermodynamic analysis, the oxidation process of polysulfides to element sulfur would arise only if the charge voltage exceeds 3.36 V in a lithium-sulfur cell employing 1.0 M LiN(CF3SO2)(2) in 1,2-dimethoxy ethane. Furthermore, the minimum of charge voltage which can push the oxidation would fall down with the increasing solubility of elemental sulfur in electrolyte solution. These analyses were confirmed by practical measurements. One new anodic peak corresponding to the oxidation process of polysulfides to solid sulfur was observed by CV. Both XRD patterns and charge-discharge test showed that the element sulfur appeared in the cathode after the battery was charged over 3.4 V. Hence, the lithium-sulfur cell charged over 3.4 V exhibited an improved cycle life since the capacity degradation between the first cycle and the second was depressed. In order to improve the energy efficiency, carbon disulfide was added in the electrolyte solution of lithium-sulfur cell to increase the solubility of sulfur.

However, sulfur has limitations such as the formation of polysulfides and low conductivity. To overcome these problems, we prepared a cheese-like carbon (CLC) using a simple annealing process from an egg white. The as-prepared carbon material contains NaCl and KCl compounds. The CLC with nanoholes were formed after cleaning with distilled water and ethanol several times. The prepared CLC had a strong polysulfide capturing ability, high conductivity, a large surface area, and high catalytic activity. To prepare the CLC/S composite, sulfur was added by the melt diffusion method. CLC/S cathode material exhibited a high initial capacity of nearly 1420 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and excellent rate capability with a low capacity-fading rate. The present work revealed that CLC/S cathodes are potential candidate cathodes for Li-S batteries.	[Reddy, B.

Herein, we report a free-standing, compact, conductive and integrated cathode (G/CNT-S//G/CNT), constructed by compressing graphene/carbon nanotubes (G/CNT) aerogels, simultaneously serving as bi-functionalities of binder- and metal-current-collector-free sulfur host (G/CNT-S) and interlayer (G/CNT), for high volumetricenergy-density Li-S batteries. The G/CNT aerogels display three-dimensional interconnected porous network, large surface area (363 m(2) g(-1)) and high electrical conductivity (67 S m(-1)), which can endow the cathode with ultrahigh volumetric mass density (1.64 g cm(-3)) and superior electron-ion transport network. Meanwhile, the compressed ultralight G/CNT film can act as flexible interlayer for synergistically suppressing the polysulfide shuttling via both chemical interaction and physical restriction. Consequently, the compact cathodes, achieve high capacity of 1286 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and long-term cyclability with an extremely low decay rate of 0.06% over 500 cycles at 2 C. Most importantly, our compact cathodes represent unprecedented volumetric capacity of 1841 Ah L-1 and volumetric-energy-density of 2482 Wh L-1, both of which are the highest values of Li-S batteries reported to date. Therefore, this proposed strategy will open a new avenue for developing high volumetric-energy-density Li-S batteries.

Possible Causes of Lithium-Sulfur Battery Degradation	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						lithium-sulfur battery; lithium polysulfides; degradation during cycling	CARBON	To assess the possible degradation mechanisms of lithium-sulfur batteries during their cycling, cyclic voltammograms of sulfur electrode in normalized coordinates were analyzed. A capacity decrease at the low-voltage plateau is shown to correspond to the decrease in the active material amount, whereas decrease at the high-voltage plateau is characterized by a decrease in the reduction depth. The sulfur solubility in the dioxolane-dimethoxyethane mixture (1 : 1) is measured; it is about 0.2 M at room temperature. It is concluded that the shuttle transfer of polysulfides is not the only cause of the degradation: the transfer of dissolved sulfur also makes a significant contribution.	[Kulova, T. L.; Skundin, A.

Herein, we developed a highly efficient ion and electron conductive interlayer composed of Ti-2(SO4)(3) /carbon composite layer-coated Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)(3) (CLATP) and graphene to effectively block the diffusion of polysulfide anions but allow rapid Li ion transfer, therefore significantly inhibiting the self-discharge and boosting the cyclic stability of Li-S batteries. The Ti-2(SO4)(3)/carbon thin protective layer endows an optimized adsorption ability toward LiPSs and avoids the side reactions between LATP and LiPSs. The high electronic conductivity of graphene and high ionic conductivity of CLATP ensures the hybrid interlayer rapid electron and fast Li ion transport. As a result, the Li-S battery with the hybrid interlayer shows a high discharge capacity of 671 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with an extremely low capacity fading of 0.022% per cycle at 1 C. Moreover, the battery shows no self-discharge even after rest for 12 days. This work opens up a new way for the design of functional separators to significantly improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

Nevertheless, most sulfur electrodes suffer from insufficient cycle lives originating from dissolution of lithium polysulfides. As a fundamental solution to this chronic shortcoming, herein, we introduce a hierarchical porous carbon structure in which meso- and macropores are surrounded by outer micropores. Sulfur was infiltrated mainly into the inner meso- and macropores, while the outer micropores remained empty, thus serving as a "barricade" against outward dissolution of long-chain lithium polysulfides. On the basis of this systematic design, the sulfur electrode delivered 1412 mAh/g(sulfur) with excellent capacity retention of 77% after 500 cycles. Also, a control study suggests that even when sulfur is loaded into the outer micropores, the robust cycling performance is preserved by engaging small sulfur crystal structures (S2-4). Furthermore, the hierarchical porous carbon was produced in ultrahigh speed by scalable spray pyrolysis. Each porous carbon particle was synthesized through 5 s of carrier gas flow in a reaction tube.

A novel functional carbon composite (carbon-nanotube-interpenetrated mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon spheres, MNCS/CNT), which can strongly adsorb lithium polysulfides, is now reported to act as a sulfur host. The nitrogen functional groups of this composite enable the effective trapping of lithium polysulfides on electroactive sites within the cathode, leading to a much improved electrochemical performance (1200 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles). The enhancement in adsorption can be attributed to the chemical bonding of lithium ions by nitrogen functional groups in the MNCS/CNT framework. Furthermore, the micrometer-sized spherical structure of the material yields a high areal capacity (ca. 6 mAh cm(-2)) with a high sulfur loading of approximately 5 mg cm(-2), which is ideal for practical applications of the lithium-sulfur batteries.

Both served as sulfur host in Li-S batteries and showed outstanding electrochemical performances. By comparison, the importance of structure for high capacity and long cycle stability of lithium-sulfur battery is further illustrated. Application of lithium-sulfur battery has been limited due to polysulfide dissolution, the insulating nature of sulfur and the volumetric strain produced during charge and discharge process. To improve the performance of Li-S batteries, two kinds of bimetallic sulfides of NiCo2S4 with flaky (F-NiCo2S4) and sea urchin-like (S-NiCo2S4) structures were synthesized by using simple hydrothermal method, which were used as sulfur carriers in lithium-sulfur batteries and showed excellent electrochemical properties. At 0.2C, both electrodes of F-NiCo2S4/S and S-NiCo2S4/S have high pristine discharge specific capacities of 986mAhg-1 and 959mAhg-1. At high current density of 4C, the F-NiCo2S4/S electrode still has a high pristine discharge specific capacity of 673mAhg-1 and a coulombic efficiency of 97.00%. The specific capacity can remain at 526mAhg-1 with a low average attenuation of 0.17% even after 130 cycles.

Nevertheless, capacity fading and poor cycling stability mostly caused by polysulfide shuttle and active sulfur materials loss play an obstacle role on large-scale viable commercialization. In this paper, a flower-like hierarchical carbon sphere (FHCS) is prepared and coated on commercialized PP separator for polysulfide trapper. This carbon sphere with multi-scale pores strongly absorbs the polysulfide, further tremendously enhances the cycling performances, and the conducted carbon sphere also acts as current collector for improving the conductivity of active materials. The results show the cell demonstrates an initial discharge specific capacity of up to 1427 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, and high reversible capacity of 730 mAh g(-1) with degradation rate of only 0.061% per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5C.

Here, a type of reduced graphene oxide fiber enwrapped nano-sulfur (rGOF@nano-S) hybrids were synthesized by a simple sulfurcontaining-ion assisted microwave (MW) synthesis method and then utilized as a sulfur host for lithium -sulfur batteries. The synergistic reactions of MW treatments and sulfur-containing-ion force on the precursor GO nanosheets (NSs) have induced a well-crumpled fibrous structure, and simultaneously uniformly wrapped the nano-S particles in them, which would make the resultant cathodes achieve improved electrochemical performances. The rGOF@nano-S hybrid cathodes showed a high reversible capacity (886 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C rate), a high rate capability (remaining 61% at 2 C rate), and an excellent cycling stability (with a minimal decay rate of 0.04% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C), which are highly improved compared to those of the hybrids without MW treatments. In addition, the optimal MW treatment time on rGOF@nano-S hybrid cathodes were also explored to be 2.4 min under 700-W power. This work suggests that MW treatments would be a useful strategy for the preparation of high-performance cathodes for Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, high-sulfur-loading Al2O3 doping of a ZnO-modified carbon nanotube (AZO@S/CNT) composite is synthesized via the hydrothermal method and subsequent high temperature solid-state reaction. Al2O3-doped ZnO (AZO) induces a strong chemical interaction between poly-sulfides to restrain the "shuttle effect." In addition, we use a novel method to enhance the electronic conductivity of the cathode material. The Al2O3 doping of ZnO can increase the electron density in ZnO, and thus enhance its electronic conductivity. The initial discharge capacity of the cathode with 60-wt.% S reaches 1100 mAh g(-1) and the recycle capacity still remains 700 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C with a capacity fade rate of 0.18% per cycle, offering a potential candidate for practical application of high-energy-density Li-S batteries in the future.

The performance of S-MWCNTs composite cathodes with carbon black and VGCFs as sole conductive additives was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), galvanostatic charge-discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the S-MWCNTs composite cathode with VGCFs displays a network-like morphology and exhibits higher activity and better cycle durability compared with the composite cathode with carbon black, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 1254 mA.h/g and a capacity of 716 mA.h/g after 40 cycles at 335 mA/g. The interconnected VGCFs can provide a stable conductive network, suppress the aggregation of cathode materials and residual lithium sulfide and maintain the porosity of cathode, and therefore the electrochemical performance of S-MWCNTs composite cathode is enhanced.

However, practical application of Li-S batteries is hindered by the nonconductive nature of sulfur (S) and continuous capacity fading during cycling. Here, a simple but effective strategy is proposed to fabricate high-performance Li-S batteries by in situ polymerization of polyaniline (PANi)/S/carbon nanofiber (CNF) cathode. Compared to traditional carbon black/S cathodes and other cathode materials with PANi polymer, this effective three-dimensional (3D) cathode design has several advantages: (i) the interconnected and highly conductive CNF/PANi network structure facilitates the electron transfer between the insulating S and conductive CNF mat; (ii) the CNF/PANi network structure, with abundant oxygen and nitrogen heteroatoms, offers strong adsorption for the polysulfides; (iii) the 3D architecture of CNF/S/PANi helps accommodate the volume change of S during cycling and maintain the structural integrity of the cathode; (iv) the easy and simple fabrication process minimizes the time and energy costs; and (v) the freestanding composite cathode without additional polymer binder contributes to higher energy density of Li-S batteries. With all the advantages mentioned above, Li-S cells present a high S utilization with stable cycling performance for over 300 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.08% cycle(-1).

A new interfused hollow nitrogen-doped carbon (HNPC) material, derived from imidazolium-based ionic polymer (ImIP)-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), is reported. A novel method for ZIF-8 disassembly induced by the decomposition of the ImIP shell is proposed. The unique structural superiority gives the resultant electrodes remarkable cycling stability, high rate capability, and large volumetric energy density. A stable reversible discharge capacity over 562 mA h g(-1) at 2 C is achieved after prolonged cycling for 800 cycles and the average capacity decay per cycle is as low as 0.035%. The electrochemical performance achieved greatly surpasses that of ZIF-8-derived carbon matrices and conventional nitrogen-doped carbon materials. This proposed methodology opens a new avenue for the design of hollow-structured carbon nanoarchitectures with target functionalities.

However, the shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides largely hamper the practical success of Li-S batteries. Herein, a unique iron carbide (Fe3C) nanoparticles-embedded porous biomass-derived carbon (Fe3C-PBC) is reported as the excellent immobilizer and promoter for polysulfides regulation. Such a distinctive composite strongly couples the vast active sites of Fe3C nanoparticles and the conductive network of porous biomass-derived carbon. Therefore, Fe3C-PBC is endowed with outstanding adsorptivity and catalytic effect toward inhibiting the shuttle effect and facilitating the redox kinetics of polysulfides, demonstrated by the detailed experimental demonstrations and theoretical calculation.

Nevertheless, intrinsic low conductivity, notorious shuttle effect, and sluggish redox kinetics of sulfur cathode greatly impede their commercialization. Herein, we design and demonstrate a powerful combined strategy to build a novel hybrid architecture for hosting sulfur, which are achieved by growing Ni2P nanodot-enriched 3D graphene-like carbon onto carbon fiber paper (NP-3DGC@CFP) via a facile one-step carbonization approach. In the integrated NP-3DGC@CFP/S electrode: micro-mesoporous 3DGC provides abundant space and complicated pore structures to accommodate sulfur and physically confine polysulfide species; polar Ni2P nanodots chemically immobilize the lithium polysulfides and accelerate electrochemical reaction kinetics; flexible CFP serves as mechanical scaffold to support the electrode and avoids binder-related limitations. As a result, self-supported NP-3DGC@CFP/S cathode demonstrates an excellent combination of capacity, rate, cycling endurance (1409.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, 538.2 mAh g(-1) at 5 C, 786.3 mAh g(-1) with 72.7% retention at 0.5 C for 300 cycles) and anti-self-discharge capability. Significantly, such cathode also shows satisfied cycling stability at a high sulfur loading of 6.5 mg cm(-2) or at a high rate of 2 C, demonstrating its bright perspective for practical application.

The rapid capacity degradation, mainly caused by the notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides (PSs), remains a great challenge preventing practical application. Porous organic polymers (POPs) are one type of promising carbon materials to confine PSs within the cathode region. Here, the research progress on POPs and POPs-derived carbon materials in Li-S batteries is summarized, and the importance of pore surface chemistry in uniform distribution of sulfur and effective trapping of PSs is highlighted. POPs serve as promising sulfur host materials, interlayers, and separators in Li-S batteries. Their significance and innovation, especially new synthetic methods for promoting sulfur content, reversible capacity, Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability, have been demonstrated. The perspectives and critical challenges that need to be addressed for POPs-based Li-S batteries are also discussed. Some attractive electrode materials and concepts based on POPs have been proposed to improve energy density and electrochemical performance, which are anticipated to shed some light on future development of POPs in advanced Li-S batteries.

The wrinkled graphene sheets are interwoven rather than stacked, enabling rich nitrogen-containing active sites. Benefiting from the unique pore structure and nitrogen-doping induced strong polysulfide adsorption ability, lithium-sulfur battery cells using these wrinkled graphene sheets as both sulfur host and interlayer achieved a high capacity of similar to 1000 mAh/g and exceptional cycling stability even at high sulfur content (>= 80 wt %) and sulfur loading (5 mg sulfur/cm(2)). The high specific capacity together with the high sulfur loading push the areal capacity of sulfur cathodes to similar to 5 mAh/cm(2), which is outstanding compared to other recently developed sulfur cathodes and ideal for practical applications.

However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) leads to severe capacity decay and hinders its practical application. In this work, ultrathin polar MnO(2)nanosheets rooting on carbon nanoboxes (C NBs) with high sulfur content have been studied as efficient host for advanced Li-S battery. The carbon nanoboxes confine the active species efficiently and provide large space to relieve the volume expansion during charging/discharging process. The polar MnO(2)nanosheets have strong absorption for LiPSs and catalyze the conversion of soluble polysulfides to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S and back to sulfur. As a result, the polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effect are minimized effectively. Li-S battery assembled with S/MnO2@C NBs cathode shows superior electrochemical performance. The discharge capacity of 856 mAh g(-1)is attained after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. The capacity can also reach 720 mAh g(-1)at 2 C, which is about 2 times higher than the battery assembled with S/C NB electrode.

When these composites are used to prepare a cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries, their fabricated electrode slurries show better dispersion homogeneity than that prepared through the conventional method of simply mixing sulfur and carbon nanopowders. Hence, the resulting cathodes fabricated by using these composites show superior electronic and ionic conductivity compared to that produced through the conventional method. Electrochemical assessment demonstrates that lithium-sulfur batteries fabricated by using the composites show reduced self-discharge and improved capacity and maintained 100% of the columbic efficiency. However, these improvements cannot be achieved if the sulfur crystal of the composite is considerably large, as this negatively affects the dispersion of the electrode constituents.

However, it remains a big challenge to achieve high capacities and sulfur loadings of cathode via a facile and scaled-up method for the practical applications of lithium sulfur batteries. Herein we designed a three dimensional porous cellular carbon framework (PCCF) as sulfur host via a simple template-activation method. The honeycomb architecture of the PCCF with high BET surface area could encapsulate high content sulfur and the 3D interconnected carbon framework could realize high sulfur loading electrode. Benefiting from the 3D porous cellular architecture, the obtained cellular PCCF/S cathode delivers a notable enhancement in the sulfur content, sulfur loading, cycling stability and rate performance.

The research results show that S/Fe-soc@rGO has a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1634.3 mA h g(-1) with a stable specific capacity retention rate of 865.3 mA h g(-1) after 80 cycles and displays enhanced rate performance with high discharge specific capacities of 638.8 and 334.3 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 and 1 C, respectively. Fe-soc has unsaturated metal sites can adsorb sulfur and polysulfide, effectively bind polysulfide, symmetrical stable structure is conducive to speed up the electron and ion transmission efficiency while buffering the volume expansion during charge and discharge. In addition, reduced graphene oxide as a coating layer can better assist Fe-soc to increase the utilization rate of sulfur, and improve the conductivity of the cathode material, thereby improving the cycle performance and rate performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. This article is also expected to stimulate the application of MOF derivatives in energy storage materials.

Within this work we demonstrate that a novel carbon nanofiber/polyvinylidene fluoride (CNF/PVDF) composite membrane can be used as an interlayer for Lithium-Sulfur (Li-S) batteries yielding both high capacity and long cycling life. This PVDF membrane is shown to effectively separate dissolved lithium polysulfide with the high electronic conductivity CNF not only reducing the internal resistance in the sulfur cathode but also helping immobilize the polysulfide through its abundant nanospaces. The resulting Li-S battery assembled with the CNF/PVDF composite membrane effectively solves the polysulfide permeation problem and exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. It is further shown that the CNF/PVDF electrode has an excellent cycling stability and retains a capacity of 768.6 mAh g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency above 99% over 200 cycles at 0.5C, which is more than twice that of a cell without CNF/PVDF (374 mAh g(-1)). In addition, the low-cost raw materials and the simple preparation process of CNF/PVDF composite membrane is also amenable for industrial production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Aiming at these issues, herein, we have designed an ideal three-dimensional (3D)-structured polypyrrole@sulfur@graphene aerogel (PPy@S@GA) as an efficient sulfur host via advanced pyrrole vapor polymerization. GA with an interconnected 3D porous structure provides an excellent conductive network for electrons and a channel for ion transfer, as well as a physical barrier or absorber for the polysulfides. In addition, physical confinement and chemical adsorption are further strengthened by the PPy coating layer with polar nitrogen. The electrode with the PPy@S@GA 3D structure delivered a superior initial discharge specific capacity of 1135 mA h g(-1) and a capacity of 741 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at a rate of 0.5 C, with capacity fading as low as 0.031% per cycle, superior to both a sulfur electrode and a S@GA electrode. These results demonstrate that GA as a sulfur host further coated with PPy is a promising cathode for pursuing high-performance Li-S batteries.

Active sulfur is encapsulated into the hollow carbon microspheres via simple impregnation and heat treatments to design a sulfur-hollow carbon microsphere (S-HC) composite with the novel yolk-shell structure. The hollow carbon shell, acts as a conductor to provide a highly conductivity and short Li+ diffusion distance, as well as absorbs polysulfides to improve the cycle ability of the S-HC composite in lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The internal void space inside the shell can accommodate the volumetric expansion of sulfur during lithiation. The initial discharge capacity of S-HC cathode is as high as 1420 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C. After a 100 cycle stability test, the S-HC cathode exhibits still as high as 710 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C. Test results indicate that the S-HC composite is a promising host material for the sulfur cathode in the Li-S battery applications.

However, the use of low-activity materials and the poor cycle stability of lithium-sulfur batteries severely restrict their application. Here, we prepared a highly porous honeycomb-like carbon (PHC) in two very simple steps, including the mixing of ammonium chloride and sucrose and a straightforward carbonization process. With PHC as the sulfur host, the PHC/S cathode exhibited excellent cycle stability, a high initial discharge capacity of 1200 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and a retentive capacity of 81% after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. These excellent properties can be attributed to the abundant interconnected mesopores, which prevented the shuttling of polysulfides and provided spacious channels for the transportation of electrons and lithium- ions.

A polypyrrole (PPy) coated reduced graphene oxide/S (RGO/S@PPy) material was synthesized in this study. It is shown that sulfur is uniformly distributed on RGO sheets, and a PPy layer is homogeneously coated on the surface of the RGO/S composite. The PPy coating relieves the dissolution of polysulfides and improves the utilization of active sulfur. As a result, a discharge capacity of 631 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.2C and an excellent rate capability are obtained.

The composite cathode is formed by infiltrating sulfur in a N-doped 3D graphene framework prepared by a microwave assisted solvothermal approach, while the electrolyte is obtained by dissolving lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME), and upgraded by addition of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) as a film forming agent. The particular structure of the composite cathode, studied in this work by employing various techniques, well enhances the lithium-sulfur electrochemical process leading to very stable cycling trend and specific capacity ranging from 1000 mAh g(-1) at the highest rate to 1400 mAh g(-1) at the lowest one. The low resistance of the electrode/electrolyte interphase, driven by an enhanced electrode design and a suitable electrolyte, is considered one of the main reasons for the high performance which may be of interest for achieving a promising lithium-sulfur battery. Furthermore, the study reveals a key bonus of the cell represented by the low flammability of the diglyme electrolyte, while comparable conductivity and interface resistance, with respect to the most conventional solution used for the lithium sulfur cell.

This MnO2 modified RGO hybrid was designed as a host for sulfur and served as a cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. The batteries with high loading of sulfur (similar to 70%) show high initial capacity compared with the one without MnO2, and excellent improved cycling performance at high rate of 1C, with a capacity retention of 87% after 300 cycles. The higher performance may benefit from MnO2 as a semiconductor which can facilitate electron transportation and provide migration pathways for Li+ by its tunnels structure, and as an anchor and transfer mediator to chemically trap polysulfides.

Herein, we develop a multifunctional polysulfide barrier reinforced by the graphitic carbon nitride/carbon nanotube (g-C3N4/CNT) composite toward inhibited shuttling behavior and improved battery performance. The obtained g-C3N4 delivers a unique spongelike architecture with massive ion transfer pathways and fully exposed active interfaces, while the abundant C-N heteroatomic structures impose strong chemical immobilization toward lithium polysulfides. Combined with the highly conductive agent, the g-C3N4/CNT reinforced separator is endowed with great capability of confining and reutilizing the active sulfur within the cathode, thus contributing to an efficient and stable sulfur electrochemistry. Benefiting from these synergistic attributes, Li-S cells based on g-C3N4/CNT separator exhibit an excellent cyclability with a minimum decay rate of 0.03% per cycle over 500 cycles and decent rate capability up to 2 C. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 7.69 mAh cm(-2) can be achieved under a raised sulfur loading up to 10.1 mg cm(-2), demonstrating a facile and efficient pathway toward superior Li-S batteries.

However, shuttle effect of the soluble polysulfides severely affects the cycle stability and thus restricts the application of the batteries. Here, a preparation of the titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles uniformly deposited on hierarchical porous carbon (HPC@TiO2) as an efficient sulfur host is reported. The large specific surface area (1016.5 m(2) g(-1)) and high pore volume of the HPC@TiO2 host can buffer the volume expansion of the loaded sulfur. The HPC@TiO2@S cathode is further wrapped with the TiO2 nanoparticles interspersed graphene sheets (G/TiO2), which can improve the electrical conductivity of the electrode and suppress the dissolution of polysulfides. As a result, polysulfides are well confined in the G/TiO2-coated HPC@TiO2@S cathode through a synergistic combination of the G/TiO2 coating and the HPC@TiO2 host. The resultant G/TiO2-coated HPC@TiO2@S cathode with a sulfur loading about 2.4 mg cm(-2) delivers a high reversible capacity of approximate to 919 mAh g(-1) after 80 cycles at 0.2 C, and a satisfactory capacity of approximate to 717 mAh g(-1) is retained after 200 cycles at 0.5 C.

Here, we report an efficient approach to firmly trapping S species by three dimensional (3D) sponge-like graphene cubes (SGCs). The SGCs have a uniform sponge-like structure in size of several microns, which results in a high resistance for the polysulfide diffusion from the central zone of SGCs to the free space in electrolyte. As the cathode in a Li-S battery, the composites of SGCs compounding with 60% elemental sulfur (SGC/0.6S) exhibit a reversible capacity up to 1185 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, superior rate capability (735 mAh g(-1) at 10 C) and an excellent cycling stability (capacity decay of 0.036% per cycle in 500 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the 3D large-size sponge-like structure with high conductivity, abundant pore volumes and stable cubic structures. Our results provide a novel SGC/S composite with great potential to be applied in advanced Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the further developments of Li-S batteries have been obstructed by the low electronic conductivity of active material and the diffusion of polysulfides. In this paper, we found a cheap raw material to. prepare a nitrogen doped porous carbon (NPC) by a simple method. Then, NPC was used to modify the pristine separator to promote the overall performance of Li-S batteries. With the NPC modified separator, a high initial discharge capacity of 1382 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a low fading rate of 0.078% per cycle within 500 cycles at 0.5 C can be delivered by the pure sulfur cathode (1 C = 1675 mAh g(-1)), which attribute to the high-content nitrogen doped level and large specific surface area of NPC. This shows a great potential for the scale-up applications of Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a 3D hierarchical graphitic carbon foam supported graphene@Mo2C (GCF-G@Mo2C) heterostructure is introduced as a freestanding electrode for Li-S batteries with a facile and cost-effective method. The N-doped carbon foam wrapped by graphene sheets with agaric-like porous structure could promote fast electron and ion transport, meanwhile effectively anchor the polysulfides through physical confinement and chemical adsorption by strongly polar-polar interactions. More importantly, the Mo2C nanoparticles can act as the chemical anchoring center to provide strong polysulfide adsorption, as testified by experimental data and first-principle calculations. Moreover, the catalytic effect of Mo2C also accelerates the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion, contributing to enhanced rate performance. As a result, the cell with GCF-G@Mo2C displays an initial capacity as high as 862 mAh g(-1) and a retained capacity of 597 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles with only 0.051% capacity fade per cycle at 1C rate, presenting good cycling stability. In addition, the GCF-G@Mo2C substrate with high sulfur content (70 wt%) and sulfur loading (10.5 mg cm(-2)) achieves an ultra-high areal capacity of 12.6 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C, offering a competitive cathode for high-performance Li-S batteries.

A bidirectional catalyst design, oxide-sulfide heterostructure, is proposed to accelerate both reduction of soluble polysulfides and oxidation of insoluble discharge products (e.g., Li2S), indicating a fundamental way for improving both the cycling stability and sulfur utilization. Typically, a TiO2-Ni(3)S(2)heterostructure is prepared by in situ growing TiO(2)nanoparticles on Ni(3)S(2)surface and the intimately bonded interfaces are the key for bidirectional catalysis. For reduction, TiO(2)traps while Ni(3)S(2)catalytically converts polysulfides. For oxidation, TiO(2)and Ni(3)S(2)both show catalytic activity for Li2S dissolution, refreshing the catalyst surface. The produced sulfur cathode with TiO2-Ni(3)S(2)delivers a low capacity decay of 0.038% per cycle for 900 cycles at 0.5C and specially, with a sulfur loading of 3.9 mg cm(-2), achieves a high capacity retention of 65% over 500 cycles at 0.3C. This work unlocks how a bidirectional catalyst works for boosting Li-S batteries approaching practical uses.

Herein, a rationally designed multichannel carbon nanofiber interlayer embedded with MnO nanoparticles (MnO/mCNF) is presented as a multifunctional interlayer to cope with the shuttling problem in Li-S batteries. MnO/mCNF can provide multifunctionalities including physical blocking, chemical/physical adsorption, and rapid polysulfide conversion synchronously, enabling more active sulfur to participate in energy-storage reactions. The multichannel architecture provides sufficient active surfaces and active sites to anchor polysulfides. Consequently, the Li-S batteries packed with a MnO/mCNF interlayer presented a high reversible capacity (730 mA h g(-1) at 1 C; 92% capacity retention after 400 cycles). Density functional theory calculation results infer that the MnO particles have strong adsorption ability with all kinds of polysulfides, which take responsibility for the suppression of polysulfides. This work paves a scalable method for the practical application of Li-S batteries.

However, an intrinsic property of Li-S systems, that is, the solubility of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), hinders the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Herein, a new material, that is, carbon nitride phosphorus (CNP), is designed and synthesized as a superior LiPS adsorbent to overcome the issues of LiS batteries. Both the experimental results and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that CNP possesses the highest binding energy with LiPS at a P concentration of similar to 22% (CNP22). The DFT calculations explain the simultaneous existence of Li-N bonding and P-S coordination in the sulfur cathode when CNP22 interacts with LiPS. By introducing CNP22 into the Li-S systems, a sufficient charging capacity at a low cutoff voltage, that is, 2.45 V, is effectively implemented, to minimize the side reactions, and therefore, to prolong the cycling life of LiS systems. After 700 cycles, a Li-S cell with CNP22 gives a high discharge capacity of 850 mA h g(1) and a cycling stability with a decay rate of 0.041% cycle(1). The incorporation of CNP22 can achieve high performance in Li- batteries without concerns regarding the LiPS shuttling phenomenon	[Do, Vandung; Kim, Mun Sek; Kim, Min Seop; Cho, Won Il] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Energy Storage Res, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Deepika; Lee, Kwang Ryeol] Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Computat Sci Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea; [Do, Vandung] Korea Univ Sci & Technol UST, Div Energy & Environm Technol, Daejeon 34113, South Korea; [Kim, Mun Sek] Korea Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea		Cho, WI (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Energy Storage Res, Seoul 02792, South Korea.; Lee, KR (corresponding author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Computat Sci Res Ctr, Seoul 02792, South Korea.	krlee@kist.re.kr; wonic@kist.re.kr	Lee, Kwang-Ryeol/E-1242-2011	Lee, Kwang-Ryeol/0000-0002-8211-3257; DO, Vandung/0000-0003-1050-8257; Kim, Mun Sek/0000-0003-0918-3870	Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) Institutional Program [2E29650]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016M1B3A1A01937324, NRF-2016M3A7B4025402]	Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) Institutional Program(Korea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST)); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)	This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) Institutional Program (project no. 2E29650) and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016M1B3A1A01937324 and NRF-2016M3A7B4025402).

However, the inferior ability to confine polysulfides results in quick capacity fading and poor cycling stability of graphene-related electrode materials. Herein, small organic naphthoquinone (NQ) molecules with redox active properties are introduced to the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an advanced sulfur host to significantly prolong cycle life for Li-S batteries. The effective combination between small NQ organic molecules and rGO successfully leads to the conductive composite network, where the keto groups from NQ play the key role in promoting the chemical absorption of polysulfides/sulfur by forming the S-O interaction. Notably, the NQ-rGO composite shows superior lithium polysulfides absorptivity with a sulfur loading of 65.3%.

Here, earth-abundant and eco-friendly pyrite FeS2 supported on N-doped porous carbon sheets is firstly demonstrated to act as a reliable adsorbent and active electrocatalyst towards polysulfide redox reaction with the aid of theoretical calculation and a series of fundamental experiments, which results in fast conversion kinetics of polysulfide. A detailed dissolution-capture-transformation mechanism is proposed on the tri-phase interface among pyrite FeS2, conductive N-doped porous carbon sheets and polysulfide species. On this tri-phase interface, the soluble polysulfide species can be chemically anchored and subsequently transform to Li2S efficiently catalyzed by pyrite FeS2, while the porous N-doped porous carbon sheets serve as highly conductive substrates for the nucleation of Li2S deposition. Consequently, the lithium-sulfur batteries with the composite cathodes exhibits excellent electrochemical rate capability (475 mAh g(-1) at 5 C) and cycling stability (783 mAh g(-1) after 160 cycles). The merits of low cost, eco-friendly feature combined with high activity towards polysulfides conversion reaction endows the pyrite FeS2 a promising electrocatalyst in realizing advanced lithium-sulfur batteries.

Supramolecular adsorbents are expected to fully expose their abundant adsorptive sites in a dynamic framework. In this contribution, we introduced cucurbit[6] uril as a supramolecular capsule for reversible storage/delivery of mobile polysulfides in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries to control undesirable polysulfide shuttle. The Li-S battery equipped with the supramolecular capsules retains a high Coulombic efficiency and shows a large increase in capacity from 300 to 900 mAhg(-1) at a sulfur loading of 4.2 mgcm(-2). The implementation of supramolecular capsules offers insights into intricate multielectron-conversion reactions and manifests as an effective and efficient strategy to enhance Li-S batteries and analogous applications that involve complex transport phenomena and intermediate manipulation.

Herein, we have constructed a high-sulfur-loading monolithic cathode by in-situ reducing graphene oxide (GO) in the aqueous solution with dispersed sulfur-filled N,P dual-doped carbon nanocages (NPCNC). The Li-S battery with the areal sulfur loading of 6 mg cm(-2) exhibits a high areal capacity of 6.7 mAh cm(-2) and a retention of 4.2 mAh cm(-2) after 250 cycles. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergism of the facilitated charge transfer and alleviated polysulfide diffusion by the reduced GO-framed 3D network, and the suppressed shuttle and polarization effects by the confinement and electrocatalysis of NPCNC. In addition, the monolithic sulfur electrode is free from binder, conductive agent and current collector, much beneficial to gravimetric performance. This study demonstrates an efficient strategy to increase the areal performance of Li-S batteries.

Here, a custom separator with an activated carbon nanofiber (ACNF)-filter coated onto a polypropylene membrane is presented. The entire configuration is comprised of the ACNF filter arranged adjacent to the sulfur cathode so that it can filter out the freely migrating polysulfides and suppress the severe polysulfide diffusion. Four differently optimized ACNF-filter-coated separators have been developed with tunable micropores as an investigation into the electrochemical and engineering design parameters of functionalized separators. The optimized parameters that are verified by electrochemical and microstructural analyses require the coated ACNF filter to possess the following: (i) a porous architecture with abundant micropores, (ii) small micropore sizes, and (iii) high electrical conductivity and effective electrolyte immersion. It is found that the ACNF20-filter-coated separator demonstrates an overall superior boost in the electrochemical utilization (discharge capacity: 1270 mA h g(-1)) and polysulfide retention (capacity fade rate: 0.13% cycle(-1) after 200 cycles). These results show that the modified thin-film-coating technique is a viable approach to designing ultratough ACNF-filter-coated separators with outstanding mechanical strength and flexibility as an advanced component in Li-S cells.

However, the low actual energy density and rapid capacity fading are still hindering their practical applications. Herein, MXene-based Co, N-codoped porous carbon nanosheets (MCoNPCNSs) are first developed as sulfur hosts by in situ self-assembly of the bimetallic zeolite imidazole framework on Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets followed by calcining and etching treatments. Co, N codoping on the one hand highly enhances the adsorptivity to polysulfides and on the other hand significantly promotes the kinetics of sulfur cathodes. Therefore, the MCoNPCNSs/S-M-PP electrode achieves a high capacity of 1340.2 mA h g(-1) in the first-cycle discharge process at 0.2 C and an exceptional capacity retention of 914.7 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1 C. Moreover, the integrated structure of the cathode and separator imparts the MCoNPCNSs/S-M-PP electrode a significantly elevated gravimetric energy density of 1211.8 W h kg(-1). Therefore, the integrated MCoNPCNSs/S-M-PP electrode provides a delighted direction for constructing the potentially practical Li-S batteries.

Several strategies have been attempted to solve these problems by designing novel cell structure, including the modification of separator. Herein, we have developed a new carbon black/ LiMn2O4-modified separator for boosting the electrochemical performance of the Li-S batteries. The carbon black (Super P, for short SP) conductive layer plays the roles as an extra current collector for improving the utilization of active materials and a physical obstruction for restraining the diffusion of polysulfide intermediates. The LiMn2O4 (LMO) nanoparticles can chemically adsorb polysulfide intermediates and act as a fast channel for Li ions transportation. The as-prepared Li-S batteries with SP/ LMO separators have delivered the discharge capacity of 1378.3 mAh g(-1) for the initial cycle at 0.05C and 618.7 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5C. The Li-S batteries also possess excellent rate performance and stability, retaining a discharge capacity of 427.1 mAh g(-1) even under a high current density of 2 C. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is still difficult to achieve large-scale commercialization because of the severe lithium polysulfide (UPS) shuttle effect and low sulfur loading. Here, we report a flexible lithium-sulfur battery of a high sulfur loading with the assistance of NiCo2O4 nanofiber array grown carbon cloth. The NiCo2O4 nanofibers are ideal electrocatalysts for accelerating LiPS conversion kinetics through strong chemical interactions. Therefore, the composite cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 1280 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with a sulfur loading of 3.5 mg cm(-2), and it can maintain a high specific capacity of 660 mAh after 200 cycles, showing a good cycle stability. The "layer-by-layer" stacking strategy enables the Li-S battery with a high S loading of similar to 9.0 mg cm(-2) to deliver a high areal capacity of 8.9 mAh cm(-2).

Mechanochemical optimization of ZIF-8/Carbon/S-8 composites for lithium-sulfur batteries positive electrodes	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Metal organic frameworks; ZIF-8; Mechanochemistry	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; ENERGY-STORAGE; ADVANCED NANOMATERIALS; CARBON MATERIALS; CATHODE; CONFINEMENT; ZIF-8; ION; OPPORTUNITIES; CHALLENGES	The application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is still limited by their rapid capacity fading. The pulverization of the sulfur positive electrode after the lithiation and the consequence dissolution of long chain polysulfides in organic solvents lead to the shuttle effect. To address these issues, here we report the mechanochemical preparation of ZIF-8 (Zeolitic Imidazole Framework-8)-based composites as sulfur hosts for positive electrodes in Li-S batteries. We studied different methods for the incorporation of conductive carbon. Also, the replacement of Zn2+ metal centers by other bivalent metals (Cu2+, Co2+ and Ni2+), enabled the preparation of other ZIF8-based materials. The positive electrode ZIF-8/C/S8 showed initial discharges of 772 mA h g-1 while the pristine one, ZIF-8/S8, displayed 502 mA h g-1. The enhanced performance of 54% for ZIF-8/C/S8 indicates that the direct mechanochemical synthesis of ZIF-8 with conductive carbon is beneficial at initials charge/discharge process in comparison to traditional slurry preparation (ZIF-8/S8). Also, the Li2S6 absorption tests shows 87% of discoloration with ZIF-8/C/S8, confirming the better polysulfides absorption.	[Souza, Breno L.; Chauque, Susana; de Oliveira, Paulo F.

Here, collectively exhaustive Ti3C2Tx MXene and graphene oxide (GO) multilayers are reported to suppress the shuttling effect by utilizing both physical inhibition of micro/mesoporous and chemical absorption of surface functional groups. The abundant surface functional groups of GO and MXene attract the positively charged lithium ion (Li+) and eject the negatively charged polysulfides (S-n(2-)) through electrostatic affinity and repulsion. A simple approach using vacuum filtration is utilized to encapsulate elemental sulfur (S-8) between GO and MXene film (GSM), acting as a permselective separator and functionalized current collector, respectively. The functionally antagonistic GSM directly plays a role in a cathode for LSBs and exhibits a specific capacity of 1425 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C in the initial cycle. The abundant functional groups, which can chemisorb the LiPSs, result in a high cyclic retention of approximate to 85.1% after 500 cycles. Furthermore, a flexible LSB is demonstrated with a PEO-LiTFSI electrolyte based on the flexibility of the exceptionally thin GSM due to the 2D nanomaterials, MXene and graphene oxide.

In this study, hydroxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-OH) and cellulose fibers were mixed and then were fabricated as the interlayer by paper-making process. The interlayer of hydroxylated multi-wall carbon nanotube and paper fibers were sandwiched between two PP separators to form the sandwich structure interlayer. The OH hydrophilic functional group formed on the carbon material can effectively trap polysulfides and inhibit the shuttling of polysulfides. At the same time, the MWCNTs-OH paper as the second collector effectively improved the utilization of active materials. The MWCNT-OH sandwich-structure interlayer effectively improved the performance of the lithium-sulfur battery. At 0.1 C rate, the initial discharge specific capacity reached 1532 mAh g(-1). The capacity hold at 516 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C and only exhibited a capacity decay rate of 0.028% per cycle. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the polysulfide shuttling effect is detrimental to the long-term cycling stability. Chemically absorptive host materials provide an effective way to mitigate the dissolution of lithium polysulfide. Carbon nitride (C3N4) is one of the effective host materials with strong interaction with polysulfide species. The low electronic conductivity, however, is unfavorable for high sulfur utilization. In this work, we report the controlled synthesis of porous, well-interconnected C3N4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels as hybrid sulfur host using a simple hydrothermal reaction followed by freeze-drying, which combines the structural merits of both highly conductive rGO networks and chemically active C3N4. By further tuning the structure/morphology and the ratio between C3N4 and rGO, we have demonstrated the C3N4/rGO composites with optimized 1: 2 ratio of C3N4: rGO (termed as CG12) exhibits not only very high sulfur utilization but also excellent rate capability compared to other C3N4/rGO composites, pure rGO, and C3N4. The compositionally and structurally tailored CG12 also shows stable cycling performance over 400 cycles with a low decay rate of 0.09% per cycle. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

When applied in lithium sulfur battery, the coin cells using S/SiO2/ACNF composites as cathode material exhibit a high discharge specific capacity and long cycling life. The specific capacity at 0.5 and 1 C rates after 300 cycles still remains at 584 and 513mA h g(-1), respectively, and the corresponding capacity decay is just 0.09% at 0.5 C and 0.13% at 1 C per cycle. The Zn(CH3COO)(2) activation benefits sulfur loading and volume expansion suppression by creating numerous hierarchical pores in carbon nanofibers.

To overcome these issues, a porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber membrane containing ultrafine and polar ZrO2 (CNF@ZrO2 ) has been investigated as a promising polysulfide host in Li-S batteries. The CNF@ZrO2 interlayer not only serves as a high efficiency lithium polysulfide barrier to suppress the side reactions which is further demonstrated by molecular modeling studies, but also functions as an upper current collector which can enhance the polysulfide redox reactions. Thereby, Li-S batteries with high capacity, prolonged cycle life and stable reversible cyclability can be achieved. A negligible capacity fading rate of 0.039% per cycle over 500 cycles at 0.2 C is obtained. This work offers a facile and effective method of promoting Li-S batteries for practical applications.

However, poor cycling life due to the dissolution of lithium polysulfides hinders its practical application. In this paper, C-60 nanorods are prepared by a facile, scalable and repeatable antisolvent induced precipitation method at an ambient temperature and used as a novel interlayer material for lithium-sulfur batteries. It was proved that C-60 nanorods could efficiently inhibit the diffusion of lithium polysulfides via both physical adsorption and strong chemical bonding. Lithium-sulfur batteries with C-60 interlayer delivered a capacity of 725 mAh g (1) and a capacity retention of 154.5% after 500 cycles at 4800 mAg (1) with a coulombic efficiency around 100%.

The prepared novel porous carbon-encapsulated sulfur composites were fabricated by a simple melting process and used as cathodes for lithium sulfur batteries. Because of the large surface area and hierarchically porous structure of the carbon material, soluble polysulfide intermediates can be trapped within the cathode and the volume expansion can be alleviated effectively. Moreover, the electron transport properties of the carbon materials can provide an electron conductive network and promote the utilization rate of sulfur in cathode. The prepared carbon-sulfur composite exhibited a high specific capacity and excellent cycle stability. The results show a high initial discharge capacity of 1443 mAh g(-1) and retain 804 mAh g(-1) after 80 discharge/charge cycles at a rate of 0.5 C. A Coulombic efficiency retained up to 92% after 80 cycles. The prepared hierarchically porous carbon materials were proven to be an effective host matrix for sulfur encapsulation to improve the sulfur utilization rate and restrain the dissolution of polysulfides into lithium-sulfur battery electrolytes.

Finding a more effective way to suppress the shuttle effect of lithium sulfur battery is still a huge challenge. Herein, a novel polymer encapsulated layer (HPEIGA) was synthesized by a one-step reaction of hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (HPEI) and Glutaraldehyde. The HPEIGA can not only like the traditional encapsulated layer that has the physical barrier effect for inhibiting the dissolution of the polysulfide. More importantly, large amount of nitrogen atoms in HPEIGA can adsorb polysulfide anions by chemical interaction, which can effectively suppress polysulfide shuttling effect. As a result, the shuttling current of the cell based on the encapsulated carbon-nanotube/sulfur (CNT-S) electrode (HPEIGA@CNT-S) is merely 1/8 that of CNT-S electrode without encapsulated layer. Furthermore, the capacity retention of the HPEIGA@CNT-S cell can reach up 73.68% with a small decay of 0.043% per cycle at the current of 2C even after 600 cycles. Thus, nitrogen-contained hyperbranched polymer has a great potential as encapsulated layer of sulfur electrode for high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results clearly evidence the influence of the solvent chain length on the species mobility within the electrolytes that directly affects the behavior in lithium sulfur cell.

The CNF network is used as the current collector and S holder to overcome the insulating nature and volume expansion of S, while the composite membrane comprises a gel polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), and CNF additive is used as an interlayer to trap polysulfides and recycle the remaining S species, leading to a high specific capacity and long cycle life. This 3D structure enables excellent cyclability for 500 cycles at 0.5 A degrees C with a small capacity decay of 0.092% per cycle. Furthermore, an outstanding cycle stability was also achieved at even higher current densities (1.0 to 2.0 A degrees C), indicating its good potential for practical applications of Li-S batteries.

Herein, nitrogen doped hierarchical 3D porous carbons (NHPC) were prepared via a novel metal-organic aerogel (MOA), using hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid and copper (II) as starting materials. The morphology, porous structure of the building blocks in the NHPC can be tuned readily using different amount of HMT, which makes elongation of the pristine octahedron of HKUST-1 to give rise to different aspect ratio rod-like structures. The as-prepared NHPC with rod-like carbons exhibit high performance in lithium sulfur battery due to the rational ion transfer pathways, high N-doped doping and hierarchical porous structures. As a result, the initial specific capacity of 1341 mA h/g at rate of 0.5 C (1C = 1675 mA h/g) and high-rate capability of 354 mA h/g at 5C was achieved. The decay over 500 cycles is 0.08% per cycle at 1C, highlighting the long-cycle Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Owing to the excellent Li+ ion and electronic transport properties of the MWCNTs-W and the RGO, this unique structure can provide a three-dimensional conductive network and promote rapid charge-transfer reaction at the cathode. Furthermore, because of the rough surface and porous structure of the MWCNTs after activation with KOH, and the special adsorption ability of the RGO, the soluble polysulfide intermediates can be effectively trapped in the cathode. Therefore, when evaluating the electrochemical properties of the RGO@MWCNTs-W/S composite as the cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, it exhibits an excellent cyclical stability and high rate performance. In particular, even at an ultrahigh rate (5 C), a discharge capacity as high as 620 mAh g, is still retained for the RGO@MWCNTs-W/S composite with 68.93 wt% sulfur after 200 cycles, and the average coulombic efficiency is 96%.

Composite sulfur cathode fabricated with the application of this carbon has been shown to exhibit a very large initial specific discharge capacity of 886 mAh g(-1), at 0.1 C current rate, which remained remarkably stable over subsequent 50 charge/discharge cycles (capacity loss <1%). Excellent reversibility and cyclic stability of this composite cathode has been attributed to a unique combination of micro and macroporosity, as well as surface chemistry, allowing for the retention of the intermediate polysulfides within the carbon framework, without excessive dissolution in the bulk of electrolyte.

In order to inhibit the shuttle of polysulfide and accelerate its conversion rate. Here, a metal-doped carbon nanocage material for battery coating layer is proposed, which includes externally grown long graphitized carbon nanotubes and Co-N doped shell. Coating this multifunctional carbon material on a commercial separator can dramatically improve the performance of Li-S batteries using a high sulfur areal loading cathode. The metal Co doping and N active sites can increase the chemical adsorption capacity of polysulfides while accelerating redox kinetics. The hollow structure and epitaxially grown carbon nanotubes are beneficial to electrolyte penetration and lithium ion migration. Therefore, Li-S battery using the modified Co-N-C coating layer displayed both promising cycle performance and rate capability. In order to promote the commercial application of coated separators, all electrochemical performance tests are performed on the cathodes which possess sulfur areal density larger than 3 mg cm-2. In particular, the specific discharge capacity of the Li-S coin cell using the modified Co-N-C nanocage coating layer maintains 725 mAh g-1 after 200 charging/discharging cycles, and the capacity retention rate can reach 88%. Especially, while the sulfur mass areal loading increased to 4.7 mg cm-2, the battery can still cycle stably for more than 400 cycles at 1C.

However, the areal sulfur loading is commonly less than 4.0 mg cm(-2), which limits the energy density and practical application of Li-S cells. In this contribution, three-dimensional (3D) aluminum foam/carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffolds were applied as the current collectors to build long- and short-range electron pathways and provided enough space for high sulfur loading. The sulfur loading amount on the 3D current collectors ranged from 7.0 to 12.5 mg cm(-2). A high initial discharge capacity of 6.02 mAh cm(-2) (860 mAh g(-1)) was achieved on an electrode with an improved sulfur loading of 7.0 mg cm-2. Therefore, the combination of 3D long-range current collectors and short-range CNT conductive scaffold provides an efficient and effective route to make full use of sulfur with a very high sulfur loading amount in a Li-S cell.

However, sulfur cathodes suffer from inherent problems of its poor electronic conductivity and the shuttling of highly dissoluble lithium polysulfides generated during the cycles. Loading sulfur into porous carbons has been proved to be an effective approach to alleviate these issues. Mesoporous and microporous carbons have been widely used for sulfur accommodation, but mesoporous carbons have poor sulfur confinement, whereas microporous carbons are impeded by low sulfur loading rates. Here, a core-shell carbon, combining both the merits of mesoporous carbon with large pore volume and microporous carbon with effective sulfur confinement, was prepared by coating the mesoporous CMK-3 with a microporous carbon (MPC) shell and served as the carbon host (CMK-3@MPC) to accommodate sulfur. After sulfur infusion, the as-obtained S/(CMK-3@MPC) cathode delivered a high initial capacity of up to 1422 mAh.g(-1) and sustained 654 mAh.g-1 reversible specific capacity after 36 cycles at 0.1 C. The good performance is ascribed to the unique core-shell structure of the CMK-3@MPC matrix, in which sulfur can be effectively confined within the meso/microporous carbon host, thus achieving simultaneously high electrochemical utilization.

Herein, the two-dimensional N-doped carbon nanosheets with appropriate distribution of micro/mesopores are proposed as a novel barrier to modify the commercial polypropylene separator, which significantly reduce the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides via physical confinement and chemical bonding and immobilize them as active materials within the cathode side. In addition, the efficient electrocatalysis of the functionalized carbon nanosheets on improving sulfur redox electrochemistry is revealed by systematic characterization, leading to rapid polysulfide conversion kinetics and uniform deposition of lithium sulfides. Due to the smooth trappingadsorption-conversion process of polysulfides by applying the modified separator, the Li-S batteries with the simple carbon black/S cathodes exhibit outstanding lithium storage capacity (1338 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and satisfactory cycling stability (0.029% capacity decreasing per cycle over 700 cycles at 3 C). More importantly, a high reversible areal capacity of 4.3 mAh cm(-2) could be maintained at high sulfur loading (5.8 mg cm(-2)), showing the striking commercial potential. These findings not only provide a feasible method to enhance electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, but also open up a new sight on developing carbon nanomaterials as metal-free electrocatalysts for multistep reactions in battery electrochemistry.

The cell with functional carbon layer-coated separator can reach a high initial capacity of 1070 mAh g(-1), at the rate of 0.5 C, and maintain a high capacity retention ratio with the capacity of 778 mAh g(-1) after 100th charge/discharge cycle. Besides, the coulombic efficiency of the cell with functional carbon layer-coated separator rises from 80% to nearly 90% without the addition of LiNO3 additive, which indicates the reduction of shuttle effect The improved cell performance is attributed to the functional carbon-coating layer, which serves as an upper current collector to facilitate electron transport for high active-material utilization and a conductive network for trapping and depositing dissolved sulfur-containing active materials, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) possesses high lithium ion conductivity, and it is also can be used as an active adsorbent for polysulfide. Herein, fine LTO particle coated carbon nanofibers (CNF) were prepared and a conductive network both for electron and lithium ion was built, which can greatly promote the electrochemical conversion of polysulfide and improve the rate performance of Li-S batteries. Meanwhile, a quantity of adsorption sites is constructed by defects of the surface of LTO-CNF membrane to effectively immobilize polysulfide. The multifunctional LTO-CNF interlayer could impede the shuttle effect and enhance comprehensive electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, especially high rate performance. With such LTO-CNF interlayer, the Li-S battery presents a specific capacity of 641.9 mAh/g at 5C rate. After 400 cycles at 1 C, a capacity of 618.0 mAh/g is retained. This work provides a feasible strategy to achieve high performance of Li-S battery for practical utilization.

Herein, for the first time, conductive CoOOH sheets are introduced as carbon-free sulfur immobilizer to fabricate sulfur-based composite as cathode for lithium-sulfur battery. CoOOH sheet is not only a good sulfur-loading matrix with high electron conductivity, but also exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the conversion of soluble lithium polysulfide. With an ultrahigh sulfur content of 91.8 wt% and a tap density of 1.26 g cm(-3), the sulfur/CoOOH composite delivers high gravimetric capacity and volumetric capacity of 1199.4 mAh g(-composite)(-1) and 1511.3 mAh cm(-3) at 0.1C rate, respectively. Meanwhile, the sulfur-based composite presents satisfactory cycle stability with a slow capacity decay rate of 0.09% per cycle within 500 cycles at 1C rate, thanks to the strong interaction between CoOOH and soluble polysulfides. This work provides a new strategy to realize the combination of gravimetric energy density, volumetric energy density, and good electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur battery.

For this purpose, we synthesized Ni-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) particles and coated them with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto the polyethylene (PE) separator. The Ni-MOF particles on separator effectively blocked the migration of lithium polysulfides toward the anode side owing to the strong interaction between Ni-MOFs and lithium polysulfides. The highly conductive MWCNTs in the coating layer allowed reutilization of the trapped reaction intermediates during the subsequent cycles. Due to these beneficial effects of coating materials, the lithium-sulfur cell assembled with Ni-MOF/ MWCNT-coated PE separator initially delivered a high discharge capacity of 1358 mAh g(-1) with good cycling stability and high-rate performance.

J	Yan, RY; Oschatz, M; Wu, FX				Yan, Runyu; Oschatz, Martin; Wu, Feixiang			Towards stable lithium-sulfur battery cathodes by combining physical and chemical confinement of polysulfides in core-shell structured nitrogen-doped carbons	CARBON			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Sulfur; Porous carbon; Cathode; Polysulfides	PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; MOLECULES; POROSITY; PROGRESS	Despite intensive research on porous carbon materials as hosts for sulfur in lithium-sulfur battery cathodes, it remains a problem to restrain the soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates for a long-term cycling stability without the use of metallic or metal-containing species. Here, we report the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon materials with hierarchical pore architecture and a core-shell-type particle design including an ordered mesoporous carbon core and a polar microporous carbon shell. The initial discharge capacity with a sulfur loading up to 72 wt% reaches over 900 mA h g(sulf)(ur)(-1) at a rate of C/2. Cycling performance measured at C/2 indicates similar to 90% capacity retention over 250 cycles. In comparison to other carbon hosts, this architecture not only provides sufficient space for a high sulfur loading induced by the high-pore-volume particle core, but also enables a dual effect of physical and chemical confinement of the polysulfides to stabilize the cycle life by adsorbing the soluble intermediates in the polar microporous shell. This work elucidates a design principle for carbonaceous hosts that is capable to provide simultaneous physical-chemical confinement. This is necessary to overcome the shuttle effect towards stable lithium-sulfur battery cathodes, in the absence of additional membranes or inactive metal-based anchoring materials.

Electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratio and carbon-to-sulfur (C/S) ratio in the cell are key examples of these critical design factors that define the Li-S battery performance. Here, a 1-D electrochemical model is reported to calculate the dependence of the discharge behavior of a Li-S battery on the E/S and C/S ratios. Proposed model describes the complex kinetics through two electrochemical and two dissolution/precipitation reactions. Concentration variations in the cathode are also taken into account in the model. Characteristic aspects of the discharge profile of a Li-S battery -the two distinct voltage plateaus and the voltage dip in between- are captured in the predicted voltage curve. Similar trends on the discharge performance of the Li-S cell with varying E/S and C/S ratios are projected; both voltage and discharge capacity of the Li-S battery are improved substantially with increasing C/S or E/S ratio up to a certain point, whereas, the dependence of the discharge performance on these factors is less substantial at higher ratios. This model offers a mechanistic interpretation of the influence of cell design on the Li-S battery performance.

Nevertheless, the electrochemical properties of sulfur host materials have been limited by the large volume changes during cycles, the dissolution of polysulfides in an electrolyte, and the insulating properties of lithium polysulfides. Based on the above conclusions, a novel cathode material of graphene nanosheet@spherical ordered mesoporous carbon/sulfur nanocomposite (GNs@s-OMC/S) where s-OMC/S was wrapped by GNs has been synthesized in this article and delivers superior cycle stability. According to the tests, GNs@s-OMC/S provides a capacity of 1159 mAh g(-1) at a 0.4 C discharge rate. In addition, even at a high rate of 4 C, the discharge capacity of GNs@s-OMC/S can also remain 767 mAh g(-1), representing a fantastic rate performance and high specific capacity. It can be ensured that the narrow channels provided by s-OMC and the graphene entrapment with high conductivity enhance the electrochemical performance of the cathode.

In this work, a polypyrrole-coated loose network mesoporous carbon/sulfur composite (C/S@PPy) was designed. In this structure, the conductive networks of mesoporous carbon are perfect hosts to contain sulfur and enhance the conductivity of the cathode; the conductive polymer-coating layer further inhibits the lithium polysulfides from dissolution and migration in the electrolyte.

However, the performance degradation of sulfur cathodes with high mass loadings remains a significant challenge to be addressed. Here, a 3D multifunctional integrated and sponge-like architecture is designed as the cathode framework, which provides a favorable balance between high sulfur loadings and uncompromised electrochemical performances. In this architecture, a highly porous nitrogen-doped carbon fiber foam is used as a 3D current collector and host for sulfur accommodation and a thin graphene layer is used for polysulfide interception, which not only facilitates fast electron and lithium-ion transport but also enables effective active material immobilization by both physical restriction and chemical adsorption. With a sulfur loading of 7.7 mg cm(-2), high areal capacities up to 8.7 mAh cm(-2) are attained together with excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles. This approach demonstrates a new concept for the construction of cathode architectures for practical Li-S batteries and can be extended to other battery systems.

By magnetic string, 3.7 wt% PEO is coated onto the surface of ball-milling obtained S/C composite, leading to synthesis of S/C/PEO composite containing 78 wt% S. It is confirmed from a series of measurements that PEO covers the S/C composite uniformly, and PEO coating is quite effective in stabilizing the electrochemical performance. When employed as cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries, S/C/PEO delivers an initial discharge capacity of 989.6 mAh g(-1) and remains 648.3 mAh g(-1) after 110 cycles at a discharge/charge rate of 1 C (based on sulfur weight). Meanwhile, the coulomb efficiency of S/C/PEO composite reaches to similar to 98 % during the latter 105 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the formation of PEO coating layer which can keep a tight contact between carbon and sulfur and lead to improved conductivity. Moreover, the PEO coating can act as a flexible cushion to accommodate volume changes of sulfur cathode as well as a barrier to trap soluble polysulfide intermediates during the charge-discharge processes.

Nevertheless, the application process of lithium-sulfur batteries is severely obstructed by disadvantageous shuttle effect, which arises from the dissolution and migration of intermediate polysulfides and its sluggish conversion kinetics. Herein, we design the conductivity-adsorption-catalysis reaction interface, which is constructed by growing NiCo2S4 nanoparticle on reduced graphene oxide (NiCo2S4@rGO), to afford chemical immobilization and conversion promotion of polysulfides. In this structure, rGO with excellent conductivity can ensure rapid electron transfer and well-distributed NiCo2S4 nanoparticles serve as high-efficiency active sites to anchor polysulfides and accelerate its conversion reaction. Thus, lithium-sulfur batteries with this multifunctional reaction interface deliver improved cycling stability with capacity retention rate of 76% after 500 cycles at 1 C. And a good initial capacity of 776 mAh g(-1) is gained under high sulfur loading of 3.6 mg cm(-2). This work supplies promising interface design strategies to enhance polysulfides redox kinetics and alleviate shuttle effect for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To solve this problem, a modified layer is prepared by coating I and N co-doped hierarchical micro/mesoporous kelp bio-carbon on surface of the polypropylene separator. Furthermore, the composite porous carbon is obtained by one-step thermal pyrolysis of edible dried kelp. The modified layer on separator can effectively prevent shuttle of polysulfides due to the synergistic effect from the micro/mesoporous carbon structures (physisorption effect) and I and N co-doped electrochemical active sites in carbon matrix (chemisorption effect), allowing high capacity and high coulombic efficiency. In this study, we developed Li-S batteries with 80% sulfur loading content and the area loading is higher than 2.0 mg cm(-2), which are better than previous published ones. In addition, the cathode electrode could stabilize at 760 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and delivers a high retention specific capacity of 498 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with a slight capacity attenuation of 0.07% per cycle.

However, the extensive commercial applications of Lithium sulfur batteries still have many obstacles, such as the most serious "shuttle effect". Here, we synthesize a novel nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon only by simple calcination and acid treatment processes to effectively adsorb the diffused polysulfides. Then, the nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon is sandwiched between two carbon nanotube layers to form a sandwich-structure composite carbon layer on the separator, which effectively synergizes the advantages of sp(3)-hybridized nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon and sp(2)-hybridized carbon nanotube. The results indicate that the sandwich-structure composite carbon layer not only can well block the shuttle of polysulfides, but also has good conductive and mechanical properties. Therefore, the cells with the sandwich-structure composite carbon layers exhibit excellent long cycling performance at a high rate (422.9 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at 4C with a capacity decay of 0.081% per cycle) and outstanding rate capability (1279.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and 644.3 mA h g(-1) at 4C). This work has certain practical value for Lithium sulfur batteries with its excellent electrochemical performances and simple synthesis processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To address the insulation nature of sulfur, nanocarbon composition is essential to afford acceptable cycling capacity but inevitably sacrifices the actual energy density under working conditions. Therefore, rational structural design of the carbon/sulfur composite cathode is of great significance to realize satisfactory electrochemical performances with limited carbon content. Herein, the cathode carbon distribution is rationally regulated to construct high-sulfur-content and high-performance Li?S batteries. Concretely, a double-layer carbon (DLC) cathode is prepared by fabricating a surface carbon layer on the carbon/sulfur composite. The surface carbon layer not only provides more electrochemically active surfaces, but also blocks the polysulfide shuttle. Consequently, the DLC configuration with an increased sulfur content by nearly 10 wt% renders an initial areal capacity of 3.40 mAh cm-2 and capacity retention of 83.8% during 50 cycles, which is about two times than that of the low-sulfur-content cathode. The strategy of carbon distribution regulation affords an effective pathway to construct advanced high-sulfur-content cathodes for practical high-energy-density Li?S batteries. @& nbsp;2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, poor conductivity of sulfur, critical cyclability problems due to shuttle of polysulfides as intermediate products of the cathodic reaction, and large volume variation of the sulfur composite cathode upon operation are the major bottlenecks impeding the implementation of the next-generation Li-S batteries. In this work, a unique three-dimensional (3D) interconnected macrocellular porous carbon (PC) architecture decorated with metal Ni nanoparticles was synthesized by a simple and facile strategy. The as-fabricated Ni/PC composite combines the merits of conducting carbon skeleton and highly adsorptive abilities of Ni, which resulted in efficient trapping of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and their fast conversion in the electrochemical process. Owing to these synergistic advantageous features, the composite exhibited good cycling stability (512.3 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1 C with an extremely low capacity fading rate 0.03 % per cycle), and superior rate capability (747.5 mA h g(-1) at 2 C). Accordingly, such Ni nanoparticles embedded in a renewable puffed corn-derived carbon prepared via a simple and effective route represent a promising active type of sulfur host matrix to fabricate high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the particularly rapid capacity decay owing to the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfide intermediate into the electrolyte still hamper their practical applications. And the reported preparation procedures to sulfur based cathode materials are often complex, and hence are rather difficult to produce at large scale. Here, we report a simple mechano-chemical sulfurization methodology in vacuum environment applying ball-milling method combined both the chemical and physical interaction for the one-pot synthesis of edge-sulfurized grapheme nanoplatelets with 3D porous foam structure as cathode materials. The optimal sample of 70% S-GnPs-48 h (ball-milled 48 h) obtains 13.2 wt% sulfur that chemically bonded onto the edge of GnPs. And the assembled batteries exhibit high initial discharge capacities of 1089 mAh/g at 0.1 C and 950 mAh/g at 0.5 C, and retain a stable discharge capacity of 776 mAh/g after 250 cycles at 0.5 C with a high Coulombic efficiency of over 98%. The excellent performance is mainly attributed to the mechano-chemical interaction between sulfur and grapheme nanoplatelets. This definitely triggers the currently extensive research in lithium-sulfur battery area. (C) 2016 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In this article, the triple-phase interfaces of graphene-like carbon clusters on antimony trisulfide (C-Sb2S3) nanowires are tailored to design a multifunctional polysulfide host which can inhibit migration of polysulfides and accelerate conversion kinetics of redox electrochemical reactions. Benefiting from the triple-interface design of polysulfides/Sb2S3/carbon clusters, the C-Sb2S3 electrode not only anchors polysulfide migration by the synergistic effect of Sb, S, and C atoms as interfacial active sites, but also the graphene-like carbon clusters shorten the diffusion paths to further favor redox electron/ion transport through the liquid (elec-trolyte/polysulfide) and solid (Li2S/S-8, carbon clusters, and Sb2S3)-based triple-phases. Therefore, these Li2S6-based C-Sb2S3 cells possess high sulfur loading, excellent cycling stability, impressive specific capacity, and great rate capability. This work of interfacial engineering reveals insight for powering reac-tion kinetics in the complicated multistep catalysis reaction with multiphase evolution-based charge-transfer/non-transfer processes.

Herein, we develop novel hierarchical ultrathin porous carbon shell anchored with RuO2 nanoparticles as efficient cathode hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries. The carbon shell can allow efficient impregnation of sulfur and provide effective spatial confinement to reduce polysulfide diffusion. In addition, the volume expansion of sulfur upon lithiation can be also remitted due to the sufficient space inside the carbon shell. The anchored RuO2 nanoparticles in the host material can synergistically enhance the immobilization of polysulfide and accelerate their redox reaction. Accordingly, this hierarchical structure based-cathode containing 70.6 wt% sulfur content delivers enhanced electrochemical performances including high specific capacity, excellent rate performance and superior cycling stability.

Although catalysts have been extensively studied on the sulfur reduction reaction, little is known of their role in sulfur oxidation reaction. In this study, highly dispersed vanadium carbide anchored on N-doped carbon nanotubes (VC@NCNTs) was prepared as a bidirectional catalyst for LSBs. Density functional theory, visual adsorption experiments, symmetrical cell cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and dimensionless analysis, and activation energy calculations were used to study the adsorption catalytic effect of polysulfide. Detailed experimental results indicate that VC@NCNTs can capture polysulfide and convert it efficiently, reducing the activation energy (Ea) to considerably improve both directions of redox kinetics. Density functional calculations (DFT) confirm the adsorption strength of VC@NCNTs and electroactivity. The bifunctional VC@NCNTs catalyst exhibited promising practical performance in a lithium-sulfur cell, including high reversible capacity (1053 mAh g-1), excellent and steady coulombic efficiency (~100%), and admirable battery fast charging performance (3 C). This research establishes bidirectional electrocatalysis as a promising pathway to tackle kinetic hysteresis in the redox process for LSBs.

However, a serious shuttle effect resulted from polysulfide ions has not been effectively suppressed yet due to the weak absorption nature of CA, resulting in rapid decay of capacity as the cycle number increases. Herein, ultrafine (similar to 3 nm) gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) nanoparticles (with upper redox potential of similar to 1.58 V versus Li+/Li) are uniformly in-situ integrated with CA through directly sol-gel polymerization and high-temperature carbonization. The Gd2O3 modified CA composites (named as Gdx-CA, where x means molar ratio of Gd2O3 nanoparticles to carbon) are incorporated with S. Then, the products (S/Gdx-CA) are acted as sulfur host materials for Li-S batteries. The results demonstrate that adding ultrafine Gd2O3 nanoparticles can dramatically improve the electrochemical properties of the composite cathodes. The S/Gd2-CA electrode (loading with 58.9 wt% of S) possesses the best electrochemical properties, including a high initial capacity of 1210 mAh g(-1) and a relatively high capacity of 555 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1 C. It is noteworthy that the performance of long-term cycle (350 cycles) for the S/Gd2-CA (317 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles and 233 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles at 1 C) is improved significantly than that of S/CA (150 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles at 1 C). Overall, the enhancement of electrochemical performances can be due to the strong polar nature of the ultrafine Gd2O3 nanoparticles, which provide strong adsorption sites to immobilize S and polysulfide. Furthermore, the Gd2O3 nanoparticles present a catalytic effect. Our research suggests that adding Gd2O3 nanoparticles into S/CA composite cathode is an effective and novelty method for improving the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries.

Mesoporous carbon/sulfur (CMK-3/S) composites, controllably coated with graphene sheets via the functionalization of the CMK-3 surface with the assistance of a bridging agent (L-lysine and PEG), are presented here. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the graphene could be coated uniformly and tightly on the surface of mesoporous carbon/sulfur (RGO@CMK-3/S) particles in the presence of L-lysine. In this unique "double-carbon" structure, the abundant pore structure and graphene coating layers serve to accommodate the large volume expansion of the sulfur nanoparticles during discharge, preventing the dissolution of polysulfide intermediates from the cathode, and improving the sulfur nanoparticles' electrical conductivity. Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests indicated that the RGO@CMK-3/S composite prepared using L-lysine exhibited high and stable specific capacities of up to similar to 720 mA h g(-1) over more than 100 cycles at 0.5C, and an excellent rate capability of 660 mA h g(-1) at a rate of 2C, representing a promising cathode material for rechargeable lithium batteries.

However, the shuttle effect and insulating properties of sulfur restrict its practical application. Herein, we report a facile approach to fabricate Al-TDC@S-PPy composite material as lithium-sulfur battery electrode. In this strategy, a topological porous Al-TDC (TDC=2,5-thiophenedicarboxylate) with 8-connected clusters is reported, which can provide strong adsorption for dissolved intermediate polysulfides and alleviate volume expansion. Meanwhile, Polypyrrole, (PPy) as a conductive and flexible additive to expedite electron transport, improves electrical conductivity. Consequently, the Al-TDC@S-PPy composite cathode exhibits a higher initial specific capacity (1310.4mAhg(-1) at 0.2C). The final reversible capacity is 411.0mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C. We can extend this strategy to other metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and manufacture MOF/conductive polymer composite electrodes for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

In the interlayer, Si3N4 nanoparticles suppress the migration of the dissolved polysulfides and graphene sheets construct a 3-dimensional charge-transfer network. The carbon-nanotubes/sulfur@Si3N4/graphene cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1334.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and retains a capacity as high as 745.8 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, with a capacity fade ratio of 0.22% per cycle. The cathode shows good cycling life, delivering a discharge capacity of 413.3 mAh g(-1) for 1 C after 1000 cycles. According to the results of density functional theory calculation, the anchoring of the Si3N4/graphene interlayer to lithium polysulfide can be attributed to a coefficient chemical binding of Li-N and Si-S bonds generating from electronic conjugation effect between the Si3N4 supercell surface and the polysulfides. Generally, the improvement in electrochemical performance originates from the enhancements in Li+ diffusion coefficient and charge transfer, and from the restraining of the shuttle effect of the dissolved lithium polysulfide as a result of the Si3N4/graphene interlayer.

In this work, amicro-mesoporous carbon/magnesium oxide/sulfur composite is developed for lithium-sulfur batteries. The novel micro-mesoporous carbon powders grown on diatomite substrates by chemical vapor deposition provide efficient pathways for electron migration in the cathode and alleviate the structural failure caused by volume expansion. Our combined experimental and simulated results confirm that the synergistic magnesium oxides play an important role in anchoring lithium polysulfides. We find in this study that micro-mesoporous carbon/magnesium oxide/sulfur composite with 10 wt % magnesium oxide shows the best cycle and rate performance: a) the battery exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1143 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C and a reversible capacity of 592 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles with an average of 99% columbic efficiency. b) A reversible discharge capacity of 664 mAh g(-1) is achieved after 400 cycles at 2 C which corresponds to a very small capacity decay per cycle similar to 0.065%. c) 90% reversible capacity remains after 200 cycles even under a current density as high as 5 C.

Herein, an interconnected hollow carbon nanocages with tailored nitrogen-doping (CNCs) is reported via confined pyrolysis of Zn, Co zeolitic imidazolate framework within the resorcinol-melamine-formaldehyde shell. The interconnected cavity and the porous carbon skeletons guarantee the well-dispersion and immobilization of sulfur cathode even with high sulfur content of 80 wt %. In addition, developed microporosity and numerous nitrogen functional groups on the carbon surface favor for the chemisorption, conversion of polysulfide and uniform growth of Li2S. Hence, the resulting S/CNC-1 cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1310 mAh g(-1)@0.2 C, excellent rate performance with 762 mAh g(-1) at 8 C and ultra-long lifespan with a reversible capacity of 841 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles. More importantly, a high capacity of 4.8 mAh cm(-2) is attained at high sulfur content of 80 wt% and areal sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2). These findings provide an effective method for future development of practical lithium sulfur battery with superior rate performance and long lifespan.

Herein, we have designed a novel sulfur-loading composite of C/Ni/NiO, consisting of flower-like Ni/NiO porous microspheres superficially decorated by sericin-derived carbon, utilized as cathodes of Li-S batteries. The Ni/NiO porous microspheres provide more active sites for electrochemical ionic exchange by using its large surface areas and also provide a strong polar chemical adsorption with polysulfides via forming Ni-S bonds. Additionally, the conductive metallic nickel and sericin-derived biomass carbon can effectively improve reaction kinetics by accelerating electron transport. Based on the synergistic effects, Li-S batteries with the as-prepared S@C/Ni/NiO cathodes deliver a high initial capacity of 1192.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a low capacity decay of 0.068% within 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. Meanwhile, a high rate up to 5.0 C with a capacity retention of 171.3 mAh g(-1) is also achieved.

However, the sulfur cathode presents two major drawbacks, specifically low specific capacity caused by the poor electrical conductivities of the active materials and fast capacity decay caused by polysulfide dissolution/shuttling. Herein, a high-rate and high-stability dendritic material consisting of N-doped ordered mesoporous carbons (NOMCs) was successfully synthesized via a facile and low-cost calcination method. The highly ordered mesoporous carbon skeleton limited the growth of the sulfur nanofiller within its channels and provided the necessary electrical contact with the insulating sulfur. Furthermore, N-doped heteroatoms presented strong binding sites for trapping poly sulfide intermediates, achieving high electrochemical activity, which promoted polysulfide conversion reactions. As a result, the prepared NOMC-2/S cathode material with 1.2-1.5 mg cm(-2) of sulfur displayed excellent electrochemical performance with a high-rate capability of 460.5 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, a high specific capacity of 530.9 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C, and a decay rate of similar to 0.19% per cycle.

In this work, a novel, cloud cap-like and phosphorus/nitrogen co-containing biomass carbon material derived from mushroom as cathode host materials for lithium sulfur batteries were fabricated by a facile H3PO4 activation method. The porous carbon carbonized at 650 degrees C contains abundant micro/mesopores and possesses the high BET surface area of 788 m(2) g(-1) and the main pore size of 1.1-2.5 nm, which can boost the adsorption of sulfur and polysulphides by melt-diffusion technology. The sulfur/biomass carbon composite delivers the high initial specific capacity of 1357.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and high capacity retention of 729 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles due to its specific porous structure. The relatively high discharge capacity of 213 mA h g(-1) is exhibited in the composite even after 72 cycles at higher discharge rates (0.2 C, 0.3 C, 0.5 C, 1 C and 2 C). All these superior performances well validate the excellent stability and reversibility of the biomass porous carbon as a promising cathode matrix for lithium-sulfur batteries. In addition, the biomass carbon derived from mushroom contains simultaneously phosphorus and nitrogen, which can improve the specific capacity. For the present carbon materials, the special porous structure may encapsulate sulfur particles, inhibit the dissolution of polysulphides in the electrolyte and thus lead to the excellent performances of the materials. Our study shows that the porous biochar arising from mushroom can be easily fabricated and considered as the promising conductive materials for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Based on the synergistic role of porous carbon and polar MoS3 with sulfur-like characteristic, polysulfides are effectively anchored and shuttle effect is greatly reduced. In particular, 10 wt% MoS(3)A bridged S/C composite exhibits the best electrochemical performance. After 100 cycles at 0.2C, the discharge specific capacity remains 727.6 mA h g(-1), and the capacity retention rate is 59.0%. When cycling 300 times at 1C, the capacity is still maintained at 546.9 mA h g(-1), and the coulomb efficiency is around 97.0%. The results show that MoS3 effectively improves the cyclic property of S/C composite for lithium-sulfur battery.

In the composite, the nitrogen-doped graphitized porous carbon possesses good electronic conductivity and physical adsorption capability for soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Furthermore, the polar NiFe alloy provides the active sites to anchor the LiPSs and effectively promote the redox conversion kinetics of these intermediates. To confirm this, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to demonstrate that there is sufficient binding energy between the NiFe alloy and LiPSs. Owing to the above-mentioned benefits, the batteries with the S/NiFe@NC cathode deliver a high initial reversible capacity (1224 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C) along with a stable cycling ability (565 mA h g(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles). Our findings provide insights towards building the novel sulfur-host materials for advanced Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the practical applications are often handicapped by sluggish electrochemical kinetics and the "shuttle effect" of electrochemical intermediate polysulfides. Herein, we propose an in-situ copolymerization strategy for covalently confining a sulfur-containing copolymer onto reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to overcome the aforementioned challenges. The copolymerization was performed by heating elemental sulfur and isopropenylphenyl-functionalized RGO to afford a sulfur-containing copolymer, that is, RGO-g-poly(S-r-IDBI), which is featured by a high sulfur content and uniform distribution of the poly(S-r-IDBI) on RGO sheets. The covalent confinement of poly(S-r-IDBI) onto RGO sheets not only enhances the Li+ diffusion coefficients by nearly 1 order of magnitude, but also improves the mechanical properties of the cathodes and suppresses the shuttle effect of polysulfides. As a result, the RGO-g-poly(S-r-IDBI) cathode exhibits an enhanced sulfur utilization rate (10% higher than that of an elemental sulfur cathode at 0.1C), an improved rate capacity (688 mA h g(-1) for the RGO-g-poly(S-r-IDBI) cathode vs 400 mA h g(-1) for an elemental sulfur cathode at 1C), and a high cycling stability (a capacity decay of 0.021% per cycle, less than one-tenth of that measured for an elemental sulfur cathode).

However, the low conductivity and loss of active sulfur material during operation greatly limit the rating capabilities and cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, a unique sulfur host hybrid material comprising nanosized nickel sulfide (NiS) uniformly distributed on 3D carbon hollow spheres (C-HS) is fabricated using an in situ thermal reduction and sulfidation method. In the hybrid material, the nanosized NiS provides a high adsorption capability for polysulfides and the C-HS serves as a physical confinement for polysulfides and also a 3D electron transfer pathway. Moreover, NiS has strong chemical coupling with the C-HS, favoring fast charge transfer and redox kinetics of the sulfur electrode. With a sulfur loading of up to 2.3 mg cm(-2), the hybrid material-based lithium-sulfur batteries offer a capacity decay as low as 0.013% per cycle and a capacity of 695 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C after 300 cycles. This unique 3D hybrid material with strong chemical coupling provides a promising sulfur host for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, Li-S batteries present sluggish polysulfide intermediate redox kinetics due to the unavoidable "shuttle effect", thus hindering their industrialization and resulting in low sulfur utilization, rapid capacity fading, poor Coulombic efficiency, and anode corrosion. Herein, the present study updates a one-step hydrothermal method to synthesize a highly efficient sulfur host integrating three-dimensional porous graphene aerogel (GA) with uniformly dispersed defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets (200-300 nm) (GA-DR-MoS2). The electrochemical studies reveal that these MoS2 nanosheets with abundant defects could provide strong chemical adsorption for polysulfides, as well as act as an electrocatalyst to markedly accelerate polysulfide redox reactions during the charge/discharge process. The resultant GA-DR-MoS2 composites (70 wt % of sulfur loading) present a high initial discharge capacity of 1429 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, an outstanding cycling stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.085% per cycle over 500 cycles at 0.2C, and a superior rate performance with an improved capacity from 290 to 581 mAh g(-1) at 5C. The presented strategy is effective in achieving high-energy-density Li-S batteries from the point of electrocatalysis and facilitating their practical applications.

Surface oxidized mesoporous carbons derived from porous silicon as dual polysulfide confinement and anchoring cathodes in lithium sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium sulfur battery; Sulfur cathode; Mesoporous carbon; Porous silicon; Polysulfide immobilization	ELECTRODE; STABILITY; COMPOSITE; CAPACITY; OXIDE; HOST	Despite widespread focus on porous carbons for lithium-sulfur battery cathode materials, electrode design to preserve mass-specific performance and sustained extended cycling stability remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate electrochemically etched porous silicon as a sacrificial template to produce a new class of functional mesoporous carbons optimized for dual chemical and physical confinement of soluble polysulfides in lithium-sulfur battery cathodes. Melt infiltration loading of sulfur at 60 wt% enables initial discharge capacity of 1350 mAh/g(sulfur) at rates of 0.1 C - approaching theoretical capacity of 1675 mAh/g(sulfur). Cycling performance measured at 0.2 C indicates 81% capacity retention measured over 100 cycles with 830 mAh/g(sulfur) capacity. Unlike other carbons, this template combines structural properties necessary for sulfur containment and polysulfide confinement to achieve high specific capacity, but also boasts surface-bound oxygen-containing functional groups that are able to chemically anchor the soluble Li2Sn species on the interior of the mesoporous carbon to sustain cycling performance. In turn, this elucidates a scalable and competitive material framework that is capable, without the addition of additional membranes or inactive anchoring materials, of providing the simultaneous anchoring and confinement effects necessary to overcome performance limitations in lithium sulfur batteries.

However, some factors restrict their rapid development; for example, the dissolution and migration of polysulfides during the charge and discharge process, extremely poor conductivity of sulfur, and increase in volume. A glass fiber separator with graphene was loaded on a surface modified by excimer ultraviolet light (EUV/graphene separator) as the separator for Li-S batteries. The modified separator was irradiated by excimer ultraviolet light with graphene powder loaded on a glass fiber via vacuum filtration; this can effectively block polysulfide diffusion and improve the utilization rate of active materials when assembled into a Li-S battery. The first discharge specific capacity for this separator was as high as 1164 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C; after 300 cycles, the specific capacity was maintained at 640.5 mAh g(-1). This modified separator guarantees the efficient migration of lithium ions and effectively inhibits the shuttle effect of Li-S batteries. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We demonstrate here hydroxylated N-doped carbon nanotubes (H-NCNT) as sulfur containers in lithium-sulfur batteries to reduce polysulfide shuttling through an interaction between polysulfides and nitrogen and hydroxyl groups in the H-NCNT. This sulfur-carbon composite electrode with 2.2 mg cm(-2) sulfur displays excellent performance with high rate capability (initial capacity of 1341 mAh g(-1) at C/5 rate and 849 mAh g(-1) at 5C rate), rate stability until 500 cycles (a decay of 0.06% per cycle). Furthermore, a stable reversible capacity of as high as -1081 mAh g(-1) is realized with a higher sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their drawback still preventing major technical applications is the fading of capacity with the number of cycles. Here we introduce a linear four state model that is capable of describing the majority of the capacity fading curves of recently presented Li/S battery systems with different cathode materials (e.g. carbon, metal oxide and metals). Our approach models the discharge process as a Markov chain and consists of only four states that belong to three phases. The living phase comprises a stable and unstable state. The sleeping phase is converted into the living stable state and the dead phase represents the irreversible loss of living phase during the charge/discharge process. Despite its inherent simplicity this approach describes a broad variety of different systems. It gives detailed insights into the fading mechanisms of lithium sulfur cells. Moreover, it represents an easy-to-use tool for the quantitative assessment of a given system in terms of three figures of merit. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lithium-sulfur batteries are regarded as one of the most promising options for the next-generation energy storage applications because of their high theoretical energy and low cost. However, the electrochemical performances of lithium-sulfur batteries are seriously compromised by the polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling and the insulating nature of sulfur. To overcome these issues, novel CoNi1/3Fe2O4 (CNFO) nanoparticles uniformly covered on the carbon nanotubes are now reported as an efficient functional interlayer. Benefiting from the sufficient sulfiphilic sites of the CNFO for chemically bonding with LiPSs, as well as the conductive interconnected skeleton of carbon nanotubes, this composite material showed great enhancement on the rate capability and cycle stability of Li-S batteries. The Li-S battery using this interlayer exhibited a high initial capacity of 897 mA h g(-1) and a low capacity decay of 0.063% per cycle within 250 cycles at 2 C. Meanwhile, an reversible specific capacity of 869 mA h g(-1) (at 0.5 C) with high Coulombic efficiency could be obtained over 100 cycles at an elevated temperature (60 degrees C). We speculated that the chemical adsorption of CNFO for polysulfide-anchoring is extremely critical for the performances of Li-S batteries under high temperature.

Despite these advantages, the performance of Li-S batteries would need to be improved further for their wide dissemination in practical applications. Here, cobalt(II)-centered fluorinated phthalocyanine, namely, F-Co(II)Pc, is reported as a multi-functional component for sulfur cathodes with the following benefits: 1) enhanced conversion kinetics as a result of the catalytic effect of the cobalt(II) center, 2) efficient sulfur linkage via the fluorine functionality, which undergoes a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction, 3) suppression of the shuttling issue by the nitrogen atoms because of their strong affinity with polysulfides, and 4) the necessary aromaticity to engage in pi-pi interaction with reduced graphene oxide for electrical conductivity. The resulting electrode has promising electrochemical properties, such as sustainable cycling for 700 cycles and robust operation with a sulfur loading of 12 mg(sulfur) cm(-2), unveiling the promising nature of phthalocyanine and its related molecular families for advanced Li-S batteries.

This requires designing the electrode with the use of conductive agents to maintain the conductivity of the sulfur composite. Therefore, the composite of sulfur with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) was synthesized by heating. Following that, the mass loading of sulfur was increased by using several layers of carbon fiber paper (CFP) with a large free space as a three-dimensional current collector. As a result of the heat treatment and formation of covalent bonding between pyrolyzed PAN and sulfur, uniform distribution and enhanced conductivity were achieved, while CNT maintained structural integrity, acting as an interwoven network. Due to these advantages, the mass loading of sulfur was increased up to 5 mg cm(-2)while maintaining a high initial specific capacity of 1400 mAh g(-1)and stable cyclability.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is considered as one of the most promising candidate batteries due to its high theoretical energy density, low cost and non-toxicity. Despite many advantages associated with Li-S battery, it is hard to be applied to commercial-scale production owing to its shuttle effect, insulating nature, agglomeration of sulfur, polysulfide dissolution and fast capacity decay during charge-discharge process. To meet these challenges, numerous chaiacteristics of sulfur electrode have been designed, such as sufficient space to accommodate sulfur volume expansion, small dimensions of active material to avoid pulverization, and appropriate electrolyte additives to minimize the shuttle effect. According to previous studies, morphology of sulfur carriers has an important effect on electrochemical performances of Li-S battery. This review mainly aims at present status of different morphological sulfur carriers including carbon, metallic oxide, organic polymer and their composites, then summarizes their advantages, unresolved problems and common synthesis methods, respectively. At last, development and future prospects of Li-S battery are also presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, Li-S batteries suffer from internal issues, most of which is due to the shuttle effect that mitigates their commercial availability. In this work, TiO2/carbon composite is synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and used as interlayer to alleviate the shuttle effect. This interlayer is used without further pyrolysis in order not to lose the benefit of the functional groups of carbonaceous material which help in adsorbing polysulfides. Moreover, TiO(2)chemically binds polysulfides and boosts the adsorbing ability of the interlayer on polysulfides to a large extent. In consequence of this approach, 630 mAh/g discharge capacity is obtained after 100 cycles at C/5 current density. The adsorption ability of the interlayer ending up with enhanced electrochemical performance is proven by XPS with the significant shifts in binding energies.

Carbon soot over layered sulfur impregnated coconut husk derived carbon: An efficient polysulfide suppressor for lithium sulfur battery	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Candle soot; Coconut husk derived carbon; Lithium sulfur battery; Overlayer; Shuttling	POROUS CARBON; RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM; ACTIVATED CARBON; ANODE MATERIAL; BINDER-FREE; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; CATHODE; INTERLAYER; MEMBRANE	The present work introduces a facile strategy to develop an eco-friendly and inexpensive cathode material to accomplish the suppressing of polysulfide shuttle mechanism in lithium sulfur battery. The cathode design involves coconut husk derived carbon (CH) to host the insulating sulfur followed by a candle soot carbon over layer to barricade the lithium polysulfide dissolution to the electrolyte. The physical and electrochemical characterization clearly demonstrate the capability of CH to uphold the sulfur, therefore the cell could retain its reversible storage capacity without deteriorating the electrical contact with sulfur while cycling the cell. Further modification on sulfur impregnated carbon (SCH) by introducing a candle soot overlayer play the role of an ideal interlayer by assuring fast lithium ion diffusion and polysulfide blocking. Thus candle soot carbon coated SCH demonstrated an outstanding electrochemical performance and exhibited the capacity of 1347 mA h.g(-1) at 100 mA.g(-1) and retained the capacity of similar to 400 mA h.g(-1) even at a current density of as high as 5000 mA.g(-1).

However, the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfides as well as the slow redox kinetics constrains the development of Li-S batteries. Herein, carbon nanodots-decorated alveolate N, O, S tridoped hierarchical porous carbon (a-NOSPC) material is synthesized via facile pyrolysis of tobacco stem. The coexistence of micropores, mesopores, and macropore in the hierarchical porous carbon are beneficial for physical accommodating/immobilizing active materials sulfur and rapid charge/ion transfer. Meanwhile, the N, O, S dopants provide rich electrocatalytic active site in chemical binding of polysulfides and their accelerated redox kinetics, thus guaranteeing high utilization on active materials. The resultant a-NOSPC/S cathode with an 2.7 mg cm(-2) areal sulfur loading delivers a high reversible areal capacity of 2.90mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C, maintaining 2.01mAh cm(-2) over 100 cycles, which is obviously superior to the most reported biochar-based electrodes. Our results provide an appealing avenue to the design of multifunctional sulfur host for advanced Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we demonstrate that graphene foam impregnated with single-atom catalysts (SACs) can be coated on a commercial polypropylene separator to catalyze polysulfide conversion, leading to a reduced voltage gap and a much improved cycle life. Also, among Fe/Co/Ni SACs, Fe SACs may be a better option to be used in Li-S systems. By deploying SACs in the battery separator, cycling stability improves hugely, especially considering relatively high sulfur loading and ultralow SAC contents. Even at a metal loading of similar to 2 mu g in the whole cell, an Fe SAC-modified separator delivers superior Li-S battery performance even at high sulfur loading (891.6 mAh g(-1), 83.7% retention after 750 cycles at 0.5C). Our work further enriches and expands the application of SACs catalyzing polysulfide blocking and conversion and improving round trip efficiencies in batteries, without side effects such as electrolyte and electrode decomposition.

But Li-S batteries still have some problems for practical application, such as low sulfur utilization and dissatisfactory capacity retention. Herein, we designed and fabricated a foldable and compositionally heterogeneous three-dimensional sulfur cathode with integrated sandwich structure. The electrical conductivity of the cathode is facilitated by three different dimension carbons, in which short-distance and long-distance pathways for electrons are provided by zero-dimensional ketjen black (KB), one-dimensional activated carbon fiber (ACF) and two-dimensional graphene (G). The resultant three-dimensional sulfur cathode (T-AKG/KB@S) with an areal sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2) exhibits a high initial specific capacity, superior rate performance and a reversible discharge capacity of up to 726 mAh g(-1) at 3.6 mA cm(-2) with an inappreciable capacity fading rate of 0.0044% per cycle after 500 cycles. Moreover, the cathode with a high areal sulfur loading of 8 mg cm(-2) also delivers a reversible discharge capacity of 938 mAh g(-1) at 0.71 mA cm(-2) with a capacity fading rate of 0.15% per cycle and a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100% after 50 cycles.

It has been revealed that the appropriate additions of CeO2 (0.70-3.65 wt%) to the porous carbon were beneficial to enhance the cycle performance. The polar metal oxide CeO2 can chemically adsorb the sulfur species and promote redox reaction through catalysis properties. Meanwhile, the porous carbon can enhance the conductivity of cathode and form a favorable physical barrier to block the diffusion of polysulfide with abundant pore structures. As results, the CS-CeO2 composite (with 1.84 wt% CeO2) exhibits significantly improved electrochemical performance as a cathode material for Li-S batteries. The initial discharge capacity of assembled battery is as high as 1434.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C and the discharge capacity retains 873.6 mAh g(-1) with a low decay rate of 0.077% per cycle after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. When the area sulfur content is as high as 4.53 mg cm(-2), the CS-Ce2 cathode still retains a discharge capacity of 572.3 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 100 cycles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that PCNS-S@PANI exhibits excellent charge-discharge performances as cathode of lithium-sulfur battery: delivering a discharge capacity of 881 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C (1 C = 1672 mA g(-1)) with a capacity retention of 72 % after 100 cycles and a rate capacity of 324 mAh g(-1) at 2 C. These natures can be attributed to the co-contribution of PCNS and conductive PANI to the improvement in electronic conductivity and chemical stability of sulfur cathode.

Here we report a novel cathode consisting of a sulfur@TiO2/polypyrrole (S@TiO2/PPy) composite, in which sulfur is encapsulated by TiO2 hollow spheres and then loaded on a PPy nanowire matrix together. The S@TiO2/PPy cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries deliver an excellent electrochemical performance with a high initial specific capacity of 1385.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a low decay rate of 0.047 % per cycle at 1 C. The enhanced property of S@TiO2/PPy composites maybe derived from a synergistic reaction on sulfur between TiO2 hollow spheres and conductive polypyrrole nanowires, which plays a vital role on inhibiting the shuttle effect and improving the conductivity of sulfur cathodes through encapsulating sulfur active materials, chemical adsorbing polysulfides and mixing the conductive component. The architectural design on S@TiO2/PPy cathodes will provide a promising route for the practical usage of lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The hierarchical porous structure of the HPNCF consists of both micro- and mesopores. The micropores can effectively confine and inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides, whereas the mesopores can effectively accommodate sulfur and provide sufficient space for volume expansion that occurs during the lithiation process. Nitrogen-doped carbon matrix not only can improve the wettability and accessibility of the electrolyte, but also strengthen the chemical interaction between polysulfides and carbon. In this study, a synthesized carbon matrix (HPNCF) was loaded with a high sulfur content (73%) and delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 1630 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with a retention capacity of 1325 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles. Even at a high C-rate of 1 C, the capacity retention of 840 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles was achieved. The outstanding electrochemical performance of HPNCF/S composite was attributed to the efficient utilization of elemental sulfur and the confinement of polysulfides by the hierarchical porous structure as well as chemical adsorption by nitrogen doping. Therefore, HPNCF/S composite is expected to be a superior cathode material used to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries.

Herein, a novel 2D/1D V2O5 nanoplates anchored carbon nanofiber (V-CF) interlayer coated on standard polypropylene (PP) separator is constructed, and a stabilization mechanism derived from a quasi-confined cushion space (QCCS) that can flexibly accommodate the polysulfide utilization is demonstrated. The incorporation of the V-CF interlayer ensures stable electron and ion pathway, and significantly enhanced long-term cycling performances are obtained. A Li-S battery assembled with the V-CF membrane exhibited a high initial capacity of 1140.8 mAh.g(-1) and a reversed capacitance of 1110.2 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. A high reversible capacity of 887.2 mAh.g(-1) is also maintained after 500 cycles at 1 C, reaching an ultra-low decay rate of 0.0093% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical properties, especially the long-term cycling stability, can offer a promising designer protocol for developing highly stable Li-S batteries by introducing well-designed fine architectures to the separator.

Nevertheless, the unsatisfied performance in terms of poor discharge capacity and cycling stability still hinders its practical applications. Recently, porous carbon materials have been widely reported as promising sulfur reservoirs to promote the sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur conversion, tolerate volume expansion of sulfur, and suppress polysulfide shuttling. However, porous carbon with a simply designed nanostructure is hard to satisfy all of these aspects simultaneously. Herein, we have applied a dual-template strategy that assembles carbon pores into carbon sheets to prepare three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (N-PCSs) as the multifunctional sulfur host for the Li-S battery. By arranging carbon pores within an interconnected 3D architecture, the porous carbon sheets enable rapid electron/ion transfer. Moreover, the micro/mesopores and nitrogen dopant in N-PCS provide both physical and chemical restrictions to polysulfide species. With these advances, the N-PCS/S cathode delivers a large initial discharge capacity of 1360 mA h/g at 0.1 C. When performed at 0.5 C for 1000 cycles, the cathode can still remain similar to 50% of its capacity with a low decay rate of 0.05% per cycle, showing the important role of the 3D carbon material in the Li-S battery.

However, the poor electronic conductivity, large volume change, and shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode seriously hinder the commercial application of LSBs. Herein, a graphene-modified mesoporous amorphous FePO4 (G/FP) binary host is synthesized using a mild one-step hydrothermal method. The FePO4 (FP) component with strong polarity plays a crucial role in chemical adsorption and conversion of polysulfides, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect during the cycle process. The graphene (G) framework ensures the electronic conductivity and physically adsorbs polysulfides to improve the utilization of active sulfur. The reasonable porous structure of the G/FP matrix guarantees fast Li+ transport and more electrochemical reactive sites, thereby enabling the excellent electrochemical performance of the G/FP/S cathode. The prepared G/FP/S cathode with a high initial discharge specific capacity of 1469.5 mAh g(-1) delivers a stable capacity of 840.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 300 cycles and 656.7 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C after 800 cycles as well as an excellent rate performance (651.8 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C) at a relatively large sulfur loading of 3.1 mg cm(-2).

The flexible film is used as interlayer between separator and sulfur cathode to entrap active materials and prevent polysulfide shuttle. The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery furnished with an optimal GO/CNT interlayer delivers an excellent reversible capacity of 671 mA h/g after 300 cycles with a low degradation rate of 0.33 mA h/g or 0.043% per cycle at 0.2C. The encouraging outcome arises from synergistic effects of interlayer characteristics: namely, (i) the porous structure facilitates easy ion transport and electrolyte penetration; (ii) the GO layers with oxygenated functional groups entrap active materials, preventing polysulfide shuttle and enhancing their recycling; and (iii) the highly conductive CNTs offer fast pathways for electron/ion transfer.

Herein, a readily available cobalt-embedded carbon nanofiber (Co-CNF) is designed as the current collector for sulfur cathodes. It is shown that the Co-CNF promotes electron and Li-ion transfer, thus leading to fast redox conversion, which mitigates the dissolution and shuttling of polysulfides. Furthermore, the embedded cobalt metal facilitates the uniform nucleation of lithium sulfide on the surface of the carbon nanofiber, which reduces the polarization and leads to high specific capacity. The Co-CNF with 4.6 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading delivers 970 mA h g(-1) (4.5 mA h cm(-2)) at 0.1 C and 670 mA h g(-1) at 1 C. Even when sulfur loading reaches as high as 9.6 mg cm(-2), the reversible capacity of 730 mA h g(-1) (7 mA h cm(-2)) is obtained. The Co-CNF/Li2S6 cathode shows a degradation rate at 0.06% per cycle over 300 cycles. This work demonstrates the effect of cobalt metal catalysis and a simple but useful sulfur cathode design for high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Highly porous, nitrogen-doped carbons as conductive host structures for sulfur/lithium sulfide deposition are shown herein to play a critical role in reversible cycling at low electrolyte/sulfur ratio. The pore geometry is precisely controlled by an efficient, scalable ZnO hard templating process. By using an electrolyte volume as low as 4 mu L mg(S)(-1) , the beneficial nitrogen functionality leads to a twofold increased cell lifetime turning our findings highly favorable for real applications. Stable cycling of up to 156 cycles (59 cycles with undoped carbon) with high sulfur loadings of 3 mg cm(-2) is achieved. Operando X-ray diffraction measurements during cycling show the transformation pathway of the sulfur - polysulfide - Li2S species. The observed intermediates critically depend on the nitrogen doping in the cathode carbon matrix. Nitrogen-doped carbons facilitate polysulfide adsorption promoting the nucleation of crystalline Li2S. These results provide new insights into the significant role of heteroatom doping for carbons in Li-S batteries with high specific energy.

However, the sluggish conversion and shuttling effect of polysulfides restrict their practicality. Here we rationally design the multi-cavity hollow carbon spheres doped with atomic Fe-N sites (Fe-N/MCHCS) as physically/chemically double-confined catalytic nanoreactors for the efficient sulfur host materials. The Fe-N/MCHCS with hierarchical porous structure and high pore volume ensures the high loading mass, and the multi-cavity structures significantly buffer the volume expansion of sulfur and enhance the electronic contact. Meanwhile, atomic Fe offers chemical binding site and efficiently catalyzes the conversion of polysulfides during cycling, thus immobilizing and alleviating the shutting effect of polysulfides. Consequently, the Fe-N/MCHCS nanoreactor based Li-S batteries deliver a long cycling life of 1135 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5 C and high-rate capability of 1055 mAh g(-1) at 8 C. Even under practical conditions with a high sulfur mass loading of 5.0 mg cm(-2), a steady areal capacity of 4.85 mAh cm(-2) is attained. This strategy combing multi-cavity hollow carbon with single atom catalysis opens a reliable route to design highly stable and high-performance Li S batteries.

Here, a nano-TiO2 decorated carbon layer (T-DCL) has been successfully applied to modify separator for the Li-S battery. The results indicate that appropriate weight percentage of nano-TiO2 uniformly distributed in conductive carbon layer is effective to chemically and physically immobilize for LiPS, and promote the electron transfer during discharge/charge process. The performance of the modified Li-S battery with T-DCL separator are significantly enhanced, with a specific capacity of 883 mAh g(-1) retained after 180 cycles at 0.1 C and 762 mAh g(-1) retained after 200 cycles at 0.5C, which are much higher than that of separators only coated with TiO2 layer or conductive carbon layer. Besides, the separator coated with T-DCL also shows low electrochemical impedance and good lithium anode protection. These results indicate that separator with T-DCL is promising to balance the physical and chemical LIPS trapping effect, and optimize the electrochemical performance for Li-S battery.

However, the commonly employed ether based electrolyte does not enable to realize safe high-temperature Li-S batteries due to the low boiling and flash temperatures. Traditional carbonate based electrolyte obtains safe physical properties at high temperature but does not complete reversible electrochemical reaction for most Li-S batteries. Here we realize safe high temperature Li-S batteries on universal carbon-sulfur electrodes by molecular layer deposited (MLD) alucone coating. Sulfur cathodes with MLD coating complete the reversible electrochemical process in carbonate electrolyte and exhibit a safe and ultrastable cycle life at high temperature, which promise practicable Li-S batteries for electric vehicles and other large-scale energy storage systems.

Here, unique three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-coated ultrathin zinc-cobalt oxide composite N-doped carbon self-supporting stratified porous nanosheet arrays, anchored on flexible carbon cloths (CCs) (rGO-S/ZnCo2O4@NC/CCs), are designed and chosen as independent cathodes. A lithium-sulfur battery using rGO-S/ZnCo2O4@NC/CC as the cathode exhibits a high capacity of around 1377.8 mAh g(-1) and retains an outstanding capacity of around 1006.3 mAh g(-1) after 700 cycles at 0.1 C with a sulfur loading of 2.2 mg cm(-2). Moreover, even under a high sulfur load of 8.2 mg cm(-2), a superior capacity of 735.9 mAh g(-1) can be achieved at 0.1 C. In this work, a special function and a 3D self-supporting stratified porous nanostructure with a conductive rGO coating have been designed, which reasonably alleviate the "shuttle effect" of high-load Li-S batteries through the "internal and external double repair" action.

However, the migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and slow electrochemical reaction kinetics are still the intractable problems on the development of Li-S batteries. Herein, novel Ni/Ni2P@C hollow heterostructure microsphere, as the functional sulfur host material, is prepared by a facile approach. The study found that the novel hollow microsphere composed of porous carbon layer alleviates the volume expansion effect and effectively improves the electron transport during cycling process. In addition, the Ni/Ni2P heterostructure wrapped in carbon layer not only improves the adsorption of LiPSs, but also catalyzes their conversion reactions. Therefore, Li-S batteries with the S/Ni/Ni2P@C electrode exhibit high discharge capacity of 1187.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C in the first cycle, notable rate capability of 716.9 mAh g(-1) at 3 C and outstanding reversible capacity of 636.6 mAh g(-1) over the 500 cycles at 1 C. Owing to these excellent electrochemical performances, the Ni/Ni2P@C hollow heterostructure microsphere has promising applications for Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It indicates that the activated carbon (AC(pe)) derived from peanut shell owns flat, narrow and long shape macroporous structure with large micropores on its surface and is more suitable for the reaction in the Li-S battery. The AC(pe)/S composite containing about 57 wt% sulfur (sulfur loading of 0.83 mg cm(- 2)) shows a best initial discharge capacity of 943 mAhg(- 1) at the rate of 0.2 C. It still retains a comparably high specific capacity of 619 mAh g(- 1) with a coulombic efficiency of 95% after 100 cycles. This fact implies that the inherent flat pore construction of AC(pe) is beneficial for keep cycling stability for the lithium sulfur battery.

We report a powerful strategy for integrated fabrication of sulfur impregnated into three-dimensional (3D) multileveled carbon nanoflake-nanosphere networks (CNNNs) by means of sacrificial ZnO template plus glucose carbonization. The multileveled CNNNs are not only utilized as large-area host/backbone for sulfur forming an integrated S/CNNNs composite electrode, but also serve as multiple carbon blocking barriers (nanoflake infrastructure andnanosphere superstructure) to physically confine polysulfides at the cathode. The designedself-supported S/CNNNs composite cathodes exhibit superior electrochemical performances with high capacities (1395 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, and 769 mAh g(-1) at 5.0C after 200 cycles) and noticeable cycling performance (81.6% retention after 200 cycles). Our results build a new bridge between sulfur and carbon networks with multiple blocking effects for polysulfides, and provide references for construction of other high-performance sulfur cathodes.

The most widely adopted strategy aimed for improved energy density has been tailoring the microscopic structure of sulfur cathode materials to address fundamental challenges, which is, however, inadequate for the stabilization of the macroscopic cathode structure. Here, we propose a micro-macroscopic coupled electrode architecture comprising commercially available carbon nanotubes through a simple self-assembly and freeze-casting method. The microscopic structure of carbon nanotubes enables homogeneous accommodation of sulfur, and the self-assembled macroscopic interconnected framework provides abundant and interconnected channels for boosted transport of both electrons and lithium ions and well-localized polysulfide intermediates. With the use of the same carbon nanotube material, the micro-macroscopic coupled electrode shows obviously enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of high capacity and long cycle life as well as high sulfur loading, compared to a conventionally prepared electrode. This work sheds light on an avenue for achieving high-performance sulfur cathodes by demonstrating the effectiveness of macroscopic electrode design beyond complex design of microscopic material structures, which may be applicable in other battery systems.

However, dissolution of polysulfides during cycling still hinder the marketing of Li-S batteries. Here, we prepared NiO nanosheets on carbon cloth as a hierarchical structured cathode for Li-S battery by a simple chemical bath method. The cathode contains interconnected mesoporous, in which the highly exposed surface of NiO nanosheets can provide active sites for chemical interaction towards polysulfides. The battery using the hierarchical structured cathode can deliver a high capacity of 1008.8 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2). At a higher current density of 2 mA cm(-2), an initial capacity of 661.9 mAh g(-1) is achieved and a reversible capacity 520 mAh g(-1) is remained after 300 cycles, demonstrating the great potential of NiO nanosheets grown on flexible carbon cloth as cathode for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The electrode with 6.1 wt% RuO2 nanocrystals and a high sulfur content of 79.0 wt% delivers an optimal electrochemical performance with high residual capacities of 508 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles and 389 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles at 1 C with a low capacity decay of 0.054%. The RuO2 nanocrystals promote the redox reaction kinetics and facilitate the transformation of sulfur chemistry, leading to large improvements in reversibility and rate capability of the composite electrode. The density functional theory calculations signify the formation of Li-O and Ru-S bonds through chemical interactions between RuO2 and Li polysulfides while the adsorption energies between graphene and polysulfide species are much higher in the presence of RuO2 than that of the neat graphene acting alone. These discoveries support the efficient entrapment of polysulfides by the composite electrode to the benefit of enhanced cyclic stability of the battery.

Here we rationally design a new self-standing host enabled by a 3D hierarchically-porous titanium monoxide-graphene composite film to overcome the two issues at once. The hierarchically porous graphene scaffold not only can facilitate rapid lithium ion and electron transport, but also provide sufficient spaces to accommodate sulfur and buffer the volume expansion during the lithiation process. In addition, the ultrafine and polar titanium monoxide nanoparticles embedded in the three-dimensional graphene networks show strong chemical anchoring for polysulfides as evidenced by ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, and their inherent metallic conductivity accelerates the redox reaction kinetics. Benefiting from this attractive architecture, the freestanding titanium monoxide-graphene/sulfur cathode delivered a high initial capacity of 1350 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, a Coulombic efficiency approaching 100%, and a high-rate capacity of 832 mAh g(-1) at 2 C. Moreover, when the areal sulfur loading was increased to 5.2 mg cm(-2), the titanium monoxide-graphene/sulfur electrode delivered a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm(-2) after 300 cycles at 0.2 C, demonstrating excellent cycling performance compared with other recently reported sulfur cathodes with high areal sulfur loadings.

Nevertheless, the practical application of LSBs still faces several hazards, including the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides, low electrical conductivities of solid sulfur and lithium sulfides, and large volume expansion during charge/discharge cycles. To address this critical challenge, we innovatively proposed facile synthesis of nanostructured VN quantum dots (VNQD)/holey graphene matrix for stabilizing the sulfur cathode by simultaneously promoting the trapping, anchoring, and catalyzing efficiencies of both LiPSs and Li2S. Benefiting from abundant edge catalytic sites of VNQD, in-plane nanopores of graphene, and high electrical conductivity, the sulfur host not only provides high adsorption capability toward soluble polysulfides, strong binding ability for anchoring solid Li2S, and their rapid conversion kinetics but also contributes abundant sulfur storage sites and efficient transport pathways for lithium ions (Li+) and electrons. Consequently, the sulfur cathode exhibits high initial capacities of 1320 mAh g(-1), high rate capability (850 mAh g(-1) @ 4 mA cm(-2)), and high capacity retention of 99.95% per cycle after 500 cycles, providing a feasible solution for the practical utilization of shuttle-free Li-S batteries.

However, LSB is constrained by their inherent shortcomings containing notorious shuttle effect and poor conductivity of sulfur and discharge products (Li2S/Li2S). In order to overcome these obstacles, flower-shaped bismuth titanate embedded with carbon nanotubes (BTO/CNT) is designed as efficient sulfur host materials. The BTO/CNT composites can provide abundant voidage to support the sulfur, and its large contact surface can accelerate the catalytic transformation of lithiumsulfide. Importantly, bismuth titanate (BTO) as ferroelectric materials can spontaneously polarize to induce an inner electric field, which can not only accelerate the lithium polysulfides (LiPS) conversion due to its catalytic activity, but also enhance the chemical interaction for heteropolar LiPS based on the Lewis acid and bases interaction to alleviate the shuttle effect of LSB. Furthermore, the embedded CNT constructs a conductive network greatly improving electrode electrical conductivity. In view of these advantages, BTO/CNT as sulfur host delivers impressive cyclic stability with attenuation rate of 0.037% per cycle capacity over 1000 cycles with sulfur loading around 1.0 mg cm(-2) at 1 C, suggesting enormous potential for excellent-performance Li-S batteries.

To address these stumbling blocks, we introduced a highly dense fractal-like candle soot (CS) carbon cloud on the three-dimensional (3D) glass fiber paper as an interlayer that adsorbs and provides sufficient sites for Li-polysulfide accommodation. The interlayer also retains the electrolyte with soluble Li-polysulfides and converts them into insoluble lower-order polysulfide (Li2S and Li2S2) without losing the electrical contact. Li-S cell is fabricated with activated candle soot (ACS) and sulfur (S) composite (ACS-S) as an electrode material. The candle soot-glass fiber interlayer (CS_IL) attained a high initial discharge capacity of 1139 mAh g-1 at a 0.5C rate and displayed excellent cyclic stability with reversible capacity of 865 mAh g-1 at the current rate of 2C for 100 cycles with coulombic efficiency of 95%. Further, the same cell was tested at a high charge/discharge rate of 7C, and exhibit excellent reversible capacity of 485 mAh g-1 with a long life of 400 cycle and high coulombic efficiency of 95%. The overall improvement of Li-S battery also evident with impedance analysis, H-cell adsorption testing, and shuttle factor calculations.

The modified separator was fabricated by the vacuum filtration method using the exfoliation TiO(2)NSs and untreated carbon nanotube (CNT) composites. The multi-functional TiO2NS/CNT coating not only reduced the electrochemical resistance but also localized the migrating polysulfides by the cooperative effect of physical adsorption and chemical binding. Specifically, the composition ratio of TiO(2)NSs/CNTs and the interface character have been studied. It was found that the optimum ratio and perfect electrolyte wettability of the TiO2NS/CNT layers were all the critical reasons to achieve good battery performance. The high initial discharge capacity of 1247 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C rate, which was 75% of the theoretical capacity of sulfur, 98% average coulombic efficiency, and 627 mA h g(-1) discharge capacity retention after 100 cycles were obtained with the TiO2NS/CNT coating separator.

The nanopore ZnS-CA composites with a high specific surface area and rich mesoporous structure exhibit stronger adsorption and immobilization ability for polysulfides. The ZnS-CA/S cathode materials offer excellent electrochemical performances with lasting cycling stability and high specific capacity. In particular, the 6ZnS-CA/S sample achieves an initial capacity of 1352mAhg(-1) at 0.2C and maintains a high capacity of 1119mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles. Furthermore, after 300 long cycles, it still maintains a high capacity of 730mAhg(-1) at 1C. These excellent performance features are attributed to the strong affinity of ZnS for Li2Sn species, thus polysulfide shuttling can be effectively inhibited from the cathode source. Furthermore, the strong adsorption energy between ZnS and polysulfides was validated by using first-principles theory calculations, which reveals the anchoring and catalytic mechanism.

The rich protein in pomegranate residues provides nitrogen sources for the N-doped HPC. The influence of carbonization temperatures on the microstructure and performance of HPC has been investigated. In comparison to the HPC-700 and HPC-800, the HPC-600 sample has the highest BET surface area of 2064.32 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 1.12 cm(3) g(-1). When tested in Li-S batteries, the as-prepared HPC/S-600 cathode with loading sulfur content of 71.54 wt% shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1010 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C, and the reversible capacity retains 550 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles. The high cycling stability of HPC/S electrode is attributed to the synergistic effect of hierarchical porous structure and N-doping, which can provide strong physical and chemical confinement to sulfur and the soluble lithium polysulphides.

The results indicate that the hydroxyl content decreases from 35.8% to 17.9% with prolonging reduction time from 6 h to 48 h, and the C/O ratio increases. More importantly, it is demonstrated that the rGO with relatively low hydroxyl content within 36 h of reduction is more beneficial to enhance both the initial capacity and capacity retention as well as rate performance of LSBs, which is ascribed to the higher conductivity, stronger adsorption and relatively few reaction by-products with the decrease of hydroxyl content. However, when the reduction time is further prolonged to 48 h, the cathode performance deteriorates. As a result, rGO-36h/S electrode with the optimum hydroxyl content (19.2%) achieves an initial discharge capacity of 1340.9 mAh g(-1), which still maintains 707.8 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.1C. This work may provide a guide for reducing GO when used as sulfur host material or matrix material of LSBs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we successfully prepared an in-situ nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheet (NPCN) materials derived from renewable silk cocoon via a facile simultaneous activation and carbonization approach using metal salt FeCI3 and ZnCl2 as chemical activating agent. The as-prepared carbon materials were fully characterized to determine their morphology and structure features, and it was found that the obtained NPCN has a unique interconnected sheet-like morphology and a hierarchically porous structure with a relatively high specific surface area of 1540 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 1.85 cm(3) g(-1). Owing to the inherent nitrogen-containing functional groups existing in the silk cocoon, in-situ doping of nitrogen heteroatom can be realized by the carbonization treatment, which can efficiently boost the electrical conductivity of the porous carbon nanosheets. By employing the NPCP as a reservoir to impregnate sulfur for lithium-sulfur batteries, the resulting carbon/sulfur composite (NPCN/S) shows a remarkably improved rate performance and superior long-term cycling stability With an extremely low decay rate (0.1% per cycle) up to 300 cycles at a high rate of 2C (3350 mAg(-1)). What is more, a Coulombic efficiency of approximatively 100% is obtained. Taking into consideration various factors including sustainable development, low-cost carbon source, and facile mass production, this work shows a great scientific significance and promising prospect in scalable preparation of advanced carbon-based host matrix for the efficient immobilization of sulfur towards developing high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

The issue of fragileness for electrode at high sulfur loading density is mitigated by replacing carbon black with fine graphite powders. With these optimizations the carbon sulfur electrode gives an energy density of 5.88 mW h cm(-2) which corresponds to 60% of that of the commercial LiCoO2 electrode. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, the commercial application of lithium-sulfur batteries is now impeded by the "shuttle effect" of soluble polysulfides. Herein, we demonstrate that the polysulfides can be effectively confined to the phosphorous/oxygen co-doped mesoporous carbon bowls (P/O-MCB) via the strong electrostatic dipole-dipole interaction. Different from other doping methods, the P2O5 can not only be used as the phosphorous and oxygen sources for co-doping, but also generate enormous pressure difference on the surface of hollow mesoporous carbon sphere under the action of surface tension, leading to the formation of porous bowl-like morphology. Benefiting from the P/O co-doping, high surface area, and unique bowl-like morphology, the S@P/O-MCB electrode delivers an initial capacity of 897 mAh g(-1) at 1C and retains a reversible capacity of 489 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles. More importantly, the S@P/O-MCB electrode shows an outstanding areal capacity of 5.5 mAh cm(-2) at a high sulfur loading of 5.02 mg cm(-2).

Sulfur-based cathodes must not only be highly conductive to enhance the utilization of sulfur, but also effectively confine polysulfides to mitigate their dissolution. A new physical and chemical entrapment strategy is based on a highly efficient sulfur host, namely hollow carbon nanofibers (HCFs) filled with MnO2 nanosheets. Benefiting from both the HCFs and birnessite-type MnO2 nanosheets, the MnO2@HCF hybrid host not only facilitates electron and ion transfer during the redox reactions, but also efficiently prevents polysulfide dissolution. With a high sulfur content of 71wt% in the composite and an areal sulfur mass loading of 3.5mgcm(-2) in the electrode, the MnO2@HCF/S electrode delivered a specific capacity of 1161mAhg(-1) (4.1mAhcm(-2)) at 0.05C and maintained a stable cycling performance at 0.5C over 300cycles.

However, it is hard to get a satisfactory performance due to the low conductivity of sulfur, the volume changes from sulfur to lithium sulfides during the cycling, and the shuttle effect of the intermediate product of polysulfides. Here, we propose a sulfur host material based on the composite of conductive metal-organic frameworks (Ni-3(HITP)(2)) and graphene oxide. This composite material combines the unique pore structure of Ni-3(HITP)(2) and the improved conductivity. The stacked one-dimensional channels could effectively improve the utilization of S, and the good conductivity could enhance the charge transfer of the electrode. The rich Lewis acid sites of Ni-3(HITP)(2) could effectively adsorb the polysulfides around the open metal sites that help suppress the shuttle effects. This rational design improves the rate performance and cycle stability of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the polysulfide dissolution and low electronic conductivity of sulfur cathodes limit the practical application of Li-S batteries. To address such issues, well-designed yolk-shelled carbon@Fe3O4 (YSC@Fe3O4) nanoboxes as highly efficient sulfur hosts for Li-S batteries are reported here. With both physical entrapment by carbon shells and strong chemical interaction with Fe3O4 cores, this unique architecture immobilizes the active material and inhibits diffusion of the polysulfide intermediates. Moreover, due to their high conductivity, the carbon shells and the polar Fe3O4 cores facilitate fast electron/ion transport and promote continuous reactivation of the active material during the charge/discharge process, resulting in improved electrochemical utilization and reversibility. With these merits, the S/YSC@Fe3O4 cathodes support high sulfur content (80 wt%) and loading (5.5 mg cm(-2)) and deliver high specific capacity, excellent rate capacity, and long cycling stability. This work provides a new perspective to design a carbon/metal-oxide-based yolk-shelled framework as a high sulfur-loading host for advanced Li-S batteries with superior electrochemical properties.

J	Wang, JN; Jin, J; Wen, ZY				Wang Jianing; Jin Jun; Wen Zhaoyin			Application of Separators Modified by Carbon Nanospheres Enriched with alpha-MoC1-x Nanocrystalline in Lithium Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF INORGANIC MATERIALS			Chinese	Article						lithium sulfur battery; shuttle effect; molybdenum carbide; sulfur cathode	LI-S BATTERY; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; SITES	Carbon nanospheres enriched with alpha-MoC1-x, nanocrystalline (alpha-MoC1-x/CNS) were synthesized by self-assembly and applied as a mediator for the surface of commercial polypropylene (PP) separator. Compared with pristin PP separator, the cycling stability and rate performance of the lithium-sulfur batteries with the modified alpha-MoC1-x/CNS-PP separator are significantly improved and the battery with alpha-MoC1-x/CNS-PP separator exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1129.7 mAh/g at 0.5C and retains 855.5 mAh/g after 100 cycles with above 98% Coulombic efficiency. Remarkably, the capacity loss rate is only 7.7% after 48 h static storage. Combined with the morphology and XPS analysis of alpha-MoC1-x/CNS, it is found that the designed alpha-MoC1-x/CNS-PP separator prevents the migration of lithium polysulfide to the anode during the process of charge and discharge in lithium sulfur batteries. Formations of Mo-S bonds, thiosulfate and polythionate are attributed to the contact between lithium polysulfide and alpha-MoC1-x/CNS, which further restrains active material in cathode region and improves the performance of lithiumsulfur batteries consequently.

One of the most challenging issues impeding their practical application is how to develop cost-effective thick sulfur cathode with fast kinetics. Carbon aerogels (CAs) show great potential as host for lithium-sulfur batteries, while the preparation of CAs usually requires special time-consuming drying techniques to retain their porous structure. In this work, we develop a facile method to tailor the flexible structure of the CAs by simply using NaCl, leading to a more stable porous structure that resists the collapse of pores during conventional drying process. High gravimetric and areal sulfur loading can be realized in the synthesized hierarchically porous carbon aerogel electrode. With 69 wt% and over 6 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading on the cathode, the cell delivers an initial capacity of 1121 mA h g(-1) and a reversible capacity of 797 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles under the current density of 0.2 C.

The synergistic effect between CoMoS313 and SnO2 leads to high capacity, cyclability and rate capability. The reversible capacity of hierarchical CoMoS313/SnO2 nanocomposites is up to 770 mA h g(-1) at 0.3C rate (similar to 3 h per half cycle) and maintains 718 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles, much higher than that of pure CoMoS313 nanosheets. And the diffusion of lithium polysulfide can be restrained by SnO2 nanoparticles shell, avoiding the loss of material during cycling. The present results indicate that hierarchical CoMoS313/SnO2 nanocomposites are good candidates for the cathode of Li-S battery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When used as cathode for lithium-sulfur battery, the S/GN/CNT composite can be pressed directly onto nickel foam without binder and conductive additive, thereby simplifying the manufacturing process. The resulting S/GN/CNT composite exhibited high and stable-specific discharge capacities of 670 mAh g(-1) after 80 cycles at 0.2 C and good rate capability. This enhanced electrochemical performance could be attributed to the combinative effects of GN and CNT, which not only function as a flexible conductive matrix, favoring the ion transport and electrolyte diffusion, but also for provide a porous three-dimensional architecture with open channels to effectively confine the soluble polysulfides.

Herein, a series of semi-graphitic ordered mesoporous carbons with metal/nitrogen doping (Me-N-GOMCs; Me = Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) are designed as sulfur hosts with abundant porosity and high electrical conductivity. It is revealed that the carbon capability of anchoring polysulfides can be remarkably enhanced through the synergistic effect of Fe and N doping. Moreover, by implanting the Fe-N-GOMC/S composite within the void space of carbon papers (CPs), free-standing integrated sulfur cathodes with the architecture of a continuous conductive 3D network are constructed. The robust ion/electron transport and redox kinetics enable Li-S batteries with excellent sulfur utilization at high loading. The as-acquired CP/Fe-N-GOMC/S electrode with a sulfur loading of similar to 3 mg cm(-2) exhibits a high initial capacity of 1473 mA h g(-1) and superior cycle stability with a capacity fading as low as 0.075% per cycle over 500 cycles at 0.5C. Even at a sulfur loading up to similar to 6 mg cm(-2), the electrode still achieves a steady areal capacity (similar to 5 mA h cm(-2)) for over 120 cycles at 1C.

However, the very limited lifespan and rate performance of Li-S systems originating from dissolution and diffusion of long-chain polysulfides in liquid electrolytes, as well as the intrinsic poor conductivity of sulfur, severely hinder their practical application. Herein, an electrospinning and subsequent dipping and drying method is developed here to fabricate a duplex architecture consisting of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer and BaTiO3 (BTO)-decorated carbon nanofibers (BTO@CNFs), and it is used as a multifunctional interlayer for Li-S batteries. The 3D interwoven CNFs with conductive pathways for both electrons and ions can enhance the contact between polysulfides with BTO nanoparticles and promote the reuse of inactivated sulfur. Additionally, the ferroelectric BTO nanoparticles adhered on CNFs can realize a highly robust trapping to polysulfides via the extremely polar interaction. Moreover, the surface rGO layer can act as a textural barrier to intercept the shuttling polysulfides. Consequently, the modified Li-S batteries with the rGO/BTO@CNF interlayer deliver superior electrochemical performance of 865 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.3 C and a rate capability of 672 mAh g(-1) at 3 C.

Because of the unique multi-hole, thin sheets cluster and irregular wrinkled surface coexisting structure, the shaddock wadding carbon-sulfur (SWD-S) composite can be used as a kind of cathode material for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries by loading element sulfur into the shaddock wadding activated carbon via simple heat treatments. Because of the high specific surface area of SWD (1637.3 m(2) g(-1)), the SWD-S composite has a sulfur content about 73.7 wt%, and delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1050 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.2C. Moreover, SWD-S composite exhibits a good rate capacity and excellent cycle ability. Over 200 cycles it achieves with a high columbic efficiency around 95%.

Interconnected three-dimensional frameworks comprising multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene, or carbon particles offer a combination of constituent advantages and can thus be used to achieve superior energy conversion and storage properties. Herein, we designed and prepared free-standing three-dimensional sulfur papers containing interconnected highly conductive carbon materials, which enable to be flexible binder-free cathodes for Li-S batteries. The resultant sulfur-carbon composite paper cathode exhibited high reversible specific capacity of 1386 mAhg(-1), good rate capability up to 5C, and excellent cycling performance (a capacity retention 68% after 400 cycles), all of which are significantly improved from those of bare sulfur cathode or sulfur-GO composite only.

However, their relatively low conductivity and activity limit the LiPS conversion kinetics. Herein, the Co-doped MoS2 is proposed to accelerate the catalytic conversion of LiPS as the Co doping can promote the transition from semiconducting 2H phase to metallic 1T phase and introduce the sulfur vacancies in MoS2. A one-step hydrothermal process is used to prepare such a Co-doped MoS2 with more 1T phase and rich sulfur vacancies, which enhances the electron transfer and catalytic activity, thus effectively improving the LiPS adsorption and conversion kinetics. The cathode using the three-dimensional graphene monolith loaded with Co-doped MoS2 catalyst as the sulfur host shows a high rate capability and long cycling stability. A high capacity of 941 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and a low capacity fading of 0.029% per cycle at 1 C over 1000 cycles are achieved, suggesting the effectively suppressed LiPS shuttling and improved sulfur utilization. Good cyclic stability is also maintained under a high sulfur loading indicating the doping is an effective way to optimize the metal sulfide catalysts in Li-S batteries.

The C-WS2 separator reduces the shuttling effect and increases the cycle life of the battery because of the excellent adsorption capability of polar WS2 to polysulfides. Furthermore, conductive carbon substantially enhances the ionic conductivity of (1 X 10(-3) S cm(-1)). The cell with the C-WS2 separator delivers an excellent discharge capacity of 996 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and retained at 416 mA h g(-1) after runs over 1000 cycles with a 0.045% capacity decay per cycle.

However, Li-S batteries still suffer from severe capacity fading due to the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides. Here, we develop a freestanding double-layer MoO3/carbon nanotube@S (FMC@S) membrane by hydrothermal and suction filtration strategy, without polymer binder and current collector substrate. FMC@S contains a polysulfide blocking layer and an active material layer. Except for S content, the two layers have the same components and are integrated together, so there is no distinct interface between the two layers, which can facilitate ion and electron transport. As a result, the FMC@S cathode delivers promising capacity retention and rate capability. The hierarchical integrated design provides a new strategy to develop high-performance flexible cathodes for Li-S batteries.

In this paper, a three-dimensional mesoporous reduced graphene oxide-based nanocomposite, with the embedding of metallic Co nanoparticles and the doping of elemental N (Co/NrGO), and its simply ground mixture with powdered S at a mass ratio of 1:6 (Co/NrGO/S) are prepared and used as cathode-/separator-coated interlayers and working electrodes in assembled Li-S cells, respectively. One of the effective cell configurations is to paste composite Co/NrGO onto both the S-loading cathode and separator, showing good cycling stability (1070 mAh g(-1) in the 100th cycle at 0.2 C), high-rate capability (835 mAh g(-1), 2.0 C), and excellent durability (905 mAh g(-1) in the 250th cycle at 0.5 or 0.2 C). Compared with the experimental results of Co-absent NrGO, electrochemical properties of various Co/NrGO-based cell configurations clearly show multiple functions of Co/NrGO, indicating that the absence of Co/NrGO coatings and/or Co nanoparticles may be inadequate to achieve superior S availability of assembled Li-S batteries.

Herein, 3D hierarchical carbon with abundant pores is used for sulfur encapsulation (S@DHPC), which achieves a high sulfur content of 74 wt% and high sulfur loading of 5.8 mg cm(-2). Importantly, coating the obtained S@DHPC electrode with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) conducting polymers is found to effectively impede the diffusion of polysulfide species, leading to marked improvement of the cycling stability of the electrode; and the electrode performance increases with an increasing number of the S@DHPC/PEDOT:PSS layer. For a three-layer electrode, at a current density of 2 C, it delivers a discharge capacity of 846 mAh g(-1) in the first cycle and maintains a capacity of 716 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles, corresponding to a fading rate of only 0.033% cycle(-1). Results from this study suggest that layered electrodes can be exploited as a unique electrode architecture for the fabrication of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

The process involves the modification of MWCNTs via oxidation catalyzed by acid and the introduction of sulfur nanoparticles into the MWCNTs through direct precipitation. The resulting sample (precipitated S/MWCNTs) is characterized with scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis, and its performance as cathode of lithium/sulfur battery is investigated with a comparison of the sample prepared by ball-milling (ball-milling S/MWCNTs). It is found that the precipitated S/MWCNTs exhibit better battery performance than the ball-milling S/MWCNTs. The initial discharge capacity is 1,299 mA h g(-1) for the precipitated S/MWCNTs but only 839 mA h g(-1) for ball-milling S/MWCNTs at 0.02 C. The capacity remains 800 mA h g(-1) for the precipitated S/MWCNTs but only 620 mA h g(-1) for ball-milling S/MWCNTs at 0.05 C after 50 cycles. The better performance of the precipitated S/MWCNTs results from the improved uniformity of S dispersed in MWCNTs through precipitation.

Although attempts made toward electrode engineering have improved the existing drawbacks, nanoengineering is still hindered by some issues. To achieve practical applications of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, it is difficult to attain a high areal capacity with stable cycling. Physical encapsulation via nanostructural design not only can resolve the issue of lithium polysulfide dissolution during the electrochemical cycling, but also can offer significant contact resistance, which in turn can decrease the kinetics, particularly at a high sulfur loading. Thus, we demonstrate an electrospun carbon nanofiber (CNF) matrix for a sulfur cathode. This simple design enables a high mass loading of 10.5 mg cm(-2) with a high specific capacity and stable cycling. The CNF-sulfur complex can deliver a high areal capacity of greater than 7 mAh cm(-2), which is related to the excellent electrical conductivity of one-dimensional species. Moreover, we have observed that the reacted sulfur species have adhered well to the junction of the CNF network with specific wetting angles, which are induced by the cohesive force between the narrow gaps in the matrix that trapped the viscous polysulfides during cycling. The results of this study open new avenues for the design of high-areal-capacity Li-S batteries.

However, the traditional binders are no longer satisfactory in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries because of their failure in accommodating the large volume changes of sulfur and trapping soluble intermediate polysulfides, thus causing severe capacity decay. In this work, we prepared a multifunctional binder for Li-S batteries by merely modifying the acacia gum (AG), a low-cost biomass polymer, with L-cysteine under mild conditions. Owing to the introduced amino and carboxyl branches by the L-cysteine, the modified AG shows enhanced polysulfide trapping ability and can effectively restrain the shuttling of polysulfides. In addition, the introduction of branches can help form a cross-linked 3D network with better mechanical strength and flexibility for adhering sulfur and accommodating the volume changes of cathode materials. As a result, compared with the normally used polyvinylidene fluoride binder and the unmodified AG binder, the L-cysteine-modified AG binder effectively enhanced the rate capability and cycling stability of the Li-S batteries directly using sulfur as the cathode, showing a promising way to prompt the practical use of Li-S batteries.

The conventional rechargeable batteries with fixed geometries and sizes have limited their functionalities in wearable applications. The first-ever graphene-based fibrous rechargeable batteries are reported in this work. Ultralight composite fibers consisting of reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube filled with a large amount of sulfur (rGO/CNT/S) are prepared by a facile, one-pot wet-spinning method. The liquid crystalline behavior of high concentration GO sheets facilitates the alignment of rGO/CNT/S composites, enabling rational assembly into flexible and conductive fibers as lithium-sulfur battery electrodes. The ultralight fiber electrodes with scalable linear densities ranging from 0.028 to 0.13 mg cm(-1) deliver a high initial capacity of 1255 mAh g(-1) and an areal capacity of 2.49 mAh cm(-2) at C/20.

J	Yang, YF; Zhang, JP				Yang, Yanfei; Zhang, Junping			Highly Stable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Based on Laponite Nanosheet-Coated Celgard Separators	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						laponite nanosheets; lithium-sulfur batteries; polysulfides; polysulfide shuttle; separators	LI-S BATTERIES; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; SOLID-ELECTROLYTE; CARBON NANOTUBES; RATIONAL DESIGN; CYCLE LIFE; COMPOSITE; MEMBRANE	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are of great interest due to their high theoretical energy density. However, one of the key issues hindering their real world applications is polysulfide shuttle, which results in severe capacity decay and self-discharge. Here, a laponite nanosheets/carbon black coated Celgard (LNS/CB-Celgard) separator to inhibit polysulfide shuttle and to enhance the Li+ conductivity simultaneously is reported. The polysulfide shuttle is efficiently inhibited through strong interactions between the O active sites of the LNS and polysulfides by forming the Li...O and O-S bonds. Moreover, the separator features high Li+ conductivity, fast Li+ diffusion, excellent electrolyte wettability, and high thermal stability. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with the LNS/CB-Celgard separator and the pure S cathode show a high initial reversible capacity of 1387 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, high rate performance, superior cycling stability (with a capacity decay rate of 0.06% cycle(-1) at 0.2 C and 0.028% cycle(-1) at 1.0 C over 500 cycles), and ultralow self-discharge. The separator could also enhance the performance of other batteries such as the LiFePO4/separator/Li battery. This work sheds a new light on the design and preparation of novel separators for highly stable Li-S batteries via a "green" and cost-effective approach.

However, the practical implementation of Li-S batteries is seriously hampered by the notorious shuttling of polysulfides. Current research mostly focuses on modifying polyolefin-based separators for immobilization of polysulfides. Herein we report a facile and efficient approach for fabrication of a functional bilayer separator based on 0D (nanocrystals)/1D (nanofibers) composite mats. The top layer comprises CeO2 nanocrystals spatially besieged by carbon nanofibers, serving as electrocatalysts to accelerate the reduction of polysulfides, meanwhile, acting as a dual-conductive upper current collector and a polysulfide inhibitor. The support layer maintains the structural integrity of the separator and allows the safe operation of Li-S batteries at high temperature. Consequently, the Li-S batteries with the bilayer separators exhibit a high initial reversible capacity of 1359 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, high rate capability, superior cycling stability (with a capacity decay rate of 0.04% per cycle at 0.5 C over 300 cycles), and ultralow self-discharge.

One-step dual template technique is employed to prepare nitrogen doped polymer-silica nanocomposites with "interpenetration twins" nano-architectures at the initial stage. After carbonization and etching of silica, the "interpenetration twins" nano-architectures converted into interconnected functionalized mesoporous carbon nanospheres that endow desired micro-mesoporous volume (4.75 cm(3)/g) and high-specific area (SBET, 1875 m(2)/g). To the best of our knowledge, we achieved the highest sulfur content (90.4 wt%) in the carbon-based cathodes due to the interlinked pore network between S and carbon skeleton, which is formed by occupying the space of the removed silica with sulfur. In this way sulfur element could be closely contacted with the conductive carbon skeleton. Furthermore, polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) composite polymer were adhesive on the encapsulated carbon shell to limit the leakage of lithium sulfide leading to an improved the capacity retention of Li-S batteries. Noticeably, the average of the capacity decay reached to 0.023% per cycle during 3,100 cycles, which represent optimal performance of long-period lithium-sulfur batteries heretofore. The effortless method can provide a new way to design exceptionally high pore volume with interconnected mesoporous, and maintained definite hollow nanostructure, which are critical for porous carbons and energy storage.

The MWCNTs activated by potassium hydroxide (denoted as K-MWCNTs) were used as conductive additive. The as-prepared K-MWCNTs-S composites can display excellent cycle stability and rate capability with the initial discharge capacity of 741 mAh g-1 and capacity retention of 80% after 50 cycles compared to pure S. The improvement in the electrochemical performance for K-MWCNTs-S composites is attributed to the interstitial structure of the MWCNTs resulted from the strong chemical etching, which can facilitate the insertion and extraction of Li ions and more better percolation of the electrolyte, and also ascribed to enhanced electronic conductivity of K-MWCNTs-S composites. It is indicated that the K-MWCNTs-S composites can be used as the cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, a functional sulfur cathode using thiol-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTSH) is synthesized as the host material. Experimental and theoretical calculation results show that the thiol groups attached to carbon nanotubes can covalently bond with soluble sulfur species during cycling. Meanwhile, the conductive matrix of the carbon nanotubes provides a facile pathway for electron transport. The fabricated functional cathode material shows improved electrochemical performance. The discharge capacity still maintains 669.2 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles, accompanied with a low-capacity fading rate of 0.166% per cycle at 0.1 C, whereas the sulfur cathode material without thiol modification only exhibits 328.3 mAh g(-1) under the same conditions. This work indicates the significance of forming chemical bonds between sulfur species and host materials during the redox process and may provide a new way to design excellent Li-S batteries.

XRD spectra showed that the diffraction peak of graphite oxide (GO) at 10 degrees disappeared, while the relatively weak diffraction peak at 27 degrees belongs to graphene emerged. FT-IR spectra showed that the vibrations of the functional groups of GO, such as 3603 cm(-1), 1723 cm(-1) and 1619 cm(-1) which contributed from -OH, C-O-C and C=O respectively, disappeared when compared to the spectra of GSC. SEM observations indicated that the optimum experimental condition followed as: mass ratio of GO and S was 1: 1, 10% NaOH was used to adjust the pH. EDX analysis showed that the sulfur content reached at 68.8% of the composite material. The resultant electric resistance was nearly less than GO's resistance in three orders of magnitude under same condition. Further electrochemical performance tests showed a coulombic efficiency was 96% from the first cycle capacity was 827 mAh g(-1), to 388 mAh g(-1) in the 100 cycles. This study carries substantial significance to the development of Li-S battery cathode materials. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

As a result of charge/discharge test, sulfur cathode having carbon layer of 180 angstrom showed the highest capacity of 1178 mA hg(-1) at first discharge. Moreover, discharge capacity showed about 500 mA hg(-1) until 50th cycle, which is two times larger than that of no-coated sulfur cathode. This capacity increase could be considered due to the decrease of polysulfides dissolution and the enhancement of electrical contact by surface carbon layer. The changes of sulfur cathode during discharge process were investigated by SEM observation, XRD and DSC measurements. From these results, a discharge reaction mechanism of lithium/carbon-coated sulfur cell was suggested. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the inferior cycle stability of Li-S batteries, mainly caused by the polysulfides migration, constrains their practical application. Herein, a honeycomb-like N, P dualdoped carbon (HNPC) modified separator is adopted to restrain the shuttle effect. Particularly, the comparative experiments to systematically explore the reaction mechanisms between HNPC and polysulfides are performed. The results reveal that HNPC coated separator can effectively immobilize the polysulfides via forming strong N-Li(+ )and P-S bonds without sacrificing lithium ions diffusion. As results, the Li-S battery employing the HNPC coated separator exhibits the high initial specific capacity of 1387 mA h g(-1) and can retain good capacity of 930 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C, as well as outstanding long-term cycle durability even at high current density of 1.0C with only 0.06% capacity attenuation per cycle for over 900 cycles. Moreover, stable and high areal capacity (> 3 mA h cm(-2)) is also achieved under high sulfur areal loading conditions (4 mg cm(-2)).

The effects of S incorporation on microstructure, surface area, pore size distribution, and pore volume of the S/CA hybrids are studied. The electrochemical performance of the S/CA hybrids is investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatical charge-discharge, and cyclic voltammetry techniques. The 3D porous S/CA hybrids exhibit significantly improved reversible capacity, high-rate capability, and excellent cycling performance as a cathode electrode for Li-S batteries. The S/CA hybrid with an optimal incorporating content of 27% S shows an excellent reversible capacity of 820 mAhg(-1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mAg(-1). Even at a current density of 3.2C (5280 mAg(-1)), the reversible capacity of 27%S/CA hybrid can still maintain at 521 mAhg(-1) after 50 cycles. This strategy for the S/CA hybrids as cathode materials to utilize the abundant micropores for sulfur immobilizers for sulfur impregnation for Li-S battery offers a new way to solve the long-term reversibility obstacle and provides guidelines for designing cathode electrode architectures.

The enhanced electrochemical performance is ascribed to the rational combination of nanopores and N-doping, which provide efficient contact and wetting with the electrolyte, accommodate volume expansion and immobilize polysulfides during cycling.

To address these problems, we synthesize sandwich-like composites which consist of ultrafine nanosulfur particles enveloped by little oxygen-functionalized graphene layers (F-GS@S). In this structure, the little oxygen-functionalized graphene backbone can not only accelerate the redox kinetics of sulfur species, but also eliminate the shuttle effect of polysulfides by strong chemical interaction. Moreover, the sandwich confinement structures can further inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides by physical restraint and accommodate the volume contraction/expansion of sulfur during cycling. As a result, the F-GS@S composites used as cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries display a superior rate capability with the high capacities of 1208 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 601.7 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and high cycling stability with a capacity retention of 70.5% after 500 cycles at 2 C. In situ characterizations and real-time monitoring experiments during the charge-discharge process are carried out to elucidate the reaction mechanism of the F-GS@S composites as cathodes for high rate and long-life lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, their practical application is hindered by poor cycling performance and rate capability. In this study, we prepared a multifunctional interlayer composed of SnO2 nanowires (NWs) and conductive carbon paper (CP) to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. This SnO2 NWs@CP interlayer could efficiently adsorb lithium polysulfides and provide electron-conductive pathways to the sulfur electrode, leading to suppression of the polysulfide shuttle effect and enhancement of the electrochemical reaction kinetics for cycling performance and rate capability. A lithium-sulfur cell fabricated with SnO2 NWs@CP interlayer at a high sulfur loading amount (ca. 4.0 mg cm(-2)) could deliver a high specific capacity of 815 mAh g(-1) (based on sulfur) even after 100 cycles at 0.2 degrees C with a high coulombic efficiency of 98.2%. These results demonstrate that the introduction of multifunctional SnO2 NWs@CP interlayers should be a promising new strategy for the development of high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

A new graphitic carbon nitride-coated dual Core-Shell sulfur cathode for highly stable lithium-sulfur cells	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Graphitic carbon nitride; Lithium polysulfides; Polysulfide shuttle effect; Dual core-shell structure	NITROGEN-DOPED CARBON; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE-OXIDE; LONG-LIFE; BATTERIES; POLYSULFIDE; COMPOSITE; HOST; NANOPARTICLES; FRAMEWORK	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have promise to deliver energy density two to three times higher than that of currently used lithium-ion batteries. The commercialization of Li-S batteries is primarily hindered due to the polysulfide shuttle (PSS) effect, which not only leads to the loss of active materials from the cathode, but also causes serious irreversible reactions between the polysulfide intermediates and the lithium metal anode, resulting in low coulombic efficiency, high self-discharge and short cycle life. In this paper, we report the design and synthesis of a new graphitic carbon nitride-coated dual core-shell structured sulfur cathode (S@HCS@g-C3N4) to address these issues, leading to superior capacity retention properties in Li-S cells. This structural design allows confinement of polysulfide intermediates within a dual-core electrically conductive structure consisting of a hollow mesoporous carbon sphere (HCS) core, and a peripheral graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) layer, which is known to suppress the PSS effect by enhanced chemical interactions with polysulfide intermediates. Indeed, the S@HCS@g-C3N4 cathode displayed excellent electrochemical performance in terms of high initial specific capacity (1446 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C) and very good long-term cycling performance (capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1C).

To conquer both the two problems simultaneously, herein, an effective sulfur host has been demonstrated through implanting vanadium nitride (VN) nanoparticles homogeneously into nitrogen doped 3D interconnected-pore graphene (VN/N-rGO) hybrid architecture. The VN nanoparticles derived from the cracking and transformation of V2O5 nanowire have an average size below 20 nm not only provide abundant adsorption sites for trapping sulfur species but facilitate accelerate the conversion reaction between Li2S6 and Li2S2/Li2S by a catalytic effect. In addition, the interconnected highly conductive frameworks of N-rGO with abundant hierarchical pore structure enable fast electron/ion transportation and sufficient accommodation to absorb/entrap polysulfides. Own to these synergistic advantages, the designed VN/N-rGO based sulfur cathodes with high sulfur loadings (7.3 mg cm(-2)) manifests a high initial capacity of 698 mAh g(-1) and retains 78% capacity after 200cycles at 1.0 C, providing novel insights for high-energy-density and stable Li/S batteries.

K-NGC/S composite has been prepared by mixing S with K-NGC via melt-diffusion method where NGC has been activated by potassium hydroxide (denoted as K-NGC) and is used as a conductive additive. The as-prepared K-NGC/S composite shows good specific discharge capacity and rate capability with an initial specific discharge capacity of 1121.9 mAh g(-1) and a specific discharge capacity of 729.7 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 335 mA g(-1), which is better than pure S. This improvement in the specific discharge capacity and the rate capability of the cell with K-NGC/S composite as a cathode material is realized by the existence of K-NGC, which can offers a superb conductive environment for S, effectively encapsulate S, restrain the outward diffusion of polysulfides, buffer volume change upon cycling and reduce the dissolution of lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte. The good electrochemical performance of K-NGC/S composite would make it become a promising cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This can be achieved by developing facile methods for the synthesis of novel nanostructured carbon materials that can function as effective cathode hosts. In this Article, we report the scalable synthesis of ordered mesoporous carbon nanosheets (OMCNS) via the etching of self-assembled iron oxide/carbon hybrid nanosheets (IO-C NS), which serve as an advanced sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The obtained two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets have close-packed uniform cubic mesopores of similar to 20 nm side length, and the gap between the pores is similar to 4 nm, which resembles the honeycomb structure consisting of an ordered array of hexagonal pores. We loaded OMCNS with sulfur by a simple melting infusion process and evaluated the performance of the resulting OMCNS-sulfur composites as the cathode material. As a result, the sulfur-loaded OMCNS hybrid (OMCNS-S) electrode infiltrated with 70 wt % sulfur delivers a high and stable reversible capacity of 505.7 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 C-rate with excellent capacity retention (a decay of 0.081% per cycle) and excellent rate capability (580.6 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 2 C). The improved electrochemical properties could be attributed to the fact that the uniform cubic mesopores offer sufficient space for the volume expansion of sulfur inside them and therefore trap the polysulfides during the charging discharging process. Therefore, these unique structured carbon nanosheets can be promising candidates for other energy-storage applications.

Herein, a MoS2/mesoporous carbon hollow sphere (MoS2/MCHS) structure has been proposed as an efficient sulfur cathode via a simple wet impregnation method and gas phase vulcanization method. Multi-fold structural merits have been demonstrated for the MoS2/MCHS structures. On one hand, the mesoporous carbon hollow sphere (MCHS) matrix, with abundant pore structures and high specific surface areas, could load a large amount of sulfur, improve the electronical conductivity of sulfur electrodes, and suppress the volume changes during the repeated sulfur conversion processes. On the other hand, ultrathin multi-layer MoS2 nanosheets are revealed to be uniformly distributed in the mesoporous carbon hollow spheres, enhancing the physical adsorption and chemical entrapment functionalities towards the soluble polysulfide species. Having benefited from these structural advantages, the sulfur-impregnated MoS2/MCHS cathode presents remarkably improved electrochemical performances in terms of lower voltage polarization, higher reversible capacity (1094.3 mAh g(-1)), higher rate capability (590.2 mAh g(-1) at 2 C), and better cycling stability (556 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at 2 C) compared to the sulfur-impregnated MCHS cathode. This work offers a novel delicate design strategy for functional materials to achieve high performance lithium sulfur batteries.

In this study, nitrogen-doped three-dimensional porous carbon material loaded with CoSe2 nanoparticles (CoSe2-PNC) is developed as a cathode for lithium-sulfur battery. A combination of CoSe2 and nitrogen-doped porous carbon can efficiently improve the cathode activity and its conductivity, resulting in enhanced redox kinetics of the charge/discharge process. The obtained electrode exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of 1139.6 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 C. After 100 cycles, its capacity remained at 865.7 mAh g(-1) thus corresponding to a capacity retention of 75.97 %. In a long-term cycling test, discharge specific capacity of 546.7 mAh g(-1) was observed after 300 cycles performed at a current density of 1 C.

Still plagued by a familiar problem, owing to the sluggish kinetics of irreversible Li2S2/Li2S species deposition, lithium-sulfur batteries with high theoretical energy are far from being realized. Inspired by the similarity between oxygen and sulfur, being in the same group, commercially available Pt/C was investigated here to explore the possible effect on the sulfur cathode. The electrochemical tests show that the electrode with 2wt% Pt added delivers a 61% enhancement in the discharging specific capacity compared to the control electrode after 200 cycles at 0.5C, along with an average coulombic efficiency of 98.3%. It is proven that these beneficial results can be attributed to the favorable capability of polysulfide immobilization and effective inhibition of self-discharging behavior. The ex situ XPS analysis and the increased exchange current density further reveal that the involved platinum nanoparticles could not only function as a static chemical absorber for polysulfide species, but, more importantly, to promote the redox kinetic effectively as an electrochemical catalyst. The positive effect of utilizing commercial Pt/C materials directly on sulfur cathodes is of great significance in developing sulfur cathodes for Li/S batteries.

Numerous bi-functional interlayers have been used for enhancing the cycle life of Li-S batteries based on novel cell configuration. Most interlayers, however, are conductive carbon materials, which that have weak interactions with polysulfides, and this resulting in fast capacity losing over long-term cycling. Herein, for the first time, carbon@Ti4O7 composite nanofibers (C@Ti4O7 CNFs) have been successfully synthesized using in situ synthetic method. The C@Ti4O7 CNFs interlayer cells have excellent electrochemical performances due to the good restriction of diffused polysulfide, the uniform distribution of final discharge products (sulfides) and the improved conductivity of the whole cathode in charge/discharge process. An initial capacity of 1046 mAh g(-1) at 2 C is achieved, with a fade rate of only 0.09% per cycle over 500 cycles, and it finally keeps a capacity of 560 mAh g(-1). Even with a high rate of 4 C, the cells still exhibited a favorable specific capacity of 860 mAh g(-1) after 25 cycles, and it returns back to a high specific capacity more than 1000 mAh g(-1) when the rate is reduced to 0.5 C, and this showing indicated good reversibility.

The interlayer has a double cross-linked structure formed by ZIF-7 nanosheets MOF and PCF fibers (ZIF-7@PCF). The PCF was obtained by heat treatment of polymer fibers prepared by electro-spinning technique. The PCF possesses a conducive porous carbonaceous skeleton, which can promote the electron and ion transportation in the cell. Meanwhile, the ZIF-7 MOF offers abundant active sites for LiPS trapping and conversion reaction. This unique double cross-linked structure design endows the ZIF-7@PCF interlayer with excellent performance in mitigating LiPS shuttling in the cell. As a result, the Li-S battery with the ZIF-7@PCF interlayer delivers an initial discharge specific capacity of 1221 mAh g(-1) at of 0.2C and a good rate performance with a specific capacity of 661.3 mAh g(-1) at 5C. Even under long-term cycling test at 1C, a benign cycling performance can be achieved with a discharge specific capacity of 812 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles, corresponding to a capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle.

In this composite, ultrathin S layers are uniformly deposited on graphene nanosheets and covered by a thin layer of amorphous carbon derived from beta-cyclodextrin on the surface. Such a unique microstructure, not only improves the electrical conductivity of sulfur, but also effectively inhibits the dissolution of polysulfides during charging/discharging processes. As a result, this ternary nanocomposite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. It can deliver a high initial discharge and charge capacity of 1410 mAh.g(-1) and 1370 mAh.g(-1), respectively, and a capacity retention of 63.8% can be achieved after 100 cycles at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA.g(-1)). A relatively high specific capacity of 450 mAh.g(-1) can still be retained after 200 cycles at a high rate of 2 C.

However, the insulating nature and the soluble reaction intermediate products still hinder its large-scale industry and acceptance by the market. Tremendous efforts focus on the composite of polar material and non-polar material to solve the weaknesses of material insulating nature and soluble reaction intermediate products. However, the linkage form between these two generic materials has been ignored. In this paper, by using typical Ni2P as polar material and graphene as non-polar material, the reaction kinetics changes and its intrinsic theories on behavior enhancement have been proved, which construct different binding type between polar and non-polar materials. The Ni2P/PrGO delivers an improved high specific capacity of 1254.6 mAh g(-1) than Ni2P/rGO at 0.2 C. The relevant X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy result and the in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests prove that the linkage state between polar and non-polar material has strong influence on the sulfur cathode reaction kinetics. The enhanced reaction kinetics and polar adsorption behavior bring the soft pack battery testing unit over 150 stable cycles with decay ratio of 0.19% for each cycle.

However, the practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is seriously impeded by the notorious shuttling of soluble polysulfide intermediates, inducing a low utilization of active materials, severe self-discharge, and thus a poor cycling life, which is particularly severe in high-sulfur-loading cathodes. Herein, a polysulfide-immobilizing polymer is reported to address the shuttling issues. A natural polymer of Gum Arabic (GA) with precise oxygen-containing functional groups that can induce a strong binding interaction toward lithium polysulfides is deposited onto a conductive support of a carbon nanofiber (CNF) film as a polysulfide shielding interlayer. The as-obtained CNF-GA composite interlayer can achieve an outstanding performance of a high specific capacity of 880 mA h g(-1) and a maintained specific capacity of 827 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles under a sulfur loading of 1.1 mg cm(-2). More importantly, high reversible areal capacities of 4.77 and 10.8 mA h cm(-2) can be obtained at high sulfur loadings of 6 and even 12 mg cm(-2), respectively. The results offer a facile and promising approach to develop viable lithium-sulfur batteries with high sulfur loading and high reversible capacities.

Metallically conductive TiB2 as a multi-functional separator modifier for improved lithium sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						TiB2; High conductivity; Multi-functional separator; Lithium sulfur battery	HIGH-ENERGY-DENSITY; POLYSULFIDE SOLUBILITY; MACROPOROUS-CARBON; PERFORMANCE; INTERLAYER; DIFFUSION; FILM	A metallically conductive TiB2 is developed to construct multifunctional separator toward improved lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery performance. Coupled with two-dimensional graphene, the obtained TiB2@G separator fulfills a synergistic combination of strong physical and chemical sulfur immobilization as well as a high-efficiency sulfur reutilization, thus establishing a robust barrier against the polysulfide shuttling and enabling a fast and durable sulfur electrochemistry. As a result, cells based on TiB2@G separator exhibit a high sulfur utilization with 1350 mA h g(-1) capacity at 0.05C, superb rate capability up to 5.0C, and excellent cyclability with a high capacity retention over 85% after 300 cycles at 0.5C. Moreover, significantly mitigated self-discharge and considerably high areal capacity of 5.8 mA h cm(-2) can be also achieved, indicating the great promise of this separator design for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, we developed composite cathodes consisting of polycarboxylate functionalized graphene (PC-FGF) doped with TiO2 nanoparticles or poly1,5-diaminoanthraquinone (PDAAQ) and sulfur to enhance chemisorption property toward polysulfides. Additionally, PC-FGF/sulfur composite cathode functions as an efficient trapping site for polysulfides spices as well as contributes to facilitate electron and Li-ions movement toward or from the cathode. In the first experiment, the cell with sulfur incorporated TiO2/PC-FGF cathode is assembled with three different cathode-facing side-coated glass fiber separators. At the second test, PDAAQ/PC-FGF cathode is assembled with the same separator materials as before. The best electrochemical performance observed was sulfur incorporated TiO2/PC-FGF cathode with PDAAQ/PC-FGF-coated separator having a high discharge capacity of 1100 mAh g(- 1) at 0.5 C after 100 cycles. It is found that the combination of TiO2/PC-FGF/sulfur cathode and PDAAQ/PC-FCF separator could serve as promising cathode and separator material due to high cycling stability and rate capability for advanced Li-S batteries.

Unfortunately, it still suffers from poor cycling life and low coulombic efficiency caused by the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides. Herein, we designed a nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon host (NHPC) for physical and chemical confinement of polysulfides to effectively reduce the shuttling effect. This NHPC was prepared by a simple one-step pyrolysis process using low-cost ascorbic acid as the carbon source, melamine as the nitrogen source and Zn(NO3)(2) as the pore generating and carbon exfoliation agent. The resulted NHPC was found to possess randomly stacked ultrathin holy carbon sheets, high BET surface area and pore volume, rich micro- and meso-pores and enriched nitrogen doping. When infiltrated with sulfur, the resulted NHPC/S material was found to exhibit excellent electrochemical cycling performance. It delivered a high initial capacity of 1200 mAh/g at 0.2C, a reversible capacity of 729 mAh/g after 300 cycles at 1.0C and excellent cycling stability with a capacity decay of only 0.057% per cycle after 300 cycles at 1.0C. This work demonstrated a facile and efficient route to synthesize nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon host for immobilization of sulfur in Li-S battery technology.

It is demonstrated from a series of measurements that the nafion layer is quite effective in reducing shuttle effect and enhancing the stability and the reversibility of the electrode. When measured under the rate of 0.2 C, the initial discharge capacity of the nafion coated electrode can reach 1084 mAh g(-1), with a Columbic efficiency of about 100%. After 100 charge/discharge cycles, this electrode can also deliver a reversible capacity of as high as 879 mAh g(-1). Significantly, the charge-transfer resistance of the electrode tends to be reducing after coated with an appropriate thickness of nafion film. The cation conductivity as well as anion inconductivity is considered to be the dominant factor for the superior electrochemical properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the commercialization of Li-S batteries has been blocked by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide intermediates, the insulating nature of sulfur, and the volume expansion during cycling. Here, hierarchical porous N,O dual-doped carbon microrods (NOCMs) were developed as sulfur host materials with a large pore volume (1.5 cm(3) g(-1)) and a high surface area (1147 m(2) g(-1)). The highly porous structure of the NOCMs can act as a physical barrier to lithium polysulfides, while N and O functional groups enhance the interfacial interaction to trap lithium polysulfides, permitting a high loading amount of sulfur (79-90 wt % in the composite). Benefiting from the physical and chemical anchoring effect to prevent shuttling of polysulfides, S@NOCMs composites successfully solve the problems of low sulfur utilization and fast capacity fade and exhibit a stable reversible capacity of 1071 mA h g(-1) after 160 cycles with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency at 0.2 C. The N,O dual doping treatment to porous carbon microrods paves a way toward rational design of high-performance Li-S cathodes with high energy density.

However, the sluggish redox kinetics and shuttling effect severely restrict the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, vanadium oxide nanorods were embedded in porous graphene aerogel (GA-VOx) as a dual-functional separator for the inhibition of shuttle effect and enhancement of conversion kinetic. The embedded VOx nanorods not only can chemisorb the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) but also catalyze the LiPSs into short chain Li2S. Based on these merits, the cell with GA-VOx/CB functional separator exhibits good cycling performance (708 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C) and high rate performance (442 mAh g(-1) at 2 C) than that of CB functional separator. Additionally, even with a high sulfur loading of 2.6 mg cm(-2), the cell still delivers a stable specific capacity of 630 mAh g(-1) after 140 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides a new route for practical application of Li-S batteries.

Density functional theory calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the hydroxyl groups in the CNTOH provoked strong interaction with lithium polysulfides and resulted in effective trapping of lithium polysulfides within the sulfur cathode side. The reduction in migration of lithium polysulfides to the lithium anode resulted in enhanced stability of the lithium electrode. The conductive nature of CNTOH also aided to efficiently reutilize the adsorbed reaction intermediates for subsequent cycling. As a result, the lithium-sulfur cell assembled with a functional separator exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1056 mAh g(-1) (corresponding to an areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm(-2)) with a capacity fading rate of 0.11% per cycle over 400 cycles at 0.5 C rate.

However, their market penetration is seriously impeded by great challenges such as the low electrical conduction of sulfur and lithium sulfides, and lithium polysulfides' shuttling effect. This work shows that such challenges can be partly resolved by encapsulating sulfur in crumpled reduced graphene oxide (S@crGO), which was synthesized by a facile and scalable one-step in situ method. The strong interaction between sulfur and the graphene host, micro- and meso-pore structures, and rich surface functional groups contribute to the high performance of the S@crGO cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the dissolution of polysulfides in liquid electrolytes causes the shuttle effect, and the rapid decay of lithium sulfur battery has greatly hindered its practical application. Herein, combination of sulfonated reduced graphene oxide (SRGO) interlayer on the separator is adopted to suppress the shuttle effect. We speculate that this SRGO layer plays two roles: physically blocking the migration of polysulfide as ion selective layer and anchoring lithium polysulfide by the electronegative sulfonic group. Lewis acid base theory and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that sulfonic groups have a strong tendency to interact with lithium ions in the lithium polysulfide. Hence, the synergic effect involved by the sulfonic group contributes to the enhancement of the battery performance. Furthermore, the uniformly distributed sulfonic groups working as active sites which could induce the uniform distribution of sulfur, alleviating the excessive growth of sulfur and enhancing the "utilization of active sulfur. With this interlayer, the prototype battery exhibits a high reversible discharge capacity of more-than 1300 mAh g(-1) and good capacity retention of 802 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.5 C rate. After 60 cycles at different rates from 0.2 to 4 C, the cell with this functional separator still recovered a high specific capacity of 1100 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. The results demonstrate a promising interlayer design toward high, performance lithium sulfur battery with longer cycling life, high specific capacity, and rate capability.

However, the capacity decay caused by polysulfide shuttle leading to sluggish kinetics of polysulfide redox reactions is the main hindrance for its practical application in Li-S batteries. Herein, molybdenum carbide nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanotubes (Mo2C/CNT) are reported to serve as an efficient cathode material to enhance the electrochemical kinetics of polysulfide conversion in Li-S batteries. Mo2C/CNT shows strong adsorption and activation of polar polysulfides and therefore accelerates the redox kinetics of polysulfides, reduces the energy barrier, effectively mitigates the polarization and polysulfide shuttle, thus improving the electrochemical performance. The S-Mo2C/CNT composite with 70 wt% sulfur loading exhibits high specific discharge capacity (1206 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C), excellent high-rate performance, long cycle life (900 cycles), and outstanding Coulombic efficiency (similar to 100%) at a high rate (2C) corresponding to a capacity decay of only 0.05%. Remarkably, the S-Mo2C/CNT cathode with high areal sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2) exhibits high-rate capacities and stable cycling performance over 100 cycles, offering the potential for use in high energy Li-S batteries.

Unraveling the Operation Mechanisms of Lithium Sulfur Batteries with Ultramicroporous Carbons	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						energy storage; Li-S battery; ultramicroporous carbon; quasi-solid-state reaction; mechanism; modeling	SOLID-STATE LITHIATION; MICROPOROUS CARBON; MOLECULES; ELECTROLYTES; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE	Quasi-solid-state lithium sulfur batteries (QSS-LSBs) constitute a new type of lithium sulfur batteries having a cathode usually based on ultramicroporous carbon and presenting only one voltage plateau in their discharge profile. As the discharge of QSS-LSBs does not involve polysulfide dissolution, shuttle effects can be suppressed in this system. Here, we report a kinetic model to simulate the discharge process of QSS-LSB based on a two-step reaction mechanism. The simulation results well reproduce the one-plateau discharge profile and reveal that the high Li+ transport resistivity of Li2S and Li2S2 is the key capacity-limiting factor.

In this paper, cells with a high sulfur loading, 4.3 mg cm(-2), demonstrate excellent performances with the assistance of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) modified on the separator, and the density of modified layer is only 0.1 mg cm(-2), which is hardly any effect on energy density. Moreover, in order to understand the improvement mechanism of the modified layer, graphene oxide (GO) modified layer is also to be applied for comparison, which is also helpful to establish cognition to select other modification layers. Most important of all, the application of high sulfur loading is generally required for practical Li-S batteries and the extremely light-weight modified layer is beneficial to the exertion of the whole energy density.

Four-Dimensional Studies of Morphology Evolution in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						lithium sulfur; X-ray tomography; batteries; porous media; in situ characterization; synchrotron radiation	X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; LI-S BATTERIES; IN-SITU; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODES; CATHODE; VISUALIZATION; TOMOGRAPHY; MICROSCOPY; MECHANISM	Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries have great potential as a successor to Li-ion batteries, but their commercialization has been complicated by a multitude of issues stemming from their complex multiphase chemistry. In situ X-ray tomography investigations enable direct observations to be made about a battery, providing unprecedented insight into the microstructural evolution of the sulfur cathode and shedding light on the reaction kinetics of the sulfur phase. Here, for the first time, the morphology of a sulfur cathode was visualized in 3D as a function of state of charge at high temporal and spatial resolution. While elemental sulfur was originally well-dispersed throughout the uncycled cathode, subsequent charging resulted in the formation of sulfur clusters along preferred orthogonal orientations in the cathode. The electrical conductivity of the cathode was found not to be rate-limiting, suggesting the need to optimize the loading of conductive carbon additives. The carbon and binder domain and surrounding bulk pore phase were visualized in the in situ cell, and contrast changes within both phases were successfully extracted. The applications of this technique are not limited to microstructural and morphological characterization, and the volumetric data can serve as a valuable input for true 3D computational modeling of Li-S batteries.

Here, the polyethylene glycol@MoO3/carbon nanotubes/S composite (PEG@MoO3/CNTs/S)is prepared in this paper. PEG can trap polysulfides and suppress the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the polar MoO3 can effectively limit the transfer of polysulfides by chemisorption. Furthermore, the CNTs with the excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical properties is used as the substrate in lithium-sulfur batteries. The 2.5-PEG@MoO3/CNTs/S (2.5 refers to percentage of PEG coated) cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity (1327.4 mAh g-1 at 0.1C), an outstanding cycling stability (capacity fading rate of 0.067% per cycle at 0.5C over 800 cycles) and an excellent rate performance (899.1 mAh g-1 at 1C).

However, there remains a critical challenge in the manufacturing of mechanically robust, highly conductive and industrially processable fibrous cathodes. Here, a new and general strategy is proposed to produce freestanding sulfur-containing fibrous electrodes using industrially weavable stainless steel fibers (SSFs) as supports and current collectors. The SSFs based electrodes not only enable the feasibility of continuous processing and large-scale production, but also feature a porous fibrous structure that allows the imbibition of graphene-sulfur composite by facile capillary action. The wire-shaped lithium sulfur battery fabricated by this hybrid fibrous cathode shows mechanical robustness, high flexibility and excellent electrochemical performances. It can reach a capacity of 335 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 167.5 (0.1 C) mA g(-1), keep high stability after running for 100 cycles and realize a series of sophisticated applications for the flexible and wearable electronics.

Lithium-sulfur batteries with a very high energy density are a promising candidate for high-energy-density flexible power source. Here, we report flexible lithium-sulfur full cells consisting of ultrastable lithium cloth anodes, polysulfone-functionalized separators, and free-standing sulfur/graphene/boron nitride nanosheet cathodes. The carbon cloth decorated with lithiophilic three-dimensional MnO2 nanosheets not only provides the lithium anodes with an excellent flexibility but also limits the growth of the lithium dendrites during cycling, as revealed by theoretical calculations. Commercial separators are functionalized with polysulfone (PSU) via a phase inversion strategy, resulting in an improved thermal stability and smaller pore size. Due to the synergistic effect of the PSU-functionalized separators and boron nitride-graphene interlayers, the shuttle of the polysulfides is significantly inhibited. Because of successful control of the shuttle effect and dendrite formation, the flexible lithium-sulfur full cells exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility and outstanding electrochemical performance, which shows a superlong lifetime of 800 cycles in the folded state and a high areal capacity of 5.13 mAh cm(-2). We envision that the flexible strategy presented herein holds promise as a versatile and scalable platform for large-scale development of high-performance flexible batteries.

Benefiting from their unique and tunable structure, good conductivity and chemical inertness, hollow porous carbon materials has been considered as a promising candidate. Herein, precisely designed waxberry-like hierarchical hollow carbon spheres (h-CNS) have been synthesized as the sulfur micro-containers for lithium sulfur batteries. The prepared h-CNS/S electrode shows a good rate capability of 1311 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 962 mAh g(-1) at 1 C. In addition, the h-CNS/S electrode also shows satisfactory long cycle performance with 622 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and 400 mAh g(-1) at 4 C over 600 cycles. The desirable performance can be attributed to the wedge-shape micro-containers which improve the high dispersion of sulfur inside the channels and inhibit the loss of intermediate polysulfide. Moreover, the unique structure can also enhance the transfer of both lithium ions and electrons which benefits to the rate capability of the lithium sulfur batteries.

However, the disturbing shuttle effect, poor conductivity as well as large volume change of the electrode in the cycling process have seriously hindered the practical application. A porous-activated carbon derived from pomelo peel is thus developed with high specific surface area (2326.4 m(2) g(-1)) and abundant N and O heteroatoms to function as host of the S cathode. This porous carbon host originated from the renewable biomass of pomelo peel demonstrates remarkable advantages including higher sulfur accommodation (90% of S in C/S composite), improved conversion kinetics, and suppressed shuttle effect, which endows excellent electrochemical performances. Consequently, the prepared composite with 91.51% sulfur content delivers a high specific discharge capacity of 662.2 mAh g(-1) at 1 C as well as a low capacity decay rate of 0.068% per cycle.

This can be suppressed effectively by modifying the separator. Herein, a double-layered separator composed of a macroporous polypropylene (PP) matrix layer and an arrayed poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microsphere retarding layer is designed as the separator for lithium-sulfur batteries. A sulfur positive electrode with the PP/PMMA separator exhibits a high initial capacity of 1100.10 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2) along with a high Coulombic efficiency, which is higher than the corresponding first discharge capacity results obtained using the standard PP separator (948.60 mAh g(-1))In the double-layered separator, the arrayed PMMA microspheres can inhibit the diffusion of polysulfides through physical and chemical adsorption, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. In addition, the PMMA microspheres enhance the affinity of the separator to the electrolyte, which will increase the adsorption of the electrolyte to the separator and accelerate the diffusion rate of lithium ions.

Herein, a mesoporous carbon (MC-1000) material, with high specific surface area (1432 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume (2.894 cm(3) g(-1)), is prepared via situ template method (using MgO as template), followed by pyrolysis at 1000 degrees C in nitrogen atmosphere. Temperature-programmed route is used to regulate the pore wall of MC-1000, and the modified MC-1000, MC-1300 and MC-1600 with similar specific surface area and pore volume are chosen for investigating the effect of micro-structure of MC on the performance of Li/S battery. HR-TEM images show graphited structure gradually formed with the regulated progress, and the increasing of pyrolyzation temperature may also improve the conductivity of MC and MC/S composites. With an appropriate sulfur loading, MC-1300 and MC-1600 both present superior discharge capacity. Notably, MC-1300 and MC-1600 display high capacity of 1524 mAh g(-1) and 1415 mAh g(-1), respectively, which is close to the theoretical specific capacity of sulfur.

However, most of nitrogen heteroatoms are doped into the bulk phase of carbon without site selectivity, which significantly reduces the contacts of feedstocks with the active dopants in a conductive scaffold. Herein we proposed the chemical vapor deposition of a nitrogen-doped graphene skin on the 3D porous graphene framework and donated the carbon/carbon composite as surface N-doped grapheme (SNG). In contrast with routine N-doped graphene framework (NGF) with bulk distribution of N heteroatoms, the SNG renders a high surface N content of 1.81 at%, enhanced electrical conductivity of 31 S cm(-1), a large surface area of 1531 m 2 g(-1), a low defect density with a low I-D/I-G ratio of 1.55 calculated from Raman spectrum, and a high oxidation peak of 532.7 degrees C in oxygen atmosphere. The selective distribution of N heteroatoms on the surface of SNG affords the effective exposure of active sites at the interfaces of the electrode/electrolyte, so that more N heteroatoms are able to contact with oxygen feedstocks in oxygen reduction reaction or serve as polysulfide anchoring sites to retard the shuttle of polysulfides in a lithium-sulfur battery. This work opens a fresh viewpoint on the manipulation of active site distribution in a conductive scaffolds for multi-electron redox reaction based energy conversion and storage.

The main problems plaguing Li-S batteries are poor cycle life and limited rate capability, caused by the insulating nature of S and the shuttle effect associated with the dissolution of intermediate lithium polysulfides. Here, we report the use of biocell-inspired polydopamine (PD) as a coating agent on both the cathode and separator to address these problems (the "systematic effects"). The PD-modified cathode and separator play key roles in facilitating ion diffusion and keeping the cathode structure stable, leading to uniform lithium deposition and a solid electrolyte interphase. As a result, an ultralong cycle performance of more than 3000 cycles, with a capacity fade of only 0.018% per cycle, was achieved at 2 C. It is believed that the systematic modification of the cathode and separator for Li-S batteries is a new strategy for practical applications.

Abundant mesopores are introduced to superaligned carbon nanotubes (SACNTs) through controlled oxidation in air to obtain porous carbon nanotubes (PCNTs). Compared to original SACNTs, improved dispersive behavior, enhanced conductivity, and higher mechanical strength are demonstrated in PCNTs. Meanwhile, high flexibility and sufficient intertube interaction are preserved in PCNTs to support binder-free and flexible electrodes. Additionally, several attractive features, including high surface area and abundant adsorption points on tubes, are introduced, which allow high sulfur loading, provide dual protection to sulfur cathode materials, and consequently alleviate the capacity fade especially during slow charge/discharge processes. When used as cathodes for Li-S batteries, a high sulfur loading of 60 wt % is achieved, with excellent reversible capacities of 866 and 526 mAh g(-1) based on the weights of sulfur and electrode, respectively, after 100 cycles at a slow charge/discharge rate of 0.1C, revealing efficient suppression of polysulfide dissolution. Even with a high sulfur loading of 70 wt %, the S-PCNT composite maintains capacities of 760 and 528 mAh g(-1) based on the weights of sulfur and electrode, respectively, after 100 cycles at 0.1C, outperforming the current state-of-the-art sulfur cathodes. Improved high-rate capability is also delivered by the S-PCNT composites, revealing their potentials as high-performance carbon sulfur composite cathodes for Li-S batteries.

The resulting material shows a large total pore volume of 0.63 cm(3)g(-1) and thus acts as an ideal host for elemental sulfur. Melt impregnation was used to synthesize a carbon-sulfur composite (50:50 wt%) as a cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries. Characterization by electron microscopy clearly showed that the sulfur is homogeneously distributed within the carbon particles. Electrodes prepared from the composite show good cyclic stability at higher specific currents (e.g., at 500 mAg(-1)); capacities (related to the active material content) as high as 241 mAhg(-1) were retained after 100 cycles and coulombic efficiencies quickly reached values close to 100%. The material was also tested as an anode in sodium-ion batteries. Compared to the SiOC precursor, the carbon shows significantly improved electrochemical performance. For instance, at a specific current of 100 mAg(-1), a capacity as high as 89 mAhg(-1) was retained after 100 cycles, whereas SiOC showed a lower capacity of approximately 70 mAhg(-1).

Although conducting additives (typically carbon black) are essential components in slurry-coated cathodes, their modification received much less attentions as an alternative solution to the above-mentioned issues. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing catalytic materials to the conventional conducting additive of carbon black acts as a feasible strategy to improve battery performance. Super P carbon black decorated with FeP nanoparticles (SP/FeP) is synthesized using a scalable method and served as the conducting additive in sulfur cathodes constructed from common carbon hosts, namely carbon nanotubes and nanofibers. At a low addition of SP/FeP of 10 wt% (the conventional 8:1:1 recipe), SP/FeP exhibits strong sulfur immobilizations and effective electrocatalysis for the liquid-liquid and liquid-solid transitions. High specific capacities (1518 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), excellent rating performance (728 mAh g(-1) at 5 C) and stable longterm cycling are achieved. Pouch cells with a 7.0 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading are also demonstrated to present high areal capacities and charge/discharge stabilities. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations were performed to reveal the working mechanism of the SP/FeP conducting additive. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, to address this issue, a flexible Li-S interlayer consisting of a two-dimensional alpha-Co(OH)(2) nano-plate and graphene oxide (GO) is developed using a simple vacuum filtration technique. In the interlayer, the alpha-Co(OH)(2) and GO are assembled into a layered structure forming a physical barrier for the shuttling of LiPS. Additionally, the alpha-Co(OH)(2) offers strong chemical adsorption and efficient catalysis performance towards LiPS conversion, further inhibiting its shuttling. Attributed to these beneficial features of the interlayer, the Li-S battery delivers an initial discharge capacity of 834 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 1 C. More importantly, after 300 cycles, a high discharge capacity of 590 mAh g(-1) was retained, corresponding to a low capacity fading rate of 0.1% per cycle. This work might be of great interest for the feasible and scalable preparation of multifunctional interlayers in Li-S batteries.

We designed a dual carbon source precursor material, which benefits form merging the characteristics of the huge specific surface area of the MOF material and the excellent conductivity of carbon nanotubes to improve the performance of the lithium-sulfur battery. Furthermore, the added nickel rich metal phosphide can effectively improve the material's ability to adsorb polysulfides. When the addition amount of carbon nanotubes is optimized, the polarization voltage of the battery is reduced, which is conducive to the reaction kinetics of the battery. Due to the above-mentioned advantageous features, the specific capacity of the battery reaches 1453.5 mAh/g at a cycle rate of 0.1 C. In addition, after 500 cycles at 1 C, the coulombic efficiency of the battery always remains above 96%, and the retention rate of specific capacity is also above 90%. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur, dissolution of the active material, and sluggish reaction kinetics cause poor cycle stability and rate performance. A variety of approaches have been attempted to resolve the above issues and achieve enhanced electrochemical performance. However, inexpensive multifunctional host materials which can accommodate large quantities of sulfur and exhibit high electrode density are not widely available, which hinders the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Herein, mesoporous carbon microspheres with ultrahigh pore volume are synthesized, followed by the incorporation of Fe-N-C molecular catalysts into the mesopores, which can act as sulfur hosts. The ultrahigh pore volume of the prepared host material can accommodate up to similar to 87 wt % sulfur, while the uniformly controlled spherical morphology and particle size of the carbon microspheres enable high areal/volumetric capacity with high electrode density. Furthermore, the uniform distribution of Fe-N-C (only 0.33 wt %) enhances the redox kinetics of the conversion reaction of sulfur and efficiently captures the soluble intermediates. The resulting electrode with 5.2 mg sulfur per cm(2) shows excellent cycle stability and 84% retention of the initial capacity even after 500 cycles at a 3 C rate.

We used a modification of our previously reported low cost, scalable, and high-throughput solution-based method to deposit Li2S on graphene.

However, the shuttle effect limits their development. In this work, small-sized tin disulfide (SnS2) nanoparticles are embedded between interlayers of two-dimensional porous carbon nanosheets (PCNs), forming a multi-functional nanocomposite (PCN-SnS2) as a cathode carrier for Li-S batteries. The graphitized carbon nanosheets improve the overall conductivity of the electrode, and the abundant pores not only facilitate ion transfer and electrolyte permeation, but also buffer the volume change during the charge and discharge process to ensure the integrity of the electrode material. More importantly, the physical confinement of PCN, as well as the strong chemical adsorption and catalytic reaction of small SnS2 nanoparticles, synergistically reduce the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The interaction between a porous layered structure and physical-chemical confinement gives the PCN-SnS2-S electrode high electrochemical performance. Even at a high rate of 2 C, a discharge capacity of 650 mA h g(-1) is maintained after 150 cycles, underscoring the positive results of SnS2 based materials for Li S batteries. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique results further confirm that the PCN-SnS2-S electrode has a high Li+ transmission rate, which reduces the activation barrier and improves the electrochemical reaction kinetics. This work provides strong evidence that reducing the size of SnS2 nanostructures is beneficial for capturing and reacting with polysulfides to alleviate their shuttle effect in Li-S batteries.

However, the commercial use for Li-S batteries is immensely limited by the insulation of S, noticeable volume expansion from S to Li2S2/Li2S, and the undesired shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPs). Herein, a composite sulfur host has been prepared by in situ incorporations of cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) into nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (Co/N-PCSs) through the composite micelle assembly strategy. The resultant functional Co/N-PCSs not only possess uniform spherical morphology with large open mesopores, high surface area, and pore volume but also have small Co NPs homogeneously inlaid into the pore walls of carbon frameworks. Both the experimental and theoretical calculation results demonstrate that the formed cobalt NPs can efficiently accelerate the lithium-ion diffusion reaction and greatly entrap the soluble intermediate LiPs. Benefiting from the well-designed structure, the Co/N-PCSs@S cathode with a S loading of 73.82 wt % delivers superior electrochemical performance, including long cycling stability (60% for the residual capacity at 1 A g(-1) within 300 cycles) and excellent rate performance (similar to 512 mAh g(-1) at 6 A g(-1)). This design strategy of implanting metal NPs in mesoporous carbon can be inspiring in energy storage applications.

The as-prepared composites are characterized by thermal gravimetric, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption. In this composite, sulfur particle is encapsulated in the carbon shell even entering into the micropores of carbon Bp2000. The electrochemical performance of the S/C composites is evaluated. The results indicate that the S/C composite with 50 wt% sulfur content shows good reversibility, excellent rate capability, and slow degradation. It delivers an initial capacity of 784.4 mAh g(-1) (based on sulfur weight) and preserves at 598.3 mAh g(-1) after 195 cycles at 1C. It achieves a high-capacity retention of 76.27 % from the 5th to 200th cycle, and as high as 91.19 % during the latter 150 cycles. The improvement is mainly attributed to the favorable structure of the S/C composite, in which the carbon cannot only facilitate transport of electrons and Li+ ions but also trap polysulfides and retard the shuttle effect during charge/discharge process.

Herein, a poly(butyl acrylate/1-ethyl-3-vinylimidazole bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide)-based quasi-solid-state copolymer electrolyte poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA-P(BA-co-[EVIm]TFSI) QPE-IL) was prepared for lithium-sulfur batteries. The butyl acrylate component with abundant ester groups ensures the strong chemical capture for LiPSs. What is more, the introduction of ionic liquid ([EVIm]TFSI) can greatly improve the ionic conductivity and lithium-ion migration rate. More importantly, the dynamic-reversible adsorption of LiPSs was realized by chemical adsorption of ester-rich groups and electrostatic repulsion of free-moving negatively charged ions. As a result, the lithium-sulfur battery assembled by a reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube film@sulfur (rGOCTF@S) self-supporting cathode and QPE-IL displayed a high initial discharge capacity of 1179 mA h g(-1), good cycling stability (72% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C), and superior rate performance.

To address this issue, we designed a thin cathode inactive material interlayer modified separator to block polysulfides. There are two advantages for this strategy. First, the coating material totally comes from the cathode, thus avoids the additional weights involved. Second, the cathode inactive material modified separator improve the reversible capacity and cycle performance by combining gelatin to chemically bond polysulfides and the carbon layer to physically block polysulfides. The research results confirm that with the cathode inactive material modified separator, the batteries retain a reversible capacity of 644 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles, showing a low capacity decay of about 0.11% per circle at the rate of 0.5C.

For this purpose, the graphene-supported tin (IV) phosphate (Sn(HPO4)(2)center dot H2O, SnP) composites (SnP-G) are employed as the novel sulfur hosts in this work. When compared to the graphene-sulfur and carbon-sulfur composites, the SnP-G-sulfur composites exhibit much better cycling performance at 1.0C over 800cycles. Meanwhile, the pouch cell fabricated with the SnP-G-sulfur cathodes also exhibits excellent performance with an initial capacity of 1266.6 mAh g(-1) (S) and capacity retention of 76.9% after 100-cycles at 0.1C. The adsorption tests, density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with physical characterizations and electrochemical measurements provide insights into the mechanism of capture-accelerated conversion mechanism of polysulfide at the surface of SnP. DFT calculations indicate that the Li-O bond formed between Li atom (from Li2Sn, n = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) and O atom (from PO3-OH in SnP) is the main reason for the strong interactions between Li2Sn and SnP. As a result, SnP can effectively restrain the shuttle effect and improving the cycling performance of Li-S cell. In addition, by employing the climbing-image nudged elastic band (ciNEB) methods, the energy barrier for lithium sulfide decomposition (charging reaction) on SnP is proved to decrease significantly compared to that on graphene. It can be concluded that SnP is an effective sulfur hosts acting as dual-functional accelerators for the conversion reactions of polysulfide to sulfide (discharging reaction) as well as polysulfide to sulfur (charging reaction).

Understanding the effect of carbon structure factors on the electrochemical properties of sulfur/carbon composites helps in rational designing of the cathode material for optimized battery performance. We prepare reduced graphene oxide (RGO), cysteine-modified RGO (RGO-CYS), microwave-expanded graphite oxide (MEGO) and activated-MEGO (aMEGO) with specific surface areas (SSA) of 58-3010 m(2) g(-1), C/O atomic ratios of 2.41-10.81, pore sizes of 0.9-5.6 nm and pore volumes of 0.14-2.03 cm(3) g(-)1. The electrochemical performance researches S/RGO-CYS > S/RGO > S/MEGO > S/aMEGO when it is listed in the order of their specific capacity, rate capability and cyclic life. And the S/RGO-CYS delivers a high reversible capacity of 455 mA h g(-1) at 8 C. The excellent performance of S/RGO-CYS composite is ascribed to the sulfur-containing functional groups of the RGOCYS, which helps the sulfur dispersion and stabilizes the dissoluble lithium polysulfides. Our results demonstrate that the surface chemistry of carbon materials plays a more important role than the SSA, pore size and pore volume for the electrochemical properties of sulfur/carbon composites for Li-S batteries.

However, their fast capacity fading and low reaction kinetics still remain a challenge. In the present study, a unique bistructural porous carbon hybrid of fibers with carbon nanotube as core and nitrogen/ oxygen dual-doped porous carbon as coating layer is synthesized by a self-assembly approach. The one-dimensional (1D) hybrid has large surface area, high porosity, rich nitrogen/ oxygen dual-doping and high conductivity, which is admirable as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur battery cathodes. This novel structural carbon host enables the sulfur cathode a significant cyclic stability and superior rate capability. With a sulfur loading as high as 75 wt%, the sulfur cathode achieves an initial capacity of 1110mAh g(-1) and a capacity of 684mAh g(-1) retains after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. This work offers a new structural 1D porous carbon host and its fabrication method for high efficiency sulfur cathodes. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The cavity diameter and wall thickness of HCNs can be easily controlled by activation time. Owing to their large inner cavity and enclosed structure, HCNs are desirable carriers for encapsulating sulfur. To better understand the effects of pore characteristics and sulfur contents on the performances of lithium-sulfur batteries, three composites of HCNs and sulfur are prepared and studied in detail. The composites of HCNs with moderate specific surface areas and suitable sulfur content present a better performance. The first discharge capacity of this composite reaches 1401 mAhg(-1) at 0.2 C.

However, their practical application is hindered by the fast capacity decay caused by the "shuttle effect" of intermediate lithium polysulfides during cycling. In this study, we combine graphene (G) with the organic molecule 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) to form the G-PTCDA composite as the host material of sulfur cathodes. In particular, PTCDA with the conjugated benzene rings and the anhydride group is absorbed tightly on graphene through pi-pi stacking and thus enhances the polarity and conductivity of the G-PTCDA composite. Meanwhile, PTCDA can capture the otherwise dissolved intermediate polysulfides on the sulfur cathode by forming the Li-O bond with the oxygen atoms on the acid anhydride group in a collaborative manner. Thus, the "shuttle effect" can be effectively depressed, and the electrochemical performance is improved during discharge and charge cycling. We hope that the findings of this study can provide a deeper understanding of the design and preparation of the sulfur-based composite cathode material with functional organic molecules for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Polyurethane foam is a typical commercial polymer with a large production quantity and its waste needs to be recycled. Lithium-sulfur battery is a promising energy-storage device with high energy density and low cost, but its demerits such as poor conductivity of the sulfur and severe capacity degradation due to the soluble lithium polysulfides are still a big challenge. This work reports a facile method to prepare nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) from the polyurethane foam (PUF) waste and use it as a reservoir to impregnate sulfur for lithium-sulfur batteries. The obtained NPC has a unique interconnected sheet-like porous morphology with a large surface area of 1315 m(2) g(-1). The NPC-S composite delivers a large reversible capacity of 1118 mAh g(-1) with good cycling performances and excellent high-rate capabilities. A large reversible capacity of 460 mAh g(-1) can be retained at a large current of 5C (8.35 A g(-1)) after 100 cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To realize both high areal and volumetric capacity of lithium-sulfur batteries, while maintaining flexible and mechanically robust characteristics, is challenging for their portable energy storage applications. Herein, interface covalent bonding was demonstrated to design densely-packed graphene/CoS2/nano-sulfur hybrid papers with flexible and robust characteristics for energy-dense, compact and foldable lithium-sulfur batteries. The asdesigned paper cathodes showed excellent cycling stability with a low decay rate of 0.044% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C, as well as high reversible areal capacity (4.11 mAh cm-2) and volumetric capacity (1240 Ah L-1). Meanwhile, the assembled batteries performed a high gravimetric/volumetric energy density (363.5 Wh kg- 1/378 Wh L-1) under high sulfur loading (5.6 mg cm-2) and lean electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S: 5 ?L mg-1). Furthermore, durable pouch cells based on as-designed integrated paper cathodes showed negligible performance decay even at a folding angle of 180?, highlighting their practical applications for flexible power systems.

J	Chen, F; Cheng, XQ; Zhao, ZX; Wang, XM				Chen, Feng; Cheng, Xiaoqin; Zhao, Zhenxin; Wang, Xiaomin			Hierarchical Porous N, P co-doped rGO Modified Separator to Enhance the Cycling Stability of Lithium-sulfur Batteries	ACTA CHIMICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						lithium-sulfur battery; lithium polysulfide; NPG; modified separator; shuttle effect	REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; 3-DIMENSIONAL NITROGEN; CARBON; CATHODE; POLYSULFIDES; HOST; CONVERSION; FRAMEWORK; SHEETS	Lithium-sulfur batteries with high energy density (2600 Wh.kg(-1)) and theoretical capacity (1675 mAh.g(-1)) have attracted much attention. Furthermore, as a cathode active material, sulfur has prominent advantages such as rich in natural resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. Attributed to the above merits, lithium-sulfur batteries deemed to be one of the most promising energy storage devices. However, poor utilization of sulfur and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) causes dramatic capacity degradation, which severely restricts the commercial application of lithium-sulfur batteries. These problems are mainly attributed to the insulating nature of sulfur and its final discharge products (Li2S2/Li2S), which reduces the sulfur utilization, as well as the poor adsorption capability and slow reaction kinetics, which give rise to the shuttle effect of soluble LiPSs. To solve the above problems, carbon materials are regarded as the most suitable cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries, because its superior electrical conductivity and rich porous structure can effectively improve the sulfur utilization and mitigate the shuttle effect of LiPSs. However, the shuttling of LiPSs is difficult to suppressed completely due to the weak adsorption interaction between nonpolar carbon materials and polar LiPSs. Based on this, heteroatom doping is beneficial to enrich the chemical adsorption sites of LiPSs in carbon materials, enhancing the interaction between carbon materials and LiPSs. Thus, the shuttle effect of LiPSs is efficiently suppressed and the cycle stability of lithium-sulfur batteries is improved. Hence, N, P co-doped reduced graphene oxide (NPG) with hierarchical porous structure was prepared by one-step high-temperature reduction method and used for the polypropylene (PP) separator modification of lithium-sulfur batteries. The highly conductive NPG with abundant hierarchical porous structure provides a large number of anchor sites for LiPSs and sufficient ion/electron transport channels, facilitating the conversion of the soluble intermediates and efficiently suppressing the shuttle effect of LiPSs. In consequence, the NPG/PP modified separator can effectively inhibit the shuttle of LiPSs and improve the sulfur utilization. The results show that the cells with NPG/PP modified separator exhibit excellent cycling performance (the degradation per cycle is only 0.052% and the capacity remains at 612.5 mAh.g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C) and excellent rate performance (high specific capacity of 617.9 mAh.g(-1) at 2 degrees C). This idea of constructing hierarchical porous N, P co-doped rGO modified separators provides a new strategy for the study of lithium-sulfur battery.

In this study, we synthesized WO3 nanowires (WNWs) via a simple hydrothermal method. WNWs and one-dimensional materials are easily mixed with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form interlayers. The WNW interacts with lithium polysulfides through a thiosulfate mediator, retaining the lithium polysulfide near the cathode to increase the reaction kinetics. The lithium-sulfur cell achieves a very high initial discharge capacity of 1558 and 656 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 and 3 C, respectively. Moreover, a cell with a high sulfur mass loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2) still delivers a high capacity of 1136 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 C and it showed a capacity of 939 mAh g(-1) even after 100 cycles. The WNW/CNT interlayer maintains structural stability even after electrochemical testing. This excellent performance and structural stability are due to the chemical adsorption and catalytic effects of the thiosulfate mediator on WNW.

J	Xu, HH; Manthiram, A				Xu, Henghui; Manthiram, Arumugam			Hollow cobalt sulfide polyhedra-enabled long-life, high areal-capacity lithium-sulfur batteries	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Cobalt sulfide; Polysulfide trapping; Sulfur loading	GRAPHITIC CARBON NANOCAGES; BINDER-FREE ELECTRODE; S BATTERIES; NANOTUBE NETWORK; CYCLE-LIFE; PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDE; CATHODE; NANOPARTICLES; NANOSHEETS	Improving the electron and ion transport in sulfur electrodes and suppressing the lithium polysulfide shuttle have been the two major challenges with lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Here, we present a composite paper electrode consisting of hollow Co3S4 polyhedra, activated carbon nanofibers (ACNF), and pure sulfur powder for Li-S batteries. The hollow Co3S4 polyhedra with a porous shell structure provide large spaces to accommodate the polysulfides, possess ideal polar chemisorptive capability for immobilizing the polysulfide species, and have a higher conductivity than many polar metal oxides, facilitating fast reaction kinetics with the Li-S batteries. The composite electrode exhibits high sulfur utilization and maintains superior cycling stability in Li-S batteries with a high sulfur areal mass. A high capacity of 953 mAhg(-1) at 1C rate could be achieved with a sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm(-2),and the capacity remains at 610 mAh g(-1) after 450 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading of 13.5 mg cm(-2), the composite electrode delivers a high areal capacity of 13 mAh cm(-2) at 0.3C rate.

The resulting MC spheres, possessing hierarchical pores in the range of 3-30 nm, are employed as conductive matrices for the preparation of cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. A high pressure induced one-step impregnation of elemental sulfur into the pore of the MC spheres has been exploited. The electrochemical performances of sulfur-impregnated MC spheres (S-MC) derived from MC spheres with different pore volume and specific surface area but with the same sulfur loading ratio of 60 wt% (S-MC-X-60) have been investigated in details. The S-MC-4-60 composite cathode material displayed a high initial discharge capacity of 1388 mAhg(-1) and a good cycling stability of 857 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C, and shows also excellent rate capability of 864 mAhg(-1) at 2C. More importantly, the sulfur loading content in MC-4 spheres can reach as high as 80%, and it still can deliver a capacity of 569 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the severe shuffling and depressed conversion of lithium polysulfides in sulfur cathode are two pivotal factors that limit the practical application of Li-S batteries. To solve these issues, rationally designed hollow polyhedra/carbon nanotube confined CoP nanoparticles superstructures (CoP@HPCN) for enhanced Li-S batteries are proposed here. With the high porosity and cavity, and multidirectional channels, hollow polyhedra/carbon nanotube architecture can effectively accommodate volume expansion and entrap sulfur species. More importantly, the experimental and theoretical results indicate that the uniformly inserted polar CoP nanoparticles as electrocatalyst not only significantly anchor polysulfides, but also catalyze the transformation of lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from these advantages, the CoP@HPCN based sulfur cathode can achieve good rate performance, impressive cycling stability, and ultralow self-discharge constant of 0.03% per day after resting for 60 days even at high sulfur loading of 3.7 mg cm(-2). This work synergistically combines desired design and electrocatalysis in sulfur electrode and sheds some light on the construction of advanced Li-S batteries.

Carbon nanoparticles and the polar groups of the polymers were responsible for boosting the reaction kinetics of sulfur and the chemical and physical trapping of lithium polysulfides. The adsorption of sulfur species in the coated separators was confirmed by the morphologic changes observed in the AFM and SEM images and by the new elements presented in the EDX spectra after 100 charge/discharge cycles. The high intensity of the peaks in the cyclic voltammograms and the long plateaus in the discharge profiles support the improvement in the reaction kinetics. The batteries with the carbon black/chitosan- and carbon black/polyvinylidene fluoride-coated separators reached high specific discharge capacities of 833 and 698 mAhg(-1), respectively, after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. This is promising for this kind of technology, and detailed results are presented in the article.

Herein, we have designed a binary host featuring highly sulfiphilic Ni-Fe bimetallic oxide (NiFe2O4) nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanotubes for Li-S batteries. NiFe2O4 nanoparticles provide highly sulfiphilic sites to confine lithium polysulfides by the formation of Li-O and S-O bonds, and act as an electrocatalyst to promote the conversion of polysulfides. The carbon nanotubes play an important synergistic role by providing efficient electron conduction pathways and preventing agglomeration of the catalyst. As a result, the sulfur cathode enables stable cycling with a very low capacity fade rate (similar to 0.029% per cycle upon 1000 cycles) at 1.0 C and a reversible capacity of similar to 550 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C. Further, the superior cycling stability could be retained even for high sulfur loading of similar to 5.0 mg cm(-2). The development of such hybrid electrodes comprised of bimetallic oxides supported on carbon nanotubes could help realize long-lasting and stable Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrogen-doped carbon material (N-C) has not only good electronic conductivity but also stronger chemical adsorption with intermediates of polysulfides, thus can effectively alleviate the shuttle effect. Riboflavin with advantages of cheap and nontoxic carbon/nitrogen source will be used to synthesize N-C, and will be firstly applied as sulfur host. The obtained N-C/S electrode shows initial capacity of 773.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and capacity retention of 76.6% after 100 cycles, the capacity retention capability is much better than that of XC-72/S electrode with same sulfur content. Even at bigger current density of 1 C, the specific capacity of the battery is still up to 353.3 mAh g(-1). This excellent performance of the N-C/S electrode is ascribed to strong chemical binding of polysulfides to N-C.

However, the poor conductivity, large volumetric expansion of sulfur and dissolution of the intermediate polysulfides result in poor cyclic stability. Herein, sulfur-silica-carbon nanofiber (S-SiO2-CNF) based ternary composite cathode materials are prepared via simple heat treatment for lithium-sulfur batteries. The prepared materials are physically subjected to x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, surface area and porosity analyses. The prepared S-SiO2-CNF cathode material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 801 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with a decay rate of 0.18% per cycle up to 300 cycles. The significantly enhanced electrochemical performance of the S-SiO2-CNF cathode is ascribed to the micro and mesoporous nature of prepared material and binding nature of silica, which restricting the volume changes of active material and limits the polysulfide dissolution.

The strategy to achieve a high utilization of active materials with high energy efficiency is strongly requested for practical applications with less energy loss during repeated cycling. In this contribution, a metal/nanocarbon layer current collector is proposed to enhance the redox reactions of polysulfides in a working Li-S cell. Such a concept is demonstrated by coating graphene-carbon nanotube hybrids (GNHs) on routine aluminum (Al) foil current collectors. The interfacial conductivity and adhesion between the current collector and active material are significantly enhanced. Such novel cell configuration with metal/nanocarbon layer current collectors affords abundant Li ions for rapid redox reactions with small overpotential. Consequently, the Li-S cells with nanostructured current collectors exhibit an initial discharge capacity of 1,113 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, which is similar to 300 mAh g(-1) higher than those without a GNH coating layer. The capacity retention is 73% for cells with GNH after 300 cycles. A reduced voltage hysteresis and a high energy efficiency of ca. 90% are therefore achieved. Moreover, the Al/GNH layer current collectors are easily implanted into current cell assembly process for energy storage devices based on complex multi-electron redox reactions (e.g., Li-S batteries, Li-O-2 batteries, fuel cells, and flow batteries).

In this work, a UiO-66@carbon (UiO-66@CC) interlayer was developed for Li-S battery by growing a continuous UiO-66 film on carbon cloth. The continuous UiO-66 crystal layer contributes to provide sufficient adsorptive and catalytic sites for efficient adsorption and catalytic conversion towards polysulfides. Moreover, the hydrophilic property of UiO-66 material ensures the full infiltration of electrolyte and accelerates the transportation of lithium ions. Profiting from the above advantages of the proposed interlayer, the shuttle effect is effectively inhibited and a fast redox kinetic is also realized. Accordingly, the Li-S battery using UiO-66@CC delivers a specific capacity of 1228.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with a nearly 100% capacity retention after 100 cycles, and the first specific capacity is 1033.1 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C with a decay rate of 0.07% over 600 cycles. Meanwhile, UiO-66@CC interlayer also has an excellent rate performance with a specific capacity of 535.9 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C and a high area capacity of 6.2 mAh cm(-2) at increased sulfur loading (8.15 mg cm(-2)).

Biomass-derived, activated carbon-sulfur composite cathode with a bifunctional interlayer of functionalized carbon nanotubes for lithium-sulfur cells	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur cell; Activated carbon; CNTF interlayer; Lithium polysulfides; Solvothermal method	ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; RATE-CAPABILITY; ACID TREATMENT; HIGH-CAPACITY; GRAPHENE; BATTERIES; CARBONIZATION; CHALLENGES; ELECTRODE; OXYGEN	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells are emerging as the dominant constituents of the next generation battery technology, offering high theoretical capacity around 1675 mA h g(-1) and the additional advantages of low cost and non-toxic nature. Activated carbon, derived from natural resources is being extensively investigated for applications as electrode materials in high power supercapacitors and for making composite electrodes for designing high energy density electrochemical cells. The present work is aimed at introducing the potential of the composite cathode of sulfur with the biomass-derived, steam activated carbon (AC) along with the free-standing and flexible film of carbon nanotubes as the interlayer for designing efficient Li-S cells. The composite obtained by impregnating sulfur particles into the pores of coconut shell derived and steam activated carbon, subjected to efficient acid washing procedures to attain maximum purity, called as the activated carbon-sulfur (ACS) is used as the composite cathode material. The flexible film of acid-functionalized carbon nanotubes termed as the CNTF placed between the composite cathode and the separator material serves as an active interlayer to boost the performance efficiency of the assembled Li-S cells. The ACS composite is synthesized by the solvothermal method, and the flexible CNTF is obtained by solution casting. The Li-S cells assembled with the ACS composite as the active cathode material and the CNTF as the interlayer are found to exhibit quite impressive discharge capacity and cycling stability. These cells deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1562 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C rate and retain 71% of the initial capacity at 1 C rate after 200 cycles. The conducting and the porous network of the ACS helps to enhance the overall electrical conductivity of the sulfur composite cathode and the highly conducting CNTF interlayer accelerates the electrochemical activity taking place in the cell. The interlayer restricts the polysulfides from migrating to the anode and thereby suppresses the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon. The use of the coconut shell derived, steam activated and acid washed carbon for making the composite cathode with sulfur and the CNTF interlayer, obtained by the acid functionalization of carbon nanotubes is a novel approach to realize Li-S cells with high capacity and excellent cycling stability, which has not yet been pursued in detail.

Herein, a lightweight nanoporous TiO2 and graphene oxide (GO) composite is prepared and utilized as an interlayer between a Li anode and a sulfur cathode to suppress the polysulfide migration and improve the electrochemical performance of Li/S batteries. The interlayer can capture the polysulfides due to the presence of oxygen functional groups and formation of chemical bonds. The hierarchically porous TiO2 nanoparticles are tightly wrapped in GO sheets and facilitate the polysulfide storage and chemical absorption. The excellent adhesion between TiO2 nanoparticles and GO sheets resulted in enhanced conductivity, which is highly desirable for an efficient electron transfer process. The Li/S battery with a TiO2/GO-coated separator exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1102.8 mAh g(-1) and a 100th cycle capacity of 843.4 mAh g(-1), which corresponds to a capacity retention of 76.48% at a current rate of 0.2 C. Moreover, the Li/S battery with the TiO2/GO-coated separator showed superior cyclic performance and excellent rate capability, which shows the promise of the TiO2/GO composite in next-generation Li/S batteries.

Herein, a dual-engineered separator is designed through double-side construction of ammonium alcohol polyvinyl phosphate/carbon black (AAPP/CB) constituted "polysulfide stockroom" and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)(3) (LAGP) based "ion guider" on a commercial polypropylene (PP) substrate. Such functional separator AAPP/CB@PP@LAGP enables highly robust, all-climate Li-S batteries, which is attributed to the efficient polysulfide-absorption/conversion function of the AAPP/CB layer and uniform Li ion distribution/transport capacity induced by the LAGP layer. It is anticipated that this work may provide a promising strategy for interface engineering of separators and promote the wide-temperature application of Li-S batteries.

With a specific surface area as high as 1001.2 m(2) g(-1) and a unique porous structure, MPC in the composites can not only absorb the polysulfides generated during charge-discharge process to slow down the shuttle effect, but provide Li+ with a transmission channel. Nano-Mg0.6Ni0.4O (40 nm) particles, as an additive fabricated by self-propagating high temperature synthesis, can promote chemical bond dissociation with polysulfides and accelerate the electrochemical reaction rate. The composites loaded with 59 wt% sulfur exhibit a high initial capacity of 1360 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 695 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, proving that the synergistic effect between MPC and Nano-Mg0.6Ni0.4O leads to good cycle stability of the batteries.

However, such battery still faces many obstacles, mainly including the shuttle effect of polysulfides and sluggish reaction kinetics of the electrode actions. Herein, a freestanding metallic tin-modified and nitrogen-doped carbon-skeleton (TCS) was designed and used as the interlayer for Li-S batteries to efficiently mitigate the above issues and sustain a long lifespan. Here, the carbon skeleton builds a high-effective conductive network for the whole interface, while the uniformly distributed metallic tin nanoparticles act as an absorbent of polysulfides and a catalyst to promote the conversion of sulfur species. As a result, both the specific capacity and cycle stability of Li-S battery are significantly improved with the assistance of the TCS interlayer. With a high sulfur content of 72.6 wt%, Li-S battery used TCS as interlayer shows an ultrahigh initial capacity of 1123.1 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and a high capacity retention of 92.8% after 100 cycles. Besides, when the sulfur areal loading increased to 3.67 mg cm(-2), it still keeps a high areal capacity of 3.15 mA h cm(-2) under a current density of 0.2C, and the decay rate in the first 50 cycles is only 0.0043%. As such, this work will provide a facile and practical strategy to the development of a long cycling Li-S battery.

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations show the hollow structures of the HCNF and the homogeneous distribution of sulfur in the composite. The performance of the HCNF-S cathode is evaluated in lithium-sulfur batteries using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is found that the HCNF-S cathode shows perfect cycling stability. The results exhibit an initial discharge capacity of 1090 mAh g(-1) and retains 600 mAh g(-1) after 100 discharge/charge cycles at a high rate of 1 C. The excellent electrochemical properties benefit from the hollow and highly conductive network-like structure of HCNFs, which contribute to disperse sulfur and absorb polysulfides, and suppress the formation of residual Li2S layer.

Herein, a highly oriented MIL-101(Cr) continuous film is developed on carbon cloth and utilized as trustworthy interlayer for lithium-sulfur batteries. This interlayer possesses a unique hierarchical porous structure and abundant active sites, providing efficient confinement of polysulfides through strong physical/chemical adsorption. Specially, the Lewis acidic Cr(III) centers of MIL-101(Cr) films are able to coordinate with polysulfides through Lewis acid-base interactions. Moreover, MIL-101(Cr) films also have the electrocatalytic effect of promoting the conversion of polysulfides. Benefiting from these features, this composite interlayer establishes an efficient barrier to inhibit the shuttling of polysulfides. Consequently, the as-prepared multifunctional interlayer exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 635 mAh g(-1) at 3 C, a superior cycle stability with a low-capacity decay of 0.039% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C and high areal specific capacity of 4.3 mAh cm(-2) under raised sulfur loading (5.1 mg cm(-2)).

In this work, we in situ polymerized a cross-linked binder in sulfur cathode to solve the aforementioned problems using a facile method under mild conditions. Polycarbonate diol (PCDL), triethanolamine (TEA) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) were chosen as precursors to prepare the cross-linked binder. The in situ polymerized binder (PTH) builds a strong network in sulfur cathode, which could restrain the volume expansion of sulfur. Moreover, by adopting functional groups of oxygen atoms and nitrogen atoms, the binder could effectively facilitate transportation of Li-ion and adsorb polysulfide chemically. The Li-S battery with bare sulfur and carbon/sulfur composite cathodes and cross-linked PTH binder displays much better electrochemical performance than that of the battery with PVDF. The PTH-bare S cathode with a mass loading of 5.97 mg/cm(2) could deliver a capacity of 733.3 mAh/g at 0.2 C, and remained 585.5 mAh/g after 100 cycles. This in situ polymerized binder is proved to be quite effective on restraining the volume expansion and suppressing polysulfide shuttle effect, then improving the electrochemical performance of Li-S battery.

Herein, a new phase engineering strategy is demonstrated for making MXene/1T-2H MoS2-C nanohybrids for boosting the performance of Li-S batteries in terms of capacity, rate ability, and stability. It is found that the plentiful positively charged S-vacancy defects created on MXene/1T-2H MoS2-C, proved by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, can serve as strong adsorption and activation sites for polar polysulfide intermediates, accelerate redox reactions, and prevent the dissolution of polysulfides. As a consequence, the novel MXene/1T-2H MoS2-C-S cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1194.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, a high level of capacity retention of 799.3 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5 C, and reliable operation in soft-package batteries. The present MXene/1T-2H MoS2-C becomes among the best cathode materials for Li-S batteries.

While the MWCNT is inherently highly conductive and mechanically strong, the cost can be significant and in turn hampered wider application of MWCNT protection layers. Here, we employed lignin, a byproduct during high-quality bleached paper manufacturing, to replace a portion of MWCNT in the protection layer to reduce cost and enhance surface properties of pristine MWCNT protection layers. We found that the protection layer with 25 wt% lignin leads to the best overall electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries during charging/discharging at 0.5 degrees C and 1C rate (1C = 1,675 mA g(-1)) among various weight-ratios of lignin/MWCNT, and a low decay rate (0.20% per cycle) and high initial capacity (1342 mA g(-1) and 1437 mA g(-1) for 1C and 0.5C, respectively) are demonstrated. Besides, Li-S cells with 25 wt% lignin/MWCNT composite protection layer also exhibited great rate capability, of which the specific capacities at 0.1C, 0.5C, 1C, and 2C were 1150, 913, 824, and 637 mAh g(-1), respectively. The enhanced electrochemical stability and performance of Li-S batteries can be attributed to strengthened polysulfide trapping and improved lithium ion transport with lignin reinforced MWCNT protection layers. We showcased an economic approach to extend cycle life and improve rate capability of Li-S batteries.

However, commercial applications of Li-S batteries still have been hindered by several issues, such as low sulfur utilization, self discharge, low efficiency, and poor cycling stability mainly caused by shuttle effect. beta-Cyclodextrins (beta-CDs) are well-known supramolecular hosts, capable of including hydrophobic molecules inside their large cavities. Taking advantage of the remarkable molecular recognition properties of beta-CDs, they are thus expected to effectively suppress shuttle effect by dynamically forming supramolecular inclusion complexes with the polysulfides. Here, we introduce a new strategy of using beta-cyclodextrin polymers (beta-CDPs) as supramolecular receptors chemically grafted onto reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO) to construct ternary supramolecular nanostructure of rGO@CDP@S hybrid cathode for Li-S batteries. Interestingly, this proof-of-concept model system has successfully demonstrated reversible capture and release of lithium polysulfides to confine an unfavorable polysulfide shuttle effect via supramolecular host-guest interaction in Li-S batteries. Furthermore, interaction mechanism between beta-CD and polysulfide was deeply investigated at the molecular level. More importantly, the {cyclodextrin/polysulfide} supramolecular inclusion complex was first isolated and fully characterized with a wide range of spectroscopic experiments and computational studies. The cyclodextrins-modified graphene-base sulfur cathode rGO@beta-CDP@S exhibits remarkably enhanced electrochemical performances in terms of higher specific capacity (1329 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C), rate capability (387 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 C), and excellent cycle life (capacity decay rate of 0.040% and 0.053% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 2.0 and 3.0 C), compared to pristine graphene-coated rGO@S composite. Moreover, it enables good cycling performance of high-sulfur-loading cathodes (S mass-loading of 5.3 mg cm(-2)) achieving discharge capacity of 560 mAh g(-1) (Areal capacities: 3.0 mA h cm(-2)) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles. The results open up a rational approach to shed new lights on designing new functional molecular materials as cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Though various in situ and ex situ characterization techniques have been deployed in recent years, many spatial aspects related to the local electrochemical phenomena of the Li-S electrode are not elucidated. Herein, we introduce the atomic-force-microscopy-based scanning electrochemical microscopy (AFM SECM) technique to study the Li-S interfacial redox reactions at nanoscale spatial resolution in real time. In situ electrochemical and alternating current (AC) phase mappings of Li2S particle during oxidation directly distinguished the presence of both conducting and insulating regions within itself. During charging, the conducting part undergoes dissolution, whereas the insulating part, predominantly Li2S, chemically/electrochemically reacts with intermediate LiPS. At higher oxidation potentials, as-reacted LiPS turns into insulating products, which accumulate over cycling, resulting in reduction of active material utilization and ultimately leading to capacity fade. The interdependence of the topography and electrochemical oxidative behavior of Li2S on the carbon surface by AFM SECM reveals the Li2S morphology activity relationship and provides new insights into the capacity fading mechanism in Li-S batteries.

N,S-HPC shows the interconnected hierarchical porous network, which enables sulfur to be uniformly dispersed in the carbon matrix thus accelerating the transport of electrons and lithium ions. The S@N,S-HPC composite cathode exhibits a high capacity utilization of 1106 mA h/g at 0.2 C, together with excellent rate capacity of 600 mA h/g at 2 C, and also superior cycle life over 500 cycles with a capacity decay of 0.08 % per cycle at 1 C. The outstanding electrochemical performances for S@N,S-HPC cathode are mainly ascribed to the hierarchical porous structure of carbon and N/S co-doping, which offers sufficient interface for the deposition of solid discharge products and impedes the diffusion of polysulfides due to both physical confinement and chemical interaction by porous carbon matrix and N/S atoms.

Here, we designed and synthesized a graphene-like oxygenated carbon nitride (OCN) host material that contains tens of micrometer scaled two-dimensional (2D) rippled sheets, micromesopores, and oxygen heteroatoms. N content can reach as high as 20.49 wt %. A sustainable approach of one-step self-supporting solid-state pyrolysis (OSSP) was developed for the low-cost and large-scale production of OCN. The urea in solid sources not only provides self-supporting atmospheres but also produces graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) working as 2D layered templates. The S/OCN cathode can deliver a high specific capacity of 1407.6 mA h g(-1) at C/20 rate with 84% S utilization and retain improved reversible capacity during long-term cycles at high current density. The increasing micropores, graphitic N, ether, and carboxylic 0 at the large sized OCN sheet favor S utilization and trapping for polysulfides.

However, poor conductivity of sulfur, large volume expansion, and lithium polysulfide dissolution limit LSBs application and promotion. In this work, graphitic hollow carbon fibers (HCF) were fabricated as a matrix to encapsulate sulfur. And nickel particles were introduced into fibers (Ni@HCF) to improve the cycle stability of sulfur cathode. On one hand, hollow structures can encapsulate sulfur and limit lithium polysulfides dissolution, and the graphitic carbon walls can provide a fast electron transport channel. On the other hand, nickel particles can accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfides. The study results show that the initial discharge specific capacity of Ni@HCF/S cathodes reaches 1,252 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 0.1C. And the capacity can be maintained at 558 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at the current density of 1C.

And renewable biomass-derived carbon materials play an important role in improving their electrochemical performance due to their heteroatoms-doping, electrical conductivity and exceptional porous structure. Here, xanthoceras sorbifolia husks have been employed to prepare amorphous porous carbon (XSH-PC) for NIBs and LSBs. As an anode material for NIBS, XSH-PC delivers a reversible specific capacity of 269.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 A g(-1) with initial coulombic efficiency as high as 65.9%, and retains stable capacity of 113 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 A g(-1). As well, after sulfur loading, as obtained XSH-PC/S composite shows stable coulombic efficiencies of 100 +/- 0.3% and a reversible specific capacity of 442.4 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 2 A g(-1) with a low average capacity decay rate of 0.065% per cycle when used for LSBs. These excellent electrochemical properties can be attributed to the unique structure of XSH-PC showing mesoporous structure with abundant carbon edge defects and large specific surface areas. These results illuminate the potential application of xanthoceras sorbifolia husks-derived porous carbon in NIBs and LSBs.

An Efficient Electrochemical Tanks-in-Series Model for Lithium Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Electrochemical Engineering; Mathematical Modeling; Efficient Simulation; Batteries; Lithium; Lithium Sulfur Batteries	POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; PRECIPITATION; MECHANISM; CARBON	This article applies and efficiently implements the Tanks-in-Series methodology (J. Electrochem. Soc., 167, 013534 (2020)) to generate a computationally efficient electrochemical model for Lithium-Sulfur batteries. The original Tank model approach for Lithium-ion batteries is modified to account for porosity changes with time. In addition, an exponential scaling method is introduced that enables efficient simulation of the model equations to address the wide range of time constants present for different reactions in the Lithium-Sulfur system. The Tank Model achieves acceptable voltage error even for transport-limited discharged conditions. Predictions of internal electrochemical variables are examined, and electrochemical implications of the approximations discussed. This suggests significant potential for real-time applications such as optimal charging, cell-balancing, and estimation, and represents a step forward in efforts to incorporate detailed electrochemical models in advanced Battery Management Systems for Lithium-Sulfur batteries.

However, the conversion-type redox mechanism determines the poor fulfillment of battery chemistry in terms of reversibility and kinetics. Herein, a flower-like graphene microassembly decorated with finely-dispersed Ni2Co nanoalloy (Ni2Co@rGO) is developed as advanced host matrix for Li-S batteries. Combining computational, physicochemical, and electrochemical studies, Ni2Co nanoalloys are unveiled synergizing strong adsorbability against polysulfide shuttling and excellent catalytic activity for sulfur conversions. Meanwhile, the sophisticated architecture renders facile electron/ion transport and highly-exposed active interfaces. These virtues collaboratively contribute to fast and durable sulfur electrochemistry with a minimum capacity degradation of 0.034% per cycle over 500 cycles and a rate capability up to 5 C. Besides, the implementation of Ni2Co@rGO as the anode matrix tames the Li redox behavior benefiting from the enhanced lithiophilicity and reduced local current density. As such, the full cell configuration pairing S-Ni2Co@rGO cathode and Li-Ni2Co@rGO anode realizes a favorable areal capacity of 4.53 mAh cm(-2) under high sulfur loading (4.0 mg cm(-2)) and limited electrolyte (E/S = 6.0 mL g(-1)). This work offers an elaborate bi-service matrix engineering to simultaneously improve the conversion reversibility and kinetics for superior Li-S batteries.

In this paper, by a simple two-step liquid phase reaction, we reported a core-shell structural S@polyaniline/SiO2 (SPS) composite imitating the cellular structure, which is expected to be catalytic for chemical reactions, including electron transfer and are able to adsorb lithium polysulphides. The results show that the SPS composites exhibit superior specific capacity and good cycling stability due to the role of complementary advantages of both polyaniline and SiO2 for lithium-sulfur batteries. The initial specific discharge capacity of SPS cathode is 805 mAh g(-1) and the capacity retains at 460 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.2 C. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to both the functional groups on the silica nanoparticles that anchor the sulfur and polysulfides and the polyaniline that helps to produce channels for the electrolyte and polysulfide to enter.

In this paper, the macadamia nut shells are used as the precursor to prepare porous carbon material. By exploring the effect of temperature on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of porous carbon materials during activation, it is found that the porous carbon material prepared under the activation condition of 900 degrees C has a developed pore structure, super high specific surface area (3552.7 m(2)center dot g(-1)), larger pore volume (2.2 cm(3)center dot g(-1)) and higher mesoporous content (23.85%). And the composite cathode material with the sulfur content of 70.1% has the highest specific capacity, and the initial discharge specific capacity for 0.2 C can reach 942.4 mAh center dot g(-1). The composite material S/OCNT@OPC-1:1 obtained by compounding it with carbon nanotubes at a mass ratio of 1:1 has higher specific capacity, better rate performance and cycle performance. At 0.2 C, the initial discharge specific capacity is as high as 1252.6 mAh center dot g(-1), and it remains at the level of 717.3 mAh center dot g(-1) after 200 cycles. Even at 1 C, the specific capacity is still 984.3 mAh center dot g(-1), and it remains at 690.9 mAh center dot g(-1) after 200 cycles, and the capacity retention rate is 70.2%. Our work shows that the composite material obtained by combining low-cost biomass carbon materials and carbon nanotubes as the cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries has obvious advantages.

However, conventional binders have intrinsic drawbacks such as poor capability of absorbing hydrophilic lithium polysulfides, resulting in severe capacity decay. This study reports a new type of binder by polymerization of hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether with polyethylenimine, which enables strongly anchoring polysulfides for high-performance lithium sulfur batteries, demonstrating remarkable improvement in both mechanical performance for standing up to 100 g weight and an excellent capacity retention of 72% over 400 cycles at 1.5 C. Importantly, in situ micro-Raman investigation verifies the effectively reduced polysulfides shuttling from sulfur cathode to lithium anode, which shows the greatly suppressed shuttle effect by the polar-functional binder. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis into the discharge intermediates upon battery cycling reveals that the hydrophilic binder endows the sulfur electrodes with multidimensional Li-O, Li-N, and S-O interactions with sulfur species to effectively mitigate lithium polysulfide dissolution, which is theoretically confirmed by density-functional theory calculations.

However, the poor cycle life and low sulfur utilization originating from the shuttling process involving lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) significantly hinder the practical application of Li-S battery. Various approaches have been introduced to retard the shuttle of LiPSs. Herein, a polar cobalt disulfide embedded in porous nitrogen doped carbon frameworks (CoS2-N-C) is synthesized from a single metal-organic framework ZIF-67. When used as a sulfur host for Li-S battery cathode, the CoS2-N-C frameworks can not only limit the dissolution of LiPSs by chemisorption, but also buffer the volume expansion during cycling. More importantly, the electrochemical reaction kinetics is greatly improved. As a result, the Li-S battery based on the S/CoS2-N-C electrode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1288 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a superior long cycle life for 500 cycles with a degradation rate as low as 0.064% per cycle at 1 C rate. Even with a high sulfur loading of 5.25 mg cm(-2), the battery still delivers a better cycle performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this contribution, a three-dimensional carbon fiber cloth (CFC) is placed between the separator and the sulfur cathode to accommodate and capture the soluble polysulfide intermediates. The cells with this interlayer show an initial discharge capacity of 6.89 mAh cm(-2), which remains substantial after 100 cycles at 1C (6.69 mAh cm(-2)). CFC interlayers provide an efficient and cost effective route for developing promising lithium-sulfur batteries with long cycle stability and good rate capability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The double-shelled nanocages can prevent the diffusion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) effectively. NiO-NiCo2O4 heterostructure is able to promote polysulfide conversion reactions. Furthermore, the thin carbon layer outside can improve the electrical conductivity during cycling. Besides, such unique double-shelled hollow nanocage architecture can also accommodate the volumetric effect of sulfur upon cycling. As a result, the prepared S/NiO-NiCo2O4@carbon (C) electrode exhibits good rate capacities and stable cycling life up to 500 cycles at 0.5 C with a very low capacity decay rate of only approximate to 0.059% per cycle.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur materials and the poor cycle stability of Li-S batteries inhibit their commercialization. Herein, porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) were fabricated by a facile electrospinning method and used as a cathode hosting sulfur for Li-S batteries. The porous structure effectively restrained soluble polysulfides from migrating due to shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur batteries. With the PCNFs as the sulfur host, the PCNFs/S cathode exhibited excellent cycling stability. An initial specific capacity of 835 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and a reversible capacity of 98.6% after 100 cycles were achieved. This outstanding performance can be ascribed to the rational design of the electrode structure, which can increase the interfacial contact and provide a large number of electrochemically active sites for polysulfide storage.

Herein, a lithium-sulfur battery interlayer was obtained by slicing the birch at different angles, following with the delignification and carbonization processes. Biochar containing lots of micropores and mesopores shows a specific surface area up to 267.7 m(2)/g. The biochar interlayer sawing along 45 degrees achieved the highest electrochemical performances. Based on this biochar interlayer, lithium-sulfur battery exhibits a high initial capacity of 979.4 mAh/g at 0.2C (1C=1650 mA/g) and retains a discharge specific capacity of 625.4 mAh/g after 200 cycles, which degrades only 0.18% per cycle. Furthermore, the hierarchical microchannel and transpiration of birch effectively adsorb polysulfide and reduce the shuttle effect, suggesting that it can be widely employed in commercial lithium sulfur battery.

In solution, lithium polysulfides undergo a series of chemical reactions and their concentration varies during cell reaction. The amount of sulfur and electrolytes in the system plays an important role in determining the cell performance. In this work, the effect of sulfur loading in cathode and the amount of electrolyte on the energy density and cycle performance of Li-S battery has been investigated. Cathodes with sulfur loading of 0.99, 2.98, and 6.80 mg_S cm(-2) were prepared. Precisely controlled amount of electrolyte was added with varied electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios of 1.67, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mu l/mg_S.

This study presents one type of new polymer material based on main-chain imidazolium-based ionic polymer (ImIP) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs); the polymer composites can serve as a precursor of CNT/NPC-300, in which close coverage and seamless junction of CNTs by N-doped porous carbon (NPC) form a 3D conductive network. CNT/NPC-300 inherits and strengthens the advantages of both high electrical conductivity from CNTs and strong PS entrapping ability from NPC. Benefiting from the improved attributes, the CNT/NPC-300-57S electrode shows much higher reversible capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability than NPC-57S and CNTs-56S. The initial discharge capacity of 1065 mA h g(-1) is achieved at 0.5 C with the capacity retention of 817 mA h g(-1) over 300 cycles. Importantly, when counter bromide anion in the composite of CNTs and ImIP is metathesized to bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide), heteroatom sulfur is cooperatively incorporated into the carbon hosts, and the surface area is increased with the promotion of micropore formation, thus further improving electrochemical performance. This provides a new method for optimizing porous properties and dopant components of the cathode materials in Li-S batteries.

However, the inherent insulation of sulfur and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide between electrodes limit the application of lithium-sulfur battery. In order to solve these problems, we focus on the design of carbon-sulfur composite structure. Herein, CS-CNTs homojunctions featured with the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in situ grown on carbon sphere (CS) is designed and synthesized by simple polymerization and heat treatment. The composites of CS with interconnected pore networks and CNTs with high conductivity not only offer a conductive framework to promote fast electron transmission, but also provide a larger space to load sulfur and effectively capture polysulfides. The CS-CNTs@S cathode shows better electrochemical performance compared with CS-CPs@S and CS@S. The first discharge specific capacity is 1053 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. After 200 cycles, the specific capacity still remains at 427 mAh g(-1).

J	Sun, K; Liu, HL; Gan, H				Sun, Ke; Liu, Helen; Gan, Hong			Cathode Loading Effect on Sulfur Utilization in Lithium-Sulfur Battery	JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY CONVERSION AND STORAGE			English	Article						lithium-sulfur battery; sulfur utilization; sulfur loading; activation	CARBON-FIBER CLOTH; ENERGY DENSITY; HIGH-CAPACITY; CHEMISTRY	The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is under intensive research in recent years due to its potential to provide higher energy density and lower cost than the current state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery technology. To meet cost target for transportation application, high-sulfur loading up to 8 mAh cm(-2) is predicted by modeling. In this work, we have investigated the sulfur loading effect on the galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling performance of Li-S cells with theoretical sulfur loading ranging from 0.5 to 7.5 mAh cm(-2). We found that the low sulfur utilization of electrodes with sulfur loading of > 3.0 mAh cm(-2) is due to their inability to deliver capacities at the voltage plateau of 2.1 V, which corresponds to the conversion of soluble Li2S4 to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S. This electrochemical conversion process recovers to deliver the expected sulfur utilization after several activation cycles for electrodes with sulfur loading up to 4.5 mAh cm(-2). For electrodes with 7.0 mAh cm(-2) loading, no sulfur utilization recovery was observed for 100 cycles. The root cause of this phenomenon is elucidated by SEM/EDS and EIS investigation. Carboninter-layer cell design and low-rate discharge activation are demonstrated to be effective mitigation methods.

Herein, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) derived in-situ carbon encapsulated transition metal oxides (Fe3O4@C) is proposed to mediate the polysulfides redox reaction, based on rapid charge transfer behavior, strong interaction with the intermediates of sulfur reduction and high electrochemical activation for polysulfides transformation. As expected, together with the hierarchical porous structure inheriting from the MIL-53 template, the Fe3O4@C incorporated in the sulfur cathode contributes to the apparently enhanced specific capacity, improved rate performance as well as super high cycling stability (extremely low capacity fading of 0.002% per cycle over 300 cycles at 1 C). This work provides a concise yet effective strategy to design a sulfur cathode for application of Li-S batteries with high rate performance and super high cycling stability.

In this work, a CNT@ZIF functionalized separator was designed to trap the dissolved polysulfides so as to suppress the shuttle effect. Benefiting from the Lewis acid-base interaction between zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8) and polysulfides, combined with the reutilizing effect of carbon nanotubes (CNT) for the trapped polysulfides operating synergistically, the functionalized separator successfully confines the polysulfides within the cathode region, thus the reversible capacity and cycling stability have been improved significantly. A high initial discharge capacity of 1588.4mA h g(-1) along with 94.8% utilization of sulfur can be achieved at 0.2 C. The capacity retention over 100 cycles increases 36.2% compared to the cell with bare separator. This facile strategy of combining separator with uniform chemisorption network is effective for achieving high-energy Li-S batteries suppressed shuttle effect.

However, the shuttle effect restricts its energy density and cycle performance, that hinders the industrialization process of Li-S battery. The introduction of catalysis in conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is an effective strategy to suppress shuttle effect. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) are attractive catalysts due to excellent electrical conductivity and rapid electron transfer efficiency, therefore, metal NPs have great potential to be introduced in Li-S battery for studying and revealing elementary conversion reactions of LiPSs. Herein, based on the strategy of accelerating conversion of LiPSs integrated with physical confinement, we designed and synthesized Pt NPs supported on carbonized microspheres (Pt/CS composites). The catalytic conversion of LiPSs from charge transfer between Pt NPs and carbon matrix, combined with the strong physical confinement by surface pores of CS, result in upgraded electrochemical properties. It is demonstrated that the resulting Pt/CS cathode exhibits improved rate performance with specific capacity of 991.9 mAh g-1 at 0.1C, and maintains a fine cycling stability. This work provides a rational and facile route to construct metal supported catalytic electrode materials for Li-S battery.

Considerable progress has been achieved in sulfur composite cathodes, but high cycling stability and discharging capacity at the expense of volumetric capacity have offset their advantages. Herein, a functional separator is presented by coating cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets and graphene on one surface of a commercial polypropylene separator. The coating layer not only suppresses the polysulfide shuttle effect through chemical affinity, but also functions as an electrocatalyst to propel catalytic conversion of intercepted polysulfides. The slurry-bladed carbon nanotubes/sulfur cathode with 90 wt% sulfur deliver high reversible capacity of 1103 mA h g(-1) and volumetric capacity of 1062 mA h cm(-3) at 0.2 C, and the freestanding carbon nanofibers/sulfur cathode provides a high discharging capacity of 1190 mA h g(-1) and volumetric capacity of 1136 mA h cm(-3) at high sulfur content of 78 wt% and sulfur loading of 10.5 mg cm(-2). The electrochemical performance is comparable with or even superior to those in the state-of-the-art carbon-based sulfur cathodes. The separator reported in this work holds great promise for the development of high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide makes it difficult to commercialize stable Li-S batteries. In this work, we designed a gelatin-polyethylenimine composite (GPC) as functional binder for Li-S batteries to improve the stability of electrode during discharge-charge process. GPC binder combines the dispersion and adhesion ability of gelatin, which keeps cathode homogeneous and stable during electrochemical reaction, and adsorption capability of PEI for polysulfide, which suppresses the "shuttling effect". The result shows that GPC used as a binder remarkably enhanced cyclic performance of Li-S battery with good capacity retention of about 100% at current density of 1C (sulfur loading 1.5mg cm(-2)) after 100 cycles. We believe that GPC would be a promising binder for highly stable Li-S batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Various nitrogen sites such as graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, pyridinic-N oxide, and Co-N-x are created during macropore formation. The sites without Co show limited polysulfide (PS) adsorption capability because nucleophilic N absorbs PS species via the weak interaction between N and Li in N-Li-S bondage. The electrophilic Co(II) in Co-N-x absorbs PS species via a strong interaction between S and Co in S-Co bond. The dual interaction of Co-N-x site with S-Co and N-Li-S bondages significantly enhances the PS adsorption. The resultant Li-S battery with the mMPC shows excellent cycleability, exhibiting a very low capacity degradation rate of 0.25 mAh g(-1) per cycle after initial 20 cycles. A rate capacity as high as 660 mAh g(-1) has been achieved after 300 cycles at 1 C charge-discharge rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Jin, L. M.; He, F.; Cai, W. L.; Huang, J.

Artificial Bifunctional Protective layer Composed of Carbon Nitride Nanosheets for High Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Lithium metal; Graphitic carbon nitride; Polysulfide shuttle effect; Protective layer	METAL ANODE; ELECTROLYTE; DEPOSITION; PROGRESS; STORAGE	Featuring high energy density and low cost, lithium sulfur batteries are regarded as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies. However, their widespread adoption is plagued by lithium dendrite growth and parasitic reactions induced by the polysulfide shuttle effect. To address these two issues simultaneously, we propose a bifunctional artificial protective layer, which is composed of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets joined together by a polyvinylidene fluoride binder. First-principles study results reveal that the coexistence of pyridinic and quaternary nitrogen in the g-C3N4 bulk phase is capable of facilitating a homogeneous Li ionic flux, thus leading to a more uniform lithium deposition. Meanwhile, side reactions are dramatically suppressed due to the elimination of the direct exposure of lithium metal in the liquid electrolyte environment. As a result, a high coulombic efficiency of 98% for over 250 h under the current density of 1 mA cm(-2) and a cycle capacity of 1 mAh cm(-2) is achieved for a Li/Cu half-cell. More remarkably, it is demonstrated that the lithium-sulfur battery with the protective layer exhibits a much prolonged cycling life (180 cycles) with a reasonable sulfur mass loading of up to 1.5 mg cm(-2).

The sulfur-activated VGCF (S-aVGCF) composites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and N-2 adsorption/desorption measurements. It is found that VGCF treated by KOH activation is longitudinally opened and presents a porous structure, and sulfur is embedded into the pores of an aVGCF network-like matrix after a melt-diffusion process. The S-aVGCF composite cathode exhibits better electrochemical reversibility, higher active material utilization and less severe polysulfide shuttle than both a pristine sulfur cathode and a S-raw VGCF composite cathode because of excellent conductivity, and the fibrous and porous structure of the aVGCF matrix.

Herein, with the aid of compositional and structural design and the use of a controllable one-pot hydrothermal method, a three-dimensional (3D) porous reduced graphene oxide@La2O3@S (r-GO@La2O3@S) composite is fabricated for use as the cathode material of Li-S batteries. In this 3D porous structure, the effective adsorption ability of the La2O3 microboards toward the polysulfides, based on strong chemical binding, and the conductivity of r-GO provide pathways to facilitate electron and ion transport while being able to accommodate the volume expansion/contraction of the sulfur cathode during the discharge-recharge processes. The r-GO@La2O3@S cathode delivers an initial reversible capacity of 1227.4 mAh g(-1) and remains 668.3 mAh g -1 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles. At a higher current of 1 C, the capacity retention remains higher than 73% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles, indicating the excellent electrochemical properties of the cathode. The exceptional performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the conductive r-GO and La2O3 microboards with the active sulfur.

Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) is considered a promising sulfur cathode with the merits of high specific capacity and long cycling stability for high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Nevertheless, the practical performances of SPAN cathodes are severely limited by the unfavorable electron accessibility due to the relatively low intrinsic conductivity and large particle size. Herein, a redox mediation strategy is proposed to accelerate the electron transfer processes in working Li-S batteries with SPAN cathodes. Specifically, a quinone-based redox mediator is introduced to provide an additional redox pathway with strengthened interfacial kinetics. The redox mediator assisted SPAN cathodes exhibit higher specific capacity, improved rate performance, reduced polarization, and longer cycling lifespan with both ether-based and carbonate-based electrolyte. This work demonstrates the feasibility of redox mediation to promote the electron accessibility for high-performance Li-S batteries with SPAN cathodes.

The local coordination environment of W atom endows the W/NG with elevated LiPSs adsorption ability and catalytic activity. LSBs equipped with W/NG modified separator manifest greatly improved electrochemical performances with high cycling stability over 1000 cycles and ultrahigh rate capability.

However, the insulation and volume change of sulfur and high solubility of polysulfides lead to the fast decay of capacity and short cycle life. In order to solve these issues, we synthesized a novel multifunctional TiO2@C composite nanofibers (TiO2@C CNs) interlayer by electrospinning technique and subsequent heat treatment. It can significantly improve the specific capacity and long cycling stability of Li-S batteries, attributed to the effective restriction of "shuttle effect" and high reutilization of trapped active materials. Using TiO2@C CNs as a multifunctional interlayer, the BP2000/sulfur cathode with a high sulfur content (70 wt %) shows an initial capacity of 852 mAh g(-1) at a high current rate of 4C and cycled over 2000 cycles with a fade rate of only 0.028% per cycle. The combination of metal oxides and carbon materials is facile and feasible way to archive high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Considering the dynamic nature of the alkyne metathesis reaction, a hydrogen-substituted graphyne (HsGY) film is successfully synthesized on a gas/liquid interface using 1,3,5-tripynylbenzene (TPB) as the precursor. The synthesized HsGY film is used as a sulfur host matrix to be applied in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). The HsGY@S electrode is prepared using S-8 as sulfur source and presents excellent electrochemical performance.

Here, we design and fabricate a "reinforced concrete" structure based on the carbon fibers (CFs) supporting graphene/carbon nanotubes (GC) matrix composites, followed by a slurry-casting process to produce the final CFs-S/GC cathode with 4.5- 5.5 mg cm-2 sulfur loading. The 3D architecture of the micro/nano-hybrid materials enhances the structural strength and builds an interconnected conductive network for efficient electrolyte infiltration and the rapid electric/ionic transport. Furthermore, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are growth on the surface of CFs by chemical vapor deposition to formation of CFs@CNFs. The CFs@CNFs-S/GC cathode enables the effective confines of polysulfides on electrochemically active sites, leading to a much-improved cycling performance. The strategy reported in this paper provides a feasible way for the construction of CFs or modified CFs skeleton in nanostructured carbon materials for high energy density Li-S batteries.

Great progress has been achieved in cathode design to deal with the intrinsic problems of sulfur cathodes, including low conductivity, the dissolution of polysulfide intermediate, and volume fluctuation. However, aiming at the practical applications of Li-S batteries, the weight percentage of sulfur in cathode materials and the overall areal sulfur loading need to be significantly increased, which inevitably complicate the process and cause heavy shuttle effect, slow redox kinetics, and more undesirable reaction pathways. Recently, rationally designing efficient mediators, as well as incorporating them into a working battery, emerges to be a promising method to construct high-energy-density Li-S batteries. The influence of mediators on Li-S batteries appears to be the enhancement in redox kinetics and the increase in reaction efficiency. In this feature article, the mechanistic understanding of redox kinetics in Li-S reactions is discussed, and then a comprehensive analysis of the recent advances in both heterogeneous and homogeneous mediator design is provided. A mediator perspective in building high-energy-density Li-S batteries is also included.

However, the practical application is limited by the intrinsic insulating nature of sulfur and severe shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide intermediates. Herein, we demonstrate a convenient self-assembly strategy for encapsulating carbon nanotubes in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon shells, to construct a nitrogen-doped tube-in-tube carbon nanostructure (NTTC) as a host material of sulfur. In this peculiar structure, the highly conductive carbon nanotube cores facilitate the electron transfer while the hollow porous structure is capable of accommodating high sulfur content of 70 wt% in the composites. Moreover, the nitrogen doping helps to alleviate the shuttle effect owing to enhanced chemisorption towards polysulfides. Benefiting from these merits, the NTTC/S composite with the high areal mass loading of similar to 2.5 mg cm(-2) presents a high reversible capacity (1346.9 mAh g(-1), at 0.05 C) and excellent rate capability (533.5 mAh g(-1) at 3C). More impressively, NTTC/S electrode exhibits good cycling stability at a high rate of 2 C corresponding to slight capacity decay of 0.055% per cycle over 500 discharge/charge cycles.

Unfortunately, the shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur batteries is an important factor that hinders their marketization inputs. In this article, we propose an in-situ extrinsic metal etching strategy to activate inert single-metal nitrides through doping methods. The construction of the functional layer on the diaphragm results in an internal electric field directed to the negative electrode between the diaphragm and the negative electrode. The construction of the internal electric field is benefit for the moving of the anions and cations, thereby reducing the dissolution of the polysulfides. Moreover, it is found that the initial capacity reaches 1421 mAh g(-1) and the utilization of sulfur reaches 84.83% at 0.1C. The initial capacity is 1280.8 mAh g(-1) , and there is 466.4 mAh g(-1) specific capacity remaining after 1400 cycles and the decay rate is 0.045% at the rate of 1C. Even at the high rate of 5C, the initial capacity is 1097.2 mAh g(-1) and the specific capacity of 379.4 mAh g(-1) remains after 800 cycles.

However, the practical implementation of Li-S batteries has been thwarted by the detrimental shuttling behavior of polysulfides, and the sluggish kinetics in electrochemical processes. Herein, a novel single atom (SA) catalyst with oversaturated Fe-N-5 coordination structure (Fe-N-5-C) is precisely synthesized by an absorption-pyrolysis strategy and introduced as an effective sulfur host material. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal synergism between atomically dispersed Fe-N-5 active sites and the unique carbon support. The results exhibit that the sulfur composite cathode built on the Fe-N-5-C can not only adsorb polysulfides via chemical interaction, but also boost the redox reaction kinetics, thus mitigating the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the robust three-dimensional nitrogen doped carbon nanofiber with large surface area, and high porosity enables strong physical confinement and fast electron/ion transfer process. Attributed to such unique features, Li-S batteries with S/Fe-N-5-C composite cathode realize outstanding cyclability and rate capability, as well as high areal capacities under raised sulfur loading, which demonstrates great potential in developing advanced Li-S batteries.

However, there is an ongoing discussion whether the cavity is accessible for sulfur. Yet no valid proof of cavity filling has been presented, mostly due to application of unsuitable high-vacuum methods for the analysis of sulfur distribution. Here we describe the distribution of sulfur in hollow carbon spheres by powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy along with results from scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen physisorption. The results of these methods lead to the conclusion that the cavity is not accessible for sulfur infiltration. Nevertheless, HCS/sulfur composite cathodes with areal sulfur loadings of 2.0 mg.cm(-2) were investigated electrochemically, showing stable cycling performance with specific capacities of about 500 mAh.g(-1) based on the mass of sulfur over 500 cycles.

The cathode composed of CeF3-doped PCNFs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and S is successfully prepared through the ball milling and heating method. The formed porous structure in the PCNFs and CNTs facilitates the construction of highly electrically conductive pathways and effectively alleviates volume changes, which can maintain the stability of the cathode structure and make them in close contact between the electrodes. Meanwhile, the intermediate polysulfide dissolved and lost in the electrolyte can also be suppressed because of the hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers and CeF3. The Li-S battery using the cathode can display excellent electrochemical properties and stable capacity retention, presenting an initial discharge capacity of 1395.0 mAh g(-1) and retaining a capacity of 901.2 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C. During the rate capability tests of battery, the discharge capacity of Li-S battery with the electrode slowed down from the discharge capacity of 1284.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C to 1038.6 mAh g(-1) at 1C and 819.3 mAh g(-1) at 2C, respectively. It is noteworthy that the battery can still endow an outstanding discharge capacity of 1269.73 mAh g(-1) with a high retention of 99.2% when the current density returns to 0.5C.

Here, we report an all-electrochem-active hybrid sulfur cathode by integrating nest-like O-defective RuO2 (RuO2-x) with sulfur to simultaneously realize decent flexibility, durability, and energy density. The mechanically robust RuO2-x with high electrical conductivity, active capacity contribution and high electrocatalytic activity is proved to be an ideal matrix to unlock high gravimetric and volumetric performances. Moreover, from jointly chemical and physical perspectives, it is confirmed that the polaron hopping-mediated dynamic interactive sites are formed in this RuO2-x/S system, which overcomes the reaction barrier and expedites Li-S chemistry. Impressively, the prototype pouch cells exhibit superb capacity retention under harsh bending conditions and harvest jointly high energy densities of 328 Wh kg(-1) and 357 Wh L-1 under lean electrolyte condition, holding great promise for achieving energy-dense flexible Li-S batteries.

Herein, a novel, low-cost, and scalable method (termed as inverse fabrication route) is proposed to directly prepare Li2S-based electrodes. This methodology uniformly anchors in situ generated Li2S nanocrystals with a controllable size of 5-10 nm on the woven carbon fibers (WCF) substrate to fabricate a spatial conductive network structure, which provides continuous high-speed pathways for electron/ion transport. Furthermore, Li2S nanocrystals are encapsulated into a nitrogen/fluorine (N/F) codoped carbon framework to directly fabricate a spatial structure of Li2S-nanocrystals @ doped-carbon/WCF (Li2S @ DC/WCF) composite cathode. N/F codoped carbon yields certain catalytic effects on the electrochemical redox reaction for lithium-sulfur batteries, and N-containing groups in carbon lead to a strong chemical interaction with Li2S/lithium polysulfides, thus improving the electrochemical reaction kinetics and suppressing the polysulfide shuttle. Hence, the as-prepared Li2S @ DC/WCF composite cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 913 mA h g(-1)at 0.2C, and the discharge capacity remains at 98% even after 200 cycles at 1C, corresponding to an average capacity decay of 0.01% cycle(-1).

The 3DOM-mC is prepared by a dual-templating method via using silica crystal as hard template, triblock copolymer EO20PO70EO20 as soft template and resol (phenol/formaldehyde) as the carbon source. The as-synthesized 3DOM-mC possesses a large BET surface area of 818.5 m(2) g(-1), ordered interconnected macropores and ordered mesopores on the macropore walls. The 3DOM-mC is then composited with sulfur to obtain the sulfur/3DOM-mC (S/3DOM-mC) hybrids by a simple solvothermal synthesis process. In Li/S batteries, the S/3DOM-mC composite shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1042 mAh g(-1), with 703 mAh g(-1) remaining after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Furthermore, at a high rate of 2.5 C, it can still deliver a high capacity of 357 mAh g(-1), with a capacity recuperability of 85% as the current back to 0.5 C. The great electrochemical performance is attributed to its unique hierarchical structure with 3D ordered interconnected macropores that can provide the rapid mass transport and ordered mesopores that can trap polysulfides via physisorption.

The polypyrrole synthesized in situ on the graphene oxide sheets is used as a carbon precursor. The micro/mesoporous strcutures of the SCNMM are created by a carbonization process followed by HF solution etching and KOH treatment. Sulfur is impregnated into the hybrid carbon nanosheets to generate S@SCNMM composites for the cathode materials in Li-S secondary batteries. The microstructures and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared samples are investigated in detail. The hybrid carbon nanosheets, which have a thickness of about 10-25 nm, high surface area of 1588 m(2) g(-1), and broad pore size distribution of 0.8-6.0 nm, are highly interconnected to form a 3D hierarchical structure. The S@SCNMM sample with the sulfur content of 74 wt% exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, including large reversible capacity, good cycling stability and coulombic efficiency, and good rate capability, which is believed to be due to the structure of hybrid carbon materials with hierarchical porous structure, which have large specific surface area and pore volume.

Moreover, they can be mass-produced (tons/year) using a novel proprietary process technology making them an attractive material for various industrial applications. One of the applicatibns is the encapsulation of sulfur, which turns them as promising conductive host materials for lithium-sulfur batteries. Therefore, we explore for the first time the electrochemical performance of industrially produced N-SWCNHs as a sulfur-encapsulating conductive material. Fabrication of lithilim-sulfur cells based on NSWCNFIS with sulfur composite could achieve a remarkable initial gravimetric capacity of 1650 mA h g(-1), namely equal to 98.5% of the theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g), with an exceptional sulfur content as high as 80% in weight. Using cyclic chronopotentiornetry and impedance spectroscopy, we also explored the dissolution mechanism of polysulfides inside the electrolyte.

Yet the polysulfide dissolution and shuttle issues cause severe performance degradation, hindering their practical use. Here, we report an in-situ solidification strategy for efficient polysulfide blocking via nucleophilic substitution reactions triggered by 2, 5-dichloro-1, 4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) in the electrolyte. Polysulfides could be covalently fixed by DCBQ in the form of solid organosulfur to enable effective immobilization of polysulfides within the cathode, contributing to high capacity-retention. Moreover, the benzoquinonyl groups of DCBQ were found able to accelerate the lithium-ion transport and promote the sulfur redox reaction kinetics. Consequently, the Li-S cell with DCBQ exhibited good electrochemical performances. This approach demonstrates a novel avenue for polysulfide blocking to boost Li-S battery performance.

J	Chung, SH; Chang, CH; Manthiram, A				Chung, Sheng-Heng; Chang, Chi-Hao; Manthiram, Arumugam			A Carbon-Cotton Cathode with Ultrahigh-Loading Capability for Statically and Dynamically Stable Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS NANO			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; high-loading electrode; high capacity; self-discharge; porous carbon; electrochemistry	SELF-DISCHARGE; ENERGY DENSITY; HIGH-CAPACITY; FIBER CLOTH; CELL; POLYSULFIDES; INTERLAYER; MEMBRANE; PROGRESS; SYSTEM	Sulfur exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 1675 mA h g(-1) via a distinct conversion reaction, which is different from the insertion reactions in commercial lithium-ion batteries. In consideration of its conversion reaction battery chemistry, a custom design for electrode materials could establish the way for attaining high-loading capability while simultaneously maintaining high electrochemical utilization and stability. In this study, this process is undertaken by introducing carbon cotton as an attractive electrode-containment material for enhancing the dynamic and static stabilities of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The carbon cotton possessing a hierarchical macro-/microporous architecture exhibits a high surface area of 805 m(2) g(-1) and high microporosity with a micropore area of 557 m(2) g(-1). The macroporous channels allow the carbon cotton to load and stabilize a high amount of active material. The abundant microporous reaction sites spread throughout the carbon cotton facilitate the redox chemistry of the high-loading/content Li-S system. As a result, the high-loading carbon-cotton cathode exhibits (i) enhanced cycle stability with a good dynamic capacity retention of 70% after 100 cycles and (ii) improved cell storage stability with a high static capacity retention of above 93% and a low time-dependent self-discharge rate of 0.12% per day after storing for a long period of 60 days. These carbon-cotton cathodes with the remarkably highest values reported so far of both sulfur loading (61.4 mg cm(-2)) and sulfur content (80 wt %) demonstrate enhanced electrochemical utilization with the highest areal, volumetric, and gravimetric capacities simultaneously.

However, despite their high capacity and energy density, there are key issues for commercialization of Li-S batteries that need to be solved, such as shuttle effect to be solved. In this study, for high-rate performance Li-S batteries, we fabricated an interlayer consisting of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) (MoS2/CNF). The in situ phase transition of 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 in the MoS2/CNF was electrochemically induced. The 1T-MoS2/CNF interlayer structure was found to effectively suppress the shuttle effect. The superior rate performance of the Li-S cell with 1T-MoS2/CNF was found to result from the interlayer structures acting as an upper current collector and a reservoir for Li-polysulfides.

The introduction of anchoring materials to adsorb Li2Sn is an effective way to overcome this problem and achieve long-term cycling stability. In this work, a systematical density functional theory study of single-atom Fe and N co-doped graphene (FeNx (x = 1, 2, 3, 4)) is conducted to elaborate the anchoring mechanism. We investigate the adsorption of Li2Sn on FeNx and study the detailed interaction and electronic structure. It is proved that there is strong interaction between FeNx and Li2Sn, which will inhibit the dissolution and diffusion of Li2Sn (n = 4, 6, 8) and is beneficial to the uniform nucleation of Li2S and Li2S2. In addition, the stability of FeNx can be improved by increasing the number of N coordination. Finally, the adsorption energy can be adjusted by doping concentration of atoms. Hence, our work reveals in detail the mechanism how FeNx improve the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. It is of guiding significance to the screening and design of anchoring materials in the future.

This composite cathode includes carbonized cotton fibers as the electron conductive skeleton, sulfide electrolyte coating on the carbon fibers as the Li-ion conductor, and elemental sulfur as the active material. The in-situ coating of sulfide electrolyte is carried out via a liquid-phase process, which results in a close contact between carbon fiber and the sulfide electrolyte. The subsequent mixing and heating treatment with elemental sulfur form a composite cathode with good electrochemical performance. In the assembled all-solid-state Li-S battery with Li6PS5Cl electrolyte and lithium metal anode, the composite cathode delivers a super high discharge capacity of 32.8 mAh.

One of the main issues is the dissolubility of intermediates, lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), of sulfur cathode. To address this issue, we report a novel composite as sulfur cathode that can highly immobilize the LiPSs and thus significantly improve the cyclic stability of Li-S battery. This composite is fabricated by successively loading S and N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan (NOCC) on graphene oxide (GO) and subsequent hydrothermal reduction, presenting a sandwich-like structure (NOCC@S-8/rGO). Electrochemical measurements indicate that the as-fabricated NOCC@S-8/rGO as cathode of Li-S battery exhibits a small capacity decay of 0.068% per cycle at 0.5C over 500 cycles anda significantly improved rate capability. Such superior cyclic stability and rate capability are attributed to the support to S species from rGO and the strong interaction of NOCC with LiPSs via Li-N bonds, as demonstrated by physical characterization and theoretical calculations.

However, the polysulfide shuttle, huge volume change of sulfur and kinetics sluggishness limit their practical applications. Here, we synthesize a hollow CoxSny modified N-doped carbon (denoted as E-CoxSny/NC) as host material of Li-S batteries through a stepwise coating-etching approach. The introduction of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and the pyrogenation of polydopamine (PDA) induce the formation of CoxSny alloy at high temperature. The novel metal-N-carbon-based composite possesses strong chemisorption and electrocatalytic conversion activity for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), which can accelerate the redox reaction kinetics and minimize the polysulfides loss. Therefore, the prepared E-CoxSny/NC/S cathode shows high specific capacity of 1006 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C, good long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 81.2% after 500 cycles at 1.0C, and superior rate capacity (similar to 778mA h g(-1) at 2.0C). Moreover, the E-CoxSny/NC/S composite displays low polarization and fast redox reaction kinetics, especially at high current density, due to the catalysis effect of CoxSny alloy for LiPSs conversion during cycling, demonstrating its great potential as advanced cathode for high performance Li-S batteries.

X-ray diffractometer, Raman spectrometer, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, pore size and surface area analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were exploited to investigate its morphology and microstructure. It was subsequently employed as a coating on pristine separator in lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery. The coating could not only decrease the interface resistance between the cathode and the separator and thus improve the reaction kinetics of the Li-S battery, but also effectively sequester the polysulfides and restrain the "shuttle effect" inside the battery. The cell with coating on separator delivered a high specific capacity of 586.6 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C, and it also exhibited good cycle stability and rate performance.

The slurry of DTT-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was coated on the surface of sulfur cathode as a shield to slice the long-chain LiPSs to short-chain ones for checking the dissolution and migration of LiPSs to lithium anode. The morphology and structure of the electrodes were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performance was tested by galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The initial discharge capacity of S-DTT-carbon nanotube paper (CNTP) electrode reached 1670 and 949 mAh/g at 0.05 and 2 C respectively with a coulombic efficiency of over 99%. The electrode maintained a reversible specific capacity of 949 mAh/g after 45 cycles at 2 C. This suggested that the DTT-doped MWCNT coating can restrain shuttle effect and improve the rate and capacity of Li-S battery. The S-DTT-CNTP electrode not only accommodates the volume expansion but also provides stable electronics and ions channels.

Adsorption experiments reveal that VPO4 has good adsorbability for polysulfides, which also has been demonstrated by ultraviolet/visible absorption spectrum. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy further indicates that there exists chemical interaction between VPO4 and polysulfides. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study provided in-depth detailed analysis of chemical interaction. Furthermore, VPO4 as a matrix of sulfur which can alleviate volume expansion of sulfur and increase the utilization of active sulfur. The cell with the S/(VPO4 + CNTs) electrode exhibits 1056.0 mAh g(-1) and 651.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C during the first and 500th cycles, which is much higher than 792.0 mAh g(-1) and 486.5 mAh g(-1) of the S/(AB+ CNTs) electrode. Even at 2 C, the discharge capacity of the S/(VPO4 + CNTs) electrode shows 566.8 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles. These results demonstrate that VPO4 as efficient matrix for sulfur and absorbent for polysulfides is beneficial for improving electrochemical performances of lithium-sulfur battery.

To expand the Li-S application, Co9S8@S nanotube composites were developed and fabricated via hydrothermal method combining with incorporating sulfur using melt-diffusion method. In comparison with pure sulfur cathode, the Co9S8@S nanotube composites cathode delivered excellent specific capacity, had remarkable rate performance and superior coulombic efficiency. The initial capacity of Co9S8@S nanotube composites cathode was 937 mAh/g and stabled at 650 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, much superior than pure S electrode. The improved electrochemical performance of Co9S8@S nanotube composites cathode was awarded to highly conductive and polar Co9S8 nanotubes. On the one hand, Co9S8 nanotubes help to form effective conductive networks which can improve the transport of electrons/lithium ion and overall electrical conductivity; on the other hand, polar Co9S8 nanotubes entrapped polysulfides through chemical adsorption to alleviate the shuttle effect. In addition, sulfur particles were well-distributed on the hollow Co9S8 nanotubes, which relieve the volume expansion of sulfur effectively. These synergistic effects were achieved by physical constraints and chemical effects of hollow Co9S8 nanotubes.

In this paper, ZIF-8 material with a large specific surface area was successfully prepared with metallic zinc as the central atom and dimethylimidazole. After sintering at 800 degrees C, the mesoporous carbon material was obtained, which increased its physical adsorption of sulfur. At the same time, titanium dioxide was coated on the mesoporous carbon material to obtain a core-shell structure with a specific surface area of up to 556.1 m(2)/g. The titanium dioxide coating well inhibits the occurrence of the shuttle effect and at the same time improves the cycle stability of the lithium-sulfur battery.

Optimizing the structural configuration, enhancing reaction kinetics of the sulfur cathode, and increasing areal sulfur loading are of great significance for promoting the commercial applications of Li-S batteries. Herein, the multifunctional polysulfide scavengers based on nitrogen, sulfur co-doped carbon cloth (DCC), which is supported by flower-like MoS2 (1T-2H) decorated with BaMn0.9Mg0.1O3 perovskite particle (PrNP) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), namely, DCC@MoS2/PrNP/CNTs, are delicately designed and synthesized. The physical confinement, chemical coupling, and catalysis conversion for active sulfur are achieved simultaneously in this polysulfide motif. Due to these merits, the as-fabricated self-supported DCC@MoS2/PrNP/CNTs/S manifests an excellent reversible areal capacity of 4.75 mAh cm(-2) with an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 5.2 mg cm(-2) at the 50th cycle. The outstanding cycling stability is obtained upon 800 cycles with a large reversible capacity of 871 mAh g(-1) and a negligible fading rate of 0.02% per cycle at a rate of 1.0 C, suggesting its promising prospects for the commercial success of high-performance Li-S batteries toward flexible electronic devices and energy storage equipment.

Herein, we prepare interconnected porous honeycomb hollow carbon spheres (IPHHCSs) using hard-templating route by increasing the concentration of template spheres and introducing cationic surfactants simultaneously. The as-obtained IPHHCSs show favorable features for ESD, such as large contacted areas between spheres, high specific surface areas (951 m2 g-1), hierarchical porous frameworks with high volume of mesopores, and rich N-doping (3.36%), achieving a lower interface-resistance between spheres, more ion-storage sites, and developed mesoporous channels for rapid ions diffusion. Thus, such a unique carbon architecture endows IPHHCSs a superior rate capability for supercapacitor and lithium-sulfur battery applications. The IPHHCSs supercapacitor's electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 295F g-1 at 1 A g-1, an outstanding rate capability (87% capacitance retention from 1 A g-1 to 20 A g-1), with a high cycling life stability (1.2% loss after 10,000 cycles). As for lithium-sulfur batteries, the IPHHCSs/S cathode with sulfur loading of 70% demonstrated an initial reversible capacity of 1160 mAh g-1 at 0.2C and an excellent rate performance with a capacity retention of 53% at 10C. More notably, IPHHCSs/S electrode could also enable a remarkable cyclic stability that possesses a reversible capacity of 285 mAh g-1 at 10C upon 1000 cycles with a low capacity degradation of 0.042% per cycle. Controllable design of interconnected porous HCSs structures could decrease interface-resistance and promote ion diffusion, which can be an effective way for developing high-rate supercapacitors and Li-S batteries.

Sulfur is abundant in nature. Carbon materials have been widely used as sulfur host materials owing to their high electrical conductivity and large surface area. As the host materials highly influence the performance of Li-S batteries, their properties should be well designed. Therefore, understanding the significance of the properties of these materials as sulfur hosts is important in the practical design of electrodes. In this study, sulfur composite cathodes were fabricated using acetylene black (AB) and active carbon (AC) to investigate the effect of the carbon host material on the performance of the Li-S batteries. AB has a higher electrical conductivity and a smaller surface area compared to AC. The sulfur composite cathode with AB shows excellent cycling and kinetic performance compared with the sulfur composite cathode with AC, even though AC has a larger surface area, indicating that the cycling and kinetic performance of the Li-S battery is dominantly affected by the electrical conductivity of the carbon host.

To meet future needs for commercial application, Li-S batteries will require both improved cycle life and high energy density. It is of critical importance to understand the fundamental mechanisms in Li-S systems to further improve the overall battery performance. Various advanced characterization techniques, over the past few years, have proven their important role in promoting the mechanism understanding for Li-S batteries. Here, the recent progress of mechanism understanding, including redox reactions, Li polysulfides dissolution, etc., in Li-S systems based on the advanced characterization techniques is reviewed. Special focus is placed on how these advanced characterization techniques are being employed and what characteristic or capability they possess. The importance of the combination of multiple characterization techniques, differences between ex situ and in situ experimental methods, as well as effects of characterization conditions in Li-S batteries are also discussed.

This paper proposes a dimension-convertible synthetic procedure based on metal-organic com-plexes. One-or two-dimensional carbon nanostructures can be developed through the different graphitization behaviors of metal-organic complexes according to the selected metal ions. These nanostructures possess vital functions from surface nitrogen functionalities and embedded metal species for a wide range of applications. These distinctive structural functions are applied to functionalize the general separator as an electrochemical barrier for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Benefiting from the polysulfide blocking function and electrocatalytic effect, the resulting separator Li-S cells exhibit high-rate capability and stable cycling performance. The remarkable performance combined with comprehensive characterization of the resulting dimension-controlled carbon nanomaterials provides new insights into the design of functional nanomaterials for energy and envi-ronmental research.

Herein, we for the first time, reported the fabrication of the core-shell structure composed of cobalt-doped carbon nano-tube (CNT) assembled polyhedron core derived from the cobalt metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOFs)@graphitized porous carbon aerogel shell as the sulfur reservoir material for Li-S batteries. The obtained sulfur cathodes exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity (939.9 mAh g(-1)- at 0.1C), outstanding areal capacity (3.35 mAh cm(-2) after 50 cycles, under a low electrolyte/8.3 mu L mg(s)(-1)), and superior cycling stability (the capacity decay rate of 0.087% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1C). The improvement in electrochemical performance could be attributed to the unique core-shell architecture: the multiple polyhedron Co-C cores not only provide a multiple-point catalytic center for LiPS conversion, but also serves as the polar material to inhibit the migrating of polysulfides by chemical interaction; More importantly, the graphitized porous carbon aerogel shell provides a fast transport channel for Li+/e(-) diffusion, and also sufficient free space for the sulfur reservoir and Li2S2 /Li2S deposition.

However, the energy storage technology based on Li-S systems, even at the single cell level, is far from commercialization. The implementation of the technology is hindered by unstable electrochemistry at the electrode-electrolyte interface, especially the cathode-electrolyte interface. In cases where the cathode builds a solid-liquid interface with the electrolyte, strong interactions between discharge intermediates of S and solvent molecules of the liquid electrolyte lead to continuous loss of active S species from the cathode to the anode through an electrochemical shuttle process, and hampers the cycling performance of the battery. By solidifying the cathode-liquid interface, the polysulfide-solvent interaction is expected to be alleviated and the Li-S electrochemistry improved.

In this study, we synthesized a novel sulfur@carbon/Co3O4 (S@C/Co3O4) composite via encapsulation of sulfur by sericin-derived carbon/Co3O4 hollow microspheres. With a sulfur content of 67.3%, the synthesized S@C/Co3O4 composite cathode delivered a high initial specific discharge capacity of 1171.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and excellent rate performance at current densities up to 4 C. It also exhibited excellent long-term cyclability over roughly 1000 cycles at 1 C and 2 C with low decay rates of 0.076% and 0.062%, respectively. The improved electrochemical performance of the S@C/Co3O4 composite mainly stems from strong polar chemisorption of polysulfides by Co3O4, the physical encapsulation sulfur by hollow spheres, and high electrical conductivity of sericin-derived carbon.

Herein, the low cost metal-organic frameworks derived nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets embedded with zinc selenide nanoparticles (ZnSe/NC nanosheets) were designed and synthesized for Li-S batteries. As the LiPSs trapping-layer, these nanocomposites provide some key benefits: (1) The nitrogen doping changes local electron distribution in the carbon nanosheets, thus the electrical conductivity is greatly improved for facilitating the transport of electrons/ions. (2) Nitrogen atoms and ZnSe nanoparticles play an important role in anchoring the LiPSs via chemical interactions. (3) The remarkable catalytic activity of ZnSe nanoparticles can accelerate the redox kinetics of LiPSs. As a result, the Li-S battery with the ZnSe/NC nanosheets modified separator exhibits ultralong lifespan over 1500 cycles with a small capacity loss of only 0.046% per cycle at 1 C, which is superior over those reported values. Furthermore, the Li-S battery with a high sulfur loading of 4.71 mg cm -2 can still maintain a high areal capacity of 4.28 mAh cm -2 after 50 cycles. This work provides a new route to the design of multifunctional low cost and high-performance separators for remarkably stable Li-S batteries.

Despite these advantages, Li-S batteries still face problems in the shuttling behavior of soluble lithium polysulfides and the electrically insulating nature of sulfur, which has motivated considerable efforts toward developing conductive nanomaterials to improve electrochemical performances. In this study, microporous N, S dual-doped carbon materials based on a basic dye compound, methylene blue, were prepared via plasma engineering and carbonization process. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that an introduction of the carbon coated separators, denoted as PPMB interlayers, in Li-S batteries resulted in reduced cell polarization and effectively alleviated the lithium polysulfide shuttling behavior, leading to a high specific capacity of 1,329 mAh g-1 and retained specific capacity of 669 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.3C. This work highlights the potential application of this heteroatom-doped carbon material in Li-S batteries, as well as the viability of dye compound-derived carbon materials in energy storage devices.

Furthermore, the optimized CNT@PC/S composite offered a large discharge specific capacity of 271.2 mAh g(-1) using ultra-fast rate of 2 C. The pore structure of CNT@PC encapsulates with the elemental sulfur, which is efficiently inhibiting the diffusion of polysulfide ions in electrolyte, resulting in the greatly improve the ability of volume changes during the charge-discharge process.

However, the shuttle effect of the dissolved sulfide polyanions and the insulating sulfur materials during charge/discharge of Li-S batteries reduce the coulombic efficiency and the cycle life of the batteries. Herein, we prepared novel Co3O4/acidified multiwall carbon nanotube (ACNT) hosting materials with a stable "bird-nest" structure, which integrates metal oxide with a conductive framework effectively. The double barrier of the "bird-nest" hosting materials suppress the shuttle effect and the carbon nanotubes provide a high electronic conductivity in the sulfur cathode. The composite Co3O4/S/ACNT cathode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1285 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 693.7 mAh g(-1) was retained after 550 cycles at 0.5 C. The cross-linked "bird-nest" structure not only encapsulates polysulfide effectively, but also promotes the transformation and utilization of polysulfides thanks to the catalytic properties of Co3O4.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LPS) limits the practical application of LSBs. Herein, we introduce an aqua-processable carbon quantum dot (CQD)-assisted resilient waterborne polyurethane (WPU) network binder for sulfur cathodes. WPU is a well-dispersed colloidal system with abundant polar groups that is suitable for regulating LPS shuttle effects. CQDs were prepared from WPU by hydrothermal treatment. The CQDs enabled facile electron/ion transport, enhanced the adsorption capability of LPS, and formed a robust network. Moreover, the chemical similarity between WPU and CQDs enabled the formation of a well-dispersed system, thereby affording optimal electrochemical performance. The WPU-CQD binder systems exhibited stable cycling performance at a high rate of 2C, with only 0.028% retention decay per cycle over 1000 cycles.

J	Zhang, SS				Zhang, Sheng S.			Does the sulfur cathode require good mixing for a liquid electrolyte lithium/sulfur cell?	ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Lithium/sulfur cell; Sulfur cathode; Liquid electrolyte; Polysulfide; Ac impedance	GRAPHITE-ELECTRODES; BATTERIES; INTERCALATION; IMPEDANCE; IONS	In order to demonstrate whether the sulfur cathode of a liquid electrolyte lithium/sulfur (Li/S) cell requires good mixing, we intentionally prepare the following three cathodes: (1) Cathode A made by spreading a sulfur/carbon disulfide solution onto a porous carbon electrode, (2) Cathode B made by laminating a porous carbon layer and a pure sulfur layer together, and (3) Cathode C made by soaking a carbon cloth into a sulfur/carbon disulfide solution and then evaporating the solvent. Without any milling treatments, the large yellow sulfur particles/crystals are visually visible in all three cathodes. Even using these cathodes without mixing of the sulfur and conducting carbon, the Li/S cells still exhibit initial discharge capacities of 1218, 1337, and 966 mAh g(-1) for Cathodes A, B, C, respectively, and maintain comparable capacity retentions as compared with the conventional Li/S cells. These results reveal that the initial mixing status of the cathode does not affect the cycling performance of Li/S cells. In this paper, we discuss our results from the viewpoint of the Li/S fundamental chemistry and suggest more effective approaches for the performance improvement. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A high-performance slurry-coated polysulfide cathode for lithium-sulfur battery	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur batteries; Preformed cathode scaffold; Polysulfide; Slurry coating; Reduced graphene oxide	REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; NITROGEN; ELECTRODES; MEMBRANE; SHUTTLE	There has been tremendous progress in enhancing the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. For example, the use of dissolved polysulfide (PS) as cathode improves sulfur (S) utilization and redox kinetics. Notably, free-standing PS cathodes have exceptional performance, but their preparation is not scalable as compared to the slurry-coating process. However, the electrochemical performance of slurry-coated PS electrodes such as Pt/graphene, Super P, metal nitrides and hierarchical porous carbon, is not satisfactory. Herein, a high-performance lithium-PS battery using inexpensive commercially available materials has been developed. Specific capacities between 1220 and 1007 mAh g(-1) were achieved at charge rates of 0.2-2.0 C, having capacity fade of lower than 0.14% per cycle over 200 cycles. At higher S loading, a practical areal capacity of > 4 mAh cm(-2) was achieved. The difference between PS and melt-diffusion S cathodes was also examined. Remarkably, the PS cathode offered 48% higher specific capacity and 26% lower capacity fade than the melt-diffused S cathode due to differences in morphology, surface area and ohmic resistance of the cathodes. This work provides a strong case towards a paradigm shift away from conventional cathode preparation approaches to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-S batteries.

In order to address the two issues, we propose a three-dimensional porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheet with embedded NixCo3-xS4 nanocrystals derived from metal organic frameworks for the durable -cathode host material in Li-S batteries. Experiments and density functional theory simulations show that the large porosity, robust N -doped carbon framework, and evenly embedded NixCo3-xS4 nanocrystals with high polarity act as strong "traps" for the immobilization of Li2Sn, which leads to an effective suppressing of the shuttle effect and promotes efficient utilization of sulfur. The NixCo3-xS4/N-doped carbon hybrid material exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1122 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 C after 100 cycles. Even at high areal sulfur loadings of 10 and 12 mg cm(-2), the hybrid cathode materials can maintain good areal capacities of 7.2 and 7.6 mAh cm(-2) after 100 cycles. The present study sheds light on the principles of the anchoring behaviors of Li2Sn species on bimetallic sulfide hybrid materials and reveals an attractive route to design the highly desirable cathode materials for Li-S batteries.

The lithium-sulfur battery is a complex energy storage system, which involves multistep electrochemical reactions, insoluble polysulfide precipitation in the cathode, soluble polysulfide transport, and self-discharge caused by chemical reactions between polysulfides and Li metal anode. These phenomena happen at different length and time-scales and are difficult to be entirely gauged by experimental techniques. In this paper, we reviewed the multiscale modeling studies on lithium-sulfur batteries: (1) the atomistic simulations were employed to seek alternative materials for mitigating the shuttle effect; (2) the growth kinetics of Li2S film and corresponding surface passivation were investigated by the interfacial model based on findings from atomistic simulations; (3) the nature of Li2S2, which is the only solid intermediate product, was revealed by the density functional theory simulation; and (4) macroscale models were developed to analyze the effect of reaction kinetics, sulfur loading, and transport properties on the cell performance. The challenge for the multiscale modeling approach is translating the microscopic information from atomistic simulations and interfacial model into the meso-/macroscale model for accurately predicting the cell performance.

In the rice-like S: PANI nanoparticles, the sulfur active material is uniformly distributed among the PANI polymer network. PANI not only provides a flexible matrix for accommodating volume changes in the active sulfur upon lithium insertion/extraction, the conducting polymer chains also provide high conductivity paths for effective charge transport. Benefiting from the electrostatic interaction between GO and PANI, the sulfur/polyaniline nanorods (designated S:PANI) can be well wrapped by the rGO nanosheets after the hydrothermal process, which can further increase the conductivity of the composite and prevent the polysulfide from dissolving upon cycling. When evaluated as a cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries, the rGO:S:PANI material exhibits a high specific capacity of 1240 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 Ag-1, and a capacity of approximately 500 mAhg(-1) (ca. 77% retention) even at a high current rate of 1.5 Ag-1.

In this work, the MoS2 grown on the 3D structured Carbon Cloth (CC@MoS2) is firstly used to fabricate the Li-S battery and the sulfur loading can be freely tuned by adjusting thermal annealing time at 200 degrees C. A two-step melt-diffusion strategy is reported for fabrication of cathodes, which involves in melting and diffusion of sulfur covered by CC@MoS2 composites instead of dissolution of sulfur in the toxic organic solvents. Compared with the non-polar carbon cloth, the CC@MoS2 composites exhibit better adsorption capacity for polysulfides due to more edge active sites, which could effectively facilitate polysulfide redox kinetics. The SEM images of the CC@MoS2 cathode after 300 cycles show that MoS2 can still maintain the nanosheet morphology. After 300 cycles at 0.5 C, the CC@MoS2 cathodes loaded with 2 mg sulfur exhibit a better reversible capacity of 698 mA h g(-1) compared with CC@MoS2 loaded with 1 mg sulfur (604 mA h g(-1)) and CC@MoS2 loaded with 4 mg sulfur (420 mA h g(-1)). This work proposes an environmentally friendly method to fabricate the lithium-sulfur battery cathode material and the sulfur loading can be freely adjusted. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, the shuttle of polysulfides and the growth of Li dendrites severely obstruct the practical applications of these batteries. In this work, a functional separator is designed and fabricated in which nano-calcium fluoride (CaF2) particles are embedded in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and bladed on a PP separator. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the adsorption energy and bond length reveal that CaF2 has a satisfying adsorption and catalytic effect on polysulfides (Li2Sn). The factional separator could accelerate homogenous Li+ flow and retard the growth of Li dendrites. In addition, an initial specific capacity of 1504 mAh g(-1) at 0.05C is achieved, and it still retains a discharge capacity of 1050 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.2C. Moreover, the capacity decay rate is only 0.06% per cycle over 420 cycles at a high current density of 0.5 C. The excellent performance could be attributed to the CaF2@rGO modified separator not only accelerating the transmission of electrons but also effectively inhibiting the shuttling of polysulfides. This work provides a better method for attaining practical applications of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Advanced cathode materials fabricated from biological carbon are becoming more popular due to their unique properties. Inspired by the fibrous structure of bamboo, herein we put forward a smart strategy to convert bamboo sticks for barbecue into uniform bamboo carbon fibers (BCF) via a simple hydrothermal treatment proceeded in alkaline solution. Then NiCl2 is used to etch the fibers through a heat treatment to achieve Ni-embedded porous graphitic carbon fibers (PGCF/Ni) for LSBs. The designed PGCF/Ni/S electrode exhibits improved electrochemical performances including high initial capacity (1198 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), prolonged cycling life (1030 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 200 cycles), and improved rate capability. The excellent properties are attributed to the synergistic effect of 3D porous graphitic carbon fibers with highly conductive Ni nanoparticles embedded.

Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to construct a three-dimensional (3D) N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) networks to support lithium polysulfides (3D-NCNT-Li2S6) as a binder-free cathode for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. The 3D N-doped CNTs networks not only provide a conductive porous 3D architecture for facilitating fast ion and electron transport but also create void spaces and porous channels for accommodating active sulfur. In addition, lithium polysulfides can be effectively confined among the networks through the chemical bond between Li and N. Owing to the synergetic effect of the physical and chemical confinement for the polysulfides dissolution, the 3D-NCNT-Li2S6 cathodes exhibit enhanced charge capacity and cyclic stability with lower polarization and faster redox reaction kinetics. With an initial discharge capacity of 924.8 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, the discharge capacity can still maintain 525.1 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, which is better than that of its counterparts.

However, the shuttle effect of the dissolved polysulfides in the electrolyte solvents has hindered the commercialization of Li-S batteries. In order to effectively suppress the shuttle effect, we design and prepare a bybrid graphene album structure as an efficient polysulfides-trapped host for Li-S battery. In this composite, the graphene album structure is stacked by graphene layer by layer through a bottom-up assembly, which provides a hierarchical porous structure, easy mass transport and excellent conductivity for the cathode host of Li-S batteries. The uniform g-C3N4 layer was in-situ generated on each graphene by hydrothermal treatment and heat polycondensation. The orderly bybrid graphene album (coded as g-C3N4@n-G) achieves the two-dimensional surface adsorption interaction for imobilizing soluble polysulfides, and the multilayer barriers also effectively prevent the escape of polysulfides to enhance the long cycling stability of Li-S batteries. As a result, an extremely low capacity decay of 0.028% cycle(-1) and a high initial capacity of 1252 mA h g(-1) have been achieved at 0.2 C. Furthermore, this kind of unique design and preparation method for hybrid graphene album also opens an opportunity for the construction of other album-like graphene-based hybrids.

The carbon fibers were thermal treated with sublimed sulfur to form S/MhMpCFs composite, which was used as cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. Electrochemical study shows that the S/MhMpCFs cathode material provides a maximum capacity of 815 mA h/g after several cycles of activation, and the capacity retains 715 mA h/g after 70 cycles, corresponding to a retention of 88%. The electrochemical property of the S/MhMpCFs composite is much superior than the S-incorporated solid carbon fibers prepared from electrospinning of single PAN. The mechanism of the enhanced electrochemical property of the S/MhMpCFs composite is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries, attracting extensive attentions, are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage system. However, Li-S batteries are facing big challenges, owing to the fast capacity degradation, low Coulombic efficiency and poor rate capabilities. By adopting a dual confinement strategy, we successfully synthesized homogenous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coated multi-chambered micro/mesoporous carbon nanocube encapsulated sulfur (P@CNC-S) composites. Sulfur is impregnated in individual interconnected multi-chambered micro/mesoporous carbon nanocubes, which act as the physical confinement and multilayered reservoirs for soluble lithium polysulfides. The PEDOT conductive polymer provides chemical bondings to soluble lithium polysulfides. When applied as cathodes in Li-S batteries, the P@CNC-S composites exhibited superior performances, including high specific capacities, long cycle life and outstanding high rate capabilities. Ex-situ TEM analysis confirmed the successful confinement of the dissolution of lithium polysulfides and volume expansion of the discharged product (Li2S), which could contribute to the high Coulombic efficiency and excellent cyclabilities.

Polar materials can improve the cycling stability owing to their inherent strong chemical interaction with polysulfides. Herein, novel rutile TiO2 mesocrystals (RTMs) are employed as the host for sulfur in Li-S batteries; the RTMs display a stable cycling performance with a capacity retention of 64% and a small average capacity decay rate of 0.12% per cycle over 300 cycles at 1 C rate. The good electrochemical properties are attributed to the interior ordered nanopores of the RTMs, which can effectively limit the dissolution of polysulfides, and the ultrafine nanowires in RTMs, which shorten the path for lithium-ion transport effectively.

Here we introduce an easy-to-form composite flexible film of CNT/S-GO with no current collector. The composite film is fabricated by a simple process that is coating slurry on the surface of hydrophobic sapphire. This composite film exhibits excellent flexibility; the electrochemical measurement results show that the modified membrane exhibits an initial discharge specific capacity of 1050 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.1 C. In addition, at 0.5 C, the specific capacity remains around 800 mAh center dot g(-1), and after 200 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 82.4%.

The construction of interlayer is an effective strategy to obstruct the diffusion of LiPS. However, the simplex physical block or chemical absorption of monotonous interlayer is difficult to reuse sulfur species, reduce impedance and restrain self-discharge of the Li-S battery simultaneously. In this study, a multicomponent sandwich-type interlayer was integrated by vanadium disulfide and carbon nanotubes composite (VS2/CNT), carbon nanofibers (CNF) substrate and graphene coating layer. The VS2/CNT presented strong affinity towards LiPS and effectively restrained the self-discharge of Li-S batteries. The CNF substrate as supporting framework increased the wettability of electrolyte and reduced the diffusion impedance of lithium ion. The graphene coating layer acting as the second collector effectively recovered the inactivated sulfur species. The multiple components of VS2/CNT adsorbent, CNF substrate and graphene coating layer exhibited favorable synergetic effects to suppress the LiPS shuttling and self-discharge of Li-S batteries. Besides, this interlayer endowed Li-S batteries with boosted redox kinetics and outstanding rate performance. The specific capacities at 0.1, 1 and 10 C were 1525, 834 and 621 mAh g(-1), respectively. More importantly, the Li-S batteries with this multicomponent interlayer performed a high residual capacity of 605 mAh g(-1) after 1145 cycles at 1 C. Even at a high sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm(-2), the cell still had high capacity of 1150 mAh g(-1) and 750 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 0.3 C, respectively. The synergetic effects of multicomponent sandwich-type composite interlayer provided a new strategy for ultra-small self-discharge and stable of Li-S batteries.

Conventional lithium-sulfur batteries easily dissolve free polysulfides, which causes a long-term stability issue; therefore, modified separators and polysulfide absorbents are necessary. In this work, sulfur atoms form covalent bonds with aromatic rings of the polyaniline backbone, and so no free polysulfides from the novel cathode exist, as confirmed by XRD and DSC. From CV analysis, the S@h-P only exhibits lower-order polysulfide on the polymer backbone, which affects the charge-discharge profile during the cell test. S@h-P exhibits a satisfactory cyclic stability of 88% capacity retention after 200 cycles, and it offers the excellent rate performance of 55% capacity preservation at the current density of 10 A g(-1) compared to 0.1 A g(-1). Most interestingly, this polymeric cathode can function in a carbonated system, whereas conventional lithium-sulfur batteries can not. Accordingly, the novel S@h-P cathode can be employed to fabricate ultra-stable and high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries for practical application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the power density, especially in prototype cells, is an often neglected parameter being crucial for future application sectors. In this work, the cathode is redesigned by introducing a scalable, nontoxic, and homogeneous sulfur impregnation process for freestanding carbon scaffolds and tailorable sulfur areal loading. This novel sulfur transfer melt infiltration is exemplarily applied to process carbon nanotube (CNT)-based Li-S cathode structures, but as a generic and scalable methodology is highly versatile. We demonstrate the development for CNT Buckypaper (BP) and CNT powder-based dry transfer electrodes (DryFilm) as cathode host structures with the highly polysulfide (PS) solvating electrolyte system DME/DOL. In order to evaluate the practicability for high power application, the redesigned CNT BP cathode system with varying sulfur contents is employed in multi-layered pouch cell format with 4 mu Lmg s(-1) for reduced electrolyte conditions. Additionally, first pouch cells with circular perforated aluminum current collector enable 80% weight savings of passive cathode material without compromising cell performance for free-standing thin-film cathodes. This study is an important step towards the development of lightweight Li-S cells for high power applications, such as drones or high altitude satellites.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) in the electrolyte seriously hinders the development of lithium-sulfur batteries. W-doped V2O5 (W-V2O5) is prepared by a hydrothermal method, which greatly improves the LiPS adsorption ability of V2O5. The W-V2O5 powder can discolor the LiPS solution in 1 min. Then, W-V2O5 is combined with a graphene/carbon nanotube composite (G/CNT) with good conductivity to modify the separator. As a result, the W-V2O5-G/CNT-coated separator allows the sulfur cathode to reach a high initial discharge capacity of 1200 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a reversible capacity of 815 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, and leads to an excellent rate ability (up to 2 C rate) and a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5%. This provides a new direction for designing efficient LiPS catalysts.

In this study, novel conductive sulfur-rich copolymer/sulfur cathode materials, cp(S-g-PANI)/S (SPAS), are developed by grafting conductive polymer segments onto copolymer backbones to improve cell electrical conductivity and enhance lithium diffusion. In a Li/S cell, newly obtained composites deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1151 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) at a current density of 0.1C. Compared to composites lacking conductive polymer segments in the copolymer backbone, such as cp(S-AS)/S (SAS), SPAS provide better rate performance when current density is increased from 0.1C to 5C and exhibit good cycling stability at 0.5C. High capacity and cycling stability of SPAS as lithium-sulfur battery cathodes are ascribed to a synergetic effect between sufur-rich copolymer and conductive PANI. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, severe shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates, poor conductivity of S and large volume change during cycling cause fast capacity fading and poor cycle performance. Herein, we demonstrate S nanodots impregnated microporous carbon encapsulated conductive mesoporous vanadium nitride nanowires (S/MVN@C NWs) as high-performance S cathode materials for Li-S batteries. The S nanodots with the size of 2-5 nm are impregnated into the mesopores of MVN@C NWs and further encapsulated with microporous carbon. During cycling, the polysulfides intermediates are strongly chemical anchored by the conductive MVN NWs and further physically trapped by microporous carbon coating within the cathode. The freestanding and binder-free cathode comprising intertwining and interpenetrating S/MVN@C NWs demonstrates highly mechanical flexibility, which deliver a long cycle life of 636 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C (1650 mA g(-1)) and high rate performance with a capacity of 543 mAh g(-1) at 10 C. Even at a high areal mass loading of 9.7 mg cm(-2), a large and stable capacity of 7.1 mAh cm(-2) is achieved. The strategy combining microporous carbon coating with high conducting mesoporous metal nitrides opens a feasible route to design large-capacity and high-stability S-based cathodes for Li-S batteries.

A proof-of-concept lithium/sulfur liquid battery with exceptionally high capacity density	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium/sulfur battery; Sulfur cathode; Polysulfide; Li anode; Cycle life	SULFUR BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; GEL ELECTROLYTE; CYCLE PROPERTY; CATHODE; IMPROVEMENT; COMPOSITES	In this communication, we disclose a proof-of-concept lithium/sulfur liquid battery that has exceptionally high capacity density. In such a battery, the cathode consists of a highly porous carbon cloth (CC) as the cathode current collector and a porous sulfur paper as the source of active material. In the first discharge, sulfur is reduced on the CC surface into high order lithium polysulfide (PS), which dissolves into liquid electrolyte and serves as the catholyte of the so-called "Li/S liquid battery". By adopting a LiNO3-contained electrolyte to protect Li anode, the Li/S liquid cell is shown to cycle reversibly between 1.7 V and 2.8 V with an initial capacity of 778 mAh g(-1) S. corresponding to a capacity density of 10.1 mAh cm(-2) CC, which could be the highest capacity density among the rechargeable Li/S batteries reported ever.

Herein, a simple strategy is demonstrated to reduce the dissolution of LPS by graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (GCN) supported by a gas diffusion layer (GDL), which consists of high nitrogen content, acts as polar sites for LPS adsorption. The partially exfoliated multi-walled carbon nanotube is used as a sulfur host (PECNT/S), which accommodates the high amount of sulfur loading due to its high specific surface area and pore volume. PECNT/S/GCN-GDL cathode remarkably exhibits excellent cyclic stability at 1C with 92.2% of initial capacity retention even after 500 cycles due to the strong trapping of LPS by chemisorption on GCN while the electrically conducting GDL ropes the electron conduction as well as electrolyte and Li+ ion diffusion. Dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique further provides the understanding of confinement of LPS on the resultant PECNT/S/GCN-GDL electrode during charge-discharge processes. In addition, the importance of the upper potential limits has been studied in this work. Our study thus addresses many challenges of the Li-S batteries by the use of carbon-based nanomaterials.

Carbon aerogel (CA) is synthesized through phenol-formaldehyde reaction with a low catalyst concentration and carbonization under high temperature, and loaded with sulfur via chemical deposition and heat treatment. The physical properties of the resulting CA and the electro-chemical performances of the resulting CA-S are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller characterization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic discharge/charge test, with a comparison of a common carbon material, acetylene black (AB), and sulfur loaded in AB (AB-S). It is found that the CA is micropore-rich with micropore volume over 66% of total pore volume, and the CA-S exhibits significantly improved cyclic stability compared with AB-S. The improved performance of CA-S is attributed to the confinement of the micropores in CA to small sulfur allotropes and corresponding lithium sulfides. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, Li-S batteries suffer from rapid capacity decay owing to the shuttle effect of the intermediate polysulfides. To tackle this issue, functional separators with the ability to absorb polysulfides play a vital role to block them from passing through the separator. Herein, an ultrathin and lightweight layer of graphene oxide (GO) loaded with Co phthalocyanine (CoPc) is fabricated on a polypropylene (PP) separator. The thickness of CoPc@GO is about 200 nm with a low areal mass of 22 mu g cm(-2). CoPc is uniformly dispersed on GO sheets through pi-pi interactions, which inhibits the shuttle effect and facilitates the conversion of the intermediate polysulfides. In consequence, the battery with a CoPc@GO-PP separator exhibits good cycling stability with a low-capacity decay rate of 0.076% per cycle at 1 C over 400 cycles and a high specific capacity of 919 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.5 C.

Nevertheless, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides has hindered the development of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a novel zirconium-based metal-organic frame-work-801 film on carbon cloth was developed as a versatile interlayer for lithium-sulfur batteries. This interlayer has a hierarchical porous structure, suitable for the immobilization of lithium polysulfides and accommodating volume expansion on cycling. Moreover, the MOF-801 material is capable of strongly adsorbing lithium polysulfides and promoting their catalytic conversion, which can be enhanced by the abundant active sites provided by the continuous structure of the MOF-801 films. Based on the above advantages, the lithium-sulfur battery, with the proposed interlayer, delivers an initial discharge capacity of 927 mAh.g(-1) at 1 C with an extremely low decay rate of 0.04% over 500 cycles. Additionally, a high area capacity of 4.3 mAh.cm(-2) can be achieved under increased S loading.

Constructing sulfur hosts with both excellent conductivity and efficient polysulfides immobilization is critical to the successful implementation of Li-S batteries. Herein, mesoporous molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) with interconnected structures is readily designed as sulfur hosts to resolve the low conductivity and polysulfides dissolution issues. The specific surface area and the conductivity of the mesoporous Mo2N are verified to be 121 m(2) g(-1) and 1 x 10(5)S m(-1), respectively. Along with its high polarity enabling the chemisorption of poly sulfides, the as-obtained mesoporous Mo2N is promising as sulfur host. The polysulfides dissolution is efficiently suppressed owing to the fruitful nanospaces in the mesoporous Mo2N that offer more exposed polar interfaces for intensive chemical affinity/adsorption with polysulfides. Encouragingly, the as-prepared mesoporous, conductive and polar Mo2N with sulfur delivers superior capacity of 995 mA h g(-1), long cycle stability (91.9% capacity retention after 100 cycles), superior to those of Nonporous-Mo2N/S and Mesoporous-MoO3/S. Our results reveal that vivid engineering of metal nitrides via creating nanopores is promising for pursuing high-performance Li-S batteries.

Four sulfur electrodes covered with composite films made of carbon (BP2000), nano-Al2O3 and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) with different exposure are prepared and tested in lithium-sulfur batteries. The results display that both the capacity retention and coulombic efficiency are improved with the increase of surface coverage percentage among which the cell with the completely sealed sulfur electrode exhibits the best cycle performance. The discharge capacity of the sealed sulfur electrode is ca. 800 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 2 C with capacity retention over 77%. The ex-situ field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Ultraviolet Visible spectroscopy (UV) and nitrogen sorption measurements reveal that the sealed structure with narrow and irregular interstitials effectively suppresses the diffusion of soluble polysulfides out of the embraced environment with virtually no effect on lithium ion conduction. The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of the sealed structure for achieving robust electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a one-step hydrothermal method was used to prepare cerium dioxide and metal organic framework composites to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Polar cerium dioxide has a strong affinity to polysulfides. Experiments further confirmed that CeO2 has a positive effect on the battery performance. UV-Vis tests were performed on the composites. After standing for 1 h, Zn@NPC-CeO2-2 showed the best adsorption of polysulfides. In addition, the specific discharge capacity of the battery was 569.3 mA h/g with 88% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 2 C. The results indicate that the addition of appropriate amounts of rare earth metal oxides can effectively improve the reaction kinetics of the battery and also provide a new idea for improving the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we propose a self-template and organic solvent-free approach to synthesize nanosheets of monoclinic ZIF-8 at room temperature from which 2D-HPC nanosheets (ZIF-8 nanosheets carbon denoted as ZIF-8-NS-C) are derived to be an efficient sulfur immobilizer for Li-S batteries for the first time. The anisotropic nanosheets are believed to relate to the symmetry of the monoclinic structure. The 2D ZIF-8-NS-C nanosheets with embedded hierarchical pores construct an effective conductive network through "plane-to-plane" modes to endow superior electron transfer and fast electro-chemical kinetics. Moreover, the nitrogen-rich feature of ZIF-8-NS-C can increase the affinity/interaction of carbon host with lithium polysulfides, favoring the cyclic performance. The sulfur/ZIF-8-NS-C (S/ZIF-8-NS-C) cathode shows a superior rate capability with high capacities of 1226 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and 785 mA h g(-1) at 2 C, and a sustainable cycling stability with a capacity attenuation of 0.12% per cycle at proposed here pioneers the controllable design of MOF-based structures to inspire the derived porous materials for energy storage applications.

In this paper, cross-linked non-porous carbon nanofibers (CNF) and mesoporous hydroxylated carbon nanofibers (m-HCNF) are prepared and comparatively utilized as sulfur-loading matrices to improve the lithiation-delithiation reversibility between molecular S-8 and metallic lithium. When model cells are assembled at a constant dosage of electrolyte (30 mL) per gram of sulfur, at open-circuit voltage the DL value of a lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cathode can be estimated according to the S-8 concentration therein: 3.51 x 10(-1)5 cm(2) s(-1) for the low sulfur-loading cathode S/CNF (47.0 wt%); 4.21 x 10(-15) cm(2) S-1 for the high sulfur-loading electrode S/m-HCNF (similar to 62.0 wt%). At 0.5 C the initial Coulombic efficiency of S/m-HCNF (96.9%) is higher than that of S/CNF (88.8%), and thereafter the better cycling stability and rate performance of the former coincide well with the varying D-Li values. In a word, these indicate an enhanced lithiation-delithiation reversibility of composite S/mHCNF for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The as-synthesised CP@TiO2 membrane is constructed of interlaced circuitous carbon fibers and TiO2 nanoparticles distributed on/in the void among the carbon fibers. The CP@TiO2-S membrane retains the robust and flexible structure of the CP membrane after infiltrating the sulfur, and the sulfur particles are homogeneously distributed within the CP@TiO2. As a free-standing cathode, the CP@TiO2-S membrane exhibits superior electrochemical performance than the CP-S membrane, displaying a reversible discharge capacity of 850 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C and a specific capacity of 660 mAh g(-1) at 5C. The superior electrochemical performance of the CP@TiO2-S membrane is ascribed to the synergetic effect between the interlaced carbon fibers of the CP membrane, which provides electronic conduction pathways and works as mechanical support, and the TiO2 nanoparticles with relatively high surface area and pore volume, which could physically/chemically trap polysulfides. The results indicate that the CP@TiO2 membrane owns potential suitability for efficient, free-standing, and high-performance batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To address this issue, rational design of high-efficiency sulfur host is increasingly demanded to accelerate the polysulfides conversion during charge/discharge process. Herein, we propose a macro-mesoporous sulfur host (Co@NC), which comprises highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles embedding in N-doped ultrathin carbon nanosheets. Co@NC is simply synthesized via a carbon nitride-derived pyrolysis approach. Owing to the highly conductive graphene-like matrix and well defined porous structure, the designed multifunctional Co@NC host enables rapid electron/ion transport, electrolyte penetration and effective sulfur trapping. More significantly, N heteroatoms and homogeneous Co nanocatalysts in the graphitic carbon nanosheets could serve as chemisorption sites as well as electrocatalytic centers for sulfur species. These Co-N active sites can synergistically facilitate the redox conversion kinetics and mitigate the shuttling of polysulfides, thus leading to improved electrochemical cycling performance of Li-S batteries. As a consequence, the S/Co@NC cathode demonstrates high initial specific capacity (1505 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C) and excellent cycling stability at 1 C over 300 cycles, giving rise to a capacity retention of 91.7% and an average capacity decline of 0.03% cycle(-1).

In this study, we designed a new cathode material comprising MoSe2/graphene to selectively adsorb polysulfides on the selenium edges and thus to mitigate their dissolution. More specifically, few layered MoSe2 was first grown on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) using the chemical vapor deposition method and then infiltrated with sulfur as the cathode for LSBs. An initial capacity of 1028 mA h g(-1) was achieved for S/MoSe2/N-rGO at 0.2 C, higher than 981 and 405.1 mA h g(-1) for pure graphene and sulfur, respectively, along with enhanced cycling durability and rate capability. Moreover, the density functional theory simulation, in addition to the experimental adsorption test, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, and transmission electron microscopy technique, reveals the dual roles that MoSe2 plays in improving the performance of LSBs by functioning as the binding sites for lithium polysulfides and as the platform that enables fast Li-ion diffusion by reducing its diffusion barrier. The reported finding suggests that the transition metal selenides could be an efficient alternative material as the cathode for LSBs.

The synthesized composite possessed high sulfur utilization, high Coulombic efficiency, and excellent cycling stability with the property of flexibility, essential to the development of flexible batteries. The capacity retentions of the SVF cell were 903 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles at 1 C and 600 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 2 C. At a high rate of 4 C, the SVF composite showed reasonable capacity retention. The superior performance of SVF composite was attributed to the highly porous structure, which effectively improved the wettability, accessibility, and absorption of electrolyte to facilitate rapid ion transfer in the cell. Vapor-grown carbon fibers embedded inside SVF as a carbon material notably enhanced the electrical conductivity of the cell, guaranteeing the electrochemical performance at high C-rates. The freestanding porous SVF fiber composite is a promising cathode material for advanced flexible lithium sulfur batteries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the shuttle effect caused by polysulfide dissolution and migration, and the destruction of cathode particles due to large volume expansion during lithiation, are the key challenges. Here, the novel graphene oxide (GO) wrapping sulfur-MnO2 (S/MnO2/GO) nanocomposite is prepared with improved rate capability and cyclic performance. The inner layer is the protective layer of MnO2 shell, which accommodates the volume expansion of sulfur and minimizes polysulfides dissolution. The outer layer of fabricated graphene oxide is the stable layer, which gives further protection in suppressing the polysulfides dissolution in case the MnO2 shells crack. The cell with S/MnO2/GO electrode delivers 1378 mAh g(-1) initial discharge capacity at the current density of 2 C and remains 818 mAh g(-1) over 1000 cycles, which exhibits the very low fading rate of 0.04 % per cycle. Moreover, the S/MnO2/GO nanocomposites can be easily fabricated with our method.

The NNH/PC/S composite prepared by a mesh-like NNH layer coating in situ on the surface of porous carbon/sulfur composite exhibits an excellent electro-chemical performance. The discharge specific capacity is up to 1203.5 mAh g(-1) for the initial cycle at 0. 5 C and maintains 521.3 mAh g(-1) after 700 cycles. As the current rate is as high as 5 C, the battery with NNH/PC/S cathode still guarantees a sufficient output in specific capacity of 583.9 mA h g(-1). Besides the better conductivity and the accommodation for sulfur from the NNR-derived porous carbon, the coating of the mesh-like NNH layer also plays a critical role in improving the cycling properties by providing a strong adsorption by Ni-S bond and more active sites for redox reactions, and thus suppressing the dissolution of polysulfides.

In this way, the host provides efficient physical and/or chemical effects to trap the dissolved polysulfides and enhance the conductivity of the sulfur cathode. Nickel-iron on carbon fiber paper (Ni-Fe/CP) with a unique hierarchical structure was synthesized by hydrothermal method at 90 degrees C and used as an efficient host and conductivity enhancer for sulfur cathodes. The electrode with Ni-Fe/CP current collector gives an initial specific capacity of 1041 mA h g(-1), which is higher than that of the CP current collector without modification (901 mA h g(-1)). The results prove that the addition of Ni-Fe composites into CP contributes to the improvement of conductivity of the sulfur cathode and the specific capacity of LSB.

In terms of transition-metal-based candidates, in situ evolution of electrocatalysts in the course of an electrochemical process has been acknowledged; nevertheless, consensus has not yet been reached on their real functional states as well as catalytic mechanisms. Herein, we report an all-chemical vapor deposition design of the defective vanadium diselenide (VSe2)-vertical graphene (VG) heterostructure on carbon cloth (CC) targeting a high-performance sulfur host. The electrochemistry induces the sulfurization of VSe2 to VS2 at Se vacancy sites, which propels the adsorption and conversion of LiPSs. Accordingly, the VSe2-VG@CC/S electrode harvests an excellent cycling stability at 5.0 C with a capacity decay of only 0.03990 per cycle over 800 cycles, accompanied by a high areal capacity of 4.9 mAh cm(-2) under an elevated sulfur loading of 9.6 mg cm(-2). Theoretical simulation combined with operando characterizations reveals the key role played by the Se vacancy with respect to the electrocatalyst evolution and LiPS regulation. This work offers insight into the rational design of heterostructure sulfur hosts throughout defect engineering.

In this study, molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanoparticles are shown to play a definitive electrocatalytic role for the sulfur cathode working under lean electrolyte conditions featuring a low electrolyte/active material ratio: the overpotentials for the charging and discharging reactions are greatly decreased. As a result, sulfur electrodes containing MoP nanoparticles show faster kinetics and more reversible conversion of sulfur species, leading to improvements in charging/discharging voltage profiles, capacity, rate performance, and cycling stability. Taking advantage of the electrocatalytic properties of MoP, high-performance sulfur electrodes were successfully realized that are steadily cyclable at a high areal capacity of 5.0 mAh cm(-2) with a challenging electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 4 mu L(E)mg(-1) S.

Combining desulfurization and fabrication of cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) can solve this issue with a double benefit. Herein, the amino-functionalized lotus root-like carbon nanofibers (NH2-PLCNFs) are prepared by the amination of electrospinning carbon nanofibers under dielectric barrier discharge plasma. Selective catalytic oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur (S) is achieved over the metal-free NH2-PLCNFs catalyst, and the obtained composite S@NH2-PLCNFs is further used as cathode in LSBs. NH2-PLCNFs enable efficient desulfurization (removal capacity as high as 3.46 g H2S g(-1) catalyst) and strongly covalent stabilization of S on modified carbon nanofibers. LSBs equipped with S@NH2-PLCNFs deliver a high specific capacity of 705.8 mA h g(-1) at 1 C after 1000 cycles based on the spatial confinement and the covalent stabilization of electroactive materials on amino-functionalized porous carbon matrix. It is revealed that S@NH2-PLCNFs obtained by this kind of chemical vapor deposition leads to a more homogeneous S distribution and superior electrochemical performance to the sample S/NH2-PLCNF-M prepared by the traditional molten infusion. This work opens a new avenue for the combination of environment protection and energy storage.

It is necessary to prepare an ultralight sulfur host with strong polysulfide adsorption/blocking ability. Herein, the polydopamine coated ochroma lagopus carbon (A-PDA@OLC) with super-high specific surface area is exploited as sulfur host for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. The cathode with 60.13 wt % sulfur content (2 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading) delivered the higher initial capacity of 1294.27 mA h g(-1) and excellent reversible capacity (959.13 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C after 200 cycles). Moreover, when the sulfur content was increased to 82.30 wt% (4 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading), the A-PDA@OLC@S cathode exhibits the higher reversible capacity of 1258 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and a prolonged cycle life (723 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles). The prepared PDA coated natural ultralight biochar are proven to be an effective strategy for the encapsulation and adsorption of lithium polysulfides(LiPSs), which demonstrates enhanced electrochemical performance for high-sulfur-loading Li-S batteries.

However, how to construct hybrid nanomaterials with reasonable structure and composition remains a challenge. Herein, the Mo2C nanoparticles grown on the surface of hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (HMCS@Mo2C) are synthesized as an effective sulfur host for Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading. In this hybrid structure, the HMCS can guarantee high sulfur loading, high-speed electron/ion transport, and sufficient buffer for volume change, and the Mo2C nanoparticles as effective catalysts significantly accelerate the conversion of polysulfides. Consequently, the as-prepared HMCS@Mo2C-S cathode demonstrates superb cyclic stability with a capacity decay rate of 0.065% for 500 cycles at 1 C. Impressively, HMCS@Mo2C-S cathode with high areal sulfur loading of 5.4 mg cm-2 can deliver a high specific capacity of 451.2 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. In addition, the preparation of HMCS@Mo2C is simple, feasible, and low cost. It is hoped that this work will provide new insight into the rational design of sulfur host materials integrating reasonable structure with an effective catalyst for Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading.

Herein, a facile simultaneous activation/carbonization with inexpensive FeCl3 and ZnCl2 as activators is employed to prepare sucrose derived porous carbon at low temperature of 600 degrees C. The as-prepared carbon materials not only have partial graphitization due to the FeCl3 catalysis, but also show abundant hierarchical porous structure with high specific surface area of 2104 m(2) g(-1) and large pore volume of 1.29 cm(3) g(-1), whilst obtaining a high yield of about 30 wt%. When used to encapsulate sulfur, the abundant porous structure is conductive to immobilizing polysulfides and buffering volume effect during charge/discharge. Owing to these structure merits and good electrical conductivity, the corresponding porous carbon/sulfur cathode with a sulfur content of 53 wt% delivers high first discharge capacity of 811 mAh g-1 at 0.2C. Even with 75 wt% sulfur, the reversible capacity of 446 mAh g-1 are also obtained after 200 cycles at 0.2C. Especially, a durable long life of 1000 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.035% per cycle can be achieved at 1C when the sulfur content is 45 wt %. This work provides a scientific foundation for preparing high-performance porous carbon applied in energy related storage/conversion.

The grand challenges of lithium-sulfur batteries are sulfur immobilization and improving electrical conductivity of cathode composite. The carbon-sulfur (C-S) composites and the polar materials (Ni(OH)(2), TiO2, MnO2, TiS2, Co9S8, etc) integration have been proven to be two of the most effective routes to achieving good Li-S battery performance. However, each strategy has drawbacks: the C-S composites have low volume density and the polar materials are often lack of electrical conductivity. Therefore, the hybridization of carbon and polar materials shall provide synergistic effects achieving ideal sulfur cathode. Herein, a hybrid material with carbon-coated NiS nanoparticles grown on graphene sheets was synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction followed by two steps of annealing. The obtained composite has a well-balanced ratio between graphene and NiS. An optimized energy density was demonstrated in lithium-sulfur cells.

In our work, four kinds of biomass carbon materials derived from mushroom have been synthesized by a facile activation method using H3PO4, K2CO3, KOH and ZnCl2 as activators and the correlation between micromorphology characteristics and electrochemical properties in these biomass carbon materials have been systematically investigated. The electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries is highly dependent on pore size, pore volume and surface area of activated carbon matrixes. The H3PO4-, K2CO3-, KOH- and ZnCl2- activated carbon materials exhibit the fluffy, dense, anomalous and molten morphologies, respectively, which induce the initial discharge capacities of 1357, 943, 1013 and 860 mAh g(-1) in their S/C composites; and their capacity retentions at 0.1C are 54%, 37%, 38% and 35% after experiencing 100 cycles, respectively. These may be attributed to the combination effects of surface area and pore size/volume in their carbon matrixes. Our study show that activator can effectively tailor pore size, pore volume and surface area of biomass carbon host materials and thus improve electrochemical performance of S/C composites for lithium sulfur batteries.

However, the low electronic conductivity of sulfur and the high solubility of intermediates in electrolyte are the challenges for its wide applications. To address these issues, we report a novel architecture, a coral-like reduced graphene oxide/tungsten sulfide hybrid, as host for sulfur cathode. This hybrid is fabricated by in-situ growing tungsten sulfide nanoflakes on a reduced graphene oxide aerogel, providing not only a 3D network for electronic conductivity, but also a large surface area to entrap chemically the intermediates. As expected, the sulfur cathode based on this hybrid support exhibits a high discharge capacity of 1531 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C and a high sulfur utilization of 91.6%. Even at a high rate of 1 C, an initial specific capacity of 883 mAh g(-1) and an extremely low capacity-decay rate of 0.086% per cycle are still achieved. The ability of the resulting hybrid to entrap the intermediates is confirmed by combining physical characterization and theoretical calculations.

However, the areal sulfur loading and rate performance in most Li-S batteries do not suffice practical applications due to severe polysulfides shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics. Here, we report a novel sulfur host comprising planted carbon nanotubes with embedded cobalt on a nitrogen doped hollow MXene scaffold. In this hierarchical structure, the macropores in the hollow scaffold facilitate mass transports and accommodate volumetric changes upon electrochemical lithiation/delithiation, while the cobalt, supported by the conductive carbon nanotube, accelerates polysulfides and Li2S conversion kinetics. At last, the nitrogen dopants enhance the chemisorption of sulfur species on MXene. The above multiplexed functionality enables 840 stable cycles with high capacity 900 mAh g(-1) at 2.5 mg cm(-2) S-loading and 1C. Even at a sulfur loading of 6 mg cm(-2), we can still achieve 170 cycles with a capacity retention 85.8%.	[Xiong, C.; Zhu, G. Y.; Jiang, H. R.; Chen, Q.; Zhao, T.

However, the low capacity and poor cycling life induced by the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates impede the practical application of Li-S batteries. Here, a very effective solvent-engineering strategy is proposed to fabricate thin, compact, and multifunctional binary solvent-engineered polysulfide-blocking shields (BBSs) with a superior capability of retarding the shuttle and stabilizing the cathode/anode. The Li-S batteries with a BBS separator exhibit enhanced cell kinetics, superb cycling stability with a low decay rate of 0.078% per cycle for 400 cycles at 0.5 C, and a high areal capacity of 4.91 mAh cm(-2) after 100 cycles at 2.37 mA cm(-2). In addition, the industrially viable fabrication of BBS is readily employed in practical Li-S pouch cells. The concept of solvent engineering not only renders functional interlayers/separators that significantly improve the Li-S battery performance but also is simple, versatile, and scalable to be adopted for many other promising research fields of energy storage and materials chemistry.

Despite of various attempts (e.g., addition of metal oxides and chalcogenides in the cathode, immobilization of sulfur with various carbons, and confinement of sulfur within the cathode side with membranes) in solving this problem, it still remains a major challenge for Li-S batteries. Here, we demonstrate that chemically active binders can in situ bond to the poly sulfides in the electrode. Besides the common binding functions of the cathode materials to the current collector, the covalent bonding between binders and polysulfides could bestow the higher capacity, stable cycling and high coulombic efficiency, even under the high loading of sulfur contents. Thus, this study provides an alternative and effective way in solving the shuttle effect of the dissolved lithium polysulfides for Li-S batteries.

Even though, there are so many hindrances, such as insulation nature of sulfur and shuttle mechanism, to prohibit the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a facile method to improve the performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries was reported. The composites were prepared by simple heat treatment method by embodied with carbon black (CB) and TiO2 to the sulfur. The improvement in capacity can be attributed to subsistence of the TiO2 to augment the electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery. The as-prepared cathode material exhibits the initial discharge capacity of 1399 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C.

However, it is challenging to solve the shuttling and low reduction kinetics of lithium polysulfides. Hence, the combination of electrospun and hydrothermal treatments acts as an effective strategy to synthesize copper ferrite nanoparticles decorated on nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (CF/NC). The resultant material is employed as a positive current collector containing Li2S6 catholyte for Li-S batteries. The addition of CF nanoparticles plays a vital role in capturing polysulfides in both physical and chemical adsorption. Besides, promoted sulfur conversion kinetics are obtained due to the excellent catalytic effect, which enabled significantly improved sulfur utilization, high-rate capability, and cycling stability. Under a 5.75 mg sulfur loading, the cell with CF/NC delivers an excellent cycling stability with 609 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.2 C. Even at 12.15 mg high sulfur loading, the high initial capacity of the cell is 9.4 mAh at 0.1 C.

Here, the vacuum filtration is used to prepare multiwalled carbon nanotube/La0.65Sr0.35MnO3(MWCNT/LaSrMn) composite coatings on the Celgard separator to obtain the functional separator, thus achieving a highly stable lithium-sulfur battery. In the polysulfide solution, the presence of O sites and Sr sites forms Li-O bonds and Sr-S bonds respectively, which is more conducive to polysulfide adsorption. Moreover, LaSrMn acts as an intermediate site to accept the deposition of Li2S and promote its uniform spread. The high catalytic properties of LaSrMn can accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides. The lithium-sulfur battery with an MWCNT/LaSrMn-Celgard separator exhibits excellent performance. The initial specific capacity of the battery with LaSrMn/MWCNT-Celgard separator is as high as 859.2 mAh g(-1). After 500 cycles, the capacity slowly decreases to 730.3 mAh with a little capacity attenuation rate of only 0.03% per cycle. The capacity is rapidly stabilized at 868 mAh g(-1) even after 100 cycles at 60 degrees C, with a capacity attenuation rate of 0.03% per cycle at IC.

However, the poor cycle stability caused by polysulfide shuttles, volume expansion and formation of lithium dendrites limit their practical applications. In the present work, to tackle the poor stability and unstable rate capability, a MOF-doping strategy is developed to construct a hollow porous carbon framework,which consists of Ni, Co particles and CNT on a N-doped shell surface (Ni/Co-CNT/NHPC). This hollow framework increases the load of S, slows down the volume changes, and can physically entrap soluble polysulfide. It is found that the CNT-coated network structure is beneficial for optimizing the conductivity and wettability of the material, which accelerates the reaction kinetics. Moreover, synergistic effect of abundant defects and Ni, Co nanoparticles strengthens the chemisorption of polysulfides, which suppresses the shuttle effect. As a consequence, the Ni/Co-CNT/NHPC-S cathode harvests a high specific capacity (1352 mA h g-1), and shows an excellent cycling stability at 1 C with low capacity decay of 0.094% over 500 cycles.

In recent times research in this field has stepped into the exploration of practical applications. However, their applications are impeded by cycling stability and short life-span mainly due to the notorious polysulfide shuttle effect. In this work, a multifunctional sulfur host fabricated by grafting highly conductive Co3Se4 nanoparticles onto the surface of an N-doped 3D carbon matrix to inhibit the polysulfide shuttle and improve the sulfur utilization is proposed. By regulating the carbon matrix and the Co3Se4 distribution, N-CN-750@Co3Se4-0.1 m with abundant polar sites is experimentally and theoretically shown to be a good LiPSs absorbent and a sulfur conversion accelerator. The S/N-CN-750@Co3Se4-0.1 m cathode shows excellent sulfur utilization, rate performance, and cyclic durability. A prolonged cycling test of the as-fabricated S/N-CN-750@Co3Se4-0.1 m cathode is carried out at 0.2 C for more than 5 months which delivers a high initial capacity of 1150.3 mAh g(-1) and retains 531.0 mAh g(-1) after 800 cycles with an ultralow capacity reduction of 0.067% per cycle, maintaining Coulombic efficiency of more than 99.3%. The reaction details are characterized and analyzed by ex situ measurements. This work highly emphasizes the potential capabilities of transition-metal selenides in lithium-sulfur batteries.

The S/activated CCB composites with 64 and 73 wt% sulfur are prepared by a simple heat treatment method. The microstructure and morphology of the as-prepared S/activated CCB composites are characterized by thermogravimetry (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is demonstrated that sulfur can be loaded into the pores of the host activated CCB matrix in highly dispersed state, when sulfur loading is limited to 64 wt%. While the loaded sulfur increases to 73 wt%, some crystalline sulfur nanoparticles of less than 2 nm can be observed near the pores of the host activated CCB matrix. As expected, the S/activated CCB composite with 64 wt % sulfur presents the optimized electrochemical performance, including the utilization of active sulfur, discharge capacity and cycle stability. Apparently, in order to improve the electrochemical performance of the S/activated CCB composite, the activation treatment of the commercial CCB is essential for increasing the sulfur loading.

However, their commercial applications are hindered by an undesirable polysulfide shuttling effect during the cycling procedure. Herein, nitrogen and sulfur codoped carbon nanotubes intertwined with flower-like molybdenum disulfide (NSCNTs/MoS2) were synthesized by using a feasible hydrothermal method and used as effective lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) tamers. The NSCNTs/MoS2 had a strong hybrid structure with strong interfacial interactions for physical confinement, chemical adsorption, and electrocatalytic conversion of intermediate LiPSs during the charge-discharge process. The NSCNTs intensified the flexibility and constructed a conductive framework for rapid ion/electron transfer, whereas the electrocatalysis of MoS2 managed the sulfur reaction chemistry in two ways: it chemically immobilized LiPSs through Li-S bonds and kinetically sped up the sulfur redox reactions. Owing to these merits, the Li-S cell with a NSCNTs/MoS2 host and NSCNTs/MoS2-coated separator (NSCNTs/MoS2/S-NM) exhibited a high reversible capacity of 814 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C and long-lasting cycling durability with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.02 % per cycle over 1000 cycles. Accordingly, rationally integrating the concepts of physical immobilization, chemical capture, and electrocatalysis to establish a multifaced cell structure for the architecture of high-performance Li-S batteries is a significant strategy.

Composite consisting of TiO2 microboxes and carbon nanotubes (CNT) is applied as a coating layer on conventional polymer separator for lithium-sulfur batteries. The cell using a modified separator exhibits enhanced cycling performance and rate capability. A discharge capacity of 852.3 mAh g(-1) is achieved at 0.2 C after 200 cycles and more than 500 mAh g(-1) of discharge capacity could be retained after 1000 cycles at 1 C, much better than the cells employing untreated or sole CNT-coated separator. Even at a high C-rate of 10 C, the cell with CNT-TiO2-coated separator could deliver a high specific discharge capacity of 561 mAh g(-1). Such enhanced electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of CNT and TiO2 on suppressing shuttle reactions of lithium polysulfides.

However, the polysulfides' shuttling effect seriously degraded the cycle stability and capacity and hindered their commercial applications. Here, we design and fabricate a bifunctional composite separator including a polypropylene (PP) matrix layer and Keggin polyoxometalate [PW12O40](3-)/Super P composite retarding layer by utilizing the Coulombic repulsion between polyanion and polysulfides. Such a binary composite separator shows the effects in enhancing the Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability. Compared with the polypropylene (PP) matrix separator, the capacity is improved by 41% after 120 cycles when using the PW12/Super P separator. It is the first time that the polyoxometalate (POM) matrix is used as a bifunctional separator for lithium-sulfur batteries, demonstrating the promise of POM-based separators in reducing the shuttling effect of Li-S battery.

The specific capacity and cycling stability of sulfur cathode, however, are impeded by intrinsic poor electrical conductivity of sulfur and dissolution of polysulfides intermediates. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to overcome the two obstacles by designing a bimetallic-organic-framework-derived nano-sulfur host consisted of porous graphitic carbon and bimetallic cobalt-nickel oxides (C/NiCo2O4), in which porous carbon and NiCo2O4 not only entrapping the polysulfides effectively through physical and chemical entrapment capability, but also serving as a highly conductive matrix for sulfur. With a sulfur content of 68.9% in the composite, the composite cathode delivered a specific capacity of 977mAhg(-1) and maintained 673mAhg(-1) at 0.5C over 500 cycles. Besides, the binding mechanism between NiCo2O4 and polysulfides has been explored by ex situ XRD and density functional theory(DFT)simulation. This work may provide a feasible strategy to improve the performance of lithium-sulfur battery.

The hybrid MC-Meso C-doped TiO2 host material is produced by a low-cost, hydrothermal and annealing process. The resulting conductive material shows dual microporous and mesoporous behavior which enhances the effective trapping of sulfur and polysulfides. The hybrid MC-Meso C-doped TiO2/S composite material possesses rutile TiO2 nanotube structure with successful carbon doping while sulfur is uniformly distributed in the hybrid MC-Mesa C-doped TiO2 composite materials after the melt infusion process. The electrochemical measurement of the hybrid material also shows improved cycle stability and rate performance with high sulfur loading (61.04%). The material delivers an initial discharge capacity of 802 mAh g(-1) and maintains it at 578 mAh g(-1) with a columbic efficiency greater than 97.1% after 140 cycles at 0.1 C. This improvement is thought to be attributed to the unique hybrid nanostructure of the MC-Meso C-doped TiO2 host and the good dispersion of sulfur in the narrow pores of the MC spheres and the mesoporous C-doped TiO2 support.

Herein, we investigated the electrochemical characteristics of lithium sulfur batteries with lithiated silicon anode in the liquid electrolytes based on ether solvents. The silicon anodes were lithiated by direct contact with lithium foil in a 1M lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) solution in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) at a volume ratio of 1: 1. They were readily lithiated up to similar to 40% of their theoretical capacity with a 30 min contact time. In particular, the carbon mesh reported in our previous work was employed in order to maximize the performance by capturing the dissolved polysulfide in sulfur cathode. The reversible specific capacity of the lithiated silicon-sulfur batteries with carbon mesh was 1,129 mAh/g during the first cycle, and was maintained at 297 mAh/g even after 50 cycles at 0.2 C, without any problems of poor passivation or lithium dendrite formation.

Herein, a multifunctional conductive nanohybrid, which acts as a sulfur host, is rationally constructed by inserting/intertwining carbon nanotubes (CNTs) onto Co-embedded N-doped porous dual carbon polyhedrons derived from a resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) polymer layer enwrapping ZIF-67 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (Co, N-C@RFC/CNTs). The porous carbon polyhedrons can accommodate a high amount of sulfur owing to their large inner void space; the RF coating carbon layer and the CNTs effectively increase the conductivity and build a network for providing smooth ions/e(-) pathways; In addition, the polar Co particles and electronegative N heteroatoms synergistically strengthen the chemical adsorption of polysulfides and accelerate the redox reaction of the sulfur cathode. Benefiting from these advantages, the as-fabricated Co, N-C@RFC/CNTs/S cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 1373.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, an impressive rate performance with 659.2 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C, and an outstanding cycling stability with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.041 % per cycle for 500 cycles at 1.0 C. This work provides a facile and high-efficiency approach to fabricating excellent-performance storage materials based on an MOF precursor.

In this work, three-dimensional porous microspheres composed of nanosized sulfur particles, nitrogen-doped oxygen-deficient TiO2-x nanorods and reduced graphene oxide (N-TiO2-x/RGO/S) were synthesized as sulfur host material for the first time in spray-drying process. The microspheres construction with void spaces mitigated volumetric expansion upon charge/discharge cycling and improved sulfur utilization. Furthermore, the N-TiO2-x nanorods enhanced the conductivity of the material and exhibited strong capability for adsorption and the migration of lithium polysulfides, which was demonstrated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Due to such advantages, the N-TiO2-x/RGO/S cathode delivered excellent rate capability and stable cycle performance at 1.0 C over 300 cycles with a specific capacity about 700 mAh g(-1).

In this work, a polyaniline (PANi)-coated mesoporous carbon composite is synthesized by direct polymerization of aniline monomer in mesoporous Ketjenblack (KB) carbon and is used as cathode material for LiS batteries. Different mass percentages of PANi can be infiltrated into the pores of KB carbon by simply varying the amount of monomer. Sulfur is encapsulated into the composite by the melt diffusion method, and the electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries is investigated. The results indicate that the mass percentage of PANi plays a crucial role in the cycle stability of lithium sulfur batteries. The infiltrated PANi is capable of enhancing the intimate contact of sulfur with carbon and trapping polysulfides, which improves the utilization of active material. However, excess PANi diminishes the pore volume of mesoporous KB carbon, which limits sulfur loading and impairs the capability of cells. The cell with the composite containing 30% of PANi shows an improved cyclability of 675 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C-rate, demonstrating promising applications in Li-S batteries with high energy density.

However, its surface and interface characteristics influence the electrochemical performance significantly, and there are also obvious volume changes during electrochemical cycling In this study, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were used as binder for S@pPAN cathode to regulate the surface of S@pPAN and alleviate volume changes during charging and discharging At a current density of 2C, capacity retention rate of the batteries after 140 cycles was 84.7%, and a high specific capacity of 1147 mAh.g(-1) can still be maintained at a high current density of 7C. The ultimate tensile strength for the film of the composite binder increases by 41 times after adding SWCNT, and the composite binder guarantees a more stable electrode interface during operation, thereby effectively improves the cycle stability of the as sembled lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, practical applications of LSBs are still hindered by their rapid capacity decay and short cycle life, especially at high rates. Herein, a highly N-doped (approximate to 13.42 at%) hierarchical carbon sponge (HNCS) with strong chemical adsorption for lithium polysulfide is fabricated through a simple sol-gel route followed by carbonization. Upon using the HNCS as the sulfur host material in the cathode and an HNCS-coated separator, the battery delivers an excellent cycling stability with high specific capacities of 424 and 326 mAhg(-1) and low capacity fading rates of 0.033% and 0.030% per cycle after 1000 cycles under high rates of 5 and 10C, respectively, which are superior to those of other reported carbonaceous materials. These impressive cycling performances indicate that such a battery could promote the practical application prospects of LSBs.

In this paper, a mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon (MPNC)-sulfur nanocomposite is reported as a novel cathode for advanced Li-S batteries. The nitrogen doping in the MPNC material can effectively promote chemical adsorption between sulfur atoms and oxygen functional groups on the carbon, as verified by X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, and the mechanism by which nitrogen enables the behavior is further revealed by density functional theory calculations. Based on the advantages of the porous structure and nitrogen doping, the MPNC-sulfur cathodes show excellent cycling stability (95% retention within 100 cycles) at a high current density of 0.7 mAh cm(-2) with a high sulfur loading (4.2 mg S cm(-2)) and a sulfur content (70 wt%). A high areal capacity (approximate to 3.3 mAh cm(-2)) is demonstrated by using the novel cathode, which is crucial for the practical application of Li-S batteries. It is believed that the important role of nitrogen doping promoted chemical adsorption can be extended for development of other high performance carbon-sulfur composite cathodes for Li-S batteries.

The magnesium citrate is used as the precursor of the carbon and provides nanometer sized MgO particles template. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WA-XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and N-2 sorption analysis show that the resultant carbon material possesses mesopores structure (about 6.5 nm), high surface area (1432 m(2) g(-1)), and large pore volumes (2.894 cm(3) g(-1)) after pyrolysis (1000 degrees C). Elemental maps confirm that sulfur is homogeneously dispersed in the MC framework after encapsulation. Electrochemical measurements performed on this mesoporous carbon used as an electrode material for Li/S batteries show excellent discharge capacity (1083.6 mAh g(-1)) at current density 200 mAg(-1). The mesopores with large volume and high surface area are crucial in loading insulated sulfur, which provide enough space and good conducting networks for active materials. Meanwhile, mesoporous structure with high adsorption capacity can both effectively accommodate the polysulfide anions and improve the electrochemical performance of Li/S batteries.

However, most studies use flooded electrolytes to achieve a high specific capacity at the expense of lowering the specific energy. Understanding lithium-sulfur battery performance with lean electrolytes is highly desirable. Herein, a modified Pechini method is developed to synthesize a nanoporous carbon host decorated with Ni3S2@Ni particles. Such a cathode delivers enhanced specific capacities with extended cycling life in lean electrolytes, due to the dual functions of the Ni3S2 shell, which can both facilitate reaction kinetics and promote electrolyte wetting. This work highlights a strategy to rationally design cathodes for high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries.

Elemental sulfur was then loaded to the micropores through a solution infiltration method to form rice husk-derived activated carbon (RHAC)@S composite materials. The as-prepared RHAC@S composites with 0.25 mg cm(-1) and 0.38 mg cm(-1) of sulfur loading were tested as cathodes for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The 0.25 mg cm(-1) sulfur loaded sample showed an initial discharge capacity of 1080 mA h/g at a 0.1 C rate. After 50 cycles of charge/discharge tests at the current density of 0.2 C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 312 mA h/g. The RHAC material delivered a capacity of more than 300 mA h/g at a current density of 1.7 C.

Herein, we demonstrate rod-like nano sulfur (nS) deposited onto radially oriented open-porous microspherical reduced graphene oxide (rGO) architectures for improved rate and cyclic capabilities of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The combined chemistry of a spray-frozen assembly and ozonation drives the formation of a radially oriented open-porous structure and an overall microspherical morphology as well as uniform distribution and high loading of rod-like nS. Moreover, an optimum composition and strong bonding of the rGO/nS hybrid enables the optimization of redox kinetics for high sulfur utilization and high-rate capacities. The resulting rGO/nS hybrid provides a specific capacity and first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 1269.1 mAh g(-1) and 98.5%, respectively, which are much greater than those of ice-templated and physically mixed rGO/nS hybrids and radially oriented open-porous rGO/bulk sulfur with the same hybrid composition. A 4C capacity of 510.3 mAhg(-1) and capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle over 500 cycles (70.9% of the initial capacity over 300 cycles) also support the synergistic effect of the rod-like nS strongly interacting with the radially oriented open-porous rGO microspheres.

A polar conductive substrate serving as the sulfur positive host is proven to be an excellent strategy for the efficient immobilization and rapid conversion of LiPSs. Herein, a heterostructure material of niobium nitride nanowires encapsulated in carbon (NbN-NW@C) as a positive host for the sulfur cathode was designed and investigated. First-principles calculation confirms the existence of a strong chemical interaction between NbN-NW and LiPSs, which catalytically promotes the mutual conversion of LiPSs and insoluble Li2S/Li2S2, thus enhancing the redox reaction kinetics. The carbon layer with an adjustable thickness effectively improves the adsorption capacity of the host for LiPSs, and N-2 adsorption-desorption shows that the maximum specific surface area of NbN-NW@C-800 is 81.0 m(2) g(-1). Besides, the metallic property of NbN-NW facilitates electron transmission and improves sulfur utilization. Benefiting from the rational design of the electrode structure, the cathode exhibits excellent cycle stability (the capacity retention is 81.8% after 100 cycles) and rate properties (783 mAh g(-1) at 1 C).

Herein, we report a pomegranate-like microspheres material, which consist of Co nanoparticles embedded with N-doped carbon and interwoven by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The pomegranate-like composite, referred to as Co-NC@G-CNTs, formed by spray-drying and heat treatment, offers large surface area and highly porous feature that uniforms sulfur distribution and therefore facilitates polysulfide (LiPS) confinement. The three-dimensional conductive network created by Co nanoparticles and CNTs significantly enhances the ion/electron transportation within the electrode. Meanwhile, the decorated Co nanoparticles serve as active site that strengthens the chemical adsorption of LiPS. It also endows CoNC@G-CNTs with promoted LiPS catalytic transformation. The study also highlighted that the introduction of CNTs in the microsphere is essential in enhancing the electrochemical performance of three-dimensional structured sulfur cathode. Attributed to these complementing features, the pomegranate-like Co-NC@G-CNTs composite exhibited a high initial specific capacity (1290 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C), and an excellent rate performance (708 mAh g(-1) at 3.0C). Moreover, the capacity at 1.0C faded at a rate of 0.058% per cycle over 500 cycles. The S/Co-NC@G-CNTs microspheres hold much potential for the development of Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, their commercial success is impeded by deterioration of sulfur utilization, significant capacity fade, and poor cycle life, which are principally originated from the severe shuttle effect in relation to the dissolution and migration of lithium polysulfides. Herein, we proposed an effective and facile strategy to anchor the polysulfides and improve sulfur loading by constructing a three-dimensionally hierarchical Ni/Ni3S2/S cathode. This self-supported hybrid architecture is sequentially fabricated by the partial sulfurization of Ni foam by a mild hydrothermal process, followed by physical loading of elemental sulfur. The incorporation of Ni3S2, with high electronic conductivity and strong polysulfide adsorption capability, can not only empower the cathode to alleviate the shuttle effect, but also afford a favorable electrochemical environment with lower interfacial resistance, which could facilitate the redox kinetics of the anchored polysulfides. Consequently, the obtained Ni/Ni3S2/S cathode with a sulfur loading of similar to 4.0 mg/cm(2) demonstrated excellent electrochemical characteristic For example, at high current density of 4 mA/cm(2), this thick cathode demonstrated a discharge capacity of 441 mAh/g at the 150th cycle.

Carbon-coated separators can limit the diffusion of polar polysulfide intermediates between electrodes. However, the capacity fading still exists owing to the weak interaction of nonpolar carbons. Herein, a novel lithium vanadium(V) oxide-coated hybrid separator (LiV3O8-HS) is designed for enhancing the performance of Li-S batteries. The results show that the LiV3O8 coating acts as a shield-like redox mediator to physically block the diffusion of polysulfide intermediates and chemically promotes the conversion of soluble higher-order polysulfides to insoluble short-chain polysulfides via internal disproportionation reactions, accelerating the redox reaction kinetics and lessening the active material loss during cycling. As a consequence, Li-S cells with the LiV3O8-HS demonstrated superior electrochemical performance despite using a pure sulfur cathode, with a high initial discharge capacity of 1254 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and superior long-term cyclability with a low average capacity decline of 0.063% per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. The coating of the commercial separator, which can be straightforwardly adopted in an industrial process, offers a simple and powerful route for boosting the performance of Li-S batteries toward commercial application.

The NGA/S composites are fabricated using ethylenediamine (EDA) as a nitrogen source and 3D graphene structural modifier through a combination of one-pot hydrothermal and heat melt diffusion methods. The as-prepared NGA/S composites present a porous 3D interconnected network structure with a high sulfur loading of 77.3 wt%. The electrode with NGA/S as cathode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1258 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of 0.1 C and maintains a stable capacity of 1077 mAh g(-1) after 75 cycles. This high battery capacity and good cycle stability is primarily attributed to the flexible porous 3D structure and N-doping in graphene for this NGA/S structural design which can provide higher sulfur loading, faster charge transfer pathway and better immobilization of lithium polysulfides. The present study demonstrates that the 3D NGA/S composite is a promising material for application as the cathode in Li-S batteries.

Here, inspired by dandelion with consecutive hollow channel, nitrogen-doped hollow carbon frame-work (NHCF) as sulfur host was obtained via a simple thermal calcination in ammonia atmosphere for lithium-sulfur battery. The NHCF can effectively confine polysulfides and electrochemical reaction within the hollow channel and expedite lithium ion diffusion and electrode transport through porous nitrogen-doped carbon rampart. With this strategy, a high-level active sulfur loading of 80% and high sulfur utilization can be realized. As a result, the NHCF/S delivered an advanced initial capacity of 950 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 0.5 C with small capacity fading rates of 0.049% per cycle after 500 cycles. Additionally, an average reversible areal capacity of nearly 5 mAh cm(-2) was realized under raised sulfur mass loading of 5.5 mg cm(-2). This superior electrochemical energy storage property endows renewable biomass derived carbon host with promising potential for low-cost rechargeable battery application.

In this work, catalytic FeSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated with carbon nanoboxes (FeSe2@C NBs) that derived from the selenide reaction of yolk-shelled Fe3O4@C are proposed as a multifunctional sulfur host to restrain the polysulfide shuttle effect and accelerate the polysulfide redox conversion. The experimental results display that the S/FeSe2@C cathode exhibits better sulfur utilization, higher rate performance, and longer cycle life compared to S/Fe3O4@C cathode. Even after 700 cycles at 1C, an ultralow capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle of S/FeSe2@C cathode can still be maintained. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FeSe2@C NBs possess stronger chemical affinity to polysulfides and lower energy gap between bonding and antibonding orbitals, which could promote the interfacial charge transfer kinetics, thus enabling better Li-S battery performance.

However, their commercial applications are still hampered with the low conductivity and sulfur utilization, the low sulfur loading and the serious capacity fading at a high current rate. Herein, we prepared flower-like molybdenum disulfide and carbon nanotubes (MoS2/CNTs) composites with mesoporous structures for high sulfur utilization cathodes. The flowerlike MoS2 can immobilize sulfur and obstruct the solubility of polysulfide within the structures. The MoS2/CNTs-S cathode with 2.6 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading and capacity per area of 3.83 mA h cm(-2) delivers an initial specific discharge capacity of 1473 mA h g(-1) with 88.0% sulfur utilization and maintains a reversible capacity of 855.5 mA h g(-1) with coulombic efficiency up to 96.6% after 50 cycles at the current rate of 0.2 C (335.0 mA g(-1)). Impressively, the MoS2/CNTs-S cathode at 5C shows the high specific capacity of 1254 mA h g(-1) with 76.0% sulfur utilization and maintains 384.0 mA h g(-1) with an average coulombic efficiency of 91% after 200 cycles. The MoS2/CNTs-S cathode could be a good candidate for high-performance Li-S battery.

However, their low binding energy with sulfur and poor absorbability of polysulfides leads to the "shuttle effect," reducing the stability of MOFs. With strong bonding ability to sulfur, indium-based MOFs, in which the indium (In) shows the Lewis acid character, can form the stable chemical bonds of In-S. Based on it, we used the indium-based MOF-CPM-200 as a carrier, combined with the conductive multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) and sulfur to construct the composite cathode material of CPM-200/CNT@S. The unique composite structure for cathode materials of Li-S batteries can inhibit the "shuttle effect" and enhance conductivity. The initial discharge capacity of the CPM-200/CNT@S can reach as high as 1400 mAh.g(-1) and maintain a capacity of about 840 mAh.g(-1) after 100 charge-discharge cycles at 0.1 C, the coulombic efficiency approaches 100%. This work offers a new strategy for constructing the MOFs-based cathode materials for Li-S batteries with high performance.

The polycrystalline structure and nanodomain nature of the copolymer are revealed through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). PIP polymer is also used as binders for the electrode to further capture the dissovlved polysulfides. A high areal capacity of ca. 7.0 mAh/cm(2) and stable cycling are achieved based on the PIPS nanosulfur composite with a PIP binder, crucial to commercialization of lithium sulfur batteries. The chemical confinement both at material and electrode level alleviates the diffusion of polysulfides and the shuttle effect. The sulfur electrodes, both fresh and cycled, are analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This approach enables scalable material production and high sulfur utilization at the cell level.

However, the shuttle effect and interface instability of lithium metal anode plague their electrochemical performance. Researchers have made great efforts to solve these issues by introducing suitable electrolyte additives. Herein, we find a new electrolyte additive, Trithiocyanuric acid (TMT), greatly improving the Li-S battery electrochemical performance. The TMT decreases the polysulfides concentration in the electrolyte and inhibits the shuttle effect by changing the reaction pathway of active materials. Moreover, a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the lithium metal anode with TMT enables the Li/Cu cell with an over potential of about 0.02 V at a current density of 0.5 mA cm(-2) for over 500 h. Li-S batteries with TMT show an extremely high reversible capacity of 674.5 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5C and a low capacity fading rate of 0.12% per cycle for 300 cycles. Most importantly, Li-S pouch cells (300 Wh kg(-1)) with TMT exhibit stable long cycle with a high specific capacity of 602 mAh g(-1) after 170 cycles at 0.1C, which greatly promotes the practical applications of Li-S batteries. This work demonstrates that multi aspect modifying together can better realize high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the poor conductivity and large volumetric expansion of sulfur result in low rate performance and unfavorable cycle stability. Herein, a laminated structure of sulfur/reduced graphene oxide intercalated by carbon nanotube (CNT-rGO/S) composites was designed and fabricated for the first time to address the issue. The composites prepared via hydrothermal coprecipitation was endowed a perfect crystal and highly integrated structure, which retained a good electrical conductivity and accommodated the sulfur volume expansion due to the sufficient free space between the CNT-intercalated graphene layers. The CNT-rGO/S cathode exhibits a good capacity of 783.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C and a desirable cycling stability with 77.2% of the capacity remaining after 1000 cycles even at a rate as high as 5 C, which offers great potential for practical applications in Li-S batteries.

A melting-evaporation route was adopted to synthesize two sulfur/microporous carbon (S/MC) composites, of which sulfur content is controllable, and ether-based or ester-based electrolytes were used to evaluate the synthesized composites for the lithium sulfur batteries. According to electrochemical results, the S/MC composite with 65.2 wt% S in the ether-based electrolyte exhibited optimized performance as compared with the composite with 65.2 wt% S in the ester-based electrolyte, as well as the composite with 58.6 wt% S in the two kinds of electrolytes.

Despite this, the poor cyclic stability induced by the shuttle effect of electrolyte-soluble intermediate polysulfides is one of the great obstacles for the application of Li-S batteries. To overcome this issue, here we report a self-template synthesis of metallic and polar Co9S8 nanocrystals inlaid carbon (Co9S8/C) hollow nanopolyhedra as an efficient sulfur host material. The Co9S8/C hollow nanopolyhedra with large inner space can ensure the loading mass of sulfur and buffer the volume expansion of Li2Sx species during cycling; while the metallic and polar Co9S8/C shell offers synergetic spatial confinement and chemical binding to immobilize polysulfides and prevent the shutting effect. The Co9S8/C-S composite cathode exhibits high capacity and long cycle life with a low capacity decay of 0.041% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. When the areal sulfur content is as high as 3.0 mg cm(-2), the Co9S8/C-S cathode still maintains high cycling stability.

However, little effort has been devoted to understanding the relationship between the electronic state of metal oxides and a catalyst's properties in Li-S cells. Herein, defect-rich heterojunction electrocatalysts composed of ultrathin TiO2-x nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for Li-S batteries are reported. Theoretical simulations indicate that oxygen vacancies and heterojunction can enhance electronic conductivity and chemical adsorption. Spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques further indicate that the rich surface vacancies in TiO2-x nanosheets result in highly activated trapping sites for LiPS and lower energy barriers for fast Li ion mobility. Meanwhile, the redistribution of electrons at the heterojunction interfaces realizes accelerated surface electron exchange. Coupled with a polyacrylate terpolymer (LA132) binder, the CNT@TiO2-x-S electrodes exhibit a long cycle life of more than 300 cycles at 1 C and a high area capacity of 5.4 mAh cm(-2). This work offers a new perspective on understanding catalyst design in energy storage devices through band engineering.

Efficient immobilization and fast conversion of soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates (LiPSs) are crucial to the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a novel strategy to simultaneously achieve large capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life by utilizing mesoporous niobium nitride microspheres/N-doped graphene nanosheets (NbN@NG) hybrids as multifunctional host materials for sulfur cathodes. The mesoporous NbN microspheres chemically immobilize LiPSs via Nb-S chemical bonding and catalytically promote conversion of LiPSs into insoluble Li2S resulting in enhanced redox reaction kinetics. Moreover, the highly conductive NbN and N-doped graphene nanosheets provide rapid electron transport and consequently, the S/NbN@NG cathode demonstrates a large capacity of 948 mAh g(-1) at 1C (1C = 1650 mA g(-1)), high rate capability of 739 mAh g(-1) at 5C, and excellent cycle stability with a capacity decay of 0.09% per cycle for over 400 cycles. The results described here provide insights into the design of multifunctional host materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the low conductivity of electrode materials, large volume expansion rate and shuttle effect, rapid decline of battery capacity and low cycle lifetime have restricted the commercialization of LIBs. In this paper, a type of silver-coated Co@NC porous carbon (ZIF-67 derivatives) is used as the principal material of the lithium-sulfur battery cathode (denoted Ag-Co@NC). These composites not only confine the active materials to the ordered pore structure composites but also inhibit the free migration of polysulfide and improve the redox reaction. Furthermore, uniformly modified silver nanoparticles are beneficial for enhancing the conductivity of Li2S, thus exhibiting good rate performance and capacity and effectively improving the electrochemical performance of the material.

The morphology, structure and electrochemical property of the obtained NSCNT/S are explored by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical tests. The results show that NSCNT possesses a high N content and unique mesoporous carbon framework with large specific surface area of 1029 m(2) g(-1), which can not only favor rapid electron and Li-ion transfer but also effectively mitigate dissolved polysulfides via strong chemical and physical adsorption. Due to the synergetic interaction of NSCNT, the NSCNT/S delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1241.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and large rate capacity of 1175.5 mAh g(-1) at 1 C with ultralow capacity decay of 0.1% per cycle and high areal mass loading of 3.1 mg cm(-2). This eco-friendly NSCNT/S can offer an appealing improvement for the applications of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the low specific capacity and inferior cycling stability of cathode are real bottlenecks in practical lithium-sulfur battery, owing to the low sulfur content and tap density of cathode with lightweight and nonpolar carbon host materials. In this study, conductive RuO2 stacking microspheres are designed and demonstrated as sulfur immobilizer for lithium-sulfur battery. The stacked RuO2 microspheres exhibit not only good conductive framework for both the transport of electrons and diffusion of electrolyte, but outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the conversion of lithium polysulfides. Moreover, the polarity of RuO2 is helpful to trap and confine soluble polysulfides during cycling. With a high tap density of 1.4 g cm(-3) and high sulfur content of 81.8 wt%, the S/RuO2 composite delivers a high gravimetric and volumetric capacity of 985 mAh g(-composite )(-1)and 1360 mAh cm(-composite )(-3)at 0.2 C rate, respectively. Resulting from the fast redox kinetics, an excellent rate capability of 479 mAh g(-composite)(-1) can be also obtained at 5 C rate. Overall, this work unfolds a potential strategy to realize the combination of high energy density and improved cycling stability of lithium-sulfur battery. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, a series of ternary composites were synthesized with bamboo-derived hierarchical carbon (BDC) to load S and flexible polyaniline (PANI) as a coating layer. The BDC/S composite was encapsulated by different weight percentage of PANI. The ternary PANI@BDC/S composites were characterized detailly by structural and electrochemical analysis and the results revealed that the PANI@BDC/S-20% electrode presented a thin and uniform PANI coating. As a cathode material for Li-S battery, the PANI@BDC/S-20% electrode exhibited the highest initial capacity (1463 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C), outstanding long-life performance (366 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C after 500 cycles), excellent rate property (527 mAh g(-1) at 2C). The incremented gains were mainly because thin PANI coating was polymerized along with the porous carbon walls of BDC substrate, leaving an excellent hierarchical porous microstructure. The specific structure showed great physical confinement for polysulfides, meantime, the polysulfide migration could be restricted by heteroatom (N atom) doped on the PANT backbone. The soft and stable PANI shell reduce volume expansion during cycles, providing an integrated conductive framework for enhancing the electrochemical contact between S particles and carbon substrate. More important, the modified polar interface contributed to stable SEI formation. Such a novel design of cathode material demonstrated great potential for practical applications in Li-S batteries.

Specifically, lithium carbonate-carbon (Li2CO3-C) composite nanoparticles are first synthesized via ASP from aqueous solutions of sucrose and lithium salts including nitrate (LiNO3), acetate (CH3COOLi), and Li2CO3, respectively. The obtained Li2CO3-C composites are subsequently converted to Li2S-C through sulfurization by reaction to H2S. Electrochemical characterizations show excellent overall capacity and cycle stability of the Li2S-C composites with relatively high areal loading of Li2S and low electrolyte/Li2S ratio. The Li2S-C nanocomposites also demonstrate clear structure-property relationships.

However, the complicated fabricate method of the sulfur cathode limits its practical application. Recently, the fabrication of sulfur cathode via sulfur vapor deposition is becoming increasingly popular for the reason of simple process and easy industrialization. However, how to solve the severe shuttle effect of polysulfide during cycling remains a challenge in this kind of cathode. Herein, in order to decrease the immigration of polysulfide in the sulfur vapor deposition fabricated cathode, nitrogen-doped carbon fiber foam is designed by the carbonization of polyaniline treated cotton. The nitrogen species in nitrogen-doped carbon fiber foam act as the active sites for the capture of polysulfides, and the shuttle effect is suppressed effectively during cycling. With a high sulfur areal mass loading of 3 mg cm(-2), the prepared cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 443.7 mAh g(-1) and capacity retention over 97% after 500 cycles at 2C.

Images of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) show that nano-sulfur (2-20 nm) is wrapped by the transparent NSG nanosheets with wrinkled and folded features. The application of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the structure and composition of the obtained nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped graphene/sulfur (NSG/S) composites as well. The heteroatom doping content was controlled by adjusting the amount of thiourea. The XPS analysis results indicate that pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N are dominant among the product, thereby improving the cycle life of the lithium sulfur batteries. The NSG-4/S composites with sulfur loading of 68 wt% exhibits a remarkably higher reversible specific capacity of 1583 mAh g(-1), impressive rate capability, splendid specific discharge capacity of 819 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C after 100 cycles and long cycle stability of 640 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C.

As shown by previous studies and also in our recent work, functionalized graphene and graphene oxide enhance the reversibility of the charge-discharge process by trapping polysulfides in the oxygen functional groups on the graphene surface, thus minimizing polysulfide dissolution. This will be helpful for the rational design of new cathode structures based on graphene for LSBs with minimal capacity fading, low extra cost, and without the unnecessary weight increase caused by metal/metal oxide additives.

Herein, with density functional theory calculations, we show that the alloying of Fe into carbon-coated Co not only provides moderate binding interactions with the polysulfides to hinder their diffusion but also serves as an active catalyst in the spontaneous and successive lithiation of S-8 to Li2S. Based on the fast migration of Li ions and the spontaneous lithiation of Li2S2 on the carbon-coated Fe-Co alloy, the entrapping-conversion processes of polysulfides are both thermodynamically and kinetically promoted in redox cycling. Experimentally, rationally designed Co7Fe3@porous graphite carbon-carbon nanotubes (Co7Fe3@PGC-CNT) electrocatalysts are introduced into Li-S batteries through separator functionalization. Consistent with theoretical predictions, Li-S batteries with Co7Fe3@PGC-CNT modified separators exhibit a dramatically enhanced rate capacity (788 and 631 mAh g(-1) at 10 and 15 C rates, respectively) and cycling stability (a slow capacity decay of 0.05% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2.0 C), which are superior to those of most reported Li-S batteries coupled with state-of-the-art separators. Furthermore, it is shown that the excellent hindering of the shuttle effects enables a high areal capacity of 4.7 mAh cm(-2) after 90 cycles at a high sulfur loading of 6.7 mg cm(-2). Our work provides a feasible method for developing high-energy and long-life Li-S batteries, which might drive the commercialization of Li-S batteries.

Here, we present an easy and convenient method to synthesize a mono-dispersed hollow carbon sphere with a thin graphitic wall which can be utilized as a support with a good electrical conductivity for the preparation of sulfur/carbon nano-composite cathode. The hollow carbon sphere was prepared from the pyrolysis of the homogenous mixture of the mono-dispersed spherical silica and Fe-phthalocyanine powder in elevated temperature. The composite cathode was manufactured by infiltrating sulfur melt into the inner side of the graphitic wall. The electrochemical cycling shows a capacity of 425 mAh g(-1) at 3 C current rate which is more than five times larger than that for the sulfur/carbon black nano-composite prepared by simple ball milling.

Herein, we present MXene-based Ti3C2Tx (T-x stands for the surface terminations) nanodots-interspersed Ti3C2Tx nanosheet (TCD-TCS) to accomplish spatial immobilization and conversion of high-loaded sulfur species. Rich surface polar sites in TCD-TCS enhance structural integrity of the resultant electrode, while the absence of the carbon-based materials and conductive additives results in high tap density of the cathode materials. The TCD-TCS/S electrode exhibits an almost theoretical discharge capacity at medium sulfar loading of 1.8 mg cm(-2). Notably, ultrahigh volumetric capacity (1957 mAh cm(-3)) and high areal capacity (13.7 mAh cm(-2)) are synchronously achieved at a high sulfur loading of 13.8 mg cm(-2). The mechanism study of sulfur evolution during discharge process highlights the importance of the integration of MXene-based nanodots and nanosheets in Li-S batteries. This proposed methodology holds great promise for the development of various high-performance energy storage materials.
