J	Li, NR; Yu, LH; Xi, JY				Li, Narui; Yu, Lihong; Xi, Jingyu			Integrated Design of Interlayer/Current-Collector: Heteronanowires Decorated Carbon Microtube Fabric for High-Loading and Lean-Electrolyte Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	SMALL			English	Article						high sulfur loading; in situ capture-catalysis; integrated interlayer; current-collector; lean-electrolyte; lithium-sulfur batteries; TiO; (2)-TiN heteronanowires	POLYSULFIDE CONVERSION; METAL PHOSPHIDES; ELECTROCATALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; LI2S; HETEROSTRUCTURES; COMPOSITE; SURFACE	Low sulfur loading, high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio, and sluggish sulfur redox reaction are the main challenges that severely impede the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). To address these problems, a self-standing hollow carbonized cotton cloth (CCC) decorated with TiO2-TiN heteronanowires (CCC@TiO2-TiN) is proposed to replace the traditional cathode. Concretely, one side of CCC@TiO2-TiN serves as a current-collector to load sulfur (CCC@TiO2-TiN/S), while the other side facing the separator acts as interlayer to inhibit shuttle effect. This advanced intergrated interlayer/current-collector cathode is endowed with excellent 3D electron/ion transportation, a strong confinement barrier, and vast sulfur loading sites. Moreover, the as-developed TiO2-TiN heteronanowires work as in situ capture and catalysis sites for the reversible and accelerated sulfur redox reaction. Therefore, the intergrated cathode of CCC@TiO2-TiN/S achieves an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 13 mg cm(-2) and delivers a superb areal capacity of 9.09 mAh cm(-2) under the ultralow E/S ratio of 4.6 mu L mg(-1). This work provides a new model material to achieve high sulfur loading and lean-electrolyte toward the practical LSBs with high specific energy density.

A Long-Life, High-Rate Lithium/Sulfur Cell: A Multifaceted Approach to Enhancing Cell Performance	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Energy storage; lithium batteries; sulfur; graphene oxides; cathodes	SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION; SULFUR CATHODES; GRAPHENE OXIDE; BATTERIES; ION; NANOPARTICLES; ELECTROLYTE; COMPOSITES; CHALLENGES; FE3O4	Lithium/sulfur (Li/S) cells are receiving significant attention as an alternative power source for zero-emission vehicles and advanced electronic devices due to the very high theoretical specific capacity (1675 mA.h/g) of the sulfur cathode. However, the poor cycle life and rate capability have remained a grand challenge, preventing the practical application of this attractive technology. Here, we report that a Li/S cell employing a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-modified sulfur-graphene oxide (S GO) nanocomposite cathode can be discharged at rates as high as 6C (1C = 1.675 A/g of sulfur) and charged at rates as high as 3C while still maintaining high specific capacity (similar to 800 mA.h/g of sulfur at 6C), with a long cycle life exceeding 1500 cycles and an extremely low decay rate (0.039% per cycle), perhaps the best performance demonstrated so far for a Li/S cell. The initial estimated cell-level specific energy of our cell was 500 W.h/kg, which is much higher than that of current Li-ion cells (similar to 200 W.h/kg). Even after 1500 cycles, we demonstrate a very high specific capacity (similar to 740 mA.h/g of sulfur), which corresponds to similar to 414 mA.h/g of electrode: still higher than state-of-the-art Li-ion cells. Moreover, these Li/S cells with lithium metal electrodes can be cycled with an excellent Coulombic efficiency of 96.3% after 1500 cycles, which was enabled by our new formulation of the ionic liquid-based electrolyte. The performance we demonstrate herein suggests that Li/S cells may already be suitable for high-power applications such as power tools. Li/S cells may now provide a substantial opportunity for the development of zero-emission vehicles with a driving range similar to that of gasoline vehicles.

However, the electron conductivity and Li+ ion diffusion need to be enhanced due to the low graphitization and the restricted ion transport. In order to improve the rate capability and cycling stability of the cathode, we propose a wafer-like structure to realize the high conductivity and structural stability of the porous carbon substrate. The graphene layers ensure high electron transport, while the sandwiched porous carbon with a micro/mesoporous structure guarantees fast ion diffusion. Meanwhile, the wafer-like structure enjoys good structural stability and also endows the cathode with a long cycle life. The obtained S/I-rGO-G cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 1138 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, a favorable capacity retention of 600 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1C and a superior rate capability of 638 mA h g(-1) at 2C.

However, many porous carbon materials are prepared by complicated preparation processes, facing challenges including low yields, toxic chemicals, and high-energy consumption. In this work, a simple method is reported for the preparation of mesoporous carbon with a high surface area (2166 m(2) g(-1)) and an ultra large pore volume (4.09 cm(3) g(-1)) by the direct carbonization of an adipic acid and zinc powder mixture without further chemical/physical activation process. The mesoporous carbon is composed of nanosheets with abundant capsule-like nanopores of around 15 nm, exhibiting a hierarchically assembled flower-like structure. The porous carbon nanosheets (PCNSs) with a hierarchical structure are used as the host for sulfur to form a homogeneous composite (S/PCNS) through a conventional heat infiltration process. Excellent electrochemical performance is achieved with S/PCNS as the cathode of a Li-S battery. The S/PCNS composite with 62 wt% sulfur exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 1384 mA h g(-1) and retains a reversible capacity of 657 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C rate. Remarkably, the S/PCNS composite exhibits a decay rate of only 0.046% per cycle within 500 cycles at 1C rate. The high surface area, large pore volume, and sheet-like two-dimensional (2D) structure of the micro/mesoporous carbon matrix render the sulfur-based cathode with superior electrochemical kinetics, rate capability, and long-life performance.

However, they have the problems of short cycling performance, low sulfur loading and shuttle effect; in order to overcome these problems, more efforts have been devoted to the exploration of effective host materials for sulfur confinement. Herein, we report a facile approach for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) nanosheets, derived from imine-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as the host material. In situ nitrogen doping is very uniform due to the inherited nitrogen element distributed uniformly in the COF skeleton. Sulfur-loaded NPC composites can achieve a high sulfur loading amount of 71.8% and enhanced lithium-sulfur battery performance, in terms of a high initial discharge capacity (1398 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C) and good cycling properties (reversible capacity of 833 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles). The existence of nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets with a high surface area and controlled porosity can lead to effective immobilization of the polysulfides and simultaneous improvement of the reaction kinetics of the sulfur species. This design strategy provides an extended method for fabricating high performance cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries.

The present study explored biomass-derived porous carbon as polysulfide reservoir to modify the surface of glass fiber (GF) separator. Two different carbons were prepared from Oak Tree fruit shells by carbonization with and without KOH activation. The KOH activated porous carbon (AC) provides a much higher surface area (796 m(2) g(-1)) than pyrolized carbon (PC) (334 m(2) g(-1)). The R factor value, calculated from the X-ray diffraction pattern, revealed that the activated porous carbon contains more single-layer sheets with a lower degree of graphitization. Raman spectra also confirmed the presence of spa-hybridized carbon in the activated carbon structure. The C-OH functional group was identified through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for the polysulfide capture. Simple and straightforward coating of biomass-derived porous carbon onto the GF separator led to an improved electrochemical performance in Li-S cells. The Li-S cell assembled with porous carbon modified GF separator (ACGF) demonstrated an initial capacity of 1324 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, which was 875 mAh g(-1) for uncoated GF separator (calculated based on the 2nd cycle). Charge transfer resistance (K) values further confirmed the high ionic conductivity nature of porous carbon modified separators. Overall, the biomass-derived activated porous carbon can be considered as a promising alternative material for the polysulfide inhibition in Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Nitrogen doping of carbon materials is assumed to play an important role in sulfur immobilisation. In this study, natural silk fibroin protein is used as a precursor of nitrogen-rich carbon to fabricate a novel, porous, nitrogen-doped carbon material through facile carbonisation and activation. Porous carbon, with a reversible capacity of 815 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 60 cycles, serves as the cathode material in Li-S batteries. Porous carbon retains a reversible capacity of 567 mA h g-1, which corresponds to a capacity retention of 98% at 1 C after 200 cycles. The promising electrochemical performance of porous carbon is attributed to its mesoporous structure, high specific surface area and nitrogen doping into the carbon skeleton. This study provides a general strategy to synthesise nitrogen-doped carbons with a high specific surface area, which is crucial to improve the energy density and electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

To overcome the above issue, use of lithium-ion conductive membranes instead of the traditional porous Celgard membrane as the separator/electrolyte is one of the promising approaches. In this study, a lithiated Nafion membrane is used as a cation-selective electrolyte for Li-S batteries to suppress the polysulfide diffusion.

The modified sulfur material was investigated for use as a cathode in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The surface modification with the conducting polymer was identified with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analyses. Electrochemical evaluation revealed that surface modification with PEDOT:PSS leads to increases in initial capacity and improvements in the rate capability and cyclability of sulfur electrodes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements certified a decreased resistance of the PEDOT:PSS-coated sulfur electrode compared to a pure sulfur electrode, indicating that surface modification with a conducting polymer effectively enhanced the electrochemical performance of sulfur electrodes in Li-S batteries.

However, their use in practical applications has been greatly affected by their poor cycle life and low rate performance, which can be partly attributed to the dissolution of polysulfides from the S cathode and their migration to the Li anode through the separator. While much effort has been devoted to designing the structure of the S cathodes for suppressing the dissolution of polysulfides, relatively little emphasis has been placed on modifying the separator. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach for modifying the separator with a polyvinylidene fluoride-carbon (PVDF-C) layer, where the polysulfides generated in the Li-S cells can be localized on the cathode side. Li-S batteries based on the novel separator and a cathode prepared by the simple mixing of a S powder and super P have delivered discharge capacities of 918.6 mAh g(-1), 827.2 mAh g(-1), and 669.1 mAh g(-1) after 100, 200, and 500 cycles, respectively, at a discharge rate of 0.5 C. Even under current densities of up to 5 C, the cells were able to retain a discharge capacity of 393 mAh g(-1), thereby demonstrating an excellent high rate performance and stability. The exceptional electrochemical performance could be attributed to the intense adsorption capability of the micropores, presence of C-C double bonds, and conductivity of the C network in the PVDF-C layer. This economical and simple strategy to overcome the polysulfide dissolution issues provides a commercially feasible method for the construction of Li-S batteries.

Herein, the Lewis acidic yttria hollow spheres (YHS) are rationally designed as both sulfur immobilizer and catalyst of polysulfides conversion for the advanced Li-S batteries. It can be known that the Lewis acidic yttria can effectively capture the Lewis basic polysulfides and thus mitigate the shuttle effect of Li-S battery; besides, yttria shows the enhanced catalytic effect for the kinetics of interconversion reaction from polysulfides to Li2S. As a result, either as a sulfur host or as the separator coating, yttria plays a vital part in realizing the high specific discharge capacity and good cycle stability for Li-S battery. In particular, Li-S battery with YHS@C/S cathode and YHS/CNT-0.6- modified separator (2.1 mg cm(-2) active material loading) shows a good specific discharge capacity of 912.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C. Even after 200 steady cycles, the discharge specific capacity can keep as 842.3 mAh g(-1), and the capacity decay rate is only 0.038% per cycle. When active material areal loading is increased to 4.24 mg cm(-2), it still maintains a considerable areal capacity of 3.79 mAh cm(-2). In consequence, the synergy of polysulfides confinement and catalytic conversion reaction provides a meaningful exploration for achieving the high performance of Li-S batteries.

Herein, a powerful 3D sponge nickel (SN) skeleton plus in situ surface engineering strategy, to address these issues synergistically, is reported, and a high-performance flexible LSB device is constructed. Specifically, the rationally designed spray-quenched lithium metal on the SN matrix (solid electrolyte interface (SEI)@Li/SN), as dendrite inhibitor, combines the merits of the 3D lithiophilic SN skeleton and the in situ formed SEI layer derived from the spray-quenching process, and thereby exhibits a steady overpotential within 75 mV for 1500 h at 5 mA cm(-2)/10 mA h cm(-2). Meanwhile, in situ surface sulfurization of the SN skeleton hybridizing with the carbon/sulfur composite (SC@Ni3S2/SN) serves as efficient lithium polysulfide adsorbent to catalyze the overall reaction kinetics. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and density functional theory calculations are further conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms. As a proof of concept, the well-designed SEI@Li/SN||SC@Ni3S2/SN full cell shows excellent electrochemical performance with a negative/positive ratio in capacity of approximate to 2 and capacity retention of 99.82% at 1 C under mechanical deformation. The novel design principles of these materials and electrodes successfully shed new light on the development of flexible LSBs.

This study presents a dual-confinement strategy to efficiently entrap lithium polysulfides and alleviate large volume variation by using N-doped tube-in-tube structured carbon tubes anchored on a 3D scaffold of graphene foam through the synergistic effect of spatial restriction and chemical interaction. This unique carbon hybrid structure provides sufficient empty space to confine sulfur with high loading, accommodate large volume changes during lithiation and de-lithiation, and facilitate better immobilization of polysulfides as demonstrated by first-principles calculations. Therefore, enhanced capacities, ultralong-cycling stability, and improved rate capability even with a high sulfur loading (similar to 5.6 mg cm(-2)) could be achieved.

But they suffer from rapid capacity decay and poor rate capability. The problems are mainly related to the dissolution of the intermediate polysulfides in the electrolyte, and to the poor conductivity of sulfur and the discharge products. In this work, we propose a novel dual coaxial nanocable sulfur composite fabricated with multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNT), nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), i.e. MWCNTs@S/NPC@PEG nanocable, as a cathode material for Li-S batteries. In such a coaxial structure, the middle N-doped carbon with hierarchical porous structure provides a nanosized capsule to contain and hold the sulfur particles; the inner MWCNTs and the outer PEG layer can further ensure the fast electronic transport and prevent the dissolution of the polysulfides into the electrolyte, respectively. The as-designed MWCNT@S/NPC@PEG composite shows good cycling stability and excellent rate capability.

The resulting composites with well developed mesoporous structures, high nitrogen content and uniform dispersions of La2O3 nanoparticles served as scaffolds to house sulfur for high rate lithium-sulfur batteries. Apart from their on-site trapping of polysulfides, the La2O3 nanoparticles decorated on the mesoporous carbon framework were also found to have a strong catalytic effect on sulfur reduction, offering high discharge voltages and fast electrochemical reaction kinetics. Combining the multiple effects of the well developed mesopores, nitrogen doping and La2O3 nanoparticles, the resulting ternary NMC/La2O3/S nanocomposites can deliver an initial capacity of 1043 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, which remains at 799 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. Moreover, they still maintain ultra-high rate capacities of 579 and 475 mA h g(-1) at 3 C and 5 C, respectively, after 100 cycles. These encouraging results suggest that other metal oxides with suitable adsorption and catalytic abilities can be widely applied to decorate carbon frameworks for use in high rate lithium-sulfur systems.

AlPO4 microparticles are synthesized via sol-gel and subsequent calcination process. The effects of AlPO4 on adsorption of lithium polysulfide as well as the performance of Li-S cell are investigated. The Li-S cell containing AlPO4 1.0 wt% retains 76% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and it retains 453 mAh.g(-1) at 1.0 C. Using ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infra-red analysis, it is found that lithium polysulide is chemically adsorbed on AlPO4 through Lewis acid-base interaction with the P=O groups in (PO4)(3-). The improvement in cycling stability is attributed to the strong interaction between AlPO4 and lithium polysulfides. The adsorbed lithium polysulfides are converted to thiosulfates/polythionates, preventing the dissolution of the lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte and migration to the anode. Various electrochemical measurements including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry demonstrate that AlPO4 lowers the interfacial resistance and helps fast reversible conversion reaction of sulfur to lithium polysulfides, which enables fast charge/discharge. These results suggest that use of AlPO4 is a convenient and effective way to improve the performance of Li-S batteries.

Here, indium tin oxide with different crystal structures and morphologies has been used for the modification of commercial polypropylene (PP) separators for lithium-sulfur batteries to prohibit the polysulfides shuttle and promote the Li-S cell performances. Indium tin oxide with cubic bixbyite (c-ITO) and hexagonal corundum (h-ITO) are firstly fabricated by different hydrothermal reactions and then coated on PP separator to obtain c-ITO@PP and h-ITO@PP separators. Then, c-ITO@PP and h-ITO@PP separators are used in Li-S coin cells to improve the electrochemical properties. The experimental data suggest that the cells equipped with c-ITO@PP or h-ITO@PP modified separator exhibit better electrochemical performances than the cell with unmodified PP separator and super P modified separator, which demonstrate that the c-ITO and h-ITO show better polysulfides adsorption ability than the pure carbon materials. Furthermore, the cycle retention of the Li-S cell using h-ITO@PP separator is superior than that of the one using c-ITO@PP separator. This result is supposed to be mainly induced by the more oxygen vacancies in h-ITO which is proved by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study, and the UV-vis spectroscopy of Li2S6 adsorption further demonstrate the better polysulfides adsorption ability of h-ITO.

The cathode is constructed using nitrogen (N)-doped carbon foam/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the scaffold and filled with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-encapsulated sulfur nanoparticles as the active material. The dense CNTs coated on the skeleton of the 3D N-doped foam enhance flexibility, and the highly conductive CNTs are crossed and twined together to create an interconnected skeleton for rapid electron transport. The conductive PEDOT shell of sulfur nanoparticles and the N-doping of the carbon foams restrain the dissolution of polysulfides through the enhanced chemisorption of lithium polysulfides. The best cathode with a sulfur loading of 2.6 mg cm(-2) has an eminent capacity of 1395 mA h g(-1) during the initial cycle at 0.1 C. Furthermore, freestanding cathodes are assembled into flexible Li-S batteries, which demonstrate significant achievement at various bending angles. The capacity fading rate is 0.16% per cycle at 30 degrees after 120 cycles. Its high sulfur loading, high capacitance, and good flexibility make this cathode material a promising candidate for potential application in flexible electronics.

In our strategy, Mo2C serves as a highly efficient electrocatalyst to expedite the reaction kinetics, while the interlaced framework constructed with VGSs grown on short carbon nanofibers (CFG) provides abundant conductive pathways for charge transfer. As a result, the Li-S batteries with CG-CFG@Mo2C interlayer show an ultra-high initial specific discharge capacity of 1632 mAh & BULL;g(-1), reaching a high sulfur utilization rate of 97.4%.

In this paper, an effective and novel structure of pure hollow nanographite with micropores (approximate to 8 angstrom) was successfully synthesized, and high-rate and long cycle life lithium-sulfur batteries were obtained. Ni2+ acts as a catalyst to promote the growth of super absorbent polymers into graphite carbon shells at lower temperatures. Then, after etching the internal Ni with acid, hollow nanographite spheres are obtained and there are some micropores inside graphite carbon shells. The number of micropores can be controlled by the amount of Ni in the precursor. The existence of micropores facilitates the infiltration of sulfur in the molten state and limits the shuttling of polysulfide during charging and discharging. Therefore, the structure is apt to package sulfur by better restricting the shuttle of polysulfides, which can promote the cycle performance of the S@HNG. The fast kinetics of the graphite carbon shells can increase the rate capability. Specifically, when using S@HNG as a cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries, the specific capacity can still remain at 658 mA h g(-1) under a current density of 1C after 1000 cycles. In addition, the phenomenon of self-discharge of lithium-sulfur batteries is also greatly alleviated.

Here, we report the development of advanced, multilayered, sulfur cathodes composed of alternately arranged, negatively charged S-carbon nanotube layers and positively charged S-polyaniline layers that effectively immobilize polysulfides and reduce polysulfide migration onto the Li-anode. The use of a layer-by-layer nanoassembly technique leads to a binder-free, three-dimensional porous cathode via electrostatic attraction and enables the fabrication of Li-S cells with remarkably improved performance including a long cycle life exceeding 600 cycles and a high Coulombic efficiency of 97.5% at the 1 C rate. Moreover, these Li-S cells have presented a high-rate response up to 2.5 C with high sulfur utilization (a reversible capacity of 1100 mAhg(-1), 900 mAhg(-1), 700 mAhg(-1), and 450 mAhg(-1) of sulfur at 0.3, 0.6, 1, and 2.5 C rates, respectively). The results provide important progress toward the understanding of the role of multilayered cathodes and the realization of high-efficiency and long-term service life for Li-S batteries.

Herein, conductive hollow cobalt nitride/carbon (Co5.47Nx-C) spheres with nitrogen vacancies are developed as a high-performance cathode material for use in lithium-sulfur batteries. Nitrogen vacancies are formed by annealing a zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-67) precursor in ammonia. Benefiting from its Co-N bonds and nitrogen-vacancy sites, the Co5.47Nx-C composite achieves strong anchoring of polysulfides, fast polysulfide conversion, and accelerated lithium-ion transport. The strong anchoring effect of Co(5.47)N(x)is confirmed by experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Because of its high conductivity and nitrogen vacancies, the Co(5.47)N(x)cathode exhibits faster redox reaction kinetics and lower polarization than a Co5.47N cathode without nitrogen vacancies, thus realizing promising rate and cycling performance. The optimized Co5.47Nx-C electrode delivers a capacity of 850 mA h g(-1)at 0.5C and a rate performance of 320 mA h g(-1)at 10C. This high-performance, high-rate lithium-sulfur battery is promising for widespread application in electric vehicles and intelligent devices.

However, the shuttle effect of Li-S batteries and the challenges associated with lithium metal anode caused poor cycle performance. In this work, the organosulfide poly(sulfur-1,3-diisopropenylbenzene) (PSD) was prepared as cathode material and additive of P(VDF-HFP) polymer electrolyte (P(VDF-HFP)). It was verified that P(VDF-HFP) polymer electrolyte with 10% PSD (P(VDF-HFP)-10%PSD) showed a higher ionic conductivities than that of liquid electrolyte up to 2.27 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature. The quasi-solid-state Li-S batteries fabricated with organosulfide cathode material PSD and P(VDF-HFP) based functional polymer electrolyte delivered good cycling stability (780 mAh g(-1) after 200th cycle at 0.1 C) and rate performance (613 mAh g(-1) at 1 C). The good cycling performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect of components, including the interaction between polysulfides and polymer main chain in the organosulfide cathode, the sustained organic/inorganic hybrid stable SEI layer formed by polymer electrolyte additive PSD, the improved cathode/electrolyte interface and the good affinity between P(VDF-HFP) based functional polymer electrolyte and Li metal surface. This strategy herein may provide a new route to fabricate high-performance Li-S batteries through the organosulfide cathode and functional polymer electrolyte.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is seriously hindered by the dissolution of polysulfide and the intrinsic insulation of sulfur. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to address these two problems by designing and synthesizing a cobalt, nitrogen-codoped hollow carbon sphere (Co, N@CPDA-HCS) with a highly conductive carbon shell to accommodate the sulfur. In this unique material architecture, each component synergistically serves a specific purpose: the highly conductive shell carbon can provide fast electron conduction paths and structural stability; the superfine Co nanoparticles uniformly embedded in the carbon shell can accelerate the conversion kinetics of the polysulfides by strong chemical interaction; moreover, the hollow structure provides a buffer space for the volume change of sulfur during charging and discharging, thus leading to a good cycle stability of sulfur cathodes. Co, N@CPDA-HCS exhibits balanced high electrochemical performance with respect to specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. Specifically, S/Co, N@CPDA-HCS presents a high initial gravimetric capacity of 1365 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1). The discharge capacity of 588 mA h g(-1) still remained at the current density of 1 A g(-1) after 300 cycles.

In this Perspective, we focused on the feasibility of scalable production of high-quality and large quantities of cathode composite, the construction of highly safe and highly stable electrolyte, and durable lithium metal anode. The results presented here suggest that the construction of highly secondary microstructures from nanoparticles is the key solution to achieve scalable cathode composite. Developing unconventional electrolyte solvent is a meaningful approach to develop high safety Li-S batteries. The high performance and high stability of lithium metal anode will enlighten the practical application of Li-S batteries. This Perspective presents outlooks for the key scalable techniques of realizable Li-S cell in the near future and provides promising strategies to accomplish long-cycle-life, high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

Encapsulating the sulfur in pores of small volume of a porous carbon material alleviates this problem. We report a carbon-sulfur nanoarchitecture that encapsulates sulfur in porous hollow carbon-nanotubes@carbon-nanofibers (CNTs@CNFs) with a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of 1400 m(2) g(-1) and a total pore volume of 1.12 cm(3) g(-1). As a cathode, this material with 55 wt.% sulfur shows a high capacity of similar to 1313 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, 1078 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C, 878 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, 803 mA h g(-1) at 1.5 C, 739 mA h g(-1) at 2 C, and 572 mA h g(-1) at 5 C, and maintains similar to 700 mA h g(-1) at 1 C after 100 cycles and 430 mA h g(-1) at 5 C after 200 cycles, which makes it a superior cathode material for a rechargeable Li-S battery.

In this work, an effective strategy to improve the cycle stability of lithium-sulfur batteries by covalently introducing sulfur in a metal-organic framework (MOF) was proposed for the first time; it is completely different from the traditional method of simply mixing MOFs with sulfur for designing sulfur cathodes. Compared with an Li-S cell using the simple blend of sulfur and MOFs as the cathode, the cell with the cathode consisting of sulfur covalently connected with the MOF showed outstanding long-cycling stability. Specifically, the lithium-sulfur battery with CNT@UIO66-S delivered high capacity retention of 80.19% even after 900 cycles at the current of 2C. Furthermore, at the current of 1C, the discharge capacity of the CNT@UIO66-S cell could still remain 608 mA h g(-1) after 450 cycles, while it maintained 92.12% based on the first discharge capacity. It is believed that introducing sulfur in MOFs by covalent connection may open up a new promising method to further utilize MOFs in the field of Li-S batteries.

Although impressive efforts have been made to improve the energy density of 3D microbatteries, they have all used low energy-density lithium-ion chemistries, which present a fundamental barrier to miniaturization. In addition, they require complicated microfabrication processes that hinder cost-competitiveness. Here, inkjet-printed lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cathodes for integrated nanomanufacturing are reported. Single-wall carbon nanotubes infused with electronically conductive straight-chain sulfur (S@SWNT) are adopted as an integrated current-collector/active-material composite, and inkjet printing as a top-down approach to achieve thin-film shape control over printed electrode dimensions is used. The novel Li-S cathodes may be directly printed on traditional microelectronic semicoductor substrates (e.g., SiO2) or on flexible aluminum foil. Profilometry indicates that these microelectrodes are less than 10 mu m thick, while cyclic voltammetry analyses show that the S@SWNT possesses pseudocapacitive characteristics and corroborates a previous study suggesting the S@SWNT discharge via a purely solid-state mechanism. The printed electrodes produce approximate to 800 mAh g(-1) S initially and approximate to 700 mAh g(-1) after 100 charge/discharge cycles at C/2 rate.

Here, highly-safe lithium-sulfur batteries based on flame-retardant electrolyte (dimethoxyether/1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether) coupled with functional separator (nanoconductive carbon-coated cellulose nonwoven) to resolve aforementioned bottle-neck issues are demonstrated. It is found that this flame-retardant electrolyte exhibits excellent flame retardancy and low solubility of polysulfide. In addition, Li/Li symmetrical cells using such flame-retardant electrolyte deliver extraordinary long-term cycling stability (less than 10 mV overpotential) for over 2500 h at 1.0 mA cm(-2) and 1.0 mAh cm(-2). Moreover, bare sulfur cathode-based lithium-sulfur batteries using this flame retardant electrolyte coupled with nanoconductive carbon-coated cellulose separator can retain 83.6% discharge capacity after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. Under high charge/discharge rate (4 C), lithium-sulfur cells still show high charge/discharge capacity of approximate to 350 mAh g(-1). Even at an elevated temperature of 60 degrees C, discharge capacity of 870 mAh g(-1) can be retained. More importantly, high-loading bare sulfur cathode (4 mg cm(-2))-based lithium-sulfur batteries can also deliver high charge/discharge capacity over 806 mAh g(-1) after 56 cycles. Undoubtedly, the strategy of flame retardant electrolyte coupled with carbon-coated separator enlightens highly safe lithium-sulfur batteries at a wide range of temperature.

However, low conductivity of sulfur species, dissolution of polysulfides, poor conversion from sulfur reduction, and lithium sulfide (Li2S) oxidation reactions during discharge-charge processes hinder their practical applications. Herein, under the guidance of density functional theory calculations, we have successfully synthesized large-scale single atom vanadium catalysts seeded on graphene to achieve high sulfur content (80 wt % sulfur), fast kinetic (a capacity of 645 mAh g(-1) at 3 C rate), and long-life Li-S batteries. Both forward (sulfur reduction) and reverse reactions (Li2S oxidation) are significantly improved by the single atom catalysts. This finding is confirmed by experimental results and consistent with theoretical calculations. The ability of single metal atoms to effectively trap the dissolved lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytically convert the LiPSs/Li2S during cycling significantly improved sulfur utilization, rate capability, and cycling life. Our work demonstrates an efficient design pathway for single atom catalysts and provides solutions for the development of high energy/power density Li-S batteries.

Rational design of spontaneous reactions for protecting porous lithium electrodes in lithium-sulfur batteries	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; SOLID-ELECTROLYTE; METAL ANODES; LAYER; DENDRITE; LIQUID; INTERPHASE; SCAFFOLD; NITRATE	A rechargeable lithium anode requires a porous structure for a high capacity, and a stable electrode/electrolyte interface against dendrite formation and polysulfide crossover when used in a lithium-sulfur battery. Here, we design two simple steps of spontaneous reactions for protecting porous lithium electrodes. First, a reaction between molten lithium and sulfur-impregnated carbon nanofiber forms a fibrous network with a lithium shell and a carbon core. Second, we coat the surface of this porous lithium electrode with a composite of lithium bismuth alloys and lithium fluoride through another spontaneous reaction between lithium and bismuth trifluoride, solvated with phosphorous pentasulfide, which also polymerizes with lithium sulfide residual in the electrode to form a solid electrolyte layer. This protected porous lithium electrode enables stable operation of a lithium-sulfur battery with a sulfur loading of 10.2 mg cm(-2) at 6.0 mA cm(-2) for 200 cycles.	[Ren, Y. X.; Zeng, L.; Jiang, H.

Here, a lamellar aerogel composed of Ti3C2Tx MXene/carbon nanotube (CNT) sandwiches is prepared by unidirectional freeze-drying to boost the cycling stability of high sulfur loading batteries. The produced materials are denoted parallel-aligned MXene/CNT (PA-MXene/CNT) due to the unique parallel-aligned structure. The lamellae of MXene/CNT/MXene sandwich form multiple physical barriers, coupled with chemical trapping and catalytic activity of MXenes, effectively suppressing lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttling under high sulfur loading, and more importantly, substantially improving the LiPS confinement ability of 3D hosts free of micro- and mesopores. The assembled Li-S battery delivers a high capacity of 712 mAh g(-1) with a sulfur loading of 7 mg cm(-2), and a superior cycling stability with 0.025% capacity decay per cycle over 800 cycles at 0.5 C. Even with sulfur loading of 10 mg cm(-2), a high areal capacity of above 6 mAh cm(-2) is obtained after 300 cycles. This work presents a typical example for the rational design of a high sulfur loading host, which is critical for the practical use of Li-S batteries	[Zhang, Bin; Luo, Chong; Pan, Zheng-Ze; Ma, Jiabin; He, Yan-Bing; Kang, Feiyu; Lv, Wei] Tsinghua Univ, Shenzhen Geim Graphene Ctr, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Guangmin] Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Berkeley Shenzhen Inst, Shenzhen Geim Graphene Ctr, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Nishihara, Hirotomo] Tohoku Univ, Adv Inst Mat Res WPI AIMR, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Adv Mat, Aoba Ku, Katahira 2-1-1, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Yang, Quan-Hong] Tianjin Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Chem Sci & Engn Tianjin, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, State Key Lab Chem Engn,Nanoyang Grp, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China		Lv, W (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Shenzhen Geim Graphene Ctr, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.	lv.wei@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn	Pan, Zheng-Ze/T-7194-2019; lv, wei/M-1964-2013; Nishihara, Hirotomo/I-6057-2019	Pan, Zheng-Ze/0000-0001-7021-6147; lv, wei/0000-0003-0874-3477; Nishihara, Hirotomo/0000-0003-4497-4248; Luo, Chong/0000-0003-4455-1747; Yang, Quanhong/0000-0003-2882-3968; Kang, Feiyu/0000-0002-3704-4379; Ai, Lingqin/0000-0002-4967-6816	National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFE0124500]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51772164, 52022041, 51932005]; Local Innovative and Research Teams Project of Guangdong Pearl River Talents Program [2017BT01N111]; Guangdong Special Support Program [2017TQ04C664]; Shenzhen Basic Research Project [JCYJ20180508152037520]	National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Local Innovative and Research Teams Project of Guangdong Pearl River Talents Program; Guangdong Special Support Program; Shenzhen Basic Research Project	B.Z., C.L., and G.Z. equally contributed to this work.

PhIO owns the practical advantages of low-cost, commercial availability, environmental friendliness and chemical stability. The lone pair electrons of oxygen atoms in PhIO play a critical role in forming a strong Lewis acid-base interaction with terminal Li in LiPSs. Moreover, the commercial PhIO can be easily converted to nanoparticles (approximate to 20 nm) and uniformly loaded on a carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold, ensuring sufficient chemisorption for LiPSs. The integrated functional PhIO@CNT interlayer affords a LiPSs-concentrated shield that not only strongly obstructs the LiPSs penetration but also significantly enhances the electrolyte wettability and Li+ conduction. The PhIO@CNT interlayer also serves as a "vice current collector" to accommodate various LiPSs and render smooth LiPSs transformation, which suppresses insulating Li2S2/Li2S layer formation and facilitates Li+ diffusion. The Li-S battery based on PhIO@CNT interlayer (6 wt% PhIO) exhibits stable cycling over 1000 cycles (0.033% capacity decay per cycle) and excellent rate performance (686.6 mAh g(-1) at 3 C). This work demonstrates the great potential of PhIO in regulating LiPSs and provides a new avenue towards the low-cost and sustainable application of Li-S batteries.

Effect of mesoporous carbon microtube prepared by carbonizing the poplar catkin on sulfur cathode performance in Li/S batteries	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Carbon microtube; Poplar catkin; Lithium/sulfur battery; Sulfur cathode; Sulfur/carbon microtube composite	RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES; NANOCOMPOSITE CATHODE; ELECTROLYTE; COMPOSITE; GRAPHENE	A carbon microtube (CMT) was synthesized by carbonizing the poplar catkin and composited with sulfur, serving as a cathode for lithium/sulfur batteries. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping showed the formation of a tubular structure with uniform sulfur coating on the surface of CMTs. The CMT with a mesoporous surface is beneficial to both trapping soluble polysulfide intermediates and rendering the electrical conductivity of the prepared electrode. The resulting S/CMT composite cathode can deliver an 810 mAh g(-1) reversible specific discharge capacity after 100 cycles at 0.1 C, and 585 mAh g(-1) at 1 C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, tailoring the interlayer components, structure, and chemistry to realize efficient conversion of polysulfides into insoluble lithium sulfides remains challenging. Herein, a flexible self-standing hybrid interlayer is engineered by intertwining one-dimensional (1D) V2O5 nanowires (NWs) with graphene nanoscrolls (GNS) into a robust interconnected 3D network to be used as both an upper current collector and physical/chemical polysulfide-trapper. The highly conductive and open GNS framework provides bicontinuous transfer channels for rapid electron and ion transport across the cathode/separator interface. Meanwhile, the V2O5 NWs act as ideal redox mediators to dynamically block polysulfide dissolution and facilitate their conversion into sulfides via formation of active intermediate polythionate complexes. Therefore, these cells with 70 wt% sulfur content in the whole cathode have significantly improved performance with a long cycling life (1000 cycles), low capacity decay (0.041% per cycle), and considerable areal capacity (>4 mA h cm(-2)), even at a high sulfur loading of 5.5 mg cm(-2). This novel interlayer design strategy has great potential for promoting the practical use of Li-S batteries.

Stabilizing Lithium-Sulfur Cells with Practical Loading and Cycling Conditions Using Li2S8-Containing Ethereal Electrolyte Solution	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						lithium sulfur cells; lithium metal anodes; lithium poly-sulfides; activated carbon fiber cloth; microporous carbon	HIGH-ENERGY; LI; BATTERIES; REDUCTION; DENSITY; ANODES	We report on stabilization of Li-S cells cycled with an areal charge/discharge capacity of 2 mAh cm(-2) at current densities of 1-2 mA cm(-2) using ethereal LiTFSI/LiNO3/DOL/DME electrolyte solution containing 0.1M Li2S8. This electrolyte solution enables stable lithium metal stripping-plating both in symmetric Li divide Li and full Li-S cells with composite binder free sulfur impregnated activated carbon fibers cathodes. The addition of Li2S8 substantially extends cycling life of these cells due to the formation of smooth non-dendritic Li metal surface protected with an effective SEI enriched with Li sulfides, sulfites and sulfates species. Symmetric Li divide Li could be cycled stably for more than 1000 h at 1-2 mA cm(-2) with Li2S8-containing electrolyte solutions. Full Li-S cells demonstrate more than 500 stable cycles (at least 3 times more than with Li2S8 free electrolyte solution) at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) and an areal capacity of 2 mAh cm(-2). The most stable cycling results were achieved for the cells cycled with discharge cut off voltage of 1.9 V preventing the depletion of LiNO3. The use of electrolyte solutions containing liquid lithium poly-sulfides makes possible considerable decrease in the amount of the electrolyte solution and increases the energy density of the cells.

Development and costs calculation of lithium-sulfur cells with high sulfur load and binder free electrodes	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur; Binder free; CNT; High sulfur load; Costs calculation	CARBON NANOTUBES; BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE	A binder free thick film sulfur cathode based on a carbon structure with carbon nano tubes (CNT) is introduced. The sulfur mass can be varied between 3 and 20 mg cm(-2) electrode leading to sulfur loads that are several times as high as in slurry electrodes. The electrode structure and thickness is examined by SEM, the surface area measured by BET and the in-plane conductivity is determined by a modified 4-point measurement. The achieved capacities for these extremely high sulfur loads are around 900 mAh g(-1) sulfur at a current of 0.64 mA cm(-2) electrode. Additionally the price of future Li-S cells (18650), both conventional sulfur slurry cathode and here introduced binder free CNT sulfur cathode were calculated and compared with a lithium-ion system (NCA-graphite).

In this work, we use environmentally friendly bacterial cellulose (BC) as the substrate and prepare a flexible Ni-containing coordination polymer-modified carbonized BC interlayer (Ni-CBC). The combined electrochemical theoretical analysis shows that Ni-CBC not only captures LiPS effectively but also facilitates the electrochemical conversion of the adsorbed LiPS. As a result of these favorable features, the battery with the Ni-CBC interlayer delivers a stable discharge performance at 0.2C during long charge-discharge cycles and a high rate capacity of 852 mAh g(-1) at 2C. This work suggests that cellulose-based materials with tailored functionality can improve the performance of Li-S batteries.

Nonetheless, to avoid the thermodynamic loss of sulfides, a stronger physical/chemical bonding displays a more effective way to mitigate the sulfur "flow away" process. In this article, we created a double-net matrix, which is composed of activated carbon (AC) embedded by a mesoporous silicon oxide cap. The oxide cap not only "traps" the sulfide molecules but also chemically bonds the molecules to delay the dissolution, resulting in high-capacity retention and improved rate performance. The capacity as high as 980 mAh/g at 0.2 C of the battery using the double-net enclosed sulfur composite as cathode was retained after 300 cycles. A high-capacity retention of 780 mAh/g after 1000 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of >99.5% was also achieved. In parallel, a wide range of sulfur ratios up to similar to 73% in the composite led to a high loading of active material, thus enabling a high energy density. The battery showed high-capacity retention after 300 cycles with the sulfur loadings of 4 and 5 mg/cm(2), respectively. The improved capability of cycling, rate, and Coulombic efficiency of Li-S battery using industry available both AC and sulfur pave the pathway in mass production as a high-energy-storage system.

Here, we employ a facile and up-scalable approach to convert discarded polystyrene foams to S,P-codoped porous carbon (SPPC) as the effective sulfur mobilizer for lithium-sulfur batteries. The high porosity of SPPC can ensure high loading of sulfur with effective physical adsorption to polysulfides, and the heteroatom codoping of sulfur and phosphorus can enhance the electrical conductivity of carbon effectively with strong chemical immobilization for polysulfides. These effects are together responsible for the superior performance of S@SPPC with a sulfur loading of 72 wt %. The S@SPPC cathode with an areal sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2) exhibits an initial capacity of 893 mA h g(-1) at 2 C with only a small capacity loss of 0.049% per cycle over 800 cycles. The cathode still exhibits both superior rate capability, and stable cycling performance for a capacity decay rate of 0.06% per cycle over 600 cycles at 2 C by increasing the areal sulfur loading to 4.8 mg cm(-2) and a capacity of 694 mA h g(-1) retained after 150 cycles for 0.5 C at a much reduced electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio of 5 mL This study offers a route for realizing the up-scalable conversion of "waste" to "treasure," which is significant for practical applications in energy storage.

Currently, rational structure designing of carbon-based sulfur hosts is the most effective strategy to address the above issues. However, the preparation process of carbon-based sulfur hosts is usually complex and costly. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an efficient and cost-effective method to fabricate carbon hosts for high-performance sulfur cathodes. Herein, we reported the fabrication of a bio-derived nitrogen doped porous carbon materials (BNPC) via a molten-salt method for high performance sulfur cathodes. The long-range-ordered honeycomb structure of BNPC is favorable for the trapping of polysulfide (PS) species and accommodates the volumetric variation of sulfur during cycling, while the high graphitization degree of BNPC favors the redox kinetics of sulfur cathodes. Moreover, the nitrogen doping content not only enhances the electrical conductivity of BNPC, but also provides ample anchoring sites for the immobilization of PS, which plays a key role in suppressing the shuttle effect. As a result, the S@ BNPC cathode exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 1189.4 mA.h/ g at 0.2C. After 300 cycles, S@ BNPC still maintains a capacity of 703.2 mA.h/ g which corresponds to a fading rate of 0.13% per cycle after the second cycle. This work offers vast opportunities for the large-scale application of high performance carbon-based sulfur hosts.

Accelerating the sluggish reaction kinetics of sulfur cathode and suppressing the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle are crucial for the high-performance Li-S batteries. Herein, we prepared the catalytic palladium nano-particles (Pd NPs) imbedded in hollow carbon spheres (Pd@HCS) as sulfur host by a sacrificial template method. Benefitting from the hollow nanostructure and strong chemisorption ability of Pd NPs, Pd@HCS can effectively mitigate the LiPS shuttling via physical and chemical pathways. Furthermore, the Pd NPs as one electrocatalyst can accelerate the redox reaction kinetics of LiPS. The theoretical calculation and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate that the moderate Pd-S bonding between Pd NPs and sulfur species are beneficial to LiPS conversion. The Pd@HCS/S electrode delivers a high initial capacity of 1306 mAh g(-1) and 885 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, as well as the good cycling stability (a slight capacity decay of 0.068% per cycle over 400 cycles at 1 C). The Pd@HCS/S cathode with the high sulfur loading of 5.88mg cm(-2) delivers an initial capacity of 873 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and good capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a MOF-driven strategy has been employed to synthesize a hierarchical architecture constructed by rooting bismuth oxide nanosheets into Co/N-co-doped porous carbon nanoboxes (Bi2O3@Co/N-PC). After a process of sulfur infiltration, the hierarchical architecture turns into a hybrid composed of sulfur embedded within the Bi2O3@Co/N-PC host (Bi2O3@Co/N-PC@S). When used as the cathode material for Li-S batteries, the as-prepared Bi2O3@Co/N-PC@S not only exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1302 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.25 C, but also maintains a capacity of 732 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at the current density of 1.5 C. Moreover, the high rate test also demonstrates its exceptional rate capability with a capacity as high as 451 mA h g(-1) after 1500 cycles at the current density of 10 C. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the high conductivity and favourable surface structure of the Co/N-doped carbon framework as well as its strong charge coupling with bismuth oxide nanosheets, resulting in low polarization, fast redox reaction kinetics, and high immobilization ability towards intermediate polysulfide.

Besides, elemental S (Se) raw materials are widely sourced and their production costs are both low, which make them considered one of the new generations of high energy density electrochemical energy storage systems with the most potential for development. However, poor conductivity of elemental S/Se and the notorious ?shuttle effect? of lithium polysulfides (polyselenides) severely hinder the commercialization of Li-S/Se batteries. Thanks to the excellent electrical conductivity and strong absorption of lithium polysulfide (polyselenide) about electronically conducting polymer, some of the above thorny problems have been effectively alleviated. The review presents the fundamental studies and current development trends of common electronically conducting polymers in various components of Li-S/Se batteries, which involves polyaniline (PANI) polypyrrole (PPy), and polythiophene (PTh) with its derivatives, e.g. polyethoxythiophene (PEDOT) and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Finally, the review not only summarizes the research directions and challenges facing the application of electronically conducting polymers, but also looks forward to the development prospects of them, which will provide a way for the practical use of electronically conducting polymers in Li-S/Se batteries with outstanding electrochemical properties in the short run. ? 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Due to the unique microstructure, as-constructed S@THC-CoSe2 cathode not only can relieve the volume expansion of active substance, but also offer a "multilayer defensive system" to prevent the outward diffusion of Li2Sn through physical and chemical interactions simultaneously. In addition, the outermost CoSe2 nanosheets with excellent electronic conductivity is able to catalyze the transformation of Li2Sn anchored on its surface, finally accelerating the elimination of soluble intermediates and weakening the shuttle phenomenon. Based on above advantages, the initial discharge capacity of the Li-S battery assembled by S@THC-CoSe2 cathode is as high as 1230.0 mAh g(-1) at the current rate of 0.1C, and the capacity attenuation of each cycle is as low as 0.034% in 1000cycles at 1.0C.

Herein, S microsphere encapsulated within a thickness-tunable multilayered thin V/V2O5 nanoshell (S@V/V2O5) was explored as a high-sulfur-content cathode (up to 93 wt%) for Li-S batteries. With a polar V2O5 moiety the nanoshell could physically block and chemically adsorb polysulfides, while the metallic V could assure efficient electron transfer; this multilayered and porous nanoshell could also buffer the volumetric variations of the sulfur core and facilitate Li+ transportation. Such S@V/V2O5 electrode with a 87 wt% sulfur content delivers high specific capacity (1403 mAh g(-1)) and remarkable areal initial capacity (4.4 mAh cm(-2)) at 0.2 C, excellent cycling stability (819 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 300 cycles), superior high-rate capacity (804 mAh g(-1) at 4 C), low self-discharge (759 mAh g(-1) after resting 50 days) and a high coulombic efficiency above 90% in a LiNO3 free electrolyte. A current collector-free S@V/V(2)O(5 )cathode with sulfur content of 93 wt% is also achieved, which yields stable discharge capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles.

To solve this critical issue, a praline-like flexible interlayer consisting of high-loading titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles and relatively long carbon nanofibers is fabricated. TiO2 nanoparticles with a size gradient occupy both the external and internal of carbon fiber and serve as anchors that allow the chemical adsorption of polysulfides through a conductive nanoarchitecture. The porous conductive carbon backbone helps in the physical absorption of polysulfides and provides redox reaction sites to allow the polysulfides to be reused. More importantly, it offers enough mechanical strength to support a high load TiO2 nanoparticle (79 wt%) that maximizes their chemical role, and can accommodate the large volume changes. Significant enhancement in cycle stability and rate capability is achieved for a readily available sulfur/multi-walled carbon nanotube composite cathode simply by incorporating this hierarchically nanostructured interlayer. The design and synthesis of interlayers by in situ integration of metal oxides and carbon fibers via a simple route offers the potential to advance Li-S batteries for practical applications in the future.

However. Li2S suffers from poor rate performance and short cycle life due to its insulating nature and polysulfide shuttle during cycling. In this work, we report a facile and viable approach to address these issues. We propose a method to synthesize a Li2S based nanocomposite cathode material by dissolving Li2S as the active material. polyvinylpyrrolidone (PM as the carbon precursor. and graphene oxide (GO) as a matrix to enhance the conductivity, followed by a coprecipitation and high-temperature carbonization process. The Li2S/rGO cathode yields an exceptionally high initial capacity of 817 mAh g(-1) based on Li 2 .3 mass at C/20 rate and also shows a good cycling performance. The carbon-coated Li2S/rGO cathode demonstrates the capability of robust core-shell nanostructures for different rates and improved capacity retention, revealing carbon coated Li2S/rGO composites as an outstanding system for highperformance lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this work, a hierarchical porous carbon fiber (HPCF) with a few mesopores and abundant micropores was prepared via electrospinning with a SiO2 template and subsequent KOH activation. The HPCF with an ultra-high surface area and a large pore volume can construct a loose network structure to promise high sulfur utilization and sufficient sulfur loading. Mesopores can provide pathways for the infiltration of electrolyte to ensure fast transport of lithium ions during electrochemical reactions, whereas micropores can effectively suppress the diffusion of polysulfides by their strong adsorption capability. Due to such advantages, the proposed cathode, with 66 wt% sulfur content, can yield a high reversible capacity of 1070.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C, and a stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 88.4% after 100 cycles.

In the present work, we have studied the potential of a benzimidazole-containing poly(arylene ether ketone) (PAEK-BI) and a sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone-co-benzimidazole) (SPAEK-BI) as bifunctional binders for high sulfur loading cathodes. Our investigation demonstrates that their use significantly improves the sulfur cathode performance with improved sulfur utilization (i.e., higher discharge capacity), reduced capacity decay, longer cycling life, and enhanced rate performance, relative to the conventional poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder. The superior performance results from the significantly higher binding strength and the valuable polysulfide trapping ability of the polymers through the sulfonate (-SO3-Li) and benzimidazole groups on the polymers. Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) simulation has verified the significantly higher binding energies between the two groups and Li2S4 than PVDF. Ex situ adsorption experiments have also confirmed the significant adsorption of Li2S4 on both polymers. At a sulfur loading of 3.5 mg cm(-2), the capacity decay rates of cathodes with PAEK-BI and SPAEK-BI are reduced to as low as 0.025% and 0.039% per cycle over 400 cycles at 0.5 C, respectively. In addition, PAEK-BI and SPAEK-BI also enable the high sulfur loading cathodes (as high as 9.1 and 7.3 mg cm(-2), respectively) with high areal capacities (2.9 mAh cm(-2) and 2.6 mAh cm(-2)) and high cycling stabilities. With their superior electrochemical performance, both polymers show strong potential for the fabrication of high sulfur loading cathodes of sound cyclic stability for practical applications.

However, lithium sulfur battery, especial the sulfur cathode, is still under experimental exploration, and the commercial carbon fiber felt is rarely reported to apply in the sulfur cathode. Herein, the flexible carbon-fiber-supported carbon-sulfur electrode was prepared, and its physical properties and electrochemical performance were characterized. The results showed that the interface resistance was reduced from 97.9 Omega to 22.6 Omega, due to porous three-dimensional network of the carbon fiber felt and micropore of the porous carbon which benefited energy density of the battery and conductivity of the sulfur cathode. Furthermore, the initial discharge capacity at 0.05C rate was 996.7 mAh/g and the discharge capacity at 2C rate after 140 cycles was 666.7 mAh/g when carbon fiber felt serves as current collector, while their counterparts with aluminum foil as the current collector were 772.9 and 471.6 mAh/g, respectively. Furthermore, the environmental-friend and low-cost binder LA132, super-P, and the ball-milling technique are beneficial to mass synthesis, suitable for the industrial production and the application of lithium sulfur battery.

However, their practical application is mainly hindered by the polysulfide shuttle and the slow redox kinetic in the electrochemical process. In this study, we prepared FeWO4 nanorods by a simple hydrothermal method to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. The FeWO4 nanomds act as catchers and electmcatalyst for polysulfide in lithium sulfur batteries. These FeWO4 nanomds could efficiently adsorb polysulfide and enhance the conduction of Li ions, leading to inhibition of the polysulfide shuttle effect and enhancement of the electrochemical reaction kinetic for cycling stability and rate performance. Density functional theory calculation shows the existence of the high binding energy between FeWO4 nanomds and polysulfide, which can limit polysulfide to the surface of FeWO(4 )nanorods. Therefore, the Li-S batteries with FeWO(4 )nanorods not only provide an initial discharge capacity of 1318 mAh g(-1) at the current of 0.8 mA with high coulombic efficiency of 97%, but also shows a capacity decay rate of 0.07% during 600 cycles at a current of 3.2 mA. With the above-mentioned dates, this work offers a promising new strategy to regulate the kinetic behaviors of polysulfide for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the practical applications of Li-S batteries are hampered by the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LPS), which results in low cycle stability. Herein, a functional interlayer has been developed to efficiently regulate the LPS and enhance the sulfur utilization using hierarchical nanostructure of C3N4 (t-C3N4) embedded with Fe3O4 nanospheres. t-C3N4 exhibits high surface area and strong anchoring of LPS, and the Fe3O4/t-C3N4 accelerates the anchoring of LPS and improves the electronic pathways. The combination of these materials leads to remarkable battery performance with 400% improvement in a specific capacity and a low capacity decay per cycle of 0.02% at 2 C over 1000 cycles, and stable cycling at 6.4 mg cm(-2) for high-sulfur-loading cathode.

However, the development of a fast approach to prepare the hollow structured particles remains challenging. Herein, a new and efficient in situ hard-template method was developed to synthesize hollow carbon nano- and microparticles using the as-prepared SiO2 particles as a hard template directly, without any separation, drying, or redispersion. In this way, the hollow carbon particles with tunable diameters and shell thickness can be synthesized readily, which is simpler and more efficient than the traditional ones. In addition, the universality of this strategy allows us to study the different behaviors of hollow carbon particles in lithium-sulfur batteries when the architectures of hollow particles (i.e., diameter, shell thickness, etc.) were changed. We believe that this in situ method is applicable for synthesizing other core-shell or hollow structured materials (e.g., metal oxide), and also, the high performance of hollow carbon particles in lithium-sulfur batteries and beyond can be further explored.

Compared with common sulfur cathodes, the cathode with chitosan shows an enhanced initial discharge capacity from 950 to 1145 mA h g(-1) at C/10. The reversible specific capacity after 100 cycles increases from 508 mA h g(-1) to 680 mA h g(-1) and 473 to 646 mA h g(-1) at rates of C/2 and 1 C, respectively. In addition, batteries with separators that are coated with a carbon/chitosan layer can exhibit a high discharge capacity of 830 mA h g(-1) at C/2 after 100 cycles and 675 mA h g(-1) at 1 C after 200 cycles with the capacity fading to as low as 0.11% per cycle. This study demonstrates the benefits of using chitosan for not only lithium-sulfur batteries but also potentially other sulfur-based battery applications.

Coupled effect of TiO2-x and N defects in pyrolytic waste plastics-derived carbon on anchoring polysulfides in the electrode of Li-S batteries	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Pyrolytic waste plastics-derived carbon; N defect; <p>TiO2-x</p>; Lithium-sulfur battery	REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; CATHODE MATERIAL; DOPED GRAPHENE; HIGH-CAPACITY; SULFUR; PERFORMANCE; HOST; SURFACE; BORON; SPECTROSCOPY	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have the potential to provide high energy density but they suffer from shuttling phenomena that are detrimental to cyclic stability in such a way that lithium polysulfides gradually diffuse out from the cathode interface. We employed the pyrolysis residue from waste plastics for a carbon source and applied it as a cathode sulfur host for Li-S batteries to limit the shuttle effect. Annealing with the aid of KOH and the subsequent ammonia thermal treatment endowed the residue with hierarchical porosity that reached 30% mesoporosity of the total pore volume. N-defects were significantly introduced in carbon networks with edge-positioned states, which helped them chemically interact with Li moieties in the polysulfides. Furthermore, titanium sub-dioxide (TiO2-x) was formed as impurities after the thermal treatment effectively suppressed diffusion of the intermediates. Based on the coupled effect of both N-defects and TiO2-x, the prepared carbon contributed to retarding the decay rate of discharge capacity, and its decay rate decreased to 0.089% per cycle at 1 C until 500 cycles with a capacity of higher than 500 mAh g(-1). This study offers a precedent for practical green design of waste plastic residues as a carbon source. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jeon, BH; Yeon, JH; Kim, KM; Chung, IJ				Jeon, BH; Yeon, JH; Kim, KM; Chung, IJ			Preparation and electrochemical properties of lithium-sulfur polymer batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						sulfur; lithium secondary battery; lithium sulfide; polymer electrolyte	ELECTROLYTES; POLYSULFIDES; REDUCTION; CELL	The lithium/sulfur (Li-S) batteries consist of a composite cathode, a polymer electrolyte, and a Lithium anode. The composite cathode is made from elemental sulfur (or Lithium sulfide), carbon black, PEO, LiClO4, and acetonitrile. The polymer electrolyte is made of gel-type linear poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. Cells based on Li2S or sulfur have open-circuit voltages of about 2.2 and 2.5 V, respectively. The former cell shows two reduction peaks and one oxidation peak. It is suggested that the first reduction peak is caused by the change from polysulfide to short lithium polysulfide, and the second reduction peak by the change from short lithium polysulfide to lithium sulfide (Li2S, Li2S2). The cell based on sulfur has the same reduction mechanism as that of Li2S, Which is caused by the multi process (first and second reduction) of lithium polysulfide. On charge-discharge cycling, the first discharge has a higher capacity than subsequent discharges and the flat discharge voltage is about 2.0 V. As the current load is increased, the discharge capacity decreases. One reason for this fading capacity and low sulfur utilization is the aggregation of sulfur (or polysulfide) with cycling.

However, incomplete understanding of their underlying operation mechanisms has hindered their further development and commercialization. To gain a better understanding of the operation mechanisms in the lithium sulfur battery, three macroscopically different (woven and nonwoven) and microscopically similar (made from the same carbon fibers) freestanding carbon felts are used as the conductive matrices to show how the macrostructure influences the redox reactions and the electrochemical performance. An operando radiography and simultaneous in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study are performed to highlight the differences of the carbon hosts and how they compare electrochemically in a lithium sulfur battery. The electrochemical results show that the carbon host with a more open structure results in increased capacity as well as a higher diffusion coefficient. The operando radiography shows that the open structures are more conducive to efficient redox reactivity in forming solid sulfur species, mostly in the form of elongated needlelike structures identified as beta-S-8, near the end of charge, which is corroborated by the impedance data. The data also reveal a "breathing" mechanism, where the polysulfides are pushed to the edges during discharge and pulled back during charge. It is also revealed that the "breathing" process is a limiting factor in the high rate performance. Overall, this study shows that there is a close relationship between the macrostructure of the carbon matrix and the electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode.

In this study, we introduce mesoporous titanium nitride microspheres to decorate the commercial separator and effectively suppress the shuttle effect. Specifically, titanium nitride improves the utilization of sulfur as an upper current collector through its strong chemical adsorption for polysulfides and high conductivity. In addition, its mesoporous spherical structure also forms a favorable physical barrier to block the diffusion of polysulfides. With this titanium nitride modified separator, the cell exhibits an excellent capacity retention ratio of 76% after 200 cycles at 0.5C. A relatively high capacity of 672 mA h g(-1) is obtained even at a high current density of 3C. These results suggest that the design of separators modified with transition metal nitride-based materials is a promising approach for developing high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this work oxygen-deficient titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been investigated as a novel functional host for Li-S batteries. Experimental and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that oxygen vacancies (V-o) help to reduce polysulfide shuttling and catalyze the redox kinetics of sulfur/polysulfides during cycling. Consequently, the resulting TiO2/S composite cathode manifests superior electrochemical properties in terms of high capacity (1472 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C), outstanding rate capability (571 mA h g(-1) at 2C), and excellent cycling properties (900 mA h g(-1) over 100 cycles at 0.2C). The present strategy offers a viable way through vacancy engineering for the design and optimization of high-performance electrodes for advanced Li-S batteries and other electrochemical devices.

The porous carbon-encapsulated sulfur composites were synthesized by a feasible melting process and used as host materials for lithium sulfur batteries. Because of the unique microporous, ultrahigh surface area and irregular wrinkled surface coexisting structure, the resulting microporous carbon/sulfur (DCMC/S) composite cathode possesses a good rate capability and long-term cycling performance. The initial discharge capacity of the DCMC2/S composite electrode with 74.3 wt% sulfur content is 1082.6 mAh g (1) at a current rate of 0.2 C. At a higher current rate of 1 C, it possesses excellent cyclic performance and retained a capacity of 422.8 mAh g (1) after 500 cycles with a low capacity fading rate of 0.11% per cycle. The coulombic efficiency remains over 98% during cycling. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, a new functional separator coating composed of pristine zirconium metal-organic framework (Co-PCN-222) with catalytic cobalt-porphyrin linker decorated carbon nanotubes (PCN@CNT) was presented for addressing this problem. Benefiting from powerful adsorption and catalytic activity of the uniformly dispersed cobalt and nitrogen sites in porphyrin linkers as well as the fast electron transport network provided by highly conductive CNT, the polysulfide redox kinetics is greatly boosted and the shuttle effect is inhibited to a large extent. Accordingly, the Li-S batteries coupling with PCN@CNT coated separator delivers a specific capacity as high as 1157 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, good rate capability with a reversible capacity of 696 mAh g(-1) under 2 C as well as excellent cyclic performance with a low average capacity attenuation rate of 0.067% upon 500 cycles at 1 C. This work will open up great opportunities in the development of pristine MOFs-based separator coating for advanced Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the anxiety is the poor affinity toward polar polysulfides due to the intrinsic nonpolar surface of carbon. Herein, we report a direct pyrolysis of the mixture urea and boric acid to synthesize B/N-codoped hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (B-N-CSs) as efficient sulfur host for lithium-sulfur battery. The graphene-like B-N-CSs provides high specific surface area and porous structure with abundant micropores (1.1 nm) and low-range mesopores (2.3 nm), thereby constraining the sulfur active materials within the pores. More importantly, the codoped B/N elements can further enhance the polysulfide confinement through strong Li-N and B-S interaction based on the Lewis acid-base theory. These structural superiorities significantly suppress the shuttle effect by both physical confinement and chemical interaction, and promote the redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion. When evaluated as the cathode host, the S/B-N-CSs composite displays the excellent performance with a high reversible capacity up to 772 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C and a low fading rate of similar to 0.09% per cycle averaged upon 500 cycles. In particular, remarkable stability with a high capacity retention of 87.1% can be realized when augmenting the sulfur loading in the cathode up to 4.6 mg cm(-2).

As coating layer, the material was systematically studied through X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrochemical test. NCNT/S(RGO-gel) electrode showed first discharge specific capacity of 1403.7 mAh.g(-1) under 500 mA/g density. The material also exhibited outstanding rate capability and long-term cycle stability. Results showed that RGO-gel coated composite electrode retained its discharge specific capacity of 912.4 mAh/g after 175 cycles under 500 mA/g current density. The composite electrode presented capacity retention rate of 80%. Improved electrochemical performance was mainly ascribed to RGO-gel, which not only reduced dissolution of sulfur polymer (S-n(2-)) but also significantly improved conductivity. NCNT also served as bridge between RGO-gel layers, significantly shortening the path for lithium-ion transport. Thus, novel NCNT/S(RGO-gel) composite can act as potential positive electrode for high performance Li-S batteries.

In this contribution, few-layered MoS2 nanosheets as electrocatalysts are introduced into the Li-S system by developing a novel sandwich-type MoS2/sulfur/reduced graphene oxide (MoS2/S/rGO) composite cathode. The sandwiched sulfur film has a synergistic coupling effect with both the MoS2 electrocatalyst layer and the conductive rGO substrate, enabling a robust hybrid structure with strong interfacial interactions for physical entrapment of intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) during cycling. More importantly, the MoS2 electrocatalysts are bifunctional in regulating sulfur reaction chemistry, and could chemically immobilize LiPSs via Li-S bonds and also kinetically accelerate sulfur redox reactions, especially for the mutual conversions between soluble LiPSs and solid Li2S2/Li2S. These merits with regard to structure and chemistry enable the MoS2/S/rGO cathode with superior rate capability (reversible capacities of 657 and 553 mA h g(-1) at high rates of 7 and 10C, respectively), and long-term cycling stability (a slow capacity decay of 0.037% per cycle at 2C over 1000 cycles). This work provides a new pathway to establish a multifaceted cathode structure by rationally integrating the concepts of physical confinement, chemical adsorption and electrocatalysis for advanced Li-S batteries.

The as-prepared samples were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray powder diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The MoS2-decorated carbon aerogel (CA) with carbon nanotube as fine wire presents narrow distribution of pore size, interconnected structure and high conductance. The MoS2/CNCA/S composites exhibit improved electrochemical performances as cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries. Especially, the MoS2-8/CNCA/S composite delivers a discharge capacity of 1343 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C with the capacity retention of 81% after 200 cycles. Even at 5 C, the electrode presents high discharge capacity of 723 mAh g(-1). These improved results can be attributed to the contribution of entangled network as electronic conductive channel, large surface area, small pore size and special anchoring action of molybdenum disulfide.

Herein, spinel ZnCo2O4 porous particles@N-doped reduced graphene oxide (ZnCo2O4@N-RGO) are prepared via the combined procedures of refluxing and hydrothermal treatment, consisting of interconnected uniform ZnCo2O4 nanocubes with an average size of 5 nm anchored on graphene nanosheets. The as-obtained composite can act as an inimitable cathode scaffold to suppress the shuttling of polysulfides by chemical confinement of ZnCo2O4 and N-RGO for the first time, as demonstrated by the adsorption energy of ZnCo2O4 to Li2S4 via the strong chemical bonding between Zn or Co and S. The RGO nanosheets with a relatively high specific surface area provide a good conductive network and structural stability. The introduction of doped N atoms and numerous ZnCo2O4 porous nanoparticles can inhibit the transfer of lithium polysulfides between the cathode and anode. Due to the unique structural and compositional features, the as-obtained hybrid materials with the high sulfur loading of 71% and even 82% still deliver high specific capacity, good rate capability, and enhanced cycling stability with exceptionally high initial Coulombic efficiency, which displays a high utilization of sulfur.

Herein, adopting ZIF-8@ZIF-67 core-shell nanocrystals derived double-shelled hollow N-doped porous carbon polyhedrons (DSxHNC) as the main component, ketjen black (KB) as the conductive modifier and structural filler, and hydrogen as the shell tailor, a potent polysulfides barrier is developed to inhibit LiPSs shuttling by forming light-weight, thin and dual-functional interlayer onto commercialized polypropylene separator (PPS) via simple doctor blade coating with negative-pressure infiltration. This method well addresses the uneven accumulation and easy exfoliation of DSxHNC, and simultaneously optimizes the densification of interlayer. Owing to the physically/chemically synergistic adsorption toward LiPSs, the cell using DS145HNC/KB@PPS with an interlayer of 8.43 mu m (thickness) and 0.4864 mg cm(-2) (mass loading) delivers prominent cycling life with a capacity degradation of 0.067% per cycle (500 cycles) at 1 C based on low sulfur content (1.0 mg cm(-2)) cathode and a high capacity retention of 80% (100 cycles) at 0.2 C based on high sulfur content (3.1 mg cm(-2)) cathode, separately. This work shares a novel strategy for the synthesis of light-weight, thin and dual-functional interlayer onto PPS for high-performance LSBs.

Using small sulfur molecules (S2-4), in place of conventional cyclo-S-8, as cathode materials is an efficient method to fundamentally eradicate the shuttle effect. To satisfy the demands of flexible electronic devices, in this paper, two-dimensional (2D) MXene nanosheets were used as a conductive binder and flexible backbone to combine with the S2-4/carbon composite, fabricating a flexible small-sulfur electrode for lithium-sulfur batteries. The 2D MXene nanosheets with excellent conductivity can not only provide flexibility for the electrode, but also construct a conductive network for fast charge transfer. As a result, the flexible S2-4 electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performance, which has a capacity of 1029.7 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintains 946.7 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles with 91.9% retention. Besides, a capacity of 502.3 mA h g(-1) is obtained at 2 C current density. This electrode is promising for flexible lithium-sulfur batteries, and the application of MXene as a conductive binder and flexible backbone in lithium-sulfur batteries offers an effective method to achieve both flexibility and high performance.

Therefore, the development of conductive electrode architectures with novel, porous structures is essential to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S cells. To this end, carbon inverse opals (IOs) were prepared using sacrificial polystyrene spheres, directly on a current-collecting substrate, and were infilled with sulfur via a solution infiltration method. The electrochemical performance of S-infilled carbon IOs (S-CIO), prepared with spheres of different diameters, is evaluated through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. We demonstrate that S-CIO provide long cycle life and stable specific charge, when tested as cathode materials for Li-S batteries. IO samples, prepared with smaller spheres (100 and 200 nm diameters), achieve significantly higher specific charge values than samples prepared with larger spheres. The electrochemical performance of our S-CIO is compared with conventional slurry electrodes containing CIO powder. Mechanical stress during slurry preparation, grinding or ball-milling of material, destroys the IO structure, resulting in worse electrochemical performance as compared to as deposited IO samples. Consequently, this report offers insight into the importance of retaining and optimizing the structure of conductive S-hosts for improving electrochemical performance of Li-S cells.

Herein, we propose to improve the performance of the sulfur cathode by introducing a built-in carbon nanotube network inside a biomass-derived hierarchically porous carbon for the subsequent sulfur loading. This balanced structural design of the carbon substrate enables effective trapping of active sulfur within the cathode and provides a highly efficient pathway for electron transmission, contributing to an increased conductivity and structural integrity of the cathode. By using a potentiostatic process at the end of charge, the reversibility of the electrode reaction of sulfur is improved. The sulfur cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1739 mA hg(-1) and reaches a high initial Columbic efficiency of 87.6 %, and maintains its efficiency to >97.5% from the 2nd cycle. It also shows admirable cycling and rate performance.

The resulting deposition of polysulfide species reduces the conductivity of the metallic Li electrode and the quantity of active material. Here, we demonstrate pronounced suppression of polysulfide shuttle using a sulfide-impermeable glass-ceramic membrane, which is employed as separator between the positive and negative electrodes. As a result, highly stable Li-S electrochemistry occurs in the sulfur-dissolving tetrahydrofuran catholyte solution, which provides good capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency for cycling. This demonstration holds promise for practical next-generation batteries with marked reversibility and the possibility to increase the energy density when equipped with a catholyte flow-through mode.

However, the obstacle mainly originating from the sluggish conversion kinetics between the soluble lithium polysulfide immediate and S/Li2S/Li2S2 results in lithium sulfur batteries with low sulfur usage and coulombic efficiency, poor cycling, and rate performance. In this work, a new cathode host material with cobalt disulfide nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxides (GOs) has been designed to enhance the interactive affinity to lithium polysulfide and accelerate polysulfide conversion more effectively. With the implementation of these metal chalcogenides, a sulfur cathode with low polarization, stable cycling performance, and high rate capability is obtained. Moreover, this work offers solid evidence from the post mortem analysis of symmetric cells such as SEM and XPS, confirming the origin of the catalytic effects from cobalt disulfide nanocrystals wrapped with reduced GOs in a sulfur battery.

Effect of silicon dioxide in sulfur/carbon black composite as a cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries	VACUUM			English	Article						Energy storage; Specific capacity; Cathode; Shuttle effect	ENHANCED ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; CARBON; HOST; POLYSULFIDES; ELECTRODES; RETENTION; PARTICLES; STRATEGY; BINDER	Lithium-sulfur battery has been recognized as the most promising alternative for energy storage, because of its high theoretical specific capacity and natural abundance. However, owing to the shuttle effect of polysulfides, which leads to the poor cycle life and limits the practical use of Li-S batteries. Despite many endeavours in joining sulfur with porous carbon matrix to suppress the polysulfide dissolution, relatively little considerations have been done on silica, but it has a significant role in polysulfide adsorption. Herein, an effective strategy is applied to limit the polysulfide dissolution by using different ratios of sulfur/silicon dioxide/carbon black (S/SiO2/CB) composite as the cathode material for Li-S battery. The initial specific capacity of S/SiO2/CB (7:2:1) composite is 1184 mAh g(-1) and it maintains a 736 mAh g(-1) after the 50th cycle at 0.1 C. The better electrochemical performance is mainly due to the introduction of high content of SiO2 in 7:2:1 composite, in addition to that, the composite contributes to the reduction of the shuttle effect of polysulfides during the cycling process. In this study, S/SiO2/CB composite exhibits the appreciable capacity without changing its properties.

It is worthwhile to develop new strategies aiming at solving this problem. In this work, we have proved that by blocking the sulfur diffusing paths on the host materials, soluble polysulfides can be hold back to diminish their dissolution into electrolyte. In a case study, through simply coating polypyrrole (PPy) on the sulfur loaded hollow carbon spheres (HCSs) and blocking the micro tunnels on their shell, the high-performance cathode of PPy superset of HCSs superset of S has been achieved with a reversible capacity of 840 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles.

The microstructure and morphology of the sulfur/carbon composites are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is demonstrated that commercial carbon black and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the hybrid substrate cooperate well with each other in an appropriate mass ratio. In particular, a large sulfur content of 81.7 wt% can be loaded into the hybrid carbon substrate forming the sulfur/carbon composite. When the mass ratio of carbon black and CNTs is 1 : 1, the composite delivers a high initial capacity of 837.3 and 685.9 mA h g(-1)(composite) at the current densities of 80 and 160 mA g(-1)(composite) when used as a cathode-active material. The discharge capacity remains at 554.4 mA h g(-1)(composite) at a current density of 160 mA g(-1)(composite) after 150 cycles, indicating a low capacity fading of about 0.12% per cycle. Besides, the composite offers a high Coulombic efficiency of about 100%. The significant improvements in the electrochemical performance are associated with the desirable combination of carbon black and CNTs in the hybrid carbon substrate. Therefore, this work proposes a low-cost and effortless approach to prepare sulfur/carbon composites with high performance as cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Structural change of sulfur cathode during discharge and charge	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							POLYSULFIDES	In this paper, the structural change of the sulfur cathode during the electrochemical reaction of a lithium sulfur battery employing 0.5 M LiCF3SO3-tetra(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (TEGDME) was studied by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and wave dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). The discharge process of the lithium sulfur cell could be divided in the first discharge region (2.4- 2.1 V) where the reduction of elemental sulfur to form soluble polysulfides and further reduction of the soluble polysulfide occur, and the second discharge region (2.1-1.5V) where the soluble polysulfides are reduced to form a nonuniform Li2S solid film covered over the carbon matrix. It was also found that the charge of lithium sulfur cell leads to the conversion from Li2S to the soluble polysulfide, resulting in the removal of Li2S layer formed on carbon matrix. However, the oxidization of the soluble polysulfide to solid sulfur hardly occurs and few Li2S are left on carbon matrix even at 100% depth of charge. (C) 2003 The Electrochemical Society.

The Li2S8 polysulfide was prepared by stirring Li2S and elemental sulfur in a 1:1 mixture of dioxolane/dimethoxyethane heated at 80 degrees C. The mixture of polysulfides was tested in a lithium metal cell. The working electrode was a mixture of Ketjenblack carbon (used as conductive filler) and PTFE. It was found the Li2S8 polysulfide immediately converts into Li2S4 and sulfur when added to the electrolyte solution. The electrochemical tests showed that the cell retains excellent Coulombic efficiency and good cycling stability. The potential window used during the electrochemical tests plays an important role on the cell performance in terms of stability and capacity. An improvement of more than 500 mAh g(-1) in the specific capacity retention was observed when the potential window was reduced from 3.0-1.5 V to 2.8-1.7 V. Post mortem SEM and EDS analyses confirmed that not only the surface but the whole of the working electrode participates to the electrochemical reaction.

Such an enhanced performance is ascribed to: (i) the boron species in B-rGO can enhance the binding with polysulfides, which helps suppress the shuttle reactions, thus alleviating overcharge and self-discharge; (ii) a certain amount of the boron doped into the graphene matrix can improve the electrical conductivity of the coating layer, thus enhancing the utilization of sulfur and improving the rate performance of the cells. With the B-rGO coated separator, the severe self-discharge of Li-S batteries can be alleviated. More importantly, for the high sulfur loading cathodes (above 4.5 mg cm(-2)), an improved high areal capacity of 4.71 mA h cm(-2) can be achieved using the B-rGO coated separator. The above results demonstrate the potential of the B-rGO coated separator for practical lithium-sulfur batteries, and such a strategy can be extended to other energy storage systems.

Introducing catalysts into lithium-sulfur battery systems is a feasible and imperative strategy to tackle this problem. Previous research studies have mainly been focused on selecting new catalysts and design functional structures to improve performance, and ignoring the interaction between catalysts and their carriers. Herein, by simply fabricating a high-efficiency ZnS quantum dot@graphene nanosheet catalyst (ZnS QD@rGO), we utilized enhanced interfacial electronic interaction to accelerate polysulfide conversion for high energy density Li-S batteries. With the smaller size of ZnS, the interfacial electronic interaction becomes more enhanced, which was evidenced by DFT calculations and XPS experiments. After mixing with sulfur, the electrodes achieved a high capacity of 857.8 mA h g(-1)at 1 C and a retention of 91.2% after 300 cycles. Also, a sulfur cathode with a high actual capacity of similar to 4.0 mA h cm(-2)could be obtained, with no obvious capacity decay within 100 cycles. We believe that this strategy represents a new perspective on designing efficient high-load electrodes for Li-S batteries.

This study introduces nitrogen-rich and hierarchical porous carbon fibers in the form of a free-standing carbon paper synthesized by NaBH4-aided electrospinning and subsequent CO2 annealing. This modified process leads to a large mesopore volume of 1.007 cm(3) g(-1) and exposes the nitrogen inside the polymer to the surface of the fiber, resulting in the outstanding surface nitrogen content of 19.38 wt% with abundant pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N of 16.24 wt% in total surface atoms, while eliminating any further treatment for increasing porosity or coating the polar active sites. The resultant material impregnated by sulfur and filtered by a graphene solution is directly employed as a cathode without any additives. As a result, the capacity is maintained at 696 mAh g(-1) up to the 500th cycle at 0.2 C, and 645 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 5.0 C. Even with a high sulfur loading of 6.11 mg cm(-2), a remarkable areal capacity of 3.09 mAh cm(-2) is recorded after 500 cycles at 0.2 C with the free-standing form preserved. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its commercial applications have been hampered due to the insulating nature of sulfur and the poor cycling stability caused by the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon. In this work, we show that Li-S batteries with a mesoporous carbon interlayer placed between the separator and the sulfur cathode not only reduces the internal resistance of the cells but also that its intrinsic mesoporosity provides a physical place for trapping soluble polysulfides as well as to alleviate the negative impact of the large volume change of sulfur. This improvement of the active material reutilization allows one to obtain a stable capacity of 1015 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C after 200 cycles despite the use of a conventional sulfur-carbon black mixture as cathode. Furthermore, we observe an excellent capacity retention (similar to 0.1% loss per cycle, after the second cycle), thus making one step closer toward feasible Li-S battery technology for applications in electric vehicles and grid-scale stationary energy storage systems.

Herein, we demonstrated a sustainable and proficient strategy to synthesize a unique and cost-effective tremella-like nitrogen-doped microporous carbon (TNMC) materials derived from housefly larvae. The key feature of TNMC is that it possesses interconnected 3D channels with voids, high surface area (>1000 m(2) g(-1)) along with large volume (0.62 m(3) g(-1)). Particularly, a high portion of ultra-micropore and the predominant pore width of similar to 0.54 nm play important roles in confining the metastable small sulfur molecules (S2-4) physically. More importantly, TNMCs with sufficient nitrogen doping (6-8 wt%) not only improve the conductivity of sulfur electrode materials but also act as an active site for adsorbing S2-4 chemically and reducing the shuttle effect efficiently. Beneficial from the unique 3D microstructures with ultra-micropore and inherent nitrogen doping, the resultant LSBs show high reversible capacity with a stable Coulombic efficiency.

Li2S nano spheres anchored to single-layered graphene as a high-performance cathode material for lithium/sulfur cells	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Lithium batteries; Energy storage; Sulfur; Lithium sulfide; Graphene; Carbon coating	HOLLOW CARBON NANOFIBERS; SULFUR BATTERIES; HIGH-CAPACITY; RECHARGEABLE BATTERY; LONG-LIFE; ION; ELECTRODE; DISCHARGE; REDUCTION; PARTICLES	Fully lithiated lithium sulfide (Li2S) has become a promising cathode material for Li/S cells due to its high theoretic capacity (1166 mA h g(-1)) and specific energy (2600 W h kg(-1)). However, low utilization of sulfur and poor rate capability still hinder the practical application of Li/S cells. In this paper, a carbon coated Li2S/graphene composite (Li2S/G@C) was developed by incorporating Li2S nano spheres with single-layered graphene and further forming a durable protective carbon layer on the surface of the Li2S particles using a facile CVD method. The high rate capability and remarkable cycle life of the Li2S/G@C cathode were demonstrated, which was mainly attributed to the unique structure of the Li2S/G@C that can significantly improve not only the electrical conductivity, but also the mechanical stability of the sulfur cathode.

Improving the cycling stability of S cathodes requires immobilizing the lithium polysulfide (LPS) intermediates as well as accelerating their redox kinetics. Although many materials have been explored for trapping LPS, the ability to promote LPS redox has attracted much less attention. Here, we report for the first time on transition metal phosphides as effective host materials to enhance both LPS adsorption and redox. Integrating MoP-nanoparticle-decorated carbon nanotubes with S deposited on graphene oxide, we enable Li-S battery cathodes with substantially improved cycling stability and rate capability. Capacity decay rates as low as 0.017% per cycle over 1,000 cycles can be realized. Stable and high areal capacity (> 3 mAh.cm(-2)) can be achieved under high mass loading conditions. Comparable electrochemical performance can also be achieved with analogous material structures based on CoP, demonstrating the potential of metal phosphides for long-cycle Li-S batteries.

However, the low energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries cannot fulfill their high capacity requirement. Therefore, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high theoretical capacity and energy density have attracted attention as new-generation energy storage devices. In this work, we designed a freestanding poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-coated diamond-shaped sulfur (D-sulfur)/ single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) composite cathode. The conductive PEDOT and SWCNTs effectively confined the dissolution of lithium polysulfides, and a flexible network was successfully fabricated. The D-sulfur/SWCNT composite cathode exhibited a high capacity and stable cycling performance. The initial discharge capacity reached 1520 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, and the capacity retention was 76% after 250 cycles at 0.5C. Furthermore, the D-sulfur/SWCNT was used as a flexible cathode to fabricate a prototype of a flexible Li-S battery, which shows its potential application in flexible integrated systems.

Herein, ZnS nanospheres serve as scaffold and sulfur source for the formation of 3D graphene frameworks and their subsequent conversion into sulfur through a facile oxidation reaction. Our self-template conversion route for in situ encapsulation of sulfur inside a carbon shell can prevent the aggregation of sulfur and effectively control uniformity. Hollow carbon nanostructure offers an internal void space, which can accommodate the volumetric change in sulfur upon lithiation. N-doped carbon shell serves as a physical barrier and offers active sites for the chemical adsorption of polysulfides, thereby effectively alleviating the loss of polysulfides. In addition, graphene introduction in the construction of a 3D conductive network interconnected with different S@NHC spheres under plane-to-point mode is beneficial to the continuous transfer of electrons in different dimensions. Consequently, the conductivity of the whole electrode increases. Given these advantages, S@NHC-GFW can serve as a cathode with a good rate capability and an excellent long-term cycling stability.

Here, we address the dilemma by exploiting a solvent-swollen polymeric single-ion conductor (SPSIC) as the electrolyte medium of the Li-S battery. The SPSIC consisting of a polymeric single-ion conductor and lithium salt-free organic solvents provides Li ion hopping by forming a nanoscale conducting channel and suppresses PS shuttle according to the Donnan exclusion principle when being employed for Li-S batteries. The organic solvents at the interface of the sulfur/carbon composite and SPSIC eliminate the poor interfacial contact and function as a soluble PS reservoir for maintaining the liquid-solid mechanism. Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state SPSIC allows the fabrication of a bipolar-type stack, which promises the realization of a high-voltage and energy-dense Li-S battery.

However, the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and the shuttle effect of polysulfides remain important technical obstacles in the practical use of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). This work employed a glass fiber separator with sulfonated carbon nanoparticles (SCNPs) to reduce the shuttle effect. The negatively charged sulfonic groups in SCNPs might prevent polysulfide migration and anchor lithium polysulfides. By using carbon-based interlayers, this method improves ion conductivity. Furthermore, the equally scattered sulfonic groups serve as active sites, causing sulfur to be distributed consistently and limiting sulfur growth while enhancing active sulfur utilization. After 200 cycles at 1C, the SCNP separator-containing cell showed a specific capacity of 1080 mA h g(-1). After 200 cycles, the cell with a CNP separator only showed a specific capacity of 854 mA h g(-1), demonstrating that CNPs' polysulfide diffusion suppression was ineffective. The cell with the SCNP separator still showed a high capacity of 901 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles, with an average coulombic efficiency of almost 98%.

Herein, we report Co(OH)(2) as a new stabilizer for the sulfur cathode by constructing a cobalt hydroxide-covered sulfur/conductive carbon black (CCB) electrode with the help of thermal and hydrothermal treatments. In this composite, (Co(OH)(2)@S/CCB), the sublimed sulfur is anchored in the CCB, followed by a uniform coating of Co(OH) 2 nanosheets. As cathode materials of lithium-sulfur batteries, the as-prepared Co(OH)(2)@S/CCB electrode exhibits remarkable electrochemical performances with a high capacity of 1026 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)) and 829 mA h g(-1) at 1C. Moreover, it maintains high coulombic efficiencies above 97% after 200 cycles at 1C, much higher than those of the S/CCB counterpart electrode (85%). After 200 cycles at 1C, a high capacity retention of 71.2% is obtained, better than that of the S/CCB electrode (20.2%). The enhanced performance is mainly due to the Co(OH)(2) layer which helps to inhibit the shuttle diffusion of polysulfides, resulting in improved capacity retention and cycling life.

Composite materials of ultra-light carbon and polar metal compounds are usually used as sulfur host materials, but they can lead to the low volumetric energy density of resulting Li-S batteries. Herein a lightweight 3D free-standing aerogel consisting of N-doped reduced graphene oxide modified by Co4N nanoparticles (3DNG-Co4N) are designed and synthesized, making full use of the superior electrical conductivity of the 3D network structure and the excellent adsorption capacity and catalytic activity of Co4N nanoparticles on polysulfides. The 3DNG-Co4N/S cathodes with ultrahigh sulfur loading of 24.0 mg cm(-2) pressed at 20 MPa achieves a high areal capacity of 21.8 mAh cm(-2) and volumetric energy density of 2678.1 Wh L-1 at 2.0 mA cm(-2) with an electrolyte sulfur ratio as low as 3.3 mu L mg(-1), which are among the best results in Li-S batteries. This work provides an effective strategy to design high volumetric energy density Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Andreas			Ultramicroporous carbon aerogels encapsulating sulfur as the cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article								Highly porous carbon materials employed in sulfur cathodes are of utmost importance to the charge transport, conductivity and stability of the cathode in metal-sulfur batteries. Herein, ultramicroporous carbon aerogels as conductive matrices embedding sulfur for cathode application in lithium-sulfur batteries are synthesized and investigated. Resulting from organic resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogels, the synthesized carbon aerogels feature a highly porous structure with a surface area of 500-2000 m(2) g(-1) and large micropore volume up to 0.6 cm(3) g(-1). The effective gas-phase sulfur infiltration of the carbon aerogels and the resulting confinement of sulfur in the micropores are demonstrated. It is indicated that sulfur-infiltrated microporous carbon aerogel cathodes are able to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect, maintaining 80% (>= 1000 mA h g((S))(-1)) and 70% (>= 800 mA h g((S))(-1)) of the initial discharge capacity after 200 cycles at a rate of 0.3C in carbonate and ether-based electrolytes, respectively. Remarkably, the herein prepared composite cathode can still deliver a discharge capacity of at least 700 mA h g((S))(-1) at a faster rate of 2C in both electrolyte systems. The cyclability and compatibility of the ether and carbonate-based electrolytes with such a composite cathode are discussed elaborately.

The samples were analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We proved that it is more effective to introduce the sulfur into the pores of porous carbon at 300 A degrees C than at 155 A degrees C. Especially, the porous carbon/sulfur composite heated in a sealed reactor at 300 A degrees C for 8 h presents a fine sulfur load with sulfur content of 78 wt.% and exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance. The discharge capacity is 760, 727, 744, 713, and 575 mAh g(-1) of sulfur at a current density of 80, 160, 320, 800, and 1,600 mA g(-1) based on the sulfur/carbon composite, respectively. What is more, there is almost no decay at the current density of 800 mA g(-1) for 50 cycles and coulombic efficiency remains over 95 %.

However, their practical applications are still hindered by the fast capacity decay and poor cycling stability. In this work, a sulfur host based on MOF-derived cobalt-graphitic carbon nanocages is prepared by annealing the MOF (ZIF-67) in a H-2/Ar atmosphere. This unique structure can provide both the physical encapsulation of polysulfides by the graphitic carbon shell and chemical entrapment of polysulfides by the Co nanoparticles embedded in the carbon shell. In addition, the nanocages with inner void space not only allow a relatively higher loading content of sulfur but also alleviate the volume expansion of sulfur upon lithiation. As a result, the GC-Co electrodes with a high sulfur loading content of 77 wt% display a high specific capacity at different current densities and long-term cycling performance of 500 cycles at 1C with an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.015% per cycle.

Scanning electron microscopy reveals Fe2O3-arc has a granular morphology and the crystal size can be controlled below 100 nm. X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectrums show that Fe2O3-arc displays obvious confusion, but continues to have a typical Fe2O3 crystal structure with preferentially growing on the (110) crystal plane. After sulfur loading, stable physical entrapment and chemical interaction can be established between sulfur and Fe2O3-arc matrix. The electrochemical test indicates the sulfur composite cathode with Fe2O3-arc as matrix at the loading mass ratio to 1:3 has a stable and conventional sulfur electrochemical process. The initial discharge specific capacities can achieve 720.59, 653.79 and 540.32 mAh.g(-1) at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 C current rates, respectively.

The anchoring performance of newly fabricated porous triphenylene-graphdiyne (TPGDY), boron-graphdiyne (BGDY), and nitrogen-graphdiyne (NDGY-C18N6, NGDY-C24N4, and NGDY-C36N6) monolayers are studied by employing density functional theory (DFT). It is found that the porous graphdiyne-based materials offer more space to accommodate lithium polysulfides with moderate adsorption energies and the anchoring performance changes with substrate and the size of Li2Sn molecules: BGDY has a strong chemical interaction with lithium polysulfides due to the large charge transfer as compared to others. The chemical interaction dominates in anchoring species Li2Sn with small size (n = 1, 2), whereas vdW interaction dominates for S8 and larger size Li2Sn (n = 6, 8) species. Furthermore, anchoring lithium polysulfides reduces the band gaps of the graphdiyne-based materials and enhances the electronic conductivity. These intriguing features suggest that graphdiyne-based porous 2D structures are promising anchoring materials for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Modulation of the separator-electrolyte interface through separator modification is a promising strategy to inhibit polysulfide shuttling. In this work, we develop a graphene oxide and ferrocene comodified polypropylene separator with multifunctionality at the separator-electrolyte interface. The graphene oxide on the functionalized separator could physically adsorb the polysulfide while the ferrocene component could effectively facilitate the conversion of the adsorbed polysulfide. Due to the combination of these beneficial functionalities, the separator exhibits an excellent battery performance, with a high reversible capacity of 409 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.2 C. We anticipate that the combinatorial separator functionalization proposed herein is an effective approach for improving the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we report on an effective strategy to tune surface functional groups and porous structure of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) to efficiently anchor polysulfides for high-performance Li-S batteries. Tannic acid (TA) tuned Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 (ZIF-67) could create uniformly polar sites for in-situ polysulfide absorption, and C-S and Co-S abundantly functional groups for chemically trapping polysulfides for achieving stable cycling performance. Furthermore, TA tuned ZIF-67 polyhedrons can be sculptured to a core/shell hierarchical porous structure. Foremost, the functionalized polar hydroxyl groups can undergo redox reaction with long polysulfides to form thiosulfate and short insoluble polysulfides, relieving the shuttle effect. ZIF-67-5-S cathode exhibits superior cycling stability and rate capability, showing a steady capacity of at 521 mAh/g after 550 cycles under a current density of 500 mA/g, still maintaining a capacity of 510 mAh/g even at a current density of 1600 mAh/g. The TA polymer etching MOFs route to tune core-shell hierarchically pores and abundantly functional groups offers a potential use in high energy Li-S batteries. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we proposed a vapor growth carbon fiber/polypyrrole (VGCF/PPY) dual functional separator, which can increase the conductivity by VGCF and absorb polysulfide by PPY. Finally, the VGCF/PPY functional separator displays an initial discharge specific capacity of 1085 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. The capacity remains at 768 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles with a capacity decay of 0.146% per cycle, showing excellent cycle stability. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode, however, is substantially compromised because of fast capacity decay caused by polysulfide dissolution/shuttling and low specific capacity caused by the poor electrical conductivities of the active materials. Herein we demonstrate a novel strategy to address these two problems by designing and synthesizing a carbon nanotube (CNT)/NiFe2O4 S ternary hybrid material structure. In this unique material architecture, each component synergistically serves a specific purpose: The porous CNT network provides fast electron conduction paths and structural stability. The NiFe2O4 nanosheets afford strong binding sites for trapping polysulfide intermediates. The fine S nanopartides well-distributed on the CNT/NiFe2O4 scaffold facilitate fast Li+ storage and release for energy delivery. The hybrid material exhibits balanced high performance with respect to specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability with outstandingly high Coulombic efficiency. Reversible specific capacities of 1350 and 900 mAh g(-1) are achieved at rates of 0.1 and 1 degrees C respectively, together with an unprecedented cycling stability of similar to 0.009% capacity decay per cycle over more than SOO cycles.

Vasant			Advanced Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Bio-Inspired Polysulfide Adsorptive Brush	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article							PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; CYCLE; MECHANISM; DISCHARGE; SHUTTLE; ANODE	Issues with the dissolution and diffusion of polysulfides in liquid organic electrolytes hinder the advance of lithium-sulfur batteries for next-generation energy storage. To trap and re-utilize the polysulfides without hampering lithium ion conductivity, a bio-inspired, brush-like interlayer consisting of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires and interconnected conductive frameworks is proposed. The chemical effect of ZnO on capturing polysulfides has been conceptually confirmed, initially by using a commercially available macroporous nickel foam as a conductive backbone, which is then replaced by a free-standing, ultra-light micro/mesoporous carbon (C) nanofiber mat for practical application. Having a high sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2), the sulfur/multi-walled carbon nanotube composite cathode with a ZnO/C interlayer exhibits a reversible capacity of 776 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1C with only 0.05% average capacity loss per cycle. A good cycle performance at a high rate can be mainly attributed to the strong chemical bonding between ZnO and polysulfides, fast electron transfer, and an optimized ion diffusion path arising from a well-organized nanoarchitecture. These results herald a new approach to advanced lithium-sulfur batteries using brush-like chemi-functional interlayers.

However, it is still challenging to achieve high sulfur loading and high areal capacity in the cathodes. Herein, we design a composite of carbon-wrapped Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles grown in a carbonized melamine sponge (Fe/Fe3C@N-CNT) as a free-standing conductive framework and host scaffold for sulfur loading. High sulfur content up to 86.9 wt% and overall mass loading as high as similar to 14.44 mg cm(-2) are achieved in the resultant Fe/Fe3C@N-CNT/S composite. A high discharge capacity of 1359 mA h g(-1) is delivered for this Fe/Fe3C@N-CNT/S composite at 0.1C, and 561 mA h g(-1) is retained after 150 cycles. The high electrochemical performance of this Fe/Fe3C@N-CNT/S composite is attributed to the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles, carbon coating, and N-doped carbon nanotubes in the Fe/Fe3C@N-CNT cathode.

The PVK in the composites plays multiple roles in different processes. In preparation processes, PVK functions as dispersants to prevent sulfur particles from aggregating into excessively large size. And in the cycling test, PVK could play as additional electroactive binders and barriers to reinforce the electrode stability, accommodate volume change and reduce polysulfides shuttling. The resulting PVK/S@RGO composites containing 71 wt % sulfur exhibit excellent cycling performance and rate properties with a high discharge capacity of 843.5 mA h g(-1) and a charge capacity retention of 77% (only 0.07% capacity degradation per cycle) from 20th to 400th at 1 C, corresponding to an average Coulombic efficiency of over 94%.

However, their practical application is still hindered by the unsatisfactory cyclability and slow reaction kinetics. Here, we propose a conductive oxide-based macro-microporous framework, where ZIF-8-derived N-doped carbon (NC) nanocages are embedded within the three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) V-doped ZnO matrix, as a high-performance sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The unique framework provides large surface area and high porosity for sulfur accommodation, while the V-doped ZnO skeleton enables a highly conducive substrate for electrochemical reactions. More importantly, such hybrid structure imposes strong fixation and effective catalysis of polysulfides, rendering reversible and rapid sulfur redox reactions. Due to these synergistic effects, the 3DOM NC@V-ZnO/S cathode exhibits an excellent cycling stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.043 % per cycle during 500 cycles at 1C and a good rate capability of 767.6 mAh g(-1) at 3C. Moreover, a high initial areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm(-2) was also achieved under a high sulfur loading of 5.8 mg cm(-2) with a low E/S ratio of 4.4 mu L m(-1) in coin cells, as well as decent flexibility and stable cycling in Li-S pouch cell configuration.

J	Schneider, A; Janek, J; Brezesinski, T				Schneider, Artur; Janek, Juergen; Brezesinski, Torsten			Improving the capacity of lithium-sulfur batteries by tailoring the polysulfide adsorption efficiency of hierarchical oxygen/nitrogen-functionalized carbon host materials	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							ENERGY DENSITY; CATHODE; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; ARCHITECTURE; COMPOSITES; MECHANISM; LEVEL	The use of monolithic carbons with structural hierarchy and varying amounts of nitrogen and oxygen functionalities as sulfur host materials in high-loading lithium-sulfur cells is reported. The primary focus is on the strength of the polysulfide/ carbon interaction with the goal of assessing the effect of (surface) dopant concentration on cathode performance. The adsorption capacity - which is a measure of the interaction strength between the intermediate lithium polysulfide species and the carbon - was found to scale almost linearly with the nitrogen level. Likewise, the discharge capacity of lithium-sulfur cells increased linearly. This positive correlation can be explained by the favorable effect of nitrogen on both the chemical and electronic properties of the carbon host. The incorporation of additional oxygen-containing surface groups into highly nitrogen-functionalized carbon helped to further enhance the polysulfide adsorption efficiency, and therefore the reversible cell capacity. Overall, the areal capacity could be increased by almost 70% to around 3 mA h cm(-2). We believe that the design parameters described here provide a blueprint for future carbon-based nanocomposites for high-performance lithium-sulfur cells.

However, flooded electrolyte limits the practical energy density of Li-S pouch cells. In this study, a novel Fe0.34Co0.33Ni0.33S2 (FCN) is proposed as host for sulfur to realize Ah-level Li-S full cells demonstrating excellent electrochemical performances under 2 mu L mg(-1) lean electrolyte conditions. Moreover, Kelvin probe force microscopy shows that the FCN surface contains positive charge with a potential of approximate to 70 mV, improving the binding of polysulfides through Lewis acid base interaction. In particular, the FCN@S possesses inherent electrochemical activity of simultaneous anionic and cationic redox for lithium storage in the voltage window of 1.8-2.1 V, which additionally contributes to the specific capacity. Due to the low carbon content (approximate to 10 wt%), the sulfur loading is as high as approximate to 6 mg cm(-2), approaching an outstanding energy density of 394.9 and 267.2 Wh kg(-1) at the current density of 1.5 and 4 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, after 60 cycles at 1.5 mA cm(-2), the pouch cell still retains an energy of 300.2 Wh kg(-1). This study represents a milestone in the practical applications of high-energy Li-S batteries.

During carbonization, nano-CaCO3 acts as a template for creating a hierarchical porous carbon, and the N atoms originated from MF resin are in situ doped into the carbon matrix simultaneously. Meanwhile, volatile gases generated by the thermal decomposition of MF resin could serve as carbon and nitrogen sources to grow nitrogen-doped CNTs on HPC. The growth mechanism is the same as that for conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of CNTs on the metal catalysts, but the technological requirements are obviously not as harsh as those for the CVD method. Low-cost raw materials and simple equipment are sufficient for the growth. Moreover, the density and length of the CNTs are tunable, which can be simply adjusted via applying different amounts of Fe-Co catalysts. Such an N-doped hybrid structured carbon with mesopores can-not only effectively prompt the physical and chemical adsorption of polysulfides but also ensures a fast electron transfer because of the incorporation of CNTs, which provides sufficient conducting pathways and effective connections between the CNTs and HPC. Furthermore, CNTs grown on HPC can act as physical barriers to block the large pores on HPC, thereby reducing the polysulfide loss. Benefiting from the advantages, the NJTPC-CNT hybrids are a desirable host prospect for Li-S batteries.

New Separators in Lithium/Sulfur Cells with High-Capacity Cathodes	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Li-SM3 Conference	APR 26-27, 2017	London, ENGLAND				LI-S; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; SULFUR BATTERIES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; ENERGY DENSITY; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE CATHODES; CARBON; ELECTRODE; CHEMISTRY	Lithium-sulfur cells exhibit poor cycle life, due to the 'polysulfide shuttle' enabled by the dissolution of sulfur reduction products in organic electrolyte. Different strategies have been implemented to reduce the shuttle effects, including novel cathode designs to sequester polysulfides within the cathode, new electrolytes with reduced polysulfide solubility, and blocking layers to hinder polysulfide migration towards the anode. However, these are less successful in the case of high-energy Li/S cells with cathodes featuring substantial sulfur loadings, as proportionately greater polysulfide dissolution rapidly degrades performance. Additionally, the electrolyte/sulfur ratio is a limiting factor in high-energy cells, indicating that a minimum polysulfide solubility is required. Herein we describe the benefits of modified separators with the objective of blocking polysulfide migration. Specifically, we demonstrate improved discharge performance in laboratory Li/S cells with ceramic-coated separators, including single-sided and double-sided Al2O3-coated polyolefin material from commercial sources. We also developed a new AlF3 coating on a polyolefin separator that showed even greater improvements: higher initial specific capacity (similar to 800 mAh/gS), coulombic efficiency (>96%), and cycle life (>100 cycles). Detailed analytical study via SEM and EDS of separators harvested from cycled cells indicated an approximately uniform sulfur distribution across the ceramic-coated separator. Finally, concentrated electrolytes, which reportedly minimize polysulfide diffusion and lithium dendrite growth, were tested and shown to yield high coulombic efficiency although with low sulfur utilization.

Metal-organic framework@SiO2 as permselective separator for lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							COMPOSITE POLYMER ELECTROLYTES; SELF-DISCHARGE; OXIDE MEMBRANE; POROUS CARBON; POLYSULFIDE; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISM; STABILITY; CATALYST; CATHODE	The shuttling of polysulfides between the electrodes in a lithium-sulfur battery (Li-S) system remains a challenge to be addressed in order to realize the full potential of this promising technology. In order to overcome this issue several strategies have been adopted. In the present work, UiO-66-NH2@SiO2 was successfully synthesized and coated on a commercial Celgard 2320 membrane. The coating of UiO-66NH(2)@SiO2 on a Celgard 2320 membrane has not only enhanced the thermal stability and wettability but also other electrochemical properties such as ionic conductivity, compatibility and charge-discharge behavior. The Li-S cell with the UiO-66-NH2@SiO2-coated membrane delivered higher discharge capacity than the Li-S cell with SiO2-coated and uncoated membranes. The enhanced discharge capacity was attributed to the electrostatic and/or H-bonding interactions between the polysulfide and UiO-66-NH2@SiO2 as evidenced by its positive zeta potential (+56.42 mV). More importantly, the permselective properties of the membrane significantly play against the self-discharge of Li-S cells in which 98.5% of its capacity was retained even after 40 h which is superior to earlier reports.

However, direct comparison of these materials in their efficiency of suppressing LiPSs shuttling is challenging, owing to the structural and morphological differences between individual materials. This study introduces a simple route to synthesize a series of sulfur host materials with the same yolk-shell nanospindle morphology but tunable compositions (Fe3O4, FeS, or FeS2), which allows for a systematic investigation into the specific effect of chemical composition on the electrochemical performances of Li-S batteries. Among them, the S/FeS2-C electrode exhibits the best performance and delivers an initial capacity of 877.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C with a retention ratio of 86.7 % after 350 cycles. This approach can also be extended to the optimization of materials for other functionalities and applications.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur and Li2S, the "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and the volumetric change of sulfur electrodes limit the practical application of Li-S batteries. Here, lychee-like TiO2@TiN hollow spheres (LTTHS) have been developed that combine the advantages of high adsorption TiO2 and high conductivity TiN to achieve smooth adsorption/spread/conversion of LiPSs and use them as a sulfur host material in Li-S batteries for the first time. The cathode exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1254 mA h g(-1) and a reversible capacity of 533 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.2C, which corresponds to an average coulombic efficiency up to 99%. The cell with the LTTHS@S cathode achieved an extended lifespan of over 1000 cycles. Such good performance can be assigned to the good adsorption and catalysis of the dual-function TiO2@TiN composite. This work proved that the TiO2@TiN composite can be an attractive matrix for sulfur cathodes.

Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are one of the most recognized candidates to sub-stitute for the state-of-the-art lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. To conquer the dogged polysulfide shuttling in Li-S cells, a supramolecular crystal was synthesized via the coordination of a thiol ligand with nickel to generate a unique cage-like cluster in the form of N-4-Ni center dot center dot center dot Ni-S-4 as the precursor of organosulfur, in which sulfur was anchored on nitrogen sites. The organosulfur undergoes changes in both the configuration and electron distribution upon lithiation/delithiation process, which can strengthen entrapment of polysulfides, boost efficient sulfur conversion and promote the reaction kinetics of the cathodes. The Li-S cells were demonstrated a high initial discharge capacity of 1354.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a long-term lifespan of 1000 cycles at 2 C. The high-loading sulfur cathodes of 8.6 mg cm(-2) is capable of delivering an areal capacity as high as 9.1 mAh cm(-2). Combining with the advantages of low cost and facile synthesis, such organosulfur is of great promising perspective in further boosting the commercial realization of Li-S batteries.

Here, via a facile one-pot synthesis using carbothermic reduction, we prepared a porous and flexible carbon textile uniformly decorated with VC/V2O3-x hybrid nanoparticles, which was used as a robust and flexible host material for both sulfur cathode and Li metal anode. We observed that the defective V2O3-x part traps polysulfides and the conductive VC part catalytically enhances the fragmentation of the polysulfides. Moreover, it was found that the well-distributed VC/V2O3-x nanoparticles act as lithiophilic sites to lead uniform lithium nucleation for a dendrite-free lithium metal anode. The full battery delivered superb rate performance (882 mAh g (-1) at 5 degrees C) and an ultralow decay rate of 0.02% per cycle during 1000 cycles at 1 C. Even with a large sulfur loading of 7.0 mg cm(-2), a high areal capacity of 6.29 mAh cm(-2) at 0.2 C was obtained. This work provides an effective remedy to simultaneously resolve problems regarding the shuttle effect and the Li dendrite formation for the realization of high-performance flexible Li-S full batteries.

While, as a new generation of secondary batteries with great potential, the commercial applications of Li-S batteries are limited by rapid capacity decay due to the shuttle effect of LiPSs and large volume change of sulfur. Herein, nano-Fe3C@N,P dual-doped porous carbon microspheres (Fe3C@NPC) were designed as cathode hosts of Li-S batteries. Fe3C@NPC composite materials were prepared by upcycling mental from electroplating sludge via microalgae. The adsorption transformation of microalgae enables Fe3C nanocrystals of 10-30 nm to be evenly embedded in the N and P dual-doped carbon materials, which makes the crystal planes (220) of Fe3C nanocrystals more involved in the reaction, thus improving the coulomb efficiency and long cycle stability of Li-S battery. Besides, the hierarchically porous spherical structure with high specific surface area not only effectively adapts to the change of sulfur volume during the charging/discharging process, but also significantly increases the electrolyte contact area and shortens the Li ion transport distance. Therefore, Fe3C@NPC, as the multifunctional hosts of sulfur for Li-S batteries, realizes high catalytic activity and strong chemical binding with LiPSs, providing a high reversible coulomb efficiency (> 99%) and a high reversible capacity of 575 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles, with low-capacity decay rates of 0.056% per cycle.

Taking advantage of the electronic structure specific to tantalum, we explore the application of amorphous tantalum oxide with oxygen vacancies embedded inside a microporous carbon matrix as an electrocatalyst for the Li-S system. Through a pore-constrictionmechanism, the dimensions of tantalum oxide are controlled to be nanosized with abundant polysulfide-retaining and catalytically active sites. High cycle and rate performances were achieved at practically relevant sulfur loadings and electrolyte content.

Upon milling with carbon fibers, the solid electrolyte used within the cathode composite becomes electrochemically active. Analysis with Raman spectroscopy and XPS revealed the importance of bridging S-S bond formation and breaking in lithium polysulfidophosphates during electrochemical lithiation of the active solid electrolyte. Remarkably, when sulfur is introduced as an active material in the cathode composite, lithium polysulfides are formed as an intermediate product before full lithiation into lithium sulfide. The synthesis of materials based on bridging S-S bonds is an important avenue to the design of new cathodes for all-solid batteries.

The PIL molecular structure, polymer backbone, and polymer architecture were found to influence the cell capacity, the cyclability, and the morphology of the cathode itself. PILs with styrene backbones performed better than the vinyl-based polymer, while cross-linked PILs imparted further improved capacities, cyclability, and reduced overpotentials. Unlike polyvinylidene fluoride, PIL binders mixed with the sulfide species, resulting in more uniformly distributed sulfides in the cathode and better sulfide transport. These features helped to mitigate volume change-induced degradation that typically plagues Li-S batteries. The uptake of polysulfides by PILs also constrains the polysulfide shuttle during battery cycling, leading to better cycling stability. While traditionally binders are viewed only as a glue to hold the active material together, PIL binders have additional functions and play an active role during Li-S battery working operation.

However, the fast capacity fading induced by the polysulfide dissolution and subsequent shuttle effect hinders the application of Li-S batteries. Herein, a "pitaya"-like Co/C composite is prepared by a simple, rapid, and practical method and applied to Li-S battery coating. A Co-800@KJ-modified functional separator is constructed to improve the long-term cycle stability and rate capability of the pure sulfur cathode. Recessed depositions of Co particles and porous carbon effectively adsorb polysulfide by chemical anchoring and physical immobilization, respectively. Therefore, a stable long-term cycle ability of 620.5 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.3 C is realized. Meanwhile, Co embedded in the pores has abundant polysulfide adsorption and catalytic sites, so that the battery also has a capacity of 467.1 mAh g(-1) at 4.0 C.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is limited by the challenges of poor electrical conductivity of sulfur, dissolution of the polysulfide intermediates into the electrolyte, and volume expansion of sulfur during cycling. Herein, we report the fabrication of novel-structured porous carbon microspheres with a controllable multi-modal pore size distribution, i.e., a combination of interconnected micropores, mesopores and macropores. Cathodes made of sulfur infiltrated in such a hierarchical carbon framework provide several advantages: (1) a continuous and high surface area carbon network for enhanced electrical conductivity and high sulfur loading; (2) macropores and large mesopores bridged by small mesopores to provide good electrolyte accessibility and fast Li ion transport and to accommodate volume expansion of sulfur; and (3) small mesopores and micropores to improve carbon/sulfur interaction and to help trap polysulfides. An initial discharge capacity at 1278 mA h g(-1) and capacity retention at 70.7% (904 mA h g(-1)) after 100 cycles at a high rate (1 C) were achieved. The material fabrication process is relatively simple and easily scalable.

One promising resolution is to substitute liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes. However, the low intrinsic electrical conductivity of solid electrolytes results in the slow migration of lithium ions and electrons in the composite cathodes and compromises the rate and cycling performance of the all-solid-state Li-S cells. Here, sulfur nanoparticles are fused with carbon species of different dimensions (e.g., 0D carbon nanoparticles, 1D multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and ultra-long vapor grown carbon fibers (VGCF)) to form nanohybrids by the solvent exchange method, and are then assembled into electrically conducting networks in the composite cathode. The 0D and 1D nanohybrids facilitate the short and long-range migration of electrons, respectively. Fused with sulfur nanoparticles, the conducting networks themselves could act as sulfur-bearing matrixes and shorten the diffusion path of lithium ions. These favorable features give rise to much-enhanced electric/ionic conductivity and high sulfur loading of the composite cathode. The all-solid-state Li-S batteries (ASSLSBs) assembled with these composite cathodes have so far exhibited the highest high-rate cycling capacity and retention at room temperature. A discharge capacity of 1140.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.176 mA cm(-2) (about 0.1C) was achieved with a capacity retention of 100% after 400 cycles. After 1000 cycles, the battery still showed a high discharge capacity of 834.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.44 mA cm(-2) (about 0.25C).

Here, a scalable method inspired by the commercialized production of Na2S is used to prepare a hierarchical porous carbon-sulfur hybrid (denoted HPC-S) with high sulfur content (approximate to 85 wt%). The HPC-S is characterized by the structure of sulfur nanodots naturally embedded in a 3D carbon network. The strategy uses Na2SO4 as the starting material, which serves not only as the sulfur precursor but also as a salt template for the formation of the 3D carbon network. The HPC-S cathode with such a high sulfur content shows excellent rate performance and cycling stability in Li-S batteries because of the sulfur nanoparticles, the unique carbon framework, and the strong interaction between them. The production method can also be readily scaled up and used in practical Li-S battery applications.

After introduction of the B2O3/carbon microtube composite interlayer, the iodine cathode demonstrates a reversible capacity of 176.9 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at a rate of 20C. When the rate increases to 100C, a high capacity of 140.7 mA h g(-1) can still be obtained after 5000 cycles, which makes this the most stable iodine cathode reported for Li-I-2 batteries to date. For Li-S batteries, the sulfur cathodes present excellent cycling performance with a high discharge capacity of 594 mA h g(-1) at the rate of 4C. Such excellent cycle stability for the Li-S and Li-I-2 batteries could be mainly attributed to strong interactions between the ultra-small B2O3 nanocrystals and polysulfide or iodine ions, which has been proven using first principle calculations.

The catalysts in the Li-S batteries are often useless in the solid-solid conversion due to the poor contact interfaces between solid catalysts and insoluble solid Li2S2. Considering that ultrafine nanostructured materials have the properties of quantum size effects and unconventional reactivities, we design and synthesize for the pomegranate-like sulfur nanoclusters@nitrogen-doped carbon@nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres (S@N-C@N-C NSs) with a seed-pulp-peel nanostructure. The ultrafine S@N-C subunits (diameter approximate to 5 nm) and effects of a spatial structure perfectly realize the rapid conversion of ultrafine Li2S2 to Li2S. The S@N-C@N-C seed-pulp-peel NS cathodes exhibit excellent sulfur utilization, superb rate performance (760 mAh g(-1) at 10.0 C), and an ultralow capacity decay rate of about 0.016% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 4.0 C. The proposed strategy based on ultrafine nanostructured materials can also inform material engineering in related energy storage and conversion fields.

However, poorly cycling stability and rapidly decay caused by shuttle effects at high-sulfur loading condition restrain their practical applications. Focusing on these issues, N-doped hollow porous carbon nanotubes (N-HPCNT) as a self-supporting sulfur cathode is developed. The inherent conductivity and abundant pores of 3D continuous framework not only allow a high-sulfur content (67 wt%) and block the polysulfides via physical confinement, but also trap the polysulfides by the nitrogen heteroatoms (4.60 wt%) via strong chemisorption. Benefiting from the above-mentioned merits, the self-supporting S/N-HPCNT cathode with 3 mg cm(-2) sulfur delivers high reversible capacity, super rate capability (1152 and 852.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 and 3 C, respectively) and long cycling stability (717.9 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1 C). Even under a higher sulfur loading (8 mg cm(-2)), it still exhibits a stable areal capacity of 7.72 mAh cm(-2) (corresponding to 965.1 mAh g(-1)) after 60 cycles. This work provides a pathway for developing high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For the first time, nanoparticles serve the dual role of an emulsion stabilizer and a pore template for the shell, directly utilizing in situ generated CO2 bubbles as template for the core. The minimalistic nature of this method does not require expensive surfactants or additional core templates. Upon polymerization of melamine formaldehyde onto CO2, a robust polymer/silica composite shell is formed and transformed into a porous shell upon washing. The micrometer-sized hollow morphology in combination with its nitrogen rich porous shell demonstrates impressive rate capabilities of 670 and 500 mAh g(-1) even at a high rate of 7C and 9C, respectively. This material also possesses excellent cycle durability, exhibiting a low capacity decay of 0.088%/ cycle over 300 cycles. Measurement of the shuttle current and impedance provides interesting insight into the polysulfide mass transfer mechanism of hollow structured sulfur hosts.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur and the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides result in serious technical issues, such as low utilization rate of sulfur, reduced columbic efficiency, and poor cycling stability, which compromise the high theoretical performance of Li-S batteries. In the past years, various attempts have been made to achieve high specific capacity and reliable cycling stability of Li-S batteries. Incorporation of sulfur into functional host materials has been demonstrated to be effective to improve the electrochemical performance of sulfur-based cathodes via enhancing the electron and Li ion conductivities, immobilizing sulfur/lithium polysulfides in cathodes, and accommodating the volume changes in sulfur-based cathodes. Therefore, the rational design of sulfur-containing composites needs to be emphasized as key strategies to develop high-performance cathodes for Li-S batteries. In this perspective, after reviewing the achievements obtained in the design of sulfur-containing composites as cathodes for Li-S batteries, we propose the new issues that should be overcome to facilitate the practical application of Li-S batteries.

We modified the classical polycondensation of resorcinol-formaldehyde, by adding a large excess of melamine in basic medium. A series of materials were prepared by varying the maximum carbonization temperature in the range 600-900 degrees C, and are denoted NCC-X, where X denotes that maximum temperature. NCC-X showed a high nitrogen content, ranging from 32.9% to 10.3%. Scanning electron microscopy showed macropores in the order of 100-600 nm, with sizes decreasing with temperature, reaching a minimum for NCC-800, and then increasing again. N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms showed the presence of micro and mesopores for all samples, with a maximum surface area of 505 m(2) g(-1) for NCC-800. CO2 adsorption isotherms showed that all NCC-X materials present ultrami-cropores. NCC-X were incorporated as host materials for elemental sulfur in lithium-sulfur batteries. The increased narrow micropore volume of materials pyrolysed at higher temperature seems to promote an initial higher cell capacity. Conversely, the much higher N content and the higher amount of N in pyridinic environments were identified as the reasons for the higher cycling stability of the cells prepared with NCC-600-7h and NCC-750.

Herein, well-dispersed Ni2P electrocatalysts decorated hollow carbon spheres (Ni2P-HCS) are constructed as high-efficiency bi-functional mediator for Li-S batteries. Benefiting from polar surface and high electrical conductivity, Ni2P-HCS possesses strong interaction and efficient electrocatalysis toward polysulfides. Moreover, regulated Li deposition behavior is realized on lithiated Ni2P-HCS surface ascribed to its lithiophilicity and as-formed mixed ion-electron conducting host composed of Li3P and Ni. As a result, the assembled Li-S full cells with Ni2P-HCS used as interlayer and Li host exhibit excellent rate capability (755.5 mAh g(-1) at 2 C) and long-term cycling stability (capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle at 1 C after 500 cycles). Importantly, high areal capacity (6.67 mAh cm(-2)) with high sulfur loading of 5.9 mg cm(-2) at low E/S ratio (6.8 mu L mg(-1)) is achieved.

The nanofibers were prepared by blending and electrospinning two immiscible polymers, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and cellulose diacetate (CDA) with dimethylformamide as the solvent. Humidity control during the electrospinning process made adjustments to the size of the meso-scaled phase separation domains of the sacrificial CDA. The resultant fiber mat was carbonized and activated in air to create micropores in mesoporous carbon nanofibers (MPCNF). The pore characteristics of the activated MPCNFs were examined and then tested as interlayers in Li-sulfur batteries. First, a fundamental study was conducted regarding the effectiveness of the interlayer versus its own weight and the overall sulfur composition along with a characterization of the pore filling and impedance. Secondly, the effect of micropores and three different pore widths of large mesopores in interlayers on battery performance was studied which revealed that the largest mesopores played a critical role in improving rate capability. Cells with MPCNF interlayers with 50+ nm pores and 70:30 sulfur: Super P composite cathodes had a discharge capacity of over similar to 1100 mAh g(-1) sulfur for 100 cycles at 0.5C and exhibited improved high charge rate capabilities with 850mAh g(-1) at 3C.

However, the growth of dendritic and mossy lithium for rechargeable Li metal batteries lead to the possible short circuiting and subsequently serious safety issues during charge/discharge cycles. For the further practical applications of Li anode, here we report a facile method for fabricating robust interfacial layer via in-situ olefin polymerization. The resulting polymer layer effectively suppresses the formation of Li dendrites and enables the long-term operation of Li metal batteries. Using Li-S cells as a test system, we also demonstrate an improved capacity retention with the protection of tetramethylethylene-polymer. Our results indicate that this method could be a promising strategy to tackle the intrinsic problems of lithium metal anodes and promote the development of Li metal batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The carbyne analogue was obtained by dehydrochlorination of polyvinylidene chloride. By means of several characterization methods, it was proved that the carbyne polysulfide has a unique and stable structure of a conducting sp(2) hybrid carbon skeleton connected to energy-storing sulfur side chains. And in terms of morphology, it has a well-developed porous structure with an uneven pore size. The elements C and S in the organic sulfide are approximately 43.4 wt% and 54.1 wt% respectively. As a cathode material for lithium/sulfur batteries, the carbyne polysulfide displays a high reversible capacity of 960 mA h g(sulfur)(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.1 C (168 mA g(sulfur)(-1)) current rate in carbonic ester electrolyte. It also exhibits a reversible capacity as high as 705 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) when cycled at 1 C (1680 mA g(sulfur)(-1)) current rate. This organic sulfide exhibits great potential as a promising cathode material for high performance rechargeable lithium/sulfur batteries.

Enriched energy storage capability and bi-functional ability of boron-doped graphene as efficient electrode for supercapacitors and lithium sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							ACTIVATED CARBON; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; DENSITY	This work depicts the preparation of boron-doped graphene (BG) and its application as bi-functional electrode material for both the supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. Structural, morphological, and elemental analyses of the prepared material were acquired via X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. BG worked well in supercapacitors as a capacitive electrode, featuring a high specific capacitance of 239 F g(-1) at a current rate of 1 A g(-1) and high capacity retention of 85% over 10,000 charge/discharge cycles with average coulombic efficiency of 99.5%. In addition, the sulfur/boron-doped graphene (SBG) binary composite was prepared via melt diffusion method and used as the positive electrode material in Li-S batteries. BG is effective polysulfide adsorbent and its sheet-like structure accommodates more content of sulfur, which restricts the shuttle effect and volume changes of active material during cycling. The SBG composite shows an initial discharge capacity of 1355 mAh g(-1), and it retains the discharge capacity of 636 mAh g(-1) over the 50 cycles. The present work demonstrates that BG is an efficient electrode material for energy storage applications.

Results show that the sulfur-carbon cathode gains mass during the first discharge plateau (similar to 2.4 V) due to the formation of the long chain polysulfides during the discharge (lithiation) process. However, further discharge to below 2.4 V yields an increase in the crystal resistance (R-c) suggesting the sulfur-carbon cathode becomes rougher. During the charge (delithiation) process, the roughness of the sulfur-carbon cathode decreases. Time dependent measurements show that the electrode surface becomes rougher with the deeper discharge, with the change occurring following a step to 1.5 V. The sulfur-carbon cathode exhibits stable R-c and frequency behavior initially, but then becomes rougher in subsequent following cycles.

In this study, we integrated the excellent conductivity of graphene and chemical adsorption of ZnO to confine polysulfides by applying a film of ZnO/graphene on a membrane to functionalize separators. To determine the effect of microstructures of polar materials on the electrochemistry of a sulfur cathode in terms of dimensions and hollow structures, different ZnO structures were designed, which could guide the effective functionalization of separators. Systematic electrochemical testing results indicated that 1D ZnO nanotubes and 3D ZnO hollow octahedra were composed of smaller nanoparticles, which could provide sufficient active sites to adsorb polysulfides by chemisorption. The voids in channels and hollow structures could locally condense the polysulfides, thus promoting reaction kinetics. Besides, the 1D channels could orientationally accelerate the electron transport and shorten the ion transport distance to further improve reaction kinetics. These advantages were not shown by 0D ZnO nanoparticles. Hence, 1D ZnO/2D graphene (1D/2D)-functionalized membranes played the role of restricting the shuttle effect of polysulfides better than 3D ZnO/2D graphene (3D/2D) separators, and the 0D/2D separator exhibited the worst restriction over polysulfides. The cells with 1D/2D separators exhibited excellent cycling performance (927 mA h g(-1) at 1C after 200 cycles) and high rate capacity (754 mA h g(-1) at 6.0C).

Herein we proposed a failure mechanism of Li metal anode in Li-S cells based on the mechanistic investigation into the complex interactions between LiPSs and Li metal. The LiPSs participate the formation of inorganic layers in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in a LiPS-LiNO3 containing ether-based electrolyte. Li metal anode is well protected by the stable inorganic layer in-situ formed in an electrolyte containing 0.020 M Li2S5 (0.10 M sulfur) and 5.0 wt % LiNO3. The metal anode with LiF-Li2Sx riched SEI rendered a stable Coulombic efficiency of 95% after 233 cycles for Li-Cu half cells. A dendrite-free morphology of Li metal anode is observed under the harsh condition. When the LiPS is with a very high concentration of higher than 0.50 M sulfur in the organic electrolyte, the in-situ formed SEI cannot well maintain and the Li metal is gradually etched. Therefore, the polysulfide dissolution and diffusion should be delicately regulated to render a practical Li-S cell when the areal sulfur loading is high. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This work systematically explores the use of a waste stream to generate electrode components and the influence that treatment and preparation factors have on electrochemical performance. A series of carbonaceous materials derived from waste rubber tires are prepared, involving pyrolysis at 700 and 900 degrees C as well as physical activation using a feed of CO2 gas. Results from Raman spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) show an increase in graphitic character and larger particle size distribution of the carbon with increasing temperatures of pyrolyzation. They also reveal the impact of air and moisture on the evolution of crystalline impurities such as ZnS, CaCO3, and Ca(OH)(2), and consequently their impact on the evolution of the carbon morphology. Galvanostatic cycling of Na-ion and Li-S cells involving the pyrolyzed rubber tires as an electrode component reveal different priorities as to which parameters to improve when designing materials for different cell systems. While higher specific capacities are achieved with more graphitic carbon morphologies in Na half-cells (300 mAh g(-1) discharge capacity maintained after 20 cycles at 10 mA g(-1)), less graphitic morphologies were observed to reduce capacity fading experienced in Li-S cells (1003 mAh g(-1) discharge capacity maintained after 18 cycles at 167.2 mA g(-1), similar to 76% of initial value). Ex situ Raman, XRD, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopies were used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in post electrochemical treatment. This work highlights a pathway to use waste tires to generate valuable electrode components (active material in Na half-cells and S hosts in Li-S cells), and a similar methodology could be applied to other waste streams.

Herein, novel 3D interconnected porous carbon nanosheets/carbon nanotubes (denoted as PC/CNT) as a poly-sulfide reservoir are synthesized by a simple one-pot pyrolysis method. In the designed hybrid carbon matrix, porous carbon nanosheets exhibit hierarchical porous structures for high sulfur loading and effectively strengthen the physical confinement to trap soluble polysulfides, while carbon nanotubes provide a highly robust conductive pathway which can facilitate electron transport and maintain structural integrity. Moreover, the 3D interconnected structure combining 1D carbon nanotubes and 2D porous carbon nanosheets is beneficial for rapid electrical/ionic transport and favorable electrolyte infiltration. As a result, the S-PC/CNT composite exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance, with a high active-sulfur utilization, high specific capacity (1485.4, 1300.3 and 1138 mA h g(-1) at 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively), superior cycling stability (only 0.1% capacity decay per cycle over 400 cycles at 2 C) and excellent rate capability (the reversible capacity of 749 mA h g(-1) even at 4 C).

In order to suppress the "shuttle effect," a new strategy of using a highly lithium ion conductive lithium fluoride/graphene oxide (LiF/GO) solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to mechanically prevent the lithium dendrite breakthrough is reported. When utilized in Li-S batteries, the LiF/GO SEI coated separator demonstrates significant feature in mitigating the polysulfide shuttling as observed by in situ UV-vis spectroscopy. Moreover, the restrained " shuttle effect" can also be confirmed by analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and characterization of lithium dendrites, which indicates that no insulating layer of solid Li2S2/Li2S is found on lithium anode surface. Furthermore, the LiF/GO SEI layer puts out good lithium ion conductivity as its lithium ion diffusion coefficient reaches a high value of 1.5 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1). These features enable a remarkable cyclic property of 0.043% of capacity decay per cycle during 400 cycles.

Adding a carbon interlayer to prevent the polysulfides from migrating is feasible, and a rational design of the structures and surface properties of the carbon layer is essential to increasing its effectiveness. Herein, we report a hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) created by carbonization of bis(phenoxy)phosphazene and in-situ doping of triple heteroatoms into the carbon lattice to fabricate an effective polysulfide-trapping interlayer. The generated carbon integrates the advantages of a hierarchical porous structure, a high specific area and rich dopants (N, O and P), to yield chemisorption and physical confinement for polysulfides and fast ion-transport synergistically. The HPC interlayer significantly improves the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries, including an exceptional discharge capacity of 1509 mA h/g at 0.06 C and a high capacity retention of 83.7 % after 250 cycles at 0.3 C. This work thus proposes a facile in-situ synthesis of heteroatom-doped carbon with rational porous structures for suppressing the shuttle effect.

However, polysulfides shuttle and low S loading severely impede their practical applications. Here, we report design of advanced separators for Li-S batteries using natural minerals with 1D to 3D microstructures. Four natural minerals with different microstructures including 1D halloysite nanotubes, 1D attapulgite nanorods, 2D Li+-montmorillonite (Mmt) nanosheets and 3D porous diatomite were used together with carbon black (CB) for preparation of the mineral/CB-Celgard separators. The Si-OH groups of the minerals act as Lewis acid sites, which could effectively absorb polysulfides by forming Li-O and O-S bonds with polysulfides. Among all the separators, the Mmt/CB-Celgard separator endowed the Li-S battery with the highest upper plateau discharge capacity (369 mA h g-1), initial reversible capacity (1496 mA h g-1 at 0.1 C), rate performance and cycling stability (666 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 1.0 C with 0.046% capacity decay per cycle). The Mmt/CB-Celgard separator also enabled stable cycling of the Li-S battery with high S loading (8.3 mg cm-2) cathode. This work will provide inspiration for future development of advanced separators for high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

A model of the sulfur infiltration is presented in this study, taking into account the pore size distribution of the porous cathode host, phase transitions in sulfur, and formation of different sulfur allotropes, depending on pore size, formation energy and available thermal energy. Simulations of sulfur infiltration into an activated carbon fabric at a hot-plate temperature of 175 degrees C for two hours predicted a composite cathode with 41 wt% sulfur (8.3 mg cm(-2)), in excellent agreement with the experiment. The pore size distribution of the porous carbon host proved critical for both the extent and form of retained sulfur, where pores below 0.4 nm could not accommodate any sulfur, pores between 0.4 and 0.7 nm retained S-4 and S-6 allotropes, and pores between 0.7 and 1.5 nm contained S-8.

However, the polysulfide dissolution and low electronic conductivity of Li2S limit its further application in next-generation Li-S batteries. In this report, a nanoporous Li2S@C-Co-N cathode is synthesized by liquid infiltration-evaporation of ultrafine Li2S nano particles into graphitic carbon co-doped with cobalt and nitrogen (C-Co-N) derived from metal-organic frameworks. The obtained Li2S@C-Co-N architecture remarkably immobilizes Li2S within the cathode structure through physical and chemical molecular interactions. Owing to the synergistic interactions between C-Co-N and Li2S nanoparticles, the Li2S@C-Co-N composite delivers a reversible capacity of 1155.3 (99.1% of theoretical value) at the initial cycle and 929.6 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles, with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency and a capacity fading of 0.06% per cycle. It exhibits excellent rate capacities of 950.6, 898.8, and 604.1 mAh g(-1) at 1C, 2C, and 4C, respectively. Such a cathode structure is promising for practical applications in highperformance Li-S batteries.

Herein, a singlesource decomposition approach is employed to synthesize a pomegranate-like nitrogenous carbon-coated ZnS (ZnS@NC) precursor that is acid etched to obtain the partially etched ZnS@NC (PE-ZnS@NC) composite. PE-ZnS@NC is coated on a commercial PP separator to a fabricate PE-ZnS@NC/PP functional separator that is used to assemble a coin cell with the sulfur/super P cathode. The 3D network carbon framework of PE-ZnS@ NC provides additional active sites for electrochemical reaction and a space barrier for the diffusion of the dissolved lithium polysulfides (LPS). Well-distributed N-containing functional groups and polar ZnS could chemically anchor LPS. Also, the ZnS nanoparticles inside could facilitate a fast kinetic process by catalyzing the liquid-liquid and liquid-solid conversion. Since the shuttle effect is greatly suppressed by the synergistic trifunctions of blockage-chemisorption catalysis, PE-ZnS@NC/PP delivers remarkable electrochemical performances that a self-discharge rate of 0.4% per day is achieved in the shelving test and a capacity retention of 97.0% is gained after 50 cycles at 0.5 C, under a sulfur-areal density of around 3 mg cm(-2).

This study aims to solve the shuttle effect by anchoring polysulfide onto porous carbon/sulfur cathodes via chemical interactions. The porous activated carbons were derived from glutinous rice (RAC) and were modified through water (RAC-W) or ammonia radiolysis (RAC-N) using a gamma source (25 kGy). The specific capacities of LSBs obtained from RAC-W and RAC-N are >900 mA h g(-1) and they are stable for more than 150 cycles, which is significantly higher than that of unmodified RAC. Furthermore, carbonyl and pyridinic nitrogen moieties formed in RAC-W and RAC-N from gamma radiolysis result in enhanced interactions between polysulfide and the cathode framework.

Nevertheless, a sluggish electrochemical kinetics of the battery limited by a slow conversion of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) intermediates and LiPSs shuttle effect severely hinder its development towards industrial application. Herein, we designed the oxidized Nb2C MXene with amorphous carbon (Nb2O5/C) composites as sulfur host using CO2 treatment to address the above issues. The Nb2O5/C composites with high conductivity are directly employed as sulfur hosts for Li-S battery capable to remarkably mitigate the shuttle phenomenon due to a combined effect of their LiPSs trapping ability and catalytic activity towards their accelerated conversion. Meanwhile, the unique layered structure of the composite facilitates ion transfer and accommodates the volume changes of the cathode during cycling. With this rational design, the resultant Li-S batteries exhibit superior electrochemical performance with a high initial specific capacity of 745 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 C and a reversible capacity of 620 mAh g(-1) at a high rate cycling at 3.0 C.

Here, we report a novel electrode design to achieve high energy density and long-cycling Li-S batteries, which rely on a cost-effective and well-performed carbon nanofiber-porous carbon paper (CNFPC) electrode. In this design, the CNF substrate with a high electrical conductivity (420 S cm(-1)) and an extremely low density (similar to 0.2 g cm(-3)) is used as a current collector and as a host for high sulfur-loading (similar to 6.7 mg cm(-2), while the carbon black nanoparticles which are welldistributed within the CNF substrate function as electrical bridges for nonconductive sulfur and highly conductive CNF framework. In addition, the densely packed (similar to 6.6 g cm(-3)) porous carbon layer (similar to 5 mu m) on the top of CNF acts as a protective layer to inhibit polysulfide shuttle between cathode and anode. As a result, this unique design enables the fabrication of Li-S batteries with a remarkably high reversible capacity exceeding 900 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, 800 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, and 700 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, while the average coulombic efficiency is greater than 99.5%. Moreover, at a high current rate of 1.5 C, capacity retention from 709 to 302 mAh g(-1), corresponding to an areal capacity of >2 mAh cm(-2), is obtained over 1000 cycles.

By calculating the transport barrier of Li+ ion through ORSs on the CNT walls and comparing the molecular size of solvents and Li-PSs with ORSs, optimum open-rings with 16-30 surrounding carbon atoms were predicted to selectively allow transportation of Li+ ion and evaporated sulfur while blocking both Li-PS and solvent molecules. A CNT oxidation process was proposed and simulated to generate these ORSs, and the results indicated that the optimum ORSs can be achieved by narrowly controlling the oxidation parameters. Subsequently, S@CNT cathodes were experimentally synthesized, confirming that optimum ORSs were generated in CNT oxidized at 475 K and exhibited more stable cycling behavior.

The as-obtained n-hC exhibits a large surface area (2071 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (1.11 cm(3) g(-1)) and a high N content (3.47%). The n-hC is used as an S-hosting material with a mass loading of 64.1 wt% (S@n-hC) through the in situ redox reaction of Na2S2O3. The S@n-hC achieves a high initial discharge capacity of 1295.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and retains 647.2 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles, and shows excellent cycling stability (with the capacity fading of 0.05% per cycle over 900 cycles at 1C). The strong confinement of S in the N-incorporated micropores leads to the electrochemical and thermal stabilization of S, providing different redox environments. The facile and reversible redox kinetics of the S@n-hC are confirmed by deriving the lowest exchange current density and redox charge-transfer resistance from Tafel and Nyquist plots and through the prominent redox and charge/discharge profiles. The improved performance of the S@n-hC is attributed to the S confinement in the micropores, the honeycomb-like hierarchical structure, and the N incorporation for the inhibition of polysulfide dissolution and the efficient utilization of S.

Through the combination of experimental and theoretical results, a bifunctional separator has been designed by coating hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP)-decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which provides effective anchor sites for immobilizing the LiPSs. LiPSs can be adsorbed on the HCCP/rGO surface with moderate binding strength, and their structures and the electrical conductivity of HCCP/rGO are well maintained. The synergetic effect of the effective barrier and good electrical conductivity within the HCCP/rGO sheets efficiently anchors LiPSs and achieves enhanced electrochemical performance. More importantly, different substituents can be used to tune the immobilization of LiPSs by HCCP derivatives. Therefore, it is expected that HCCP and its derivatives can be utilized as a promising anchoring material for high-performance Li-S batteries.

MIL-100(V) is expected to be a good host for sulfur impregnation and an excellent sulfur cathode host for Li-S batteries, not only because of its unique mesoporous structure, but also owing to the presence of vanadium ions with various valence states, which can offer different Lewis acid sites and allow for strong interactions with sulfur and lithium polysulfides. In this study, mesoporous MIL-100(V) and MIL-100(V)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites have been applied as novel hosts for Li-S batteries for the first time. When tested as cathodes for Li-S batteries, both S@MIL-100(V) and S@MIL-100(V)/rGO exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. The S@MIL-100(V) cathode has been demonstrated to have a reversible capacity of similar to 550 mAh/g at 0.1 C (1 C = 1,675 mAh/g) after 200 cycles with low capacity fading of 0.17% per cycle. Moreover, S@MIL-100(V)/rGO maintains a capacity of 650 mAh/g at 0.1 C after 75 cycles, whereas at 0.5 C, the capacity is maintained at 500 mAh/g after 200 cycles and 450 mAh/g after 300 cycles. The above results reveal that the use of MIL-100(V) and MIL-100(V)/rGO as hosts for Li-S batteries can effectively enhance the cycling stability and improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

However, sulfur-based cathodes suffer from dissolution of polysulfides causing shuttle effects. Here, in order to confine elemental sulfur and anchor the polysulfides, a novel host that is an inexpensive natural clay mineral, viz., vermiculite is proposed. When compared to regular carbon-sulfur composites, vermiculite-sulfur composites offer promising rate capability and much better cycling stabilities, displaying capacity retentions of approximate to 89 and approximate to 93% within 200 cycles at C/2 and 1 C, respectively, and approximate to 60 % at C/5 within 1000 cycles. Postmortem studies, advanced adsorption tests, density functional theory calculations, and zeta potential measurements in combination with intrinsic characteristics of the natural vermiculite provide insights into the new mechanism. The vermiculite contains naturally present surface cations which show a strong tendency to adsorb S-n(2-) anions, hence protecting them from dissolution. The excess surface charge is most probably compensated by excess Li+ in the space charge zones which is beneficial for charge transfer and local conductivity. The reported results show that natural clay-minerals are promising sulfur hosts being able to fixate sulfides via electrical double layer effects, thus enabling high-performance in lithium-chalcogen batteries.

The shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide species between the cathode and the anode can cause the loss of active materials and the attenuation of specific capacity in LSBs. Herein, the N-doped porous carbon (NC) nanosheets with uniformly anchored defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2/NC) were constructed by a simple and low-cost method. The NC nanosheets facilitate transfer of lithium ion and electron and localize polysulfides via the Li-N chemical bond. The defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets can be used as electrocatalysts to propel polysulfide conversion by abundant catalytic activity sites and thus control the shuttle effect as well as improve cycling performances of LSBs. Consequently, the defect-rich MoS2/NC composites as separator modification present a high specific capacity of 1021 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 degrees C after 100 cycles and superior long-term performances with enhanced specific capacities of 429 mAh g(-1) with a low capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle at 5 C after 1000 cycles. The reasonable construct strategy of defect-rich MoS2/NC composites is effective in enhancing the electrochemical performances of LSBs and promoting their commercial applications.

The incorporation of MXene can significantly improve the performance of LSBs; however, the underlying mechanism at the atomic scale has not been deeply explored. In the present work, by using density functional theory calculations, we systemically studied the interactions of lithium (poly)sulfides (Li2Sm) on Ti-based bare MXenes (TinXn-1) and surface functionalized Ti2C with -F, -O, and -OH groups. Through analyzing the geometric and electronic structures, binding energies, and deformation charge densities of Li,S. adsorbed MXenes, we found that the strong Ti-S bonds dominate the interactions between Li,S. and MXenes.

Liquid phase adsorption in combination with nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used to elucidate and quantify polysulfide retention in typical porous cathode materials used in lithium sulfur batteries without cell assembly to achieve a more fundamental understanding of liquid phase adsorption phenomena as a responsible mechanism for polysulfide retention. The individual impact of each pore size increment is quantified on the polysulfi de adsorption (PSA). Ultramicropores show eight times higher PSA (1.48 mmol cm(-3)) than mesopores. Strong heteroatom-doped ultramicropores show even stronger interactions with polysulfi des leading to 25 times higher adsorption compared to hydrophobic mesopores. These findings allow to precisely tailor pore structure and heteroatom distribution of cathode materials for next generation lithium sulfur batteries with prolonged cycle life and reduced capacity fading.

Herein, polyacrylonitrile-poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (PAN/PDAAQ) and PAN-potassium functionalized graphene (PAN/K-FGF) nanofibers are synthesized via electrospinning method and act as effective separators for Li-S batteries to minimize polysulfides diffusion toward the anode. PAN/K-FGF coated separator shows capacity retention of 768 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 1C. The capacity maintains at 419 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles. PAN/PDAAQ nanofibers are coated on glass fiber separator functions as physical and chemical barrier for polysulfides diffusion. Therefore, the cell with PAN/PDAAQ coating on the separator demonstrates capacity retention of 881 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 1C and small capacity decay rate of 0.11% per cycle resulted in 800 cycles at 1C.

Here, N,O dual-doped carbons were developed as sulfur host with adjustable porosity, graphited degree and surficial chemistry by simply changing molten inorganic salts (none, NaCl, NaCl/FeCl3) during sintering with aniline-pyrrole copolymer. NaCl promotes the graphitization and porosity with multi-scaled porous carbon host (CH2). NaCl/FeCl3 boosts doping content and facilitates transformation of both chemical state of doping elements and morphology to micro-meso pores dominated nanosheet (CH3) from little porous bulk (CHI). The flexible CH3 nanosheet with micro-mesopores could physically block dissolved Li2Sn (4 <= n <= 8) and provide large interfacial area to guarantee good electronic conductivity and ionic transport of the sulfur cathode for improving the electrochemical reactions kinetics. Furthermore, the high content doped pyrrolic N and epoxidized O in CH3 enhance chemical adsorption of soluble Li2Sn and accelerate the conversion process between Li2Sn and Li2S2/Li-2 S. Hence, CH3/S system exhibits similar to 30% and similar to 167% higher capacity than CH2/S and CH1/S after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Our results clarify the working mechanism of carbon morphology and nitrogen, oxygen co-doping state tuning and promote the development of high-electrochemical performance LSBs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a three-dimensional hybrid sulfur host composed of graphitic carbon nitride and functionalized carbon nanotubes is prepared via a self- assembly-assisted method assisted by calcination. The structural analysis results indicate that graphitic carbon nitride sheets are grown in situ on the surfaces of the carbon nanotubes and that the two components are connected by C-N bonds to form a larger pi-conjugated system. This unique structural linkage between the two parts directs electron transfer from the carbon nanotubes to the carbon nitride, resulting in enhanced conductivity of the integrated hybrid composite and processing a sufficient number of nitrogen-containing functional groups. Thus, as a sulfur host, the hybrid composite can efficiently restrain the shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides because of its high sulfur utilization and strong chemical interaction with polysulfides. As a result, a modified sulfur cathode with a high sulfur content of 80 wt % delivers a high specific capacity of 1351.2 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.1 C. Even at a 5 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading, the cathode exhibits an initial capacity of 758.9 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 77.1% after 200 cycles at 1 C.

However, current CNT production is still dominated by relatively high-cost chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods, which usually involve high temperatures, expensive catalysts, and substantial quantities of nonrenewable petroleum-derived carbon sources. Here, we report that highly dense carbon nanotubes can be derived from yeast-fermented wheat dough scaffolds via a simple, green, and sustainable activation process without using any additional catalysts or extra carbon sources. When the activated wheat dough/carbon nanotube (AWD/CNT) scaffold is used as a sulfur host to prepare cathode for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, the assembled Li-S cell exhibited excellent cyclic performance, with a well-retained capacity of similar to 450 mA h g(-1) even after 1500 cycles at a high charge/discharge rate of 1 C. A "self-catalysis" growth mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of the yeast-derived CNTs. Our new findings represent a paradigm shift in developing CNTs and provide a promising solution to obtain advanced renewable carbon materials from natural and abundant biomass materials for use in energy storage applications.

In this study, an ultra-light flexible carbon foam (MFC) with a 3D interconnected hollow network was prepared through a special heating program from melamine-formaldehyde foam. The MFC can be used as an efficient host material to achieve both ultra-high sulphur loading and good electrochemical performance in lithium-sulphur batteries. Without a conductive additive and a binder, the sulphur loading in the MFC-based cathode could easily reach up to 75%. The MFC contains a high content of N and O strongly absorbing the polysulfides and has a flexible and sparse skeleton accommodating large volume change during electrochemical reactions. To further improve the performance of the eletrode, GO or rGO was used to decorate the MFC skeleton. The MFC-based electrodes with 75% sulfur loading have excellent cycling performance. The initial capacity of the MFC-S, MFC-GO-S and MFC-rGO-S, based on the mass of the whole electrodes, are 1010.7 mA h g(-1), 1183.1 mA h g(-1) and 1134.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, respectively. After the inevitable capacity fading in the first few cycles, the capacity retention is over 95% after 100 cycles compared with the 20th cycle. These results indicate that the carbon foam is an excellent choice for high sulphur loading Li-S batteries.

Among the key features that affect the cyclability, the shuttling process involving polysulfides (PS) dissolution is most fatal. In an effort to suppress this chronic PS shuttling, herein, a separator coated with poled BaTiO3 or BTO particles is introduced. Permanent dipoles that are formed in the BTO particles upon the application of an electric field can effectively reject PS from passing through the separator via electrostatic repulsion, resulting in significantly improved cyclability, even when a simple mixture of elemental sulfur and conductive carbon is used as a sulfur cathode. The coating of BTO particles also considerably suppresses thermal shrinkage of the poly(ethylene) separator at high temperatures and thus enhances the safety of the cell adopting the given separator. The incorporation of poled particles can be universally applied to a wide range of rechargeable batteries (i.e., metal-air batteries) that suffer from cross-contamination of charged species between both electrodes.

J	Zhang, TQ; Wang, HX; Zhao, JX				Zhang, Tianqi; Wang, Hongxia; Zhao, Jingxiang			Heterostructures of doped graphene and MoX2 (X = S and Se) as promising anchoring materials for lithium-sulfur batteries: a first-principles study	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ANODE MATERIAL; 1ST PRINCIPLES; POROUS CARBON; 2D MATERIALS; LI; POLYSULFIDES; CATHODE; IMMOBILIZATION; BOROPHENE; NITROGEN	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high theoretical energy density. However, the detrimental shuttle effect is a main obstacle that greatly hampers the wide commercial applications of Li-S batteries. Introducing suitable anchoring materials to immobilize soluble Li2Sn species is an effective strategy to alleviate this challenge. Herein, by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we theoretically designed a class of heterostructure as anchoring materials for Li-S batteries, which is composed of the stacking between a transition metal dichalcogenide (MoX2, X = S and Se) monolayer and B- or N-doped graphene. We found that these heterostructures show outstanding anchoring performance for soluble Li2Sn species due to the remarkable binding strength with a suitable range of binding energies from 1.20 to 2.05 eV induced by charge transfer, thus effectively anchoring the soluble Li2Sn species to avoid their dissolution into electrolytes and save their structural intactness. In addition, the diffusion of Li atoms on the surface of these heterostructures exhibits a low energy barrier, facilitating the electrochemical process. Thus, these proposed heterostructures are a novel class of promising anchoring material for Li-S batteries.

J	Lu, LQ; Pei, F; Abeln, T; Pei, YT				Lu, Liqiang; Pei, Fei; Abeln, Thom; Pei, Yutao			Tailoring three-dimensional interconnected nanoporous graphene micro/nano-foams for lithium-sulfur batteries	CARBON			English	Article							CARBON; CATHODE; SIZE; CONVERSION; ELECTRODE; FACILE; NICKEL; GROWTH; METAL	Three-dimensional interconnected nanoporous graphene (NPG) microfoams and nanofoams are developed via a new approach of solid-state catalytic growth. Both NPG microfoam and nanofoam exhibit similar nanoporous structures that contain close tubular pores and open non-tubular pores but with different particle sizes. As electrochemical reactors for sulfur cathodes, sulfur is encapsulated inside the tubular pores. It is found that NPG nanoreactors can enhance the electrochemical performances in comparison with NPG microreactors, including improved reversible capacities, cyclic performances and rate performances in particular. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis reveals that NPG nanoreactors facilitate Li+ transportation and decrease the charge-transfer resistance in comparison with the microreactors, promoting the redox kinetics of multi-step conversions between sulfur and lithium sulfides. This work demonstrates a significant particle size effect of nanoporous graphene on the Li-S electrochemistry and can be useful for designing Li-S batteries as well as other electrochemical energy storage systems.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is still impeded by the poor cycling performance and rate capability at practical conditions. In order to improve the performance of practical Li-S batteries, a hierarchical Mo2C nanocluster/carbon nanosheets hybrid based hollow spherical material (Mo2C/CHS) is designed and prepared. The hollow spheres composed of stacked carbon nanosheets can facilitate the infiltration of electrolyte. The ultrasmall and highly conductive Mo2C nanocrystals are confined in the carbon nanosheets and expose more active sites for anchoring and conversion of lithium polysulfides and increase the number of the nuclei for Li2S2/Li2S precipitation. Benefitting from the synergistic effects, Mo2C/CHS greatly promotes electrochemical kinetics in Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading (5 mg cm(-2)). Even under lean electrolyte conditions (E/S = 7 mu L mg(sulfur)(-1)), the Li-S batteries with Mo2C/CHS added exhibit a discharge capacity of 904 mAh g(-1) at the high current rate of 0.5 C, and with 894 mAh g(-1) maintained after 200 cycles. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical processes and guides the rational design of host and additive materials for practical Li-S batteries.

The G-S composite cathode with an ALD-Al2O3 coating delivered a high specific capacity of 646 mA h g(-1) after 100 charge-discharge cycles at 0.5 C, and this value is about twice that of the bare G-S composite. The rate capability and coulombic efficiency of the G-S composite electrode were also greatly increased. The ALD-Al2O3 coating worked as an artificial barrier to suppress the dissolution of polysulfides and alleviate the shuttle effect; thus, it effectively improved the performance of a G-S composite cathode in a Li-S battery.

However, their poor cyclability caused by the shuttle effect in ether-based electrolytes remains a great challenge for their practical application. Herein, a novel electrolyte is proposed by combining widely used carbonate solvents diethyl carbonate/fluoroethylene carbonate and inert diluent 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether for Li-S batteries based on typical mesoporous carbon/sulfur (KB/S) materials. Differing from the conventional dissolution-precipitation mechanism, the sulfur cathodes demonstrate a solid-phase reaction route in the developed electrolyte, which is realized with the assistance of an in situ formed compact cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film on the cathode caused by the nucleophilic reaction between lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and carbonate solvents. The formed CEI film can effectively block the infiltration of carbonate solvents and can completely suppress the generation of LiPSs, thus eliminating the shuttle effect. As a result, the KB/S electrode demonstrates a stable cycling performance at 2 C by maintaining a discharge capacity of 570 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles, corresponding to an average capacity decay of 0.057% per cycle. More significantly, this strategy provides a new pathway toward future development of Li-S batteries based on solid-phase conversion.

Here, we demonstrate a "microporous covalent organic framework (COF) net on mesoporous carbon nanotube (CNT) net" hybrid architecture as a new class of molecularly designed, hierarchical porous chemical trap for lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx) in Li-S batteries. As a proof of concept for the hybrid architecture, self-standing COF-net on CNT-net interlayers (called "NN interlayers") are fabricated through CNT-templated in situ COF synthesis and then inserted between sulfur cathodes and separators. Two COFs with different micropore sizes (COF-1 (0.7 nm) and COF-5 (2.7 nm)) are chosen as model systems. The effects of the pore size and (boron-mediated) chemical affinity of microporous COF nets on Li2Sx adsorption phenomena are theoretically investigated through density functional theory calculations. Benefiting from the chemical/structural uniqueness, the NN interlayers effectively capture Li2Sx without impairing their ion/electron conduction. Notably, the COF-1 NN interlayer, driven by the well-designed microporous structure, allows for the selective deposition/dissolution (i.e., facile solid liquid conversion) of electrically inert Li2Sx. As a consequence, the COF-1 NN interlayer provides a significant improvement in the electrochemical performance of Li-S cells (capacity retention after 300 cycles (at charge/discharge rate = 2.0 C/2.0 C) = 84% versus 15% for a control cell with no interlayer) that lies far beyond those accessible with conventional Li-S technologies.

Herein, a strong mitigation toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) adsorption/catalysis is achieved by introducing iron phthalocyanine (FePc) as an effective additive for high-performance graphene-based Li-S batteries. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) acts as conductive infrastructure to ensure adequate electron transport and smooth electrolyte accessibility, while the additional conjugate molecule functions as active sites to accelerate the reactions kinetic, enhance the conversion process, and thus effectively inhibit the shuttling of LiPSs. By coupling FePc with rGO through pi-pi stacking interaction, the fabricated electrode with 10 wt.% of FePc exhibits a high initial discharge capacity (1307 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C) and a superior cyclic stability (a low capacity fading rate of 0.049% per cycle over 500 cycles at 0.5 C). The proposed hybridization strategy will offer new ways for achieving high-stable and long-lifetime Li-S batteries.

Li-S batteries are considered one of the most promising energy storage devices but suffer from shortcomings, such as their rapid capacity decay, short cycle life, and low Coulomb efficiency. We designed and prepared a new type of sulfur cathode material (NC@CoP-Co3O4) that consisted of a CoP-Co3O4 heterojunction uniformly distributed on the surface of hollow nitrogen-doped carbon tubes to overcome these problems. The NC@CoP-Co3O4 hybrid nanocomposite can provide excellent electrical conductivity and effectively suppress the shuttle effect through the synergetic effect of physical confinement and chemical bonding. As a result, the Li-S battery maintained a capacity of 476 mAh g(-1) at 700 cycles at 1 C and a long-term cycle stability of 70.3% after 700 cycles with an average capacity decay rate of only 0.057% per cycle.

However, problems such as poor conductivity of sulfur (S) and "shuttle effect" hinder the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this work, dithiothreitol (DTT) was used as a coating to form a 3D crosslinked network structure with aramid paper (AP) interlayer and inhibiting the notorious shuttle effect. DTT assisted scission of disulfide bond (-S-S- bonds) in high-order polysulfides to inhibit the diffusion of polysulfides, and the loose porous AP interlayer can significantly enhance the utilization of active substances. The successful combination of DTT and AP interlayer showed significant synergistic effect, which improved the electrochemical performance of the Li-S batteries, leading to the discharge-specific capacity of 697 mAh/g at 5C.

To achieve this, the present work proposes using PEDOT-PSS to encapsulate sulfur/carbon black (S/BP) by a facile solution mixing method and the formed composite is then coated on a porous carbon paper. It is believed that the formation of a core/shell structure in the PEDOT@S/BP composite can promote the electron transport and effectively impede the diffusion of polysulfides, and the porous carbon paper is able to retain the electrolyte containing the dissolved polysulfides in the cathode and alleviate the adverse effect of sulfur volumetric expansion. Due to such advantages, the proposed cathode, with a high sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2), can yield a high reversible capacity of 1041 mA h g(-1) and an excellent cycle stability with a capacity retention of 868 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.4%.

Herein, the dependence of the Li-S battery performance on the C/S ratio is examined for various electrolyte-to-sulfur (E/S) ratios based on experimentally measured peak discharge capacities and cycling performance aside from the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities projected by the cell- and system-level performance models. C/S ratio has a great influence on the cycling performance and discharge capacity, particularly for cells with a limited amount of electrolyte. The Li-S cell having a C/S ratio of 2 and an E/S ratio of 13 mu L mg(-1) has provided the highest initial capacity in addition to the best capacity retention. Model predictions suggest that increasing C/S ratio worsens the battery metrics at the pack level, particularly at low E/S ratios. Assessment of the performance based on the energy density is highly important; the best battery performance at the system level is calculated for the Li-S battery with the lowest E/S and C/S ratios despite that a lower discharge capacity has been achieved with this cell.

One research strategy is to use graphene to improve its performance. Theoretical studies have found that heteroatom-modified graphene can effectively anchor lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and weaken the shuttle effect. In this study, we combine small sulfur molecules with the 10-heteroatom-doped graphene (h-G, where h = N, O, S, P, or B), and the shuttle effect is largely suppressed by preventing the formation of long-chain LiPSs using density functional theory. The deformation charge density and projected density of state verified that the critical interaction between h-G and LiPSs is the interaction of the lithium atom with the benzene ring and the interaction of the lithium atom with the heteroatom. In addition, the effect of solvation on the adsorption of the LiPSs on h-G is studied. Remarkably, in solvent, the binding energies of polysulfides on pyridine, epoxy, and B-doped graphene were still the largest, indicating that they may be the ideal lithium-sulfur battery cathode materials for suppressing the shuttle effect. This study provides key insights into the underlying mechanism by which h-G with small sulfur molecules contributes to the intrinsic shuttle inhibition and traps the polysulfides.

The TiO2 coated carbon sulfur composite thin slice works as a binder-free cathode without any current collectors for lithium sulfur batteries. The hierarchical architecture provides a 3D conductive network for electron transfer, open channels for ion diffusion and strong confinement of soluble polysulfides. Meanwhile, TiO2 (titanium dioxide) coating layer could further effectively prevent the dissolution of polysulfides and also improve the strength of the entire electrode, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance. As a result, after TiO2 coating, the electrode demonstrates excellent cycling performance, with a discharge capacity of 608 mAh/g at 0.2 C current rate and 500 mAh/g at 1 C current rate after 120 cycles, respectively.

The dissolution of lithium polysulfides (Li2Sm), which are discharge products of elemental sulfur, was significantly suppressed in the solvate ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, as seen in [Li(G(4))][BETI] and [Li(glyme)][TFSA], wherein all of the glymes participated in the formation of the complex cation [Li(glyme)](+). It was found that NO3 anions were irreversibly reduced at the composite cathode during discharge and BF4 anions formed unexpected byproducts through a chemical reaction with the polysulfide anions. Successful charge/discharge of Li-S cell could not be performed in [Li(glyme)]X in the presence of these anions because of the undesired side reactions. The solvate IL [Li(G4)][BETI] was found to be electrochemically stable in the Li-S cell and allowed a stable operation with a capacity of 600700 mAh.g(-1) and a Coulombic efficiency of 98.5% over 100 cycles, similar to that achieved by [Li(glyme)][TFSA]. In contrast, the Li-S cell with a concentrated electrolyte solution, [Li(G3)][OTf], showed a much lower capacity and Coulombic efficiency.

However, Li-S batteries have failed to achieve commercial success, due to the rapid capacity fading with cycling caused mainly by the "shuttle'' phenomenon. Here, we report a feasible approach to mitigate this issue using a porous aromatic framework (PAF) as a hosting substrate in Li-S batteries. As a cathode material, the composite of PAF with sulfur exhibits high capacity and excellent cycling stability in both a sulfone electrolyte, 1.0 M LiPF6-MiPS, and an ionic liquid electrolyte, 0.5 M LiTFSI-MPPY center dot TFSI.

Complex structures with multiple components have been widely employed to address these issues by virtue of their strong polarity and abundant surface catalytic sites. Nevertheless, the tedious constructing procedures and high cost of these materials make the exploration of alternative high-performance sulfur hosts increasingly important. Herein, we report an intrinsic defect-rich hierarchically porous carbon architecture with strong affinity and high conversion activity toward polysulfides even at high sulfur loading. Such an architecture can be prepared using a widely available nitrogen-containing precursor through a simple yet effective in situ templating strategy and subsequent nitrogen removal procedure. The hierarchical structure secures a high sulfur loading, while the intrinsic defects strongly anchor the active species and boost their chemical conversion because of the strong polarity and accelerated electron transfer at the defective sites. As a result, the lithium-sulfur batteries with this carbon material as the sulfur host deliver a high specific capacity of 1182 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 70% after 500 cycles, and outstanding rate capability, one of the best results among pure carbon hosts. The strategy suggested here may rekindle interest in exploring the potential of pure carbon materials for lithium-sulfur batteries as well as other energy storage devices.

Nevertheless, the insulating nature of sulfur and notorious polysulfide shuttling result in low sulfur utilization and short cycling life. In recent years, various carbon structures have been reported as effective sulfur hosts to tolerate volume expansion, prevent polysulfide dissolution and enhance electrical conductivity. It is hard for carbon materials, however, to satisfy all these aspects with a simple structural design. Thus, developing hierarchical carbon structures that serve as a multi-functional host is necessary for high-performance LIS batteries. Herein, we reported a facile method to prepare a three-dimensional carbon nanofiber (3DCNF) through a hydrothermal reaction. With the structural advantages, the 3DCNF and sulfur composite delivered a capacity as high as 1266 and 977 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 and 0.5 C, respectively. After 500 cycles at 0.5 C, it still retains a capacity of 607 mA h g(-1) (0.07% capacity fading per cycle), exhibiting excellent cycling capability.

However, its application has been restricted by the isolating properties of sulfur (S), as well as S shuttle effect, S volume effect, and low electron conductivity. In this work, the amorphous sulfur-reduced graphene oxide (S/rGO) composite cathode material was prepared with a smaller particle size of about 2 nm S onto rGO to alleviate the volume effect of S (after 30 cycles, the charge transfer impedance changes about only 3 omega); at the same time, highly conductive rGO maintain good ionic conduction during charge-discharge cycling. Along with the cathode material, we fabricated a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) based on poly (ethylene oxide), lithium-ion conductor Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12-succinonitrile (PEO18- LiTFSI-LLZO-SN) possessing lithium conductivities of 1.16 x 10-4 and 7.26 x 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature and 60 degrees C, respectively, which can mitigate the transport of polysulfide and be suitable for battery applications. The composite cathode material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 783mAh g-1 at 45 degrees C, with a capacity retention rate of 81.2% at 0.2C after 60 cycles. At 60 degrees C, the battery shows excellent electrochemical cyclability 820mAh g-1 of reserved capacity after stable operation for 100 cycles at 0.2C. The synergy between the CPE and the amorphous S/rGO composite cathode demonstrated in this work may bring insights to improve the cycling performance of all-solid-state Li-S batteries	[Chen, Fei; Puente, P.

A new one-step process is proposed firstly to decrease the concentration of SSC and to assemble a high-performance sulfur cathode synchronously by electrolyzing a simulating solution with flexible carbon felt (CF) at 15mAcm(-2). The CF that electrolyzed for 8 hours with a sulfur content of 36.6 wt% or 5.63 mg(sulfur)cm(-2) stands out from three S/CF composites in terms of areal capacity and cycling stability. XRD, TEM, thermogravimetric analysis, and Raman spectroscopy were then used to characterize the materials. Values of 4.03 mAhcm(-2) over 150 cycles at 0.2C and 2.34 mAhcm(-2) after 90 cycles at 0.5 C can be attributed to an appropriate ratio of the external/inner sulfur content. The beneficial results prove the feasibility of an innovative mode of "pollutant disposal with synchronous application", which integrates environmental management with the development of storage energy materials efficiently and eliminates the tedious individual disposal of pollutants and preparation of slurry-derived sulfur cathodes.

Ordered Mesoporous Graphitic Carbon/Iron Carbide Composites with High Porosity as a Sulfur Host for Li-S Batteries	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						mesoporous materials; lithium-sulfur battery; long cyclability; graphitic carbon; high porosity	X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON; HIGH-CAPACITY; NANOFIBER WEBS; GRAPHENE; FRAMEWORKS; ELECTRODE; SILICA	The lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) is a promising candidate for future energy storage but faces technological challenges including the low electronic conductivity of sulfur and the solubility of intermediates during cycling. Additionally, current host materials often lack sufficient conductivity and porosity to raise the sulfur loading to over 80 wt %. Here, ordered mesoporous graphitic carbon/iron carbide nanocomposites were prepared via an evaporation-induced self-assembly process using soluble resol, prehydrolyzed tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and iron(III) chloride as the carbon, silica (SiO2), and iron precursors, respectively. Graphitization and SiO2 etching were conducted simultaneously via Teflon-assisted, solid-state decomposition at high temperature. A high surface area (similar to 3100 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (similar to 3.3 cm(3) g(-1)), and graphitized carbon frame were achieved, giving a high sulfur loading (85 wt %) while tolerating volumetric expansion during discharge. Electrochemical testing of a LSB containing the composite/sulfur cathode exhibited a superior reversible capacity exceeding 1300 mAh g(-1) at a moderate current (C/10) and a low decay in capacity of 9% after 500 cycles at C/5. The interaction between mesoporous graphitic carbon and sulfur is proposed.

The DPC with special pore feature is synthesized through carbonizing durian shell and activating by KOH, and then the sulfur is encapsulated into hierarchical porous carbon (DPC/S) successfully for the cathode material. The synthesis conditions of alkali/carbon ratio and activation temperature have important influence on the pore features of DPC and the electrochemical performance of DPC/S composites. When the activation temperature is 900 degrees C, the pore volume of 4DPC with the alkali/carbon ratio of 4 is 1.6 cm3 g & minus;1 while the range of pore size distribution is 0.5-20 nm. At a current density of 0.5C, the discharge capacity of 4DPC-900/ S reaches 604 mAh g & minus;1 after 100 cycles. Not only the pore volume can influence on the electrochemical performance of DPC/S composites, but the pore size distribution plays an important role as well.

Therefore, it could replace the LIBs in the market for the electric vehicles. However, there are still problems to hinder the wide application of the lithium-sulfur batteries. The main issues are including the insulation of the element sulfur and the dissolution of the soluble polysulfide during the discharging and charging process. For overcoming these problems, many works have been conducted, such as preparing the advanced S-based cathode materials, designing the multifunctional separators and interlayers between the cathode and lithium anode. Herein, wheat biomass-derived carbon materials were prepared and used as sulfur host materials in the lithium-sulfur batteries. Owing to high electronic conductivity as well as abundant active site of carbon materials, the as-prepared carbon/S composites could accelerate the polysulfide conversion and the electrode reaction kinetics. As a result, the as-prepared carbon/S composites exhibit superior rate performance and outstanding cycling stability as cathode materials during the electrochemical cycles.

J	Yi, GS; Sim, ES; Chung, YC				Yi, Gyu Seong; Sim, Eun Seob; Chung, Yong-Chae			Effect of lithium-trapping on nitrogen-doped graphene as an anchoring material for lithium-sulfur batteries: a density functional theory study	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; CARBON; POLYSULFIDES; COMPOSITE; MECHANISM; SHUTTLE	N-Doped graphene (NG) has been widely used as a cathode material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries due to its strong interaction with lithium polysulfide (LiPS) species. However, strong interaction between the NG substrate and the LiPS molecules induces undesirable molecular structure decomposition of LiPS. Due to the strong interaction between Li and NG, Li-trapping occurs during battery operation. Therefore, in this study, Li-trapped NG (LiNG) is introduced as a possible structure of NG, and the structural stability of LiNG under applied electric potential is examined. The effect of Li-trapping on the properties of NG as an anchoring material for Li-S batteries is investigated using density functional theory calculations. Li-trapping relieves the strong interaction between NG and LiPS, thereby avoiding decomposition of the LiPS molecule. Although the interaction between the LiPS molecule and the substrate is weakened, additionally formed interaction after Li-trapping, which is between Li in the substrate and S in the molecule, enables LiNG to suppress the shuttle effect. LiNG shows advanced anchoring behavior that suppresses the shuttle effect without any molecular decomposition of LiPS. This finding provides a further understanding of the effect of Li-trapping on the anchoring properties of NG for Li-S batteries.

Scannirig and transmission electron microscopy images reveal a 3D hierarchial sandwich-type architecture of the composite GS-MWCNTOS. The thickness of the S layer on the MWCNTs is similar to 20 nm. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis confirm that the sulfur in the composite is highly crystalline with a mass loading up to 70% of the composite. This composite is evaluated as a cathode material for Li/S batteries. The GS-MVVCNT@S composite exhibits a high initial capacity of 1396 mAh/g at a current density of 0.2C (1C = 1672 mA/g), corresponding to 83% usage of the sulfur active material. Much improved cycling stability and rate capability are achieved for the GS-MWCNT@S composite cathode compared with the composite lacking GS or MWCNT. The superior electrochemical performance of the GS-MWCNT@S composite is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of GS and MWCNTs, which provide a 3D conductive network for electron transfer, open channels for ion diffusion, strong confinement of soluble polysulfides, and effective buffer for volume expansion of the S cathode during discharge.

However, the shuttle effect of soluble intermediates, lithium polysulfides, results in a loss of active materials and sluggish redox kinetics, hampering the cyclability and rate capability of Li-S batteries. Here, we apply the commercial polypropylene separators modified with a 3D Ti3C2Tx aerogel to resolve the issues in Li-S batteries. This special structure of the Ti3C2Tx aerogel not only effectively avoids the restacking phenomenon of 2D Ti3C2Tx materials to expose more active surface and anchor lithium polysulfides but also increases the reaction kinetics of high-order lithium polysulfides to low-order lithium polysulfides, due to the high conductivity of Ti3C2Tx surfaces. Due to the high specific surface area and the 3D structure, the Li-S batteries with 3D Ti3C2Tx aerogel-functionalized separators exhibit superior performances, including a high discharge capacity of 1487 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, a long cycling stability, and a low decay rate of 0.037% per cycle at 1 C for 1500 cycles.

Herein, for the first time, a composite of carbon nanofibers decorated with MnO nanoparticles (CNF-MnO) has been prepared by the facile electrospinning method followed by thermal treatment. SEM and TEM characterization delivered that the MnO NPs on CNF did not change the morphology but decrease the electronic conductivity of CNF-MnO composite. The CNF-MnO composite exhibited excellent electrochemical cyclic stability because of its strong chemical absorption for polysulfide. Interestingly, CNF-MnO composite served as both cathode as well interlayer for Li-S batteries.

This hybrid electrolyte possesses abundant mesopores (2.8 nm), thin feature (20 mu m), and high ionic conductivity (1.17 x 10(-1) mS cm(-1)) as well as a low interfacial resistance with electrodes. Such unique features not only enable the efficient inhibition of the growth of lithium dendrites, but also significantly prevents polysulfide shuttling. Consequently, a Li-S battery with this hybrid electrolyte exhibits a relatively high reversible capacity and good capacity retention.

The huge volumetric change of sulfur (ca. 80% increase in volume) in the cathode during discharge is one of the factors affecting the battery performance, which can be remedied with a binder. Herein, a self-crosslinking polyacrylate latex (PAL) is synthesized and used as a binder for the sulfur cathode of a Li-S battery to keep the cathode structure stable. The synthesized PAL has nano-sized latex particles and a low glass transition temperature (T-g), which will ensure a uniform dispersion and good adhesion in the cathode. This crosslinking structure can provide fine elasticity to recover from the deformation due to volumetric change. The stable cathode structure, stemming from the fine elasticity of the PAL binder, can facilitate ion migration and diffusion to decrease the polarization. Therefore, the Li-S batteries with the PAL binder can function well with excellent cycling stability and superior C-rate performance.

However, the low sulfur utilization and the shuttle effect of polysulfide cause low initial capacity and serious capacity decay. Herein, fluorinated graphite (FG) is introduced to the cathode to alleviate these issues. The results indicated that the FG could provide additional capacity during the first discharge process and increase the porosity and polarity of the cathode via in situ formation of lithium fluoride (LiF) nanocrystals, which can enhance the infiltration of electrolyte and polysulfide adsorption. As a result, the as-prepared cathode containing FG shows a high initial specific capacity of 1602 mA h g(-1) and the reversible specific capacity is 650 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C after 300 cycles. Moreover, its specific capacity remains at 860 mA h g(-1) at 5C, which is 367% higher than that of the sample without FG. This paper provides a new strategy to improve the energy density and the cycle stability of Li-S batteries.

Synthesis and elevated temperature performance of a polypyrrole-sulfur-multi-walled carbon nanotube composite cathode for lithium sulfur batteries	IONICS			English	Article						Polypyrrole/sulfur/MWCNTcomposite; Elevated temperature performance; Lithium-sulfur battery; Cathode material; EIS	ENHANCED ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES; ELECTROLYTE; NANOCOMPOSITE; GRAPHENE; LINO3; IMPROVEMENT; STABILITY; CELLS	A sulfur-multi-walled carbon nanotube composite (S/MWCNT) was prepared using a two-step procedure of liquid-phase infiltration and melt diffusion. Polypyrrole (PPy) conductive polymer was coated on the surface of the as-prepared S/MWCNT composite by in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomer to obtain PPy/S/MWCNT composite. The composite materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared cathode material was investigated at 25, 40, and 70 degrees C at various rates. It was found that temperature has dual effects on the performance of Li/S cells. Increasing the temperature, on one hand, facilitates the lithium ion transport through the cathode and, on the other hand, leads to faster dissolution of active material into the electrolyte. The PPy coating can effectively trap polysulfides in its porous structure, even at elevated temperatures, leading to the improvement of the discharge capacity, the cycle stability, and the coulombic efficiency. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results reveal that the PPy coating reduces the formation of passive layer on the cathode surface, even at high temperatures, resulting in a better elevated temperature performance. A high reversible capacity of 945 mAh g(-1) was maintained after 50 cycles for the PPy/S/MWCNT composite at 70 degrees C at a rate of 0.5 C.

Sulfur is homogeneously embedded into the carbon nanosheet by an in situ hybridization process, which enhances the electron and ion transportation due to the higher electronic conductivity and morphology, respectively. The solid solvothermal reaction provides insight into the unique chemical-state of the sulfur content in the sulfur-carbon hybrids due to the small difference in electronegativity between sulfur and carbon contents. This characteristic effect on the production of electrolyte-dissoluble lithium sulfide in the electrochemical reaction can enhance the cycle performance of the hybrid as a cathode material in LiS batteries. The SCNHs show improved electrochemical performance of 810 mA h g (1) at 100 mA g (1) and excellent Coulombic efficiency close to 100% at a high rate.

Recently, binary metal sulfides as electrode materials have been used for miscellaneous application accounting for their larger redox reaction sites and higher electrical conductivity. Herein, a novel urchin-like NiCo2S4 was synthesized via two steps of hydrothermal process and then firstly used as a conductive and polar host for sulfur in lithium sulfur batteries. The obtained NiCo2S4/S composite demonstrates a capacity of 1028mAhg(-1) for the first discharge and maintains 421mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1C. Furthermore, the composite still shows a remarkable cycling stability at a higher rate, a low capacity fade rate of 0.18% per cycle can be achieved and a reversible capacity of 329mAhg(-1) can be obtained after 300 cycles at 1C. This excellent performance results from a weakened polysulfide shuttle caused by a strong affinity between NiCo2S4 and polysulfides.

Self-Discharge Behavior of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries at Different Electrolyte/Sulfur Ratios	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th International Meeting on Lithium Batteries (IMLB)	JUN 17-22, 2018	Kyoto, JAPAN				ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; POLYSULFIDE; CAPACITY; CATHODE; ANODE; SHUTTLE; CARBON; LINO3; CELL; PRECIPITATION	The commercialization of lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries is hindered by their poor cycling performance, including fast capacity fade, low Coulombic efficiency, and high self-discharge rate. The static electrochemical stability of Li-S batteries, which is usually described in terms of their self-discharge properties, was much less studied compared to the dynamic electrochemical stability under continuous cycling. In this article, a set of experiments designed to understand the correlation between the self-discharge process and various operational conditions were made by using freestanding carbon nanotube foams as cathodes. We found a strong dependence of the self-discharge rate on the depth of discharge and on the electrolyte/sulfur ratio. We show that the effects of the self-discharge on the subsequent discharge capacities of Li-S cells are closely related to the type and concentration of lithium polysulfide species in the electrolyte and their interaction with the Li anode. This relation is analyzed in detail in this article, showing that one should pay special attention to the state-of-charge during self-discharge and the other operational conditions in order to improve the cyclability and capacity of Li-S batteries. In addition, we also highlight the importance of an efficient anode protection to improve the static electrochemical stability of these batteries. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

Correlations between precipitation reactions and electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries probed by operando scattering techniques	CHEM			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; ANGLE X-RAY; HETEROGENEITY; BINDER; CELLS	A comprehensive description of electrochemical processes in the positive electrode of lithium-sulfur batteries is crucial for the utilization of active material. However, the discharge mechanisms are complicated due to various reactions in multiple phases and the tortuosity of the highly porous carbon matrix. In this work, simultaneous measurements of small-angle and wide-angle scattering and cell resistance are performed on operating lithium-sulfur cells. Results indicate that precipitates grow mostly in number, not in size, and that the structure of the carbon matrix is not affected. The comparison of the small-angle and wide-angle scattering reveals the amorphous discharge products found at a low discharge rate. Further analysis demonstrates the correlation between the diffusion resistance and the compositional change of electrolyte in the mesopores at the end of discharge, which suggests that Li-ion deficiency is the limiting factor for sulfur utilization at a medium discharge rate.

However, the low utilization of insulated active materials and shuttle effect have severely hindered the further development of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, MoO(2)nanoparticles embedded in N-doped hydrangea-like carbon have been synthesized by liquid-phase reaction followed by an annealing process and used as a sulfur host. The nitrogen-doped carbon matrix improves electrical conductivity and provides pathways for smooth electron and Li ion transfer to uniformly dispersed sulfur. Meanwhile, MoO(2)nanoparticles can absorb polysulfide ions by forming strong chemical bonds, which can effectively alleviate the polysulfide shuttling effect. These results showed a good rate performance: 1361, 1071, 925, 815 and 782 mA h g(-1)at the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g(-1), and capacity retention of 85% after 300 cycles at 1 A g(-1). The excellent performance was due to the synergistic effects of the polar MoO(2)and nitrogen-doped carbon matrix, which can effectively restrain and reutilize active materials by absorbing polysulfides and catalyzing the transformation of polysulfides.

However, severe technical problems of polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effect still prohibit the commercialization of Li-S batteries. This review focuses on the recent advances of polysulfide mediation in conventional Li-S batteries with liquid electrolytes. Simple yet effective solutions to control polysulfide dissolution and shuttling via facile modification of the cathode and the electrolyte are highlighted. The rational design of cathode composition, the use of polysulfide barrier layers, and the selection of electrolyte components are discussed. These strategies offer significant promise to address the challenges and increase the viability of the large-scale application of Li-S batteries. (c) 2019 Author(s).

However, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish conversion kinetics during charge/discharge cycling impede the LSBs. Herein, we employed the nanocage-like nitrogen-rich metal organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon decorated with an iron single-atom (FeSA-CN) catalyst to trigger the surface-mediated reaction of LiPSs. The synergistic effect from the iron single atom (FeSA) and nitrogen-rich porous carbon significantly boost the reaction kinetics and utilization of the sulfur species. The FeSA-CN/S electrode delivered a specific capacity of 1123 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, and exhibited an excellent rate performance of 605 mA h g(-1) at 4.0C with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle for 500 cycles. This work provides an effective strategy to couple the function of a nanoporous material host and single-atom catalyst for lithium sulfur batteries.

Particle atomic layer deposition as an effective way to enhance Li-S battery energy density	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Lithium-sulfur battery; Sulfur ccathode; High loading; Atomic layer deposition; Magnesium-sulfur battery	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; INVERSE VULCANIZATION; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; BINDER; AL2O3; ELECTRODE; GRAPHENE	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are the most promising candidates for succeeding lithium ion batteries. However, they present some challenges which should be faced to increase its commercial possibilities as detrimental mechanisms during operation (e.g. shuttle effect, low capacity retention, anode corrosion, and so on) and sulfur cathode processing limitations (e.g. poor mechanical stability of S cathodes, defects, low S loading, and so on). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) with alumina (Al2O3) has been extensively applied to sulfur cathode surfaces to improve the electrochemical behavior of Li-S technology as it minimizes discharge product dissolution and hence, it reduces detrimental mechanisms during operation. However, the improvement of sulfur cathode processing still remains unsolved even high-cost approaches have been proposed in the state of the art which unfortunately are not viable for realistic applications. In the present work, for first time, ALD in a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) is carried out to coat sulfur-carbon (S/C) composite particles with Al2O3 before electrode manufacturing. The present approach provides a precise control of S/C composite agglomeration, which improves sulfur cathode processing while maintaining the well known satisfactory operational mechanisms related to Al2O3 coating. We reported on the economic FBR-ALD technique in a promising strategy for high specific energy density Li S battery with an increased sulfur loading being, double of that obtained for a standard sulfur cathode (3.6 vs. 1.8 mg(sulfur) cm(-2)).

However, the poor electrical conductivity of sulfur cathodes and the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides during cycling strongly hinder the commercial application of Li-S batteries. In this study, Magn ' eli phase Ti4O7 nanoparticles were successfully prepared on the surface of hollow carbon spheres (HCS) through a carbothermal reduction reaction. The synthesized HCS@ Ti4O7 with a mesoporous structure exhibited a uniform spherical morphology with a large specific surface area (512 m2 g-1) and the pore volume of 0.58 cm3 g-1. The introduction of a polydopamine (PDA) layer during the preparation was confirmed to effectively inhibit the grain coarsening of Ti4O7. Moreover, the high content of sulfur loading (70%) did not affect the morphology of HCS@ Ti4O7, which suggested its stable architecture. The assembled coin cells exhibited the superior reversible capacity of 1427 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and favorable cycling stability from 1168 mAh g-1 to 601 mAh g-1 after 800 cycles at 0.5C with the capacity decay rate of only 0.06% per cycle. This excellent performance and stability were attributed to the strong chemical binding effects of Ti4O7 on lithium polysulfides and the stable morphology maintenance during cycling. This study provides a novel conception to design and synthesize nanocomposites between reduced metal oxides and carbon with uniform and stable mesoporous structures for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The as-prepared MoO2 nanospheres are used as efficient sulfur matrix in lithium-sulfur battery to improve its electrochemical performance. Higher capacity retention and better rate performance can be achieved, compared with the acetylene black/sulfur cathode, which can be attributed to the conductive MoO2 nanospheres uniformly dispersed in sulfur, enhancing electron transfer and reducing interfacial impedance. The MoO2/S composite cathode exhibit a discharge capacity of 1144 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 2.2 mA cm(-2) in the first cycle, and maintained 780 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. Furthermore, even under a rate of 4.4 mA cm(-2), it still maintained a substantial capacity of 635 mAh g(-1). It is demonstrated that the addition of mesoporous MoO2 improving electrochemical performances of the batteries, which effectively slowed down the dissolution of polysulfides in the electrolyte and shorten the diffusion distances for lithium ions on interaction during the charge-discharge processes.

To solve these issues, free-standing chromium carbide-modified carbon nanofiber (Cr3C2/CNF) electrocatalytic membrane for Li/S batteries is in situ synthesized by solution impregnation method with ammonium chromate ((NH4)(2)CrO4) and carbothermal reduction technology. CNFs provide fast pathways for electron transfer and lithium ions diffusion, promote the catalytic conversion, and restrain the shuttle effect. Cr3C2 nanoparticles in situ grow on the surface of the CNFs and play a role in adsorbing and catalyzing the conversion of lithium polysulfides. Due to advantage structure, Cr3C2/CNFs@Li2S6 electrode (sulfur loading: 4.74 mg) exhibits excelled cycling stability (initial discharge capacity: 977 mAh g(-1); 828 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C over 300 cycles). Even at high sulfur loading of 7.11 mg, the composite electrode also shows high capacity (6.11 mAh). The above results provide an effective route for high performance of Li/S batteries.

The proposed hybrid structure showing high surface area (870 m(2).g(-1)) and high B-dopant content (6.51 wt.%) simultaneously offers both physical confinement and chemical absorption of polysulfides. On one hand, the abundant-pore structure ensures high sulfur loading, facilitates fast charge transfer, and restrains polysulfide migration during cycling. On the other hand, our density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the B dopant is capable of chemically binding polysulfides. As a consequence of such dual polysulfide confinement, the BPCS-G/S cathode prepared with 70 wt.% sulfur loading presents a high reversible capacity of 1,174 mAh.g(-1) at 0.02 C, a high rate capacity of 396 mAh.g(-1) at 5 C, and good cyclability over 500 cycles with only 0.05% capacity decay per cycle. The present work provides an efficient and cost-effective platform for the scalable synthesis of high-performance carbon-based materials for advanced Li-S batteries.

J	Moy, D; Narayanan, SR				Moy, Derek; Narayanan, S. R.			Mixed Conduction Membranes Suppress the Polysulfide Shuttle in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; CARBON NANOTUBES; FUNDAMENTAL CHEMISTRY; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; CATHODE; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE	The shuttling of polysulfide ions between the two electrodes of a lithium-sulfur battery is a major technical issue that limits the electrical performance and cycle life of this battery. This "polysulfide shuttle" causes self-discharge, low charging efficiencies, and irreversible capacity losses. Suppressing the polysulfide shuttle will bring us closer to realizing a rechargeable battery that has two to three times the energy density of today's lithium-ion batteries. We demonstrate a novel approach to the problem of the polysulfide shuttle by using a "mixed conduction membrane" (MCM). The MCM is a thin non-porous lithium-ion conducting barrier that simply restricts the soluble polysulfides to the positive electrode. Lithium-ion conduction occurs through the MCM by electrochemical intercalation or insertion reactions and concomitant solid-state diffusion, exactly as in the cathode of a lithium-ion battery. Because of the rapidity of lithium ion transport in the MCM, the internal resistance of the battery is not higher than that of a conventional lithium-sulfur battery. The MCM is as effective as the lithium nitrate additive in suppressing the polysulfide shuttle reactions. However, unlike lithium nitrate, the MCM is not used up during cycling and thus provides extended durability and cycle life. We establish the criteria for the selection of materials for MCMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel MCM layer by proving the suppression of shuttling of polysulfides, demonstration of improved capacity retention during repeated cycling, and by the preservation of rate capability and impedance of the lithium-sulfur battery.

The binder is composed of Li+-Nafion, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and nano silica. Macroporous carbon (MPC) is employed for sulfur retention in cathode. The multi-functional binder regulates tetrasulfide movement only in MPC pores during lithiation and delithiation cycling. The resultant Li-S battery shows excellent performance in discharge capacity and rate cycleability. The sulfur lithiation capacity reaches 1373 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C (0.335 A g(-1) of S) and 470 mAh g(-1) at 5C (8.375 A g(-1) of S). A rate capacity as high as 809 mAh g(-1) has been achieved after 300 cycles at 1C charge discharge rate. The Li-S battery showed very low capacity degradation rate of 0.08% per cycle at 1C rate.

Multiple innovative approaches have recently been developed to resolve these LiPS issues. Melt-diffusion of sulfur into porous carbon is a representative solution for preventing the diffusion out of LiPSs, which aims to coordinate the sulfur on the electrochemically active site, accordingly. However, it has been overlooked that the mass transport motion of LiPSs has a crucial role in achieving high-performance. In this paper, we highlight the importance of the mass transport of soluble sulfur in the cathode structure by introducing various starting materials,i.e., solid sulfur using melt-diffusion and a catholyte, using 3-dimensional ordered macroporous carbon. The capacity of the sulfur cathode using melt-diffusion is well conserved in carbon with small pores because LiPSs are slowly diffused away, however, the catholyte derived sulfur cathode shows superior performance in carbon with large pores due to their rapid mass transport. The comparison with the four different combinations that control the pore size and mass transport reveals that proper selection of the initial state of starting materials using porous carbons demonstrates the optimal cell performance.

Here we report a possibility of having a conversion of Li2S into sulfur without detectible formation of polysulfides. That was confirmed by using a novel material system consisting of carbon coated Li2S particles prepared by carbothermal reduction of Li2SO4. Two independent in operando measurements showed direct oxidation of Li2S into sulfur for this system, with almost negligible formation of polysulfides at potentials above 2.5 V vs. Li/Li+. Our results link the diversity of first charge profiles in the literature to the Li2S oxidation mechanism and show the importance of ionic wiring within the material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Li2S oxidation mechanism depends on the relative amount of soluble sulfur in the electrolyte. By controlling the type and the amount of electrolyte within the encapsulating carbon shell, it is thereby possible to control the reaction mechanism of Li2S activation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, challenges remain in achieving fast electronic and ionic transport while accommodate the significant cathode volumetric change. On the other hand, the severe capacity decay mainly attributed to polysulfide shuttle also hampers the practical applications. Here, we report a simple, low-cost, and eco-friendly method for the one-step preparation of a binder-free S-C composite cathode by plasma dissociation of CS2 containing gases at room-temperature. The key issue of polysulfide shuttle effect in Li-S batteries is also effectively resolved just by the introduction of N-2 into the precursor gases. The electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of similar to 600 mAh/g of the total hybrid of S + C at 100 mA/g after 100 cycles with an excellent initial coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. The cells also demonstrate along cycle life and an extremely high capacity of similar to 306 mAh/g even after 300 cycles at 1 A/g with a high coulombic efficiency of about 100%. The proposed method will open the way for the plasma applications in facile preparation of Li-S batteries and the improvement of its electrochemical performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

J	Luo, L; Chung, SH; Manthiram, A				Luo, Liu; Chung, Sheng-Heng; Manthiram, Arumugam			A three-dimensional self-assembled SnS2-nano-dots@graphene hybrid aerogel as an efficient polysulfide reservoir for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							HIGH-CAPACITY; GRAPHENE; CATHODES; ANODE; OXIDE; NANOCOMPOSITES; ARCHITECTURE; NANOSHEETS; COMPOSITE; SURFACE	Reliable sulfur cathodes hold the key to realizing high-performance lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, yet the electrochemical inefficiency and instability arising from the poor conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide together with polysulfide diffusion present challenges. We present here a new three-dimensional graphene aerogel embedded with in situ grown SnS2 nano-dots (SnS2-ND@G) as an efficient sulfur host. First, benefiting from a highly conductive, hierarchically porous, and mechanically self-supported architecture, the SnS2-ND@G aerogel enables the cathode to hold high sulfur content (75 wt%) and loading (up to 10 mg cm(-2)). Both values exceed most of the reported metal-compound-related cathode work (<60 wt% sulfur content and <3 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading) in the literature. Second, this work takes advantage of a facile one-pot self-assembly fabrication, effectively guaranteeing a homogeneous deposition of SnS2 nano-dots in the graphene aerogel with a small amount of SnS2 (16 wt%). It greatly overcomes the shortcomings of physical incorporation methods to make metal-compound/carbon substrates reported in previous studies. More importantly, by rationally combining the physical entrapment from graphene and chemical adsorptivity from SnS2 nano-dots towards polysulfides, the SnS2-ND@G aerogel demonstrates remarkably improved polysulfide-trapping capability and electrochemical stability. As a result, a high peak capacity of 1234 mA h g(-1), a high reversible capacity of 1016 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles, exceptional rate capability (C/10 - 3C rates), and impressive areal capacity (up to 11 mA h cm(-2)) are achieved. This work provides a viable path to integrate a conductive graphene network and nano-sized SnS2 as a promising cathode substrate for developing advanced Li-S batteries.

Herein, we reported the encapsulation of sulfur (S) into hierarchically porous carbon nanoplates (HPCN) derived from one-step pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOF-5). HPCN with an average thickness of ca. 50 nm exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous nanostructure, high specific surface area (1645 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume (1.18 cm(3) g(-1)). When evaluated as a cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries, the HPCN-S composite demonstrates high specific capacity and excellent cycling performance. At a current rate of 0.1 C, the initial discharge capacity of HPCN-S is 1177 mA h g(-1). Even at a current rate of 0.5 C, it still delivers a discharge capacity of 730 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles and the Coulombic efficiency is up to 97%. The enhanced electrochemical performance of HPCN-S is closely related to its well-defined 3D porous plate nanostructure which not only provides stable electronic and ionic transfer channels, but also plays a key role as a strong absorbent to retain polysulfides and accommodate volume variation during the charge-discharge process.

The functionalized N-doped porous carbon nanofiber webs (N-PCNF) with an appropriate N doping (4.32 wt %) are synthesized by a facile approach, which consists of pyrolyzation of polypyrrole nanofiber and a subsequent KOH activation. Instrumental analysis shows that N-PCNF possesses a large specific surface area (2642 m(2) g(-1)) and a high inner pore volume (1.31 cm(3) g(-1)). When evaluating its electrochemical properties in a lithium-sulfur battery, the N-PCNF/S composite with 77.01 wt % sulfur content displays an excellent electrochemical performance. The specific discharge capacity still reaches 749.8 mAh g(-1) after 180 cycles at 0.2 C. At a higher rate of 1 C, the capacity stabilizes at 666.0 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles. This work demonstrates that combining the favorable aspects of N doping modification and one-dimensional nanostructure in the carbon matrix design is an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of the carbon/sulfur cathodes.

However, severe polysulfide dissolution in organic electrolytes causes low sulfur utilization, fast capacity decay and poor coulombic efficiency. Here, we report a conductive polar MoC@MoOx material for efficient polysulfide immobilization and conversion during redox reactions. The polar MoOx shell enables the chemical adsorption of polysulfides, and the conductive MoC core facilitates the conversion of polysulfides to Li2S. The incorporation of the MoC@MoOx material in a carbon fiber foam electrode results in significantly improved electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity and good cycling stability. Our approach is a proof-of-concept study of the effective role of conductive polar materials in improving the redox chemistry of Li-S batteries.

J	Fang, XZ; Jiang, Y; Zhang, KL; Hu, G; Hu, WW				Fang, Xinzuo; Jiang, Yu; Zhang, Kailong; Hu, Guang; Hu, Weiwei			MOF-derived fluorine and nitrogen co-doped porous carbon for an integrated membrane in lithium-sulfur batteries	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article								The shuttle effect of polysulfides severely blocks the cycling performance and commercial application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant porosity, nanometer cavity size, and high specific surface areas have been considered to be an effective material in inhibiting polysulfide diffusion. However, the insulation properties of MOFs and the reuse of dissolved polysulfides are still challenging. Hence, in this study, a fluorine doped ZIF-8 derived porous carbon is designed and applied as a membrane modifier to mitigate the shuttle effect and maximize reuse of the dissolved polysulfides. A comparative study of a bare membrane, ZIF-8 carbonized material (N-C-1000) coated membrane and fluorine doped ZIF-8 derived porous carbon (F-N-C-1000) coated membrane was performed. The experimental results prove that a layer of ZIF-8 derived porous carbon coated membrane does improve the capacity and cycling stability. The results also show that the optimal candidate with enhanced capacity and cycling stability should be mainly ascribed to physical adsorption (abundant porosity), chemical adsorption (fluorine and nitrogen doping) and even reuse of dissolved polysulfides by the modified membrane.

But the use of a metallic-Li anode causes serious safety hazards, such as short-circuiting and explosion of the cells. Replacing a sulfur cathode with a fully-lithiated lithium sulfide (Li2S) to pair with metallic-Li-free high-capacity anodes paves a feasible way to address this issue. However, the practical utility of Li2S cathodes faces the challenges of poor conductivity, sluggish activation process, and high sensitivity to moisture and oxygen that make electrode production more difficult than dealing with sulfur cathodes. Here, an efficient but low-cost strategy for easy production of freestanding flexible Li2S-based paper electrodes with very high mass and capacity loading in terms of in situ carbonthermal reduction of Li2SO4 by electrospinning carbon is reported. This chemistry enables high loading but strong affinity of ultrafine Li2S nanoparticles in a freestanding conductive carbon-nanofiber network, meanwhile greatly reducing the manufacturing complexity and cost of Li2S cathodes. Benefiting from enhanced structural stability and reaction kinetics, the areal specific capacities of such cathodes can be significantly boosted with less sacrificing of high-rate and cycling capability. This unique Li2S-cathode design can be directly applied for constructing metallic-Li-free or flexible Li-S batteries with high-energy density.

Various efforts have been made to synthesize a highly efficient Li2S-carbon composite; however, the electronically and ionically insulating nature and high melting point of Li2S strongly complicate the synthetic procedures, making it difficult to realize the expected capacity. Herein, a very simple method is proposed to prepare Li2S/graphene composites by one-pot pyrolysis of a mixture of graphene nanoplatelet aggregates (GNAs) and low-cost lithium sulfate (Li2SO4). For the first time, the entire pyrolysis process is clarified by thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry, wherein GNAs were found to partly serve as a carbon source to reduce Li2SO4 to Li2S, while the remaining GNAs formed thin graphene sheets as a result of this in situ etching, as a highly conductive host can immobilize the generated Li2S by intimate contact. Consequently, the obtained Li2S/graphene composite, combined with a Li2Sx-insoluble (x = 4-8) electrolyte developed by our group, exhibits excellent electrochemical behavior for Li-S batteries.

The practical implementation of lithium sulfur battery has not been realized by low discharge capacity and fast capacity decay during cycling owing to dissolution of lithium polysulfide into the electrolyte. In this work, we found that the GNS/MoS2 composites could mitigate the polysulfide dissolution and enhance the cycling stability via the MoS2 interaction. Electrochemical performances of prepared composites were evaluated in lithium batteries by galvanostatic cycling and cyclic voltammetry. When applied as the cathode in lithium sulfur batteries, GNS/MoS2 composites exhibited a high reversible capacity of 1143.4 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle and maintain a satisfactory cyclability.

While much effort has been devoted to designing the structure of sulfur cathodes for suppressing the dissolution of polysulfides, relatively little emphasis has been placed on modifying the separator. In this work, we demonstrated an approach to modify the pristine separator by coating a Ketjen Black (KB) layer, and we mainly investigated the impact of different layers of modified-separator on electrochemical performance of Li-S battery. With the three layers of modified-separator, the battery possess a high initial discharge capacity of 1430mAhg(-1) at 0.1C and deliver discharge capacities of 770mAhg(-1) and 522mAhg(-1) after 150cycles, respectively, at high rate of 2C and 4C. Moreover, when the rate is increased to 6C, the cell can also deliver a discharge capacity of 300mAhg(-1). These encouraging electrochemical results highlight the excellent rate capability and high cycle stability of Li-S battery, which could be attributed to high electron conductivity of the KB layer and the new cell configuration. This facile approach to restrain the shuttle effect of polysulfides makes further progress in obtaining enhanced performance of Li-S battery.

In the well-designed 3D architecture, the two-dimensional graphene nanosheets function as the 3D porous backbone and the one-dimensional (1D) highly conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can not only significantly enhance the conductivity, but also effectively tune the mesoporous structure. Compared to the three-dimensional graphene-sulfur (3DGS) sponge without CNTs, the conductivity of 3DCGS is enhanced by 324.7%; most importantly, compared to the monomodal mesopores (with a size of 3.5 nm) formed in the 3DG, bimodal mesopores (with sizes of 3.5 and 32.1 nm) were formed in 3DCG; the bimodal mesopores, especially the newly formed 32.1 nm mesopores, provide abundant electrochemical nanoreactors, accommodate plenty of sulfur and polysulfides, and facilitate charge transportation and electrolyte penetration. The significantly enhanced conductivity and the unique bimodal-mesopore structure in 3DCGS result in its superior electrochemical performance. The reversible discharge capacity for sulfur is 1217 mA h g(-1); the corresponding capacity for the whole electrode (including the 3DCGS, the conductive additive and the binder) is 877.4 mA h g(e)(-1), which is the highest ever reported. In addition, the capacity decay is as low as 0.08% per cycle, and the high-rate capacity up to 4C is as large as 653.4 mA h g(-1).

In a rechargeable Li-S battery-a strong contender to outperform the Li-ion technology migration of lithium polysulfides from the sulfur cathode has been linked to rapid capacity fading and lower Coulombic efficiency. However, the current approaches for configuring Li-S cells with permselective membranes suffer from large ohmic polarization, resulting in low capacity and poor rate capability. To overcome these issues, we report the facile fabrication of a high-flux graphene oxide membrane directly onto the sulfur cathode by shear alignment of discotic nematic liquid crystals of graphene oxide (GO). In conjunction with a carbon-coated separator, the highly ordered structure of the thin (similar to 0.75 mu m) membrane and its inherent surface charge retain a majority of the polysulfides, enabling the cells to deliver very high initial discharge capacities of 1063 and 1182 mAh g(electrode)(-1) for electrodes with 70 and 80% sulfur content, respectively, at the practical 0.5 C rate. The very high sulfur utilization and impressive capacity retentions of the high sulfur content electrodes result in some of the highest performance metrics in the literature of Li-S (e.g., electrode capacity of 835 mAh gelectrode after 100 cycles at 0.5 C with a sulfur content of 80%). We show that the structural order of the shear-aligned GO membrane is key in maintaining good kinetics of the charge transfer processes in Li-S batteries.

However, the well-known 'shuttle effect' of polysulfides, that has significant impact on battery performance, has impeded the commercialization of Li-S batteries with high volumetric energy density and cycle life necessary for economic viability. Herein, we provide a facile method for the fabrication of hierarchical porous carbon with optimal pore structure to support sulfur in the cathode. The specific surface area of the coal-derived hierarchical porous carbon can be as high as 3343 m(2)/g, with a high distribution of pores between 2 and 5 nm, which is both beneficial to confining the polysulfides and increased sulfur loading (as high as 76wt%). With most of sulfur confined in small mesopores, the carbon/sulfur composites show a high specific capacity of 1390 mAh/g at 0.05 C with similar to 85% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.5 C.

To overcome these issues, herein, we present MoP quantum dots anchored N, P-doped graphene (MPQ@G) as a multifunctional LSB cathode. The N, P-doped graphene layers serve as a conductive skeleton to support the MoP QDs which can accelerate the electron transfer, physically hinder the polysulfide migration and thus enhance the electrochemical performance. More importantly, as a polar and conductive catalyst, MoP QDs provide catalytically active sites for the conversion of LiPSs. As a result, the LSBs with MPQ@G/S cathodes deliver an elevated initial capacity of 1220.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and remain 98.9% after rate cycles, signifying its exceptional cycling stability. Moreover, it displays a large capacity of 681.2 mAh g(-1) even at a high rate of 1 C. The Li-S pouch cell also presents high specific capacities and preeminent cycling stabilities, confirming its great potential for high-rate applications. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the improved absorptivity and redox conversion reversibility of LiPSs. This work provides an efficient strategy to improve composite with highly adsorptive and catalytic properties for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, realizing such a sulfur cathode with high sulfur loading and high capacity utilization is very challenging due to the insulating nature of sulfur. In this work, a strategy is proposed for fabricating solid phase conversion sulfur cathode by encapsulating sulfur in the mesoporous channels of CMK-3 carbon to form a coaxially assembled sulfur/carbon (CA-S/C) composite. Vinyl carbonate (VC) is simultaneously utilized as the electrolyte cosolvent to in-situ form a dense solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the CA-S/C composite surface through its nucleophilic reaction with the freshly generated polysulfides at the beginning of initial discharge, thus separating the direct contact of interior sulfur with the outer electrolyte. As expected, such a CA-S/C cathode can operate in a solid phase conversion manner in the VC-ether cosolvent electrolyte to exhibit a full capacity utilization (1667 mA h g(-1), approximate to 100%), a high rate capability of 2.0 A g(-1) and excellent long-term cyclability over 500 cycles even at a high sulfur loading (75%, based on the weight of CA-S/C composite), demonstrating great promise for constructing high-energy-density and cycle-stable Li-S batteries.

In this work, the first parametric study of the capillary drawing-in dissolved materials in low surface tension solvents accompanying ultrasonic method is reported which has low heat consumption and convenient process. The optimized parameters are composite concentration (ratio of total composite material to solvent), ultrasonic irradiation power, ultrasonic irradiation time and initial sulfur concentration on the filling yield. A complete characterization were executed to investigate various characteristics of synthesized S@CNT composites. The results indicate that the elemental sulfur were successfully physically (no chemical bond) confined inside of the carbon nanotubes. The maximum amount of sulfur that confined inside the cavity of carbon nanotubes is 36.21 %wt. This synthesized composite as cathodic material for Li-S battery offers a stable cycling profile (81.68% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 2C) and sufficient capacity (725 mAh g(-1) at 2C) at high C-rate. These results indicate that carbon nanotubes provide a high electronic conductivity shell with a cavity that balances the volume expansion of the sulfur during charge and discharge of cycles in Li-S batteries and also supplies an excellent trap for the polysulfides, prevents the dissolution of them, and controls the shuttle effect. These excellent results are believed to contribute to improvements in this technology.

However, the intrinsic mobile redox centers during the sulfur/Li2S-to-lithium polysulfides solid-to-liquid phase transition induce low sulfur utilization and poor cycling life. Herein, the Janus separator of mesoporous cellular graphene framework (CGF)/polypropylene membrane to promote the utilization of sulfur cathode is introduced. The porous polypropylene membrane serves as an insulating substrate in contact with lithium anode while CGFs that possess high electrical conductivity of 100 S cm(-1), a large mesopore volume of 3.1 cm(3) g(-1), and a huge surface area of 2120 m(2) g(-1) are adhered on cathode side to reactivate the shuttling-back polysulfides and to preserve the ion channels. Therefore, the Li-S cell with the "two-face" CGF Janus separator exhibit a high initial capacity of 1109 mAh g(-1) and superior capacity preserved upon 800 mAh g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.2 C, which is 40% higher on sulfur utilization efficiency than the corresponding results with routine polypropylene separators. There are significant improvements on capacity as well as electrochemical kinetics. A very high areal capacity of 5.5 mAh cm(-2) combined with high sulfur content of 80% and areal loading amount of 5.3 mg cm(-2) is achieved for such advanced configuration. The negative impact of shuttle mechanism on lowering the utilization of sulfur and overall energy density of a Li-S battery is well eliminated by applying CGF separators. Consequently, employing carbonaceous materials as Janus face of separators enlightens new opportunities for improving the utilization of active materials and energy density of devices that involve complex phase evolution and conversion electrochemistry.

To solve this problem effectively, a covalent organic framework (COF), Azo-COF, with a regular pore distribution of 2.6 nm was prepared as the host for sulfur. Such small mesopores can not only confine the sulfur well in the nanopores but also supply Li+ with one-dimension (1D) transmission channels. Benefiting from this concept, even without a LiNO3 additive, the Li-S battery assembly with a S/Azo-COF cathode presented a high stable capacity of 741 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles while delivering a high initial discharge capacity of nearly 1536 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C (1C = 1672 mA g(-1)). Additionally, when the capacity rate (C-rate) was increased to 2C, a high discharge capacity of 770 mA h g(-1) can be still achieved after 20 cycles, proving excellent C-rate performance.

Therefore, the performance degradation of high-sulfur-loading cathodes becomes an urgent problem to be solved at present. In addition, the volumetric capacities of high-sulfur-loading cathodes are still at a low level compared with their areal capacities. Aiming at these issues, two-dimensional carbon yolk-shell nanosheet is developed herein to construct a novel self-supporting sulfur cathode. The cathode with high-sulfur loading of 5mg cm(-2) and sulfur content of 73 wt% not only delivers an excellent rate performance and cycling stability, but also provides a favorable balance between the areal (5.7 mAh cm(-2)) and volumetric (1330 mAh cm(-3)) capacities. Remarkably, an areal capacity of 11.4 mAh cm(-2) can be further achieved by increasing the sulfur loading from 5 to 10mg cm(-2). This work provides a promising direction for high-energy-density lithium-sulfur batteries.

The rGO skin and ALD-oxide coating worked as natural and artificial barriers to constrain the polysulfides within the cathode region. As a result, the Li-S battery based on this electrode material exhibited superior cycling stability, good rate capability and high coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, ALD-ZnO coating was tested for performance improvement and found to be more effective than ALD-MgO coating. The ZnO modified G-S electrode with 55 wt% sulfur loading delivered a maximum discharge capacity of 998 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 C. A high capacity of 846 mA h g(-1) was achieved after charging/discharging for 100 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of over 92%. In the case of using LiNO3 as a shuttle inhibitor, this electrode showed an initial discharge capacity of 796 mA h g(-1) and a capacity retention of 81% after 250 cycles at a current density of 1 C with an average coulombic efficiency higher than 99.7%.

Herein, we design and synthesize freestanding graphitized carbon interlayers decorated with Fe/Fe3C nanocatalysts by thermal treatment of cellulose paper with adsorbed ferric nitrate at 1000 degrees C, during which the freestanding carbon network derives from the cellulose paper while the Fe results from the reduction of Fe3+ with a carbothermal reduction process; simultaneously, the in situ formed Fe boosts graphitization of carbon to enhance electrical conductivity of the interlayer, and the carbon network effectively helps confine and accommodate Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles. Therefore, the well dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles catalytically accelerate electrochemical conversion of polysulfides, while the enhanced conductive network of carbon benefits the electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process. The cell with an optimal carbon/Fe/Fe3C interlayer delivers excellent cyclability and rate performances. At current densities of 0.2C and 2C, the specific capacities are close to 1000 and 735mA h g(-1), respectively. Even after 200 cycles at 1C, the reversible specific capacity is still 772mA h g(-1). Such a synergistic catalytic interlayer with an enhanced conversion kinetic towards polysulfides provides a new approach for improving electrochemical performances of LSBs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A carbon-paper interlayer, referred to as dual functional porous carbon wall (DF-PCW), has been obtained by filling the voids in TiO2 spheres with carbon and then etching the TiO2 template with a chemical process. The DF-PCW interlayer provides a medium for scavenging the lithium polysulfides and suppressing them from diffusing to the anode side when it is inserted between the sulfur cathode and the separator. Lithium-sulfur cells fabricated with the thus prepared S-HMT@CNT cathode and the DF-PCW interlayer exhibit superior performance due to the containment of sulfur in TiO2 and improved lithium-ion and electron transports. The Li-S cells display high capacity with excellent capacity retention at rates as high as 1C, 2C, and 5C rates.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is still hindered by poor cycle stability and rate capability caused by the low electronic conductivity of sulfur and dissolution of intermediate polysulfides. Here, we employ easily-obtained titanium nitride (TiN) as a highly efficient immobilizer to trap polysulfides via a chemical mechanism. TiN also possesses high electronic conductivity which helps in achieving a high sulfur utility and an excellent rate capability. At 0.5C, the TiN-based sulfur composite cathode demonstrates a high initial reversible capacity of 1012 mA h g(-1) and a long cycle life of over 200 cycles with a decay rate of 0.2% per cycle. Even at 5C, the reversible discharge capacity is still higher than 550 mA h g(-1). The outstanding electrochemical performance is ascribed to the strong chemisorption effect between TiN and polysulfides.

Herein we present our first-principles calculation on borophene as host of cathode in Li-S battery. The adsorption energies of sulfur cluster (S-8) and its discharge products (Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4, Li2S2, and LiW2S) on borophene are calculated. Our results indicate that borophene host can trap lithium polysulfides stably and effectively, which could avoid shuttle effect and improve the utilization of active material. The band structure of the adsorption structures shows that the borophene sulfur cluster is metallic, while partial charge density proves that the conductivity is mainly due to the metallic borophene substrate. Such favorable electrical conductivity is helpful to the cathode charge/discharge processes. Therefore, borophene could be a promising host for S cathode due to its strong adsorption, high conductivity, and small deformation.

Hydrothermal nanocasting: Synthesis of hierarchically porous carbon monoliths and their application in lithium-sulfur batteries	CARBON			English	Article							MESOPOROUS CARBON; NEGATIVE ELECTRODES; NANOPARTICLES; CARBONIZATION; STRATEGY; POROSITY; FOAMS; SUPERCAPACITORS; REPLICATION; PERFORMANCE	This manuscript reports a hydrothermal nanocasting method using hierarchically meso-macroporous silica monolith templates to synthesize hierarchically porous carbon monoliths. Abundant and cheap carbohydrates (i.e. sucrose, glucose and xylose) can be used as precursors for the synthesis of such monolithic carbons. The development of porosity at different post-calcination temperatures is investigated. Upon removal of the silica template after hydrothermal carbonization only (180 degrees C, 10 bars), the polymer-like furan-rich structure is too "soft", blocking the mesopores and exhibiting a low porosity. Increasing the post-treatment temperature up to 950 degrees C increases both BET surface area and pore volume up to 1426 m(2) g(-1) and 3.097 cm(3) g(-1), respectively. Further thermal treatment induces also a loss of surface functional groups and an increase in the conductivity, while preserving the initial monolithic aspect. Such a versatile control over porosity at different length scales, functionality and conductivity offers the opportunity to adapt the synthetic parameters to the aimed application. Herein, we used our highly porous monolithic carbons as sulfur hosts for lithium-sulfur batteries. With this aim, we infiltrated a large amount of sulfur within the carbonaceous scaffolds reaching an initial discharge capacity of 1305 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 167.5 mA g(-1).

In this account, carbon nanotubes/SiC (CNTs/SiC) composites were prepared by means of catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD). SiC was used as the matrix for growth of CNTs and ferrocene served as catalyst. The surface of SiC was successfully loaded with carbon nanotubes, which underwent increasing growth to form clusters. Sulfur was added into CNTs/SiC by the hydrothermal method to yield sulfur-carbon nanotubes/SiC composites (S-CNTs/SiC) for Li-S batteries. SiC was strongly bound to lithium polysulfides (LPS) through chemical interactions and CNTs attracted LPS by physical absorption. CNTs provided good electrical conductivity for the overall composite and SiC enhanced adsorption ability of LPS. DFT calculation was carried out to illustrate direct Si-S interaction and strong confinement on LPS of SiC. Both factors synergistically reduced loss in active substances during battery cycling. The resulting S-CNTs/SiC electrodes displayed discharge capacity of 685mAhg(-1) at 0.1C after 100cycles, coupled with excellent cycle performance of 316mAhg(-1) after 400cycles at 1C.

However, the intrinsical insulation and dramatic volume change of sulfur, as well as serious shuttle effect of polysulfides hinder their practical implementation. Herein, we develop three-dimensional micron flowers assembled by nitrogen doped carbon (NC) nanosheets with sulfur encapsulated (S@NC-NSs) as a promising cathode for Li-S to overcome the forementioned obstacles. The in situ generated S layer adheres to the inner surface of the hollow and micro-porous NC shell with fruitful O/N containing groups endowing both efficient physical trapping and chemical anchoring of polysulfides. Meanwhile, such a novel carbon shell helps to bear dramatic volume change and provides a fast way for electron transfer during cycling. Consequently, the S@NC-NSs demonstrate a high capacity (1,238 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C; 1.0 C = 1,675 mA g(-1)), superior rate performance with a capacity retention of 57.8% when the current density increases 25 times from 0.2 to 5.0 C, as well as outstanding cycling performance with an ultralow capacity fading of only 0.064% after 200 cycles at a high current density of 5.0 C.

Herein, a nanostructured VS4 anchored on defect-rich carbon nanofibers (CNF-VS4) was coated on the commercial separator as both physical blocks to mitigate the shuttle effects and as an electrocatalyst to enhance the reaction kinetics of polysulfides/Li2S. Besides, polar nanostructured VS4 shows a high affinity to polysulfides, and conductive CNF network serves as "second collector" to trap and reutilize the active materials. The functional coating layer also provides rich defects for the dispersion and stabilization of Li2S. When the CNF-VS4 functional separator based on a high-sulfur content (80 wt%) cathode was applied in Li-S batteries, a high initial capacity of 1135 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and a superior rate capacity of 780 mA h g(-1) at 2C were achieved. Even under a higher rate (5C), it still delivered a stable capacity of 300 mA h g(-1) over 1000 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of 95%.

J	Shih, HJ; Chang, JY; Cho, CS; Li, CC				Shih, Hsuan-Ju; Chang, Jin-Yu; Cho, Chuan-Sheng; Li, Chia-Chen			Nano-carbon-fiber-penetrated sulfur crystals as potential cathode active material for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries	CARBON			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; HIGH-CAPACITY; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; COMPOSITES; SEPARATOR; PROGRESS; ION; CNT	A novel composite consisting of vapor-grown carbon fibers penetrating sulfur crystals is developed. Using this new composite as the cathode active material greatly improves the ionic and electronic conductivity of fabricated lithium-sulfur batteries and helps to suppress the polarization of S intermediates during the charging and discharging processes. Importantly, the special structure of the composite also offers the potential of freely achieving high areal mass loading and capacity via the cost-efficient tape-casting method. The constructed battery exhibits a highly stable capacity of 920 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C with good retention of 90% after 200 charge-discharge cycles and a good coulombic efficiency of 100%. Furthermore, good areal capacities of 3.4-4.4 mAh cm(-2) with retention of 93-97% through cycles under 0.2-0.5C are achieved. These good performances are attributed to the greatly improved conductivity of the sulfur electrode, better utilization of sulfur, and the lower dissolution and shuttle effect of the polysulfides in the cell.

At the same time, the 3D electrode material exhibits superiority in the field of battery energy storage. Herein, a 3D binderless N/S codoped electrode is obtained by simply carbonization and acid treatment of a carbon cloth electrode coated with a hydroxide/thiourea/starch aqueous solution thermogel. The carbon cloth@nitrogen and sulfur codoped porous carbon (CC@NS) aims at carbon-bearing sulfur in its surface porous carbon structure. As a result, the CC@NS/S electrode achieves a high initial specific capacity of 1249.9 mAh g(-1)at 0.5 C and still has a residual capacity of 752.2 mAh g(-1)after 350 cycles. The N, O, and S dopants provide abundant electrocatalytic active sites in the chemical bonding of polysulfides and their accelerated redox kinetics to improve utilization of active materials. Herein, the way for the versatile sulfur-based design of advanced lithium-ion batteries is paved.

On the basis of the density functional theory calculations on the bonds between g-C3N4 and lithium polysulfides including Li2S4, Li2S6 and Li2S8, it is found the cathode possesses robust binding energies towards polysulfides and an improved conductivity, which would enable a strong suppression for the transfer of the lithium polysulfides. The prepared porous binder-free cathode exhibits a high capacity of 892 mAh g(-1) after cycling 250 times at 0.2 C and a well-recoverable rate-performance, which indicates a good potential to construct high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries for practical applications.

Herein, nickel hydroxide@graphene (Ni(OH)(2)@GR) is synthesized as a sulfur carrier by a simple refluxing method to efficiently confine sulfur for highly stable LSBs. The two-dimensional (2D) vertical arrays of Ni(OH)(2) with extensive hydrophilic hydroxyl groups endow the cathode with powerful restriction and strong chemisorption ability of polysulfides. Besides, the typical 2D GR sheets provide a stable barrier for polysulfides and further accelerate the electron/ion migration transmission. Based on the Ni(OH)(2)@GR sheet-to-sheet heterostructure, the electrodes achieve 72% sulfur loading and exhibit outstanding long-term cycling stability with a decay rate of only 0.002% per cycle at 1C for 500 cycles.

Herein, we synthesized uniform pomegranate-like microclusters (MCs) via carbonization of a Prussian blue analogue; the MCs consist of homogeneously inlaid ultrafine Co nanoparticles in nitrogen-doped carbon subunits (Co-NPC). The hierarchical pore structure and high conductivity of the Co-NPC-MCs can immobilize sulfur species, and the ultrafine Co nanoparticles and doped nitrogen exert catalytic effects to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. Therefore, the S/Co-NPC-MCs cathode exhibits a high initial capacity of 1192 mA h g(-1) and 941 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5C. It also exhibits excellent rate capacities at high rates of 1C and 2C; the reversible capacities remain at 650 mA h g(-1) and 574 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles, respectively, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications.

However, practical applications are still limited by rapid capacity decay caused by multielectron redox reactions and complex phase transformations. Here, we include commercially available titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) in carbon/sulfur cathodes, to introduce strong chemical interactions between the lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and TS-1 in a working Li-S battery. In situ UV-visible spectroscopy together with other experimental results confirm that incorporation of TS-1 mediators enables direct conversion between S-8(2-) and S-3*(-) radicals during the discharge process, which effectively promotes the kinetic behaviors of soluble LiPS and regulates uniform nucleation and growth of solid sulfide precipitates. These features give our TS-1 engineered sulfur cathode an ultrahigh initial capacity of 1459 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C. Moreover, the system has an impressively high areal capacity (3.84 mA h cm(-2)) and long cycling stability with a high sulfur loading of 4.9 mg cm(-2). This novel and low-cost fabrication procedure is readily scalable and provides a promising avenue for potential industrial applications.

However, it remains challenging to clarify the electrochemical reduction pathways under the action of the catalyst. Here, the nickel phosphide nanosphere with reduced graphene oxide (Ni2P/rGO) as a bifunctional catalyst is proposed to anchor and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides. With a robust porous structure, the high specific surface area as well as the preponderant electrical conductivity, Ni2P/rGO can increase the active sites significantly and accelerate effectively the electron/ion transport, indicative of the accelerated conversion kinetics of polysulfides. Besides, Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra at different discharge depths were used to analyze the sulfur reduction pathways under different catalysts, suggesting that Ni2P/rGO effectively enhances the kinetics of reduction reaction and reduces the energy barrier of the end products (Li2S) nucleation. Given these, upon a high sulfur loading of 5.3 mg cm(-2), the Ni2P/rGO based electrode delivers a high area capacity of 4.067 mAh cm(-2) at 0.2 C with excellent stability.

There is extensive research focused on cathode materials. However, relatively little attention has been gained on a binder in enhancing battery performance. The binding agent is a primary component in the cathode and plays an important role in solving the sulfur volume expansion problem during the reaction. In this work, Al (III)-carboxylate metal-organic aerogels (Al-MOGs) are reported for the first time as a binder, which can anchor the diffusion of hydrophilic polysulfides in the cathode and restrain a self-discharge reaction from proceeding for the Li-S battery. In the charge-discharge system, the admirable electrochemical performance of the as-fabricated combination cathode is proven through a satisfactory initial discharge capacity and good rate performance (1391 mAh g(-1) at 0.3 C and 664 mAh g(-1) at 6.0 C) and a notable cyclability (902 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.3 C). Accordingly, the creation of Al-MOG gives an updated perception for high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

The obtained sulfur cathode demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity (1321 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), excellent rate capability (1030 and 753 mAh g(-1) at 1 and 3 C, respectively), and superior cycling stability (611 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 3 C). The enhancement in electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the unique core@shell architecture: the interconnected CNT-assembled dodecahedra core provides rapid Li+/e(-) transport and sufficient free space for volume change; the Ni (OH)(2) nanosheet shell not only acts as a durable physical barrier, but also serves as the polar material to restrain the dissolution of polysulfides with chemical interaction. In addition, in-situ nitrogen doping in CNTs introduces rich defects and active sites for polysulfides adsorption. This work provides a promising direction for high performance Li-S batteries by coating strong polar material on carbon materials.

The TiO2 NTs/RGO film not only localizes the migrating polysulfides by the common effects of chemical binding and physical adsorption but also enhances the lithium-ion migration by reducing the electrochemical resistance. The excellent chemical and physical adsorption ability were proved by the measurement of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and adsorption experiments.

Even the most-used battery on the planet, the lithium-ion battery, is reaching its technological limit. In light of this, lithium-sulfur batteries have emerged as one of the most promising technologies to address this problem. The use of biomass to produce cathodes for these batteries addresses not only the aforementioned problem, but it also reduces the carbon footprint and gives added value to something normally considered waste. Here, the production, by simple and nonactivating pyrolysis, of a carbon material using the abundant "after-boiling waste" derived from beer brewing is reported. After adding a high sulfur loading (70 %) to this biowaste-derived carbon by the "melt diffusion" method, the sulfur-carbon composite is used as an effective cathode in Li-S batteries. The cathode shows excellent performance, reaching high capacity values with long-term cyclability at high current-847 mAh g(-1)at 1 C, 586 mAh g(-1)at 2 C, and even 498 mAh g(-1)at 5 C after 400 cycles-drastically reducing capacity loss to values approaching 0.01 % per cycle. This work demonstrates the possibility of obtaining low-cost, highly sustainable cathodic materials for the design of advanced energy storage systems.

Here, an amorphous FeOOH (A-FeOOH) with nanosheet architecture is obtained by a mild oxidation transformation process at room temperature, which is constructed as a practical catalyst to facilitate the conversion of LiPSs. A systematic structure analysises and calculation simulations reveal that the enhanced surface electron transfer dynamics of the as-formed A-FeOOH is modulated by a loss of oxygen coordination, and retention ligand oxygens are also found to be activated as co-catalysts to boost SRR process. Unsaturated Fe-O bondings tuning of catalysts via shifting of d band centers, leading to an elevated interaction between Fe 3d orbitals and S 2p orbitals, which much more effectively accelerate the breaking of S-S bonds in LiPSs. Meanwhile, enhanced electrical conductivity originated from oxygen vacancies accelerates electron repopulation, thereby promoting the smooth conversion reaction of sulfur. Additionally, A-FeOOH acts as non-carbon-based catalysts, which alleviates short circuits while reducing non-catalytic domains. The amorphous nanosheets are also uniformly and spontaneously coating on the surface of cathodes, inhibiting the shuttle effect and buffering volumetric expansion. A-FeOOH based Li-S cathode (AFeOOH@SCM) exhibits a reversible capacity of 723 mAh.g(-1) over 250 cycles at 1C and delivers a high energy density of 363 wh.kg(-1) at 0.2C on multilayer-pouch cell level under lean electrolyte of 3.2 g.g(Sulfur)(-1)and high loading of 9.36 mg.cm(-2).

Challenging conventional wisdom, we found that pi-stacked PBI assemblies were stable even in their reduced state through secondary interactions between PBI nanofibers and Li2Sn, which resulted in a redoxactive, flowable 3-D gel network. The influence of supramolecular charge-transporting PBI-PS gel networks on Li-S battery performance was investigated in depth and revealed enhanced sulfur utilization and rate performance (C/4 and C/8) at a sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2) and energy density of 44 Wh L-1 in the absence of conductive carbon additives.

But the commercialization processes of Li-S/Se batteries are slow due to the poor conductivity of elemental S/Se and insoluble low-order lithium polysulfides (polyselenides), severe "shuttle effect" of soluble high-order lithium polysulfides (polyselenides) and slow reaction kinetics during the process of redox reaction. Nowadays, the rationally designed two dimensional (2D) materials in the compositions of Li-S/Se batteries have presented conspicuous merits and can greatly enhance the electrochemical performances of the batteries. This review firstly highlights the distinctive structural merits of various 2D materials for advanced Li-S/Se cells. Then an overview of recent advances in the designs and preparations of different 2D materials with well-designed shapes, tailored structures, selective chemical constituents and their corresponding electrochemical properties combining the physical confinement, chemical adsorption, catalytic effect et al. Finally, some challenges and viewpoints in this field are also discussed. The comprehensive review will help researchers to well learn rational designs including modification based on structure and engineering of 2D materials for effectively enhancing electrochemical performances of Li-S/Se cells, which eventually lead the batteries to be a practically commercial applications for power source.

However, moderating the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and enhancing the conductivity of the sulfur cathode are the main limitations for its successful application. Herein, we demonstrate an approach to simultaneously tackle these two barriers by designing a porous N-Co3O4@N-C nanododecahedral composite. This composite was derived from ZIF-67 via a facile pyrolysis method, which realizes the effective doping of nitrogen into both Co3O4 and the carbon framework, simultaneously achieving a well-defined porous structure. After wrapping with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), this porous N-Co3O4@N-C/rGO cathode supported a high sulfur loading (5.89 mg cm(-2)) and exhibited excellent stability (611 mA h g(-1) at 2C after 1000 cycles). Furthermore, ex situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculations confirm that the N-Co3O4@N-C/rGO nanododecahedra effectively bind LiPSs in the electrode over multiple cycles. This proved that the cobalt oxides in the porous N-Co3O4@N-C nanododecahedra have strong affinity for binding LiPSs. The simultaneous doping of nitrogen both into the cobalt oxides and carbon framework not only strengthened the binding energy for LiPSs absorption, but also improved the overall conductivity of the nanododecahedra. Moreover, the interconnected porous structure contributes to the electron transfer and alleviates the volume changes of active materials during cycling.

The current carbon based cathodes suffer from poor cycle stability and high cost. Recently, heteroatom doped carbons have been considered as a settlement to enhance the performance of lithium sulfur batteries. With this strategy, we report the low cost activated nori based N,O-doped 3D hierarchical carbon material (ANC) as a sulfur host, The N,O dual-doped ANC reveals an elevated electrochemical performance, which exhibits, not only a good rate performance over 5 C, but also a high sulfur content of 81.2%. Further importantly, the ANC represents an excellent cycling stability, the cathode reserves a capacity of 618 rnAh/g at 2 C after 1000 cycles, which shows a 0.022% capacity decay per cycle.

The practical application of LSBs has long been blocked by the serious lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle effect and notorious Li dendrite growth, inducing fast capacity decay and limited cycling lifespan. Herein, fluorinated carbon prepared via a safe and scalable strategy has rationally been coated on a separator affording bifunctional fluorinated Celgard (F-Celgard) for LSB construction. The F-Celgard shows superior Li+ flux modulation and LiPS trapping capability, which has been verified by the density function theory calculations. The Li symmetric cells demonstrate long and stable Li plating/stripping with much smaller polarization voltage and dendrite-free Li deposition. In addition, LSBs show superior rate performances with higher discharge capacities and long-time stable cycling over 1000 cycles at 1 C with a low decay rate of similar to 0.038% per cycle. With a high sulfur loading (similar to 5.2 mg cm(-2)), a high initial areal capacity of similar to 4.2 mAh cm(-2) can be obtained with a superior capacity retention of similar to 91.8% at 0.2 C. This work demonstrates a facile, cost-effective, and scalable strategy toward highly stable LSBs for practical usage.

Therefore, the kinetically fast catalytic conversion of polysulfide intermediates is especially important for the full utilization of sulfur. Herein, Co9S8-x/N-doped graphene (Co9S8-x/N-G) is used as a sulfur host material and electrocatalyst in a high-sulfur-loading cathode, in which sulfur vacancies are generated via the hydrogen reduction of stoichiometric Co9S8. The produced sulfur vacancies in Co9S8-x/N-G effectively improve the adsorption ability for polysulfide anions, and theoretical calculations indicate that Co9S8-x has lower adsorption energy for polysulfides than Co9S8. Furthermore, electrochemical experiments reveal that the electrode process kinetics for the catalytic conversion of polysulfides are enhanced by sulfur vacancies. As a result, the S/Co9S8-x/N-G cathode with a high sulfur loading of 14.6 mg cm(-2) delivers a high areal capacity of 12.9 mA h cm(-2), and long-term cycling stability with a slow decay rate of 0.035% per cycle during 1000 cycles at 1C. Additionally, the pouch cell shows foldable flexibility and a stable areal capacity of 5.9 mA h cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of 7.1 mg cm(-2). The results show that enhancing the polysulfide conversion process kinetics using sulfur vacancies could be an effective approach for obtaining high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, a mesoporous carbon-supported cobalt-nickel bimetal composite (CoNi@MPC) is synthesized and directly coated on the original separator to serve as a secondary collector for lithium-sulfur batteries. CoNi@MPC exhibits multiple Co-Ni active sites, able to catalyze the reactions of soluble polysulfides, specifically accelerating the generation and decomposition of insoluble Li2S in lithiation and delithiation process testified by the electrochemical results and density functional theory calculation. Relying on the bifunctionality of CoNi@MPC composite, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides can be effectively alleviated. Moreover, porous carbon as the conductive scaffold favors the improvement of electronic conductivity.

However, severe self-discharge due to the dissolution and shuttle effect of polysulfides hinders the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this work, we present a strategy to entrap sulfur in a mesoporous FePO4/carbon nanocomposite that relies on a chemical process, in which FePO4 bonds with sulfur to form S-O chemical bonds for high performance Li-S batteries. The prepared S/FePO4/C nanocomposite exhibits excellent cycling performance. It delivers an initial discharge capacity of 953.8 mA h g(-1) and a discharge capacity of 550.8 mA h g(-1) can be reserved after successive cycling for 500 cycles with a capacity decay rate of 0.05% per cycle at 0.5C. Also, the S/FePO4/C electrode exhibits extremely low self-discharge behavior. The cell voltage is stabilized at a high value of approximately 2.9 V after 7 days' rest with S/FePO4/C as the cathode. Even after 30 days' rest, the potential is still maintained at about 2.7 V, demonstrating an extremely low rate of self-discharge. In addition, both the areal capacity and the volumetric capacity of the S/FePO4/C electrode are superior to those of the S/carbon electrode, indicating its promising application in practical Li-S batteries.

The electrically insulating property of sulfur and lithium sulfide and the solubility of polysulfides in the electrolyte, however, pose great challenges for the realization of long-lasting lithium-sulfur batteries for commercial applications. In recent years, much attention has been focused on mesoporous carbon-sulfur composites as cathode material. Fundamental studies on the performance of such electrodes correlated to systematic variations of structural and porosity characteristics of the carbons remain elusive, however. In this work a variety of block copolymer (BCP) derived mesoporous carbons were studied with unifont and tunable pore sizes as sulfur hosts. Morphologies included hexagonally packed cylinders and co-continuous gyroids, with one- and three-dimensional porosity, respectively. Dependence of the cydability of carbon-sulfur composites was tested on mesopore size, morphology, and carbonization temperatures of up to 1600 degrees C. Results demonstrate the significant impact of the carbon properties related to the carbonization temperature, such as heteroatom content, on the capacity retention of carbon-sulfur cathodes, while morphological parameters and mesopore sizes (between 15 and 40 nm) of carbons studied here have little influence on performance. The high-temperature-derived gyroidal mesoporous carbons (1600 degrees C) exhibited remarkable structural stability toward activation. This allowed for the introduction of nanopores (<4 nm) with a large pore volume of 0.8 cm(3) g(-1) in addition to the BCP-derived mesopores (15-40 nm), with total pore volumes over 2 cm(3) g(-1), surface areas over 2000 m(2) g, and retention of the well-ordered gyroidal morphology. Highly activated, gyroidal carbon-sulfur composites showed good cyclability and rate capability with discharge capacities after 100 cydes of 831 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and 730 mAh g(-1) at 1 C.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur/lithium sulfides and the severe polysulfide shuttle reaction between the Li anode and sulfur cathode can hinder their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate the rational design and construction of CdS quantum dots uniformly attached to carbon nanotubes for sulfur infiltration, these structures were subsequently used as a high-performance sulfur cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries. This special architecture exhibits a high polysulfide adsorption and confinement while allowing fast electron and Li ion transfer. In addition, the synergic catalytic effect of the cadmium and the introduced heteroatoms favor the enhancement of the reaction kinetics. As a result, this carbon nanotubes/CdS quantum dots/S composite greatly improves the rate and cycle performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. The specific capacity decreases slowly from 1237.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C to 918.1 mA h g(-1) at 2.0C, showing an excellent rate performance and a good capacity retention of 820.6 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C for over 150 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of over 98.0%. The inclusion of the CdS quantum dots suppresses the shuttle effect and enhances the redox kinetics, thereby leading to the high utilization of sulfur, and thus providing new avenues for the design of advanced cathode materials for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

These carbon foams, which serve as hosts for sulfur in lithium battery, can provide a conducting network and shorter diffusion length for Li-ions. Specially, the zinc nanodots derived from the carbothermal reaction of ZnCl2 at high temperature can interact with sulfur/polysulfides by strong chemisorption. In addition, the zinc nanodots can also facilitate the conversion reaction between Li2Sx (2 < x < 8) and Li2S/Li2S2. Therefore, Zn@NCFs/S cathode presents high sulfur utility and large capacity.

The porous carbon serves as a superior cathode material to anchor sulfur due to its uniform and tortuous morphology, enabling high capacity and good cycle lifetime in lithium sulfur-batteries. Under a current rate of 0.2 C, the carbon-sulfur composites with 56.7 wt% sulfur loading deliver an initial capacity of 1625 mAh g(-1), which is almost equal to the theoretical capacity of sulfur. The good performance may be ascribed to excellent electronic networks constructed by the high-surface-area carbon species. Moreover, the semi-closed architecture of derived carbons can effectively retard the polysulfides dissolution during charge/discharge, resulting in a capacity of 940 mAh g(-1) after 120 charge/discharge cycles.

Due to the increased total porosity and high surface area of 1747 m(2)g(-1) the completeness of sulfur infiltration in intra-particle pores of CB is promoted. This is found to not only minimize sulfur agglomeration on the particle surface but also reduce self-discharge, that is, polysulfide leakage. Wrapping the CB/sulfur composite with a poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(vinylpyrrolidone) film further triggers a synergy allowing for faster sulfur conversion with increased reversibility. Thus, an initial capacity of 1238 mAh g(-1) s at C/10 and a stable capacity of 1015 mAhg(-1)s after 50 cycles were obtained, combined with a superior rate capability up to 2 C (approximate to 7.5 mAcm(-2)) and extremely slow self-discharge over 100 days (open-circuit voltage >2.30 V).

One of the important ingredients to improve the safety and energy density in Li-S batteries is the solid-state electrolyte. However, the poor ionic conductivity largely limits its application for the commercial market. At present, the gel electrolyte prepared by combining the electrolyte or ionic liquid with the all-solid electrolyte is an effective method to solve the low ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte. We present a cross-linked gel polymer electrolyte with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film formed for Li-S quasi-solid-state batteries, which can be simply synthesized without initiators. This gel polymer electrolyte with FEC as an additive (GPE@FEC) possesses high ionic conductivity (0.830 x 10(-3) S/cm at 25 degrees C and 1.577 x 10(-3) S/cm at 85 degrees C) and extremely high Li-ion transference number (t(Li)(+) = 0.674). In addition, the strong ability toward anchoring polysulfides resulting in the high electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries was confirmed in GPE@FEC by the diffusion experiment, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) mapping of the S element. Such a high ion conductivity (IC) gel polymer electrolyte enables a competitive specific capacity of 940 mAh/g at 0.2C and supreme cycling performance for 180 cycles at 0.5C, which is far beyond that of conventional poly(ethylene oxide)-based quasi-solid-state Li-S batteries.

The limited intrinsic conductivity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) compels their utilization as the templates to prepare carbonaceous Li-S battery cathodes after high-temperature treatments. The facile and low-temperature fabrication methods of MOF-derived cathodes are largely unexplored. Herein, the hybrid of hollow zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) polyhedron functionalized with carbon nanotube (HZIF/CNT) cathode is fabricated via facile tannic acid (TA) etching and low-temperature treatment. The conductive HZIF/CNT structure with ordered hollow ZIF-8 morphology, rich heteroatoms functionalities, and hydrophilic surface endow strong adsorption of LiPSs, boosted LiPSs conversion kinetics, and regulated Li2S deposition. As a result, S@HZIF/CNT cathode delivers a superior initial capacity of 1371 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and excellent rate retention at 3.0C (696 mAh g(-1)). The remarkable cycling stability is evaluated for 500cycles at 0.5C with a 0.073% capacity decay per cycle. Moreover, the cathode with a high sulfur loading of 3.41 mg cm(-2) delivers an initial capacity of 696.4 mAh g(-1) at 1.0C and stable cycling performance over 200cycles. This work opens a facile and low-energy route to design advanced sulfur cathodes for high-performance Li-S batteries.

This study represents the first report on microporous carbon "shell" derived from carbonization of porous polymer to encapsulate ordered mesoporous carbon "core" functioning as sulfur immobilizers for Li-S batteries. The dual-pore carbon matrix combines the excellent confinement ability of micropores (0.5 nm) and large pore volume (1.432 cm(3) g(-1)) to improve sulfur loading capacity (71.3 wt%), thereby maintaining a capacity of 535 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles and a low fading rate of 0.30% per cycle. The merits of our exclusive core-shell architecture are established through comparative electrochemical performance analyses of individual mesoporous carbon and microporous carbon composites. Our experimental results bring out the excellent electrochemical performance of porous carbon composites, benefitting from its outstanding sulfur loading mass improving its overall capacity and its confinement capacity in the micropores alleviating polysulfide dissolution.

This is because the theoretical capacity of sulfur cathodes is least five times higher that of conventional cathodes. However, in combination with lithium, sulfur cathodes diffuse to all parts of the cell through an uncontrolled and irreversible shuttle effect. Various studies have attempted to confine sulfur in a particular structure while it is dissolved in electrolytes. Unfortunately, this approach is ineffective because of the mobility and corrosive properties of lithium polysulfide. In this study, we present nano-conductive additives with minimized interfacial energy to lithium polysulfide that controls the shuttle effect by confining the movement of the lithium polysulfide solution within the cathodes. The nano-conductive additive was synthesized to form low interfacial energy through surface modification and used in lithium-sulfur batteries to enable a capacity of approximately 600 mAh g(-1) for 1000 repeated charge/discharge cycles.

The S/SiO2/MWCNT composite with MWCNT content of 20 wt.% exhibited efficient electrochemical performance for use as a cathode in Li-S batteries, with initial discharge capacity of 926 mAh g(-1) and coulombic efficiency of 99% at 0.2 C rate. A discharge capacity of 501 mAh g(-1) was observed after 300 cycles with a decay rate of 0.15% per cycle. The average capacity retention was found to be 81.7% and 54.1% after 100 cycles and 300 cycles, respectively. These results demonstrate that a high content of MWCNT improved the electronic conductivity while the SiO2/MWCNT matrix represents a strong physical and chemical host for the polysulfides and active material. This study determines the combined effect of silica and MWCNT to improve the performance of the sulfur cathode.

Herein, a chessboard like electrode is proposed to tackle these problems, where MXene nanosheets function as "chessboards" to provide a conductive skeleton for the rapid conversion of polysulfides to Li2S and the sulfur-loaded mesoporous carbon nanospheres (S@MCSSiO2) work as "chesspieces" to carry polysulfides through physical confinement and chemical adsorption. A uniform Li2S precipitation with a high capacity and a series of highly reversible solid-liquid/liquid-solid phase reactions are demonstrated by experimental results. Under this regard, the proposed S@MCS-SiO2/MXene electrode displays excellent electrochemical performance, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 1303.6 mA h g-1 at 0.1C and a small attenuation rate per cycle of 0.046% in 1000 cycles at 1C.

The main challenges associated with high-sulfur-loading electrodes are low specific capacity caused by the insulating nature of sulfur and poor stability arising from dissolution of polysulfides into most organic electrolytes. Here, we propose a hierarchically structured sulfur cathode that simultaneously tackles both problems associated with high-sulfur-loading electrodes. Specifically, titanium monoxide hollow nanospheres are packed space efficiently and closely connected by carbon layers into microsized "clusters'' as the sulfur host. As a result of this hierarchical structure design, the nanoscale reaction chambers and the microscale conductive networks cooperatively promise high capacities of sulfur at various current densities. During cycling, the titaniummonoxide polar layer in every nanocompartment effectively hinders the dissolution of polysulfides, resulting in superior cycling stability for the high-sulfur-loading electrode.

Herein, we implanted NiCoP nanoparticles into the N,S co-doped porous carbon derived from petroleum coke (PCPC) to fabricate the sulfur-host of PCPC/NiCoP composites. The high specific surface area of PCPC provides abundant adsorption sites for capturing LiPSs and the NiCoP nanoparticles to improve the polarity and boost the LiPSs conversion kinetics of PCPC. The Li-S cells fabricated with PCPC/NiCoP as sulfur-host deliver high discharge capacity of 1,462.7 mAh.g(-1) lunder the current density of 0.1 C and exhibit ultralong lifespan over 800 cycles under the current density of 1, 2, and even 5 C. Additionally, the prepared composites cathodes deliver an outstanding discharge capacity of 932.5 and 826.4 mAh.g(-1) at 0.5 and 1 C with a high sulfur loading of over 3.90 mg.cm(-2), and remain stable about 60 cycles. Furthermore, the promoted adsorption-conversion process of polysulfides by introducing NiCoP nanoparticles into PCPC was investigated by experimental and theoretical calculation studies. This work offers a new light for tacking the obstacles of porous carbon-based sulfur-host and propelling the development of petroleum coke-based porous carbon for high performance Li-S batteries.

It is a consensus that improving the conductivity of sulfur cathodes and impeding the dissolution of lithium polysulfides are two key accesses to high-performance LSBs. Herein we report a sulfur/carbon black (S/C) cathode modified by self-polymerized polydopamine (pDA) with the assistance of polymerization treatment. The pDA acts as a novel and effective shell on the S/C cathode to stop the shuttle effect of polysulfides. By the synergistic effect of enhanced conductivity and multiple blocking effect for polysulfides, the S/C@pDA electrode exhibits improved electrochemical performances including large specific capacity (1135 mAhg(-1) at 0.2 C), high rate capability (533 mAhg(-1) at 5 C) and long cyclic life (965 mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles). Our smart design strategy may promote the development of high-performance LSBs.

However, there were some main challenges stemming from the polysulphide dissolution and the high flammability of the sulfur which limited the further application of the lithium sulfur Li-S batteries. Here, we reported a facile method to prepare the quasi solid-state Li-S batteries (LSBs) with sulfur nanoparticles electrode and PVDF-based solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), which had less flammability, electrochemical stability and ionic conductivity. The prepared PVDF-based solid polymer electrolyte possessed the conductivity similar to 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C and the lithium ions transference number of 0.49. GITT demonstrated the Li+ transport diffusion mechanism in the active S@nano-TiO2 cathode of the quasi solidstate lithium-sulfur battery. It was important to get the smooth diffusion path for the lower resistance in the charging process. Because of the high content and the sulfur uniform distribution on the nanoscale titanium dioxide (TiO2), the S@nano-TiO2 cathode exhibited its performance. The first cycle discahrge specific capacity was 1160 mAh g(-1) at 0.15C at room temperature.

Revealing reaction mechanisms of nanoconfined Li2S: implications for lithium-sulfur batteries	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							CHARGE-TRANSPORT MECHANISMS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; HIGH-CAPACITY; IN-SITU; POLYSULFIDES; TRANSITION; SURFACE; CARBON; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; ADSORPTION	Using Li2S as an active material and designing nanostructured cathode hosts are considered as promising strategies to improve the performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this study, the reaction mechanisms during the delithiation of nanoconfined Li2S as an active material, represented by a Li20S10 cluster, are examined by first-principles based calculations and analysis. Local reduction and disproportionation reactions can be observed although the overall delithiation process is an oxidation reaction. Long-chain polysulfides can form as intermediate products; however they may bind to insoluble S-2- via Li atoms as mediators. Activating the charging process only requires an overpotential of 0.37 V if using Li20S10 as the active material. Sulfur allotropes longer than cyclo-S-8 are observed at the end of the charge process. Although the discharge voltage of Li20S10 is only 1.27 V, it can still deliver an appreciable theoretical energy density of 1480 W h kg(-1). This study also suggests that hole polarons, in Li20S10 and intermediate products, can serve as carriers to facilitate charge transport. This work provides new insights toward revealing the detailed reaction mechanisms of nanoconfined Li2S as an active material in the Li-S battery cathode.

Nonetheless, the inferior conversion efficiency of polysulfides in essence leads to fast capacity decay during the discharge/charge cycle. In this work, it is successfully demonstrated that the conversion efficiency of lithium polysulfides is remarkably enhanced by employing a well-distributed atomic-scale Fe-based catalyst immobilized on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe@NG) as a coating of separator in lithium-sulfur batteries. The quantitative electrocatalytic efficiency of the conversion of lithium polysulfides is determined through cyclic voltammetry. It is also proven that the Fe-N(X)configuration with highly catalytic activity is quite beneficial for the conversion of lithium polysulfides. In addition, the adsorption and permeation experiments distinctly indicate that the strong anchoring effect, originated from the charge redistribution of N doping into the graphene matrix, inhibits the movement of lithium polysulfides. Thanks to these advantages, if the as-prepared Fe@NG catalyst is combined with polypropylene and applied as a separator (Fe@NG/PP) in Li-S batteries, a high initial capacity (1616 mA h g(-1)at 0.1 C), excellent capacity retention (93 % at 0.2 C, 70 % at 2 C), and superb rate performance (820 mA h g(-1)at 2 C) are achieved.

However, these materials have intrinsic problems such as low sulfur loading and poor rate capability at high C - rate due to the moderate conductivity of the composites. Here, we synthesize a wrapped S/rSP@SPAN composite using a dissolution-reprecipitation method followed by the thermal treatment. The idea is that the dissolution-reprecipitation of SP@PAN augments the surface area of the composite, which provides high sulfur loading and improves the composite - electrolyte contact, and conductivity of cathode material. As a result, the electrochemical performance of the as-fabricated S/rSP@SPAN cathode material yields excellent cyclability and high rate capability of 492 mAh g(-1) even at a high C - rate (10 degrees C) with high sulfur loading (54.5%).

However, developing a sulfur-rich copolymer with new chemical functionality to enhance performance of Li-S batteries remains a huge challenge. In this report, a sulfur-rich polymer cathode containing ionic liquid segments named poly(sulfur-co-1-vinyl-3-allylimidazolium bromide) [poly(S-co-DVIMBr)] was obtained by the inverse vulcanization of S-8 with DVIMBr and used as cathode for the first time. This sulfur-rich poly ionic liquid cathode showed effective suppression of the shuttle effect through joint effects of the stable chemical bonding of C-S and strong cation absorption for lithium polysulfides, which was confirmed by DFT calculations. In particular, the Li-S cell with poly(S-co-DVIMBr) cathode delivered high capacity retention of 90.22 % even over 900 cycles. Developing sulfur-rich poly ionic liquids may provide a new strategy of introducing the functional groups with cations into the cathode materials for suppressing the shuttle effect and improving the performance of Li-S batteries.

In this paper, MnO2 nanowires were embedded in ZIF-67 by polyvinylpyrrolidone modification and then carbonized at high temperature to obtain N-doped carbon (NC)-Co@MnO composites with high specific surface area and mesoporous structure for high sulfur loading. This conductive network structure provides a strong conductive pathway for LiPSs, promotes the adsorption of LiPSs, effectively facilitates electron transport, and enhances the trapping ability of LiPSs in the cathode. The prepared NCCo@MnO@S cathode has excellent electrochemical performance and stable charge-discharge performance because of the combination of the high conductivity of NC-Co with high specific surface area, as well as the strong interaction between MnO and polysulfide. The initial discharge specific capacity was 1175 mAh/g. The NC-Co@MnO@S composite can still maintain a stable discharge capacity of 700 mAh/g after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C with a capacity retention rate of 72%. This composite material has great promise for application as a low-cost, high-performance electrode for Li-S batteries.

However, the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in an ether electrolyte and its sluggish reaction kinetics severely limit their practical performances. Herein, an atomically dispersed supported metal catalyst with a Co-N-4 structure on active carbon (Co-N-C/AC) is prepared and introduced to modify the separators of Li-S batteries. The Co-N-C catalyst not only suppresses the shuttle effect of LiPSs through the physical barrier and chemical affinity but also improves the redox kinetics of the sulfur species. The first-principles calculation indicates that LiPSs on Co-N-C possess a high binding energy and low decomposition energy barrier in the electrochemical process, thus effectively accelerating the conversion of LiPSs during the charge/discharge process and improving sulfur utilization in Li-S batteries. Therefore, a Li-S battery based on a Co-N-C/AC modified separator can deliver admirable rate performance and stable cycling life with a reversible discharge capacity of over 865 mA h g(-1) and a decay rate of 0.043% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. This work provides new insights for developing a functional separator to accelerate the conversion kinetics of LiPSs for achieving high energy density Li-S batteries.

However, its actual application is still hindered by multiple challenges, such as the insulating nature of sulfur, irreversible loss of active material, and degradation of Li-metal anodes. In this paper, a functional sulfonated acetylene black (AB-SO3-) coated separator is designed to improve the overall performance of Li-S batteries. The AB-SO3- coated separator is highly permselective to lithium ions against polysulfide anions, while the incorporation of AB-SO3- coated separator does not influence the ion conductivity. Also the AB-SO3- coating could function as an upper current collector to facilitate electron transport for enhancing the electrochemical utilization of sulfur and ensuring the reactivation of the trapped active material. Therefore, the Li-S cell with the AB-SO3- coating exhibits significant improvement in both reversible capacity and cycling stability as compared to the cell with the pristine Celgard separator. When the mass of the AB-SO3- coating is counted into the whole mass of the sulfur cathode, the Li-S cell exhibits a high sulfur content of 70 wt% in the whole sulfur cathode region and 3.0 mg cm(-2) sulfur mass loading. This kind of a cell delivers a high initial capacity of 1262 mA h g(-1), and a superior capacity of 955 mA h g(-1) was retained after 100 cycles at 0.1C. Consequently, the sulfonated carbon coated separator is promising for the construction of high performance batteries.

By taking advantage of both capillary force driven self-assembly of polypyrrole on graphene nanosheets and adhesion ability of polypyrrole to sulfur, we develop a stable and ordered nano-S/PPy/GNS composite cathode for lithium/sulfur (Li/S) batteries. The high dispersion of nanoscopic sulfur on the surface of PPy/GNS composite and good electrical conductivity of GNS seems to benefit the sulfur utilization and the reactivity of the composite. Furthermore, PPy plays an important role in retarding diffusion of polysulfides out of the electrode. The resulting nano-S/PPy/GNS composite cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1415.7 mAh g(-1), remaining a reversible capacity of 641.5 mAh g(-1) after 40 cycles at 0.1 C rate.

It has been revealed that high surface area of carbon improves the utilization rate of active sulfur and decreases the real current density during the electrochemical reactions. Accordingly, increased reversible capacities and reduced polarization are observed for high surface area carbon hosts such as KB/S and graphene/S composites. The porous structure of KB or HCNS matrix promotes the long-term cycling stability of C/S composites but only at relatively low rate (0.2 C). Once the current density increases, the pore effect completely disappears and all Li-S batteries show similar trend of capacity degradation regardless of the different carbon hosts used in the cathodes. The reason has been assigned to the formation of reduced amount of irreversible Li2S on the cathode as well as shortened time for polysulfides to transport toward lithium anode at elevated current densities. This work provides valuable information for predictive selection on carbon materials to construct C/S composite for practical applications from the electrochemical point of view.

Inherent electrochemical activity of TiO2 (anatase, rutile) enhances the charge capacity of cathodes of lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Titanium dioxide; Lithium-sulfur battery; Coin cells; Mott-Schottky analysis; Flatband potential	REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; PERFORMANCE; CARBON; HOST; SEPARATOR; LAYERS	The addition of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (P90) to a cathode of Li/S cell enhances its voltammetric charge capacity by 19%, from which only a small fraction (ca. 1%) is assignable to the intrinsic Li-storage in TiO2. The flatband potential of anatase (the main component of P90) and rutile (the second main component of P90) equals 2.1 V vs. Li+/Li for both anatase and rutile. The S-8 reduction is triggered at the same potential, confirming that TiO2 behaves like an ideally rectifying semiconductor electrode for sulfur. The modification of glass-fiber separator by P90 further improves the charge capacity of the Li/S cell.

J	Wang, JY; Wang, WJ; Zhang, YG; Wang, Y; Zhao, Y				Wang, Jiayi; Wang, Wenjuan; Zhang, Yongguang; Wang, Yong; Zhao, Yan			Synthesis of CoO nanocrystals decorated porous carbon nanotube microspheres as sulfur host for high performance Li/S batteries	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						lithium/sulfur batteries; cathode materials; CoO; interconnected architecture; electrochemical performance	CATHODE; GRAPHENE; COMPOSITES; HYBRID; MOF	Lithium-sulfur (Li/S) batteries are promising portable energy storage devices if the defects of insufficient conductivity and obvious shuttle effect can be effectively suppressed. In this work, a unique caddice-like ball carbon nanotubes/CoO (CNTs/CoO) microspheres have been synthesized through a facile spray drying and following calcination method. By using cobalt acetate (Co(CHCOO)(2)) as a cobalt source, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a pore former and CNTs as the supporting frame, the as-prepared CNTs/CoO microspheres endowed with enriched interconnected pores and abundant scattered CoO nanoparticles on CNT walls. CNTs provided physical adsorption platforms for adsorption of polysulfides while ensuring the conductivity of the overall material. Polycrystalline CoO nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on CNT walls, providing additional confinement of polysulfides by strong chemical adsorption. In addition, the different content of CoO in the microspheres was regulated by the amount of added cobalt source during the preparation process. With both physical entrapment by CNTs and strong chemical interaction with CoO nanocrystals, this unique design can effectively promote the active material utilization and inhibit the shuttle effect. When employed as the sulfur host, an excellent electrochemical performance was achieved on the resulting sulfur-impregnated CNTs/CoO (S-CNTs/CoO) composite with the sulfur content of 73.0%. The obtained S-CNTs/CoO microspheres delivered an exceptional initial discharge capacity of 1340 mAh g(-1) and a prominent cycling stability of 1116 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, as well as a superb rate capability of 600 mAh g(-1) and 506 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C and 3.0 C, respectively. The results revealed that the S-CNTs/CoO composite was an enviable cathode material and showed an excellent potentiality in the application of Li/S batteries.

However, the persisting issues of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) dissolution and shuttling severely impedes their practical applications. To address this challenge, we synthesized hierarchical porous carbon nanonet flakes (CNNFs) decorated with a small amount of loosely distributed MoS2, as an effective interlayer for LiPSs stabilization. Due to the special hierarchical porous structures with large abundant micro-, meso-, and macro-pores derived from the linear-PEI-templated CNNFs and the chemisorption and electrocatalytic effects for MoS2, the shuttling of the soluble polysulfides intermediates is efficiently alleviated, accompanied by a stabilized Li+ transportation pathway for the cell. A high initial capacity of 1413.8 mA h.g(-1) at 0.1 C and a stable capacity of 897.5 mA h.g(-1) at 0.5 C after 200 cycles are obtained, corresponding to a capacity decay rate of 0.063% per cycle. Moreover, after 500 cycles at 1 C, a discharging capacity of 515.7 mA h g(-1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.7% can be obtained. The trapping of polysulfides and the synergistic maintenance of electron and ion pathway can provide an effective stabilization strategy for high-performance lithium-sulfur battery.

J	Li, GC; Zhao, W; Liu, L; Chen, L				Li, Guochun; Zhao, Wen; Liu, Liang; Chen, Long			Effects of electrolyte concentration and synthesis methods of sulfur/carbon composites on the electrochemical performance in lithium-sulfur batteries	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							CATHODE MATERIAL; GRAPHENE; SOLVENT; CELL	Three synthesis methods are adopted in this study for the preparation of sulfur/carbon composites for rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries, namely, melting (155 degrees C)-vaporizing (300 degrees C), ball milling, and ball milling-melting (155 degrees C). The structure, composition, and morphology of the samples are characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and elemental mapping analysis. The effects of electrolyte concentration and synthesis methods on the electrochemical performance of composites are also investigated. Results show that active sulfur disperses with carbon matrix more uniformly in the sulfur/carbon composite prepared by melting-vaporizing method. The assembled cell delivers an extraordinarily high initial discharge capacity of 1856.2 mA h g(-1) when measured in the electrolyte with 5 M LiTFSI in DOL/TEGDME at a current density of 160 mA g(-1); the capacity can still be retained at 905.3 mA h g(-1) after 125 cycles. When measured at a higher current density of 800 mA g(-1), a reversible capacity of 546.3 mA h g(-1) can be maintained after 500 long-term cycles. The preferable electrochemical performance of the composite electrode is attributed to the high dispersibility of the carbon matrix and active sulfur in the composite, as well as the high concentration of lithium salt in the electrolyte. This work provides an optimized approach to obtain sulfur/carbon composites with remarkably improved electrochemical performance for lithium-sulfur batteries.

The prepared HCNF@NPC-S composite with high sulfur content of 77.5 wt.% showed an obvious core-shell structure with an NPC layer coating on the surface of the HCNFs and sulfur homogeneously distributed in the coating layer. This material exhibited much better electrochemical performance than the HCNF-S composite, delivered initial discharge capacity of 1170 mAh g(-1), and maintains 590 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at the current density of 837.5 mA g(-1) (0.5 C). The significantly improved electrochemical performance of the HCNF@NPC-S composite was attributed to the synergetic effect between HCNF cores, which provided electronic conduction pathways and worked as mechanical support, and the NPC shells with relatively high surface area and pore volume, which could trap sulfur/polysulfides and provide Li+ conductive pathways.

A double suspension of commercial sulfur and carbon scaffolding particles was dispersed in ethanol/water, solution and sprayed at 180 degrees C using a spray pyrolysis system. In the resultant composites, the sulfur particles were subjected to an ultrashort sublimation process, leading to the development of a highly porous surface, and were meanwhile coated with amorphous carbon, obtained through the pyrolysis of the ethanol, which acts as an adhesive interface to bind together the porous sulfur with the scaffolding carbon particles, to form a ternary composite architecture. This material has an effective conducting-carbon/sulfur-based matrix and interconnected open pores to reduce. the diffusion paths of lithium ions, buffer the sulfur volumetric expansion, and absorb electrolyte and polysulfides. Because of the unique chemistry and the structure, the composites show stable cycling performance for 200 cycles and good rate capability of 520 mAh g(-1) at 2 C. This advanced spray-pyrolysis/sublimation method is easy to scale up and shows great potential for commercialization of lithium/sulfur batteries.

We describe here a strategy of fabricating extremely dense sulfur cathodes, designed by integrating Mo6S8 nanoparticles as a multi-functional mediator with a Li-ion conducting binder and a high-performance Fe3O4@N-carbon sulfur host. The Mo6S8 nanoparticles have substantially faster Li-ion insertion kinetics compared with sulfur, and the produced LixMo6S8 particles have spontaneous redox reactivity with relevant polysulfide species (such as Li4Mo6S8 + Li2S4 <-> Li3Mo6S8 + Li2S, Delta G = -84 kJ mol(-1)), which deliver a true redox catalytic sulfur conversion mechanism. In addition, LixMo6S8 particles strongly absorb polysulfide during battery cycling, which provides a quasi-solid sulfur conversion pathway and almost eliminated polysulfide dissolution. Such a pathway not only promotes growth of uniform Li2S that can be readily charged back with nearly no overpotential, but also mitigates the polysulfide-induced Li metal corrosion issue. The combination of these benefits enables stable and high capacity cycling of dense sulfur cathodes under a low electrolyte to sulfur ratio (4.2 mu L mg(-1)), as demonstrated with cathodes with volumetric capacities of at least 1.3 Ah cm(-3) and capacity retentions of similar to 80% for 300 cycles. Furthermore, stable cycling of batteries under a practically relevant N/P ratio of 2.4 is also demonstrated.

The main challenge for developing long-life and high-performance Li-S batteries is to simultaneously restrain the shuttle of soluble polysulfides while accelerating the redox kinetics of sulfur-related species during cell operation. Herein, a sandwich-type sulfur@Co/N-doped carbon (S@Co-NC) ternary composite is synthesized, combining in a simple way the advantages of synergetic physical and chemical confinement on sulfur-related species. A further electrochemical redox kinetic study confirms that the incorporated conductive Co mediators and doped N species serve as dual electrocatalysts, substantially accelerating the kinetics of the polysulfide redox reactions. By relieving the sluggishness of polysulfide redox reactions, the as-obtained sandwich-type S@Co-NC composite has significantly promoted electrochemical performance including enhanced rate capability, lower polarization and higher Coulombic efficiency. It delivers extremely high discharge capacity of 1401 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C with an area sulfur loading of 1.3 mg cm(-2). More importantly, the ternary electrode retains a high rate capability of 694 mAh g(-1) over extensive 600 cycles at 1 C, with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency maintenance. These results suggest that the S@Co-NC ternary composite provides possibility of realizing the industrially practical Li-S batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to much improved electrical conductivity in the modified cathode materials, better reaction kinetics was demonstrated in comparison with the conventional sulfur electrode. Overall, the electrochemical performances significantly increased between 0 and 1.25 wt% of the nano-Al additive, then decreased successively between 1.25 and about 5 wt%. Maximal electrochemical activity was observed for about 1.25 wt%, and the resultant revealed highest rate capacity and cyclic stability. Specifically, the prepared electrode can deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 978 mAh g(-1) and remain a reversible capacity of 696 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at a charge-discharge rate of 0.2C. With nano-Al content higher than 1.25 wt%, the electrochemical performances tend to be negatively affected due to the reduction in sulfur-carbon interfaces and more obstruction in Li+ ion migration and diffusion.

The effects of carbon material structure, morphology, surface area, pore volume, sulfur loading, electrolyte/sulfur ratio and metallic Pt nanoparticle decoration impact on the adsorption of polysulfides and battery performance are studied. Results show that carbon material carrying rod-like morphology and hexagonal meso-structure can have high sulfur loading due to its high specific surface area and large pore volume. While the one with polyhedral particles and ordered cubic meso-structure exhibits good cyclic stability and good capacity retention due to its good adsorption of polysulfides upon its cage-like pores. After in-situ decorating of Pt nanoparticles, the performance of cyclic stability as well as capacity retention significantly improved and better rate performance is also gained because of the chemisorption of polysulfides and electro-catalytic activity upon Pt.

However, due to the insulation and shuttling effect, the low load mass and continuous capacity fading remain as two substantial obstacles for the practical use of Li-S batteries. Herein, a free-standing macroscopic nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide film (MrGO) is fabricated for acting as the S host (MrGO/S). Profiting from the macroscopic structure and nitrogen doping, the MrGO/S film possesses high S proportion and outstanding electrical conductivity. The adsorption test, simulation, and calculations demonstrate the strong adsorption capacity between MrGO and polysulfides, which effectively refrain the shuttle effect. As a result, the designed MrGO/S cathode exhibits a high specific capacity (1225.0 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C) and outstanding cycling stability (92.3% remaining after 100 cycles at 0.5 C). More importantly, MrGO/S-based pouch cells with high S loading mass (4.0 mg cm(-2)) exhibit excellent electrochemical performance and flexibility. This research could provide an effective solution for high-performance Li-S batteries through structural optimization of graphene.

However, the undesirable shuttle effect and low utilization of sulfur caused by dissolution and migration of polysulfide intermediates greatly restrict their practical application. Herein, we report a functional separator modified with novel ultrathin hollow carbon spheres (UHCSs) to improve the overall performance of LSBs and demonstrate for the first time that nonporous hollow structured carbon materials are ideal candidates for modifying the separator due to their unique properties. The ultrathin and nonporous shell of the coated UHCSs can act as a physical and a chemical barrier to effectively entrap lithium polysulfides owing to fewer diffusion sites. The UHCSs can also enhance the electron transfer for sulfur and accommodate the large volume change of sulfur as upper current collectors. When applying such UHCSs functionalized separators, the LSBs achieved a significantly improved electrochemical performance including a high capacity of 1346.3mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and high rate capability with a discharge capacity of 458 mA h g(-1) even at 5C upon 1000 cycles.

However, the intrinsic problems of the sulfur cathode severely restrict their further practical application. Here, a unique double-shell architecture composed of hollow carbon spheres@interlayer-expanded and sulfur-enriched MoS2+x nanocoating composite has been developed as an efficient sulfur host. A uniform precursor coating derived from heteropolyanions-induced polymerization of pyrrole leads to space confinement effect during the in-situ sulfurization process, which generates the interlayer-expanded and sulfur-enriched MoS2+x nanosheets on amorphous carbon hollow spheres. This new sulfur host possesses multifarious merits including sufficient voids for loading sulfur active materials, high electronic conductivity, and fast lithium-ion diffusive pathways. In addition, additional active edge sites of MoS2+x accompanied by the nitrogen-doped carbon species endow the sulfur host with immobilizing and catalyzing effects on the soluble polysulfide species, dramatically accelerating their conversion kinetics and re-utilization. The detailed defect-induced interface catalytic reaction mechanism is firstly proposed. As expected, the delicately-designed sulfur host exhibits an outstanding initial discharge capacity of 1,249 mAh center dot g(-1) at 0.2 C and a desirable rate performance (593 mAh center dot g(-1) at 5.0 C), implying its great prospects in achieving superior electrochemical performances for advanced lithium sulfur batteries.

However, one of the major challenges for Li-S battery development is to overcome the rapid capacity decay arising from polysulfide dissolution. Herein, a self-standing carbon nanofiber (CNF) matt derived from polyimide is fabricated by a simple, yet versatile electrospinning technique. An optimized CNF matt is introduced between sulfur cathode and separator that act as an interlayer, providing continuous pathway for electronic and ionic interactions, which accommodates volume expansion and impedes dissolution of the polysulfide intermediate species. The resulting sulfur-based Li-S cell delivers high specific initial discharge capacity of 1474mAhg(-1) and retains capacity of 1014mAhg(-1) even after 100 cycles at 1Ag(-1) current density. Further, the cell demonstrated good reversible capacity for 500 cycles as well as excellent rate capability. This study demonstrates that CNF matt provides significant improvement in capturing polysulfides intermediate species from electrolyte that can extend the life span of sulfur cathode for long-standing applications.

However, the synthesis of such materials usually involves high temperature or complicated equipment. Graphene-based sulfur composites have been recently developed to prolong the cycling life of Li-S batteries, one of the most attractive energy-storage devices. Given the high cost of graphene, there is significant demand to recycle and reuse graphene from Li-S batteries. Herein, we report a green and cost-effective method to prepare sulfur-doped graphene, achieved by the continuous charge/discharge cycling of graphene-sulfur composites in Li-S batteries. This material was used as a metal-free electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction and shows better electrocatalytic activity than pristine graphene and better methanol tolerance durability than Pt/C.

Herein, a novel hollow architecture composed of ZnS-FeS heterostructures encapsulated in N-doped carbon is designed for the first time as a high-efficiency catalyst to propel polysulfide redox kinetics, in which the ZnS-FeS heterostructures are mosaiced in the carbon framework through a simple in situ sulfuration process. Kinetic analyses and theoretical calculation verify that the abundant heterojunctions could facilitate electron and ion transfer, strengthen the combination with polysulfides and boost the polysulfide redox reaction kinetics. Ex situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed the excellent interface solid-liquid-solid conversion reaction. Benefiting from the state-of-the-art design, the S@ZnS-FeS@NC electrode shows an outstanding rate capacity (718 mA h g(-1) at 4.0C) and favorable cycling stability (822 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 200 cycles). Our approach would be a proof-of-concept design of metal sulfide heterojunctions as an effective sulfur host in improving the polysulfide redox kinetics for lithium sulfur batteries.

In particular, suppression of polysulfide (PS)-shuttle behavior that occurs during electrochemical reaction in Li-S batteries is the most important challenge for practical, large-scale applications. In this work, a natural-wood-derived polymer, lignosulfonate sodium salt (LSS), is employed as a binder material for Li-S, showing superior capacity and cycle retention because of its unique chemical structure. LSS with amphiphilic functional groups can easily disperse hydrophobic electrode components in water and effectively block PS dissolution by its electrostatic repulsion force. Moreover, with enhanced Li ionic conductivity, the rate capability of the S cathode is maintained at similar to 661 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 1675 mA g(-1) and stable areal capacity of similar to 1.55 mA h cm(-2) is obtained with pristine S active material.

One of the effective solutions to address these problems is to improve the sulfiphilicity of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and the lithiophilicity of the lithium anode. However, it is a great challenge to simultaneously optimize both aspects. Herein, by incorporating the merits of strong absorbability and high conductivity of SnS with good catalytic capability of ZnS, a ZnS-SnS heterojunction coated with a polydopamine-derived N-doped carbon shell (denoted as ZnS-SnS@NC) with uniform cubic morphology was obtained and compared with the ZnS-SnS2@NC heterostructure and its single-component counterparts (SnS@NC and SnS2@NC). Theoretical calculations, ex situ XANES, and in situ Raman spectrum were utilized to elucidate rapid anchoring-diffusion-transformation of LiPSs, inhibition of the shuttling effect, and improvement of the sulfur electrochemistry of bimetal ZnS-SnS heterostructure at the molecular level. When applied as a modification layer coated on the separator, the ZnS-SnS@NC-based cell with optimized lithiophilicity and sulfiphilicity enables desirable sulfur electrochemistry, including high reversibility of 1149 mAh g(-1) for 300 cycles at 0.2 C, high rate performance of 661 mAh g(-1) at 10 C, and long cycle life with a low fading rate of 0.0126% each cycle after 2000 cycles at 4 C. Furthermore, a favorable areal capacity of 8.27 mAh cm(-2) is maintained under high sulfur mass loading of 10.3 mg cm(-2). This work furnishes a feasible scheme to the rational design of bimetal sulfides heterostructures and boosts the development of other electrochemical applications.

Understanding the Charging Mechanism of Lithium-Sulfur Batteries Using Spatially Resolved Operando X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIAL; ION BATTERIES; ENERGY; POLYSULFIDES; CELLS; ELECTROLYTE; PARTICLES; SPECTRA	Replacement of conventional cars with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) offers an opportunity to significantly reduce future carbon dioxide emissions. One possible way to facilitate widespread acceptance of BEVs is to replace the lithium-ion batteries used in existing BEVs with a lithium-sulfur battery, which operates using a cheap and abundant raw material with a high specific energy density. These significant theoretical advantages of lithium-sulfur batteries over the lithium-ion technology have generated a lot of interest in the system, but the development of practical prototypes, which could be successfully incorporated into BEVs, remains slow. To accelerate the development of improved lithium-sulfur batteries, our work focuses on the mechanistic understanding of the processes occurring inside the battery. In particular, we study the mechanism of the charging process and obtain spatially resolved information about both solution and solid phase intermediates in two locations of an operating Li2S-Li battery: the cathode and the separator. These measurements were made possible through the combination of a spectro-electrochemical cell developed in our laboratory and synchrotron based operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. Using the generated data, we identify a charging mechanism in a standard DOL-DME based electrolyte, which is consistent with both the first and subsequent charging processes. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

A low cost of raw materials and a simple synthesis are also important prerequisites for product commercialization. In this paper, zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped 3D-carbon nanosheets (NCNS) are proposed as modified separator materials. During high-temperature carbonization of the carbon materials, a zinc sulphide phase transition occurs, resulting in an anion vacancy (S2-) and an unsaturated Zn centre. While maintaining catalytic activity, the unsaturated Zn centre in ZnS acts as a Lewis acid to form a coordinate bond with the polysulfide. Furthermore, a uniform distribution of N heteroatoms can effectively regulate Li+ flux through the separator, thereby achieving a stable cycle for the lithium anode. A cell with the ZnS/NCNS-modified separator can achieve a stable cycle at 0.5 C and superior electrochemical performance even with an areal sulfur loading of 6 mg cm(-2). An excellent reduction in self-discharge was also confirmed by a 4% capacity attenuation after resting for 4 days. This work provides new insight on the design and preparation of novel separators for highly stable Li-S batteries via a "green" and cost-effective approach.

In this paper, we have explored the potential of a quaternary ammonium cationic polymer, polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDADMA-X; X = T, B, P, and Cl) with different counter anions (TFSI-, BF4-, PF6-, and Cl-, respectively) as the bifunctional binder. We have also revealed the dramatic effects of the counter anion on the performance of the cationic polymer binder. PDADMA-X's containing the former three weakly associating anions have been demonstrated to show polysulfide adsorption capability. In particular, PDADMA-T having the largest, least interacting TFSI- anion shows the optimum performance, with strong binding strength and the best polysulfide adsorption capability. Relative to commercial PVDF and PDADMA-X's of other counter anions, it offers sulfur cathodes with lowered polarization, higher discharge capacity, significantly better capacity retention, and improved cycling stability. With its convenient synthesis from commercially available PDADMA-Cl, cationic PDADMA-T having the TFSI- anion is a promising bifunctioal binder for sulfur cathodes in practical Li-sulfur batteries.

However, the low areal sulfur loading impedes their commercial development. Herein, a 3D free-standing sulfur cathode scaffold is rationally designed and fabricated by coaxially coating polar Ti3C2Tx flakes on sulfur-impregnated carbon cloth (Ti3C2Tx@S/CC) to achieve high loading and high energy density Li-S batteries, in which, the flexible CC substrate with highly porous structure can accommodate large amounts of sulfur and ensure fast electron transfer, while the outer-coated Ti3C2Tx can serve as a polar and conductive protective layer to further promote the conductivity of the whole electrode, achieve physical blocking and chemical anchoring of lithium-polysulfides as well as catalyze their conversion. Due to these advantages, at a sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2), Li-S cells with Ti3C2Tx@S/CC cathodes can deliver outstanding cycling stability (746.1 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C), superb rate performance (866.8 mAh g(-1) up to 2 C) and a high specific energy density (564.2 Wh kg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C). More significantly, they also show the commercial potential that can compete with current lithium-ion batteries due to the high areal capacity of 6.7 mAh cm(-2) at the increased loading of 8 mg cm(-2).

The pyrolysis accompanied by carbothermal reduction enables in situ template removal without toxic/reactive gases as by products and no further purification steps are required. Since the hierarchical porous carbon offers a specific surface area exceeding 2600 m(2) g(-1) as well as a high internal pore volume of 2.46 cm(3) g(-1) the novel material is well suited as sulfur host material to be implemented in cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries. This leads to an initial discharge capacity of 1225 mAh g(-1) sulfur and, moreover, a stable capacity of over 950 mAh g(-1) (sulfur) for 100 cycles. Of outstanding importance is the fact, that the synergistic advantage of the hierarchical pore network ensures remarkable sulfur utilizations as well as cycle stabilities at low electrolyte amounts down to 4 mu l mg(-1) (sulfur) (coin cell). Low electrolyte LiS cell concepts (LE-LiS) are essential for the development of high energy density on cell level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, major challenges still remain in the application of Li-S batteries, such as shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics. Herein, it is demonstrated that phosphorus doping can not only significantly improve the polysulfide adsorption but also enhance the catalysis effects of metal-organic framework-derived CoS2 nanoboxes in Li-S batteries. Consequently, a modified separator integrated with P-CoS2 and carbon nanotubes effectively suppresses the polysulfide shuttle and propels the redox kinetics of polysulfides, thus promising higher specific discharge capacity, better rate, and stable cycle performance. Even under the high sulfur loading condition (4.8 mg cm(-2)), the areal discharge capacity of the cell with the functional separator can still remain at 4.5 mA h cm(-2) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. More importantly, this work may encourage more effort on anion doping for engineering the polar surface of transition-metal compounds to further mediate the interfacial redox chemistry between transition-metal compounds and polysulfides in Li-S batteries.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is hindered by critical issues, including the migration of the dissolved lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) from the sulfur electrode to the lithium metal anode, resulting in poor cycling stability. Here, we report a multifunctional interlayer configured with an N-doped carbon framework and titanium nitride nanowires on a polypropylene separator (NC/TiN NWs@PP) to suppress the polysulfide shuttling problem. NC/TiN NWs@PP can be obtained by electrospinning and the subsequent scalable solution-based vacuum filtration. The one-dimensional structure of the TiN NWs can shorten the Li-ion diffusion distance with large electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Furthermore, the N-doped carbon framework in the NWs enables facile electron transportation and allows the suppression of the shuttle effect to improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics. The Li-S battery with a NC/TiN NWs@PP separator exhibited enhanced cycling stability and rate capability, indicating that this could be a new research direction for Li-S batteries.

The low ionic and electronic conductivity of these polymers, however, limit their cycling performance at high active mass loadings. Moreover, Li-polysulfide (Li-PS) shuttling, a fatal phenomenon in the cyclability of Li-S batteries, can be mitigated via the entrapment of Li-PS by utilizing various supramolecular interactions. Herein, we report a new approach that incorporates one-dimensional charged polypyrrole into a two-dimensional covalent triazine framework (cPpy-S-CTF) synthesized in the presence of elemental sulfur. The cPpy-S-CTF enabled sulfur loadings up to 83 wt %, thanks to the perfluoroaryl-elemental sulfur SNAr chemistry. Notably, the addition of charged polypyrrole, cPpy, triggered a 3D nanochannel formation in the cPpy-S-CTF with high-affinity anchoring sites toward Li-PS, while achieving decent ionic and electronic conductivity. The cPpy-S-CTF showed a remarkable electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 1203.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C, an initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.1%, and a capacity retention of 86.8% after 500 cycles.

Moreover, poor sulfur electrochemical utilization and rapid capacity degradation are top concerns in the high-loading Li-S batteries, which severely hinder their practical applications. Herein, a completely novel porous nanoneedle array NiCo2S4 electrocatalyst grown on a nitrogen-sulfur-doped carbon cloth (NSCC) (NiCo2S4@NSCC) is constructed as a 3D self-supported sulfur host for high-loading Li-S batteries, in which the highest sulfur loading reaches 4.9 mg cm(-2). The as-prepared NiCo2S4@NSCC with a typical sulfur loading of around 2.0 mg cm(-2) provides a high discharge capacity of 1223 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and long-term cycle stability with a low capacity decay of 0.046% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C. Additionally, NiCo2S4@NSCC/S with a high sulfur loading of 4.9 mg cm(-2) delivers an excellent reversible areal capacity of 4.4 mA h cm(-2) g over 50 cycles. Noting that such superior electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4@NSCC/S with high-loading sulfur is mainly attributed to high electronic conductivity and the abundant porous structure of NSCC to transport electrons and ions fastly and accommodate sulfur as well as robust absorbability and the outstanding catalytic effect of NiCo2S4 to accelerate the capture and conversion of the polysulfide intermediate. Predictably, this work can provide a guideline to efficiently and rationally design the structure of metal-based compounds with catalytic functions for various applications.

In this work, combining characterization methods of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ optical microscopy, and three-electrode measurement, a direct comparison between these two battery systems is made to reveal the mechanism behind their performance differences. In addition to polysulfides, it is found that the initial elemental sulfur can also dissolve into and diffuse through the SPE to reach the anode. Different from the shuttle effect that causes uniform corrosion on the anode in a liquid electrolyte, dissolved sulfur species in SPE unevenly passivate the anode surface and lead to the inhomogeneous Li+ plating/stripping at the anode/SPE solid-solid interface. Such inhomogeneity eventually causes void formation at the interface, which leads to the failure of SPE-ASSLS batteries. Based on this understanding, a protection interlayer is designed to inhibit the shuttling of sulfur species, and the modified SPE-ASSLS batteries show much-improved performance in cycle life.

Herein, an ultrafine, amorphous, and oxygendeficient niobium pentoxide nanocluster embedded in microporous carbon nanospheres (A-Nb2O5-x@MCS) was developed as a multifunctional sulfur immobilizer and promoter toward superior shuttle inhibition and conversion catalyzation of LPS. The A-Nb2O5-x nanocluster implanted framework uniformizes sulfur distribution, exposes vast active interfaces, and offers a reduced ion/electron transportation pathway for expedited redox reaction. Moreover, the low crystallinity feature of A-Nb2O5-x manipulates the LPS chemical affinity, while the defect chemistry enhances the intrinsic conductivity and catalytic activity for rapid electrochemical conversions. Attributed to these superiorities, A-Nb2O5-x@MCS delivers good Li-S battery performances, that is, high areal capacity of 6.62 mAh cm(-2) under high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio, superb rate capability, and cyclability over 1200 cycles with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.024% per cycle. This work provides a synergistic regulation on crystallinity and oxygen deficiency toward rapid and durable sulfur electrochemistry, holding a great promise in developing practically viable Li-S batteries and enlightening material engineering in related energy storage and conversion areas.

Herein, a completely new polymeric binder of polyethersulfone is introduced. Not only it enables massive production of flexible/current-free electrode by a novel concept of phase-inversion approach but also the resultant polymeric networks can effectively trap the soluble polysulfides within the electrode, owing to the higher hydrophilicity and stronger affinity properties than the routine polyvinylidene fluoride. Coupling with polysulfide-based electrolyte, the Li-S cell shows a higher capacity of 1141 mAh g(-1), a lower polarization of 192 mV, and a more stable capacity retention with 100% Coulombic efficiency over 100 cycles at 0.25C. The advantages of favored binder and electrolyte are further demonstrated in lithium-ion sulfur full battery with lithiated graphite anode, which demonstrates much improved performance than those previously reported. This work not only introduces a novel strategy for flexible freestanding electrodes but also enlightens the importance of coupling electrodes and electrolytes to higher performances for Li-S battery.

This owes to their ability to accommodate a large amount of sulfur in their interspaces. Also, this solution does require neither a binder nor a current collector. As a drawback, the application of free-standing CNT frameworks suffers from the abundance of their inherent macroporosities, as these promote the diffusion of polysulfides. In this work, we address this issue by incorporating disordered mesoporous carbon (DMC), as a polysulfide reservoir, into a CNT matrix to form CNT-DMC hybrid film. We apply facile hot-pressing to incorporate sulfur into the composite electrode. Furthermore, we determine the electrochemical performances of CNT-DMC/sulfur (S) cathode by a galvanostatic method. We find that the CNT-DMC/S cathode exhibits a high initial capacity of 1032 mAh/g at 0.25 C and a superior capacity retention of 92% after 100 cycles, compared to sulfur-impregnated CNT cathode. We attribute these enhancements to the efficient polysulfide absorption ability of DMC. This novel approach bears a high potential for the development of high-performance Li-S batteries with flexible sulfur cathodes.

Herein, a multidimensional N-doped porous carbon/MoS2/CNT (FSC/MoS2/CNT) nano-architecture hybrid is rationally designed and successfully fabricated by the facile pyrolysis and hydrothermal processes. For the nano-architecture composite, the porous carbon embedded with electroconductive acid-treated CNTs effectively enhances the flexibility and constructs a conductive network for rapid ion/electron transfer; specifically, a synergistic action of polar MoS2 and electronegative doped N atoms significantly strengthens the chemical affinity with polysulfides; furthermore, MoS2 exhibits a strong catalytic effect that can improve the redox kinetics of polysulfides. On account of the merits mentioned above, the as-built N-doped porous carbon/MoS2/CNTs@S (FSC/MoS2/CNTs@S) composite, utilized as the Li-S battery cathode, delivers a high discharge capacity of 1313.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, glorious rate performance with 671.6 mA h g(-1) at 2.0C and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity fading rate of 0.059% per cycle for 500 cycles at 1.0C. This work provides a novel and simple strategy to design a CNT decorated polar and conductive hybrid network of doped porous carbon/transition metal sulfide for application in excellent performance Li-S batteries and numerous energy storage fields.

Here we report a facile in situ method for preparing three-dimensional porous graphitic carbon composites containing sulfur nanoparticles (3D S@PGC). With this strategy, the sulfur content of the composites can be tuned to a high level (up to 90 wt%). Because of the high sulfur content, the nanoscale distribution of the sulfur particles, and the covalent bonding between the sulfur and the PGC, the developed 3D S@PGC cathodes exhibit excellent performance, with a high sulfur utilization, high specific capacity (1,382, 1,242 and 1,115 mA h g(-1) at 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively), long cycling life (small capacity decay of 0.039% per cycle over 1,000 cycles at 2 C) and excellent rate capability at a high charge/discharge current.

However, its applications are still greatly hindered by some inherent problems such as uncontrollable deposition of lithium sulfide and the shuttle effect induced by lithium polysulfides. Herein, separators modified with Ketjenblack-In2O3 (KB-IO) nanoparticles were used to ease these problems and to improve the cycling stability and rate performance of the Li-S battery. Experimental results suggest that the KB-IO-modified separator has a considerable absorption capability on lithium polysulfides as well as a good catalytic effect on electrochemical reaction kinetics. At 1C, the initial specific discharge capacities of the Li-S cells with the KB-IO-modified separator is as high as 1050mAhg(-1) and maintains 631mAhg(-1) after 700cycles. Moreover, the cells also show an appreciable rate performance of 832mAhg(-1) even at a rate of 2C, and this rate performance is much higher than that of the sample with the unmodified separator and that of the sample with the pure KB-modified separator.

Herein, an inexpensive and effective carbon precursor, catechol and polyamine is explored to fabricate nitrogen/oxygen dual-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (DHCSs) as sulfur hosts. The group containing nitrogen and oxygen can provide stronger chemisorption for lithium polysulfides than single-doped carbon matrix, which is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis and the theoretical calculation. As a result, the designed sulfur/DHCSs cathode delivers a stable cycling performance remained 851 mAh g(-1) discharge capacity at 0.2 C with similar to 0.08% capacity decay per cycle after 200 cycles, revealing its great promise for energy storage application.

Direct Measurement of Polysulfide Shuttle Current: A Window into Understanding the Performance of Lithium-Sulfur Cells	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; CARBON NANOTUBES; FUNDAMENTAL CHEMISTRY; HIGH-CAPACITY; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; DENSITY	The shuttling of polysulfide ions between the electrodes in a lithium-sulfur battery is a major technical issue limiting the self-discharge and cycle life of this high-energy rechargeable battery. Although there have been attempts to suppress the shuttling process, there has not been a direct measurement of the rate of shuttling. We report here a simple and direct measurement of the rate of the shuttling (that we term "shuttle current"), applicable to the study of any type of lithium-sulfur cell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this measurement technique using cells with and without lithium nitrate (a widely-used shuttle suppressor additive). We present a phenomenological analysis of the shuttling process and simulate the shuttle currents as a function of the state-of-charge of a cell. We also demonstrate how the rate of decay of the shuttle current can be used to predict the capacity fade in a lithium-sulfur cell due to the shuttle process. We expect that this new ability to directly measure shuttle currents will provide greater insight into the performance differences observed with various additives and electrode modifications that are aimed at suppressing the rate of shuttling of polysulfide ions and increasing the cycle life of lithium-sulfur cells.

However, the sluggish kinetics of S and Li2S solid conversion results in low discharge capacity at high active material loading, which is critical for ASSLSBs to implement the high energy density potential. Herein, nitrogen doped-carbon (NC) coated Li2S (Li2S@NC composite) is developed for ASSLSBs that highly improves electrochemical performance. A thin and uniform nitrogen doped-carbon layer is coated on Li2S via pyrolysis deposition approach to prepare Li2S@NC. The as obtained Li2S@NC composite exhibits greatly enhanced electrochemical performance with high reversible capacity, high coulombic efficiency of similar to 100%, good rate capability and cycling stability. Particularly, outstanding electrochemical performance with high capacity of 931 mAh g(-1) can also be obtained at both high Li2S content (43%) and high areal Li2S loading (10.4 mg cm(-2)).

To overcome this problem for achieving longer cycle life and higher rate performance, anchoring materials for lithium polysulfides are highly desirable. In this work, for the first time, we report phosphorene-like MX (M=Ge, Sn; X=S, Se) monolayers as promising anchoring materials to restrain the lithium polysulfides shuttling. Our study provides fundamental selection criteria for the effective suppression of the polysulfides shuttling. Adsorption calculations reveal that polysulfide capture by the MX is through chemisorption with a suitable range of adsorption energies. Morever, we show that excellent surface diffusion of Li and polysulfides endow a fast charge/discharge rate for lithium-sulfur batteries. Graphene with desirable electronic properties is constructed to improve the electrical conductivity in the new graphene@MX heterostructures. Based on the strong anchoring ability, improved rate capability, and enhanced conductivity, MX-based composites hold great promise as an anchoring material for high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries.

An NiO sheet with a network structure was developed via a simple two-step method and used as a mediator for a lithium-sulfur battery coupled with a carbon layer on the cathode side. Specifically, by introducing a thin carbon layer on the cathode side of the separator the dissolution of polysulfides was effectively hindered, and moreover the rate capability and long-term stability were effectively enhanced by the further addition of network NiO nanosheets owing to their mesoporous channels and the NiO-S interaction. Besides, in comparison with the cell performance at different S loadings, the cathode with 80 wt% of S in the total electrode exhibited a high specific capacity and excellent rate performance up to 5C. In addition, although the redox potential range of NiO did not form part of the recharging potential window, NiO exhibited an obvious interaction with polysulfides and limited their tendency to dissolve. The present study demonstrates that the joint action of network NiO and the carbon layer presents great potential to be used in low-cost and high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries and provides important guidance for the design of a multifunctional sulfur host for the battery cathodes.

However, its launch into practical application is still shackled by various challenges. A rational nanostructure of hollow carbon nanoboxes filled with birnessite-type manganese oxide nanosheets (MnO2@HCB) as a new class of molecularly-designed physical and chemical trap for lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx (x = 4-8)) is reported. The bifunctional, integrated, hybrid nanoboxes overcome the obstacles of low sulfur loading, poor conductivity, and redox shuttle of LSBs via effective physical confinement and chemical interaction. Benefiting from the synergistic encapsulation, the developed MnO2@HCB/S hybrid nanoboxes with 67.9 wt% sulfur content deliver high specific capacity of 1042 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 1 A g(-1) with excellent Coulombic efficiency approximate to 100%, and retain improved reversible capacity during long term cycling at higher current densities. The developed strategy paves a new path for employing other metal oxides with unique architectures to boost the performance of LSBs.

Among biomass materials, yeast is an ideal and natural precursor which is used to synthesize carbon materials. A novel method was deliberately developed to fabricate the Co-embedded N&P-codoped hierarchical porous yeast-based carbon (Co-YC) for Li-S batteries. Firstly, yeasts immersed by aqueous solution containing CoCl2 and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDS) were freeze-dried, and then were pyrolyzed at 973 K for 3 h under the protection of argon. The as-prepared Co-YC materials with higher specific surface area (216.94 m(2) g(-1)) were finally used to load sulfur, suggesting that the meso/macroporous structure is helpful to avoiding the accumulation of sulfur on the surface of the materials. Subsequently the electrode equipped by Co-YC/S with a superior cycling stability and rate performance than YC/S has been successfully prepared. The obtained Co-YC/S electrode exhibited a better electrochemical performance, its discharge capacity reached 1462 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.1 C, and after 300 cycles, the stable reversible capacity was of 1010.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. The experimental results show that Co-YC/S can be a potential candidate for electrode material applied in Li-S batteries.

Herein, we develop a stringed tube on cube nanohybrid (CPZC) with a ternary hierarchical architecture, which contains a fibrous carbon skeleton, highly porous carbon cube filler, and abundant CNT tentacles as an advanced matrix for sulfur electrodes. The as-developed CPZC delivers excellent conductivity, abundant active interfaces, and strong confinement to polysulfide, and thus is capable of significantly expediting the sulfur redox kinetics and promoting battery durability. The fabricated sulfur electrode achieves a superb rate capability up to 10C, outstanding cyclability over 2000 cycles, and more importantly, excellent performance under high a sulfur loading and sparing electrolyte with a high energy density of 348.8 W h kg(-1) and 327.6 W h L-1 at the system level, which reveals its potential in promoting the practical application of Li-S batteries.

In this study, we propose a novel two-dimensional conductive metal-organic framework, namely, Cu-benzenehexathial (BHT), as a promising sulfur host material for high-performance Li-S batteries. The conductivity of Cu-BHT eliminates the insulating nature of most S-based electrodes. The dissolution of LiPSs into the electrolyte is largely prevented by the strong interaction between Cu-BHT and LiPSs. In addition, orientated deposition of Li2S on Cu-BHT facilitates the kinetics of the LiPS redox reaction. Therefore, the use of Cu-BHT for Li-S battery cathodes is expected to suppress the LiPS shuttle effect and to improve the overall performance, which is ideal for practical application of Li-S batteries.

However, the limited sulfur content of similar to 40 wt% in the composite hinders its practical applications owing to insufficient areal/volumetric energy density, especially when used as flexible cathodes for wearable energy storage devices. Here, we report an ultrathin and condensed SPAN film synthesized via the in situ growth of ZIF-67 on electrospun fibers composed of PAN and CNTs, followed by a vulcanization process to generate surface-anchored CoS2 that effectively suppresses fiber swelling and film thickening. Simultaneously, conductive CoS2 helps expedite the redox kinetics of sulfur conversion for achieving high-performance Li-S cells with much improved areal capacity. This study refreshes current performance of SPAN cells with an ultrahigh initial areal capacity of 8.1 mA h cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of up to 5.9 mg cm(-2), as well as a superior capacity of 1322 mA h g(-1) in the prototype pouch cell, demonstrating great prospects of the employed protocol for realizing flexible Li-S batteries with high energy density.

Herein, we report the synthesis of nitrogen-containing mesoporous carbon with high SSA (1390m(2)g(-1)), a suitable pore size distribution (1.5-8.1nm), and a nitrogen content of 4.7wt% through a facile one-step self-assembly process. Owing to its unique physical characteristics and nitrogen doping, this material demonstrates great promise for application in both supercapacitors and encapsulating sulfur as a superior cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. When deployed as a supercapacitor electrode, it exhibited a high specific capacitance of 238.4Fg(-1) at 1Ag(-1) and an excellent rate capability (180Fg(-1), 10Ag(-1)). Furthermore, when an NMC/S electrode was evaluated as the cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, it showed a high initial discharge capacity of 1143.6mAhg(-1) at 837.5mAg(-1) and an extraordinary cycling stability with 70.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles.

The material is prepared via simple mixing of gold with molten sulfur at 120 degrees C, quenching at room temperature, and grinding. Our comprehensive study reports relevant electrochemical data, advanced X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging of the positive and negative electrodes, and a thorough structural and morphological characterization of the S:Au 97:3 w/w composite. This cathode exhibits high rate capability within the range from C/10 to 1C, a maximum capacity above 1300 mAh g(S)(-1), and capacity retention between 85% and 91% after 100 cycles at 1C and C/3 rates. The novel formulation enables a sulfur fraction in the composite cathode film as high as 78 wt%, an active material loading of 5.7 mg cm(-2), and an electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 5 mu L mg(-1), which lead to a maximum areal capacity of 5.4 mAh cm(-2). X-ray CT at the micro- and nanoscale reveals the microstructural features of the positive electrode that favor fast conversion kinetics in the battery. Quantitative analysis of sulfur distribution in the porous cathode displays that electrodeposition during the initial cycle may trigger an activation process in the cell leading to improved performance. Furthermore, the tomography study reveals the characteristics of the lithium anode and the cell separator upon a galvanostatic test prolonged over 300 cycles at a 2C rate.

The abundant nanopores and large surface area of aPG can provide an intimate contact and strong interaction with S species. Furthermore, the conductive PEDOT-PSS layer can facilitate the charge transportation and prevent the dissolution of polysulfides. As a result, the as-prepared PEDOT/S@aPG composite cathode with a sulfur content of about 60.1% shows a higher specific discharge capacity (1198 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C) in the first cycle and good cycling stability, retaining a reversible capacity of 845 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. Moreover, the PEDOT/S@aPG cathode also exhibits excellent rate capability, showing a high reversible capacity of 718 mA h g(-1) at 2 C.

To address these drawbacks, herein, we design and construct a heterostructured Ni/Ni-2 P embedded in a mesoporous carbon nanosphere composite (Ni/Ni2 P-MCN) for boosting polysulfide catalytic conversion in Li-S batteries. The Ni/Ni-2 P-MCN-modified separator could not only prevent the shuttle effect significantly through abundant chemical adsorptive sites, but also demonstrate superior catalytic reactivities for the conversion of polysulfides. More importantly, the conductive carbon matrix with an exposed mesoporous structure can serve as an effective physical barrier to accommodate deposited insoluble Li2S. Consequently, the cells with the Ni/Ni2 P-MCN-modified separator exhibit greatly boosted rate capability (431 mA h g(-1) at 5 C) and cycling stability (a capacity decay of 0.031% per cycle after 1500 cycles). Even at an enhanced sulfur loading of 4.2 mg cm(-2), a stable and superior areal capacity (about 3.5 mA h cm(-2)) has been demonstrated. We envision that the unique Ni/Ni2P heterostructure in the porous carbon matrix could offer great potential for high-performance and sustained energy storage devices.

J	Qin, W; Lu, ST; Wang, ZD; Wu, XH				Qin, Wei; Lu, Songtao; Wang, Zhida; Wu, Xiaohong			Edge-functionalized acetylene black anchoring sulfur for high-performance Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Sulfur cathode; Lithium-sulfur batteries; Acetylene black; Edge-functionalized; High-energy ball-milling	RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM; CATHODE MATERIAL; CYCLE PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE CATHODE; HIGH-CAPACITY; CARBON; NANOSHEETS; NITROGEN; INTERLAYER; STABILITY	To date, most of the research on electrodes for lithium sulfur batteries has been focused on the nanostructured sulfur cathodes and achieves significant success. However, from the viewpoint of manufacturers, the nanostructured sulfur cathodes are not so promising, because of the low volumetric energy density and high cost. In this work, we obtained the low-cost, scalable, eco-friendly mass production of edge-functionalized acetylene black-sulfur (FAB-S) composites by high-energy ball-milling technique for lithium sulfur batteries. The as-prepared FAB-S composite can deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1304 mAh/g and still remain a reversible capacity of 814 mAh/g after 200 cycles at a charge-discharge rate of 0.2 C in the voltage range of 1.7-2.7 V. The observed excellent electrochemical properties demonstrate that the cathodes obtained by the facile high-energy ball-milling method as the cathode for rechargeable Li -S batteries are of great potential because it used the sole conductive additive acetylene black (AB). Such improved properties could be attributed to the partially exfoliation of AB, which not only keeps the AB's inherent advantage, but also increases the specific surface area and forms chemical bonds between carbon and sulfur, resulting in the accumulation of the polysulfides intermediate through both the physical and chemical routes.

Here, it is demonstrated that the nickel-cobalt double hydroxide (NiCo-DH) shells that encapsulate sulfur nanoparticles can play multiple roles in suppressing the shuttle effect and accelerating the redox kinetics of LiPSs by combining with graphene and carbon nanotubes to construct the conductive networks. The NiCo-DH shell that intimately contacts with sulfur physically confines the loss of sulfur and promotes the charge transfer and ion diffusion. More importantly, it can react with LiPSs to produce the surface-bound intermediates, which are able to anchor the soluble LiPSs and accelerate the redox kinetics. Such composite electrodes can load high contents of sulfur (>85 wt%) and the resulting Li-S battery exhibits a superior capacity (1348.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), ultrahigh rate performance (697.7 mAh g(-1) at 5 C), and ultralong cycle life (1500 cycles) with a decay rate of 0.015% per cycle.

The resulting OMPPy possesses a large BET surface area (270.9 m(2)g(-1)), 3D interconnected large mesopores (approximate to 32 nm), and small mesopores (2-4 nm) on the large mesopore walls. The OMPPy is then applied as a host to form a kind of sulfur/OMPPy (S/OMPPy) composite cathode through a solution method followed by a heat-treatment process. Electrochemical test results show that the developed S/OMPPy cathode containing 51.1 wt% sulfur is able to deliver a high and stable specific discharge capacity of 908 mAhg(-1) at 0.1C after 100 cycles. At higher discharge rates of 1C, the S/OMPPy exhibits a discharge capacity of 673.7 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles and 462.2 mAhg(-1) after 300 cycles. The exceptional electrochemical performance of the S/OMPPy is attributed to the large surface area and the commendable pore size distribution of OMPPy for trapping polysulfides as well as the ordered large mesopores for excellent electrolyte accessibility and fast Li-ion transport.

In the S/C/PAN nanofibers, the sulfurized PAN matrix acts not only as ionic and electronic channels to allow Li+ and electrons to arrive at and react with the S/C nanoparticles, but also as a protective barrier to prevent the S/C nanoparticles from contacting the electrolyte, thus avoiding the discharge intermediates of sulfur to dissolve in and react with the organic carbonate electrolyte. Since the redox reaction of sulfur in the nanofibers occurs mostly at the interior S/C interface through a solid state reaction mechanism, the microstructures and electrochemical interfaces in the nanofiber cathode remain stable during repeated cycles. As a consequence, the S/C/PAN cathode demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 1179 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 200 mA g(-1), a high Coulombic efficiency of similar to 100% after a few cycles, a good rate capability with 616 mA h g(-1) at 4.0 A g(-1) and a long cycling stability with 60% capacity retention over 400 cycles, showing great prospect for Li-S battery applications.

By combining MOFs with graphene, which possesses high conductivity and a large specific surface area, the next generation of electrochemical energy storage applications will realize new breakthroughs. In this review, we summarize a wide range of applications for MOF-graphene composite materials in lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and supercapacitors. Finally, based on the scientific knowledge and experimental evidence reported in the existing literature, some breakthrough directions for MOF-graphene composite materials have been proposed.

An optimized amount of NiS2 (approximate to 18 wt%) with porous nanoflower-like morphology is uniformly in situ grown on the RGO substrate, providing abundant active sites to adsorb and localize polysulfides. The improved polysulfide adsorptivity from sulfiphilic NiS2 is confirmed by experimental data and first-principle calculations. Moreover, due to the chemical coupling between NiS2 and RGO formed during the in situ synthesis, the conductive RGO substrate offers a 3D electron pathway to facilitate charge transfer toward the NiS2-polysulfide adsorption interface, triggering a fast redox kinetics of polysulfide conversion and excellent rate performance (C/20-4C). Therefore, the self-assembled hybrid structure simultaneously promotes static polysulfide-trapping capability and dynamic polysulfide-conversion reversibility. As a result, the 3D porous sponge enables a high sulfur content (75 wt%) and a remarkably high sulfur loading (up to 21 mg cm(-2)) and areal capacity (up to 16 mAh cm(-2)), exceeding most of the reported values in the literature involving either RGO or metal sulfides/other metal compounds (sulfur content of <60 wt% and sulfur loading of <3 mg cm(-2)).

However, LSBs undergo extreme electrochemical and physical changes in S during charge cycling, which limit battery performance. Here, we design a multifunctional polymer binder based on robust conductive webs comprising ring-opened poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) connected with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). By forming an intermolecular structure in the simultaneous reduction of GO and ring-opening of PVP, the PVP-rGO web provides high affinity to Li polysulfides, mechanical robustness, and facile electron transfer, which can overcome the performance issues of LSBs. The prepared Li-S cell with the PVP-rGO web as binder presents the remarkable specific capacity of 374 mAh g(-1) at 7 C and stable cycling performance with low capacity decay per cycle over 500 cycles at both 1 and 5 C.

Herein, we synthesized acidified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (AMWCNT)/NiCo2O4@S as an efficient cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries. The AMWCNT skeleton can be used as an electron conductivity enhancer and physico-chemical adsorption sites for polysulfides, and the hollow structured NiCo2O4 spheres can not only accommodate the volume change during cycling, but also accelerate the redox kinetics and suppress the shuttle effect. Thus, the AMWCNT/NiCo2O4@S cathode delivers an initial capacity of 958.8 mAh.g(-1) at 0.5 C, and the capacity remains 700.3 mAh.g(-1) with a low capacity decay rate of 0.090% per cycle after 300 cycles. The unique structure design provides a potential host material for the high-capacity and -stability lithium-sulfur batteries. [GRAPHICS] .

However, the application of Li-S batteries has been hindered by the rapid capacity fading due to the "shuttle effect". Here, we demonstrate that polar NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, acting as protective hosts of polysulfides for the cathode, have a strong chemical interaction with sulfur species. The NiFe LDH hosts can effectively restrict the dissolution of polysulfides and enhance the reaction kinetics of lithium polysulfide redox reactions through the electrocatalytic effect. As a result, the NiFe LDHs/S electrode exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance with a high initial discharge capacity of 1633.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and a stable cycle performance with a capacity decay of 0.024% per cycle at 2C.

While the sulfur-based redox reactions are reasonably well understood, the knowledge of deleterious side reactions in lithium-sulfur batteries is still limited. In particular, the gassing behavior has not yet been investigated, although it is known that lithium metal readily reacts with the commonly used ethereal electrolytes. Herein, we describe, for the first time, gas evolution in operating lithium-sulfur cells with a diglyme-based electrolyte and evaluate the effect of the polysulfide shuttle-suppressing additive LiNO3. The use of the combination of two operando techniques (pressure measurements and online continuous flow differential electrochemical mass spectrometry coupled with infrared spectroscopy) demonstrates that the additive dramatically reduces, but does not completely eliminate gassing. The major increase in pressure occurs during charge, immediately after fresh lithium is deposited, but there are differences in gas generation during cycling depending on the addition of LiNO3. Cells with LiNO3 show evolution of N-2 and N2O in addition to CH4 and H-2, the latter being the main volatile decomposition products. Collectively, these results provide novel insight into the important function of LiNO3 as a stabilizing additive in lithium-sulfur batteries.

To address these issues, a sandwich composite of hollow porous carbon spheres (HPCSs) and conductive delaminated-MXene nanosheets (d-Ti3C2) is designed by an electrostatic self-assembly approach as the sulfur hosts (denoted as HPCSs@d-Ti3C2). The hollow and porous merits of HPCSs can provide sufficient space for sulfur loading, while the conductive and polar MXene can chemisorb or bond polysulfides to inhibit the shuttle effect. Optimized packing of zero-dimensional (0D) HPCSs on 2D MXene nanosheets can not only accommodate volume expansion during polysulfide adsorption and conversion, but also prevent the aggregation of HPCSs to extend the lifetime of Li-S batteries. Consequently, the HPCSs@d-Ti3C2/S cathode with a high sulfur content of 76.5% has a strong physical and chemical co-adsorbing and/or chemical bonding with polysulfides to suppress the shuttle effect, and thus delivers satisfied sulfur utilization, rate capacities and cycling stability (only a capacity decay ratio of 0.069% per cycle on average). Such proposed design based on synergistic effects via nanoengineering is expected to be applicable to a large amount of MXene derived materials for various energy storage devices.

However, the particularly rapid capacity reduction owing to the dissolution of intermediate polysulfide anions into the electrolyte still hinders practical application. In this respect, we report a novel core-shell structured sulfur-poly(sodium p-styrenesulfonate) (S@PSS) composite cathode material with a sulfur content as high as 93 wt% for lithium-sulfur batteries, which is the highest sulfur content disclosed in the literature. Due to the effective transport of lithium cations while blocking polysulfide anions by common ion Coulombic repulsion of the negatively charged -SO3- groups in the PSS protective layer, the S@PSS composite cathode exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 1159 mA h g(-1) at a 0.1 C rate, and retains a stable discharge capacity of 972 mA h g(-1) after 70 cycles and 845 mA h g(-1) after 120 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of over 99%. To our knowledge, this new methodology for lithium-sulfur cathodes has not been reported so far; the initial specific capacity is the highest value calculated based on total composite mass, which has not been disclosed in the literature.

The cell, using a sulfur-free, Super P carbon electrode shows a capacity varying from 430 mAh g(-1) s to 700 mAh g(-1)s. The cycling tests show that the stability of the cell is strongly affected by the voltage cutoff directly controlling the electrochemical process, in particular the polysulfide shuttle reaction. In this respect, XPS measurement shows the deposition of Li2S2 salt at the lithium electrode surface as the cell voltage cutoff is enlarged, thus suggesting that the use of the reduced voltage and capacity regimes may lead to higher stability. Under the best control regime, the 2 V cell delivers a capacity of 530 mAh g(-1)s, with extremely low polarization and cycling stability extended up to 100 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that enhanced performances may be effectively reached by adding LiNO3 salt to the electrolyte solution to form a stable, protective SEI film on the lithium surface, thus avoiding the shuttle process and increasing the cell efficiency, even under a full voltage cutoff range, i.e. extending from 1 V to 3 V.

The solubility of the precursor in polar solvents combined with a common polymer (PVP) allowed a suitable spinning solution to obtain ideal green Li2S loaded fibers. 3D fiber mats of the calcined homogeneous 1D electrospun Li2S/C fibers were characterized by electron microscopy and X-ray powder diffraction analysis. Direct integration of Li2S in an electronically conductive carbon matrix as the cathode obviates the need of elemental lithium as the anode, which is a great advantage against the reported lithium-sulfur batteries. An initial capacity of about 870 mA h g(-1) at C/20, a capacity retention of 73% after 100 cycles at C/10 and a capacity of about 400 mA h g(-1) at 1C were observed for the presented system.

The host in this unique architecture is porous carbon, which contains interconnected macropore tunnels and meso/micropores on the macropore tunnel walls. These hierarchical pores exhibit a synergistic effect to adsorb sulfur in their spaces and provide more nucleation sites to direct the uniform coating of sulfur. Moreover, the interconnected porous structure can facilitate electron transfer and also ensure high sulfur utilization. Furthermore, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) layer container improves the conductivity of the electrode, prevents the diffusion of dissolved polysulfide, and prevents volume expansion during the charge-discharge processes. As a result, the electrode with the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/sulfur/porous carbon composite and Host-Sulfur-Container architecture maintains a reversible capacity of 831.9 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5 C and presents long-term cycling stability with 0.088% capacity decay per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C. This indicates that the prepared Host-Sulfur-Container composite is a promising cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, and its hierarchical tunnel pore carbon host with meso/micropores inside shows great potential in the energy storage field.

J	Park, H; Siegel, DJ				Park, Haesun; Siegel, Donald J.			Tuning the Adsorption of Polysulfides in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with Metal-Organic Frameworks	CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE OXIDE; LONG-LIFE; COORDINATION POLYMER; HYDROGEN STORAGE; METHANE STORAGE; HIGH-CAPACITY; CATHODE; DENSITY	The dissolution of polysulfide (PS) intermediates during discharge is a well-known obstacle to achieving long cycle life in lithium sulfur batteries. Prior work has shown that PS dissolution can be partially suppressed via physical encapsulation of sulfur and PS within a porous cathode support. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, nanoporous materials with extremely high surface areas, whose structure and composition can be varied extensively. MOFs are promising cathode support materials because the encapsulation afforded by MOF pores can be augmented by chemical adsorption of PS onto coordinately unsaturated metal sites (CUS). Here, we demonstrate that this additive approach-restricting PS dissolution by combining encapsulation and adsorption within a MOF can be tuned to maximize PS anchoring via metal substitution on the CUS. Optimal MOF compositions are pinpointed by computationally screening 16 metal-substituted variants of M-2(dobdc) (MOF-74) for their ability to chemically anchor prototypical species (S-8, Li2S4, and Li2S) present during the cycling of Li-S batteries. Ti-2, Ni-2, and Mo-2(dobdc) are identified as the compositions with the largest affinities for Li2S4 and Li2S. As Ni-2(dobdc) has been synthesized previously, this MOF is proposed as a promising cathode support for Li-S batteries.

Potential candidates include lithium sulfur batteries based on a lithium sulfide (Li2S) cathode material, which overcome many of the problems associated with other lithium sulfur battery designs. The downside of this is that Li2S has a sluggish activation process, and so, in a bid to overcome this shortcoming, various studies have aimed at better understanding the activation mechanism of this material so that it can be more effectively utilized. An overview of these efforts, as well as of the various full-cell systems that have been subsequently developed based on Li2S cathodes in combination with different anode materials such as silicon nanowires, silicon thin films, and tin composites is provided.

Herein, an integrated design of hollow carbon nanospheres filled by polar manganese oxide (delta-MnO2) nanoflakes (MnO2@HCS) as a sulfur host is proposed, in which the physical confinement and chemical interaction for LiPSs are successfully achieved simultaneously. In this architecture, the outer porous carbon shell can support the fast electron/ion transfer and serve as a physical barrier to confine the soluble LiPSs. Besides, the hollow architecture can accommodate the active sulfur and buffer its volume variation during cycling. Moreover, the inner polar MnO2 nanoflakes can trap and boost the redox reactions of LiPSs through thiosulfate-polythionate conversion leading to inhibited shuttle effect. Due to the unique synergistic encapsulations, the MnO2@HCS-S cathode achieves a high initial specific discharge capacity of 1250 mAh g(-1), and exhibits a stable cyclic property maintaining 705 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0C corresponding to an ultralow capacity decay of 0.078% per cycle. As a result, this proposed strategy will guide a new direction for the development of polar metal compounds with special architectures for advanced Li-S batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, dual-heterostructure decorated interweaved carbon nanofibers are proposed as sulfur hosts to significantly improve the energy storage behavior of LSBs. The unique structure of the interweaved carbon nanofibers and heterostructures provides more transmission channels for electrons and ions while also accelerating the process. Moreover, the heterostructures induce chemical anchoring and catalytic conversion of LiPSs. As a result, the cathode in the coin cell delivers an initial capacity of 777.9 mAh g-1 at 1C and high retention of 68.59% after 600 cycles. In the pouch cell, the cathode delivers a discharge capacity of 907.8 mAh g-1 and a reversible charging capacity of 913.1 mAh g-1 for the first cycle with an ultra-high sulfur loading up to 9.136 mg cm-2. Beyond that, density functional theory calculations, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, symmetric cell, and Li2S nucleation tests were adopted to verify the adsorption and catalytic conversion mechanisms of the cathode. This excellent interweaved dualheterostructure sulfur host provides a novel structural design strategy for efficient chemical adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs, as well as more opportunities for the commercial application of LSBs.

Efficient conversion of lithium polysulfides to lithium sulfide (during discharge) and to sulfur (during recharge) is a performance-determining factor for lithium-sulfur batteries. Here we show that MoS2-x/reduced graphene oxide (MoS2-x/rGO) can be used to catalyze the polysulfide reactions to improve the battery performance. It was confirmed, through microstructural characterization of the materials, that sulfur deficiencies on the surface participated in the polysulfide reactions and significantly enhanced the polysulfide conversion kinetics. The fast conversion of soluble polysulfides decreased their accumulation in the sulfur cathode and their loss from the cathode by diffusion. Hence in the presence of a small amount of MoS2-x/rGO (4 wt% of the cathode mass), high rate (8C) performance of the sulfur cathode was improved from a capacity of 161.1 mA h g(-1) to 826.5 mA h g(-1). In addition, MoS2-x/rGO also enhanced the cycle stability of the sulfur cathode from a capacity fade rate of 0.373% per cycle (over 150 cycles) to 0.083% per cycle (over 600 cycles) at a typical 0.5C rate. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the catalytic role of MoS2-x/rGO in promoting the polysulfide conversion kinetics in the sulfur cathode.

Sulfur Vapor-Infiltrated 3D Carbon Nanotube Foam for Binder-Free High Areal Capacity Lithium-Sulfur Battery Composite Cathodes	ACS NANO			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; high areal capacity; high areal loading; cathode; carbon nanotubes; capillary force; high-energy density	LI-S BATTERIES; RECHARGEABLE BATTERY; PERFORMANCE; NANOMATERIALS; INTERLAYER; ELECTRODE; FILM	Here, we demonstrate a strategy to produce high areal loading and areal capacity sulfur cathodes by using vapor phase infiltration of low-density carbon nanotube (CNT) foams preformed by solution processing and freeze-drying. Vapor-phase capillary infiltration of sulfur into preformed and binder-free low density CNT foams leads to a mass loading of, similar to 79 wt % arising from interior filling and coating of CNTs with sulfur while preserving conductive CNT CNT junctions that sustain electrical accessibility through the thick foam. Sulfur cathodes are then produced by mechanically compressing these foams into dense composites (rho > 0.2 g/cm(3)), revealing specific capacity of 1039 mAh/gs at 0.1 C, high sulfur areal loading of 19.1 mg/cm(2), and high areal capacity of 19.3 mAh/cm(2). This work highlights a technique broadly adaptable to a diverse group of nanostructured building blocks where preformed low-density materials can be vapor infiltrated with sulfur, mechanically compressed, and exhibit simultaneous high areal and gravimetric storage properties. This provides a route for scalable, low-cost, and high-energy density sulfur cathodes based on conventional solid electrode processing routes.

In this work, a multistage porous composite with three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) CoSn alloy and embedded microporous Co decorated N-doped carbon (Co-NC) is rationally designed. The conductive CoSn alloy skeleton exhibits strong polar adsorption and effective catalytic activity towards polysulfide conversion, as well as fast electron transportation. Meanwhile, the 3DOM structure possesses sufficient volume space for ion migration and sulfur expansion. Additionally, the properly embedded Co-NC derived from ZIF-67 can offer abundant micropores and catalytic sites, promoting polysulfide trapping and LiPS conversion kinetics. Accordingly, the Li-S batteries fabricated with 3DOM Co-NC@CoSn exhibit remarkable stability with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.046% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C. An impressive areal capacity of about 5.1 mAh cm(-2) under high sulfur loading of 6.8 mg cm(-2) is also achieved at 0.2 C, with a high capacity retention of 79% over 100 cycles. The pouch cell maintains stable at 0.05 C, and the capacity decay is only 0.29% per cycle. This design and synthesis strategy of cathodes has great prospects in the practical application of Li-S battery.& nbsp;(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accelerating sulfur redox reactions is considered a promising way toward the capture and utilization of soluble sulfur species. Herein, topological insulator (TI) Bi2Te3 is reported as an electrocatalyst for accelerated sulfur electrochemistry. The findings indicate that Bi2Te3 can effectively anchor soluble sulfur species and form seamless electron transport pathways with the adsorbed polysulfides. Both the sulfur reduction reactions and the reverse processes are found to be boosted by Bi2Te3. The incorporation of Bi2Te3 enables efficient operation of Li-S batteries in terms of impressive rate capability of 857 mAh g(-1) at 3 C and very low capacity decay of 0.033% per cycle over 1000 cycles. This work extends the application of TI to the field of Li-S electrochemistry and may inspire further explorations.

The mesopores in the MPCN are beneficial for the infiltration of electrolyte and the transportation of Li ions, and the micropores are sufficient to encapsulate sulfur and adsorb the soluble polysulfides. The MPCN-S cathode displays a discharge capacity of about 1000 mA h g(-1) at the current rate of 0.5C and retains 740 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles with the coulombic efficiency up to 95%. Moreover, it still has a discharge capacity as high as 850 mA h g(-1) when the current rate increased to 2C, which demonstrates a nice rate capability.

In recently, many efforts have been made to improve the electrochemical performance of cathode materials for Li-S batteries. In the present investigation, MgO-doped and nitrogen-rich carbon nanofibers have been prepared via electrospinning technology under carbonization treatment. Ultrathin ZnO nanolayer is further coated on the surface of the carbon nanofiber by atomic layer deposition and then sulfur is loaded inside the nanofibers to achieve a C-MgO/S@ZnO composite. This composite was used as cathode material in Li-S batteries. They are exhibited maximum rate capabilities of 1066.08 and 846.75 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 and 2 C, respectively. Moreover, the discharge capacity is 812.67 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 2 C and the capacity decay after 100 cycles is as small as 0.04% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance of C-MgO/S@ZnO nanofibers could be ascribed by the rational design due to the structure and composition of sulfur host.

The ability to engineer the porosity, wall thickness, and graphitization degree of the carbon host is essential for addressing issues that hamper commercialization of Li-S batteries, such as fast capacity decay and poor high-rate performance. In this work, highly ordered, ultrathin mesoporous graphitic-carbon frameworks (MGFs) having unique cage-like mesoporosity, derived from self-assembled Fe3O4 nanoparticle superlattices, are demonstrated to be an excellent host for encapsulating sulfur. The resulting S@MGFs exhibit high specific capacity (1,446 mAh.g(-1) at 0.15 C), good rate capability (430 mAh.g(-1) at 6 C), and exceptional cycling stability (similar to 0.049% capacity decay per cycle at 1 C) when used as Li-S cathodes. The superior electrochemical performance of the S@MGFs is attributed to the many unique and advantageous structural features of MGFs. In addition to the interconnected, ultrathin graphitic-carbon framework that ensures rapid electron and lithium-ion transport, the microporous openings between adjacent mesopores efficiently suppress the diffusion of polysulfides, leading to improved capacity retention even at high current densities.

The ultrathin ZrB2/graphene oxide/carboxymethocel (ZrB2/GO/CMC) layer coated onto cathode via simple doctor blade method has been developed as the effective polysulfide shuttling barrier. Owing to typical 2D scaffold and abundant functional oxygen groups , the GO can provide physical defender as well as chemical trap against polysulfide shuttling. The introduction of conductive ZrB2 nanoparticles in the hybrid layer can not only improve the conductivity of hybrid layer dramatically reducing electrochemical polarization of Li-S battery without adding other conductive agent but also further form chemical shield by chemisorption which is firstly confirmed by experimental and theoretical calculations. Combining these merits, the ultrathin ZrB2/GO/CMC hybrid layer combining with CNT@S hybrid cathode enables the Li-S battery to achieve good rate performance (769 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 2 C) and stable cycling capability (with a low capacity decay rate of 0.098% during 300 cycles at 1 C). Specifically, the Li-S battery shows the potential of practical application, with high areal S loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2), delivering the capacity near-commercial lithium-ion battery.

Herein, a rationally modified polypropylene (PP) separator with multi-functional nickel hydroxide@carbon nanotube (NiOOH@CNT) coating layer is proposed to overcome these critical obstacles. The conductive and porous CNT networks ensure the rapid electron/ion transport to achieve high reactivation and reutilization of active materials, as well as physically block the polysulfide migration. Meanwhile, the porous NiOOH nanowalls arrays layer with polar surface demonstrates superior chemical absorption ability for anchoring polysulfides, thereby significantly suppressing the shuttle effect. Such elaborately designed separator endows Li-S batteries with high specific capacity, superior capacity retention and remarkable rate capability. This work sheds new light on the multi-functional separators for high-performance Li-S batteries.

To address this issue, in situ topochemical oxidation derivative TiC@carbon-included TiO2 (TiC@C-TiO2) core-shell composite is designed and proposed as a multifunctional sulfur host, which integrates the merits of conductive TiC core to facilitate the redox reaction kinetics of sulfur species, and porous C-TiO2 shell to suppress the dissolution and shuttling of LiPSs through chemisorption. A unique dual chemical mediation mechanism is demonstrated for the proposed TiC@C-TiO2 composite that synergistically entraps LiPSs through thiosulfate/polythionate conversion coupled with strong polar-polar interaction. The morphological characterization reveals that the TiC@C-TiO2-based cathode can well regulate the distribution of electrode materials to retard their accumulation inside the electrode, ensuring effective contact between the active materials and electrolyte. Based on its unique function and structure, the cathode delivers an improved capacity of 1256 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, a remarkable rate capability of 643 mAh g(-1), and an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.065% per cycle at 2C over 900 cycles. This work not only demonstrates a dual chemical mediation mechanism to immobilize LiPSs, but also provides a universal strategy to construct multifunctional sulfur hosts for advanced Li-S batteries.

Surface morphology and structure of this composite are characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, X-ray power diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The first discharge capacity of the sample containing 10 wt.% SnS2 exhibits a high special capacity value of about 1237.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C, and after 200 cycles retains 924 mAh g(-1). Tin sulfide particles play a favorable role on adsorption towards polysulfides which would influence electrochemical process. This strategy of immobilization of sulfur with small amount of metal sulfide particles anchored in AHCNS provides a considerable approach to elevate the sulfur loading, coulombic efficiency, and cycling stability for Li-S batteries.

In this work, a novel bifunctional and free-standing sulfur cathode consisted of a hierarchical porous carbon network as the conductive host for sulfur and an in situ formed graphene shell as the top layer for physical blocking of the shuttle effect is carefully fabricated. Owing to filtration assembly, an ultrathin graphene shell (similar to 100 nm in thickness) is in situ formed firstly, on which a macroporous graphene architecture is gradually deposited afterwards. Subsequent chemical vapor deposition of interwoven CNTs on both sides of graphene sheets generates numerous nano-sized cavities for loading of sulfur nanoparticles. The rationally designed electrode possesses a relatively high areal sulfur loading of similar to 3.6 mg cm(-2), and shows excellent rate capability at similar to 6.0 mA cm(-2) and cyclic stability over 200 cycles. And as the graphene nano-shell blocks the diffusion of polysulfides, the anti-self-discharge capability of the cell is remarkably improved.

Herein, a nitrogen doped porous carbon polyhedron coupled with a well distributed alpha-CoS/Co heterostructure mediator was designed and prepared as the sulfur cathode host for lithium sulfur batteries. The alpha-CoS/Co heterostructure on a nitrogen doped carbon polyhedron (NCP) not only provides a strong adsorption interaction towards soluble polysulfides, but more importantly, also promotes the fast conversion of polysulfides to insoluble products, chemically suppressing the shuttling of polysulfides through the simultaneous advantages of alpha-CoS and Co. As a result, the alpha-CoS/Co-NCP-S cathode exhibits high sulfur utilization with a 1611.4 mA h g(-1) first discharge capacity and a well satisfactory redox cycling stability with a low capacity fade rate of 0.042% per cycle at 0.5 C for over 800 cycles. Moreover, the hybrid cathode delivers 860.2 mA h g(-1) specific capacity for a high sulfur loading of 4.8 mg cm(-2) with remarkable cycling performance.

Yolk-Shell Structure of Polyaniline-Coated Sulfur for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CATHODE MATERIAL; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; NANOSTRUCTURED MATERIALS; ENERGY-CONVERSION; CARBON NANOTUBES; HIGH-CAPACITY; CYCLE-LIFE; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; STORAGE	Lithium-sulfur batteries have attracted much attention in recent years due to their high theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g(-1) and low cost. However, a rapid capacity fade is normally observed, attributed mainly to polysulfide dissolution and volume expansion. Although many strategies have been reported to prolong the cyclability, the high cost and complex preparation processes still hinder their practical application. Here, we report the synthesis of a polyaniline-sulfur yolk-shell nanocomposite through a heating vulcanization of a polyaniline-sulfur core-shell structure. We observed that this heating treatment was much more effective than chemical leaching to prepare uniform yolk-shell structures. Compared with its sulfur-polyaniline core-shell counterparts, the yolk-shell nanostructures delivered much improved cyclability owing to the presence of internal void space inside the polymer shell to accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur during lithiation. The yolk-shell material exhibited a stable capacity of 765 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 200 cycles, representing a promising future for industrial scale Li-S batteries.

Although tremendous efforts have been made, heat tolerance capability of Li-S batteries is a topic rarely touched, although it is essential for practical application. At high temperatures, the dissolution of the polysulfides is aggravated, and the safety issue becomes severe. Herein, by using sulfur/polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) composites as positive electrode materials and a gel polymer membrane with carbonate electrolyte, we successfully realized a Li-S battery with remarkable heat-resistant performance at 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C. The SPAN-positive materials allow the Li-S battery operated in safer carbonate-containing electrolyte. The gel polymer electrolyte enhances the charge transfer, maintains the morphology of Li metal during cycling, and suppresses the migration of the soluble polysulfides, which is also observed when SPAN is used as positive electrode material.

Due to its uniform three-dimensional connected structure, its reasonable composition with N doping and its high electronic conductivity, the NCF can function as both a three-dimensional current collector and a carbon interlayer for lithium sulfur batteries. As a typical model, cathodes consisting of NCF and CNT/S were prepared. The resulting batteries deliver a large reversible capacity of 1124 mA h g(-1). at 0.5C and retain a high specific capacity of 902.8 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.6% throughout the cycles. Furthermore, a discharge capacity of 691.8 mA h g(-1) is still attainable when the rate is increased to 2.0C. The excellent cycling performance and rate capability are contributed to the uniform flexible elastic, conductive 3D framework and good porosity, and may have great significance for large-scale commercial applications of Li-S batteries.

However, the homogenization of sulfur, carbon, and solid electrolyte is a challenge to achieving high-performance cathodes for ASLBs. Herein, we demonstrate a promising sulfur-carbon composite with high sulfur content (71.4-83.3%) prepared using a sulfur vapor deposition (SVD) approach to show enhanced discharge specific capacities, rate performance, and cycling stability, outperforming conventional sulfur liquid deposition (SLD) and sulfur solid deposition (SSD) approaches. A higher discharge specific sulfur capacity of 1792.6 mAh g(-1) has been achieved at 0.1 degrees C and 60 degrees C with improvement ascribed to smaller particle size and more homogeneous and deeply confined sulfur in sulfur-carbon composite, in contrast to 1619.2 and 1329.3 mAh g(-1) for samples prepared by conventional SLD and SSD approaches, respectively.

Li[TFSA] was dissolved into [DEME] [TESA] to prepare the electrolytes, and a molecular solvent tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) was used for Li[TESA] as a reference. Discharge-charge tests of Li-S cells using these electrolytes were carried out. The discharge-charge cycle stability and Coulombic efficiency of a cell with an RTIL electrolyte were found to be surprisingly superior to those of a cell with TEGDME electrolyte. The poor cycle stability of the cell with the TEGDME electrolyte was attributed to the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (Li2Sm), which were generated as reaction intermediates through a redox process at the S cathode in the Li-S cell. RTIL has low donor ability owing to the weak Lewis basicity of [TESA](-) anion, whereas conventional ether-based molecular solvents such as TEGDME have high donor ability. The dissolution of Li2Sm was significantly suppressed owing to the weak donor ability of RTIL. In the RTIL electrolyte, Li2Sm was immobilized on the electrode, and the electrochemical reaction of the S species occurred exdusively in the solid phase. These results clearly prove a novel solvent effect of RTILs on the electrochemical reactions of the S cathode in Li-S cells.

Cathodes made with such composites after infused with sulfur (CNF-RGO/S) were able to deliver an initial reversible capacity of 730mAh/g and 378mAh/g after 500cycles at 0.1C. Even at a high rate of 5C, the CNF-RGO/S experienced the capacity of 227mAh/g and no capacity fade after 400cycles. In contrast, the capacity of an electrode without adding RGO decayed dramatically. The CNF matrix provides stable mechanical stability and shortens diffusion paths. The addition of RGO sheets increase the contact area with the electrolyte and speed up the reaction rate. These results demonstrate that the 3D network structure is of great potential as the cathode for long-cycle and high-rate rechargeable Li-S batteries.

Herein, we proposed that two-dimensional heterostructures made of layered covalent triazine framework on Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets (CTF/TNS) as a sulfur host show multiple-in-one advantages for lithium-sulfur batteries. The integrity of organic CTF with ordered pore structure and inorganic TNSs with high conductivity imparts the heterostructures three-dimensional spatial confinement for high sulfur loading and efficient electron/ion transport for improved reaction kinetics. In addition, lithiophilic N sites in CTF and sulfurophilic Ti sites in TNSs enable dual-site chemical anchoring of polysulfides to effectively suppress shuttle effect. With a high sulfur loading of 76 wt%, the S@CTF/TNS cathode shows high reversible capacity (1441 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C), outstanding cycling stability (up to 1000 cycles at 1 C with a 0.014 % capacity decay rate per cycle) and excellent rate capability. Notably, even with a high areal sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm(-2), a high capacity retention of 94 % is still obtained after 100 cycles. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The as-synthesized product was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and determined to be a mixture of crystalline Li2S, amorphous Li2S2, and higher-order polysulfides (Li2Sx, x > 2). Monitored filtration followed by a tailored electrochemical approach was used to successfully remove the higher-order polysulfides and yielded a powder, which was determined by XPS to be comprised of similar to 9 mol% insoluble polysulfide species (mainly Li2S2) and similar to 91 mol% Li2S. This material was discharged galvanostatically in an electrochemical cell and, despite the lack of soluble polysulfide species, was shown to exhibit a discharge plateau at similar to 2.1 V vs. Li/Li+. This result confirmed the electrochemical reducibility of electrolyte-insoluble polysulfides in Li-S batteries. Moreover, it was determined that the reduction of solid polysulfides was confined to areas where the sulfur-sulfur bonds were in intimate contact with the conductive current collector. Finally, it was observed that commercially available Li2S samples contain significant quantities of polysulfide-type impurities. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.

After carbonization and template removal, the as-prepared PCBN5 composed of interconnected hollow carbon balls exhibit large surface area (447.4 m(2)/g) and large pore volume (1.567 cm(3)/g), high graphitization degree and robust framework. Serving as an efficient sulfur host, PCBNs supported sulfur cathode (S@PCBNs with sulfur content of 72 wt%) delivers a high discharge capacity of 760 mA h/g after 150 cycles at 0.1 C and 455 mA h/g after 400 cycles at 1 C. The superior lithium storage properties is attributed to the novel hierarchical microstructure of the PCBNs, in which the large hollow space not only allows high loading of sulfur but also efficiently accommodates the large volumetric expansion. Moreover, the interconnected PCBN5 with high conductivity can spatially confine the shuttling of soluble polysulfides and enhance the redox reaction kinetics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, nitrogen-doped carbon-coated cobalt nickel selenide (Co-NiSe2@NC) with hollow structures is presented which can simultaneously accommodate the volume expansion of sulfur to maintain the integrity of the electrode, trap the polysulfides, and catalyze the conversion between lithium sulfide and lithium polysulfides to inhibit the polysulfides shuttle. When used to host 70 wt% sulfur, the resulted Co-NiSe2@NC-S composites electrode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 930.4 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, and after 200 cycles, a reversible discharge capacity of 544.6 mAh g(-1) can still be maintained.

However, the undesirable shuttle effect with the solid discharge product, Li2S, greatly impedes their market penetration. Conductive carbon materials with functional elements are beneficial in controlling the shuttle effect and can reactivate the Li2S, leading to improved long term cycling performance of LSBs. Herein, we report zinc (Zn) and nitrogen (N) co-doped ZIF-8 derived hollow carbon (ZHC) as a promising separator coating for LSBs to control the shuttle effect. The hollow area in the ZHC is identified to be around 250 nm with a carbonized outer surface thickness of approximately 50 nm. The presence of Zn and N in the nanohollow carbon structure helps to mitigate polysulfide (PS) diffusion in LSBs. Furthermore, the hollow interior of the carbon acts as a PS pocket to physically capture the PS and in addition Zn and N chemically attract the PS through polar-polar and metal sulfide interactions. The ZHC with its unique architecture and functional groups shows a promising performance with an initial specific capacity (S.cap) of 842 mA h g(-1) at 4.80 mg cm(-2) and cycling stability until 400 cycles, which is considerably higher in comparison with the cycling performance of parent ZIF-8.

However, their practical applications are hindered by the low utilization of sulfur due to its poor electronic conductivity, the shuttle effect and the sluggish redox kinetics of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), thus resulting in severe fading capacity. In study, graphene decorated with hetero-Co9S8-NiS sheets (BMS-G) was employed as a host material to support S in cathodes. The hetero-Co9S8-NiS effectively confined numerous LiPS species by chemisorption, and expedited the redox kinetics of LiPS. Consequently, the cathode with the BMS-G composite delivered high reversible specific capacities of 1142.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and 705.8 mA h g(-1) at 2 C, and had an excellent cycling stability (only 0.031% capacity fading per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C was observed).

To address this issue, this work discloses a bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF) as a sulfur host material based on Al-MOF, commonly called (Al)MIL-53. To obtain a high-adsorption capacity to lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx, 4 <= x <= 8), we present an effective strategy to incorporate sulfiphilic metal ion (Cu2+) with high-binding energy to Li2Sx into the framework. Through a one-step hydrothermal method, Cu2+ is homogeneously dispersed in Al-MOF, producing a bimetallic Al/Cu-MOF as advanced cathode material. The macroscopic Li2S4 solution permeation test indicates that the Al/Cu-MOF has better adsorption capacity to lithium polysulfides than monometallic Al-MOF. The sulfur-transfusing process is executed via a melt-diffusion method to obtain the sulfur-containing Al/Cu-MOF (Al/Cu-MOF-S). The assembled Li-S batteries with Al/Cu-MOF-S yield improved cyclic performance, much better than that of monometallic Al-MOF as sulfur host. It is shown that chemical immobilization is an effective method for polysulfide adsorption than physical confinement and the bimetallic Al/Cu-MOF, formed by incorporation of sulfiphilic Cu2+ into porous MOF, will provide a novel and powerful approach for efficient sulfur host materials.

The electrode of the lithium-sulfur battery was manufactured as a freestanding flexible electrode using an economical and simple vacuum filtration method without a current collector and a binder. The porous NiO-added S/CNT/NiO electrode exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 877 mA h g(-1) (0.2 C), which was 125 mA h g(-1) higher than that of S/CNT, and also showed excellent retention of 84% (S/CNT: 66%). This is the result of suppressing the dissolution of lithium polysulfide into the electrolyte by the strong chemical bond between NiO and lithium polysulfide during the charging and discharging process. In addition, for the flexibility test of the S/CNT/NiO electrode, the 1.6 x 4 cm(2) pouch cell was prepared and exhibited stable cycle characteristics of 620 mA h g(-1) in both the unfolded and folded state.

The BN@N-CNs-2/S presents outstanding rate capacity of 528 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1), with extended cycle life and sluggish capacity decrease rate of 0.026% per cycle at 2 A g(-1) for more than 1000 cycles. Such high performance is a result of the unique sandwich structure of BN nanocrystals evenly compounded on N-CNs, which leads to uniform distribution of active sulfur species and effectively alleviates volume expansion in the cycling process. The BN@N-CNs sandwich structure possesses the key advantages of high conductivity of N-CNs, strong chemisorption and catalytic effect for LiPSs, which is demonstrated by theoretical calculations and cyclic voltammetry curves of the symmetrical cells.

Carbonsulfur was first prepared through the impregnation of sulfur into hollow carbon spheres under heat treatment, followed by a coating polymerization to give a double-layered coreshell structure. From the study of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images, we demonstrated that the sulfur not only successfully penetrated through the porous carbon shell but also aggregated along the inner wall of the carbon shell, which, for the first time, provided visible and convincing evidence that sulfur preferred diffusing into the hollow carbon rather than aggregating in/on the porous wall of the carbon. Taking advantage of this structure, a stable capacity of 900 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 degrees C after 150 cycles and 630 mA h g(-1) at 0.6 degrees C after 600 cycles could be obtained in Li/S batteries. We also demonstrated the feasibility of full cells using the sulfur electrodes to couple with the silicon film electrodes, which exhibited significantly improved cycling stability and efficiency. The remarkable electrochemical performance could be attributed to the desirable confinement of sulfur through the unique double-layered coreshell architectures.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is severely limited by several weaknesses such as the shuttle effect of polysulfides and the insulation of the electrochemical products of sulfur and Li2S/Li2S2. Here, by doping nitrogen and integrating highly dispersed cobalt catalysts, a porous carbon nanocage derived from glucose adsorbed metal-organic framework is developed as the host for a sulfur cathode. This host structure combines the reported positive effects, including high conductivity, high sulfur loading, effective stress release, fast lithium-ion kinetics, fast interface charge transport, fast redox of Li2Sn, and strong physical/chemical absorption, achieving a long cycle life (86% of capacity retention at 1C within 500 cycles) and high rate performance (600 mAh g(-1) at 5C) for a Li-S battery. By combining experiments and density functional theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that the well-dispersed cobalt clusters play an important role in greatly improving the diffusion dynamics of lithium, and enhance the absorption and conversion capability of polysulfides in the host structure.

The unique architecture not only provides a short and rapid charge transfer pathway to improve the reaction kinetics but also alleviates the volume expansion of sulfur during lithiation and minimizes the diffusion of intermediate polysulfides. Such an encouraging electrochemical environment ensures the excellent rate capability and high cycle stability. As a result, the as-prepared PEG-CNT/S composite with sulfur content of 75.9 wt % delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1191 and 897 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5%.

To inhibit the shuttle effect, a polysulfide adsorptive polymer polyethylenimine (PEI) is covalently bonded with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in a one-step hydrothermal reaction. Meanwhile, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are simultaneously interweaved with rGO. The resultant PEI-rGO-MWCNT aerogel (PEI-GC) provides ample chemisorption domains of amine groups and abundant electrical contact sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove a binding energy of 2.43 eV between PEI and polysulfide. The PEI-GC cell achieved a high capacity of 933 mA h g(-1) for the 500th cycle at 1C, stable rate performance up to 10C, and low self-discharge rate. The covalent bond between PEI and rGO experiences no degradation during the 500 cycles. Moreover, PEI-GC achieved excellent cycling performance at a high sulfur loading of up to 18 mg cm(-2).

The strategy in this work is highlighted to selective removal of intrinsic CaCO3 in shrimp shell followed by KOH activation to tune the pore sizes of the obtained carbons. On the basis of the different porous structures, the discharge capacity of the obtained carbons as Li-S cathodes follows the order of micro-mesoporous carbon>mesoporous carbon>microporous carbon. The high capacity of the micro-mesoporous carbon is attributed to its positive characters such as the coexistence of micro-mesoporous structure, the large pore volume and the high specific surface area. Furthermore, well-dispersed nitrogen in the porous carbons is naturally doped and inherited from shrimp shell, and can help to enhance cycle stability when used as cathodes. As a result, all carbon cathodes exhibit the good cycle stability (>78%) due to their nitrogen doping induced chemical adsorption of sulfur on the surface areas of the porous carbons. Among them, mesoporous carbon cathode shows the best cycle stability with 90% retention within 100 cycles, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of its both large pore size (5.12 nm) and high nitrogen content (6.67 wt %).

In this contribution, metal-free borocarbonitride nanotubes (BCNNTs) are readily fabricated by pyrolysis of an organic precursor and used as the sulfur host material in Li-S batteries for the first time. The unique nanotube structure and the existence of B and N endow BCNNTs with high surface area, excellent stability, improved electrical conductivity, and they show efficient physical and chemical anchoring and conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). By combining the fast Li+ and electron transportation, a Li-S battery with superior rate and cycling performance is achieved, which is consistent with the results of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Typically, BCNNT based Li-S batteries show prominent cycling life with a capacity degradation of 0.041% per cycle (1000 cycles) and a high sulfur loading of 5.3 mg cm(-2). This work defines an efficacious strategy to restrain the shuttle effect of LiPSs and shed light on the great potential of metal-free BCNNTs in Li-S batteries.

To meet the industrial requirements, however, effective sulfur host materials are highly desired for the enhanced sulfur loading and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) trapping. Herein, we describe the synthesis of N-doped hollow carbon composite embedded with well-dispersed Co/Co3O4 nanoparticles (Co/Co3O4-NHC) via the carbonization of a Zn/Co bimetallic metal-organic frameworks/ZnO nanospheres core-shell structure. The Co/Co3O4-NHC features uniform N-doping, intertwined carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and dual types of pores. ZnO nanospheres employed as a template for hollow structure also contribute to the formation of CNTs and micro-pores. The S-infiltrated Co/Co3O4-NHC cathode delivers an excellent rate performance (specific capacity of 447.9 mA h g(-1) at 5 C-rate) and stability (553.4 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles). With a high S loading (4 mg cm(-2)), 87.8% of specific capacity is retained after 250 cycles. This work can offer insights on designing the sulfur host materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, a multifunctional Nb2O5-carbon nanotube (CNT) catalytic interface is designed and fabricated onto the separator, which can directly trap the polysulfides and then rapidly catalyze their redox conversion for advanced Li-S batteries. The construction of conductive and catalytic Nb2O5-CNT interface could afford long-distance electron transfer network, strong chemisorptive properties, and rich catalytic sites for accelerating polysulfide conversion kinetics and regulating Li2S nucleation/dissolution. The sulfur cathode with the assistant of Nb2O5-CNT interface could deliver an initial discharge capacity of 1286 mAh g(-1) and remain 992 mAh g(-1) with a capacity retention of 77.0%, corresponding to a low capacity attenuation rate of 0.23% per cycle during 100 cycles at 0.2C. Meanwhile, the Nb2O5-CNT interface can greatly suppress the self discharge and effectively reduce the formation of lithium dendrite due to the inhibition of the shuttling effect. This work provides instructive insights to suppress the shuttle effect and accelerate redox conversion via designing a multifunctional catalytic interface for Li-S chemistry. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries still faces multiple challenges, including the shuttle effect of intermediate polysulfides, the low conductivity of sulfur and the large volume variation of sulfur cathode. To overcome these issues, here we reported a self-templated approach to prepare interconnected carbon nanotubes inserted/wired hollow Co3S4 nanoboxes (CNTs/Co3S4-NBs) as an efficient sulfur host material. Originating from the combination of three-dimensional CNT conductive network and polar Co3S4-NBs, the obtained hybrid nanocomposite of CNTs/Co3S4-NBs can offer ultrahigh charge transfer properties, and efficiently restrain polysulfides in hollow Co3S4-NBs via the synergistic effect of structural confinement and chemical bonding. Benefiting from the above advantages, the S@CNTs/Co3S4-NBs cathode shows a significantly improved electrochemical performance in terms of high reversible capacity, good rate performance, and long-term cyclability. More remarkably, even at an elevated temperature (50 degrees C), it still exhibits high capacity retention and good rate capacity.

In the preparation process, HCl-treated melamine (HTM) is selected as the sources of carbon and nitrogen. It not only realizes in situ growth of CNTs on the surface of MXene nanosheets with the catalysis of Ni, but also introduces efficient N-doping in both MXene and CNTs. Within the microsphere, MXene nanosheets interconnect with CNTs to form porous and conductive network. In addition, N-doped MXene and CNTs can provide strong chemical immobilization for polysulfides and effectively entrap them within the porous microspheres. Above-mentioned merits enable N-Ti3C2@CNT microspheres to be ideal sulfur host. When used in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, the N-Ti3C2@CNT microspheres/S cathode delivers initial specific capacity of 927 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and retains high capacity of 775 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles with extremely low fading rate (FR) of 0.016% per cycle. Furthermore, the cathode still shows high cycling stability at high C-rate of 4 C (capacity of 647 mAh g(-1) after 650 cycles, FR 0.027%) and high sulfur loading of 3 and 6 mg cm(-2) for Li-S batteries.

However, several problems still hinder its practical application, such as poor electron conductivity, large volumetric expansion, and severe shuttle effect. To overcome these obstacles, a metallic and polar sphere-like Co9S8 with high electron conductivity is designed and prepared. Merited from a large chemical affinity and improved integration with polar polysulfides (LiPSs), Co9S8 enables chemically immobilizing LiPSs effectively with an improved cycle life of Li-S batteries. Besides, the hollow sphere structure can physically block the diffusion of LiPSs into electrolyte. Sufficient internal space can accommodate more active materials and mitigate the volume expansion. The high electron conductivity of Co9S8 facilitates improving of electrochemical reaction kinetics. Thus, serving as host material for Li-S batteries, the Co9S8 electrode exhibits a high initial specific capacity of similar to 1200 mAh/g at 0.1 C and the discharge specific capacity retains 570 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.5 C.

However, there are still some serious problems for sulfur cathode in organic electrolyte, including the lower utilization and poor cycle performance of sulfur active material, which becomes a big barrier for the research and development of lithium-sulfur battery. This review introduces the recent research process of sulfur-carbon composite cathode based on various porous carbon to support elemental sulfur. The larger surface area and developed porosity of porous carbon are beneficial for the homogeneous dispersion of elemental sulfur, and the strong adsorbability arising from the micropores or mesopores can successfully restrain the solubility and loss of lithium polysulfides, thus leading to the improved electrochemical performance of the composite cathodes. Accordingly, this article mainly illustrates the electrochemical capacity and cycle stability of the composites arising from the various pore size of porous carbon. By comparing, it is suggested that hierarchical porous carbon with highly developed micropores and mesopores is the most promising carrier to loading elemental sulfur, as it can ensure both the excellent electrochemical cycle stability and larger electrochemical capacity of the sulfur cathode.

Rate capability and cycle characteristics	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							POLYSULFIDES	This paper reports on the investigation of rate capability and cycle characteristics of a lithium sulfur battery. The second discharge region where solid Li2S is formed on the surface of the carbon matrix in the cathode was highly sensitive to cathode thickness and discharge rate. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation suggests that thick Li2S layer formed at the surface of the cathode causes the diminution of the second discharge region at high discharge rate. Upon repeated cycle, the delocalization of the surface Li2S layer happened, however, the irreversible Li2S gradually increased with cycle as evidence by (SEM) and wave dispersive spectroscopy measurements, causing capacity fade. The formation of the irreversible Li2S was more significant for higher rates of discharge. It is believed that the destruction of the carbon matrix by stress generated during the localized deposition of Li2S is responsible for the formation of irreversible Li2S.

However, the shuttle effect leads to severe capacity fading and low coulombic efficiency. Here, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is designed and prepared via a feasible and simple method from trithiocyanuric acid (IRA) to anchor the polysulfides and suppress the shuttle effect. The obtained g-C3N4 exhibits strong chemical interaction with polysulfides due to its high N-doping of 56.87 at%, which is beneficial to improve the cycling stability of Li-S batteries. Moreover, the novel porous framework and high specific surface area of g-C3N4 also provide fast ion transport and broad reaction interface of sulfur cathode, facilitating high capacity output and superior rate performance of Li-S batteries. As a result, Li-S batteries assembled with g-C3N4 can achieve high discharge capacity of 1200 mAh/g at 0.2 C and over 800 mAh/g is remained after 100 cycles with a coulombic efficiency more than 99.5%. When the C-rate rises to 5 C, the reversible capacity of Li-S batteries can still maintain at 607 mAh/g. (C) 2019 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The obtained OMPW showed a large surface area (231.5 m(2) g(-1)), high aspect ratio, and interconnected large mesopores (similar to 23 nm). The OMPW was tested as a supercapacitor electrode and showed a specific capacitance of 453 F g(-1) at 0.25 A g(-1). A sulfur/OMPW (S/OMPW) cathode was fabricated via a simple solution method and a heat-treatment process for lithium/sulfur batteries (LSBs). The S/OMPW composite delivered a large discharge capacity reaching 1601 mAh g(-1) at the initial cycle, retaining 1014 mAh g(-1) at the 100th cycle at 0.1 C. The great electrochemical performances of the OMPW capacitor electrode and S/OMPW composite were attributed to the large specific surface areas and interconnected mesopores that could supply more active sites for the electrochemical reaction and facilitate mass transfer.

CoSnO3 cubes are bound by continuous carbon nanotube networks, with high specific surface area and vast mesoporous. CoSnO3 with multiple polar active sites has a strong chemical adsorption effect on lithium polysulfide, suppressing the shuttle effect. The carbon nanotubes have continuous conductive networks, which can provide physical confinement with polysulfides and good electrical conductivity. Through the effective combination of advantages of CoSnO3 and carbon nanotubes, CoSnO3/CNTs/S exhibits excellent sulfur storage performance. The maximum discharge capacity of CoSnO3/CNTs/S is 453.3 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 C. After 500 cycles, the discharge specific capacity is still 377.7 mAh g(-1). The simple synthesis of CoSnO3/CNTs/S with long cycle life provides a new direction for the future LSBs cathode material research.

Simultaneous Monitoring of Crystalline Active Materials and Resistance Evolution in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							X-RAY-DIFFRACTION; LI-S BATTERIES; IN-SITU; MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS; ENERGY DENSITY; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROLYTE; DESIGN; PRECIPITATION; SPECTROSCOPY	Operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a valuable tool for studying secondary battery materials as it allows for the direct correlation of electrochemical behavior with structural changes of crystalline active materials. This is especially true for the lithium-sulfur chemistry, in which energy storage capability depends on the complex growth and dissolution kinetics of lithium sulfide (Li2S) and sulfur (S-8) during discharge and charge, respectively. In this work, we present a novel development of this method through combining operando XRD with simultaneous and continuous resistance measurement using an intermittent current interruption (ICI) method. We show that a coefficient of diffusion resistance, which reflects the transport properties in the sulfur/carbon composite electrode, can be determined from analysis of each current interruption. Its relationship to the established Warburg impedance model is validated theoretically and experimentally. We also demonstrate for an optimized electrode formulation and cell construction that the diffusion resistance increases sharply at the discharge end point, which is consistent with the blocking of pores in the carbon host matrix. The combination of XRD with ICI allows for a direct correlation of structural changes with not only electrochemical properties but also energy loss processes at a nonequilibrium state and, therefore, is a valuable technique for the study of a wide range of energy storage chemistries.

Herein, the multifunctional SnS@C MS heterostructure consisting of porous carbon shell and SnS microflower-like core is prepared and demonstrated as an efficient LieS battery cathode with electrocatalytic activity. The integrated physical confinement, strong chemical interaction, and rapid polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion kinetics are mutually promoted to facilitate a successive LiPSs adsorption-conversion with a significantly suppressed shuttle effect. Notably, systematic investigations and experiments reveal that the porous carbon layer can strongly entrap the LiPSs and subsequently facilitate its conversion kinetics between the liquid and solid phases. As a result, SnS@C/S MS cathode can deliver a high initial capacity of 1074.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and ultra-stable cycling performance with a slow capacity decay rate of 0.073% per cycle over 600 cycles at 0.5 C. Moreover, the excellent durability with higher S loading and current densities are also achieved. Thus, this work proffers a facile and promising approach to design and prepare efficient LieS battery cathodes with high reversible capacities and excellent cycle performance. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present work, the electrode comprising carbon source viz., Acetylene Black (AB) and Manganese Oxide (MnO2) to serve as an efficient sulfur host in two different ratios (MnO2:AB as 10:20 (M1) and 20:10 (M2)) for Li/dissolved polysulfide batteries. The composite was characterized and studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy, Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements, High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and electrochemical performance such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge (C/D) tests. It shows good cycle performance and exhibits an initial capacity of 1540 mAh/g at 0.1 C between 1.5 and 3.0 V for MnO2 rich sample. Performance enhancement was also brought about by the adsorptive properties of MnO2 which help in locking the polysulfide discharge products within the cathode structure.

J	Sohn, H				Sohn, Hiesang			Deposition of Functional Organic and Inorganic Layer on the Cathode for the Improved Electrochemical Performance of Li-S Battery	KOREAN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH			English	Article						Li-S battery; Polysulfide dissolution; Electrode coating; Graphene oxide; Polyethylene oxide	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; CARBON; NANOCOMPOSITES; ELECTROLYTE; POLYMER	The loss of the sulfur cathode material through dissolution of the polysulfide into electrolyte causes a significant capacity reduction of the lithium-sulfur cell during the charge-discharge reaction, thereby debilitating the electrochemical performance of the cell. We addressed this problem by using a chemical and physical approach called reduction of polysulfide dissolution through direct coating functional inorganic (graphene oxide) or organic layer (polyethylene oxide) on electrode, since the deposition of external functional layer can chemically interact with polysulfide and physically prevent the leakage of lithium polysulfide out of the electrode. Through this approach, we obtained a composite electrode for a lithium-sulfur battery (sulfur: 60%) coated with uniform and thin external functional layers where the thin external layer was coated on the electrode by solution coating and drying by a subsequent heat treatment at low temperature (similar to 80 degrees C). The external functional layer, such as inorganic or organic layer, not only alleviates the dissolution of the polysulfide electrolyte during the charging/discharging through physical layer formation, but also makes a chemical interaction between the polysulfide and the functional layer. As-formed lithium-sulfur battery exhibits stable cycling electrochemical performance during charging and discharging at a reversible capacity of 700 similar to 1187 mAh/g at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA/g) for 30 cycles or more.

The one-pot solution method with low cost materials was designed to synthesize the cathode by annealing with different temperatures and consistent HCl etching steps for the precursor. The Li-S batteries made by this precursor showed remarkable charge-discharge stability (570.4mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at a 1C current density) and outstanding rate performance (1145.5, 717.9, and 672.5mA hg(-1) at 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 Ag-1 current densities) at 800 degrees C. The results indicated that the stable three-dimensional multi-layer hollow sphere structure relieved the volume expansion of sulfur, which had a significant impact on the polysulfide adsorption, inhibiting the "shuttle effect." Also, the rich doping of nitrogen in this structure produced many defects and active sites that improved the interfacial adsorption of polysulfides. While Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) shows its potential as a cathode material, the material design method used in this paper provides a unique approach to realizing a high performance sulfur cathode for Li-S batteries.

Recently, considerable progress has been made to improve the specific capacity and cycling life of the Li-S batteries, but most demonstrations are typically based on thin electrode with limited areal sulfur loading. Herein, we demonstrate a Li-S battery with electrospun carbon nanofiber/reduced graphene oxide (CNF/rGO) as the binder-free and self-standing host for lithium polysulfide-containing liquid active materials in the cathode. The matrix of intertwined long CNF networks with uniformly distributed rGO pieces promotes the long-range high-rate charge transfers in three dimensions, and provides sufficient porous spaces for polysulfide uptake. Plus the mechanical flexibility of the CNF/rGO membrane, thick electrode with high areal sulfur loading (20.3 mg/cm(2)) and high areal specific capacity (15.5 mAh/cm(2)) is demonstrated by a Li-S pouch cell with stable cycling performances.

The Ni particles of 20 nm with the higher cathode surface area show a superior capacity of 1066 mAhg(-1) sulfur compared to Ni particles of 40 and 100 nm for the first cycle. In addition, to further improve the capacity retention and discharge capacity of the cell, the effect of the graphene support on Ni nanoparticle dispersion and cycling performance is investigated. The results show a significant improvement in the discharge capacity compared to the other electrodes. This could be explained by the homogeneous distribution of Ni nanoparticle within the carbon matrix, which suppress the agglomeration and surface area loss of the Ni nanoparticle after cycling; as well as a synergetic effect of graphene structure and Ni nanoparticle.

The preparation was performed by sealing and heating molten lithium-sulfur batteries with different ratios of CNT, which was the positive active material. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern showed that composite material had more amorphous structure; the sample of C/CNT ratio of 3:1 exhibited the strongest amorphous, indicating that elemental sulfur was scattered into the pores of the carbon materials. Scanning electron microscopy showed that CNT was evenly dispersed into the activated carbon/sulfur composite materials in the anode material, forming a 3D conductive structure. The discharge specific capacity of the composite test exhibited that a small amount of CNT improved the discharge specific capacity of the anode material to active material for the preparation of activated carbon. The discharge specific capacity of CNT with 2:2 ratio was up to 1371.1 mAh/g. After the first 50 cycles, the discharge specific capacity could be stabilized at 687.3 mAh/g.

Herein, composites of highly active Fe3O4 electrocatalytic nanocrystals embedded in carbon nanospheres (Fe3O4/CNSs) are introduced into Li-S batteries through separator modification for accelerating polysulfide redox conversion and alleviating polysulfide shuttling. Monodisperse Fe3O4/CNSs with a size of 50-200 nm are prepared for the first time using an anti-solvent induced crystallization process, in which ultrafine Fe3O4 nanocrystals are homogeneously dispersed in the carbon nanosphere framework with a high mass ratio of up to 43.6%. By virtue of Fe3O4 nanocrystals, the kinetics and thermodynamics of multistep polysulfide redox reactions are greatly improved, including improved adsorption interactions, accelerated Li2S6 consumption reactions and a lowered Gibbs energy barrier of Li2S6 to Li2S reactions as confirmed by adsorption experiments, symmetrical cell tests and DFT calculations. In addition, the presence of Fe3O4 can also reduce the energy barrier for initial Li2S nucleation and enhance the kinetics of the subsequent Li2S electrodeposition. As a result, the pure sulfur cathode assisted by chemisorption-catalysis functionalized Fe3O4/CNSs-PP separators could deliver a high reversible specific capacity of 1210 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and an ultralow capacity attenuation of 0.027% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1C. Even under a high current rate of 5C, the sulfur cathode still maintains a specific capacity of 649 mA h g(-1). This feasible approach toward Fe3O4/CNSs will open up alternative pathways for fabricating other ultrafine nanocrystal composites for electrochemical and catalytic applications.

Straightforward synthesis of Sulfur/N,S-codoped carbon cathodes for Lithium-Sulfur batteries	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ONE-STEP SYNTHESIS; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; NITROGEN; COMPOSITES	An upgrade of the scalable fabrication of high-performance sulfur-carbon cathodes is essential for the widespread commercialization of this technology. Herein we present a simple, cost-effective and scalable approach for the fabrication of cathodes comprising sulfur and high-surface area, N,S-codoped carbons. The method involves the use of a sulfur salt, i.e. sodium thiosulfate, as activating agent, sulfur precursor and S-dopant, and polypyrrole as carbon precursor and N-dopant. In this way, the production of the porous host and the incorporation of sulfur are combined in the same procedure. The porous hosts thus produced have BET surface areas in excess of 2000 m(2) g(-1), a micro-mesoporous structure, as well as sulfur and nitrogen contents of 5-6 wt% and similar to 2 wt%, respectively. The elemental sulfur content in the composites can be precisely modulated in the range of 24 to ca. 90 wt% by controlling the amount of sodium thiosulfate used. Remarkably, these porous carbons are able to accommodate up to 80 wt% sulfur exclusively within their porosity. When analyzed in lithium-sulfur batteries, these sulfur-carbon composites show high specific capacities of 1100 mAh g(-1) at a low C-rate of 0.1C and above 500 mAh g(-1) at a high rate of 2C for sulfur contents in the range of 50-80 wt%. Remarkably, the composites with 51-65 wt% S can still provide above 400 mAh g(-1) at an ultra-fast rate of 4C (where a charge and discharge cycle takes only ten minutes). The good rate capability and sulfur utilization was additionally assessed for cathodes with a high sulfur content (65-74%) and a high sulfur loading (>5 mg cm(-2)). In addition, cathodes of 4 mg cm(-2) successfully cycled for 260 cycles at 0.2C showed only a low loss of 0.12%/cycle.

Physical and chemical confinement by carbon or noncarbon hosts has been used to block LiPS shuttling, but this may only be a complete solution to the problem if it combines with LiPS fast conversion into an insoluble sulfide. Here we report a twinborn TiO2-TiN heterostructure that combines the merits of highly adsorptive TiO2 with conducting TiN and achieves smooth trapping-diffusion-conversion of LiPSs across the interface. TiO2 has high adsorption for LiPSs while TiN promotes their conversion into insoluble Li2S. The fast diffusion of LiPSs from TiO2 to TiN helps achieve both high trapping efficiency and fast conversion. By loading such a heterostructure onto graphene, which acts as a physical barrier, a compact and thin coating is fabricated on the separator, and LiPS shuttling is greatly restrained even with a high sulfur loading. A capacity of 927 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles is obtained under a low current density of 0.3C. Over 2000 cycles, capacity retentions of 73% and 67% at 1C are achieved for sulfur loadings of 3.1 and 4.3 mg cm(-2). Such an interlayer is expected to promote the practical use of Li-S batteries because of the simple processing and the resulting outstanding capacity and cyclic performance.

Herein, MoS2 is verified to reduce the Gibbs free energy for rate-limiting step of sulfur reduction and the dissociation energy of lithium sulfide (Li2S) for the first time employing theoretical calculations. The MoS2 nanosheets coated on mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (MHCS) are then reasonably designed as a sulfur host for high-capacity and long-life Li-S battery, in which MHCS can guarantee the high sulfur loading and fast electron/ion transfer. It is revealed that the shuttle effect is efficiently inhibited because of the boosted conversion of LiPSs. As a result, the coin cell based on the MHCS@MoS2-S cathode exhibits stable cycling performance maintaining 735.7 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0 C. More importantly, the pouch cell employing the MHCS@MoS2-S cathodes achieves high specific capacity of 1353.2 mAh g(-1) and prominent cycle stability that remaining 960.0 mAh g(-1) with extraordinary capacity retention of 79.8% at 0.1 C after 170 cycles. Therefore, this work paves a new avenue for developing practical high specific energy and long-life pouch-type Li-S batteries.

Here we report a strategy to fabricate reduced graphene oxide coated MoO2 with defect engineered and thiol modified nanotubes (H-S@MoO2/rGO) as highly stable host material for cathode in Li-S batteries. Thiourea was used as sulfur source and etching agent to construct the hollow architecture and realize thiol modification of MoO2 with the aid of ethanol. The modifying H-S@MoO2/rGO nanotubes offer improved affinity with LiPSs and accelerating the conversion kinetics from LiPSs to final Li2S. Oxygen vacancy remarkably reduce energy barrier and facilitating charge transfer, improving catalytic activity, regulating the deposition of Li2S on electrode surface. Furthermore, H-S@MoO2/rGO nanotubes offer enough interior capacity for high sulfur loading of 84 wt% (donate as S-S@MoO2/rGO), effectively confine sulfur through confinement effect. The simultaneous defect-engineered and thiol modified of MoO2 effectively cooperate the adsorption, diffusion and conversion of LiPSs in sulfur redox process, synergistically enable host material effective adsorption-conversion function for polysulfide. The developed S-S@MoO2/rGO cathodes exhibit excellent rate performance and superior reliability with a high specific capacity of 927 mAh g(-1) and small capacity fading rate of 0.042% per cycle over 500 cycles at 0.1 Ag-1. This work shows a feasible and effective method to analyze the systematic kinetic and in-depth mechanism explanation of functional groups modifying metal oxide to guide the design of effective catalysts for practical application in lithium-sulfur batteries.

The unique 3DOM framework provides abundant space for sulfur accommodation and effective pathways for electrolyte infiltration. The robust titanium oxynitride skeleton also ensures good structural integrity during the repeated charge/discharge cycling. Meanwhile, the introduction of oxygen defects not only improves the intrinsic conductivity of the TiO2 skeleton but also enhances its capability for lithium polysulfide (LiPS) trapping. The N-CNTs embedded in the macroporous framework form an ultra-high conductive network and also provide rich micropores for sulfur distribution and physical confinement. The highly dispersed Co nanoparticles uniformly anchored on TiOxNy and N-CNTs act as electrocatalysts promoting the conversion of LiPSs. Attributed to these features, the Co@TiOxNy/N-CNTs/S electrode presents good rate capability and excellent cycling performance. Even under a sulfur loading of 6.34 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte to sulfur ratio (E/S = 8 mu L mg(-1)), a high area capacity of 5.05 mA h cm(-2) can be achieved after 50 cycles. The flexible pouch cell also delivers an impressive discharge capacity of 972 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles under a sulfur loading of 4 mg cm(-2). This work offers a rational strategy for the design of advanced sulfur cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Nevertheless, the insulating nature of traditional MOFs render retarded kinetics of polysulfides conversion, leading to insufficient utilization of sulfur. In comparison, conductive MOFs (c-MOFs) show great potential for promoting polysulfides transformation due to superb electronic conductivity. In this work, a nickel-catecholates based c-MOF, NiHHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene), is designed to regulate surface chemistry of self-supported carbon paper for advanced Li-S batteries. Taking advantage of the porous structure and high conductivity, the as-prepared Ni-HHTP is conducive to synergising strengthening the chemisorption of polysulfides and accelerating the reaction kinetics in Li-S batteries, significantly mitigating the polysulfides diffusion from the non-encapsulated sulfur cathode, therefore promoting polysulfides transformation in Li-S batteries. This work points out a promising modification strategy for developing advanced sulfur cathode in Li-S batteries.

Herein we report a novel all-in-one cell design introduced by a porous-dense-porous trilayer garnet electrolyte. Both lithium anode and the sulfur cathode are infiltrated in the porous garnet framework, resulting in the first reported solid-state all-in-one battery. The interconnected 3D garnet electrolyte provides ion pathways throughout the whole cell while the conformal coating of carbon nanotubes and infiltrated lithium metal form continuous pathways for electrons. The all-in-one cell design has the following advantages: (1) continuous pathways for Li+ and electrons that lead to a lower resistance, (2) all-solid-state lithium metal anode eliminating the formation of an SEI, (3) seamless contact between the garnet and lithium metal introduced by a ZnO surface treatment that results in small interface resistance, (4) low local current density at an applied areal current density due to high contact area of the 3D porous structure, (5) locally confined volume changes for both anode and cathode, avoiding dead Li and dead S formation, (6) the use of a thin dense ceramic electrolyte as a separator enabled by the trilayer architecture, which is otherwise impossible due to inherent brittleness of thin film ceramics, (7) unique approaches for cell manufacturing and packaging made available by the all-in-one design, which bring about new opportunities. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the all-in-one Li-S battery which completely eliminates lithium polysulfide shuttling and lithium dendrite penetration, leading to a high efficiency and safe operating battery system. With both lithium and sulfur infused in the porous layer of the solid-state electrolyte, the proposed Li-S battery achieves a high capacity of over 1200 mAh/gS and nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, demonstrating the advantages of the all-in-one design.

However, there are still problems to be resolved such as poor conductivity of sulfur cathodes and dissolution of polysulfides in organic electrolytes. Herein, a novel ZIF-8-derived nitrogen-doped connected ordered macro-microporous carbon (COM-MPC) was developed by a dual solvent-assisted in situ crystallization method within a face-centered cubic stacking sphere template, which acts as an advanced sulfur host for enhanced Li-S battery performance. Compared with the conventional predominant microporous C-ZIF-8, the unique hierarchical macro-microporous structure with nitrogen doping not only renders polysulfide intermediates enhanced entrapment by confining the effect of micropores and chemisorption of doping N atoms, but also facilitates electrolyte accessibility and efficient ion transport owing to the ordered macroporous structure. Benefitting from this, the COM-MPC@S cathode delivers a high initial specific capacity of 1498.5 mA h g(-1) and a reversible specific capacity of 1118.9 mA h g(-1). Moreover, the COM-MPC@S cathode exhibits 82.3% of capacity retention within 10th to 50th cycle at 0.5C and a large capacity of 608.5 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at a higher rate of 1C, and this enhanced cycling stability and rate capability demonstrate great practical application potential in Li-S battery systems.

However, the performance of a conventional two-dimensional Al foil current collector is limited by its smooth/nonporous surface and poor flexibility, which is unfavorable for the achievement of high sulfur loading and sufficient polysulfide adsorption. Hence, a three-dimensional porous Fe-doped polypyrrole aerogel (FPA) is developed by a simple and scalable strategy combing the solution reaction with the freeze-drying technique, aiming at acting as the current collector of cathode to address these issues in Li-S batteries. This FPA possesses a conductive porous network structure with high elasticity and abundant Fe dopants, which can not only buffer the large volume change of sulfur and ensure fast ion/electron transfer, but also effectively anchor the polysulfides and lower the negative polarization effect during cycling. As a result, the FPA@S cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1196.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a retained capacity of 829.5 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, with stabilized Coulombic efficiency and excellent rate performance. This FPA@S cathode also achieves a high cell-level gravimetric energy density of 199.7 Wh kg(cell)(-1) even under a high sulfur-loading (8.57 mg cm(-2)) and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (6 mL g(-1)), demonstrating its practical potential in future advanced high-energy battery systems.

Novel liquid-phase mixing contributed to improving electrochemical properties through solid-electrolyte penetration into the mesopores of the carbon replica. Combined mechanical and liquid-phase mixing realized a solid-state battery with high electrochemical performance comparable to a liquid battery system. A discharge capacity in excess of 1500 mAh g(-1) and a high Coulombic efficiency of about 100% were demonstrated at an applied pressure of 213 MPa. The novel sulfur-electrode fabrication method enhances battery performance, since the ionic conduction pathway in the composite electrode is increased.

Herein, a novel multifunctional sulfur host composed of hollow carbon spheres with mesoporous channels (MHCS) coupled with few ultrathin Mo2C/C nanosheets embedded with Mo2C nanocrystals (MHCS@Mo2C/C) has been prepared via one-pot self-assembly and in-situ grown strategies. The Mo2C/C nanosheets with heterostructure can shorten the electron/ion transport path, and ultra-small Mo2C nanocrystals with abundant active sites contribute to enhancing chemical adsorption towards polysulfides and propel their conversion. Meanwhile, the MHCS facilitates physical adsorption towards polysulfides, effective sulfur/electrolyte permeation, fast electron/ion transportation, and sufficient buffering for volume change. Given these, the multifunctional MHCS@Mo2C/C-S cathode demonstrates an initial specific capacity of 1316.8 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and outstanding cycling stability with an average capacity decay rate of 0.045 % for 500 cycles at 0.5 C. Moreover, MHCS@Mo2C/C-S cathode with high areal sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm-2 can deliver a high initial discharge specific capacity of 797.4 mAh g-1, and a reversible capacity of 542.7 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. It is expected this work could provide a new perspective to the rational design of sulfur hosts for Li-S batteries with enhanced performance.

Herein, a novel host material made of micro-mesoporous carbon nanospheres (MMC NSs) with well-dispersed ultrafine NiS2-ZnS (uNiS(2)-ZnS) heterostructures is synthesized for the first timeviaa simplein situsulfuration process. The uNiS(2)-ZnS/MMC materials achieve the synergistic effect of physical confinement and the efficient chemical adsorption/catalysis of LiPSs through a micro-mesoporous structure and well-dispersed uNiS(2)-ZnS heterostructures. In addition, compared with bulk heterostructured materials, the uNiS(2)-ZnS heterostructures greatly enhance the adsorption and catalytic ability toward LiPSs because the catalysis interface effect and naturally formed in-plane interfaces can be magnified by the ultrafine dispersed nanoparticles. As a result, the prepared uNiS(2)-ZnS/MMC-S cathodes exhibit outstanding rate capacity (675.5 mA h g(-1)at 5.0C) and cyclic stability (710.5 mA h g(-1)at 1.0C after 1000 cycles with a low capacity decay of 0.033% per cycle).

In the first discharge, the sulfur cathodes containing carbon blacks with a high surface area, KB-600 (S-BET = 1270 m(2)/g), Printex XE-2 (S-BET = 950 m(2)/g), or Cabot BP-2000 (S-BET = 1487 m(2)/g), showed much higher discharge capacities (>1200 mA h/g) than the sulfur cathode (710 mA h/g) with Super-P (S-BET = 62 m(2)/g). It was observed that the sulfur cathodes with KB-600, Printex XE-2, or Cabot BP-2000, which showed very similar discharge capacities one another at a low rate of 0.2 C, exhibited significantly different electrochemical behavior (the discharge capacity and midvoltage) at a high rate of 1.0 C. In particular, the sulfur cathode with KB-600 showed an extremely high capacity (831 mA h/g) with a midvoltage of 2.07 V at a 1.0 C rate, and excellent capacity retention (79%) after 50 cycles.

Sulfur utilization can be augmented in electrolytes based on solvents with high Gutmann Donor Number; however, violent lithium metal corrosion is a drawback. Here we report that particulate lithium sulfide growth can be achieved using a salt anion with a high donor number, such as bromide or triflate. The use of bromide leads to similar to 95 % sulfur utilization by suppressing electrode passivation. More importantly, the electrolytes with high-donor-number salt anions are notably compatible with lithium metal electrodes. The approach enables a high sulfur-loaded cell with areal capacity higher than 4mA h cm-2 and high sulfur utilization (> 90 %). This work offers a simple but practical strategy to modulate lithium sulfide growth, while conserving stability for high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

In the discharge process, sulfur transforms into lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) that dissolve in liquid electrolytes and then into insoluble Li2S precipitated on the electrode surface. The electronically and ionically insulating Li2S leads to two critical issues, including the sluggish reaction kinetics from LiPSs to Li2S and the passivation of the electrode. In this regard, controlling the Li2S deposition is significant for improving the performance of LSBs. In this perspective, we have summarized the recent achievements in regulating the Li2S deposition to enhance the performance of LSBs, including the solution-mediated growth of Li2S, sulfur host enhanced nucleation and catalysis induced kinetic improvement. Moreover, the challenges and possibilities for future research studies are discussed, highlighting the significance of regulating the Li2S deposition to realize the high electrochemical performance and promote the practical uses of LSBs.

Here, we report SnO2 as a chemical adsorbent for polysulfides. As an interlayer between the cathode and separator, SnO2 gives better results to prevent the polysulfides from diffusing to the lithium anode than as a modifier of the carbon matrix directly. The lithium-sulfur battery with an SnO2 interlayer delivers an initial reversible capacity of 996 mA h g(-1) and retains 832 mA h g(-1) at the 100th discharge at 0.5 C, with a fading rate of only 0.19% per cycle. The improvements benefit from the quasi-open space provided by the interlayer configuration for the diffused sulfur species, which can largely relieve the loss of active substances caused by the volume effect during the lithiation/delithiation process.

The Y-CA materials exhibit interconnected porous structures and high adsorption ability. The Y-CA/S composites loaded with sulfur served as cathode materials in lithium-sulfur batteries to suppress the polysulfide diffusion and offer high electrical conductivity during the charge/discharge process. In particular, the designed Y2-CA/S cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1369 mA h g(-1) and retained 1108 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C. The Y2-CA/S cathode presents a good rate capability of 994 mA h g(-1) up to 2C and nice long-term cycling stability with a high reversible capacity of 892 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.5C. The excellent electrochemical performance of the batteries is attributed to high adsorption ability and the uniform Y2O3 distribution on the porous and interrelated carbon spheres.

Herein we report an efficient sulfur host based on two oxides, in which SiO2 hollow spheres with radial meso-channels are covered by a thin TiO2 coating. SiO2 spheres not only yield high sulfur loading as high as 80 wt% but also possess strong lithium polysulfides (LiPS) adsorption capability. The thin TiO2 coating can effectively prevent the LiPS outward diffusion, giving rise to a long-term stability. Meanwhile, the oxide-supported carbon from the carbonization of surfactants enables good electrical conductivity to facilitate electron access and improve sulfur utilization. Experimental and theoretical studies show the strong adsorption of LiPS by SiO2. Benefitting from the unique structural and compositional advantages, we achieve a high sulfur loading up to 80 wt% with similar to 65.5% and 33% capacity retentions over 500 and 1000 cycles when tested at 0.5 C and 1 C, respectively.

The physical properties of porous g-C3N4 were characterized by various measurement methods: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ay photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of thermal-pyrolysis temperature on electrochemical behaviors of was researched as the sulfur matrices in lithium-sulfur batteries. The g-C3N4 prepared at 550 A degrees C with sulfur matrix exhibits the superior electrochemical performances. As the result, the sulfur/CN-550 composite cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1262.1 mAh g(-1) and delivers a specific capacity of 605.4 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles at 0.39 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrochemical behavior of the g-C3N4 could be ascribed to the effective utilization of sulfur and the combination of polysulfides dissolution through physical and chemical interactions to achieve long-term circulation of the composite cathode in lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, current main challenges in Li-S battery are structural degradation and instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase caused by the dissolution of polysulfides during cycling, resulting in the corrosion and loss of active materials. Herein, we developed novel hybrids by employing metal organic polyhedron (MOP) encapsulated PVP-functionalized sulfur nanoparticles (S@MOP), where the active sulfur component was efficiently encapsulated within the core of MOP and PVP as a surfactant was helpful to stabilize the sulfur nanoparticles and control the size and shape of corresponding hybrids during their syntheses. The amount of sulfur embedded into MOP could be controlled according to requirements. By using the S@MOP hybrids as cathodes, an obvious enhancement in the performance of Li-S battery was achieved, including high specific capacity with good cycling stability. The MOP encapsulation could enhance the utilization efficiency of sulfur. Importantly, the structure of the S@MOP hybrids was very stable, and they could last for almost 1000 cycles as cathodes in Li-S battery. Such high performance has rarely been obtained using metal organic framework systems. The present approach opens up a promising route for further applications of MOP as host materials in electrochemical and energy storage fields.

Nevertheless, this field remains elusive. We report the scalable salt-templated synthesis of Se-vacancy-incorporated MoSe2 architecture (SeVs-MoSe2) and reveal the phase evolution of the defective precatalyst in working Li-S batteries. The interaction between lithium polysulfides and SeVs-MoSe2 is probed to induce the transformation from SeVs-MoSe2 to MoSeS. Furthermore, operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements in combination with theoretical simulations verify that the effectual MoSeS catalyst could help promote conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S, thereby boosting the capacity performance. The Li-S battery accordingly exhibits a satisfactory rate and cycling capability even with and elevated sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions (7.67 mg cm(-2); 4.0 mu L mg(S)(-1)). This work elucidates the design strategies and catalytic mechanisms of efficient electrocatalysts bearing defects.

Nevertheless, existing challenges such as formidable shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics hinder its practical application. Herein, we propose a universal interface and defect engineering dual-strategy to design graphene-oxide (G-oxide) hybrids as heterostructured electrocatalysts targeting promoted Li-S chemistry. The employment of direct plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique allows the in situ formation of graphene over a suite of oxide powders. Benefiting from the creation of heterointerface and carbon/oxygen defects, G-oxide realizes balanced management of polysulfide adsorption, lithium-ion migration and electron transportation, accordingly rendering bi-directional electrocatalysis behaviors for the sulfur conversion. Thus-assembled S/G-oxide cathode affords stable cycling performances even under a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm-2 and an electrolyte usage of 4.0 mu L mg-1S.

The lithium-sulfur battery has the advantages of high energy density and low material cost. It is considered to be one of the most promising energy storage technology batteries. Although it has developed rapidly in recent decades, there is still a crucial problem: the shuttle of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs). To solve this critical problem, the Ni-VO2 nanoflower structure is designed to strongly adsorb LiPSs, lower the Li2S decomposition barrier, accelerate the effective discharge in the reaction process, and improve the Coulomb efficiency. Particularly, the Ni-VO2 coating layer demonstrated a high initial discharge capacity of 853 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and retained a stable cycling performance with a reversible capacity of 632 mAh g(-1) over 1000 cycles (capacity decay of 0.002% per cycle). Even under extreme conditions of 0 and 60 degrees C, the capacities of 700 and 920 mAh g(-1) are maintained, respectively. Such excellent wide temperature performance and cycle stability reveal its good potential for use in advanced Li-S batteries.

However, the commercial applications of Li-S batteries have long been plagued by the shuttling effect of polysulfides and sluggish redox kinetics of these species. Herein, we designed a novel battery separator coated by a europium oxide-doped porous Ketjen Black (Eu2O3/KB) and tested its performance for the Li-S batteries for the first time. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the presence of Eu2O3. The strong binding effect between Eu2O3 and polysulfides is demonstrated in two aspects: (1) there exist strong interactions between Eu2O3 as a Lewis acid and polysulfides of strong Lewis basicity; (2) Eu2O3 with oxygen-vacancy defects provides active sites for catalyzing polysulfide conversion and polysulfide trapping. Thus, a Li-S battery with the Eu2O3/KB modified separator delivers highly stable cycling performance and excellent rate capability, with the capacity decay ratio of merely 0.05% per cycle under 1 C rate during 500 cycles, and high specific capacity of 563 mAh g(-1) at 3 C rate. This work offers a meaningful exploration of the application of rare earth oxides for the modification of the separator towards high performance Li-S batteries.

It is crucial to confine sulfurous species in cathodic chamber for utmost suppression of the polysulfide shuttle. Herein, a dual-trapping policy is formulated to solve the issue. The MnO2-decorated graphene aerogel (MG) is applied to modify the Celgard separator, and the I/N codoped graphene aerogel (ING) is prepared as the cathode sulfur host. Both the MG@Sep separator and the ING/S cathode could efficiently capture polysulfides and promote the utilization of active sulfur. As a consequence, the tailored Li-S cell with the MG@Sep+ING/S combination shows durable cycle stability in addition to high initial capacity as well as capacity retention. The used electrodes and the separator are all in good conditions after 200 cycles, and no shuttled sulfurous species can be observed on the anode. Therefore, it is hopeful to impulse Li-S battery engineering by optimizing such a dual-trapping policy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, by coating a layer of nano titanium dioxide and carbon black onto a commercial polypropylene separator, we demonstrate a new composite separator that can confine the polysulfides on the cathode side, forming a catholyte chamber, and at the same time block the dendritic lithium on the anode side. Lithium-sulfur batteries using this separator show a high initial capacity of 1206 mA h g(-1) and a low capacity decay rate of 0.1% per cycle at 0.5C. Analyses reveal the electrocatalytic effect and the excellent dendrite-blocking capability of the similar to 7 mu m thick coating.

Lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx)-dissolved electrolyte, so called catholyte, enables high utilization of sulfur, but the cell inherently has high E/S ratio due to the limited solubility of Li2Sx. Herein, a composite electrode of Li2Sx (x = 4, 6, 8) and sub-millimeter-long few-wall carbon nanotube (CNT) is proposed. The CNT forms self-supporting sponge-like paper and works as a three-dimensional current collector, in which the Li2Sx is deposited by solution casting and drying. The Li2S6-CNT electrode realizes high specific capacity (1249 mAh g(sulfur)(-1)) under a lean electrolyte condition of E/S = 4 mu L mg(sulfur)(-1), which is much better than the S-8-CNT electrode (233 mAh g(sulfur)(-1)). After full charge and conversion of Li2Sx to S, the Li2S6-CNT electrode maintains its high capacity of 1100 mAh g(sulfur)(-1). The full cell with the Li2S6-CNT and the Li thin foil electrodes realizes 400-500 Wh kg e l ll for E/S = 4.0 at the 2nd and 3rd discharge and 300 Wh kg(cell)(-1) for E/S = 5.8 at the 97th discharge, based on the total mass of the interior of a cell (electrodes, separator, and electrolyte). Holding solvated Li2Sx by the CNT sponge is the key for the high energy density. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, structured titanium nitride nanotubes with tunable dimensions are investigated for their performance on Li-S batteries. We firstly develop a facile method to synthesize TiN nanotubes through anodization of Ti foils and nitridation. Surface morphology and BET surface area are characterized. The change of interfacial resistance, electrochemical performance and stability of batteries are evaluated as a function of nanotube length and diameter. The best electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries observed is for the 30 mu m long and 65 nm diameter TiN nanotubes, which has a high discharge capacity of 1338 mAh g(-1) after 180 cycles at 0.1 degrees C, and with only 0.064% average capacity decay per cycle. Furthermore, increase in nanotube length from 4.5 to 30 mu m and decrease in nanotube diameter from 100 to 35 nm of titanium nitride enhance capacity by 19.1% and 24.7% after 180 discharge/charge cycles, respectively. This study suggests nano-structure with tunable geometry can play a significant role in battery performance and cyclability, and that TiN nanotubes could serve as a very promising cathode material for advanced Li-S batteries.

However, for practical use there remains some key problems to be solved, such as low active material utilization and rapid capacity fading, especially at high areal sulfur loadings. Here, we report a facile one-pot method to prepare porous three-dimensional nitrogen, sulfur-codoped graphene through hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide with multi-ion mixture modulation. We show solid evidence that the results of multi-ion mixture modulation can not only improve the surface affinity of the nanocarbons to polysulfides, but also alter their assembling manner and render the resultant 3D network a more favorable pore morphology for accommodating and confining sulfur. It also had an excellent rate performance and cycling stability, showing an initial capacity of 1304 mA h g(-1) at 0.05C, 613 mA h g(-1) at 5C and maintaining a reversible capacity of 462 mA h g(-1) after 1500 cycles at 2C with capacity fading as low as 0.028% per cycle. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 5.1 mA h cm(-2) at 0.2C is achieved at an areal sulfur loading of 6.3 mg cm(-2), which are the best values reported so far for dual doped sulfur cathodes.

Here, borrowing the concepts from air filtration, we design and fabricate a protein-based nanofilter for effectively trapping polysulfides but facilitating Li+ transport. The unique porous structures are formed through a protein-directed self-assembly process, and the surfaces are functionalized by the protein residues. The experiments and molecular simulation results demonstrate that our polysulfide nanofilter can effectively trap the dissolved polysulfides and promote Li+ transport in Li-S batteries. When the polysulfide nanofilter is added in a Li-S battery, the electrochemical performance of the battery is significantly improved. Moreover, the contribution of the protein nanofilter to the ion transport is further analyzed by correlating filter properties and battery performance. This study is of universal significance for the understanding, design, and fabrication of advanced battery interlayers that can help realize good management of the ion transport inside advanced energy storage devices.

However, the achievements are generally based on the low S-content in the composites and the low S-loading on the electrode. Herein, a leaf-like graphene oxide (GO), which includes an inherent carbon nanotube midrib in the GO plane, is synthesized for preparing GO/S composites. Owing to the inherent high conductivity of carbon nanotube midribs and the abundant surface groups of GO for S-immobilization, the composite with an S-content of 60 wt% exhibits ultralong cycling stability over 1000 times with a low capacity decay of 0.033% per cycle and a high rate up to 4C. When the S-content is increased to 75 wt%, the composite still shows a perfect cycling performance over 1000 cycles. Even with the high S-loading of 2.7 mg cm(-2) on the electrode and the high S-content of 85 wt%, it still shows a promising cycling performance over 600 cycles.

This MoN-C-MoN trilayer architecture causes the strong conformal adsorption of S/Li2Sx and its high-efficiency conversion on the two-sided nitride polar surfaces, which are supplied with high-flux electron transfer from the buried carbon interlayer. The 3D self-assembly of these 2D sandwich structures further reinforces the interconnection of conductive and catalytic networks. The maximized exposure of adsorptive/catalytic planes endows the MoN-C@S electrode with excellent cycling stability and high rate performance even under high S loading and low host surface area. The high conductivity of this trilayer texture does not compromise the capacity retention after the S content is increased. Such a job-synergistic mode between catalytic and conductive functions guarantees the homogeneous deposition of S/Li2Sx, and avoids thick and devitalized accumulation (electrode passivation) even after high-rate and long-term cycling.

Thus, the key to improve the performance of a Lithium-Sulfur battery is to suppress the shuttling effect. Herein, we report a NbN modified PP separator with high performance for Lithium-Sulfur battery applications. The NbN functionalized layer of the separator can strongly interact with soluble polysulfide species, as demonstrated by both experimental investigation and theoretical verification. As a result of the high polysulfide affinity, the composite separator effectively prevents the shuttling of soluble polysulfide through the separator. Besides, the high electrolyte wettability of NbN modification layer lowers the resistance of Li+ transport through the separator. Due to these favorable features, Lithium-Sulfur battery assembled with the multifunctional NbN modified separator exhibits excellent cycling performance with a reversible capacity of 554.6 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C. The significantly improved rate performance of the battery based on the modified separator is also demonstrated. Our results show that NbN is a promising material for the modification of separators in Lithium-Sulfur battery and the strategy of separator engineering is effective for improving the performance of Lithium-Sulfur battery.

One-pot conversion of carbon dioxide to CNT-grafted graphene bifunctional for sulfur cathode and thin interlayer of Li-S battery	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						CO2 conversion; Graphene; Carbon nanofiber; Li-S battery cathode; Li-S battery interlayer	POROUS CARBON; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; CO2 CONVERSION; LITHIUM; REDUCTION; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODE; OXYGEN; BORON; NANOCOMPOSITES	Gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) was converted into few-layered graphene sheets grafted by carbon nanofibers (G-CNEs) at the atmospheric pressure. The synthesis was performed in a one-pot route by the thermal Mg-aided reduction of CO2 in the presence of nickel nanoparticles that have a crucial role in the growth of carbon nanolibers. The produced G-CNF was bifunctionally applied as a cathode supporter for elemental sulfur and a thin interlayer for the separator in the Li-S battery. The graphene layers exfoliated by the carbon nanofibers enabled the formation of semi-freestanding membrane through sonication in a surfactant solution. They were attached on the separator to be used as a several micron-thick interlayer. The G-CNF employed as both cathode and interlayer materials enhanced the charge-discharge capacity and stability due to its low electrical resistivity and its role as a barrier to the polysulfides shuttle. As a result, a high capacity of 820 mAhg(-1) and 640 mA h g(-1) after 100 and 500 cycles were acquired at 0.5 C, respectively. The results suggest not only the facile one-step conversion of atmospheric CO2 to the exfoliated graphene grafted by carbon nanofibers, but also its outstanding electrochemical performance in the Li-S battery.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is still impeded due to the low utilization of sulfur and serious shuttle-effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Here, we fabricated the porous honeycomb-like C3N4 (PHCN) through a hard template method. As a polar material, graphitic C3N4 has abundant nitrogen content (similar to 58%), which can provide enough active sites to mitigate shuttle-effect, and then conductive reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was introduced to combine with PHCN to form PHCN/rGO composite in order to improve the utilization efficiency of sulfur. After sulfur loading, the PHCN/rGO/S cathode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1,061.1 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and outstanding rate performance at high current density of 5 C (495.1 mA h g(-1)), and also retained 519 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 1 C. Even at high sulfur loading (4.3 mg cm(-2)), the capacity fade rate was only 0.16% per cycle at 0.5 C for 200 cycles. The above results de monstrate that the special design of PHCN/rGO composite as sulfur host has high potential application for Li-S rechargeable batteries.

Internal VN nanoparticles trap lithium polysulphides (LiPSs) and catalyse them transforming from long-chain to short-chain species; whereas the external cladding layers of graphene nanosheets confine the transformations in a nanoscale-catalysis reactors. VN/S@G cathode exhibits excellent long-cycling life at 2 C rate during the 2000 cycles, corresponding to 0.038 percent of capacity fade per cycle. According to in-situ Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies, VN catalyst accelerates chemical transformations of liquid-state LiPSs to solid-state Li2S2/Li2S and graphene intensifies Li+ diffusion behaviour. Improvement of electrochemical performance of the VN/S@G cathode depends on a coefficient of physical and chemical interactions between VN catalyst and LiPSs species.

Despite the great road to market, Li-S batteries still suffer from low practical energy density, which is intimately related to fundamental scientific and technological issues of sulfur cathodes. As a non-negligible parameter in sulfur cathodes, the compaction density plays a crucial role in the energy density of Li-S batteries. Herein, the effect of compaction density of sulfur/carbon cathodes on the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries is investigated. It is demonstrated that sulfur/carbon cathodes with an optimized compaction density of 1.2 g cm(-3) not only can guarantee the good contact of active materials, but can also ensure the rational dosage of electrolyte, thereby increasing the sulfur utilization as well as reducing the dissolution of polysulfide into the electrolyte. As a result, the pouch cells paired with the sulfur/carbon cathode and Li metal anode deliver superior specific capacity and remarkable cycling performance, which is attributable to the better contact between particles and the faster redox kinetics. This work reveals the contribution of the compaction density of the sulfur cathode to the electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery, providing an instructive paradigm for the rational design of an advanced sulfur cathode for large-scale commercialized Li-S pouch cells.

Bromomethylation of high-surface area carbons as a versatile synthon: adjusting the electrode-electrolyte interface in lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ORDERED MESOPOROUS CARBON; ACTIVATED CARBON; NITRIC-ACID; FUNCTIONALIZATION; CHEMISTRY; ADSORPTION; ATTACHMENT; REDUCTION; MOLECULES; LAYERS	A two-step procedure for the surface functionalization of carbon materials has been developed. In the first step, mesoporous carbon (CMK3), carbon black (XC-72R Vulcan), and activated carbon (AC) are bromomethylated efficiently under mild conditions using commercially available reagents, resulting in reproducible surface bromine loadings, the concentrations of which correlate to the carbon's surface area. The resulting bromomethylated materials display excellent stability over the course of months when stored under ambient conditions. In the second step, substitution reactions with a variety of nucleophiles proceed efficiently. Example nucleophiles include azide, amines, ammonia and iodide, and exhibit high conversion yields. To demonstrate the application of this two-step functionalization method, bromomethylated CMK3, Br-CMK3, was reacted with ethylenediamine (EN) to form EN-CMK3, which was used as the conductive host for the sulfur cathode in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Impregnation of EN-CMK3 with a lithium polysulfide-containing electrolyte with either lithium nitrate (LiNO3) or lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the supporting electrolyte increases the battery performance relative to pristine CMK3. With LiNO3, the surface-bonded EN allows for increased sulfur use and results in higher capacities of ca. 300 mA h g(-1); with LiTFSI, the EN groups attenuate the polysulfide shuttle (LiPS shuttle) and the initial charging efficiency (ICE) is increased substantially from 3% to 73%. These results provide a proof-of-principle of the versatility of bromomethylated carbons as a useful starting material for a variety of functional materials.

The results of cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the TiO2-S-CA cathode was highly stable. Further, the results of galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements demonstrated that the capacity retention of a Li-S cell based on this cathode at the end of 100 cycles was 71 % of the initial capacity; in contrast, that of cell based on a S-CA cathode was only 43.9 %. On the basis of these result, various factors for improving the cycling life of cells based on this TiO2-S-CA cathode are discussed. Furthermore, the cell with the TiO2-S-CA cathode exhibited robustness and a high degree of reversibility at different discharge rates. Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed at different discharge states in order to study the effects of the microstructure of the composite cathode on its electrochemical performance.

Li-S batteries with the SIL electrolyte showed good cycle stability and Coulombic efficiency; however, the actual energy density of preliminary tested cells was much lower than the theoretical value due to the low sulfur loading and excess electrolyte. In this study, we employed Al foam sheets as the cathode current collector in order to three-dimensionally collect the current, which resulted in increased sulfur loading and enabled us to control the cathode porosity by mechanically pressing the Al foam sheets. High sulfur loading on the cathodes (up to 6 mg(-sulfur) cm(-2)) was achieved with an initial discharge capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1). Simultaneously, in order to reduce the amount of electrolyte, the cathode porosity was controlled; the discharge capacity in the SIL electrolyte was maintained at similar to 1000 mAh g(-1) when the cathode porosity was no less than 30%. At sufficiently high porosity, the discharge capacity was independent of the electrolyte amount and was 1000 mAh g(-1) for electrolyte volume/total void volume ratios higher than 3 in a coin cell configuration.

MgS was added to Li2S (Li2-2xMgxS) using the planetary ball milling method. No trace of MgS was detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with x <= 0.05. Improvement of the ionic conductivity upon addition of MgS was observed even in the samples with 0.05 <= x <= 0.2, where the remaining MgS was detected by XRD analysis. Vacancy formation and the nanoionic effect were the governing factors for Li+ conduction. Stabilization of the cycle capacity was also achieved in the cell containing Li1.2Mg0.15S when compared with that employing bare Li2S as the electrode active material. Improvement of the ionic conductivity by approximately 2 orders of magnitude at 90 degrees C was obtained with x=0.15 compared with that with x=0. In addition, the charge-discharge capacities of the cell with x= 0.15 were stable up to 50 cycles, while the cell with x= 0 began to degrade after the 25th cycle.

In this strategy, the interior oil emulsion droplets serve as soft templates to form pores to accommodate sulfur and the hydrophilic GCN stacks around oil droplets to assemble into a crosslinked 3D network. Through this microemulsion encapsulation route, S/GCN cathodes with a sulfur loading as high as 82 wt% can be achieved. Furthermore, the enriched N-sites in GCN macropores offer numerous adhesion sites for polysulfides, realizing a "physical-chemical" dual-confinement for polysulfides from diffusion. Moreover, the robust and highly porous 3D graphene frameworks render efficient electron/Li+ transport pathways for fast kinetics as well as good structure integrity. Consequently, in comparison to the conventional G-sponge/Li2Sn catholyte system, S/GCN delivers a higher specific capacity, superior high-rate capability (612 mA h g(-1) at 10 C), and alleviated anode corrosion issues. Particularly, an energy density as high as 1493 W h kg(-1) (calculated on the total weight of the cathode) and an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.017% per cycle over 800 cycles at 0.3 C are achieved.

Li2S growth on graphene: Impact on the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; HIGH-ENERGY-DENSITY; DOPED GRAPHENE; ELECTROLYTES; CATHODES; ANODE; ADSORPTION; NUCLEATION; REDUCTION; MECHANISM	Lithium-sulfur batteries show remarkable potential for energy storage applications due to their high-specific capacity and the low cost of active materials, especially sulfur. However, whereas there is a consensus about the use of lithium metal as the negative electrode, there is not a clear and widely accepted architectural design for the positive electrode of sulfur batteries. The difficulties arise when trying to find a balance between high-surface-area architectures and practical utilization of the sulfur content. Intensive understanding of the interfacial mechanisms becomes then crucial to design optimized carbon-hosted sulfur architectures with enhanced electrochemical performance. In this work, we use density functional theory (DFT)-based first principles calculations to describe and characterize the growing mechanisms of Li2S active material on graphene, taken as an example of a nonencapsulated carbon host for the positive electrode of Li-S batteries. We first unravel the two growing mechanisms of Li2S supported nanostructures, which explain recent experimental findings on real-time monitoring of interfacial deposition of lithium sulfides during discharge, obtained by means of in situ atomic force microscopy. Then, using a combination of mathematical tools and DFT calculations, we obtain the first cycle voltage plot, explaining the three different regions observed that ultimately lead to the formation of high-order polysulfides upon charge. Finally, we show how the different Li2S supported nanostructures can be characterized in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Altogether, this work provides useful insights for the rational design of new carbon-hosted sulfur architectures with optimized characteristics for the positive electrode of lithium-sulfur batteries.

In this presented study, bamboo-derived hierarchical porous carbon (BDPC) was adopted as a conducting substrate for containing S. Soft polystyrene (PS) and polyaniline (PANI), were prepared as coating layers. The main purpose is to figure out the specific roles that the polymer shells and the heteroatoms doped on polymer backbone play during cycles. The ternary products were characterized by structural analysis and electrochemical testing. The results indicate that, as compared to BDPC/S, the PS@BDPC/S electrode displays higher capacity retention during long-term cycles, especially at the high current rate. It is attributed to the integrated coating shell, which provides physical confinement and reserves spaces for restraining volume expansion. It is noted that the PANI@BDPC/S electrode presents a higher initial capacity, remarkable long-life performance, and excellent rate property. The outstanding performances are closely related to the nitrogen atom doped on PANI backbone, they provide not just abundant polar conducting sites for fast electron/Li-ion transport but strong chemical anchoring for restricting the migration of polysulfides. Therefore, our study poses a clearer understanding of the functionalized polymers used in Li-S battery.

Herein, a stable flexible current collector, composed of ultralong MnO2 nanowires and expanded graphite nanosheets (MnO2 NW/EG) with high electronic conductivity, is combined with Li2S6 to serve as a self-supporting cathode in Li-S batteries, in which the maximum loading mass of sulfur can be regulated to 7 mg cm-2, the ultralong MnO2 nanowires has the ability to accelerate the adsorption and catalytic conversion of LiPSs through the chemical action of the polar active surface and the good mechanical flexibility caused by the introduction of ultralong nanowires and nanosheets can buffer the large volume expansion of sulfur during charging/discharging. Moreover, Li-S batteries with MnO2 NW/EG current collector still maintain a high capacity of 538 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles at 1 C and the capacity decay is only 1.2 mAh g-1 per cycle, even when the sulfur loading is 7 mg cm-2, the capacity can be as high as 2.5 mAh cm-2, indicating a practical application ability.

Herein, a novel FeS2-embedded N-doped carbon (FeS2-NC) nanocage is reported as a separator coating material to alleviate these problems. It is also for the first time that FeS2 is applied to the separator coating of LSBs. The yolk-pleat-shell structure of FeS2-NC was synthesized via the pyrolysis of iron complexes prepared by Schiff base condensation and subsequent sulfurization treatment. The large internal space of FeS2-NC not only physically confines LiPSs but also forms a highspeed electron-ion transport network in cooperation with the highly polar compound FeS2, providing abundant chemical adsorption and catalytic sites for fast conversions of LiPSs. Theoretical calculation further confirms that FeS2 has strong adsorption energy for both Li2S6 and Li2S8, while in-situ Raman analysis also reveals the interaction between FeS2 and LiPSs. In addition, coin cells with the light functional separator (coating loading: 0.2 mg cm(-2)) have a ultrahigh initial capacity of 1613.6 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and a satisfactory cyclability of 652.3 mAh g(-1) at 1C over 600 cycles with an attenuation rate of 0.049% per cycle.

However, the commercialization of Li-S batteries is hindered by the shuttle effect of polysulfides, the low electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode and a large volume expansion during lithiation. Herein, we predict a new two dimensional sp(2) hybridized carbon allotrope (PHE-graphene) and prove its thermodynamic and kinetic stability. If it is utilized to encapsulate the cathode of Li-S batteries, not only will the shuttle effect be avoided but also the electronic conductivity of the sulfur cathode will be improved significantly owing to its metallic electronic band structure. The thermal conductivity of PHE-graphene was found to be very high and even comparable with graphene, which is helpful for the heat dissipation of cathodes. In addition, PHE-graphene also exhibited superior mechanical properties including ideal tensile strength and in-plane stiffness.

To date, sulfur materials have been generally synthesized by a sublimation technique in sealed containers. This is a well-developed technique for the synthesizing of well-ordered sulfur materials, but it is limited when used to scale up synthetic procedures for practical applications. In this study, we suggest an easily scalable, room-temperature/ambient-pressure chemical pathway for the synthesis of highly functioning cathode materials using electrostatically assembled, amine-terminated carbon materials. It is demonstrated that stable cycling performance outcomes are achievable with a capacity of 730 mAhg(-1) at a current density of 1 C with good cycling stability by a virtue of the characteristic chemical/physical properties (a high conductivity for efficient charge conduction and the presence of a number of amine groups that can interact with sulfur atoms during electrochemical reactions) of composite materials. The critical roles of conductive carbon moieties and amine functional groups inside composite materials are clarified with combinatorial analyses by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Enhancing the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries by anchoring polar polymers on the surface of sulfur host materials	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							HOLLOW CARBON NANOFIBERS; REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; LI-S BATTERIES; CYCLE LIFE; CATHODES; COMPOSITES; INTERLAYER; NANOSHEETS; PROSPECTS; NANOCRYSTALS	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are attracting intense interest due to their high theoretical energy density and relatively low cost, but their practical applications are still hindered by quick capacity decay owing to the polysulfide shuttle effect. Based on the first-principles calculations, it has been found that the oxygencontaining functional groups (hydroxyl and ether group) of Triton X-100 are able to carry out effective trapping of lithium polysulfides by strong Li-O interactions, demonstrating a feasible strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect. Therefore, herein we present a facile and scalable synthetic route to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect and further improve the overall performance of Li-S batteries through anchoring inherently polar polymer Triton X-100 on the surface of carbon materials. The results show that the MAC/S composite delivers a high discharge capacity of 1432 mA h g(-1) in the first cycle, a capacity retention of 76% after 50 cycles at a rate of 0.2C with an excellent coulombic efficiency of 95% and a reversible specific capacity of above 889 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a rate of 0.5C with a low capacity decay of 0.3% per cycle.

Co-MOF-74@MWCNT was synthesized using a solvothermal method. The fabrication of Co-MOF-74@MWCNT was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller testing. The interlayer was fabricated using a filtration method. Assembled batteries were prepared using a CoMOF-74@MWCNT interlayer and an MWCNT interlayer and subsequently investigated via cyclic voltammetry tests. Co-MOF-74 promotes a redox reaction and shows a small peak at 1.85 V. A symmetric and full cell test revealed that the Co-MOF-74@MWCNT cell enables a faster redox reaction and higher capacity than that of the MWCNT cell. After 15 cycles, the Co-MOF-74@MWCNT cell achieved a value of 1112 mAh g(-1), which is 26% greater than that of the MWCNT cell (880 mAh g(-1)) at 0.2C. Voltage profile testing showed that the reason for the higher capacity of the Co-MOF-74@MWCNT cell is that it promotes the conversion of Li2S2 to Li2S. Various electrochemical analyses confirmed that the Co-MOF-74@MWCNT interlayer acts not only as a physical and chemical barrier but also promotes the transformation of Li2S2 to Li2S.

The functional separator in the Li-S battery has the potential to provide the perfect solution to these problems. Herein a triple-layer multifunctional PVDF-based nanofiber separator, which contains GoTiN/PVDF layer on the top and bottom and ZnTPP/PVDF layer on the middle, is designed. The polarity and porous structure of this multifunctional separator can greatly improve the wettability of electrolytes and enhance the transportation of Li+. With the zinc-based porphyrin framework (ZnTPP) structure, this separator has a strong chemisorption and LiPS conversion ability, which greatly prevent the 'shuttle effect'. Consequently, the designed multilayer separator showed excellent electrochemical performance. As a result, the cell with GoTiN@ZnTPP@GoTiN nanofiber membrane dis- played an initial discharge capacity of 1180 mAh/g with a benign capacity retention of 65.9% at 0.5C and high coulombic efficiency of more than 98.5% after 100 cycles. Even at 2C, it can still release a capacity of 798 mAh/g. Moreover, the remarkable capacity of 591 mAh/g could be achieved with a high sulfur load of 5.76 mg/cm(2) under a current density of 0.1C. Based on these merits, this novel and scalable multifunctional separator is a promising candidate to replace the conventional PP separator for advanced Li-S batteries to deal with various challenges.

Based on the experimental results of metal sulfides (FeS and SnS2), we find that the MBD method gives a more accurate prediction of anchoring mechanism compared with other van der Waals (vdW) inclusive methods. We systematically investigate the anchoring mechanism of two prototypal anchoring materials-Ti2CF2 and doped-graphene systems. The many-body effect is found to play an important role on the reduction of anchoring behaviors, especially when the systems have large polarization and the vdW interactions predominate the anchoring behavior. Our work deepens the fundamental understanding of the anchoring mechanism, and provides a more accurate criterion for screening anchoring materials for suppressing the shuttle effect.

Notably, an a-Ti3C2 MNR framework with open interconnected macropores and an exposed surface area guarantees high S loading and fast ionic diffusion for prompt lithiation/delithiation kinetics, and the 2D d-Ti3C2 MXene interlayer remarkably prevents the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides via both chemical absorption and physical blocking. As a result, the integrated a-Ti3C2-S/d-Ti3C2/PP electrode was directly used for Li-S batteries, without the requirement of a metal current collector, and exhibited a high reversible capacity of 1062 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and enhanced capacity of 632 mAh g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.5 C, outperforming the a-Ti3C2-S/PP electrode (547 mAh g(-1)) and conventional a-Ti3C2-S on an Al current collector (a-Ti3C2-S/Al) (597 mAh g(-1)). Furthermore, the all-MXene-based integrated cathode displayed outstanding rate capacity of 288 mAh g(-1) at 10 C and long-life cyclability. Therefore, this proposed strategy of constructing an all-MXene-based cathode can be readily extended to assemble a large number of MXene-derived materials, from a group of 60+ MAX phases, for applications such as various batteries and supercapacitors.

Zeta potential tests, differential scanning calorimetry analysis and calculations of the rotational barriers of the links of the polymer chains by General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System (GAMESS) reveal that higher charge densities and better chain flexibility of the binders promise the dispersion of the downsized cathode materials. LA132 is found to have optimal characteristic for dispersing and stabilizing the cathode materials in aqueous environment. The cycling performance and SEM images of the cathodes demonstrate that cathodes with higher dispersion degree achieve higher discharge capacities. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results further support that better dispersed cathodes have lower impedance resulting from their well established conducting frameworks.

However, the poor electronic conductivity of sulfur and the dissolution of lithium polysulfide intermediates lead to the low practical capacity and the fast capacity decay of sulfur cathode. Herein, we report a hybrid electrode design based on titanium carbide nanoparticles (TiC NPs) attached to carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to improve the sulfur cathode performance via the synergistic effect of the strong binding of TiC NPs and the high conductivity of CNFs. The TiC NPs-CNFs hybrid electrode provides both a high electron transfer pathway and deposition active sites for sulfur species, and thus largely enhances the cycling stability and rate performance of the sulfur cathode. This hybrid electrode material will have a great potential application in future Li-S batteries due to its facile preparation and high efficiency.

Lightweight Metallic MgB2 Mediates Polysulfide Redox and Promises High-Energy-Density Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOULE			English	Article							HIGH-PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; BORON	The lithium-sulfur battery, despite possessing high theoretical specific energy, faces practical challenges of polysulfide shuttling and low cell-level energy density and hence requires significant functional advances over porous carbon for the cathode host. Here we report the lightweight superconductor MgB2-whose average mass/atom is comparable with carbon-as a metallic sulfur host that fulfills both electron conduction and polysulfide immobilization properties. We show by means of first-principles calculations that borides are unique in that both B-and Mg-terminated surfaces bond exclusively with the S-x(2-) anions (not Li+), and hence enhance electron transfer to the active S-x(2-) ions. The surface-mediated polysulfide redox behavior results in a much higher exchange current in comparison with MgO and carbon. By sandwiching MgB2 nanoparticles between graphene nanosheets to form a high-surface-area composite structure, we demonstrate sulfur cathodes that achieve stable cycling at a high sulfur loading of 9.3 mg cm(-2).

The nanocomposite, synthesized by a chemical reaction-deposition approach followed by low temperature thermal treatment, is composed of a thin and uniform sulfur film anchored on a graphene oxide (GO) sheet. The GO is partially reduced during the chemical synthesis process, resulting in the appearance of a C-H bond and an increase in the ordering of GO sheets. The moderate chemical interactions between sulfur and GO can preserve the intrinsic electronic structure of GO, and on the other hand, immobilize the sulfur on the GO sheets, which should be responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance of the lithium-sulfur cells by using the GO-S nanocomposite as the cathode material.

One of the major unsolved issues is the complex diffusion of lithium polysulfide intermediates, which in combination with the subsequent paradox reactions is known as the shuttle effect. Nanocarbon with homogeneous nonpolar surface served as scaffolding materials in sulfur cathode basically cannot afford a sufficient binding and confining effect to maintain lithium polysulfides within the cathode. Herein, a systematical density functional theory calculation of various heteroatoms-doped nanocarbon materials is conducted to elaborate the mechanism and guide the future screening and rational design of Li-S cathode for better performance. It is proved that the chemical modification using N or O dopant significantly enhances the interaction between the carbon hosts and the polysulfide guests via dipole-dipole electrostatic interaction and thereby effectively prevents shuttle of polysulfides, allowing high capacity and high coulombic efficiency. By contrast, the introduction of B, F, S, P, and Cl monodopants into carbon matrix is unsatisfactory. To achieve the strong-couple effect toward Li2Sx, the principles for rational design of doped carbon scaffolds in Li-S batteries to achieve a strong electrostatic dipole-dipole interaction are proposed. An implicit volcano plot is obtained to describe the dependence of binding energies on electronegativity of dopants. Moreover, the codoping strategy is predicted to achieve even stronger interfacial interaction to trap lithium polysulfides.

We report a rationally designed Li-S cathode, which consists of a freestanding composite thin film assembled from S nanoparticles, reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and a multifunctional additive poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide) (PAQS). The S nanopartides provide a high initial specific capacity, and the layered and porous rGO structure provides electron and ion transport paths and restricts polysulfide shuttling. PAQS is not only a highly efficient sulfide trapping agent but also an excellent Li+ conductor, which benefits the battery reaction kinetics at a high rate.

The 3D-NG-sulfur composite (3D-NGS) with a high sulfur content of 87.6 wt% was synthesized via a facile one-pot solution method and sulfur was well dispersed within it. The as-designed 3D-NGS composite exhibits excellent rate capability and cyclability. The discharge specific capacity is 792 mA h g(-1) after 145 cycles at a current density of 600 mA g(-1) and the capacity fading rate is 0.05% per cycle. Even at a high rate of 1500 mA g(-1), the composite still shows a good cycle performance with a capacity of 671 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performance can be attributed to the flexible porous 3D structure and N-doping in graphene. The flexible 3D-NG can provide a conductive framework for electron transport and alleviate the volume effect during cycling. N-doping can facilitate the penetration of Li ions across the graphene and restrain sulfur due to the strong chemical bonding between S and the nearby N atoms.

Herein, a new porous organic polymer (POP) is synthesized and grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in situ to improve battery performance, which serves as an efficient polysulfide adsorber and catalytic promoter for polysulfide conversion. The polar POP shows strong chemisorption to polysulfides, which is confirmed by a series of calculations and experimental results. As a popular conductive substrate, rGO offers an electron transport channel for sulfur and polysulfide conversion. Due to the synergistic functions of composite materials, the batteries with POP@rGO modified separators retain a high specific capacity of 697.3 mA h g(-1) and a minimum capacity fading rate of 0.04% per cycle at 1C over 500 cycles. Besides, even at a high sulfur loading of 5 mg cm(-2), a high area capacity of 4.27 mA h cm(-2) can also be achieved, which shows that it has great potential in promoting the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries.

Using the prepared CN/S composite as the cathode material, a lithium sulfur battery was made from the cathode material. The initial discharge capacity of the CN/S battery reached 1116 mAh g(-1), the utilization ratio of sulfur was_73%, and the specific capacity was kept at 810 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. The electrochemical performance of the CN/S composite was significantly higher than that of the elemental sulfur.

Herein, ultrasmall Li2S (similar to 15 nm) is evenly deposited on a carbon nanotube (CNT) via a facile liquid-phase method to address these issues. The unique structure of the Li2S deposited on a CNT composite cathode can improve ionic/electronic conductivities of Li2S effectively and relieve the generated internal stress/strain during cycling. Specifically, the resultant Li/75%Li2S-24%P2S5-1% P2O5/Li10GeP2S12/Li2S-53%CNT ASSLSBs show a reversible capacity of 651.4 mAh g(-1) under 1.0C at 60 degrees C after 300 cycles and even at a much higher cathode load of 5.08 mg cm(-2), a high discharge capacity of 556 mAh g(-1) can still be obtained under 0.1C after 20 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performances are also attributed to the high diffusion coefficient of Li2S-53%CNT, which is 39 times that of pristine Li2S. This work presents an efficient procedure to design cathode materials with high ionic/electronic conductivities and paves the way for the successful commercialization of high-rate ASSLSBs.

The maximum specific surface area of 3334 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 2.17 cm(3) g(-1) are obtained for the material which is pre-carbonized at 500 degrees C and treated with a KOH/char mass ratio of 4 (a-MSs-500-4).

Herein, it is demonstrated that carbon nanofibers (CNFs) grown in situ on a nickel foam (CNF@Ni) can locally change the Li stripping/plating behavior by reducing the nucleation overpotential and regulating the electric field distribution. The 3D conductive hairy foam with a hierarchical structure can provide sufficient active sites for lithium nucleation. In addition, the numerous CNFs with protuberant tips can act as the charge centers and significantly increase the electrochemically active surface area, resulting in the locally reduced and uniformly distributed current density. The symmetric cells using CNF@Ni-Li electrodes can achieve ultralong lifespan with low voltage hysteresis up to 1000 h. More remarkably, the CNF@Ni hairy foam can simultaneously enable reliable sulfur electrochemistry. The corresponding Li-S full cell shows excellent cycle stability with a high capacity of approximate to 400 mAh g(-1)at 5 C after 800 cycles. This work provides an exemplary way to concurrently address the challenges in lithium and sulfur electrodes toward the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

To tackle this problem, a novel French fries-like hierarchical porous carbon (FLHPC) with a one-dimensional (1D) structure was constructed by carbonizing an aluminum metal-organic framework (Al-MOF). In FLHPC, sulfur was infiltrated mainly into the micro- and mesopores, while macro-pores were used to facilitate the transportation of Li ions (Li+). On the basis of this concept, even without LiNO3 as additive, Li-S batteries not only delivered a high initial discharge capacity of nearly 1200 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C (1 C = 1672 mA h g(-1)) but also showed good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 68% at 0.5 C after 200 cycles. In addition, when the capacity rate (C-rate) was increased to 2 C, a high discharge capacity of 763 mA h g(-1) was obtained after 20 cycles, proving their excellent C-rate performance.

Besides the advanced sulfur cathode, various functional separators/interlayers are also being developed as the effective inhibitor of polysulfide diffusion. In this study, Co(OH)(2)-anchored carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with Ketjen black (KB) dispersed in the void were designed as a dense net-like structure (denoted as Co(OH)(2)@CNF/KB), which was coated at the surface of a typical commercial separator to help inhibit polysulfide migration. It was demonstrated that the Co(OH)(2)@CNF/KB-modified separator could effectively increase the charge transfer of the cathode material, trap the dissolved polysulfides, and help to reuse the sequestered active material. As a result, the cell employing this functionalized separator and unmodified sulfur-based electrode exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1394 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, which converts to 84% utilization of sulfur, and a capacity decay of 0.10% per cycle at 2 degrees C for over 450 cycles. The unique design of Co(OH)(2)@CNF/KB provides a promising modifying approach for future lithium batteries.

Here, we report a simple ball-milling technique to combine both the physical and chemical routes into a one-step process for low-cost, scalable, and eco-friendly production of graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) edge-functionalized with sulfur (S-GnPs) as highly efficient LSB cathode materials of practical significance. LSBs based on the S-GnP cathode materials, produced by ball-milling 70 wt % sulfur and 30 wt % graphite, delivered a high initial reversible capacity of 1265.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C in the voltage range of 1.5-3.0 V with an excellent rate capability, followed by a high reversible capacity of 966.1 mAh g(-1) at 2 C with a low capacity decay rate of 0.099% per cycle over 500 cycles, outperformed the current state-of-the-art cathode materials for LSBs. The observed excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to a 3D "sandwich-like" structure of S-GnPs with an enhanced ionic conductivity and lithium insertion/extraction capacity during the discharge-charge process. Furthermore, a low-cost porous carbon paper pyrolyzed from common filter paper was inserted between the 0.7S-0.3GnP electrode and porous polypropylene film separator to reduce/eliminate the dissolution of physically adsorbed polysulfide into the electrolyte and subsequent cross-deposition on the anode, leading to further improved capacity and cycling stability.

Here, we used a double-effect strategy to improve the cycle stability and specific capacity of LSBs. That is, the hole effect with the alteration of the pore size of the mesoporous carbon spheres (MCS) as the cathode host materials, and the confinement effect with the usage of the carbon cloth (CC) as an intermediate layer in the middle of cathode and separator to inhibit the polysulfides diffusion and shuttle phenomenon. As a result, appropriate pore size and inner space were obtained by controlling the content of ammonium hydroxide solution (NH3 center dot H2O) catalyst to 1000 mu L (denoted as MCS-4) in the synthesis of MCS. When MCS-4 is used as the sulfur host material, the obtained electrode material with a CC interlayer modification showed distinguished electrochemical performance in cells, including a high initial discharge capacity (1250 mAh g(-1 )at 0.1 C) and long cycle stability (510 mAh g(-1) at 2 C after 500 cycles and 507 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C after 1000 cycles).

Homogeneous redox mediators (RMs) are effective promotors to propel the sulfur redox kinetics. However, most of the RMs only focus on a single reaction process. Herein, a strategy of mixed redox mediators (mixed-RM) is proposed for full-range redox mediation on the sulfur redox kinetics in working Li-S batteries. Concretely, one of the mixed-RM mainly mediates the liquid-solid reduction from polysulfides (LiPSs) to Li2S during discharge, while the other aims to promote the solid-liquid conversion from Li2S to LiPSs and the liquid-solid conversion from LiPSs to 5 during charge. Consequently, 2.5 Ah Li-S pouch cells with the mixed-RM achieve an actual initial energy density of 354 Wh kg alongside stable 20 cycles. This work provides an effective strategy on promoting the sulfur redox kinetics for high-energy-density Li-S batteries and inspires rational combination of novel functional molecules for practical energy storage systems.

Despite the positive aspect, lithium-sulfur batteries have suffered from severe capacity fading and limited rate capability. Here we report facile large-scale synthesis of a class of organosulfur compounds that could open a new chapter in designing cathode materials to advance lithium-sulfur battery technologies. Porous trithiocyanuric acid crystals are synthesized for use as a soft template, where the ring-opening polymerization of elemental sulfur takes place along the thiol surfaces to create three-dimensionally interconnected sulfur-rich phases. Our lithium-sulfur cells display discharge capacity of 945mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C with high-capacity retention of 92%, as well as lifetimes of 450 cycles. Particularly, the organized amine groups in the crystals increase Li+-ion transfer rate, affording a rate performance of 1210 mAhg (-1) at 0.1 C and 730mAhg(-1) at 5 C.

However, the insulating nature of sulfur and shuttle effect of polysulfides result in low sulfur utilization and rapid capacity decay. Here, sulfonated graphene is fabricated using the low-cost diluted sulfuric acid as sulfonated reagent, for constructing the freestanding sulfur cathode. It is confirmed that the sulfo groups grafted on graphene serve as mediators to react with long-chain polysulfides by forming the thiosulfate/ polythionate intermediates, and facilitate the conversion of long-chain polysulfides into short-chain species and solid discharge products. Crucially, the freestanding cathode with sulfur loading of 8.2 mg cm(-2) exhibits an areal capacity of 7.57 inA h cm(-2) and stable cycling over 100 cycles at 0.1 C.

Herein, we demonstrate a novel ordered structure based on ZnO nanoprism-arrays (ZnO NAs) in N-doped carbon foam nanoplates (NCFNs) threaded with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and its facile construction to successfully address the above-mentioned challenges. The as-designed ordered architectures can not only load a high content of sulfur (90 wt% for NCFN-MWCNTs), but also suppress polysulfide dissolution via the synergistic effect of the ZnO NAs and NCFNs. Specifically, the electrode based on NCFN-ZnO-MWCNTs with a 70 wt% loading of sulfur delivers an initial specific discharge capacity of 1249.4 mA h g(-1) at a 0.5C rate and shows exceptional reversible capacities of 1026.7, 887.5 and 698.6 mA h g(-1) at 1, 2 and 5C rates, respectively. Moreover, the electrode exhibits an ultra-low capacity fade rate of 0.032% per cycle during 500 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of over 99% at a 2C rate. We believe that this rational design of cathodes with unique ordered architectures and their scalable construction can provide an invaluable insight in the development of high-performance Li-S batteries for practical applications.

Their proper disposal is not only beneficial to the safety of biological systems but also useful to achieve considerable economic value. The first step of this study was to investigate the chemical composition of DMMs. It is primarily composed of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and iron, with fibrous polypropylene accounting for approximately 80% of the total weight. Then, DMMs were sulfonated and oxidised by the microwave-driven concentrated sulfuric acid within 8 min based on the fact that the concentrated sulfuric acid exhibits a good microwave absorption capacity. The co doping of sulfur and oxygen was achieved while improving the thermal stability of DMMs. Subsequently, the self activation pyrolysis of sulfonated and oxidised DMMs (P-SO@DMMs) was further realized in low-flow-rate argon. The specific surface area of P-SO@DMMs increased from 2.0 to 830.9 m(2).g(-1). P-SO@DMMs sulfur cathodes have promising electrochemical properties because of their porous structures and the synergistic effect of sulfur and oxygen co-doping. The capacity of the samples irradiated by microwave for 10 min at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 C were 1313.6, 1010.9, 816.5, 634.4, 513.4 and 453.1 mAh.g(-1) , respectively, and after returning to 0.2 C and continuing the cycle for 50 revolutions, maintained 50.5% of the initial capacity. After 400 cycles, its capacity is 38.1% of the initial capacity at 0.5 C. It is slightly higher than the electrochemical performance of the sample treated by microwave for 8 min and significantly higher than the sample treated by 6 min. This work converts structurally complex, biohazardous DMMs into porous carbon with high specific surface area by clean and efficient microwave solvothermal and self-activating pyrolysis, which facilitates the development of carbon based materials at low cost and large scale.

Practical application of Li-S batteries is hindered by shuttle effect of polysulfides and Li dendrites growth. Herein, a self-supporting cofunction host is constructed with 3D hierarchical graphene modified by N-doped nanoarrays, for both Li anode and S cathode to improve their performances simultaneously. Attributed to high conductivity, strong affinity, and optimized Li-ion transport pathway of N-doped nanoarrays, cofunction host provide excellent Li and S load, which facilitates uniform Li deposition and enhanced S conversion. Particularly, an extra graphene barrier is specialized for S cathode to inhibit the shuttle effect. As a result, Li anode shows long cycle life with outstanding Li-plating behavior, and S cathode shows high capacity and ultrahigh capacity retention with good immobilization of polysulfides. More importantly, the integrated Li-S battery shows long cycle stability and good flexibility, which is important for future application.

Sodium thiosulphate is used as a harmless activating agent, S dopant and sulfur precursor. The porous microspheres exhibit large surface areas (2060-2340 m(2) g(-1)) and adequate micro-mesoporosity. They also have a notable amount of sulfur heteroatoms (5-7 %) and high electronic conductivity (2.3-3.1 S cm(-1)). The compact organization and suitable porosity of the microspheres allow competitive values of volumetric capacitance to be achieved when used in supercapacitors operating in aqueous and organic electrolytes (130 and 64 F cm(-3), respectively), while maintaining good rate capability. In addition, the sulfur/spherical carbon composites with a sulfur content above 80 % are tested as cathode material in lithium-sulfur batteries, demonstrating high sulfur utilization, large values of volumetric capacity (768 mAh cm(-3)) and stable long-term cyclability (0.086 % capacity loss per cycle).

Here, a bifunctional positive electrode formed by growing layered molybdenum trioxide nanoflakes onto carbon paper is developed to address this issue, which exhibits not only strong binding ability to anchor polysulfides, but also efficient catalytic activity towards polysulfides redox reactions. As a result, the electrode developed in this work enables a lithium-sulfur battery to achieve an initial capacity of 1145 mAh g(-1) and a retention capacity of as high as 976 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of 99.54% at 1 C. By contrast, the battery with the pristine carbon paper electrode suffers from a severe capacity decay from the 1st cycle (655 mAh g(-1)) to the 1000th cycle (256 mAh g(-1)) with a low coulombic efficiency of 89.4%. More strikingly, even with a higher sulfur loading of 8 mg cm(-2), the lithium-sulfur battery with the molybdenum trioxide nanoflakes decorated carbon paper electrode still retains a high specific capacity of 581 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles. These great improvements reveal that molybdenum trioxide is a promising electrode material to realize the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the practical application of LSBs is hindered by the low sulfur utilization due to the insulation nature of sulfur, and by the serious capacity fading of sulfur cathode arising from "shuttle effect" of polysulfides during the discharge-charge process. Herein we design and fabricate a 3D structured sulfur cathode based on Li4Ti5O12 nanowire array (LTOWA) to address these issues. In this cathode, the 3D nanowire array structure can facilitate electron transport and provide satisfactory electrochemically active surface where electron and Li ions can meet with the sulfur for fast conversion reaction, ensuring the high sulfur utilization of cathode even with a large areal sulfur content; in addition, we also show, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses, that LTO can immobilize the migrating polysulfide intermediates via Ti-S bond more effectively than the conventionally used TiO2 (TO), which adsorbs polysulfide mainly through O-S bond. As a result, the LTOWA/sulfur composite cathode with a high sulfur loading (4mg cm(-2)) shows a high utilization of sulfur (1100 mAh g(-1) at 0.02C) and excellent cycle life (80% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1C, namely 0.06% per cycle). Our work suggests that the performance of polar oxide/sulfur composite cathodes can be further improved by the synergistic effect of more effective chemical bonds and architectural design.

J	Park, GD; Lee, JK; Kang, YC				Park, Gi Dae; Lee, Jung-Kul; Kang, Yun Chan			Electrochemical properties of sulfur-carbon hollow nanospheres with varied polar titanium oxide layer location for lithium-sulfur batteries	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						Li-S batteries; lithium polysulfide; polar material; porous and hollow carbon; titanium oxide	POROUS CARBON; HOST MATERIAL; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; CAPACITY; SPHERES; TIO2	Porous and graphitic carbon materials containing high amounts of sulfur are being actively studied for Li-S batteries on account of their diverse structural merits. However, the lithium polysulfides dissolution in the electrolyte during cycling is one of the obstacles in the practical application of Li-S batteries. Some strategies have been suggested to address this issue, including the physical confinement of nonporous structures or the use of polar materials. In addition, forming a polar coating layer over a sulfur-embedded carbon matrix is considered as a highly effective strategy. However, the arrangement of elemental sulfur, the porous carbon matrix, and polar materials in the composite cathode should be further optimized to minimize polysulfide dissolution during cycling. Here, ultrafine TiOx nanodots are uniformly deposited over active sulfur embedded within hollow porous carbon nanospheres by a simple and rapid impregnation process. Depending on the infiltration order of the TiOx precursor solution, different arrangements of ultrafine TiOx nanodots are formed in the carbon shell. The polar TiOx nanodots arranged in the outermost layer of HPCS-S efficiently block the diffusion of soluble polysulfides, which result in excellent cycle performance. The discharge capacity of the polar TiOx layer-coated sulfur-embedded hollow carbon nanospheres for the 500th cycle at 1.0 C (1675 mA g(-1)) is 630 mA h g(-1), and the specific capacity at 5.0 C is 513 mA h g(-1).

Herein, we present a novel sulfur-rich copolymer combination Poly(S-r-DIB)-g-PANI (SBPA) to address these chronic issues. Two organic compounds 1,3-diisopropylbenzene and p-aminostyrene are sequentially grafted to sulfur forming multiple crosslinking carbon-sulfur bonds; the amino group of p-aminostyrene then provides a site for aniline polymerization. The combination of the copolymer graftings create a novel structure of highly crosslinked copolymer chains with covalently grafted polyaniline. As cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, the sulfur has high specific capacity, impressive cycling stability, and good rate capability, i.e. 1089 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C after 160 cycles (similar to 84% retention) and 612 mAh g(-1) after 450 cycles at 0.5 C (similar to 73% retention). Compared to controls of sulfur/polyaniline mixtures or to non-aniline-reacted sulfur-copolymer, the polyaniline crosslinked copolymer has superior capacity retention and rate capability due to the unique combination of crosslinked sulfur and grafted polyaniline.

Herein, we demonstrate ultrathin nanosheet-assembled flowerlike NiSe2 architectures as highly efficient catalysts for SRRs. Such unique NiSe2 architectures are fabricated through a simple urea-assisted precipitation combined with a moderate selenylation process and can offer sufficient binding sites to chemically anchor polysulfides. In the meantime, kinetics test results demonstrate that the NiSe2 sample can effectively catalyze the polysulfide conversion and accelerate the Li2S precipitation and decomposition. When used as a separator modification material, the NiSe2 catalysts enable the sulfur cathode to realize a high capacity of 1280.7 mA h g(-1), high average Coulombic efficiency (similar to 98.9%), and good cycle stability. Furthermore, a freestanding carbon paper-supported sulfur cathode with 8.8 mg cm 92. loading exhibits a high areal capacity of 7.8 mA h cm(-2) with the electrolyte/sulfur of 6 mu L mg(-1). This work will inspire the development of high-efficiency catalysts based on structural engineering for high-energy Li-S batteries.

The mesoporous carbon/sulfur (MC/S) composite cathode exhibits a first cycle discharge specific capacity of 1355 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, and the utilization rate of active sulfur can reach 80.9%. Even after 500 cycles, the discharge specific capacity still remains at 496.9 mA h g(-1) when tested at 0.5C. Furthermore, the hollow groove structure present in the MC/S electrode provides a large number of active sites for electrochemical reactions. The prepared MC/S composite cathode not only has a high discharge specific capacity and good cycle stability, but also increases the energy density of the lithium-sulfur battery. Therefore, this preparation process of MC is more conducive to practical application.

However, the application of Li-S batteries remains challenging; mainly due to a lack of understanding of the complex chemical reactions and associated equilibria that occur in a working Li-S system. A new approach preparing graphene-based active cathode materials of Li-S battery with spatially confined lithium sulfides is reported. The starting graphene-embedded 2D-MoS2 was synthesized by a solvothermal method in organic solvents followed by the calcination of trapped organic solvent molecules at 800 degrees C to give graphene single sheets inside the 2D-MoS2 layers with 7 A distance (MoS2-Gr-32.51). Then, it was electrochemically reduced/lithiated at potential 0.01 V vs Li+/Li generating metallic molybdenum and lithium sulfides. As a result, the structure of MoS2 multi-layers collapsed. The graphene multi-layer (MLGraphene) was left behind and shut the lithium sulfides between the layers. The sizes of Li2Sn (n = 4-6) are bigger than the inter-layer distance of ML-Graphene, and the escape of sulfur/sulfides from the cathode into the electrolyte is physically blocked alleviating shuttle effects. The specific capacity of ML-Graphene/lithium sulfides cathode was high of 1209 mAh/g(Mos2-Gr) at 0.1 C (1 C = 670 mA/g). The ML-Graphene exhibited the remarkable lithium intercalation capability, and the theoretical calculation has been carried out to give 2231.4 mAh/g. Such high capacity was hybridized with the theoretical capacity of sulfur (1675 mAh/g), and the ML-Graphene composite with dichalcogenides (2D-MoS2) became a promising platform for the cathode of Li-S batteries.

However, the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics of polysulfide conversion are still key challenges for practical application. Herein, we designed hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes/ultrathin molybdenum disulfide nanosheets in a core-shell architecture (denoted as NC@MoS2) to alleviate the shuttle effect and propel redox reaction kinetics, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Both experimental investigations and theoretical studies reveal that MoS2 nanosheets can chemically immobilize lithium polysulfides and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides. Moreover, this unique core-shell architecture could facilitate rapid electrical transport and favorable electrolyte infiltration. We have demonstrated that the obtained S-NC@MoS2 cathodes exhibit excellent rate capability (516 mA h g(-1) at 5C) and superior cycle stability (only 0.049% capacity decay per cycle up to 1000 cycles at 2C). Remarkably, the composite cathode with a high sulfur loading of 3.6 mg cm(-2) still maintains high rate capability and stable cycling performance over 300 cycles.

However, significant capacity fading caused by the shuttle of soluble polysulfides from the cathode to the anode significantly hampers their practical application. Here, we designed a nano-MgO/acetylene black (AB) decorated functional separator to suppress the shuttle of polysulfide intermediates, which can remarkably improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. Nano-MgO with the aid of the AB conductive network exhibits superior adsorption to polysulfides due to the synergistic effect of excellent chemisorption and improved electron conductivity. The electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery highly depends on the relative amount of nano-MgO and AB in the composite coating on the separator. A battery with the optimal decorated separator (MgO-25 separator, nano-MgO and acetylene black in the weight ratio 1 : 3) exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1238 mA h g-1 with high coulombic efficiency (-97%) and retains a high capacity of 875 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. This study promotes the understanding of the synergistic effect of the polysulfide adsorbent and the conductive agent on the suppression of the shuttle effect, and provides a way to design polysulfide-blocking barriers for Li-S batteries.

Herein, a flexible Li-S battery architecture based on electrocatalyzed cathodes made of interfacial engineered TiC nanofibers and in situ grown vertical graphene are developed. Integrated 1D/2D heterostructured electrocatalysts are realized to enable highly improved Li+ and electron transportation together with significantly enhanced affinity to LiPS, which effectively accelerate the conversion kinetics between sulfur species, and thus induce homogeneous deposition of Li2S in the catalyzed cathodes. Consequently, highly active electro-electrocatalysts-based cells exhibit remarkable rate capability at 2C with a high specific capacity of 971 mAh g(-1). Even at ultra-high sulfur loading and low E/S ratio, the battery still delivers a high areal capacity of 9.1 mAh cm(-2), with a flexible pouch cell being demonstrated to power a LED array at different bending angles with a high capacity over 100 cycles. This work puts forward a novel pathway for the rational design of effective nanofiber electrocatalysts for cathodes of high-performance Li-S batteries.

To overcome these problems, we designed and hydrothermally synthesized a flower-like three-dimensional CoS/multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite as the sulfur host material. The CoS and MWCNTs were tightly joined by chemical bonds to form a stable composite structure. The polar and catalytic CoS can promote the redox process and reduce the dissolution of polysulfides, while the flexible carbon nanotubes can buffer the expansion/shrinkage of the electrode during charging and discharging. CoS/MWCNT-S displays an excellent specific capacity (1120 mAh g(-1), 0.1 C) and high capacity retention after 200 cycles (78%, 0.5 C).

However, the undesirable lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling and sluggish redox kinetics of sulfur electrochemistry severely degenerate the wide-ranging electrochemical performances, hindering the commercialization process of Li-S batteries. Herein, a Fe and V coordinated bimetallic oxide FeVO4 (denote FVO) nanocatalyst with three-dimensional (3D) ordered structure is thoughtfully tailored and cooperated with the commercialized carbon nanotubes (CNT) to modify polypropylene (PP) separator for achieving high efficiencies of restraining the LiPSs shuttling and boosting the redox conversion of sulfur species. The Fe and V coordinated bimetallic oxide demonstrates enhanced anchoring and catalyzing activities toward sulfur species than single metal oxides of Fe and V with homometallic valence states due to the reconfiguration of the 3d-band. Impressively, the Li-S pouch cell with the FVO/CNT@PP separator achieves an energy density up to 341 Wh kg(-1). The bimetallic oxide nanocatalyst used in this work enlightens a new designing route toward the separator modification for the development of high energy density Li-S batteries.

Both SiOCN-1 and SiOCN-5 composites, derived from formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde respectively, display similar bulky structure composed by aggregated nanospheres with a diameter of 70-100 nm. SiOCN-5 has a higher carbon content of 30.4% than 15.9% for SiOCN-1, while a lower specific surface area of 38.2 m(2) g(-1) than 76.0 m(2) g(-1) for SiOCN-1. SiOCN/S cathodes with sulfur loading of 1.2-1.5 mg cm(-2) were fabricated using SiOCN as sulfur host on different current collector of aluminum foil (AL) or carbon paper (CP). When using aluminum foil as current collector, SiOCN-5/S-AL cathode exhibits better electrochemical performance than SiOCN-1/S-AL, primarily due to the higher electrical conductivity of SiOCN-5 comparing with SiOCN-1. When using porous carbon paper as current collector, SiOCN-5/S-CP cathode shows the best cycling performance with a discharge capacity of 648.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles.

However, their widespread application is severely plagued by poor cycling stability, inferior rate capability and low coulombic efficiency, which are largely attributed to the shuttling effect of soluble polysulfides. Herein, we report an architecture of an N,P co-doped biological carbon-based covalent sulfur composite (NP@BCCSC), which acts as a cathode for highly robust Li-S batteries. The NP@BCCSC can not only buffer the volume expansion of sulfur during the charge/discharge process, but also shows strong absorption towards soluble polysulfides, which can effectively suppress the shuttling effect. As a cathode for Li-S batteries, the NP@BCCSC with a sulfur content of 20.1% exhibits a reversible capacity of 1190 mA h g(-1)(all specific capacities are calculated based on the mass of sulfur) at a current density of 500 mA g(-1)after 500 cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%. Moreover, the NP@BCCSC offers a highly robust cycling stability (an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.0024% per cycle during 15 000 consecutive cycles) and an excellent rate capability (high specific capacity of 920 mA h g(-1)even at a current density of 10 000 mA g(-1)), indicating its great potential for applications in future energy storage systems.

However, some key issues of cathode, for instance, the polysulfides confinement, low ion/electrons transfer and etc., hinder the practical utilization of LSBs. Herein, such issues could be carefully handled by using the conductive polypyrrole as polysulfides wrap-per. The polypyrrole with pyrrole rings can efficiently confine polysulfides inside cathode for redox. Meanwhile, the conductive polypyrrole with delocalized pi-electron cloud can facilitate electrons transfer. Besides, the addition of carbon nanotube (CNT) and oxidized graphene (GO) can enhance the conductiv-ity of cathode material. As a result, the Li2S/CNT/GO/PPy cathode delivers a cycling capacity of 525 mAh g(-1) with a low-capacity decay rate of 0.065 % cycle(-1) after 400 cycles. Therefore, the lithium-sulfur bat-tery with Li2S-based and PPy-wrapped cathode could reasonably be counted as a potential alternative of long-cycling Li-ion cells. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the serious polysulfide "shuttle effect", volume expansion effect and slow conversion reaction kinetics of Li-S batteries during the charge/discharge cycle process still need to be resolved urgently. Herein, we prepared a novel sulfur host of SnO2-decorated MoS2 hollow microspheres (SnO2-MoS2 HMSs). The unique hollow structure provides enough space to accommodate a large amount of sulfur and effectively adapts to its large volume expansion during charge and discharge process. On the other hand, the SnO2 nanoparticles that attached to the surface of the MoS2 nanosheets will accelerate the catalysis of MoS2 and enhance the bonding strength with the polysulfide intermediates through the S-Sn-O chemical bond, which further inhibits the shuttle effect. The newly synthesized SnO2 -MoS2 HMSs cathode has achieved excellent electrochemical performance. The initial discharge specific capacity of 1326.4 mAh g(-1) was obtained at 0.2 C, and after 100 cycles, the specific capacity of the SnO2-MoS2 HMSs/S cathode only decreased slightly to 1183.8 mAh g(-1), its capacity retention rate reaching as high as 89.2%. We expect the newly synthesized hollow structured MoS2 with SnO2 decoration provides a new strategy for the construction of Li-S battery cathode materials.

However, poor ionic/electronic conductivity and annoying shuttle effects still need to be resolved. Here a highly flexible and highly conductive MXene (Ti3C2Tx) interlayer with a sandwich structure is reported, the surface of which is a TiS2/TiO2 heterostructure formed by vulcanized. In this framework, the role of TiO2 nanoparticles is adsorbent to combine the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and the TiS2 nanoparticles function as catalysts to further facilitate the conversion of long-chain LiPSs to short-chain Li2S2/Li2S under the high conductivity of Ti3C2Tx. Furthermore, the interlayer can protect the Lithium metal anode by preventing polysulfide from depositing on the anode surface. Accordingly, the TOS/MX/TOS interlayer exhibits excellent performance with stable long-term cycling (approximate to 76.1% capacity retention with a decay rate of 0.048% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1C). This sandwiched interlayer with high discharge capacity and steady cycling performances is conducive to the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the conventional porous carbon used in cell with liquid electrolyte exhibits low efficiency in ASSLSBs because the immobile solid electrolyte (SE) cannot reach sulfur confined in the deep pores. The structure and distribution of pores in carbon highly impact the electrochemical performance of ASSLSBs. Herein, a N-doped carbon fiber with micropores located only at the surface with an ultrahigh surface area of 1519 m(2 )g(-1) is designed. As the porous layer is only on the surface, the sulfur hosted in the pores can effectively contact SE; meanwhile the dense core provides excellent electrical conductivity. Therefore, this structurally designed carbon fiber enhances both electron and ion accessibilities, promotes charge transfer, and thus dramatically improves the reaction kinetic in the ASSLSBs and boosts sulfur utilization. Compared to the vapor grown carbon fibers, the ASSLSBs using PAN-derived porous carbon fibers exhibit three times enhancement in the initial capacity of 1166 mAh g(-1) at C/20. An exceedingly cycling stability of 710 mAh g(-1) is maintained after 220 cycles at C/10, and satisfactory rate capability of 889 mAh g(-1) at C/2 is achieved.

The hybrid porous PIL membranes as the sacrificial template were prepared via ionic crosslinking of a cationic PIL with base-neutralized 1,1 '-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid, so that the iron source was molecularly incorporated into the template. The carbonization process was investigated in detail at different temperatures, and the chemical and porous structures of the carbon products were comprehensively analyzed. The Fe1-xS/N-PCMs prepared at 900 degrees C have a multimodal pore size distribution with a satisfactorily high surface area and well-dispersed iron sulfide nanoparticles to physically and chemically confine the LiPSs. The sulfur/Fe1-xS/N-PCM composites were then tested as electrodes in Li-S batteries, showing much improved capacity, rate performance and cycle stability, in comparison to iron sulfide-free, nitrogen-doped porous carbon membranes.

Many studies have focused on the cathode materials to improve the cell performance. In this work we present a series of poly (S-DVB) copolymers synthesised by inverse vulcanization of sulfur with divinylbenzene (DVB). The poly (S-DVB) cathode shows excellent cycling performances at C/2 and C/4 current rates, respectively. It was demonstrated poly (S-DVB) copolymer containing 20% DVB did not influence the electrochemical performance of the sulfur material, compared to elemental sulfur as high specific capacities over similar to 700 mAh g(-1) at 500 cycles were achieved at C/4 current rate, comparable to conventional carbon-based S cathodes. However, the use of copolymer network is assumed to act firstly as sulfur reservoir and secondly as mechanical stabilizer, enhancing significantly the cycling lifetime. The Li-poly (S-DVB) cell demonstrated an extremely low degradation rate of 0.04% per cycle achieving over 1600 cycles at C/2 current rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nonetheless, the existing issues of the serious shuttle effect and insulating property restrict their further applications. Herein, a honeycomb-like porous carbon derived from cotton is designed and prepared as a sulfur host to overcome the abovementioned problems. The cotton carbon carbonized at 700 degrees C acquires plentiful mesopores/macropores and displays a high surface area (458.85 m(2) g(-1)). The C/S composite shows a relatively high capacity of 1271 mAh g(-1) for the first cycle at 100 mA g(-1). The carbon treated at 600 degrees C possesses abundant carbon-oxygen groups, which is beneficial for chemical adsorption of soluble polysulfides. The high-sulfur-loading (74 wt %) C/S electrode exhibits long-span cycling stability over 200 cycles. Benefiting from the excellent conductivity of cross-linked carbon fibers and the unique porous structure for trapping sulfur as well as the polysulfides, the cotton C/S composites exhibit superior properties for advanced lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, their practical applications are prohibited by the sluggish charge transfer, the retarding Li ion diffusion, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides. We report here a high-performance cathode material in which a S submicrosphere with a mass fraction of 80% was encapsulated within a permeable Co(OH)(2) nanoshell which functions as a physical barrier preventing the sulfur and polysulfides from leaking into the electrolyte and also contributes to the catalytic decomposition of polysulfides during the charge and discharge process. When an interlayer of carbon nanofibers is introduced between the S@Co(OH)(2) cathode and the separator, the performance of the Li S batteries can be further significantly enhanced. Specifically, the S@Co(OH)(2) cathode possesses good cycling stability over 1000 cycles with an initial discharge capacity of 1100 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and a reversible capacity of 606 mAh g(-1). In particular, without the LiNO3 additive, this S@Co(OH)(2) cathode also exhibits a Coulombic efficiency as high as 85%, just a little lower than that of commercial electrolyte with LiNO3 additive. Relevant mechanistic studies revealed that such superior performances are attributed to the enhanced internal electrical and ionic conductivity and suppressed shuttling effect, owing to the presence of the Co(OH)(2) shell and the carbon-nanofiber interlayer. Theoretical simulations based on density functional theory were also carried out to figure out the interaction between the Co(OH)(2) nanosheets and the polysulfides. It revealed that the Co(OH)(2) nanoshell, rather than merely working as a physical barrier to trap the polysulfides, could also adsorb polysulfides and catalyze their decomposition during the cycling process, further helping to suppress the shuttling effect.

Here, we report a fluorinated covalent organic polymer (F-COP) as a template for high performance sulfur cathodes in Li-S batteries. The fluorination allowed facile covalent attachment of sulfur to a porous polymer framework via nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (SNAr), leading to high sulfur content, e.g., over 70 wt %. The F-COP framework was microporous with 72% of pores within three well-defined pore sizes, viz. 0.58, 1.19, and 1.68 nm, which effectively suppressed polysulfide dissolution via steric and electrostatic hindrance. As a result of the structural features of the F-COP, the resulting sulfur electrode exhibited high electrochemical performance of 1287.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.05C, 96.4% initial Columbic efficiency, 70.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5C, and robust operation for a sulfur loading of up to 4.1 mg(sulfur )cm(-2). Our findings suggest the F-COP family with the adaptability of SNAr chemistry and well-defined microporous structures as useful frameworks for highly sustainable sulfur electrodes in Li-S batteries.

Herein, we propose a universal strategy to synthesize monodisperse iron atom embedded nitrogen-doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (Fe-N/MHCS) as multi-effect nanoreactors for sulfur at the atomic level. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, the Fe-N-4 center is found to be an efficient electrocatalyst to propel the reversible conversion between LiPSs and Li2S, inhibit the LiPS shuttling and mediate the deposition of Li2S. As a result, S@Fe-N/MHCS exhibits significantly improved rate properties and cycling stability (only 0.0187% capacity fade in 1000 cycles at 1C) without using conductive carbon. Even at a practical high sulfur loading (5.4 mg cm(-2)) and low E/S ratio (8.0 mL mg(-1)), the areal capacity reaches 6.4 mA h cm(-2) and 81.7% of it is retained after 100 cycles. Furthermore, a S@Fe-N/MHCS pouch cell is also assembled showing exceptional cycling stability with a high capacity retention of 77.1% after 200 cycles. Therefore, this work provides valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of the catalysis mechanism for practical Li-S batteries with high specific energy and prolonged lifespan.

One of the main problems with Li-S batteries is that the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) easily decompose in the electrolyte which is known as the shuttle effect. Recently, the polypeptoid nanosheet crystal structure has been experimentally synthesized which is very useful for tremendous advances in soft material imaging as well as enabling to design biomimetic nanomaterials. Due to the very interesting properties of the polypeptoid material, we have investigated the electronic structure and charge-transfer mechanism for the lithium-sulfur batteries for the cathode material. The calculated adsorption energies of LiPSs on the surface of the polypeptoid material are in the range of -4.41 to -4.64 and -0.91 eV for the sulfur clusters. Also, the adsorption energies between the interaction of LiPSs and electrolytes (DME and DOL) are 0.75-0.89 eV. It means that the polypeptoid material could suppress the shuttle effect of LiPSs and significantly enhance the cycling performance of Li-S batteries. From these investigated results, the polypeptoid material will be a promising anchoring material for Li-S batteries.

The molecular-level dispersions of Fe3+ ions in carrageenan contribute to the ultra-high surface area of HPSCA after carbonization, acid washing and activation process. The attracting structure features make it an applicable candidate material in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries and double-layer supercapacitors (SCs). The highly developed porous structure of HPSCA can accommodate more sulfur (up to 80 wt%) to produce high-energy composite cathode with high specific capacity, cycle stability and long cycle life (400 cycles) in Li-S batteries. Meanwhile, HPSCA can present high specific capacitance of 335 and 217 F g(-1) (1 A g(-1)) in the aqueous and organic electrolyte. Superior rate performance also can be obtained, and high capacitance of 204 F g(-1) at 100 A g(-1) and 173 F g(-1) at 50 A g(-1) in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively, is retained.

Unfortunately, conventional commercially available polypropylene separators find it hard to meet this requirement due to their incapability of blocking polysulfide shuttling. Therefore, the development of a facile and scalable production of a new modified separator that can effectively regulate the shuttling of polysulfides will be very beneficial for the practical application of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, bismuth ferrite powder with spontaneous polarization is adopted to modify the separator owing to its special interaction with polysulfides. We develop a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize cubic-like bismuth ferrite particles of high purity, and apply them on the surface of the commercial separator with graphene oxide and a conductive agent. Our results show that the so-modified separator can effectively suppress the shuttling of polysulfides and then greatly improve the electrochemical properties of the lithium-sulfur battery in terms of cycle stability, rate performance, reaction kinetics, self-discharge behaviour and anode corrosion. Remarkably, our cell exhibits a high capacity density of 5.1 mA h cm(-2)at an ultra-high sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm(-2), which is higher than that of known commercial lithium ion batteries.

However, its commercialization still depends on the moderation of the shuttle effect and the conductivity improvement of the sulfur cathode. Herein, a novel reduced graphene oxide (rGO) wrapped yolk-shell vanadium dioxide (VO2) sphere hybrid host (rGO/VO2) is reported to simultaneously tackle these barriers. In particular, the polar VO2 sphere can chemically anchor and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides effectively both on the yolk and the shell surfaces. Meanwhile, the highly conductive 3D porous rGO network not only allows sufficient penetration of electrolyte and provides efficient transport pathways for lithium ions and electrons, but also buffers the volume variation during the lithiation process. Besides, the dissolution of the polysulfides can also be alleviated by physical confinement via the interconnected carbon network. Benefiting from these synergistic features, such designed rGO/VO2/S cathode delivers outstanding cycle stability (718.6 mA h g(-1) initially, and 516.1 mA h g(-1) over 400 cycles at 1C) with a fading rate of 0.07% per cycle. Even at 3C, a capacity of 639.7 mA h g(-1) is reached. This proposed unique structure could provide novel insights into high-energy batteries.

Herein, we report a yolk-shell structure with nickel disulfide nanoparticles encapsulated in the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown N-doped graphene (NG) nanoshell (termed as NiS2@NG). The synthesis process involves the growth of NG nanoshells simply by annealing Ni nanoparticles in soybean oil vapors without compressed gases, followed by solidstate sulfidation of partially etched Ni nanoparticles. Benefiting from both the physical and chemical confinement mechanisms, the NiS2@NG material exhibits exceptional lithium polysulfide (LiPS) trapping competence (even within a few seconds), as evidenced by visual adsorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The NiS2@NG cathode demonstrates excellent specific capacity (1213 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C current density), good rate capability (by retaining 782 mA h g(-1) capacity at 2C current density), and outstanding cycling stability (78% after 100 cycles at 0.5C current density). Moreover, a high sulfur content of 90% is realized with good cycling stability. Besides this, hollow NG nanoshells loaded with sulfur (NG@S) exhibited comparable electrochemical performance but bare NiS2 showed sluggish redox kinetics and poor electrochemical performance due to poor electrical conductivity and the absence of physical confinements. The findings of this study are strongly believed to open up pathways for the development of cathode materials for Li-S batteries.

This host possesses both micropores and mesopores, and inner wide cavities, which enable the sulfur to effectively immerse into the polyhedrons without obstacles and simultaneously restrict the escaping of polysulfides by outer carbon shell and abundant N sites. Hence, the polyhedron host combines the physical confinement and chemical interaction for polysulfides by virtue of the unique architecture. As a result, the hierarchically porous polyhedron enables a sulfur content of 72 wt% and achieves a faster polysulfide trapping and better electrochemical performance than the ZIF-8-derived microporous host at the sulfur loading of 1 and 5 mg cm(-2).

Recently, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, an unexpected cationic polymer strategy resulted in the capture of irreversible polysulfides, which greatly enhanced the Li-S cycling performance. The branched polyethylenimine (PEI) polymer with a high density of amine groups can trap lithium polysulfides through the interaction between -NH in the amine group and soluble Li2Sx. To boost this interaction, cationization was achieved through nucleophilic substitution with CH3I, where the cationic PEI (denoted as MPEII) exhibited enhanced affinity to polysulfides. MPEII attracted not only lithium polysulfide through Li-N and Li-I attraction, but also S-x(2-) by electrostatic attraction of the positively charged N after cationization. The cell with MPEII binder exhibited better performance than that with PEI in the self-discharge test. It also achieved a high S loading of 6.5 mg cm(-2) with high areal capacity of 6.48 mA h cm(-2) and consequent areal capacity of 985 mA h g(-1) after 10 cycles.

Herein, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and density functional theory (DFT) approaches are used to study the Li2S deposition behaviors on pristine and defected graphene substrates, including pyridinic N (PDN) doped and single vacancy (SV), as well as the interfacial characteristics, in that such defects could improve the polarity of the graphene material, which plays a vital role in the cathode. The result shows that due to the constraint of molecular vibration, Li2S molecules tend to form stable adsorption with PDN atoms and SV defects, followed by the nucleation of Li2S clusters on these sites. Moreover, the clusters are more likely to grow near these sites following a spherical pattern, while a lamellar pattern is favorable on pristine graphene substrates. It is also discovered that PDN atoms and SV defects provide atomic-level pathways for the electronic transfer within the Li2S-electrode interface, further improving the electrochemical performance of the Li-S battery. It is found for the first time that surface defects also have strong impacts on the deposition pattern of Li2S and provide electronic pathways simultaneously. Our work demonstrated the interior relationship between the surface defects in carbon substrates and the stability of Li2S precipitates, which is of high significance to understand the electrochemical kinetics and design Li-S battery with long cycle life.

The methods utilize Marangoni stresses produced by surfactants at a fluid/solid/gas interface and self-assembly of nanoparticles to facilitate rapid creation of ultrathin films of carbon, metal-oxide nanoparticles, polymers, and combinations of these materials on any non-reactive support in a layer-by-layer configuration. Using polyolefin separators in lithium sulfur electrochemical cells as an example, we illustrate how the method can be used to create structured membranes for regulating mass and charge transport. We further show that a layered MWCNT/SiO2/MWCNT nanomaterial created in a clip-like configuration, with gravimetric areal coverage of similar to 130 mu g cm(-2) and a thickness of similar to 3 mu m, efficiently intercept and reutilize dissolved lithium polysulfides for improving electrochemical performances of lithium sulfur batteries.

To significantly increase the energy density of state of the art batteries with silicon, new concepts have to be developed and electrode structuring will become a key technology. Structuring is essential to reduce the macroscopic and microscopic electrode deformation, caused by the volume change during cycling. We report pulsed laser structuring for the generation of hierarchical columnar silicon films with outstanding high areal capacities up to 7.5 mAh cm(-2) and good capacity retention. Unstructured columnar electrodes form a micron-sized block structure during the first cycle to compensate the volume expansion leading to macroscopic electrode deformation. At increased silicon loading, without additional structuring, pronounced distortion and the formation of cracks through the current collector causes cell failure. Pulsed laser ablation instead is demonstrated to avoid macroscopic electrode deformation by initial formation of the block structure. A full cell with lithiated silicon versus a carbon-sulfur cathode is assembled with only 15% overbalanced anode and low electrolyte amount (8 I mg(sulfur)(-1)). While the capacity retention over 50 cycles is identical to a cell with high excess lithium anode, the volumetric energy density could be increased by 30%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides severely hampers their practical application. The design of the sulfur cathode is one of the most important approaches to overcome the problem. In this work, MoS2 nanosheets have been successfully grown on the surface of hollow carbon spheres (HCS) to obtain MoS2@HCS nanocomposites with uniform morphology. The growth behavior of MoS2 nanosheets was also proved by adjusting the pore structure of HCS. With a sulfur loading of 74%, the MoS2@HCS/S cathode exhibits a high initial reversible capacity of 1419 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 C and remains at 1010 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. Even at 0.5 C, a capacity of 795 mA h g(-1) can be retained after 600 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention rate of 63.1%. By adjusting the concentration of the sulfur source, the relationship between different growth quantities of MoS2 and the cycling performance of the battery was also investigated. The excellent electrochemical performance of the MoS2@HCS/S cathode can be fully attributed to its physical and chemical double adsorption effect on lithium polysulfides, which has been confirmed through the visible adsorption and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) experiments. This work provides a simple design concept and method to synthesize a nanocomposite-based sulfur host for high performance lithium sulfur batteries.

Sulfur was uniformly coated on the surface of functional MWCNTs, which serves as a carbon matrix, to form a typical nanoscale core-shell structure with a sulfur layer of thickness 10-20 nm. Then the nanoscale sulfur intermediate composite was ball-milled to form interwoven and porous sphere architecture with large pores (around 1 mu m to 5 mu m). Different from most sulfur/carbon materials with micropore and mesopore structure, the micrometre scale S/MWCNT nanomicrosphere with a large pore structure could also exhibit high sulfur utilization and cycle retention. It could maintain a reversible capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.3 A g(-1) current density. And it even remained 780 m Lambda h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 Lambda g(-1) and 650 m Lambda h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 Lambda g(-1), showing a significant cyclability enhancement. It is believed that under the collective effect of hierarchical architecture, as well as the existence of carboxyl functional groups, sulfur/carbon materials with large pores could also exhibit an excellent electrochemical performance. The synthesis process introduced here is simple and broadly applicable, which would not only be beneficial to design new materials for lithium sulfur batteries but can also be extended to many different electrode materials for lithium ion batteries.

However, there are still many defects such as the shuttle effect of polysulfide, the non-conductivity of sulfur and the large volume change of sulfur cathode leading to cyclic decay and instability. To overcome these challenges, in this study, we synthesized the VS2 nano-flowers (NFs) through the hydrothermal method, and then took them as the sulfur host. The VS2 NFs possess unique hierarchical structure and excellent electrical conductivity, which can promote Li+ and charge transmission, thus improving the reaction kinetics. Besides, the VS2 has excellent chemical interaction with polysulfides, which can efficiently suppress the migration of polysulfides and inhibit the shuttle effect. It possessed better cyclic stability compared with the pure sulfur counterparts. Impressively, the lithium sulfur batteries (LSBs) with VS2/S (1:5) cathodes whose specific capacity decay rate over 200 cycles at 0.2 C was similar to 0.16% per cycle. It also greatly improved the sulfur utilization and the rate capability of LSBs. The above results demonstrate that the VS2 can enhance the cycling performance and has potential application in LSBs.

Borophene and defective borophene as potential anchoring materials for lithium-sulfur batteries: a first-principles study	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ANODE MATERIAL; ION BATTERY; CATHODE MATERIAL; DOPED GRAPHENE; HIGH-CAPACITY; CYCLE-LIFE; CARBON; OXIDE; POLYSULFIDES; PHOSPHORENE	Lacking effective anchoring materials to suppress the severe shuttle effect is a longstanding issue hindering the development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this work, a first-principles study is carried out to investigate the potential of borophene and defective borophene, which have high ionic conductivity and adsorbent ability, as anchoring materials for Li-S batteries. Borophene is found to exhibit ultra-high adsorption energies towards lithium polysulfides, but the material facilitates the decomposition of Li-S clusters, leading to an undesirable sulfur loss during battery cycling. For this reason, borophene is not an ideal anchoring material for Li-S batteries. On the contrary, defective borophene is found to show moderate adsorption energies ranging from 1 to 3 eV, which not only effectively anchors lithium polysulfides to suppress the shuttle effect, but also keeps their cyclic structures undecomposed. In addition, defective borophene exhibits a metallic characteristic during the whole reaction process, ensuring the lithium polysulfides be easily charged back and not accumulate on the anchoring materials. Given these advantages, it is expected that defective borophene is a promising anchoring material, leading to a suppressed shuttle effect and enhanced capacity retention for Li-S batteries.

This functional coated separator is designed to localize the polysulfides on the cathode side and act as an upper current collector for further utilization of sulfur while alleviating the ion conductivity decrease induced by the dissolved polysulfides in the discharge and charge process. Moreover, catalytic conversion of polysulfides by the solid state highly ionic conductor is observed. This brings significant improvement in battery specific capacity and cycling stability, with an initial discharge capacity of 1247 mA h g(-1) and a reversible capacity of 830 mA h g(-1) after 150 extended cycles at 0.5 C rate.

In this report, we designed a novel 3D conductive network structure (CNTs/Co-NC), which is composed of Co-NC (cobalt embedded in an N-doped porous carbon composite) derived from ZIF-67 polyhedra and inserted carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and applied it as a sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The CNT/Co-NC network structure is firstly prepared via the in situ nucleation of small ZIF-67 crystals on the surface of CNTs and eventually grown into CNT/ZIF-67 hybrid materials; after subsequent carbonization and infiltration of sulfur procedures, the S@CNT/Co-NC cathode is obtained. Li-S batteries based on the S@CNT/Co-NC cathode show an improved rate capability of 772.6 mA h g(-1) at the 2 C rate, enhanced long cycling stability under a large current density with a low capacity decay rate of approximate to 0.067% per cycle at the 0.5 C rate after 500 cycles and approximate to 0.072% per cycle at the 1 C rate after 700 cycles and an excellent coulombic efficiency of about 95% up to 500 cycles at 0.5 C and 91% up to 700 cycles at 1 C. The superior performance of S@CNTs/Co-NC should be ascribed to the rapid charge transfer, excellent electron conductivity, improved adsorption capability for LiPSs and enhanced redox kinetics of this 3D conductive network structure.

However, significant capacity decay over cycling is a major impediment for their practical applications. Polysulfides Li2Sx (3 < x <= 8) formed in the cycling are soluble in liquid electrolyte, which is the main reason for capacity loss and cycling instability. Functional polymers can tune the structure and property of sulfur electrodes, hold polysulfides, and improve cycle life. Herein, we examine a polyvinylpyrrolidone-modified carbon paper (CP-PVP) current collector in Li/polysulfide cells. PVP is soluble in the electrolyte solvent, but shows strong affinity with lithium polysulfides. The retention of polysulfides in the CP-PVP current collector is improved by similar to 50%, which is measured by a linear sweep voltammetry method. Without LiNO3 additive in the electrolyte, the CP-PVP current collector with 50 mu g of PVP can significantly improve cycling stability with a capacity retention of >90% over 50 cycles at C/10 rate. With LiNO3 additive in the electrolyte, the cell shows a reversible capacity of >1000 mAh g(-1) and a capacity retention of >80% over 100 cycles at C/5 rate.

It was presented that the modified PMIA electrospun membrane with the synthesized flame retardant possessed excellent flame retardation, outstanding thermal stability, and good mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the prepared membrane showed extraordinarily high uptake and preserving retention of the liquid electrolyte and enhanced ionic conductivity. More importantly, the assembled Li-S cells using the obtained membrane exhibited excellent cycling retention and outstanding rate capability because of its fast ion transportation and good interfacial compatibility. The assembled batteries with the novel membrane exhibited a high first-cycle discharge capacity of 1121.50 mA h g(-1), superior discharge capacity retention of 713.41 mA h g(-1), and high Coulombic efficiency of 98.46% after 600 cycles at the 0.5 C rate. In addition, the limiting oxygen index of the obtained nanofiber membrane with flame retardancy was as high as similar to 30.0%, which could greatly enhance the safety of the electrospun nanofiber separator. The excellent electrochemical performances and safety for the battery assembled with the prepared gel PMIA nanofiber membrane were attributed to the significantly prevented "shuttle effect" of lithium polysulfides based on the physical capturing of lithium polysulfides through the obtained jelly-like gel state and chemical binding of polysulfide intermediates through the tridoped phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulfur elements in the PMIA and the flame retardant. All of these excellent properties will promote the great development of the Li-S battery with high performance and satisfactory safety.

In each case, performance is compared with cells that are based on a standard mixed-ether organic electrolyte. The capacity of cells assembled with electrolytes containing 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium tris (pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate (C(4)mpyr-FAP), 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium trifluoromethanesulfonate (C(4)mpyr-OTf), or 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium tricyanomethanide (C(4)mpyr-TCM) decline rapidly due to low conductivity, high polysulfide solubility and side reaction of electrolyte with electrodes, respectively. Our results confirm that polysulfide solubility is strongly controlled by the anion of the ionic liquid and verify that not all ionic liquids decrease polysulfide solubility. In agreement with previous reports, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (C(4)mpyr-TFSI) shows the best compatibility in Li-S batteries and has a higher coulombic efficiency of greater than 99% over 100 cycles. Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy confirms that electrolyte composition influences the SEI layer formed on the lithium anode and its subsequent impedance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we develop cathode composite architecture containing silicon nitride (Si3N4)-molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hetero-structure over the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) that can resolve the above issues to a great extent. The freestanding sulfur cathode S@Si3N4/MoS2-MWCNT delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1123 mAh g(-1) at a 0.2 degrees C rate. At 1C rate the cell exhibits capacity retention of 80.7% by the end of 500 cycles with small capacity fade of 0.03% per cycle. Even at 3C rate the cell exhibits reversible capacity of 677 mAh g(-1). The excellent stability and capacity retention of the cell is attributed to (i) the highly polar Si3N4/MoS2 hetero-structure that improves electrode wettability and would efficiently trap the polysulfides through dipole-dipole interactions, and (ii) the structural advantage of Si3N4/MoS2 -MWCNT which improves both Li+ transport and charge transfer kinetics.

However, the notorious shuttle effect of polysulfides hinders the practical application of Li-S batteries. Herein, we have rationally designed and synthesized sea urchin-like Co-Mo bimetallic nitride (Co3Mo3N) in the absence of additional nitrogen sources with only one step, which was applied as the sulfur host materials for Li-S batteries. The results indicate that Co3Mo3N can efficiently anchor and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides, thus accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics and enabling prominent electrochemical properties. As a consequence, the S@Co3Mo3N cathode exhibits a high rate performance of 705 mAh g(-1) at 3 C rate and an excellent cycling stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.08% per cycle at 1 C over 600 cycles. Even at a high sulfur loading of 5.4 cmg cm(-2), it delivers a high initial areal capacity of 4.50 mAh cm(-2), which is still retained at 3.64 mAh cm(-2) after 120 cycles. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism and structural stability of Co3Mo3N during cycling were elucidated by a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure.

Introducing void space and a highly conductive host to accommodate the volume changes and enhance the conductivity would be a smart design to achieve robust construction; effective electron and ion transportation, thus, lead to prolonged cycling life and excellent rate performance. In this regard, we report the design of carbonaceous hybrid with vertically aligned graphene assembled on multi-yolk/shell structured TiC@C nanofibers to afford synergistic properties of enough space, strong chemisorption and active electrocatalysis, high electrical conductivity as a sulfur host. Thus, the asprepared sulfur cathode delivers an excellent cyclability over 800 cycles, a high areal capacity of 6.81 mA h cm(2) at a high sulfur loading (10.5 mg). More importantly, soft package battery was also prepared with a capacity of 530 mAh g(-1) and 46.5 mAh in the first cycle at a sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2), which reveals its potential in promoting the practical application of Li-S batteries.

Herein, we have elaborately designed Fe single atom decorated porous carbon nanofibers (FeSA-PCNF) through electrospinning to construct self-standing and binder-free cathodes for Li-S batteries. The unique architecture of FeSA-PCNF with interconnected fibrous networks and hierarchical porous structures guarantees rapid charge transfer kinetics as well as abundant active interfaces for LiPS conversions. Moreover, the highly active FeN4 moieties with surrounding graphitic N dopants embedded in the porous carbon nanofibers ensure strong chemisorption and superior electrocatalytic conversion towards LiPSs. As a consequence, the Li-S batteries assembled with FeSA-PCNF demonstrate superior electrochemical performances with a high rate capability of 791 mA h g(-1) at 5C and a low capacity decay rate of 0.048% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2C. More encouragingly, a high areal capacity of 11.1 mA h cm(-2) is achieved after 50 cycles with an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 17 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 mu l mg(-1). This work presents a promising strategy for rational design of self-standing and binder-free cathodes for practically feasible and high-performance Li-S batteries.

This work uses a novel multi-functional polymer binder, PEDOT: PSS-Mg2+, to address the above issues. First, PEDOT: PSS is a highly conductive polymer, which improves the conductivity of the cathode composite. Second, cross-linking of PEDOT: PSS with Mg2+ forms a robust network that is able to endure the drastic volume change of the cathode during discharge/charge. Third, the abundant oxygen atoms present in PEDOT: PSS strongly interact with lithium polysulfides to suppress the shuttle effect. Li-S batteries with this new binder showed high initial specific capacity of up to 1097 mA h g(-1) and high capacity retention of up to 74% after 250 cycles at 0.5C with a sulfur content of 70 wt% in the cathode, which are significant improvements compared with the corresponding Li-S batteries with a conventional PVDF binder. Additionally, preparation of the cathode material with this new binder uses water as the solvent, avoiding the use of toxic organic solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP).

However, effective PS-trapping designs are usually accompanied by limited Li-ion diffusion, which becomes a key issue hindering practical application. Here, a nitrogen-functionalized 2D mesoporous silica nanoplate (FMSiNP) was used to construct a dense, lightweight (<0.2 mg cm(-2)) multi-functional interlayer using a simple casting approach, which effectively suppressed the PS shuttling, while facilitating Li+ diffusion. Being able to synergistically combine the merits of strong PS trapping with fast Li+ diffusion and excellent electrolyte wettability, Li-S batteries with FMSiNP coated-interlayers show improved PS utilization and retention. These batteries additionally show a superior cycling stability, capacity fading rate (0.038% per cycle at 1.0C over 1500 cycles), a high rate performance (discharge capacity of 574 mA h g(-1) at 4.0C), low self-discharge behaviour and a high areal capacity (2.48 mA g cm(-2) over 100 cycles), when using a pure sulfur/carbon black (CB) mixture as a cathode. This rational design for multi-functional interlayers provides a facile and effective strategy to create high energy density Li-S batteries for practical applications.

To inhibit the PS shuttle effect, here we designed a modified separator by directly coating a thin layer of ultralong one-dimensional MnO2 nanowires (NWs) interlaced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator. Such a MnO2/CNT modified layer exhibits dual functions to effectively trap and reutilize the dissolved PSs, where the MnO2 NWs allow the chemical adsorption of the PSs while the CNTs form a conductive network for electron transfer to accelerate the PS redox reaction. Meanwhile, the migration of lithium ions will not be influenced due to the porous structure formed by these NWs and nanotubes. This MnO2/CNT/PP separator can significantly inhibit PS shuttling in comparison with neat MnO2 NW or CNT modified separators. Using the optimal separator, we demonstrate a highly stable Li-S battery with an initial capacity of 843.7 mA h g(-1) at 1C, and a capacity retention of 68.03% over 500 cycles. This study shows a comprehensive design strategy for a modified separator to inhibit the PS shuttle effect for highly stable Li-S batteries.

Because the surface morphology of the material determines its structural properties to some extent. Therefore, the surface of celgard-2400 is structurally modified by controlling the polymerization of dopamine to further improve the performance of the separator. Utilizing the effective adsorption performance of dopamine and the interaction with PEI, an effective network structure is formed. The polydopamine and polyethyleneimine (PDA/PEI) coating forms a good physical barrier while a large amount of N, O elements and polysulfides adsorb each other, which effectively inhibits the shuttle of polysulfides. After coating, the rapid increase of the electrolyte wettability and liquid absorption rate of the separator will provide a guarantee for lithium ion transmission. Through electrochemical tests, the initial capacity of the battery modified by PDA/PEI coating reached 1250 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, and remained above 900 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. While the rate performance and cycle stability are improved, the electrochemical impedance is also reduced. This solution can be prepared lot size is a promising improved technology.

Besides preventing dendrite growth, as in other lithium-ion batteries, the lithium powder anode achieves an elevation in lithium-ion transfer, which can be attributed to an increase in the exchange current density caused by expansion of the surface area of the anode. This promotion of lithium-ion diffusion also leads to an increase in lithium-ion transfer near the cathode site and contributes to the reversible reaction between the lithium ion and sulfur. As a result, the reversibility in cathodic reactions is enhanced, thereby improving its specific capacity and retention. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the morphology of the cathode is maintained throughout the process, and a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with lower electrolyte decomposition can be constructed. Impedance analysis also confirms that a stable electrochemical reaction is achieved with low resistance values. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

A comprehensive understanding of the shuttle-related sulfur speciation and diffusion process is vital for addressing this issue. Herein, we employed in situ/operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to trace the migration of polysulfides across the Li/S cells by precisely monitoring the sulfur chemical speciation at the cathodic electrolyte-separator and electrolyte-anode interfaces, respectively, in a real-time condition. After we adopted a shuttle-suppressing strategy by introducing an electrocatalytic layer of twinborn bismuth sulfide/bismuth oxide nanoclusters in a carbon matrix (BSOC), we found the Li/S cell showed greatly improved sulfur utilization and longer life span. The operando S K-edge XAS results revealed that the BSOC modification was bi-functional: trapping polysulfides and catalyzing conversion of sulfur species simultaneously. We elucidated that the polysulfide trapping-and-catalyzing effect of the BSOC electrocatalytic layer resulted in an effective lithium anode protection. Our results could offer potential stratagem for designing more advanced Li/S cells.

Avoiding shuttle effect is challenging but it is essential to avoid active material loss and prevent performance decay. Here, we use an ultrathin layer of MoS2 with thickness of 10-40 nm, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude thinner than conventional interlayers, for Li-S batteries to mitigate polysulfide shuttling. The MoS2 layer formed by exfoliated nanoflakes is deposited by the scalable liquid-based self-assembly method. With less than 1% of additional weight in the cathode, the MoS2 interlayer with complete coverage inhibits polysulfide diffusion across the separator and therefore remarkably improves the battery performances. Reversible specific capacity reaches 1010 and 600 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 and 2C rates, respectively, which decay slowly over 400 cycles (0.11% per cycle). Moreover, the MoS2 films with high density of catalytic active flake edges enable high areal sulfur loading up to 10 mg cm(-2) and areal capacity up to 9.7 mA h cm(-2) at a current density of 3.2 mA cm(-2).

Novel sulfur-based composite cathodes have been constantly put forward to restraint the dissolution of polysulfides; however, less attention has been paid to modifying the separator. In this work, a multi-walled carbon nanotube@polyethylene glycol (MCNT@PEG) composite is designed and prepared to modify the commercial Celgard separator. With the bifunctional MCNT@PEG-modified separator, Li-S cells possess a high initial discharge capacity of 1283 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C and undertake a long charge/discharge process of 500 cycles at 1 C with 0.12% capacity fading per cycle. Moreover, when the rate is increased to 5 C, the cells can also deliver a discharge capacity of 657 mA h g(-1). These encouraging electrochemical results highlight the excellent rate capability and high cycle stability of Li-S cells, which could be attributed to the strong chemical and physical absorption properties and high electron conductivity of the MCNT@PEG layer. This facile approach to restrain the shuttle effect of polysulfides makes further progress in obtaining the enhanced performance of Li-S batteries.

The authors propose that a transition metal selenide heterojunction (CoSe-ZnSe) catalytically accelerates bidirectional sulfur conversion reactions. A combination of synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations show that a highly active heterointerface with charge redistribution and structure distortion effectively immobilizes sulfur species, facilitates Li ion diffusion, and decreases the sulfur reduction and Li2S oxidation energy barriers. The CoSe-ZnSe catalytic cathode exhibits high areal capacities, good rate capability, and superior cycling stability with capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle over 1700 cycles. Furthermore, CoSe-ZnSe heterojunctions anchored on graphene aerogels (CoSe-ZnSe@G) enhance ionic transport and catalytic activity under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions. A high areal capacity of 8.0 mAh cm(-2) is achieved at an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 3 mu L mg(-1). This study demonstrates the importance of bidirectional catalytic heterojunctions and structure engineering in boosting Li-S battery performances.

Herein, a 3D lather-like porous carbon framework containing Fe-based compounds (including Fe3C, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3), named FeCFeOC, is designed as the sulfur host and the interlayer on separator. Due to the strong chemisorption and catalytic ability of FeCFeOC composite, the soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are first adsorbed and anchored on the surface of the FeCFeOC composite and then are catalyzed to accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, the FexOy in Fe-based compounds can spontaneously react with LiPSs to form magnetic FeSx species with a larger size, further blocking the penetration of LiPSs cross the separator. As a result, the assembled Li-S cells show excellent long-term stability (748 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles at 1.0 C, and approximate to 0.036% decay per cycle for 1000 cycles at 3.0 C), a superb rate capability with 659 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C, and lower electrochemical polarization. This work introduces a feasible strategy to anchor and accelerate the conversion of LiPSs by designing the multifunctional Fe-based compounds with high chemisorption and catalytic activity, which advances the large-scale application of high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, drawbacks such as growth of lithium dendrites, significant volume changes during the cycling process, causing safety hazards and limited span-life, have impeded the commercial application of lithium metal anode. Here, we present a new composite structure, consisting of porous three-dimensional graphene (3DG) decorated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT). The created NCNT-3DG carbon scaffold is resilient towards significant volumetric change during cycling, while the NCNTs serve as lithiophilic sites for uniform lithium nucleation which enables uniform lithium deposition. This novel hybrid endows the lithium anode with a long-term stability reaching up to 1200 cycles at high current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This significantly improved the performance of the created lithium-sulfur full cells. The demonstrated performance of the NCNT-3DG structure provides new insights for the designing and fabrication of metallic lithium anodes.

Here, an engineered lamellar yolk-shell structure of In2O3@void@carbon for the Li-S battery cathode is developed for the first time to construct a powerful barrier that effectively inhibits the shuttling of polysulfides. On the basis of the unique nanochannel-containing morphology, the continuous kinetic transformation of sulfur and polysulfides is confined in a stable framework, which is demonstrated by using X-ray nanotomography. The constructed Li-S battery exhibits a high cycling capability over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C with a capacity decay rate as low as 0.038% per cycle, good rate performance, and temperature tolerance at -10, 25, and 50 degrees C. A nondestructive in situ monitoring method of the interfacial reaction resistance in different cycling stages is proposed, which provides a new analysis perspective for the development of emerging electrochemical energy-storage systems.

The galvanostatic cycling performance of the obtained electrodes was studied in 0.5 M lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li TFSI) in 1-methyl-1-butylpyrrolidinium TFSI (BMP TFSI), 0.5 M Li TFSI in 1-methyl-1-butylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (MPP FSI), and 0.5 M Li bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI) in MPP FSI ionic-liquid (IL) electrolyte solutions. It is shown that the performance of Li-S cells is achieved by matching the IL anion, the morphology and structure of the carbon matrices, and the sulfur loading. High-performance of Li-S cells, with composite Li-S cathodes prepared with micrometersized activated carbon in IL electrolyte with FSI anions, are demonstrated at 60 degrees C.

However, the utilization of LSB suffered from the gap between the theoretical expectation and practical observation. Here, we propose the mechanistic origin of the electrocatalytic role of carbon in the N-doped graphene (NDG) layer placed on the entire cathode. We understand that the carbon in NDG acts as an electrocatalyst by interactions with polysulfide, leading to efficient electrochemical charge and discharge behaviors. A sufficient sulfur loading amount (ca. 5.75 mg cm(-2)) is successfully achieved, and the developed cell in this work enables remarkable energy density (200 W h kg(total) (-1)(cell)) and high areal capacity (4 mA h cm(-2)).

To address this issue, we herein report an interconnected porous N-doped carbon network (NPCN) incorporating Fe3C nanoparticles and Fe-N-x moieties, which is used for separator modification. The NPCN can facilitate lithium ion and electron transport and localize polysulfides within the separator's cathode side due to strong chemisorption; the Fe3C/Fe-N-x species also provides chemical adsorption to trap polysulfides and Fe3C catalyzes the redox conversion of polysulfides. More importantly, the catalysis effect of Fe3C is promoted by the presence of Fe-N-x coordination sites as indicated by the enhanced redox current in cyclic voltammetry. Due to the above synergistic effects, the battery with the Fe3C/Fe-N-x@NPCN modified separator exhibits high capacity and good cycling performance: at a current density of 0.1C, it yields a high capacity of 1517 mAh g(-1) with 1.2 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading and only experiences a capacity decay rate of 0.034% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1C; it also delivers a good capacity of 683 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C with a high sulfur loading of 5.0 mg cm(-2); after 200 cycles, the battery capacity can still reach 596 mAh g(-1), corresponding to 87% capacity retention. Our work provides a new and effective strategy to achieve the catalytic conversion of polysulfide and is beneficial for the development of rechargeable Li-S batteries.

During the synthesis process, two carbon layers not only serve as reductant to convert TiO2 into TiC nanoparticles, but also create a spatial confinement to suppress the aggregation of TiO2, resulting in the formation of well-dispersed TiC nanoparticles. This unique TiC@C structure shows an outstanding long-term cycling stability at high rates owing to the strong physical and chemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides (i.e., a high capacity of 732.6 mAhg(-1) at 1600 mAg(-1)) and it retains a capacity of 443.2 mAhg(-1) after 1000 cycles, corresponding to a decay rate of only 0.0395% per cycle. Therefore, this unique TiC@C composite could be considered as an important candidate for the cathode material in Li-S batteries.

The significant challenge in exploring novel sulfur host materials is to simultaneously inhibit the shuttle effect and heighten the reaction kinetics. Herein, a novel hybrid host consisting of W2C atomic nanoclusters (NCs) grown on a N/P-codoped graphene framework (W2C@N/P-rGO) is designed and fabricated for the first use in lithium-sulfur batteries. By means of first-principle calculations and the kinetics analysis including lithium ion diffusion coefficient and charge transfer resistance, the introduction of W2C atomic NCs benefits the enhancement of electrochemical kinetics on a polar hybrid conductor. Furthermore, the intense ability of chemically sequestrating the soluble polysulfides by W2C atomic NCs ensures the high utilization of sulfur, making the high capacity retention. With a high sulfur loading of 3.1 mg cm(-2), the W2C@N/P-rGO/sulfur composite cathode indicates a significantly enhanced electrochemical performance.

Although the Li-S batteries possess high-theoretical energy density (2600 Wh kg(-1)) and capacity (1675 mAh g(-1)), the problems of poor electron and ion conduction, volumetric expansion, and sulfur immobilization greatly impede the wide applicability of Li-S batteries. Herein, a defect-rich multishelled Co3O4 microsphere structure doped with Fe was synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method and subsequent thermal treatment. The unique multishelled structure provides multiple spatial confinements for lithium polysulfides trapping and buffering the volume variation during cycling. Moreover, the rich oxygen defect designed by controlled Fe doping can provide numerous catalytic sites for polysulfide redox reactions. Attributed to the synergistic effect of structural design and oxygen-defect fabrication, the sulfur composite electrode delivers a notable cycle performance, presenting a much lower capacity fading of 0.017% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C and an excellent rate capability of 571.3 mAh g(-1) at 5 C. This work proposes a potential approach for designing a transition metal oxide-based multishelled hollow structure combined with oxygen defect, which also offers a new perspective on high-performance Li-S batteries.

As-prepared ONPC possesses highly rich micro/mesopores as well as abundant oxygen and nitrogen co-doping, which is applied to sulfur hosts as lithium/sulfur batteries' appropriate cathodes. In battery testing, the sulfur/oxygen and nitrogen co-doped porous carbon (S/ONPC) composite materials reveal a high initial capacity of 1150 mAhg(-1) as well as a reversible capacity of 613 mAhg(-1) after the 100th cycle at 0.2 C. Furthermore, when current density increases to 1 C, a discharge capacity of 331 mAhg(-1) is still attainable. Due to the hierarchical porous framework and oxygen/nitrogen co-doping, the S/ONPC composite exhibits a high utilization of sulfur and good electrochemical performance via the immobilization of the polysulfides through strong chemical binding.

Therefore, to derive activated carbon from renewable bio-mass materials is environmentally and socially significant. Here a unique and innovative solution is proposed to produce supercapacitors and batteries from banana peels. Banana peel, which is one of the most abundant and accessible bio-wastes, naturally processes hierarchically porous structure, making activated banana peel (ABP) an ideal backbone for loading electroactive nanomaterials. The ABP derived asymmetric supercapacitors exhibited superior rate capacity and cyclic ability, as well as a synergetic enhancement of energy density and power density because the interconnected porous structure stimulated the formation of urchin-like NiCo2O4 particles, prevented the aggregation of NiCo2O4 nanowires, and enhanced the electrolyte accessibility. Orderly arranged nanopores with unique Ni/graphene core/shell nanoparticles were created by annealing the Ni(NO3)(2) solution-treated ABP. The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries built by the ABP/Ni/graphene hybrid achieved exceptionally high electrochemical properties in terms of specific capacitance (1260.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2C), rate capability, and cycling robustness.

However, its commercialization has been greatly affected by the poor cycle life and low rate performance, which is attributed to the dissolution of polysulfides and their shuttle effects. In this study, titanium dioxide particles with a large amount of exposed {001} facets (TDPEF) were prepared by alcohol-thermal method. The as-prepared TDPEF achieved a relatively high specific surface area of 92 m(2) g(-1) and a pore volume of 0.27 cm g(-1). Sulfur was mixed with the TDPEF to form TDPEF/S composite by a melt diffusion process. The TDPEF/S composite exhibits much excellent discharge capacity retention of 80 % after 100 cycles compared with pure sulfur at a high current rate of 0.5 C, and it still has a discharge capacity as high as 530 mAh g(-1) even at the current rate of 4 C.

Operando Identification of Liquid Intermediates in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries via Transmission UV-vis Spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; HIGH-ENERGY DENSITY; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; REDOX REACTIONS; POLYSULFIDES; MECHANISM; DIMETHYLFORMAMIDE; ELECTROLYTES; SPECIATION; STABILITY	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are facing various challenges with regards to performance and durability, and further improvements require a better understanding of the fundamental working mechanisms, including an identification of the reaction intermediates in an operating Li-S battery. In this study, we present an operando transmission UV-vis spectro-electrochemical cell design that employs a conventional sulfur/carbon composite electrode, propose a comprehensive peak assignment for polysulfides in DOL: DME-based electrolyte, and finally identify the liquid intermediates in the discharging process of an operating Li-S cell. Here, we propose for the first time a meta-stable polysulfide species (S-3(2-)) that is present at substantial concentrations during the 2nd discharge plateau in a Li-S battery. We identify the S-3(2-) species that are the reduction product of S-4(2-), as deducted from the analysis of the obtained operando UV-vis spectra along with the transferred charge, and confirmed by rotating ring disk electrode measurements for the reduction of a solution with a nominal Li2S4 stoichiometry. Furthermore, our operando results provide insight into the potential-dependent stability of different S-species and the rate-limiting (electro)chemical steps during discharging. Finally, we propose a viable reaction pathway of how S-8 is electrochemically reduced to Li2S2/Li2S based on our operando results as well as that reported in the literature. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

Herein, a robust flame retardant fluorinated polyimide (F/PI) nanofiber separator has been designed for high-temperature Li-S batteries. The introduction of electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl (-CF3) groups into the PI nanofiber not only increases its porosity to ameliorate the electrolyte uptake, electrolyte retention, and electrolyte wettability but also boosts its polarity to offer better affinity with LiPSs. More importantly, the existence of abundant -CF(3)groups on the PI nanofiber can afford an electronegative environment to accelerate the transmembrane transfer of Li(+)and simultaneously repel the negatively charged polysulfide ions. As a result of these advanced structural characteristics, a high initial capacity of 1512 mA h g(-1)at 0.1C, an outstanding rate performance of 532 mA h g(-1)at 5C, and a superior cycling stability with a capacity retention of 95.6% after 500 cycles at 1C can be achieved. Additionally, the flame-retardant F/PI nanofiber separator also delivers excellent cycling and safety performance at high temperature, holding a promising prospect for future commercialization.

However, the volume change and poor conductivity of sulfur, and the shuttle effect, restrict its practical applications. Herein, we develop a yolk-shell Fe3O4@S@C nanochain as the Li-S battery cathode in which sulfur is encapsulated between the Fe3O4 core and the carbon shell. After cycling 500 times at 0.2C, the Fe3O4@S@C nanochains exhibit a stable capacity of 625 mA h g(-1) and a coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8%. When measuring at temperatures of -5 and 45 degrees C, the capacities remain stable, and a well-reversible rate performance under repeated testing for three rounds is also achieved. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations show large adsorption energies of Fe3O4 towards polysulfides, indicating the capability of suppressing the shuttle effect during long-term charge and discharge.

The assembled Li-S batteries using VO-CNFs/S cathodes delivered a stable capacity of 950 mAh.g(-1) with 97% retention after 200 cycles at a 0.5 C rate with a moderate electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 20 mL.g(-1) of sulfur. Additionally, we develop cathodes with a high sulfur loading of 8.32 mg.cm(-2) that exhibits a stable capacity of 900 mAh.g(-1) after a few cycles with near 100% retention over 100 cycles. These cells correspond to a stable aerial capacity of 7.5 mAh.cm(-2). We integrate our fabrication and electrochemical performance study with fundamental investigations of Li+ diffusion kinetics, in situ visual monitoring of polysulfides, and ex situ post-mortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study to elucidate polysulfide shuttling and polysulfide-host interactions. The unique integration of oxide and nitride groups in this work results in a synergistic effect of strong Lewis acid-base interactions originating from the vacant d-orbitals of the vanadium monoxide phase and improved conductivity originating from the nitrogen doping in CNFs from a polymeric precursor, thus offering active sites for strong polysulfide binding as well as faster reaction kinetics.

In this study, a facile one-step in situ chemical activation process was adopted to synthesize porous graphitic carbon sheets (GCSs) from a tissue paper. The resulting GCS exhibits high specific surface area, large pore volume, and a highly graphitized carbon structure with graphene-like morphology. Sulfur-infused GCSs with optimum sulfur loading along with GCS-coated separator deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1643 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C rate. Moreover, when the electrode is tested at a high current rate of 1C, the cell delivered excellent cyclic stability of 652 mAh g(-1) over 200 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance attributes to the unique properties of GCS, which functions as an efficient host matrix as well as an interlayer by constraining the dissolved polysulfides in addition to the enhancement in ionic and electronic conductivities.

Sulfur has been encapsulated within their intra-sphere micropores in forms of both chain-like S2-4 (in small micropores with d < 1 nm) and cyclic S8 (in micropores with 1 < d < 2 nm). With their well-defined ultrasmall diameters, these carbon nanospheres have enabled a systematic study on the size effects of microporous carbons on the electrochemical performances of the sulfur composite cathodes. With the decrease of the nanosphere diameter from 40 to 5 nm, it is demonstrated that both the rate performance and cyclic stability of the cathodes are significantly enhanced as a result of improved electrolyte transport within the shortened intra-sphere micropores as well as abundant large inter-sphere meso-/macropores. In combination with a polysulfide-trapping poly (ionic liquid) (PDADMA-T) as the binder, we have further demonstrated that S@ACNS5 electrode exhibits an ultrahigh initial capacity of 1420 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and a superior rate performance with 50% (710 mAh g-1) of capacity retention at 5C. From the cycling test, an excellent capacity retention of 84% has been achieved at 1C even after 1000 cycles with only 0.016% capacity loss per cycle, confirming its outstanding cyclic stability.

Herein, we demonstrate a Li/polysulfide battery with 3D nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid aerogel as the binder free and self-standing host for liquid polysulfide-containing catholyte. Hetero-dopants of nitrogen and CNT additives are found to significantly improve the electrochemical performances due to the abundant active catholyte/electrolyte interfaces, high rate charge-transfer paths, and spatially uniform depositing/stripping of reactants. The final hybrid aerogel achieves long cycling stability (0.11% capacity fading rate for 400 cycles) and high rate capability (767 mAh/g(sulfar). at 2 C rate) at a high areal sulfur loading weight of similar to 6 mg/cm(2).

Herein, advanced sulfur host materials and multi-functional separator are proposed to collaboratively address these conundrums. The phosphorus-doped porous carbon (PPC) with a specific surface of 2131.5 m2/g was prepared as a sulfur host material in combination with a multi-step heat treatment. The PPC with high concentration of phosphorus doping, large surface area and reasonable pore sizes can improve the chemical adsorption of soluble polysulfides. The three-dimensional TiN/polyimide (PI) composite separator (TiN/PI) was prepared via electrospinning and stepwise imidization. The high affinity of the polar imide group in PI greatly improves the wettability of electrolytes, while the highly porous interconnected fibrous structure facilitates the fast transportation of Li+. Besides, the TiN nanoparticles can effectively inhibit the LiPS shuttle and stimulate the LiPS conversion. Consequently, the Li-S battery combining a PPC/S cathode and a TiN/PI separator offers a satisfactory performance of 630 mAh/g at 1.0C after 140cycles. This work provides a low-cost, facile and controllable method to design functional components for Li-S batteries.

The ZC and ZC-S materials kept the basic polyhedral morphology of the zeolitic imidazolate framework crystals. Sulfur is homogeneously distributed over and in the ZC porous matrix with a 51.0% sulfur mass content in ZC-S composite. The ZC material exhibits good electrochemical performances in lithium-ion batteries. After 100 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1), a reversible discharge capacity of 619 mAh g(-1)is still retained, which is benefitted by the micro/mesopores and specific surface area of the synthesized ZC material. When integrated into lithium-sulfur batteries as a cathode, the ZC-S composite exhibits stable discharge capacity of 850 mAh g(-1)after 100 cycles at 0.1 C (1 C = 1670 mA g(-1)). The increased electrochemical properties of the ZC-S electrode compared to the pristine S electrode may be attributed to the advantageous effects of the ZC porous matrix, which serve as a conductive frame promoting electron and lithium ion transportation and provide abundant active sites to increase electrochemical activity and ensnare soluble polysulfides efficiently.

The efficient interconversion between sulfur/lithium polysulfides and lithium sulfide is a performance-determining factor for lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a novel strategy to synthesize a unique tube-in-tube CNT-wired sulfur-deficient MoS2 nanostructure embedding cobalt atom clusters as an efficient polysulfide regulator is successfully conducted in Li-S batteries. It is confirmed that encapsulating MWCNTs into hollow porous sulfur-deficient MoS2 nanotubes embedded with metal cobalt clusters not only can accelerate electron transport and confine the dissolution of lithium polysulfide by physical/chemical adsorption, but also can catalyze the kinetics of polysulfide redox reactions. Based on DFT calculations, in situ spectroscopic techniques, and various electrochemical studies, catalytic effects of CNT/MoS2-Co nanocomposite in Li-S battery are deeply investigated for the first time. The CNT/MoS2-Co composite cathode exhibits a very remarkable rate capability (641 mAh g(-1) at 5.0 C) and excellent cycling stability (capacity decay rate of 0.050% per cycle at 5.0 C) even at high sulfur mass loading of 3.6 mg cm(-2). More crucially, CNT/MoS2-Co tube-in-tube nanostructures present a superior specific capacity of 650 mAh g(-1) in a Li-S pouch cell at 0.2 C (4.0 mg cm(-2)).

In this work, we adopt an automatic spreading method to coat graphene oxide (GO) layers on metallic lithium foil to form a composite electrode. The GO layers are distributed homogeneously and show low roughness on the metallic lithium foil. The electrochemical performance of GO modified Li (GO/Li) electrodes have been thoroughly studied. The GO/Li electrode displays enhanced electrochemical performances in a lithium-sulfur full battery, and better cycling stability in symmetric lithium-metal coin cells than the unmodified pure Li electrode. In addition, the growth of dendritic Li is successfully suppressed in the GO/Li electrode.

Based on scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies, it was observed that the S layer completely vanished when the cell with the S/S-CNT cathode was discharged to 2.1 V after cell assembly, indicating that the thick sulfur film dissolved in the form of polysulfide intermediates during discharge. The proposed S/S-CNT cathode delivered double the areal capacity with good capacity retention of 83% after 100 cycles, compared with that of the control cathode (S-CNT). Thus, we believe that our new cathode design will be useful in developing stable, high-energy Li-S batteries.

Here, we show the antiferroelectric pemvskite dimethylammonium zinc formate (DMAZF) MOF [(CH3)(2)NH2] Zn (HCO2)(3) as an effective molecular sieve to mitigate polysulfide (PS) migration in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) when combined with conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The DMAZF was selected due to both its nanopore structure and the presence of the Zn-metal site. The nanopores facilitate PS physical separation, whereas the Zn-site acts as a Lewis-acid site to attract the PS and also as a catalytic site to encourage electrochemical redox reactions. The hybrid DMAZF/CNTs/sulfur electrode, with 5 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading, delivers an initial high specific capacity of 1260 mAh g(-1) at 0.05C and 1007 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C with the degradation of only 0.07% after 120 cycles. Even at 7 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading, the electrode performance decreases only 0.12% per cycle even after 500 cycles at 0.5C.

The prepared composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) based on a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) network with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) and Al-TPA-MOF are mechanically robust and thermally stable up to 270 degrees C, and provide appreciable ionic conductivity in the order of 0.1 mS cm(-1) at 60 degrees C. The enhanced compatibility of CPEs with the lithium metal anode is attributed to the scavenging effect of Al-TPA-MOF. Laboratory scale all-solid-state Li-S and Li-metal polymer cells are assembled, which deliver specific capacities exceeding 800 and 130 mAh g(-1), respectively, and a stable performance upon prolonged cycling even at 60 degrees C, which is superior to earlier reports on similar systems.

Herein, we propose a KB@Ir-modified separator with a catalytic layer to facilitate the redox reaction of polysulfide intermediates and to achieve improved electrochemical performance in lithium sulfur batteries. The iridium nanoparticles not only exhibit strong chemical interaction with the polysulfides, but also efficiently accelerate the kinetic process for polysulfide conversion, especially for the reduction of soluble polysulfides towards insoluble Li2S2/Li2S. A high initial capacity of 1508 mA h g(-1) along with 90.0% utilization of sulfur could be achieved under a charge/discharge rate of 0.2C. Also the cell showed a low capacity decay rate of 0.105% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1.0C. This strategy from the point of view of electrocatalysis is expected to be effective for achieving high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries with excellent electrochemical performance.

Here, we present a straightforward method for obtaining carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as a polysulfide barrier in Li-S cells, resulting in a significant increase in cell performance. CNFs were coated both on the separator and on the cathode. The CNF-coated cathode showed a specific capacity of 1010 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.2 C, with a capacity fading of 0.021% per cycle. In addition, at 1 C, it delivered 946 mA h g(-1), thus presenting a fast Li+ transport with a good capacity. This result turns CNFs-coated cathodes into a promising system for obtaining high-performance Li-S cells.	[Garcia-Soriano, Francisco J.; Para, M.

J	Shin, W; Lu, J; Ji, XL				Shin, Woochul; Lu, Jun; Ji, Xiulei			ZnS coating of cathode facilitates lean-electrolyte Li-S batteries	CARBON ENERGY			English	Article						electrolyte-philic; lean electrolyte; Li2S cathode; lithium-sulfur battery; ZnS coating		Tremendous effort has been devoted to lithium-sulfur batteries, where flooded electrolytes have been employed ubiquitously. The use of lean electrolytes albeit indispensable for practical applications often causes low capacity and fast capacity fading of the sulfur cathode; thus, the electrolyte/sulfur active mass ratios below 5 mu L/mg have been rarely reported. Herein, we demonstrate that ZnS coating transforms sulfur cathode materials electrolyte-philic, which tremendously promotes the performance in lean electrolytes. The ZnS-coated Li2S@graphene cathode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 944mAh/g at an E/S ratio of 2 mu L/mg at the active mass loading of 5.0 mg Li2S/cm(2), corresponding to an impressive specific energy of 500Wh/kg based on the mass of cathode, electrolyte, and the assumed minimal mass of lithium metal anode. Density functional theory calculations reveal strong binding between ZnS crystals and electrolyte solvent molecules, explaining the better wetting properties. We also demonstrate the reversible cycling of a hybrid cathode of ZnS-coated Li2S@graphene mixed with VS2 as an additive at an E/AM (active mass) ratio of 1.1 mu L/mg, equivalent to the specific energy of 432 Wh/kg on the basis of the mass of electrodes and electrolyte.

It is found that the hydrophilic PAM possesses suitable swelling properties and favorable interface reaction kinetics. Moreover, the strong chemical adsorption and hydrogen bond interaction of polar functional groups mainly from PAA confine the out-diffusion of polysulfides and decrease byproduct deposition on the electrode. Electrochemical test results demonstrate that sulfur cathodes equipped with the PAM-PAA binder possess higher reversible capacity, lower charge transfer resistance, and better cycle and rate performances in contrast to conventional PVDF cathodes.

Protective interlayer for trapping polysulfides and a conducting host for sulfur: dual role of candle soot carbon for the development of high performance lithium-sulfur batteries	MATERIALS ADVANCES			English	Article							MOLECULAR-ORBITAL METHODS; POROUS CARBON; BINDER-FREE; BASIS-SETS; NANOFIBER; FRAMEWORK; CATHODE; ANODE; ELECTROCATALYST; MICROSPHERES	The commercial realization of next-generation lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is mainly hindered due to the unwanted lithium polysulfide shuttling and the insulating nature of the sulfur cathode. In the present work, we aim to overcome these critical challenges by the first-time usage of candle soot carbon as a conducting host as well as an inbuilt interlayer. The Li-S battery thus fabricated delivers an impressive capacity of 1182 mA h g(-1) with 92% coulombic efficiency at 0.1C. This excellent electrochemical performance is further maintained in long cycling even at a higher C-rate (1C) and exhibits a capacity of 667 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles with coulombic efficiency similar to 95% (an extremely slow capacity decay rate of 0.03% per cycle). Moreover, for a high-sulfur loading (4.5 mg cm(-2)) electrode the Li-S battery retains 61.3% of the initial capacity after cycling for 150 cycles at 2.0C. Further, to understand the functional mechanism of the carbon interlayer for anchoring lithium polysulfides, first principles calculations are performed based on density functional theory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such report on using inexpensive candle soot carbon as a cathode host and as an interlayer that results in outstanding electrochemical performance.

To the best of our knowledge, the 3D rGO in this work exhibits the highest specific pore volume ever. The interconnected porous structure of 3D rGO can totally confine the lithium polysulfides overcoming the shuttle effect. Also, it can offer an excellent electrical conductivity and electrolyte transportation leading to high charge storage capacity. The as-fabricated LSB provides a high discharge capacity of 1607 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and a high areal capacity of 3.53 mAh cm(-2). Even at a high sulfur loading content of 6.6 mg cm(-2), high utilization (79.4%) of active materials at the 0.1C and low capacity fading rate of 0.065% per cycle at the 1.0C with 98% coulombic efficiency over 200 cycles are achieved. The 3D rGO sponge could be useful for high-energy battery applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the practical application is limited by the low electronic/ionic conductivity of sulfur, polysulfide dissolution and sluggish conversion. To solve the above-mentioned problems, a well-designed hollow carbon sphere framework with embedded Fe3O4 nanoparticles (S/Fe3O4-NC) is reported here as an efficient sulfur host for Li-S batteries. In consequence, S/Fe3O4-NC exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1264 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), a decent rate performance of 654 mA h g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) and a cycling stability of 61.1% capacity retention after 500 cycles, which are much better than those of a bowl-like hemisphere carbon structure without metal salt (S/NC). The decent performances are not only attributed to physical confinement that prevent polysulfide dissolving. Moreover, we prove that the embedded Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively function as polysulfide capture center due to the strong dipolar interactions, so that the polysulfide can largely be fixed and confined in the porous carbon layer. In addition, the high conductivity and catalytic activity of Fe3O4 can accelerate the redox conversion of polysulfide, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from the structural and chemical optimization, a favorable performance was obtained with a capacity decay of each cycle being only 0.08% for over 500 cycles at 1 A g(-1), showing great potential for practical applications.

Herein, we report a synergistic combination of 3D carbon matrix (CdS@NG-CNT) composed of low-defect carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) decorated with low loading of cadmium sulfide quantum dots as sulfur host and carbon black (CB) as separator layer to collectively solve these issues. Specifically, the developed host material possesses abundant macropores and mesopores and high electrical conductivity, which endow the carbon matrix multifaceted structural properties for polysulfides immobilization, electrons/Li+ transfer, and Li2S formation, as well as buffering the volume expansion during cycling. The CB-modified separator can help to enhance the interconversion of intercepted polysulfides. Benefiting from these aspects, the cell equipped with CdS@NG-CNT/S//CB-PP exhibits a superior rate capacity of 1493.6 mA h/g at 0.2 C (1(st)), and maintains a capacity of 479.7 mA h/g after 1050 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.051 % at 1.0 C. This work provides a useful strategy to solve issues of the current LSBs, which may practically be used in the high-energy density.

However, its practical commercialization has been impeded by inherent drawbacks of notorious capacity decay, unsatisfied insulating nature, and sluggish conversion chemistry. To address these issues, for the first time, freestanding nanofibrous networks with hierarchical nanostructures are facilely constructed by inlaying electrocatalytic bimetallic chalcogenides (FexMn1-xS nanoparticles) into conductive graphene nanosheet (GN)-doped sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fiber matrices. Covalent-bonded SPAN featuring an insoluble mechanism serves as a reliable cathode substrate with enhanced electrostability and high sulfur utilization, while high-surface-area GN dopants promote conductivity improvement and rapid electron transfer. Meanwhile, the results prove that sulfiphilic FexMn1-xS nanoparticles with abundant electrochemically active sites facilitate construction of uniform deposition interfaces and efficient electrocatalysis conversion toward lithium polysufides. This feasible catalytic-insoluble cathode strategy drives the Li-S battery, which exhibits excellent electrochemical performances with a remarkable reversible discharge capacity of 967 mA h g(-1) and a capacity retention of 623 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles. Moreover, the corresponding lithiation/delithiation mechanisms are systematically investigated through complementary morphological and spectral analyses, providing valuable insights into advanced metal-sulfur batteries.

The synthesis of lithium sulfide-carbon (Li2S-C) composite by carbothermic reduction of lithium sulfate (Li2SO4) is investigated in this study. The relationship between reaction temperature and the consumption of carbon in the carbothermic reduction of Li2SO4 is first investigated to precisely control the carbon content in the resultant Li2S-C composites. To understand the relationship between the material structure and the electrochemical properties, Li2S-C composites with the same carbon content are subsequently synthesized by controlling the mass ratio of Li2SO4/carbon and the reaction temperature. Systematic electrochemical analyses and microscopic characterizations demonstrate that the size of the Li2S particles dispersed in the carbon matrix is the key parameter determining the electrochemical performance. A reversible capacity of 600 mAh g(-1) is achieved under lean electrolyte condition with high Li2S areal loading.

The shuttle effect caused by the migration of soluble polysulfides to the lithium anode is known as one of the crucial issues that prevent the Li-S batteries from practical application. Modification of the separator is regarded as a convenient yet efficient strategy to alleviate the shuttle effect. In this report, we use a thermally stable and chemically robust metal-organic framework (MOF), UiO-66, as a physical and chemical barrier for soluble polysulfides to functionalize the commercial polypropylene separator. The Li-S cell assembled with such a separator shows a significantly improved cycling stability with an average specific capacity of ca. 720 mA h g(-1) at a current rate of 0.5 C for 500 cycles. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the cell performance enhancement results from the physical restriction of the MOF barrier layer and strong chemical interaction between UiO-66 and polysulfides. The excellent thermal stability and chemical robustness (in acid/alkali solutions, conventional organic solvents, and polysulfide electrolytes) of UiO-66 make it highly competitive among various materials developed for separator modification in Li-S batteries.

While rationally designed redox mediators can facilitate polysulfide conversion, favorable bidirectional sulfur electrocatalysis remains a formidable challenge. Herein, selective dual-defect engineering (i.e., introducing both N-doping and Se-vacancies) of a common MoSe2 electrocatalyst is used to manipulate the bidirectional Li2S redox. Systematic theoretical prediction and detailed electrokinetic analysis reveal the selective electrocatalytic effect of the two types of defects, thereby achieving a deeper mechanistic understanding of the bidirectional sulfur electrochemistry. The Li-S battery using this electrocatalyst exhibits excellent cyclability, with a low capacity decay rate of 0.04% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. More impressively, the potential for practical applications is highlighted by a high areal capacity (7.3 mAh cm(-2)) and the construction of a flexible pouch cell. Such selective electrocatalysis created by dual-defect engineering is an appealing approach toward working Li-S systems.

Characterization performed by high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and NMR confirmed the formation of C-F bonds, which is also supported by the color change from graphite gray to light yellow. F-rGO has been used as an interlayer additive supported by a glass fiber separator in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries in order to block the diffusion/migration of polysulfides from the porous positive electrode to the metallic lithium electrode and to prevent the redox shuttle effect. Electrochemical cycling of Li-S batteries has confirmed the beneficial role of F-rGO separators, with a more pronounced effect observed for high degrees of fluorination. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies have shown a direct effect on the amount of Li2S and polysulfides found on the lithium electrode and evidenced a better reversibility of reduction/oxidation mechanisms of sulfur at the positive electrode upon discharge/charge.

J	Lu, ST; Cheng, YW; Wu, XH; Liu, J				Lu, Songtao; Cheng, Yingwen; Wu, Xiaohong; Liu, Jie			Significantly Improved Long-Cycle Stability in High-Rate Li-S Batteries Enabled by Coaxial Graphene Wrapping over Sulfur-Coated Carbon Nanofibers	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Li-S battery; Graphene; carbon nanofiber; stability	ENERGY MANAGEMENT; HIGH-CAPACITY; LITHIUM; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODES; NANOTUBES; STORAGE; OXIDE	Long-term instability of Li-S batteries is one of their major disadvantages compare to other secondary batteries. The reasons for the instability include dissolution of polysulfide intermediates and mechanical instability of the electrode film caused by volume changes during charging/discharging cycles. In this paper, we report a novel graphene-sulfur-carbon nanofibers (G-S-CNFs) multilayer and-coaxial nanocomposite for the cathode of Li-S batteries with increased capacity and significantly improved long cycle stability. Electrodes made with such nanocornposites were able to deliver a reversible capacity of 694 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and 313 mA h g(-1) at 2C, which are both substantially higher than electrodes assembled without graphene wrapping. More importantly, the long cycle stability was significantly improved by graphene wrapping. The cathode made with G-S-CNFs with a initial capacity of 745 mA h g(-1) was able to maintain similar to 273 mA h g(-1) even after 1500 charge-discharge cycles at a high rate of 1C, representing an extremely low decay rate (0.043% per cycle after 1500 cycles). In contrast, the capacity of an electrode assembled without graphene wrapping decayed dramatically with a 10 times high rate (similar to 0.40% per cycle after 200 cycles). These results demonstrate that the coaxial nanocomposites are of great potential as the cathode for high-rate rechargeable Li-S batteries. Such improved rate capability and cycle stability could be attributed to the unique coaxial architecture of the nanocomposite, in which the contributions from graphene and CNFs enable electrodes with improved electrical conductivity, better ability to trap soluble the polysulfides intermediate and accommodate volume expansion/shrinkage of sulfur during repeated charge/discharge cycles.

Thus far, most of the reported research has focused on modifying conventional polyolefin separators but with poor thermal stability and low ionic conductivity. To address these issues, herein we report a Janus separator based on a thermally stable polymeric nanofabric designed with abilities to trap polysulfides and facilitate the transport of Li+ simultaneously. This Janus separator possesses a configuration of a carbon nanofiber (CNF) layer toward the sulfur cathode and the polyimide (PI) nanofabric toward the Li metal anode. It is demonstrated that the conductive CNF layer can effectively anchor and convert the polysulfides; meanwhile, the excellent wettability with liquid electrolytes and the highly porous structure of the PI nanofiber layer significantly promote the Li+-transport. In addition, the Janus separator presents notable advantages in thermal dimensional stability benefiting from the PI nanofabric. As a result, the Li-S battery armed with the Janus separator shows a high initial capacity (1393 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), stable cycling performance (822 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) and high coulombic efficiency of 99.6%.

J	Luo, L; Manthiram, A				Luo, Liu; Manthiram, Arumugam			Rational Design of High-Loading Sulfur Cathodes with a Poached-Egg-Shaped Architecture for Long-Cycle Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; POLYSULFIDE TRAP; POROUS CARBON; PERFORMANCE; MEMBRANE; GRAPHENE; SEPARATOR; SHUTTLE; NETWORK; ENHANCE	A high-loading electrode is essential for establishing high-energy-density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, but it is confronted with critical challenges. Herein, we present a freestanding poached-egg-shaped architecture through a facile template supported vacuum-filtration strategy and employ it as an efficient sulfur host for Li-S batteries. This unique architecture guarantees an effective encapsulation of the "sulfur yolk" inside the fully vacuum sealed framework, effectively limiting the active material loss and polysulfide diffusion. Also, the conductive and porous framework serves as an interlinked electron pathway and electrolyte channel, greatly facilitating fast electric/ionic transport along with active material reactivation and reutilization during cycling. A high peak discharge capacity (1200 mA h g(-1)), a low capacity-fade rate (0.09% cycle(-1)) for 500 cycles, and excellent rate capability (C/5-1C rates) are accomplished. Moreover, with such an advantageous architecture, the sulfur loading is successfully increased to 32 mg cm(-2) to achieve an areal capacity of up to 16 mA h cm (-2). This work provides guidelines for realizing optimized high-loading Li-S batteries.

However, the low practical specific capacity and poor cycling life keep them from large scale usage. Herein, a novel binder based on a mixture of polyacrylic acid (PAA) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is designed to significantly improve the specific capacity and cycling stability of Li-S batteries via the synergistic effect of the different functional groups. The conductive PEDOT: PSS successfully facilitates electron transfer and prevents polysulfide dissolution. PAA improves the solvent system for sulfur cathodes and promotes lithium-ion transfer. The sulfur cathode with PAA/PEDOT: PSS binder in a ratio of 2 : 3 exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1121 mA h g(-1) and 830 mA h g(-1) after 80 cycles at 0.5C. The electrochemical performance of the sulfur cathode with the composite binder is better than either of the single-component binders.

Herein, we develop a Co and N co-doped carbon (CoN-CNT/HPC) as a modifying separator material to suppress this shuttle effect. The production of the material is low-cost and can be easily scaled up. The as-prepared CoN-CNT/HPC has a hybrid structure consisting of carbon nanotube (CNT) and hierarchical porous carbon sheet (HPC). This structure not only provides efficient pathways for charge transport but also encourages physical adsorption of polysulfides during the lithiation process. Additionally, the Co and N co-doping promotes the chemical adsorption of polysulfides and catalyzes polysulfide conversion. When used as a separator layer in Li-S batteries, CoN-CNT/HPC delivers excellent cycling stability with a low decay rate of 0.04% per cycle over 500 cycles at 2C. Even at high area sulfur loading of 5.5 mg/cm(2), the cell using CoN-CNT/HPC separator still exhibits a high initial capacity of 646 mAh/g at 0.5 C and an outstanding cycling stability (561 mAh/g after 100 cycles). The present work provides a simple and effective design strategy of separator materials for high performance Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, many strategies focus on the preparation of dispersive materials, which need complicated steps and some additives for making electrodes of batteries. Here, we develop a novel free-standing Co9S8 polyhedron array derived from ZIF-67, which grows on a three-dimensional carbon cloth for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery. The polar Co9S8 provides strong chemical binding to immobilize polysulfides, which enables efficiently suppressing of the shuttle effect.

Herein, MoS2 and WS2 nanosheets are produced by liquid phase exfoliation method assisted by epigallocatechin gallate. The effects of epigallocatechin gallate concentration and stripping time are investigated by UV-vis. The morphology and structure characterization of exfoliated nanosheets are studied by XRD, Raman, SEM, HRTEM and AFM, the results showing that the nanosheets have few layers and the exfoliated solution is homogeneous dispersion and stable. The exfoliated nanosheets produced by 2 mg ml(-1) epigallocatechin gallate solution for 12 h have five monolayers approximately, presenting a phase transformation from 2H to 1T structure of MoS2 nanosheets. Then, Graphene aerogel composites are prepared with the exfoliated MoS2/WS2 nanosheets, which loaded sulfur and employed as the cathode of Li-S batteries. TEM results reveal that MoS2/WS2 nanosheets are embedded in reduced graphene oxide, and sulfur is evenly distributed in the composites. The composites containing MoS2/WS2 nanosheets achieve outstanding electrochemical performance, during to the polysulfide adsorption capability of MoS2/WS2 nanosheets and reducing the shuttle effect in Li-S batteries.

A reasonable and optimized composition of the cathodic host in Li-S batteries is an efficient approach to utilize polysulfides and impede their loss. The combination of the factors preferable porosity parameters, efficient electrical framework, and intrinsic catalytic sites achieves the kinetic equilibrium of adsorption-dispersion-conversion to significantly restrain the shuttling behavior of LiPSs. In this article, carbon-based metal-doping materials (CR-Por-PPIs@800) derived from cross-linked porous porphyrin-based polyimides are constructed by a few simple reaction steps, which are used as the cathode host in Li-S batteries. These well-fabricated materials exhibit excellent porosity parameters to adsorb LiPSs and limit their diffusion shuttle and afford a high-temperature-treated conductive carbon skeleton to accelerate charge/ion transfer and expedite LiPS diffusion. Besides, metal-based substances serve as catalytic sites to elevate the conversion reaction kinetics of LiPSs. By virtue of the superior kinetic equilibrium, including adsorption from the well-constructed carbon-based framework, diffusion in the conductive network, and conversion via efficient metal catalytic sites, these CR-Por-PPIs@800 sulfur cathodes exhibit excellent cycle stability (0.051-0.081% attenuation rate under a current of 1C) and superior rate behavior. Remarkably, CR-Por-Cu-PPI@800 maintains up to 520 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C.

Lithium Sulfide (Li2S)/Graphene Oxide Nanospheres with Conformal Carbon Coating as a High-Rate, Long-Life Cathode for Li/S Cells	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						lithium batteries; sulfur; energy storage; lithium sulfide; cathodes; graphene oxide	SULFUR NANOPARTICLES; GRAPHENE OXIDE; LI2S; BATTERY; SHELL; TEMPERATURE	In recent years, lithium/sulfur (Li/S) cells have attracted great attention as a candidate for the next generation of rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical specific energy of 2600 W.h kg(-1), which is much higher than that of Li ion cells (400-600, W.h kg(-1)). However, problems of the S cathode such as highly soluble intermediate species (polysulfides Li2Sn, n = 4-8) and the insulating nature of S cause poor cycle life and low utilization of S, which prevents the practical use cif Li/S cells. Here, a high-rate and long-life Li/S cell is proposed, which has a cathode material with a core shell nanostructure comprising Li2S nanospheres with an embedded graphene oxide (GO) Sheet as a core material and a conformal carbon layer as a shell. The conformal carbon coating is easily obtained by a unique CVD coating process using a lab-designed rotating furnace without any repetitive steps. The Li2S/GO@C cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 650 mA.h g(-1) of Li2S (corresponding to the 942 mA.h g(-1) of S) and very low capacity decay rate of only 0.046% per cycle with a high Coulombic efficiency of up to 99.7% for 1500 cycles when cycled at the 2 C discharge rate.

Inspired by the reinforced concrete structure in buildings, a facile route for the synthesis of a lightweight and binder-free electrode, composed of lignin fibers@carbon nanotubes as sulfur hosts and graphene as the current collector, was reported. Benefiting from the efficient polysulfide-anchoring performance of lignin fiber, 3D conductive frameworks of CNTs and the depolarization effect of graphene, the Li-S batteries using this electrode exhibited an unprecedented discharge capacity as high as 1632 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and enhanced capacity of 987 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0C. Furthermore, even up to a sulfur loading of 9.2 mg cm(-2), this electrode still maintained a highly reversible capacity of 668.8 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C after 100 cycles, corresponding to 91.5% capacity retention. This lightweight and flexible electrode appears to be a scalable solution for obtaining high energy density Li-S batteries.

So, an internally enhanced high strength conductive three-dimensional (3D) biochar framework composite of high porosity biochar and carbon nanotube (HPBC/CNTs) is synthesized in this paper. The framework has a "reinforced concrete structure ", HPBC as "concrete " and CNTs as "reinforcement " to promote the strength of the matrix and maintain structural stability, thus improving the cyclic stability of the cathode material. In the designed composite, HPBC is interconnected and can effectively strengthens the physical constraints and traps soluble polysulfides; the CNTs buried in HPBC provides a highly reliable conductive pathway to facilitate electron/ion transport. As a result, the HPBC/CNTs/S composite exhibits good electrochemical performances. It has a high specific capacity of 1227, 1039, 739 and 639 mAh g(-1) at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0C, respectively. In long-life cycles, the composite has an initial discharge capacity of 988.41 mAh g(-1 )at 1.0C, and it is still able to maintain a reversible specific capacity of 482.42 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles, with a capacity decay rate of 0.051% per cycle.

To overcome these issues, a new type of porous phthalazinone-based covalent triazine frameworks (P-CTFs) with inherent N and O atoms has been in situ grown onto conductive reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by the sulfur-mediated cyclization of dinitrile monomers to afford the S/P-CTF@rGO hybrids. The well designed structure endows the S/P-CTF@rGO composites with several features for enhanced Li-S batteries: (i) the nanoporous structure can spatially trap the sulfur species within the P-CTFs; (ii) the covalent binding of sulfur and polar groups of phthalazinone and triazine in P-CTFs exhibits strong chemical attachment and adsorption with polysulfides and further limits the diffusion of polysulfides; (iii) the conductive rGO and semiconductive P-CTFs help faster electronic transportation and accelerate the electrochemical process. Therefore, the S/P-CTF@rGO cathodes show greatly enhanced electrochemical performances with a high initial specific capacity of 1130 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and a good capacity retention of 81.4% after 500 cycles, indicating only 0.04% degradation per cycle.

First, to improve the volumetric energy density, we reduced the thickness of freestanding electrode by the applying pressure. Second, in order to improve electrolyte conductivity and wettability for pressed freestanding electrode, we reduced the viscosity of electrolyte solution by reducing the LiTFSI salt concentration. Through these controls, the Li-S cell is constructed from a pressed freestanding carbon nanotube-sulfur cathode, 0.5 M LiTFSI in DME/DOL with 0.4 M LiNO3 as a low-viscosity electrolyte (0.72 cP), and Li-metal foil as an anode. As a result, we can obtain a high discharge capacity of 1,400 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and excellent cycle retention of 95% after 80 cycles at 0.5 C in coin-type cell. In addition, scale-up (3 by 5 cm) pouch-type Li-S cell delivers a high discharge capacity of 500 mAh at 0.1 C with high gravimetric (954.4Wh kg(-1) cathode and >170 Wh kg(-1) cell) and volumetric (1,150 Wh L-1 cathode and 515 Wh L-1 cell) energy densities.

The carbon has a high specific surface area of 1,662 m(2).g(-1) (S-BET) and micropore and mesopore volumes of 0.57 and 0.40 cm(3).g(-1), respectively. The S/C composite, with a sulfur content of 57% deposited by the disproportionate reaction of a S2O32- solution in an acid medium without an additional heating step above the S melting point, delivers an initial specific capacity of 1,148 mAh.g(-1) at a current of C/16. It also has a high capacity retention of 915 mAh.g(-1) after 100 cycles and a Coulombic efficiency close to 100%. The good performance of the composite was also observed under higher current rates and long-term cycling tests. The capacities delivered by the cell after 200 cycles were 707 and 410 mAh.g(-1) at C/2 and 1C (1C = 1,675 mA.g(-1)), respectively, maintaining the high Coulombic efficiency. The overall electrochemical response of this carbon as the sulfur matrix is among the best reported so far among the other biomass-derived carbons, probably because of the micro- and mesopore system formed upon activation.

Craig; Chiang, Yet-Ming			Solvent Effects on Polysulfide Redox Kinetics and Ionic Conductivity in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							ELECTRODES	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have high theoretical energy density and low raw materials cost compared to present lithium-ion batteries and are thus promising for use in electric transportation and other applications. A major obstacle for Li-S batteries is low rate capability, especially at the low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios required for high energy density. Herein, we investigate several potentially rate-limiting factors for Li-S batteries. We study the ionic conductivity of lithium polysulfide solutions of varying concentration and in different ether-based solvents and their exchange current density on glassy carbon working electrodes. We believe this is the first such investigation of exchange current density for lithium polysulfide in solution. Exchange current densities are measured using both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and steady-state galvanostatic polarization. In the range of interest (1-8 M [S]), the ionic conductivity monotonically decreases with increasing sulfur concentration while exchange current density shows a more complicated relationship to sulfur concentration. The electrolyte solvent dramatically affects ionic conductivity and exchange current density. The measured ionic conductivities and exchange current densities are also used to interpret the overpotential and rate capability of polysulfide-nanocarbon suspensions; this analysis demonstrates that ionic conductivity is the rate-limiting property in the solution regime (i.e. between Li2S8 and Li2S4).

Anchoring materials, such as beta-Mo2C, with strong chemical interaction has been proposed to improve the electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. However, the chemical bonding and conversion reaction of LiPSs on the Mo2C surface are not well studied. Here, we report on the discovery that the superior performance of Mo2C originates from the sulfur termination. By combining X-ray spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations, we reveal that sulfur can passivate the Mo2C (101) surface, which not only offers moderate chemical interaction with LiPSs but also facilitates the conversion reactions during both the discharge and charge processes. Our results suggest that it is important to consider the sulfurization of catalysts with metal surfaces when they are used to accelerate the conversion of polysulfides.

TiO nanocrystals were applied to these microspheres as a bifunctional material to achieve a high electrical conductivity and efficient lithium polysulfide trapping. Metallic Fe nanocrystals were used as an efficient nanocatalyst to transform the amorphous carbon in the microspheres into highly conductive graphitic carbon. These microspheres have demonstrated excellent material properties for hosting sulfur. The discharge capacities of the modified carbonaceous microspheres and original amorphous carbonaceous microspheres loaded with 70 wt% sulfur for the 450th cycle at a current rate of 0.8 C were 685 and 195 mA h g(-1), respectively, and their capacity retentions measured from the 10th cycle were 79.6 and 32.8%, respectively. The TiO nanocrystals trap polysulfides formed during the discharge process, which improves the cycling performance of the modified carbonaceous electrodes. The synergetic effects of the high electrical conductivity and graphitic carbon formation result in superior discharge capacity and high rate performance for these electrodes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, traditional CNTs with impermeable walls are not conducive to the penetration of sulfur, resulting in a large number of sulfur exposures to the electrolyte. Therefore, it is difficult to effectively limit the shuttle effect of polysulfides. Here, a kind of thin-walled porous amorphous carbon nanotube (HCNT) is adopted as the host for sulfur in LSBs. To further alleviate the shuttle effect, oxygen-containing functional groups (OCFGs) are introduced to modify HCNTs to form HOCNTs. The S/HOCNT composite with the embedded structure is successfully constructed. The S/HOCNT cathode demonstrates glorious cycling and rate performance (798.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles and 511.6 mAh g(-1) at 1 C after 500 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performance of S/HOCNT can be attributed to the embedded structure of sulfur in HOCNTs, which avoids direct contact with the electrolytes and strong bonding action of OCFGs and polysulfides, effectively limiting the shuttle effect of polysulfides.

Lithium ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and lithium-oxygen batteries are all suitable to be the power systems for next generation EVs, but their power densities and cycling performance still need to be improved to match the requirements of practical EVs. Thus, rational design and controllable synthesis of electrode materials with unique microstructure and outstanding electrochemical performance are crucially desired. Porous carbon-based composites have many advantages for energy storage and conversion owing to their unique properties, including high electronic conductivity, high structural stability, high specific surface area, large pore volume for efficient electrolyte flux, and high reactive electrode materials with controllable size confined by porous carbon frameworks. Therefore, porous carbon composites exhibit excellent performance as electrode materials for lithium ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and lithium-oxygen batteries. In this review, we summarize research progress on porous carbon composites with enhanced performance for rechargeable lithium batteries. We present the detailed synthesis, physical and chemical properties, and the innovation and significance of porous carbon composites for lithium ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, and lithium-oxygen batteries. Finally, we conclude the perspectives and critical challenges that need to be addressed for the commercialization of rechargeable lithium batteries.

Compared with sulfur, S-PPy possesses a higher discharge capacity, much better cycling stability, and better rate performance. At a current density of 200mAg(-1), the discharge capacity of S-PPy is maintained at 675mAhg(-1) after 150cycles, and even at a current density of 1675mAg(-1), the retained discharge capacity is still 617mAhg(-1) after 100cycles. The retained discharge capacity of pure sulfur, however, is only 150mAhg(-1) after 150cycles at a current density of 200mAg(-1). These results indicate that S-PPy, with its facile, low-cost, and eco-friendly synthesis, could be a potential cathode material for LSBs.

With a diameter of approximately 100 nm and a pore volume of 3.72 cm(3) g(-1), the hosts can retain sulfur within the porous structures, including the external cone-like cavities, the porous carbon shells, and the inner linings. The exquisite indented structure provides excellent electron and Li-ion pathways while the symmetrically indented voids evenly alleviate the stress induced by the volume change during cycling. The oxygen functional groups further relieve the shuttle effect of polysulfide. A composite electrode with 52% sulfur loading demonstrates a remarkable initial discharge capacity of 1478 mA h g(-1) at 1/10C (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)), corresponding to 88% sulfur utilization. Even when the sulfur/carbon (S/C) ratio of the composite is increased threefold from 1 : 1 to 3 : 1 (75% sulfur loading), a very high capacity retention is still maintained, achieving an ultraslow rate of capacity fading, similar to 0.047% per cycle over 1200 cycles at 1/2C.

However, the sluggish multielectron sulfur redox reactions are the root cause of most of the issues for Li-S batteries. Herein, a high-efficiency CoSe electrocatalyst with hierarchical porous nanopolyhedron architecture (CS@HPP) derived from a metal-organic framework is presented as the sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The CS@HPP with high crystal quality and abundant reaction active sites can catalytically accelerate capture/diffusion of polysulfides and precipitation/decomposition of Li2S. Thus, the CS@HPP sulfur cathode exhibits an excellent capacity of 1634.9 mAh g(-1), high rate performance, and a long cycle life with a low capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle over 1200 cycles. CoSe nanopolyhedrons are further fabricated on a carbon cloth framework (CC@CS@HPP) to unfold the electrocatalytic activity by its high electrical conductivity and large surface area. A freestanding CC@CS@HPP sulfur cathode with sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm(-2)delivers a high areal capacity of 8.1 mAh cm(-2)under a lean electrolyte. This work will enlighten the rational design of structure-catalysis engineering of transition-metal-based nanomaterials for diverse applications.

Microporous carbon was obtained mainly at a low activation temperature of 700 A degrees C or a low alkali/carbon of 3. Hierarchical porous carbon with ultrahigh surface area (> 3000 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (> 1.4 cm(3) g(-1)) was obtained at alkali/carbon ratio higher than 3.5 and activation temperature of 800 A degrees C. Sulfur with a high content of 65 wt% was able to be fully accommodated into the pores of hierarchical porous carbon to form C/S composite cathode for lithium sulfur battery while in the case of microporous carbon, residual sulfur on carbon surface was detected. High specific discharge capacities of more than 800 mAh g(-1) were achieved from hierarchical porous carbon/S composites at 0.5 C, and the sample synthesized at alkali/carbon of 4 and activation of 800 A degrees C exhibits the best cycling performance. After 500 cycles at 0.5 C, a high discharge capacity of 509 mAh g(-1) was maintained, indicating an excellent capacity retention. Relationship between pore characteristics of porous carbon and the electrochemical performance of its sulfur composite was discussed.

Herein, we report a straightforward modification chemistry of separator through an in-situ assembly of two-dimensional nickel-iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets onto the reticular functionalized carbon nanotubes surface (NiFe-LDH@OCNT) with enriched active sites and interconnected conducting channels. As demonstrated by the spectroscopic and electrochemical characterizations, the NiFe-LDH@OCNT composite features strong adsorption ability towards LiPSs and improvement of the LiPSs redox kinetics, thus effectively suppressing the shuttle effect. In this regard, the LSB cells assembled with the NiFe-LDH@OCNT/PP composite separators achieve the excellent reversibility and good cycling stability over 600 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.085% each cycle at 2 C.

To entrap and immobilize polysulfides, the development of catalytic material is an effective strategy for improving the lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we demonstrate that borophene-like boron subunits-inserted molybdenum frameworks of molybdenum diboride (MoB2) serves as a polysulfide-anchoring center to power redox reaction processing under the high-efficient electron transfer conditions. Specifically, MoB2 not only offers active sites to anchor polysulfide via covalent B-B and metallic Mo-Mo bonds-based low lithiation structure, but also provides a high conductivity to accelerate polysulfide conversion kinetics. With these advances, the liquid Li2S6-based MoB2 electrode (area: 2 cm(2)) offers a high initial capacity of 1116 mAh/g, and holds 558 mAh/g at 2 C after 500 cycles. Furthermore, the currently proposed MoB2 catalyst may significantly propel the advancement of electrocatalysis technology from lithium-sulfur batteries to metal-air batteries and carbon dioxide/nitrogen electrochemical reduction.

However, maintaining high energy density of Li-S batteries and their commercialization relies on the high areal loading and high utilization of active material on the electrode, which are always ignored in the most fundamental research reports. For the Li-S batteries with much higher sulfur loading, except for the well-known issues about polysulfide dissolution, some new issues such as electron and ion transport in thick cathode, depletion of electrolyte and lithium dendrite growth need to be addressed. Here, a Li-S battery with a high areal capacity is proposed by a systematic strategy incorporating two approaches as follows: 1) a hierarchically porous carbon host containing graphene (G), mesoporous carbon (MPC) and super P (SP) diminishes polysulfide migration and guarantees fast electron and ion transport in thick cathode; 2) a glass-fiber (GF) membrane severs as the electrolyte reservoir to prevent the short circuit resulted from the deficiency of liquid electrolyte. With these methods, the Li-S batteries with an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 13 mg cm(-2) provide a high areal capacity of 14.3 mA h cm(-2) (1099 mA h g(-1)) at the first cycle and stable cycling performance with a reversible capacity of 628 mA h g(-1) (8.16 mA h cm(-2)) after 75 cycles at 0.1 C.

An in situ encapsulation approach for polysulfide retention in lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							SPARINGLY SOLVATING ELECTROLYTES; REDOX REACTIONS; LI-S; PERFORMANCE; CATHODES; CHEMISORPTION; NANOPARTICLES; COMPOSITES; MOLECULES; TRANSPORT	A long-life lithium-sulfur battery requires insulation of the dissolved polysulfide intermediates from the reactive anode. However, there exists a trade-off between preventing polysulfide dissolution and facilitating the sulfur redox reactions. Here, an in situ encapsulation strategy for sulfur/carbon (S/C) composite cathode is developed. We employ antimony trifluoride as a bi-functional pre-coating layer on the S/C composite surface. During the in situ encapsulation process, the liquid electrolyte can wet the S/C composite; while being catalyzed by antimony trifluoride, the liquid electrolyte can polymerize to form a dense lithium-ion-conducting solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) layer on the S/C composite surface. Additionally, antimony trifluoride proves to have strong anchoring effects on polysulfides, which works together with the SPE layer to suppress polysulfide dissolution. The in situ encapsulated cathode enhances the cyclability with a minor sacrifice in the rate capability. It is further demonstrated that the cathode can be directly paired with a non-protected lithiated silicon anode to achieve a practical capacity retention rate of 87% for 200 cycles.	[Ren, Y.

In order to conquer the shuttle effect of dissolution lithium polysulfides (LIPSs), the chemical interactions between sulfur host and LIPSs on the performance of Li-S batteries has recently been highlighted. Herein, a facile strategy is proposed, which produces a high-entropy metal oxide (HEMO-1) as an anchor to restrain LIPSs in Li-S batteries via chemical confinement as demonstrated by strong bonding interaction between HEMO-1 and Li2S6. The as-prepared HEMO-1 incorporates five metal components, Ni, Mg, Cu, Zn and Co, into a metal oxide crystalline structure. The homogeneously dispersive multiple metal active species in HEMO-1 favor the restriction of LIPSs and facilitate the redox reaction in the cathode of Li-S batteries. Especially, the synergistic contribution of Li-O and S-Ni bonds from the interaction between HEMO-1 and LIPSs effectively alleviate the shuttle of LIPSs between the cathode and anode. As the promoter catalyst for LIPSs, HEMO-1 shows a competitive reversible capacity, outstanding cycling stability, and a low capacity decay of 0.077% per cycle after 600 cycles. This study not only presents a high-entropy oxide promoter for polysulfide immobilizing in Li-S batteries, but also provides an avenue of high-entropy metal oxides to a variety of energy conversion and storage fields.

The LCM can be impregnated with 74.5 wt% sulfur and this is also used as the cathode for a Li-S battery. The electrochemical results show that cathode with UCM as the interlayer is superior with excellent cycling stability at 0.5 C and a specific capacity of 691 mAh g(-1) after the 300th cycle. Even at 5.55 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading the cathode with UCM interlayer can obtain an areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm(-2) at the 180th cycle. The method developed here is practical for the large-scale production of LCM and UCM interlayers for use in Li-S batteries.

The product possesses hierarchically porous structure, three-dimensional conductive network framework, and polar oxygen-rich groups, which are very befitting to load sulfur leading to excellent cycling stability of lithium-sulfur batteries. The composites of CsCNBs/sulfur exhibit an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 1245 mA h g(-1) and ultralow capacity decay rate as low as 0.162% per cycle after 200 cycles at 0.1 C. Even at high current rate of 4 C, the cells still display a high initial discharge capacity (621 mA h g(-1)) and ultralow capacity decay rate (only 0.039% per cycle) after 1000 cycles. These encouraging results indicate that polar oxygen-containing functional groups are important for improving the electrochemical performance of carbons.

Herein, we develop a carbon nanotube (CNT)/S-infilled all-in-one microcapsule for Li-S batteries by catalytically growing CNTs using reduced Co3O4 nanoboxes inside a microcapsule. The encapsulation of Co3O4 nanoboxes into the microcapsule is achieved by using an oil-in-water emulsion. In the all-in-one microcapsule, the CNTs improve the conductivity, the microcapsule shell reduces the loss of polysulfides during cycling, and the void inside the microcapsule efficiently accommodates the volumetric change of sulfur. A Li-S battery based on the all-in-one microcapsule exhibits a high capacity of 1010 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles and a coulombic efficiency of approximate to 99.8%. Moreover, the battery displays stable performance when cycling at temperatures of -5 degrees C and 45 degrees C, which indicates its good potential for practical applications.

Lignosulfonate, a by-product of the paper manufacturing industry, is an abundant low cost material with unique potential as a sulfur precursor for high performance cathode materials. In this work, we develop a practical green method of using lignosulfonate as both the donor (decomposition of sulfonic groups (-SO3H)) of sulfur and the sulfur acceptor in lignosulfonate derived activated carbon. Through a circulatory pyrolysis process with carbon activation and sulfur capture, a high surface area carbon/sulfur composite was obtained. This material was successfully developed into a cathode for a lithium-sulfur battery, which demonstrates outstanding cycling stability with a capacity decay rate as low as 0.1% per cycle over 200 cycles. When the sulfur loading was further increased to 68 wt%, the capacity still reaches as high as 1100 mA h g(-1), suggesting its promising potential for applications in the field of high energy storage devices.

Cell voltage at 60% depth of discharge corresponding to the lower voltage plateau is used as a metric for calculating the cell performance. The cathode kinetics in the lower voltage plateau is defined with a single electrochemical reaction; thus, the model has a single apparent kinetic model parameter, the cathode exchange current density (i(0,pe)). The model predicts that cell voltage increases considerably with increasing carbon content until a C/S ratio of 1 is attained, whereas the enhancement in the cell voltage at higher ratios is less obvious. The model can capture the effect of the C/S ratio on the cathode kinetics by expressing the electrochemically active area in the cathode in carbon volume fraction; the C/S ratio in the cathode does not affect i(0,pe) in the model. On the other hand, the electrolyte amount has a significant impact on the kinetic model parameter such that increasing electrolyte amount improves the cell voltage as a result of increasing i(0,pe). Therefore, in the model, i(0,pe) needs to be defined as a function of the electrolyte volume fraction, which is known to have a crucial effect on reaction kinetics.

Rationally designed and engineered multicomponent heterostructure SNWs can further enhance their multifunction performance while it is very challenging to achieve such SNWs at sub-nanoscale. Herein, we synthesized Bi2O3-polyoxometalate heterostructure SNWs (PMB SNWs), and fabricated super-aligned PMB SNWs films (S-PMB SNWs films), which can serve as interlayers to efficiently suppress lithium polysulfide (LPS) shuttling, intrinsically promote the redox kinetics of the LPS conversion and substantially protect the Li anode. The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery with the S-PMB SNWs film as the interlayer showcases an ultralow capacity decay rate with 0.013% per cycle over 850 cycles. This study demonstrates the potential of heterostructure SNWs to improve the performance of Li-S batteries.

J	Phung, J; Zhang, XZ; Deng, WJ; Li, G				Phung, Jason; Zhang, Xuzi; Deng, Wenjing; Li, Ge			An overview of MOF-based separators for lithium-sulfur batteries	SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Energy storage; Li-sulfur battery; Functional separators; Metal-organic frameworks (MOF) synthesis	METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE; CARBON NANOTUBES; POROUS CARBON; CATHODE MATERIAL; PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDE; INTERLAYER; NANOFIBER; COMPOSITE	Lithium-sulfur battery (LSB) is considered one of the most promising candidates among the next-generation rechargeable batteries due to its high specific energy and low cost. However, the increase of energy density and cycling performance of LSB is still hindered by the shuttle effect. One promising solution towards suppressing the shuttle effect is the functionalization of the separator within the LSBs. A functional separator can improve overall LSB performance by impeding the shuttle effect while increasing reaction kinetics, improving ionic/electrical conductivity, and inhibiting Li dendrite growth. In this review, we mainly focus on the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to functionalize separators. This paper includes recent examples of MOFbased separators for LSB, an analysis of the mechanisms which allow MOF-based separators to improve LSB performance, key considerations for the industrial scale-up of MOF synthesis, and several research recommendations based on the above. The goal of this review is to offer a perspective on MOF-based separators and help future researchers rationally design a functional separator towards commercially viable LSB.

MWNT and GNF were manufactured by a thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, and then they were added as an additive in the sulfur electrode. The added sulfur electrodes were composed of 60wt% elemental sulfur (Aldrich), 20wt% acetylene black, 5wt% MWNT or GNF, and 15wt% poly ethylene oxide (PEO) dissolved in acetonitrile. No-added sulfur electrodes were prepared by mixing 60wt% elemental sulfur, 25wt% acetylene black, and 15wt% PEO. The addition of MWNT and GNF was found to give good electrochemical effects in sulfur electrode.

Hence, they are never employed for optimizing lithium-sulfur electrochemistry. Herein, density functional theory calculations reveal that atomically dispersed tin on a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate is expected to be highly active for electrocatalysis because of the activation of underfilled p orbitals and a significant shift of the p band center towards the Fermi level upon metal-support interaction. Under theoretical guidance, we prepared a p-block tin single atom catalyst (Sn-SA-NC) with Sn-N-4 as the active site for effectively improving the lithium-sulfur battery performance. The charge transfer between the Sn atom and N ligands creates a highly polar site that exhibits strong adsorption capability towards the electrolyte-soluble long-chain polysulfides. The unique p band structure of the central Sn atom modulates the energy barriers for the rate-determining steps of sulfur redox, thus facilitating the lithium polysulfide conversion. Besides, the exposure and utilization of Sn-N-4 sites are maximized by virtue of the 13 nm thick nanosheet morphology of the carbon substrate. Remarkably, the functional separator modified by Sn-SA-NC increases the sulfur utilization by 79.7%, and endows the lithium-sulfur cells with significantly enhanced cyclability and rate performance. This work successfully expands the employment of main group metals for electrocatalysis applications.

Herein, an elastic and conductive coating layer is designed and synthesized, by combining water soluble conducting polymer modified carbon nanotubes (PASANTs) with crosslinked waterborne polyurethane (cWPU). It shows high electronic conductivity and excellent resilience. As a result, a lithium-sulfur battery with cWPU/PASANTs coated cathode is able to achieve an outstanding cycle stability with a capacity of 70.8% after 500 cycles at 0.5C and an excellent rate performance (specific capacity of 1130 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and maintain 68.2% at 2C). This work embodies a systematic design concept, which shows the application prospects of large-scale production, and is expected to be further applied to other easily pulverized high-specific-capacity materials such as silicon and tin.

AbstractThe development of lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is restricted by their poor cycle stability and rate performance due to the low conductivity of sulfur and severe shuttle effect. Herein, an N, O co-doped graphene layered block (NOGB) with many dents on the graphene sheets is designed as effective sulfur host for high-performance LSBs. The sulfur platelets are physically confined into the dents and closely contacted with the graphene scaffold, ensuring structural stability and high conductivity. The highly doped N and O atoms can prevent the shuttle effect of sulfur species by strong chemical adsorption. Moreover, the micropores on the graphene sheets enable fast Li+ transport through the blocks. As a result, the obtained NOGB/S composite with 76 wt% sulfur content shows a high capacity of 1413 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, good rate performance of 433 mAh g(-1) at 10 C, and remarkable stability with 526 mAh g(-1) at after 1000 cycles at 1 C (average decay rate: 0.038% per cycle). Our design provides a comprehensive route for simultaneously improving the conductivity, ion transport kinetics, and preventing the shuttle effect in LSBs.

To mitigate these adverse effects, we developed a 3D MnO2 nanosheets@delaminated-Ti3C2 (MNSs@d-Ti3C2) aerogel framework via an electrostatic self-assembly approach, which proves to be a good sulfur host for high-performance LSBs. In the MNSpd-Ti3C2 aerogel, the high specific surface area and mesoporous structure benefit the high sulfur loading; the synergistic effect of the d-Ti3C2 and the polar MnO, provides a robust conductive pathway and promotes the LiPSs' adsorption and thus can effectively facilitate electron transport and strengthen the capture ability to confine the LiPSs in the cathode. As a result, the cathode based on MNSs@d-Ti3C2/S composite exhibits a high active-sulfur utilization (initial discharge capacity of 1140 mA h gs(-1)), good rate capacity (reversible capacity of 615 mA h gs(-1) at 2.0 C), outstanding specific discharge capacity, and superior capacity retention (only 0.06% capacity decay per cycle over 500 cycles at 1.0 C, even at sulfur loadings up to 3.7 mg cm(-2)).

However, the lack of electrical conductivity results in poor electrochemical utilization of sulfur and performance. This problem has been overcome to some extent previously by using a bare multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) paper interlayer between the sulfur cathode and the polymeric separator, resulting in good electron transport and adsorption of dissolved polysulfides. To advance the interlayer concept further, we present here a self-assembled MWCNT interlayer fabricated by a facile, low-cost process. The LiS cells fabricated with the self-assembled MWCNT interlayer and a high loading of 3 mg cm(-2) sulfur exhibit a first discharge specific capacity of 1112 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C rate and retain 95.8% of the capacity at 0.5 C rate after 100 cycles as the self-assembled MWCNT interlayer facilitates good interfacial contact between the interlayer and the sulfur cathode and fast electron and lithium-ion transport while trapping and reutilizing the migrating polysulfides. The approach presented here has the potential to advance the commercialization feasibility of the LiS batteries.

However, there are contradictory reports regarding the electrocatalytic activities of the different metal atoms and the role of the metal atom in Li-S chemistry still remains unclear. This is due to the complex relationship between the catalytic behavior and the structure of carbon-based SACs. Here, the catalytic behavior and active-site geometry, oxidation state, and the electronic structure of different metal centers (Fe/Co/Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene, and having similar physicochemical characteristics, are studied. Combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and electrochemical analysis, it is revealed that the coordination-geometry and oxidation state of the metal atoms are modified when interacting with sulfur species. This interaction is strongly dependent on the hybridization of metal 3d and S p-orbitals. A moderate hybridization with the Fermi level crossing the metal 3d band is more favorable for Li-S redox reactions.

However, the application of Li/S cells is still hampered by short cycle life. Sulfur graphene oxide (S-GO) nanocomposites have shown promise as cathode materials for long-life Li/S cells because oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of graphene oxide were successfully used as sulfur immobilizers by forming weak bonds with sulfur and polysulfides. While S-GO showed much improved cycling performance, the capacity decay still needs to be improved for commercially viable cells. In this study, we attempt to understand the capacity fading mechanism based on an ex situ study of the structural and chemical evolution of S-GO nanocomposite cathodes with various numbers of cycles using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that both the surface morphologies and chemical structures of the cathode materials change considerably with increasing number of cycles. These changes are attributed to several unexpected chemical reactions of lithium with S GO nanocomposites occurring during the discharge charge processes with the formation of Li2CO3, Li2SO3, Li2SO4, and COSO2Li species. These reactions result in the loss of recyclable active sulfur on the surface of the electrode, and thus capacity fades while coulombic efficiency is near 100%. Moreover, the reaction products accumulate on the cathode surface, forming a compact blocking insulating layer which may make the diffusion of Li ions into/out of the cathode difficult during the discharge charge process and thus lead to lower utilization of sulfur at higher rates. We think that these two observations are significant contributors to the capacity and rate capability degradation of the Li/S-GO cells. Therefore, for the rechargeable Li/S-GO cells, we suggest that the content of oxygen-containing functional groups on GO should be optimized and more stable functional groups need to be identified for further improvement of the cycling performance. The information we gain from this study may provide general insights into the fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanisms of other rechargeable Li/S cells using similar oxygencontaining functional groups as sulfur immobilizers.

Unlike intercalation compounds, the sulfur cathode undergoes a series of complex electrochemical reactions that give rise to substantial structural and morphological changes. Here, we report ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the lithiation and delithiation reactions that are important in Li-S batteries. The lithiation is studied on two low-energy surfaces, (100) and (001), of sulfur (SO, whereas delithiation is studied on the (111) surface of lithium sulfide (Li2S). The effect of electrolyte is included by constructing interfacial systems between these surfaces and dimethoxyethane, a widely used liquid electrolyte. During both lithiation and delithiation, a layer by-layer reaction pattern is revealed. The evolution of atomistic structure and reaction voltage during lithiation and delithiation is studied, and the microscopic reaction mechanisms are analyzed. Dissolution of lithium polysulfides into the electrolyte is also observed in our simulations, which is attributed to the strong interaction between lithium polysulfides and electrolyte molecules in the form of lithium bonds. Studies of the delithiation process in Li2S confirm that the experimentally observed initial charge barrier is of kinetic origin.

However, the shuttling of Li-polysulfides in electrolytes and sluggish electrochemical kinetics of polysulfides hinder the development of Li-S batteries. To address these stumbling blocks, we introduced pyrite-structure CoS2 hollow polyhedron modification of Ketjen black@sulfur (CoS2/KB@S) composite that adsorbs and provides sufficient sites with Li-polysulfides interaction. The CoS2 hollow polyhedron has a pivotal effect on the adsorption and catalysis performance of the polysulfides, which further accelerates the redox kinetics. Consequently, the CoS2/KB@S cathode with 3.1 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading attained a high discharge capacity of 0.5 C current density and reversible capacity was 437 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles, which displayed great stability and the capacity attenuation rate of per cycle was only 0.1%. Meanwhile, it also shows excellent rate capabilities and still maintains a high capacity of 527 mA h g(-1) at 2 C current density. Even at high sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2), the CoS2/KB@S electrode still delivers a high initial area capacity of 4.36 mA h cm(-2) at 0.3 C with capacity retention capacity of 3.63 mA h cm(-2) after 100 cycles. The cyclic and rate properties of CoS2/KB@S were greatly improved over that of KB@S. The results suggest the multifunction pyrite structure CoS2 hollow polyhedron that anchors effectively and catalysis is beneficial to realize the goal of largescale application for Li-S batteries.

The synthesis of the porous carbon nanosphere (SiOCN-H) is straightforward etching spherical SiOCN prepared through pyrolysis of a Schiff-base-SiO2 precursor. The pore structure of SiOCN-H can be easily adjusted by altering the amount of tetraethyl orthosilicate added in the aldimine condensation reaction of 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane with glutaraldehyde. The optimized sample of SiOCN-H-1 possesses a larger pore volume of 1.433 cm(3) g(-1) and contains multiple heteroatoms of Si, O, and N with a total amount of about 21 wt%. The sulfur cathode based on SiOCN-H-1 exhibits decent cycling performance, retaining 77.2% of the initial capacity at 0.2C after 100 cycles. At 0.5C, the S/SiOCN-H-1 cathode still maintains remarkable cycling stability, delivering a reversible discharge capacity of 540 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles with a low decay of 0.076% per cycle. The porous spherical structure and the chemical bonding capability of doped heteroatoms in SiOCN-H-1 primarily contribute to the high performances of the S/SiOCN-H-1 cathode by alleviating the dissolution and shuttle effect of polysulfides.

Herein, we demonstrate a synergetic vacancy and heterostructure engineering strategy using a nitrogen-doped graphene/SnS2/TiO2 (denoted as NG/SnS2/TiO2) nanocomposite to enhance the electrochemical performance of LSBs. It is noted that plentiful sulfur vacancy (V-s) defects and nanosized heterojunctions are created on the NG/SnS2/TiO2 composite as proved using electron paramagnetic resonance, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which can serve as strong adsorption and activation sites for polar polysulfide intermediates, prevent their dissolution/shuttling, and accelerate their redox reaction. The novel NG/SnS2/TiO2-S cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1064 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C and a high capacity retention rate of 68% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C.

For the synthesis of these materials we mimic nature by using wood structures as templates which are already optimized for mass transport during their long-term evolutional process. The impregnation of steam-or carbon dioxide-pre-activated wood templates with a polycarbosilane precursor and the subsequent halogen treatment yields a hierarchical material that exhibits longitudinally orientated macropores from the wood structure as well as well-defined and narrowly distributed micro-and mesopores derived from the activation and CDC approach. These materials offer specific surface areas up to 1750 m(2) g(-1), micro-/meso-pore volumes up to 1.0 cm(3) g(-1) and macropore volumes of 1.2 cm(3) g(-1). This sophisticated hierarchical pore system ensures both efficient mass transfer and high specific surface area, ideal for mass transport limited applications, such as the lithium sulfur battery. Testing steam activated wood-CDCs as cathode materials for Li-S batteries reveals excellent performance, especially a highly stable discharge capacity and sulfur utilization. Stable capacities of over 580 mA h g(sulfur)(-1) at current densities exceeding 20 mA cm(-2) (2C) are possible using only very low amounts of electrolyte of 6.8 mu L mg(sulfur)(-1).

However, the shuttle effect due to the transition between ring-like S-8 molecules and high order polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 < n <= 8) hinders their practical application. Utilizing chain-like S2-4 molecules is considered to be an effective strategy to avoid this unfavorable process; however, the preparation of a carbon scaffold with ultra-micropores to constrain S2-4 molecules is challenging. In this study, a carbon scaffold derived from macadamia nut shell (MNS) with predominant ultra-micropores of sizes less than 0.6 nm is obtained by a simple KOH etching reaction followed by a calcination process. The calcined MNS (c-MNS) exhibits a high specific surface area (1687 m(2) g(-1)), large pore volume (0.57 cm(3) g(-1)), and large number of ultra-micropores (<0.6 nm) that account for 80% of the total specific surface area and 61.4% of the total pore volume. Then, a series of c-MNS/S composites are fabricated through a melt diffusion strategy. The electrochemical performances of c-MNS/S composites used as the cathodes of Li-S batteries are evaluated. The composites deliver a maximum reversible capacity of 1254 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C rate (1C = 1675 mA g(-1)), with a capacity retention of 80% after 100 cycles, and can operate steadily up to 2C rate with a reversible capacity of 540 mA h g(-1).

J	He, JR; Chen, YF; Manthiram, A				He, Jiarui; Chen, Yuanfu; Manthiram, Arumugam			Metal Sulfide-Decorated Carbon Sponge as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst and Absorbant for Polysulfide in High-Loading Li2S Batteries	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						cathode; electrocatalysts; lithium sulfide; lithium-sulfur batteries; metal sulfides	FREESTANDING CATHODE; LITHIUM POLYSULFIDES; GRAPHENE OXIDE; SULFUR; PERFORMANCE; ARCHITECTURE; ELECTRODES	Owing to its high theoretical specific capacity (1166 mA h g(-1)) and particularly its advantage to be paired with a lithium-metal-free anode, lithium sulfide (Li2S) is regarded as a much safer cathode for next-generation advanced lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. However, the low conductivity of Li2S and particularly the severe "polysulfide shuttle" of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) dramatically hinder their practical application in Li-S batteries. To address such issues, herein a bifuctional 3D metal sulfide-decorated carbon sponge (3DTSC), which is constructed by 1D carbon nanowires cross-linked with 2D graphene nanosheets with high conductivity and polar 0D metal sulfide nanodots with efficient electrocatalytic activity and strong chemical adsorption capability for LiPSs, is presented. Benefiting from the well-designed multiscale, multidimensional 3D porous nanoarchitecture with high conductivity, and efficient electrocatalytic and absorption ability, the 3DTSC significantly mitigates LiPS shuttle, improves the utilization of Li2S, and facilitates the transport of electrons and ions. As a result, even with a high Li2S loading of 8 mg cm(-2), the freestanding 3DTSC-Li2S cathode without a polymer binder and metallic current collector delivers outstanding electrochemical performance with a high areal capacity of 8.44 mA h cm(-2).

In this work, the ultrathin nickel-doped tungsten sulfide anchored on reduced graphene oxide (Ni-WS2@rGO) is developed as a new modified separator in the Li-S battery. The surface engineering of Ni-WS2@rGO could enhance the cell conductivity and afford abundant chemical anchoring sites for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) adsorption, which is convinced by the high adsorption energy and the elongate S-S bond given using density-functional theory (DFT) calculation. Concurrently, the Ni-WS2@rGO as a modified separator could effectively catalyze the conversion of LiPSs during the charging/discharging process. The Li-S cell with Ni-WS2@rGO modified separator achieves a high initial capacity of 1160.8 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.2C with a high-sulfur-content cathode up to 80 wt%, and a retained capacity of 450.7 mA h g(-1) over 500 cycles at 1C, showing an efficient preventing polysulfides shuttle to the anode while having no influence on Li+ ion transference across the decorating separator. The strategy adopted in this work would afford an effective pathway to construct an advanced functional separator for practical high-energy-density Li-S batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Nanosheet activation is used as a viable strategy to induce a micropore system and further improve the battery performance. Accordingly, chemical activation methods dominate despite the need of multiple stages, which slow down the process in addition to making them tiresome. Here, a three-dimensional (3D) N-doped graphene specimen was physically activated with CO2, a clean and single step process, and used for the preparation of a sulfur composite (A-3DNG/S). The A-3DNG/S composite exhibited outstanding electrochemical properties such as an excellent rate capability (1,000 mAhg(-1) at 2C), high reversible capacity and cycling stability (average capacity 800 mAhg(-1) at 1C after 200 cycles), values which exceed those measured in chemically activated graphene. Therefore, these results support the use of physical activation as a simple and efficient alternative to improve the performance of carbons as an S host for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the rapid capacity fading is a significant problem facing the application of Li-S batteries. Herein, we describe an in situ confinement strategy for preparing a porous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/sulfur (pPEDOT/S) composite for Li-S batteries. The as-prepared pPEDOT/S composite exhibits a monodispersed nanostructure with sizes in the range of 400-600 nm. The pPEDOT/S composite electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability and high specific capacity. At a current rate of 0.5C, the pPEDOT/S electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 883 mA h g(-1) and a capacity retention of 71% after 200 cycles. During the charge/discharge process, the porous nanostructure could facilitate rapid electrolyte diffusion and accommodate the volumetric expansion. The chemical interaction between the PEDOT and polysulfides and discharged products could efficiently avoid the dissolution of polysulfides and the irreversible deposition of discharged products. The unique nanostructure plus the excellent electrochemical performances of the composites described in the current study allow for new opportunities to design high-performance electrodes for Li-S batteries.

Here, we report a fully integrated-ASSLSB (i-ASSLSB) whose interfacial resistances are suppressed by the segmental motion of polyethylene oxide in hierarchical polymer electrolyte throughout the whole battery system. The mobility of ethylene oxide segments and strength of polyelectrolyte membranes can be controlled by the cross-linking degree of single-ion conductive polyelectrolyte. Such a i-ASSLSB without distinct interface achieves liquid-state-level lithium-ion diffusion coefficient of 2.4 x 10(-12) cm(2) s(-1) and demonstrates a remarkable capacity up to 1428 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C and 100-cycle stability at 0.1 C. This work promises a valuable technical approach of interface modulation for high-performance all-solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries.

Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile for High-Performance Lithium-Sulfur Batteries: In-Depth Computational Approach Revealing Multiple Sulfur's Reduction Pathways and Hidden Li+ Storage Mechanisms for Extra Discharge Capacity	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; cathode materials; sulfurized polyacrylonitrile; SPAN; lithium storage mechanism; ab initio molecular dynamics; density functional theory	TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; PLANE-WAVE; LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; CATHODE MATERIALS; COMPOSITE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; SIMULATION; EFFICIENCY; STABILITY; INSIGHT	Like no other sulfur host material, polyacrylonitrile-derived sulfurized carbon (SPAN) promises improved electrochemical performance for lithium-sulfur batteries, based on its compatibility with carbonate solvents and ability to prevent self-discharge and shuttle effect. However, a complete understanding of the SPAN's lithiation mechanism is still missing because its structural features vary widely with synthesis conditions, and its electrochemical performance deviates from elemental sulfur. This study continues our research on the elucidation of the SPAN's structural characteristics and lithiation mechanisms via computational approaches. Our models reproduce most experimental data regarding carbon's graphitization level and conjugated ordering, sulfurcarbon covalent bonding, sulfur loading, and elemental composition. Our simulations emulate the discharge voltage observed in experiments for the first discharge, which reveals that sulfur follows multiple reduction pathways based on its interaction with the carbon backbone. Sulfur reduction takes place above 1.0 V vs Li/Li+ mostly in the SPAN-like material, with no long-chain lithium polysulfide formation. Below 1.0 V vs Li/Li+, the backbone's electrochemical activity occurs via multiple C-Li and N-Li interactions, mostly with edge carbon atoms and pyridinic nitrogen. Moreover, we identify Li+ binding sites throughout the graphitized backbone that might lead to prohibited energy costs for Li+ deintercalation, which may explain the irreversible capacity loss between the first and second discharges. This work improves understanding of lithiation mechanisms in sulfurized carbon, which is useful for rationally designing SPAN synthesis pathways tailored to increase sulfur loading and enhanced electrochemical performance.

To boost their energy density for practical application, modified separators are needed to suppress shuttle effects resulting from the solubility of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Herein, we modified traditional polypropylene (PP) separators with functional WS2@C nanoflower composites (WS2@C-PP). They can effectively adsorb LiPSs and catalyze their conversion on the edge sites of the WS2. Also, the unique construction of a carbon layer coating on the WS2 nanoflowers combines active sites and conducting properties. The material benefits the reversibility of redox reactions and reutilization of active materials. With the WS2@C-PP separator, the cell displays improved cycling stability and rate performance. When cycling at 0.1 C, the cell discharges a capacity of up to 1475 mAh g(-1), and it contributes 943 mAh g(-1) originally at 1 C, with a decay rate of only 0.07 % after 500 cycles. Our work highlights the potential of functional separators to advance the properties of Li-S batteries.

An alternative sulfur host is necessary to realize porous, conductive, and polar functions; however, there is a tradeoff among these three critical factors in material design. Here, the authors report a layered porous carbon (LPC) with VO2/V3S4 heterostructures using one-step carbonization-sulfidation of metal-organic framework templates as a sulfur host that meets all the criteria. In situ conversion of V-O ions into V3S4 nuclei in the confined 2D space generated by dynamic formation of the LPC matrix creates {200}-facet-exposed V3S4 nanosheets decorated with tiny VO2 nanoparticles. The VO2/V3S4 @ LPC composite facilitates high sulfur loading (70 wt%), superior energy density (1022 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, 100 cycles), and long-term cyclability (665 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, 1000 cycles). The enhanced Li-S chemistry is attributed to the synergistic heterocatalytic behavior of polar VO2 and conductive V3S4 in the soft porous LPC scaffold, which accelerates polysulfide adsorption, conversion, and charge-transfer ability simultaneously.

Their structural characterization studies are carried outviaFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Since the resulting poly-(S-r-p)p copolymers are not soluble in common solvents, an alternative soluble model compound, namely poly(S-random-phenoxy)pentachlorocyclotriphosphazene is synthesizedviathe same route of the inverse vulcanization process. Hence, this soluble model compound is able to be tested by means of(31)P and(1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy allowing better understanding of the vulcanization mechanism between sulfur and vinylic groups based on phosphazenes. Later, the electrochemical performances of poly-(S-r-p)p as a Li-S battery cathode material are evaluated and the advantage of the resulting cross-linked polymer network is highlighted by comparison with the bare sulfur cathode. To gain further insight into the lithium storage mechanism, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements are also performed before and after cycling. This work offers valuable design principles for the fabrication of sulfur-based polymers with their promising applicability in future Li-S batteries.

In this work, a simple strategy of introducing single Mo-N-4 atoms into N-doped carbon nano-flower matrix (Mo-N-CNF) as sulfur host cathode materials is developed to realize high-performance LSBs. These single Mo-N-4 atoms have been demonstrated to regulate the hydrophilic nature, Li-ion diffusion, adsorption capacity, and catalytic conversion of polysulfides via experimental evidences and theoretical calculations. The resulting Mo-N-CNF with high loading content of sulfur (>72 wt.%) exhibits a high specific capacity (1248 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C) and excellent rate capability (715 mAh g(-1) at 5 C). More importantly, the outstanding cycling performance with a low attenuation rate of only 0.004% per cycle over 400 cycles at 4.27 mA cm(-2) is achieved with the area sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm(-2). This work demonstrates a viable strategy for using single atoms-based carbon materials with high exposed sites as multiple captors for LiPS and an efficient accelerator for sulfur redox kinetics toward next-generation LSBs with boosted electrochemical performance.

The resulting heterostructures facilitate electron conduction and improve electrolyte wetting. More importantly, the composite heterostructures couple the strong polysulfide adsorption of CoSe2 and high catalytic activity of MoS2 to synergistically accelerate polysulfide conversion, demonstrating higher catalytic activity than their individual components.

J	Li, CX; Yin, LW				Li, Caixia; Yin, Longwei			Sulfur Immobilized in Hierarchically Porous Structured Carbon as Cathodes for Lithium-Sulfur Battery with Improved Electrochemical Performance	PARTICLE & PARTICLE SYSTEMS CHARACTERIZATION			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; COMPOSITE CATHODES; ANODE MATERIALS; NANOTUBES; GRAPHENE; MOLECULES; HYBRID; HOST	In order to overcome the main obstacles for lithium-sulfur batteries, such as poor conductivity of sulfur, polysulfide intermediate dissolution, and large volume change generated during the cycle process, a hard-template route is developed to synthesize large-surface area carbon with abundant micropores and mesopores to immobilize sulfur species. The microstructures of the C/S hybrids are investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The large surface and porous structure can effectively alleviate large strain due to the lithiation/delithiation process. More importantly, the micropores can effectively confine small molecules of sulfur in the form of S2-4, avoiding loss of active S species and dissolution of high-order lithium polysulfides. The porous C/S hybrids show significantly enhanced electrochemical performance with good cycling stability, high specific capacity, and rate capability. The C/S-39 hybrid with an optimal content of 39 wt% S shows a reversible capacity of 780 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at the current density of 100 mA g(-1). Even at a current density of 5 A g(-1), the reversible capacity of C/S-39 can still maintain at 420 mA h g(-1) after 60 cycles. This strategy offers a new way for solving long-term reversibility obstacle and designing new cathode electrode architectures.

Herein, tellurium is employed as a eutectic accelerator to enhance the reactivity of lithium-sulfur batteries under solid-state conversion. An SEI (solid electrolyte interface) is formed in situ on a CMK-3/S-8 cathode, which enables reactants to undergo solid-state conversion in an ether electrolyte. Electrochemical studies reveal that Te doping can accelerate the diffusion of lithium ions and reduce the reaction resistance, which are beneficial for the reaction kinetics. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses indicate that Te doping produces an SEI film with high lithium ion conductivity and low impedance. The CMK-3/S-Te-1 cathode, with 1 wt% Te doping, delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1150.2 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and 726.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C over 200 cycles. This work furnishes a strategy of using Te as a eutectic accelerator to enhance reactivity for lithium-sulfur batteries under a solid-state conversion and presents a promising avenue for application in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon cathode materials were found to effectively immobilize sulfur species and minimize the sulfur loss. In this work, we use X-ray absorption near-edge structure ()CANES) spectroscopy to probe the coordination structures of C, O, and N in a carbon cathode before and after the sulfur loading in order to better understand the effects of nitrogen doping. A significant change in oxygen coordination structure is observed, whereas the carbon and nitrogen chemical environments remain unaltered. In addition, the significant change in S K-edge XANES spectra is also observed after sulfur was loaded on nitrogen-doped carbon cathode material. These observations reveal that strong interaction between the nitrogen-doped carbon and sulfur is through oxygen functional groups, and nitrogen doping probably makes oxygen functional groups more reactive toward sulfur.

However, the uncontrolled formation of Li dendrites and shuttle effect seriously hinder its practical applications. To simultaneously address both fatal issues, herein, for the first time, we present a novel Mo2C quantum dots (MQDs) anchored N-doped graphene functionalized interlayers (MQD@NG). The DFT calculations show that lithiophilic feature of Mo2C QDs, which can construct a fast electrolyte diffusion pathway for Li+ transportation and achieve uniform Li deposition. Moreover, the polar Mo2C QDs possess strong chemical adsorption of polysulfides. As a result, the lithium symmetric cells with MQD@NG interlayers achieve a dendrite-free lithium deposition over 1600 h at a high current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Li-S cells exhibit a high capacity of 1230 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and a highly stable cycling performance over 400 cycles without obvious capacity fading. This work provides a new insight to design and fabricate high-energy and safe Li-metal-based batteries.

Despite the two factors having been researched considerably, the most applicable electrochemical performances and development method of the materials have not been reached. Here the chemical properties of a commercial AC in terms of surface functional groups and degree of graphitization were successfully improved by gamma irradiation with dose and medium variations. The number of oxygencontaining groups on the AC surface and the degree of graphitization in its structure were both found to increase after gamma irradiation, depending strongly upon the irradiation dose and medium type. The best electrochemical performance of 900 mAh/g capacity given by the AC irradiated in water medium under the experimental conditions suggested a larger correlation with the number of oxygen-containing groups than that with the degree of graphitization, which was found to be maximized in air.

Modification of a commercial separator with a functional coating layer is a facile and efficient strategy beyond nanostructured composite cathodes for suppressing polysulfide shuttling. Herein, a multilayered functional CeO2-x@C-rGO/CNT separator was successfully achieved by alternately depositing conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and synthetic CeO2-x@C-rGO onto the surface of the commercial separator. The cooperation of multiple components including Ce-MOF-derived CeO2-x@C, rGO, and CNTs enables the as-built CeO2-x@C-rGO/CNT separator to perform multifunctions from the separator surface: (i) to hinder the diffusion of polysulfide species through physical blocking or chemical adsorption, (ii) to accelerate the sluggish redox reactions of sulfur species, and (iii) to enhance the conductivity for sulfur reactivation and efficient utilization. Serving as a multilayer and powerful barrier, the CeO2-x@C-rGO/CNT separator greatly constrains and reutilizes the polysulfide species. Thus, the Li-S battery assembled with the CeO2-x@C-rGO/CNT separator demonstrates an excellent combination of capacity, rate capability, and cycling performances (an initial capacity of 1107 mA h g(-1) with a low decay rate of 0.060% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C, 651 mA h g(-1) at 5 C) together with remarkably mitigated self-discharge and anode corrosion. This work provides guidelines for functional separator design as well as rare-earth material applications for Li-S batteries and other energy storage systems.

Strategies to catalyze the sulfur liquid/solid conversion within a "hermetic" nano-container have been proposed, where the LiPS migration and sluggish reaction kinetics can be simultaneously addressed. Herein, to realize rapid LiPS conversion and slow LiPS migration, the sulfur species are packed by a hermetic catalytic interface, constructed by the phosphorene/graphene heterostructure. The 2D phosphorene/graphene stacking has two unique benefits: 1) a direct electron transfer avoiding any insulating media, resulting in an exceptional catalytic effect on LiPS conversion; ii) favorable charge rearrangement that enhances chemisorption toward LiPS and limits LiPS crossover. The proposed highly flexible hermetic interface with strong van der Waals serves as a bifunctional nano-container to pack sulfur species and promote sulfur redox reactions, which gives rise to excellent battery performances: a high areal capacity of 5.57 mAh cm(-2) under a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.7 mL g(-1). This work affords a coupling strategy that embraces interfacial and structural engineering to promote kinetic reactions of sulfur conversions under electrolyte-lean conditions.

However, the issues of polysulfide ion (PS) shuttling and uncontrollable Li dendrite growth hindered their further application. Herein, a multifunctional nanoporous polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane with well-controllable morphology was successfully designed and fabricated to address the aforementioned obstacles. In this design, the PBI membrane could offer strong chemical binding interaction with PS, thus applying dynamic adsorption toward PS as well as stable sulfur electrochemistry, which is further verified by experiments and density functional theory (DFT) simulation. Moreover, PBI membranes with high porosity and high electrolyte uptake capability can provide ample lithium storage space and abundant Li+ supplements to facilitate Li deposition and improve Li metal batteries' cyclic stability. Besides that, the PBI membrane has excellent mechanical and thermal stability and exclusive flame resistance, which guarantees the safety of the Li-S battery as well. As a result, Li-S batteries assembled with an as-developed PBI membrane demonstrated a remarkable rate capability of 780 mAh g(-1) at 2C and an impressive reversible capacity of 523 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C after 400 cycles, which is much higher than the commercial separators. More importantly, even with a lofty sulfur loading of 3 mg cm(-2), a high discharge capacity of 744 mAh g(-1) (capacity retention 93.96%, at 0.1C after 100 cycles) can also be achieved. Overall, the current study highlighted a robust material platform for stable, safe, and efficient multifunctional separators for high- performance Li-S batteries.

Transition metal oxides are promising mediators to alleviate these problems, but the poor electrical conductivity limits their further development. Herein, the homogeneous CoNiO2/Co4N nanowires have been fabricated and employed as additive of graphene based sulfur cathode. Through optimizing the nitriding degree, the continuous heterostructure interface can be obtained, accompanied by effective adjustment of energy band structure. By combining the strong adsorptive and catalytic properties of CoNiO2 and electrical conductivity of Co4N, the in situ formed CoNiO2/Co4N heterostructure reveals a synergistic enhancement effect. Theoretical calculation and experimental design show that it can not only significantly inhibit "shuttle effect" through chemisorption and catalytic conversion of polysulfides, but also improve the transport rate of ions and electrons. Thus, the graphene composite sulfur cathode supported by these CoNiO2/Co4N nanowires exhibits improved sulfur species reaction kinetics. The corresponding cell provides a high rate capacity of 688 mAh g(-1) at 4 C with an ultralow decaying rate of approximate to 0.07% per cycle over 600 cycles. The design of heterostructure nanowires and graphene composite structure provides an advanced strategy for the rapid capture-diffusion-conversion process of polysulfides.

Albeit these outstanding qualities, the polysulfide shuttling effect and low electrical conductivity of the sulfur active material in this battery chemistry results in poor cycling performance. In an attempt to overcome these problems, a hybrid structure of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) and reduced graphene oxide was developed and coated on the surface of a conventional separator using air-controlled electrospray. Implementing these coated separators in Li-S batteries led to lower polarization and stymied the polysulfide shuttling effect through the combining effects of electrostatic, physical, and chemical interactions. Our results reveal that the capacity and rate capacity are drastically improved via coating the separator, leading to more than twice the capacity of over 800 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C rate, when it is compared to those with the pristine separator. Overall, this hybrid coating material shows great promise in enhancing the current Li-S battery technology.

The LYZP membrane with a reasonable Li+-ion conductivity shows both favorable chemical compatibility with the lithium polysulfide species and exhibits good electrochemical stability under the operating conditions of the Li-S batteries. Through an integration of the LYZP solid electrolyte with the liquid electrolyte, the hybrid Li-S batteries show greatly enhanced cyclability in contrast to the conventional Li-S batteries with the porous polymer (e. g., Celgard) separator. At a rate of C/5, the hybrid Li parallel to LYZP parallel to Li2S6 batteries developed in this study (with a Li-metal anode, a liquid/LYZP hybrid electrolyte, and a dissolved lithium polysulfide cathode) delivers an initial discharge capacity of approximate to 1000 mA h g(-1) (based on the active sulfur material) and retains approximate to 90% of the initial capacity after 150 cycles with a low capacity fade-rate of <0.07% per cycle.

However, the shuttle effect and sluggish redox reaction kinetics of sulfur species result in unsatisfactory cycle life and sulfur utilization, hampering the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this work, meso-/microporous core-shelled MoC nanocrystal-embedded N-doped carbon microspheres (MoC/NC CSMSs) were prepared and further used as sulfur hosts. The tailored mesoporous core and microporous-thin shell cooperate to guarantee a high sulfur loading, good electrolyte penetration, improved structural stability, and relieved shuttle effect. Besides, the uniformly distributed MoC nanocrystals enhance the affinity to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) via the formation of the Mo-S bond and accelerate the conversion kinetics of LiPSs by catalyzing the formation and decomposition of Li2S clusters. After sulfur loading, the MoC/NC/S CSMS electrode exhibits remarkable lithium storage properties with a high reversible capacity of 1370.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, outstanding rate performance, and ultra-long cycle life with a low capacity decay rate of 0.034% per cycle for 500 cycles at 1C.

Different strategies have been implemented to reduce the shuttle effects, with limited success, especially through use of low sulfur loadings (1-2 mg/cm(2)). Dense electrodes with high sulfur loadings are essential for high energy cells, however, such electrodes experience more serious polysulfide effects. In this paper, we describe the benefits of blending sulfur with a transition metal sulfide (here, TiS2 and MoS2) to form dense composite cathodes with enhanced conductivity. There is an improvement in both the initial capacity from sulfur utilization (similar to 800 mAh/g based on sulfur content), the coulombic efficiency (>96%) and also in cycle life upon blending with the metal sulfide. High sulfur loadings (>12 mg/cm(2) or similar to 6 mAh/cm(2) per side) were demonstrated to display high sulfur utilization in Li-S cells containing the metal sulfide blends either with or without coatings over the sulfur cathode. XRD studies were carried out to understand the redox behavior of the metal sulfide additive during charge/discharge cycling of the sulfur cathodes. DC polarization and Potentiometric Intermittent Titration Technique (PITT) measurements were made on sulfur cathodes with and without metal sulfide blends to determine the charge transfer and diffusional kinetics.

However, polysulfide shuttling and slow kinetics hinder the practical application. We fabricated hierarchically heterostructured CoSe2/MoS2 nanoarrays on carbon clothes as the sulfur cathode host. The resulting heterostructures facilitate electron conduction and improve electrolyte wetting. More importantly, the composite heterostructures couple the strong polysulfide adsorption of CoSe2 and high catalytic activity of MoS2 to synergistically accelerate polysulfide conversion, demonstrating higher catalytic activity than their individual components.

However, their practical application is hampered due to rapid capacity degradation and low areal capacity induced by the shuttling of intermediate polysulfides and slow reaction kinetics. The host material plays a critical role in enhancing cycling stability and rate capability. Here, we reported a simple and scalable strategy to construct a rich nitrogen-doped carbon-based host with a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous network and interconnected microchannels. Specifically, both channels and porous structure could be regulated by adjusting the ratio of polyacrylic acid to polyacrylonitrile in the precursor. The nitrogen-doped porous carbon network effectively suppressed the translocation of the polysulfide and triggered fast redox kinetics resulting from the fast charge transfer at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. Taking advantage of the hierarchical porous architecture design, the nitrogen-doped porous carbon framework/sulfur composite electrode delivered high initial discharge capacity of 1228 mA h g(-1) with 81.9% capacity retention and low capacity decay of 0.06% after 300 cycles. Even at a high sulfur loading of 6.5 mg cm(-2), the electrode still achieved capacity retention of 65.1% and a lower capacity fading rate of 0.069% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1C. In particular, this hierarchical porous network structure opens a new avenue to develop an electrode with high energy density and long life for electric storage applications.

J	Choi, C; Park, JB; Kim, DW				Choi, Changhoon; Park, Jung Been; Kim, Dong-Wan			A synergistic engineering layer with a versatile H2Ti3O7 electrocatalyst for a suppressed shuttle effect and enhanced catalytic conversion in lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ELECTRICAL ENERGY-STORAGE; NITROGEN-DOPED CARBON; LONG CYCLE LIFE; PERFORMANCE; SEPARATOR; METAL; GRAPHENE; POLYSULFIDES; NANOTUBES; CATHODE	Lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S batteries) are considered a promising technology for advanced energy storage devices, owing to their exceptionally high theoretical energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, the detrimental polysulfide shuttle effect and the sluggish redox kinetics of Li-S batteries are the major obstacles to the development of high-performance Li-S batteries. In this study, a synergistic engineering layer comprising a versatile H2Ti3O7 electrocatalyst and conductive supporting materials (HTO-sCNT-G) was developed for advanced Li-S batteries. In the ingenious three-dimensional internal hierarchical percolating microstructure of HTO-sCNT-G, the polar H2Ti3O7 nanowires acted as an effective mediator of polysulfide (PS) conversion and suppressed the shuttle effect due to their strong chemical interaction with PSs, while the carbon components (CNTs and graphene) provided a three-dimensional conductive network that increased the electronic conductivity of H2Ti3O7. Furthermore, the hierarchical porous structure without graphene overstacking increased the accessible surface area for rapid Li+ diffusion, thereby improving the ionic conductivity, and HTO-sCNT-G acted as an auxiliary sulfur host, providing an additional conductive network to reutilize the trapped PSs. Owing to the synergistic effect of HTO-sCNT-G, the resultant Li-S batteries exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance with a significantly high reversibility (1001 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C and 794 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1C with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.057% per cycle) and improved rate capabilities at different current rates (792.1, 631.7, and 509.5 mA h g(-1) at 1, 2, and 3C). Thus, this study provides new insight for the development of synergistic engineering interlayers/modified separators for advanced Li-S batteries without elaborate electrocatalyst-conductive agent hybrid synthesis.

This stable structure was obtained by the chemical-assisted reduction of oxygen-containing groups and polyvinyl pyrrolidone, removal of silica templates, and freeze drying. Owing to the hierarchical pores and doped nitrogen in HrGO, the HrGO-supported sulfur (HrGO/S) cathode exhibited superior electrochemical performance with high rate capacity and long cycling life. HrGO/S with the sulfur content of 84.43 wt% delivered the high specific capacity of 863 mA h g(-1) at the high current rate of 2C with coulombic efficiency greater than 99.5% and maintained the reversible capacity of 463 mA h g(-1) after 600 cycles, corresponding to the capacity decay of 0.077% per cycle. Even when the sulfur content was as high as 91.4 wt%, HrGO/S still exhibited the specific capacity of 810 mA h g(-1) at 2C. The hierarchically porous structure and doped nitrogen synergistically rendered HrGO a promising host material for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we prepared nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets (N-HPCNSs) through direct pyrolysis of their mixtures and subsequent NH3 treatment. The as-prepared N-HPCNS shows hierarchical porosity (specific surface area of 1735 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 1.71 cm(3) g(-1)), and a moderate nitrogen doping of 1.7%. Moreover, it can be effectively applied in various energy storage/conversion systems. When used as super-capacitor electrodes, it shows a high specific capacitance of 128 F g(-1) in organic electrolytes and retains 45% of the original capacitance even at an ultrahigh current density of 100 A g(-1). It can also serve as an effective sulfur carrier in lithium-sulfur batteries. The N-HPCNS/sulfur cathode shows high discharge capacities of 1209 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C and 493 mA h g(-1) even at 4C. Over 500 charge/discharge cycles at 1C, it still retains a high discharge capacity of 486 mA h g(-1) with an ultralow capacity loss of 0.051% per cycle and a high average coulombic efficiency of 99.4%.

Quasisolid-state electrolyte (QPE) is considered to be a promising alternative to traditional liquid electrolyte, which can improve the safety and cycling performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, a novel poly(vinyl carbonate-co-butyl acrylate) QPE with 3D crosslinked network (PEGDA-P(VCA-co-BA)) is designed to capture lithium polysulfide through a chemical adsorption of abundant ester groups. The PEGDA-P(VCA-co-BA) QPE exhibits high ionic conductivity of 2.9 mS cm(-1). In order to synergize the beneficial effect of the PEGDA-P(VCA-co-BA) QPE, the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube film-supported sulfur/Li cells are assembled with the QPE. As-assembled lithium-sulfur batteries show high initial capacity of 1080 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, long cycle life (capacity retention of 715 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles) and superior rate performance.

This nanostructure was derived from crude soybeans in a facile pyrolysis process. Using it as a sulfur host, the S/C active composite with 80% sulfur content was made. Cells with different sulfur loadings were investigated and were found to demonstrate large capacity, high coulombic and energy efficiencies, and high cycling stability. In particular, for a sulfur loading of 5.5 mg cm(-2) and a sulfur content of 80%, cells displayed a specific capacity of ca. 950 mA h g(-1), which corresponds to an areal capacity of 5.2 mA h cm(-2). Such a performance moves LSB technology closer to practical applications.

However, since high gravimetric energy density can only be achieved at a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio, the severe performance degradation under lean electrolyte conditions is becoming a bottleneck in the development of Li-S batteries. Here we propose a new class of gel polymer electrolytes by using titanium-oxo clusters as reinforcements to construct low E/S batteries. The developed electrolyte has favorable mechanical properties and high Li-ion conductivity, as well as excellent capabilities to block polysulfide shuttling and suppress Li dendrite formation, enabling low E/S batteries to exhibit enhanced capacities and cycling stabilities. Remarkably, the low E/S (3 mu L mg(S)(-1)) battery fabricated with high sulfur loading (10 mg(S) cm(-2)) and low negative/positive capacity ratio (1/1) can deliver a gravimetric energy density of 423 W h kg(-1) and continue to operate for 100 cycles. This study provides a new avenue for high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

The high electronic conductivity and abundant oxygen-containing functional groups of F-NHCS can not only be served as the conductive matrix for loading S as the cathode (F-NHCS-S) but also exhibit strong absorption capability to anchor S atoms and thus effectively solve the dissolution issue of intermediates polysulfides during cycling. As a result, the as-obtained F-NHCS-S cathode exhibits excellent performances: delivering an initial specific capacity of 827mAhg(-1) at 0.2C with about 74wt% S loading and retaining a specific capacity of 549mAhg(-1) after 100cycles, compared to the respective 747mAhg(-1) and 182mAhg(-1) of the cathode based on the host without N-doping and functionalization (HCS-S). The fabrications of the hosts and the corresponding cathodes are demonstrated by the physical characterizations from SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD, FT-IR, BET, and TGA.

Electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries based on a sulfur cathode obtained by H2S gas treatment of a lithium salt	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium sulfur battery; Lithium sulfide electrode; Lithium salts; Lithium sulfide composite	LI2S PARTICLES; ION BATTERIES; ELECTROLYTE; ANODES; ENERGY; CARBON	A new technique to produce Li2S/C composites and Li2S cathodes as well as their application in high capacity Li-S batteries is demonstrated. The simple but effective method converts an easy-to-handle lithium salt-containing composite or electrode to Li2S using H2S. The main advantage is that the conversion to Li2S can be performed towards the final stage of the electrode preparation process, which significantly reduces the need of controlled atmosphere otherwise required for Li2S handling. LiOH is used to demonstrate the technique, and such fabricated Li2S electrode is successfully used in a Li-S battery (half-cell) where it shows discharge capacities of up to 770 mAh g((Li2S))(-1) and retained >410 mAh g((Li2S))(-1) after 100 cycles at C/5.

However, this technology faces great challenges from both anode and cathode, which are mainly caused by the nature of materials. Here, we report a kind of multifunctional carbon derived from biomass like rice husk for optimizing both lithium (Li) metal anode and sulfur (S) cathode for Li-S batteries. It has been proved that the surface functionalized rice husk derived carbon could effectively achieve the controllable deposition of Li. Notably, the nucleation overpotential is reduced and the Coulombic efficiency is also improved. As for the cathode, the biomass carbon with high specific surface area and natural SiO2 nanoparticles is benificial for confining sulfur and sulfides. As a result, when the modified Li metal anode paired with carbon/sulfur composite, the battery delivers improved discharge capacity, rate capability and cycling stability. Moreover, the overpotential between charge and discharge process in Li-S batteries is obviously lowered compared with bare Li foil. This novel and straightforward design via employing sustainable biomass for constructing both anode and cathode materials may do great help to achieve the commercialization of Li-S batteries.

But large-scale application of this technology is hindered by the poor ionic conductivity of solid-state electrolytes and high interfacial resistance at ambient temperature. In addition, seeking an appropriate carbon matrix for solid-state Li-S batteries is challenging. Herein, with the purpose of addressing these problems, N-doped carbon nanosheets (N-CNs) as a matrix for optimizing a sulfur cathode was successfully prepared. Furthermore, we fabricated innovative poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based solid-state polymer electrolytes (SSPEs) containing ionic liquid grafted oxide nanoparticles (IL@NPs), which showed high ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Additionally, the differences among IL@NPs based on ZrO2, TiO2, and SiO2 are compared. The electrolyte with IL@ZrO2 showed the highest ionic conductivity of 4.95 x 10(-4), 2.32 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 50 and 37 degrees C, respectively. With advanced and innovative designs in both cathode and electrolyte, our solid-state Li-S battery exhibits improved electrochemical performance. The battery with SSPEs based on IL@ZrO2 delivered a high specific capacity of 986, 600 mA h g(-1) at 50 and 37 degrees C, respectively. It's believed that this strategy, using IL@NPs added SSPEs and the N-CNs/S cathode, may shed light on prospective applications with all-solid-state Li-S batteries.

The undesired capacity degradation upon cycling originates from gradual diffusion of lithium polysulfides out of the cathode region. To prevent losses of certain intermediate soluble species and extend lifespan of cells, the effective encapsulation of sulfur plays a critical role. Here we report an applicable way, by using thin-layered nickel-based hydroxide as a feasible and effective encapsulation material. In addition to being a durable physical barrier, such hydroxide thin films can irreversibly react with lithium to generate protective layers that combine good ionic permeability and abundant functional polar/hydrophilic groups, leading to drastic improvements in cell behaviours (almost 100% coulombic efficiency and negligible capacity decay within total 500 cycles). Our present encapsulation strategy and understanding of hydroxide working mechanisms may advance progress on the development of lithium/sulfur cells for practical use.

This cell configuration allows us to avoid the use of Li metal electrode and the concomitant dendritic deposition of Li metal at the negative electrode during charging, thereby rendering the cell operation highly safe and stable. The solvate ionic liquid electrolyte solution was composed of tetraglyme, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide, and a hydrofluoroether. The solubility of lithium polysulfide (reaction intermediate of the positive electrode) is very low, resulting in high Coulombic efficiency of discharge/charge and long cycle life of the Si/Li2S cell.

Multidimensional operando analysis of macroscopic structure evolution in lithium sulfur cells by X-ray radiography	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							PROPYLENE CARBONATE SOLUTIONS; IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; IN-SITU; MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS; BATTERIES; DIFFRACTION; ELECTRODES; CATHODE; DEGRADATION; CHEMISTRY	Lithium sulfur cells are the most promising candidate for the post lithium-ion battery era. Their major drawback is rapid capacity fading attributed to the complex electrochemical processes during charge and discharge which are not known precisely. Here we present for the first time a multidimensional operando measurement by combining X-ray radiography with impedance spectroscopy while galvanostatically charging and discharging a lithium sulfur cell. The formation of macroscopic sulfur crystals at the end of charge can be seen directly by X-ray radiography. These crystals can be assigned to stable alpha-sulfur (rhombic) and metastable beta-sulfur (monoclinic) by their characteristic crystal habit. These crystal structures with a length of more than 1 mm form and dissolve rapidly during cycling. Their appearance is accompanied by characteristic signals in impedance spectroscopy. Macroscopic crystals of Li2S cannot be observed in full agreement with earlier studies by operando X-ray diffraction. In addition, X-ray radiography reveals non-wetted areas on the carbon cathode. These regions grow during discharge and are reduced during charge. The area of these electrochemically inactive spots is inversely proportional to discharge capacity.	[Risse, S.; Jafta, C.

However, most substrates applied to electrodes, which have both high conductivity and full coverage of adsorption-catalysis synergies, are difficult to achieve. Herein, the combination of electrospinning and hydrothermal method is developed to fabricate the composite membrane of ferri-based spinel CoFe2O4 (CFO) loaded nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (CFONC) applied to positive current collector with Li2S6 catholyte and binderfree of Li-S batteries. Benefiting from the improved catalytic performances in redox reaction of lithium polysulfides due to the abundant active sites which originate from CFO, the CFONC composite with S loading of 4.74 mg exhibits an initial specific discharge capacity of 1096 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and a high specific discharge capacity of 681 mAh g-1 after 500 cycles with a capacity decay as small as 0.076% per cycle. Even with S loading of 7.11 mg, the cell of CFONC delivers a high initial capacity of 6.1 mAh and maintains 4.8 mAh after 300 cycles. The results show that the efficient chemical anchoring polysulfides and catalyzing redox reaction by multifunctional CFONC composites is a feasible strategy for the large-scale application of lithium sulfur batteries with high performance in the future.

In this paper, CSs with particle sizes were prepared with glucose by hydrothermal method and activated by KOH. Three ACSs with particle sizes were used to load with sulfur as cathodes of Li-S batteries to analyze the effects of different specific surface areas on battery performance.

The data show an electrode reflecting the crystalline structure of S-8 and Sn, with a suitable morphology that consists of micrometric sulfur particles surrounding a metallic core of nanometric tin. This particular configuration leads to optimal behavior in the lithium cell, with a highly reversible electrochemical process evolving between 1.9 and 2.8 V versus Li+/Li and low polarization. The S-Sn composite shows a favorable electrode/electrolyte interphase having a resistance limited to few ohms after the first activation charge/discharge cycle in the Li/S cell, which allows suitable operation with excellent rate capability and limited capacity fading. Indeed, the cell shows an efficiency approaching 100% upon the first cycle, a maximum specific capacity of about 1200 mAh g(-1) at C/10 rate, and still a relevant capacity value of about 700 mAh g(-1) at the relatively high C-rate of 2 C, with suitable retention upon 100 charge/discharge cycles.

Herein, an N-doped hierarchical porous carbon composite is synthesized via a high temperature carbonization method. The N-doped hierarchical porous carbon with a large number of micropores, mesopores and macropores provides the abundant interconnected network matrixes and high specific surface area, thus guaranteeing a high sulfur loading, and adapting the volumetric expansion during the lithium intercalation process. The macropore channels and conductive interconnected networks can accelerate the diffusion of electrons/ions among the cathode. Moreover, the mesopores and micropores besides the high amount N-doping accommodate high-level sulfur loading and immobilize lithium polysulfides via physical absorption and chemical confinement. The as-prepared N-doped hierarchical porous carbon compounded with sulfur as a cathode delivers a satisfactory initial capacity of 1285 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) and a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) over 1000 cycles, illustrating the improved electrochemical performances of the cathode. The high temperature carbonization method provides a new way to construct the hierarchical porous structured carbon with chemical doping. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the detailed mechanism has yet been fully understood. In this work, a series of battery configurations have been designed to further analyze the function mechanism of the carbon interlayer. The controlled studies demonstrate that the function of the interlayer as an accessorial current collector to provide and transport electrons plays the most important role in enhancing the dischargeability and reversibility of the sulfur cathode. The fundamental understanding of the function mechanism will provide further insight for the rational design of the interlayer structure in the Li-S battery system.

Li2S-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites as cathode material for lithium sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium; Sulfide; Battery; Polysulfide; Cathode	HIGH-CAPACITY; IRREVERSIBLE OXIDATION; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODE; PARTICLES; COMPOSITES; SHUTTLE; CELL	A lithium sulfide-reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (Li2S-rGO) was synthesized and evaluated as the cathode material and Li source for the assembly of Li-S batteries. The composite, with a unique 3-D pocket structure, was synthesized by a combination of facile solution chemistry and thermal treatment. The as-prepared Li2S-rGO nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Xray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, which showed 20-40 nm Li2S particles homogeneously dispersed between reduced graphene oxide sheets. Li2S contents as high as similar to 66% could be obtained. When used with an electrolyte containing LiNO3 and polysulfide, the Li2S-rGO nanocomposites exhibited a high initial capacity of 982 mAh g(-1) Li2S. However, there was noticeable capacity fade in subsequent cycles, probably due to polysulfide dissolution and the shuttle mechanism, but a capacity of 315 mAh g(-1) could still be obtained after 100 cycles, with 90-95% coulomb efficiency. The effect of polysulfide additive in the electrolyte on the activation of Li2S in the first delithiation step was discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we report a liquid-based, low-cost and reliable synthesis method of a lithium-sulfur composite cathode with improved cyclability. An open network of Conductive Carbon Black nanoparticles (Cnet) is infused with a sulfur network (Snet) to form sponge-like networks (Cnet + Snet). Initially, Snet is open to the outside, allowing liquid electrolyte to infiltrate and impart Snet Li+ conductivity. During lithiation, Cnet could accommodate the volume expansion of Snet largely without losing electrical contact. During delithiation, the carbon nanoparticles would preferably flocculate on the outer surface due to polysulfide dissolution and depletion of sulfur, to form a passivation layer that still allows Li+ exchange, but prevents more polysulfides from escaping, thus slowing the leaching of polysulfides into the bulk electrolyte liquid. The plausibility of a carbonaceous passivation layer was checked using an extra carbon deposition layer to achieve an improved performance of similar to 400 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles under a high rate 2.0 C. A 763 mA h g(-1) discharge specific capacity of this sulfur nanosponge cathode (abbreviated as "SULFUN") was obtained after 100 cycles under a rate of 0.2 C. Discharge capacities of 520 mA h g(-1) and 290 mA h g(-1) were attained after 300 and 500 cycles, respectively, making this cathode material attractive for rechargeable battery applications.

Field-emission scanning electron microscope analysis shows a homogeneous distribution of sulfur in the graphene nanosheet matrix. The sulfur/graphene nanocomposite exhibits a super-high lithium-storage capacity of 1580 mAh?g-1 and a satisfactory cycling performance in lithiumsulfur cells. The enhancement of the reversible capacity and cycle life could be attributed to the flexible graphene nanosheet matrix, which acts as a conducting medium and a physical buffer to cushion the volume change of sulfur during the lithiation and delithiation process. Graphene-based nanocomposites can significantly improve the electrochemical performance of lithiumsulfur batteries.

However, the rate capability of Li-S batteries is still unsatisfactory because of the insulating nature of S and Li2S2/Li2S. Here, we report highly graphitized mesoporous carbon/Mn7C3 ( GMC/Mn7C3) nanospheres for high-rate lithium-sulfur batteries. Manganese oxides are first introduced into the mesoporous carbon precursor, which promotes the formation of highly graphitized porous carbon during the following carbonization process. The content of Mn7C3 is optimized, so highly conductive graphitic carbon host and mesoporous morphology are simultaneously achieved and beneficial for high-rate transfers of both electrons and Li ions. The resulting S/GMC/Mn7C3 cathode can be charged/ discharged up to 10-C rate, yielding a 50% capacity retention ratio comparing to that at 0.5 C. This work suggests a possible approach for future development of high-rate Li-S batteries. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

However, both electrode volume variation and serious shuttling effects during the charge/discharge process limit the promotion of lithium-sulfur batteries. In this work, a novel self-healing poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer with dynamic disulfide bonds (2S-PDMS) was designed as a binder for sulfur electrodes. The disulfide bonds in 2S-PDMS molecules can reversibly break and form, facilitating the conversion of polysulfides, as evidenced from both experimental and calculated results. In addition, 2S-PDMS binders with a remarkable self-healing ability and flexibility can keep the sulfur cathode integrated without cracks or damage. Consequently, the 2S-PDMS-based cathode exhibits both high capacity and excellent cycling stability, showing a specific capacity of 545.7 mA h g(-1) at 2.0C after 400 cycles (79.6% capacity retention). Moreover, soft-packed Li-S batteries with a high sulfur loading of 6.6 mg cm(-2) deliver a high areal capacity of 4.54 mA h cm(-2) after 50 cycles, which verifies the good flexibility and stability of the 2S-PDMS-based cathode.

To tackle these problems simultaneously, a layer-by-layer electrode structure is designed, each layer of which consists of ultrafine CoS2-nanoparticle-embedded porous carbon evenly grown on both sides of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The CoS2 nanoparticles derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have an average size of approximate to 10 nm and can facilitate the conversion between Li2S6 and Li2S2/Li2S in the liquid electrolyte by a catalytic effect, leading to improved polysulfide redox kinetics. In addition, the interconnected conductive frameworks with hierarchical pore structure afford fast ion and electron transport and provide sufficient space to confine polysulfides. As a result, the layer-by-layer electrodes exhibit good rate capabilities with 1180.7 and 700 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 and 5.0 C, respectively, and maintain an impressive cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.033% per cycle within ultralong 1000 cycles at 5.0 C. Even with a high sulfur loading of 3.0 mg cm(-2), the electrodes still show high rate performance and stable cycling stability over 300 cycles.

However, its large-scale commercial application is hindered by severe shuttle-effect and insulation of the sulfur. Herein, in order to overcome these disadvantages, mulberry-like three-dimensional hollow reduced graphene oxide microspheres modified with cobalt oxide nanoparticles (CoO/MGra) were designed as sulfur host. CoO/MGra possesses not only excellent electrical conductivity but also provides sufficiently large space for the storage of sulfur. The three-dimensional hollow structures can also significantly alleviate the volume expansion of sulfur during the cycling process. At the same time, the shuttle effect is suppressed due to the efficient chemical adsorption towards lithium polysulfide by CoO nanoparticles. As a result, excellent cycle stability (1010 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles at 0.2C) and outstanding rate performance (745 mAh g(-1) at 3C) are achieved when using the S-CoO/MGra cathode.

Herein, layered bamboo-like conductive carbon nitride (c-CN) material is designed and fabricated throughout a metal-organic-framework-derived strategy, targeting emerging energy storage applications in both separator-modified lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries and flexible solid-state supercapacitors. When used as a functional separator of Li-S systems, an initial capacity of 1532.1 mA h g(-1) could be achieved at 0.2C, with favorable rate capabilities of similar to 1145.7 and 996.8 mA h g(-1) achieved at 1.0 and 2.0C, respectively. Moreover, the as-prepared c-CN yields a large capacitance value of 333.8 F g(-1) with a cycling stability of over 88% capacitance retention after 12 000 cycles when used as the capacitive electrode. The further-derived flexible, symmetric, quasi-solid-state supercapacitor devices exhibit stable performance under deformations, exhibiting extended usability in wearable scenarios. This strategy paves an emerging route toward metal-free materials beyond graphene for use in flexible energy storage devices.

However, their poor capacity retention limits their practical use. Herein, sulfur-loaded activated carbon was used as the cathode of LSB. The functionalized carbon fiber paper (CFP) containing carboxyl and amide groups was used as an interlayer of LSB. With these designs of the LSB, it can provide excellent charge storage performance with high capacity retention. The LSB using ethylenediamine (EDA)-functionalized CFP interlayer exhibits an outstanding initial discharge capacity of 1800 mAh g(-1) and 1472 mAh g(-1) after the stable SEI formation with ca. 92% capacity retention and low degradation rate of 0.046% per cycle after 200 cycles at 1C. A strong adsorption capacity of polysulfide and amide functional group of EDA-functionalized CFP reduces the shuttle mechanism phenomenon. The density functional theory calculation shows that EDA-functionalized CFP can strongly bind high order polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 <= n <= 8) when compared to other functional groups. Furthermore, the fully charged LSB cell with ca. 3.5 mg cm(-2) sulfur loading content on the cathode can practically supply electricity to a nominal 3-V spinning motor for 25 min demonstrating the practical use of our as-fabricated LSB.

Herein, we report a more effective approach outperforming this conventional one: a heterogeneous catalysis to promote polysulfide fragmentations. It was revealed using combined computational and experimental approaches that an ultrastrong adsorption of elemental sulfur on TiN surfaces resulted in a spontaenous fragmentation into shorter chains of polysulfides. This heterogeneous catalysis reaction improved the sluggish kinetics of polysulfide reduction because of the chemical disproportionation at the second plateau.

However, the serious polysulfide "shuttle effect", volume expansion effect and slow conversion reaction kinetics of Li -S batteries during the charge/discharge cycle process still need to be resolved urgently. Herein, we prepared a novel sulfur host of SnO 2 -decorated MoS 2 hollow microspheres (SnO 2 -MoS 2 HMSs). The unique hollow structure provides enough space to accommodate a large amount of sulfur and effectively adapts to its large volume expansion during charge and discharge process. On the other hand, the SnO 2 nanoparticles that attached to the surface of the MoS 2 nanosheets will accelerate the catalysis of MoS 2 and enhance the bonding strength with the polysulfide intermediates through the S -Sn -O chemical bond, which further inhibits the shuttle effect. The newly synthesized SnO 2 -MoS 2 HMSs cathode has achieved excellent electrochemical performance. The initial discharge specific capacity of 1326.4 mAh g -1 was obtained at 0.2 C, and after 100 cycles, the specific capacity of the SnO 2 -MoS 2 HMSs/S cathode only decreased slightly to 1183.8 mAh g -1 , its capacity retention rate reaching as high as 89.2%. We expect the newly synthesized hollow structured MoS 2 with SnO 2 decoration provides a new strategy for the construction of Li-S battery cathode materials.

Compared to its inorganic or carbon counterparts, the HCP has a relatively high specific surface area of 1980 m(2) g(-1) with a total pore volume of 2.61 cm(3) g-1, resulting in sulfur content in HCP/S of as high as 80 wt %. As a benefit of the unique HCP structure, the HCP/S composite exhibits a high initial discharge specific capacity (1333 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C), high-rate property, and good cycling stability (658 mA h g(-1) after 120 cycles at 0.5 C and 604 mA h g(-1) after 80 cycles at 1 C). Furthermore, the capacity of cells loses less than 1% after the first 20 charge/discharge cycles, while the HCP/S cathode can be cycled with an excellent Coulombic efficiency of above 94% after 120 cycles. Compared with pristine sulfur, the superior electrochemical performance of HCP/S composite is related to the cross-linked porous framework. Such structure could provide short ionic/electronic conduction pathways and suppress the polysulfide shuttle during the discharge process.

The sluggish reaction kinetics of LiPSs results in rapid capacity decay. In this work, we constructed a free-standing multifunctional interlayer decorated with V2O3/VN catalysts to suppress the shuttle effect and boost the redox reaction kinetics. The introduction of VN with strong chemical adsorption improves the conductivity of V2O3, which is beneficial for the kinetics of conversion reaction. In addition, the micro/mesopores inside the structure not only facilitate ion diffusion but also buffer the volume change of the sulfur cathode during the cycling process. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the fabricated cells exhibit a high specific capacity of 1419.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C. The cell with V2O3/VN/C exhibits a promising cycling performance over 1000 cycles with a decay rate of 0.037% per cycle at 1C. The synergistic effects of electrocatalysts and conductive carbon material provide inspiration on the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, Co3O4 nanoflakes with uniform macro pores distribution were synthesized via facile oil bath and calcination methods. Coupled with super P and coated on common polypropylene separators, they were expected to hinder the migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and accelerate the redox kinetics of polysulfides. Coin cells assembled with the Co3O4-super P interlayer exhibited a capacity of 760 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, maintained 598 mA h g(-1) after 350 cycles, and the decay rate of discharge capacity was only about 0.062% per cycle. Such high performance can be attributed to the synergistic effects between polar Co3O4 and conductive super P. The facile fabrication method and high performance make the Co3O4-super P interlayer a feasible material to apply in lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, a nanocomposite consisting of well-dispersed and lamellar-like shape CoS anchored on g-C(3)N4 nanosheets (CoS@g-C3N4) is prepared firstly, and then it is integrated on a polypropylene membrane combined with little conductive Ketjen black (KB) to fabricate a multi-functional and quite thin interlayer, with a thickness of only similar to 2.1 um and areal mass loading of similar to 0.0 7 mgcm(2). The as-prepared interlayer firstly can capture polysulfides by Li-N bond as well as Lewis acid-base interaction between CoS and polysulfide anions (S-n(2-)), and more importantly, it also displays a positive effect on catalyzing the redox conversion of intermediate polysulfides. As expected, a Li-S cell assembled with this modified separator and high sulfur content cathode displays an excellent electro-chemical performance, with specific capacity of similar to 1290 mAh g(1) at 0.2C and a low fading rate of 0.03% per cycle after 500 cycles at 1.0C. Furthermore, a high sulfur mass loading of similar to 4.0 mgcm(2) elec-trode paired with this multifunctional separator exhibits a stable specific capacity of similar to 600 mAh g(1) after 250 cycles under 0.1C. This work can give some guides to rational design a quite thin and light interlayer for improving the utilization of sulfur species, with little damage to the energy density and Li ion trans-portation in Li-S batteries.

This novel system is effective in avoiding sever corrosion of Li-metal anode and significantly improving the safety of present Li-S cell, owing to the replacement of Li-metal anode with graphite. The introduced superconcentrated ether electrolyte has a unique networking structure of Li cations and TFSI anions with Li+-solvating DME/DOL solvents, which is conducive to form a stable TFSI-derived surface film on the graphite electrode. The stable and dense TFSI-derived film inhibits further electrolyte decomposition and graphite exfoliation caused by co-intercalation of solvents, allowing reversible lithium intercalation and de-intercalation at a graphite electrode. Besides, the severe polysulfides shuttle is also suppressed by the concentrated ether-based solutions. Consequently, the assembled graphite-sulfur full battery retains outstanding capacity of 686 mAh g(sulfur)(-1) at 0.1C rate after 105 cycles, along with high Coulombic efficiency.

However, the hasty capacity fading originating from the solution and migration of polysulfides is the major obstacle for their industrial application. The polysulfide adsorption and repulsion effect achieved by adding an extra coating layer on the side of the cathode and separator have been separately proved to be effective in mitigating the shuttle effect. Herein, a cooperative coated separator, which employs a hybrid carbon matrix as the coated material, including an appropriate ratio of N-doped activated conductive carbon and commercial acetylene black, and sulfonated polystyrene as the binder, is established to prevent the migration of polysulfides and serves as a secondary current collector to reutilize the active materials for high-performance lithium sulfur batteries. The research results showed that the coated separator with 50 wt% N-doped activated conductive carbon as the coating material and sulfonated polystyrene as the binder showed highlighted cycle performance, and 731 mA h g(-1) was maintained after 150 cycles at 800 mA g(-1)(the capacity retention was 86.0%). The superior performance may be because the coated separator can efficiently restrain the polysulfides by physical and chemical effects and also reject the polysulfides by the anion electrostatic effect. In summary, this study provides a new cooperative way to address the shuttle effect and promotes the development of lithium sulfur batteries.

Herein, we report flexible high-energy-density lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries based on all-fibrous sulfur cathodes and separators. To implement free-standing and flexible sulfur cathodes, electrically conductive single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are impregnated with cellulose nanofibers. This fibrous structure forms a 3D porous electrode with a large surface area to improve redox kinetics and achieve a high sulfur loading content without the use of a metal collector, which can then be applied in high-energy-density batteries. These flexible sulfur cathodes are combined with a commercial glass fiber separator coated with a CNT layer through a cost-effective solution process to suppress the shuttle effects of lithium-polysulfide, thereby exhibiting robust cycling stability. The prepared Li-S batteries exhibit high capacities of 940mAh g-1 at a charge current density of 1.57 mA cm-2 and at 25 degrees C, and the Coulombic efficiency exceeds 90% even after 50 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, Li-S batteries with a high gravimetric energy density of 443 Wh kg-1 per cell is achieved, and these batteries demonstrate excellent reliability in regard to electrochemical performance even under severe mechanical stress conditions for over 100 cycles.

The macroporous structure of litchi shells is believed to be conducive to distribute the activation agent, which enables sufficient activation. The as-prepared activated carbon was developed as a conducting framework for lithium-sulfur battery cathode materials. The resulting activated carbon/sulfur composite cathode possesses a high specific capacity, good rate capability, and long-term cycling performance. At 200 mA g(-1) current density, the initial discharge capacity of the activated carbon/sulfur composite cathode with 60 wt% sulfur content is 1105 mA h g(-1). At a current density of 800 mA g(-1), the activated carbon/sulfur composite cathode shows 51% capacity retention over 800 cycles with a fade rate of 0.06% per cycle. The coulombic efficiency of the cell remains at approximately 95%. By adding LiNO3 in the electrolyte, the activated carbon/sulfur composite electrode tested at 800 mA g(-1) shows a high coulombic efficiency (>99%). The activated carbon/sulfur composites exhibited similar capacity value and cycling trends with an increase in sulfur content from 60% to 68%. The good electrochemical performance can be attributed to the excellent structural parameters of the activated carbon. The ultrahigh specific surface area and large pore volume not only enhances the sulfur content but also ensures dispersion of elemental sulfur in the conducting framework, thereby improving sulfur utilization. The small nanopores of the activated carbon can effectively inhibit the diffusion of polysulfides during the charge/discharge process.

To overcome this obstacle, various two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based metal-free compounds have been proposed to serve as anchoring materials for immobilizing soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPs), which however suffer from low electronic conductivity implying unsatisfactory performance for catalyzing sulfur redox. Therefore, we have predicted metallic C5N monolayers, possessing hexagonal (H) and orthorhombic (O) phases, exhibiting excellent performance for suppressing the shuttle effect. First-principles simulations demonstrate that O-C5N could serve as a bifunctional anchoring material due to its strong adsorption capability to LiPs and excellent catalytic performance for sulfur redox with active sites from both basal plane and zigzag edges. Furthermore, the rate of Li2S oxidation over O-C5N is fast due to the low energy barrier of 0.93 eV for Li2S decomposition. While for H-C5N, only N atoms located at the armchair edges can efficiently trap LiPs and boost the formation and dissociation of Li2S during discharge and charge processes, respectively. The current work opens an avenue of designing 2D metallic carbon-based anchoring materials for lithium-sulfur batteries, which deserves further experimental research efforts.

Hollow TiN microspheres with a porous shell were prepared to host sulfur (TiN-S) for use as a Li-S battery cathode. The TiN-S electrode delivered a high capacity of 1206.1 mA h/g at 0.1 C, and a narrow value domain of 1218.2 +/- 17.7 mA h/g was obtained from initial discharge capacities of 9 cells. Furthermore, a capacity of 623.3 mA h/g (with a retention of 67.5%) was maintained after 300 progressive cycles at 1 C. The superior cycling performance of the TiN-based cathode can be ascribed to the following: (1) TiN improved the electrical conductivity of the cathode, effectively increasing the active sulfur utilization; (2) the hollow TiN microspheres with pores restricted the soluble polysulfides by both chemical and physical interactions; (3) the large void of the spherical cavity in TiN could accommodate the change in volume of the cathode during the discharge-charge processes.

However, the ion-electron insulating nature along with the large volume changes of sulfur and Li2S significantly hinder the full exploitation of their high theoretical specific capacities, especially in ASSLSBs. In this work, dense composite sulfur carbon (S/C) cathodes featuring sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) supported by a macroporous carbon (MaPC) conductive matrix (SPAN@MaPC) are prepared to solve the above issues. ASSLSBs consisting of the SPAN@MaPC-Li6PS5Cl-vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF) composite cathode are evaluated. With similar to 1 mg cm(-2) pure sulfur loading in the cathode, the assembled ASSLSBs achieved a high reversible capacity of 1396.2 mA h g(-1) under an applied current of 0.1C at room temperature and still retained 715.5 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. The reason it has achieved such performance is that the sulfur in SPAN, which is uniformly dispersed at the atomic level and covalently bonded to the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) carbon skeleton, has higher electrochemical reactivity. Further, the electrochemical behavior of SPAN@MaPC in the first cycle is revealed. Also, it is evidenced that the irreversible C-Li bonding contributes partially to the super-theoretical capacity.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are shown to be effective cathode materials for Li-S batteries, but the nature of sulfur-host interactions in these porous materials is not well-understood. Herein, we provide a detailed analysis on material and chemical properties that have direct influence on sulfur adsorption and battery performance. Favorable binding sites in CuBTC, a MOF proven promising for sulfur adsorption, are identified and characterized by a combination of theoretical, thermogravimetric, spectroscopic, and electrochemical experiments. By manipulating MOF particle size, we further demonstrate that a high density of Cu-rich surface defects drastically improves both maximum discharge capacity and polysulfide retention. Battery cycling data illustrates the significance of these surface Cu sites for the uptake of dissolved polysulfides, which mitigates irreversible capacity loss. In the wider scope of materials development, our findings suggest the use of carefully engineered surface defects in inorganic nanomaterials may enhance sulfur capture in Li-S batteries. This study thus advances chemical understanding towards rational design of porous materials with great implications for energy storage, sulfur removal, chemical sensing, and environmental remediation.

The samples were tested by various characterization tools, so that to study the influences of precursors on the physical and electrochemical properties of g-C3N4. The results showed that the as-prepared U-CN (from urea), M-CN (from melamine), T-CN (from thiourea), and D-CN (from dicyandiamide) exhibited significantly different microstructures. The synthesized g-C3N4 powders were used as sulfur matrixes for lithium-sulfur batteries. The electrochemical properties revealed that urea-derived C3N4 showed the highest initial capacity of 1207 mAh g(-1).

Herein, an Fe-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework Fe-ZIF-8 is used as a precursor to synthesize a Fe-N-C polyhedron composite that shows a high specific surface area of 1459.3 m(2)g(-1), a large pore volume of 1.037 cm(3)g(-1)and a high nitrogen content of 7.29 at%. Benefiting from the high surface area and polarity of the carbon matrix, the Fe-N-C polyhedron composite can effectively adsorb and confine LiPSs. The S@Fe-N-C based electrode with a high sulfur loading of 72 wt% shows a high initial specific capacity of 1296 mA h g(-1)at 0.1C and can retain a capacity of 450 mA h g(-1)after 500 charge-discharge cycles at 1C, corresponding to a low fading rate of 0.068% per cycle. In contrast, a low capacity of 345 mA h g(-1)is observed for the S@N-C reference electrode even after only 200 cycles. Moreover, the Fe-N-x-C(y)sites within the S@Fe-N-C electrode can also efficiently catalyze the redox conversion of LiPSs during the charge-discharge process, leading to a much higher reversible capacity of 1178 mA h g(-1)at 0.1C, as compared with the 626 mA h g(-1)for the S@N-C electrode. These results support the approach to the preparation of N-doped porous carbons with catalytically active M-N-x-C-y(M is transition metal) sites for high-rate, long-lifespan sulfur cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Herein, by loading 70 wt% sulfur into a pyrene-based 2D COF (Py-COF), we succeeded in the construction of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with high-rate capacity and long-term stability. The Py-COF/S cathode can deliver a reversible capacity of 481.2 mA h g(-1) for up to 550 cycles at 5.0C (1C = 1680 mA g(-1)), which is 73.8% of the initial capacity with a decay rate of 0.048% per cycle. This is a benchmark among all reported COF-based Li-S batteries, and more impressively, even beyond the performances of some porous carbon-based sulfur host electrodes. Specifically, by using commercially available porous carbon BP2000 as the sulfur host under the same conditions, the thus-prepared electrode can only exhibit a reversible capacity of 265 mA h g(-1) after 220 cycles at 5.0C, much lower than that of the Py-COF/S electrode. According to cyclic voltammetry analysis, this high performance could be attributed to the fast lithium ion transport in the pores of Py-COF, especially at a high rate. These results clearly demonstrate that it is reasonable to design a 2D COF sulfur host for high performance Li-S batteries.

Electrocatalytic Cathodes Based on Cobalt Nanoparticles Supported on Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon by Strong Electrostatic Adsorption for Advanced Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							BIMETALLIC NANOPARTICLES; PERFORMANCE; POLYSULFIDES; IMPREGNATION; COMPOSITES; ELECTRODE; SPHERES	Energy demands have increased rapidly over the previous decades, leading to new innovations in the energy storage field. One of the candidates for advanced energy storage is the lithium-sulfur battery. This Li-S battery is advantageous for its relatively high volumetric and gravimetric energy density and affordability. However, the widespread use and manufacturing of Li-S batteries are hampered by accelerated capacity decay upon cycling due to volume changes at the cathode, a "shuttle effect" of soluble lithium polysulfide (LPS) dissolution from cathode, and kinetically sluggish redox processes. In this study, we have designed a new and unique electrocatalytic cathode composed of ultrasmall cobalt nanoparticles embedded into nitrogen-doped porous carbon to host sulfur for the application of Li-S batteries via strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA). The large surface area (SA(BET) = 2355 m(2) g(-1)) and uniform distribution of ultrafine cobalt nanoparticles embedded in the nitrogen-doped carbon composite enables a high sulfur loading and significantly immobilizes soluble LPS during battery cycling while improving the electrochemical performance through catalytic effects. A sulfur doping of 71 wt % was attained, affording an initial specific capacity of 1219 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 degrees C (1C = 1675 mAh g(-1)) and Coulombic efficiency (99.1%) due to the cathodic multifunctional arrangements. At 0.5 degrees C, the battery initially yields a specific capacity of 968 mAh g(-1) and decreases to 858 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles. The battery delivered a specific capacity of 579 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1 C and an exceptionally low capacity fade of 0.07% per cycle. This study demonstrates that SEA can be utilized to incorporate highly active metal nanoparticles into sulfur hosts to advance their electrocatalytic function and thereby advance Li-S batteries' stability.

The rational designed structure of HCNx retards diffusion of lithium polysulfides by both chemisorption and physical confinement. The enhanced conductivity of HCNx improves the utilization of the sulfur. As a result, the S/HCNx exhibits a discharge capacity of 579 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles with a fade rate of 0.076% per cycle at 0.5 C. Even at 2 C, the S/HCNx cathode still exhibits a reversible discharge capacity of 658 mA h g(-1).

The unique properties and potential applications of graphene nanoshells with well-defined small cavities and delicately designed graphene shells are strongly considered. Herein, a mesoscale approach to fabricate graphene nanoshells with a single or few graphene layers and quite small diameters through a catalytic self-limited assembly of nanographene on in situ formed nanoparticles was proposed. The graphene nanoshells with a diameter of ca. 1030 nm and a pore volume of 1.98 cm(3) g(-1) were employed as hosts to accommodate the sulfur for high-rate lithiumsulfur batteries. A very high initial discharge capacity of 1520 mAh g(-1), corresponding to 91% sulfur utilization rate at 0.1 C, was achieved on a graphene nanoshell/sulfur composite with 62 wt % loading. A very high retention of 70% was maintained when the current density increased from 0.1 C to 2.0 C, and an ultraslow decay rate of 0.06% per cycle during 1000 cycles was detected.

The double confine by Ni foam and pencil-plating graphite makes the cathode high performance. The mechanical physical method was applied to prepare the S cathode at room temperature without using binder and conductive additives. The sulfur mass loading was controlled between 0.42 and 3.32 mg/cm(2) in the cathode piece. The optimized cathode of 0.42 mg/cm(2) S on Ni foam displayed high initial discharge capacity (1412 mAh/g at 1C), long cycle stability (1014 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 1C, S 1.05 mg/m(2) ), and high rate capability (495 mAh/g at 2C, S 1.15 mg/cm(2) ). This rapid, simple, one-step cathode preparation method may pave a new practical way for mass production of high-performances S cathode materials in lithium-sulfur battery technology.

J	Kiai, MS; Kizil, H				Kiai, Maryam Sadat; Kizil, Huseyin			Functionalized Double Side Coated Separator for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries with Enhanced Cycle Life	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							S BATTERIES; CATHODE MATERIAL; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; COMPOSITE; POLYSULFIDE; ELECTROLYTE; CHALLENGES; STABILITY	Lithium-sulfur batteries are increasingly being investigated due to their high theoretical energy density in comparison to lithium-ion batteries. However, their performance is hindered by the dissolution of polysulfides in liquid electrolytes causing the shuttle effect, which then leads to capacity fading due to loss of active material. Here we report glass fiber separators with both sides coated and doped to suppress the shuttle effect thus restrain the capacity fading and achieve long cycle life. Cathode-facing side is coated with potassium functionalized graphene nanoplates doped with Poly 1,5 diaminoanthraquinone, titanium dioxide, or cyltrimethylammonium bromide, while anode-facing side is coated with potassium functionalized graphene nanoplates (K-FGF) doped with Poly 1,5 diaminoanthraquinone (PDAAQ). Liquid graphene oxide and PVDF binder in NMP solvent are used as a binder alternatively. Electrochemical performances of the batteries with these double side coated separators are tested and compared. It is found that the battery with titanium dioxide(TiO2) doped K-FGF coated separator on the cathode-facing side exhibits high capacity retention of 1191 mAh g(-1) and 1237 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C and 0.5 C rates respectively. The cell with cyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) doped K-FGF coated separator on the cathode-facing side displays capacity retention of 1189 and 1011 mAh g(-1) over 200 cycles for 0.5 C and 1 C respectively. In both cases liquid graphene oxide (L-GO) is used as a binder in the cathode-facing side and PVDF binder in NMP solvent is added at the anode-facing side. (c) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

Here, polypyrrole-encapsulated amorphous Bi2S3 hollow spheres are prepared by the sulfuration of Bi-glycol spheres with a polypyrrole (PPy) coating. Benefiting from the unique hollow structure (Kirkendall effect) and the excellent conductivity and flexibility of the PPy coating, this material can be applied in both SIBs and Li-S batteries. For SIBs, the unconductive amorphous Bi2S3 is electrochemically reduced to conductive metallic Bi, leading to a Bi-PPy core-shell structure. The resulting Bi acts as the main active material while the PPy coating accommodates the volume variation of Bi during sodiation/desodiation. For Li-S batteries, the outer double layer structure effectively prevents the dissolution and shuttle effect of polysulfides by physically containing and chemically adsorbing polysulfides, and tolerates the volume expansion of sulfur. Meanwhile, the residual polyvinyl pyrrolidone in the preparation process is chemically bonded with sulfur and exhibits the electrochemical properties, and results in additional discharging/charging capacity. Thus, this multifunctional electrode shows excellent rate capability and cycling life in SIBs and Li-S batteries. This work provides new insight into the design of multifunctional electrodes.

However, whether and how such a polar carbon surface affects the overall cathode performance, particularly the initial discharge corresponding to the reduction of cyclooctasulfur (S-8), has not caught enough attention. By combining polar and nonpolar carbon matrix surfaces in different configurations through sandwiching sulfur species between two carbon matrix membranes, we found cells with dramatically different performance. The discharge process at different states, particularly the charge-transfer resistances corresponding to nonpolar S8 and polar polysulfide intermediates and the final Li2S, were investigated. The experimental results, further supported by first principles density functional theory calculations, indicate that the adsorption energy and barrier for electron transfer together affect the electrochemical performance of LSBs, and therefore, a rational design that combines polar and nonpolar surfaces should be adopted.

In order to further address this issue, a functionalized PP separator is obtained through selective single-sided chemical tailoring, and then organosiloxane fumigation grafting. During the charge-discharge process, the grafted functional groups can effectively block the transportation of the dissolved polysulfides through strong chemical anchoring, inhibit the shuttle effect and greatly enhance the cycle stability of the Li-S battery. Interestingly, the specially designed single-sided enlarged channel structure formed by chemical tailoring can well accommodate the deposition with intermediate polysulfides on the separator surface toward the cathode chamber, resulting in enhanced initial discharge capacity and rate performance. Compared to the battery assembled with PP, the Li-S battery employing the separator grafted with a 3-ureidopropyltrimethoxysilane (PP-Ox--U) displays better electrochemical performance. Even at 2C, it can still deliver a high capacity of 786 mA h g(-1), and retain a capacity of 410 mA h g(-1) with a low capacity fading of 0.095% per cycle over 500 cycles. This work provides a very promising and feasible strategy for the development of a special functionalization PP separator for Li-S batteries with high electrochemical performance.

The GO interlayer is bifunctional and capable for lithium storage and polysulfide trapping depending on the specific surface properties. The corresponding electrochemical behaviors were evaluated by using galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A series of GO with different oxidation degrees were synthesized by tuning modified Hummer's method. The results revealed that hydroxyl was formed at insufficient oxidation while epoxide appeared at strong oxidation. The residual graphitic structures in weakly oxidized GO can donate electrons to improve polysulfide utilization while the enriched oxygen functional groups can react with lithium ion giving rise to higher cathode capacity.

The search for a host material that can effectively anchor sulfur to a cathode to solve the adverse effects of the shuttle effect on batteries has become a research hotspot in the academic world. Here, we propose a three-dimensional heterostructure of V(2)O(5)nanotube arrays vertically grown on V2C-MXenes as a sulfur-supporting host material for the cathode of lithium-sulfur batteries. Through first-principles calculations, we found that V2O5@V2C exhibits an extreme adsorption capacity for polysulfides. Besides, thanks to the excellent catalytic performance of V(2)O(5)for oxidation reactions, the conversion reaction potential of polysulfides to Li2S and Li(2)S(2)is significantly reduced, and the shuttle effect of lithium-sulfur batteries is effectively suppressed. Also, the larger specific surface area and tubular structure of the composite host material can increase the sulfur loading of the cathode while ensuring the stability of the electrode structure. The V2O5@V2C/S electrode exhibits higher initial capacity (1173 mA h g(-1)at 0.2C), longer cycle life (1000 cycles with 0.047% decay per period), and higher sulfur loading (8.4 mg cm(-2)). We believe that this work can provide a reference for the design of cathode host materials for lithium-sulfur batteries with long cycle life.

To address this shortcoming, we prepared two types of semihollow core-shell nanoparticles in which (1) elemental sulfur is encapsulated within a porous silica shell (S@SiO2) and (2) elemental sulfur is encapsulated within a porous silica shell where the inner surface of the shell is decorated with small Au nanoparticles (S@Au@SiO2). These core-shell nanoparticles, both similar to 300 nm in diameter, were generated from analogous zinc sulfide-based core-shell nanoparticles (ZnS@SiO2 and ZnS@Au@ iO(2), respectively) by converting the ZnS cores to elemental sulfur upon treatment with Fe(NO3)(3). With a high surface area and strong host-polysulfide interaction, the SiO2 shells effectively trap the polysulfides; moreover, the internal void space of these nanostructures accommodates the volume expansion of the sulfur core upon lithiation. By decorating similar to 5-7 nm Au nanoparticles evenly on the inner surface of the porous SiO2 shells (i.e., S@Au@SiO2), electron transport is enhanced, with consequently enhanced sulfur conversion kinetics at high current rates. Studies of battery performance showed that the S@SiO2 cathode can deliver an initial capacity of 1153 mA h g(-1) under 0.2 C and retain 816 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. More importantly, the Au-decorated S@Au@SiO2 cathode can deliver a high capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) under 5 C.	[Liu, Tingting; Marquez, Maria D.; Hung-Vu Tran; Lee, T.

To alleviate these two important problems simultaneously, we modified the separators with spherical rutile TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (abbreviated OT) and three-dimensional interconnected graphene-like carbon (abbreviated GC) for advanced Li-S batteries to improve the electrochemical performance. The modified separators (abbreviation OTCD) have low charge transfer impedance, a catalytic effect on polysulfides, and a barrier effect on polysulfides, which can suppress the 'shuttle effect' and prevents the corrosion of lithium anodes in Li-S batteries. The as-prepared Li-S batteries show good cycling stability for 250 cycles with 0.048 % capacity decay per cycle at 1 C. Moreover, the SEM images of lithium anodes after 50 cycles showed that the lithium anodes were uncorroded. This work provides a practical and effective reference for the advanced Li-S batteries.

Nevertheless, it is still desired to find electrode structures that address those issues through an easy synthesis while securing large sulfur contents (i.e., > 70 wt %). Here, we report an orthogonal, "one-pot" synthetic approach to prepare a sulfur-embedded polybenzoxazine (S-BOP) with a high sulfur content of 72 wt %. This sulfur-embedded polymer was achieved via thermal ring-opening polymerization of benzoxazine in the presence of elemental sulfur, and the covalent attachment of sulfur to the polymer was rationally directed through the thiol group of benzoxazine. Also, the resulting S-B OP bears a homogeneous distribution of sulfur due to in situ formation of the polymer backbone. This unique internal structure endows S-BOP with high initial Coulombic efficiency (96.6%) and robust cyclability (92.7% retention after 1000 cycles) when tested as a sulfur cathode.

The discovery of new carbon sources, design of novel porous carbon structures, and effective hetero-atom doping of the sulfur matrix are key to overcome this dilemma. In this paper, a boron-doped porous carbon material with a termite nest shape (TNPBC) was obtained from a new carbon source, polyaspartic acid, and borax. Importantly, the doping, activation, and pyrolysis were integrated into one step through a low cost and simple methodology. The borax was essential to formation of a high surface porous architecture and provided boron dopants, which, combined with polyaspartic acid, achieves co-doping (B and N) carbon materials with special porous structures. The simultaneous pore-formation and doping leave an abundance of hetero-atoms exposed on the surface of pores, which enhances the electrostatic interactions between the hetero-atoms and the charged species in the batteries. As a result, the S/TNPBC cathode maintains a stable capacity of 703 mAh g(-1) with an excellent Coulombic efficiency of 101.3% after 120 cycles at 0.1C. Moreover, it exhibits an excellent rate capability with an initial capacity of 650 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and sustains a capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. Furthermore, when TNPBC is used as the anode in a sodium ion battery, an excellent rate capability is achieved. The specific charge capacity is three times greater than without boron doping at 500 InA g(-1). Due to the simple fabrication process and desirable properties of this novel architecture, TNPBC provides a new strategy for enhancing the performance of commercial energy storage devices.

In this work, a tube-in-tube carbon structure is demonstrated to relieve the critical problems with sulfur cathode: poor electrical conductivity, dissolution of lithium polysulfides, and large volume change during cycling. A number of small carbon nanotubes (similar to 10 nm in diameter) and a high loading amount of 85.2 wt % sulfur are both filled completely inside a large amorphous carbon nanotube (similar to 100 nm in diameter). Owing to the presence of these electrically conductive, highly flexible and structurally robust small CNTs and a large CNT overlayer, sulfur material exhibits a high utilization rate and delivers a large discharge capacity of 1633 mAh g(-1) (based on the mass of sulfur) at 0.1 C, approaching its theoretical capacity (1673 mAh g(-1)). The obtained S-CNTs@CNT electrode demonstrates superior high-rate cycling performances. Large discharge capacities of similar to 1146, 1121, and 954 mAh g(-1) are observed after 150 cycles at large current rates of 1, 2, and S C, respectively.

In order to minimize this serious issue caused by the active material dissolution, transition metal compounds such as oxides, nitrides, and sulfides have alternatively been used to capture the PS and also to provide electron pathways in the S electrode. However, high-performance additive materials having both high affinity to PS and high electronic conductivity have not been developed thus far. Herein, we report the preparation and application of a new additive material-titanium(III) sulfide (Ti2S3) nanoparticles covered with multicomponent (Ti-S-O) oxide (MO-Ti2S3), which can be synthesized on a large scale using an inductively-coupled thermal plasma synthesis method followed by a simple surface oxidation treatment. MO-Ti2S3 shows much higher PS affinity than other titanium compounds and electronic conductivity that is comparable to that of carbon black. Furthermore, MO-Ti2S3 shows much higher resistance to heat and oxidation while having charge-discharge stability when compared with TiS2. Finally, we show that the cyclability and specific capacity of the Li-S battery can be significantly enhanced by incorporating MO-Ti2S3 in the cathode when compared to utilizing C species.

In this paper, a novel sulfur-host material was synthesized by a simple method. The sulfur-host material used reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the synergistic conductive skeleton and nano-Fe2O3 as the adsorbent of lithium polysulfides. Finally, the as-prepared Fe2O3/rGO/CNT/S cathode material exhibits stable cycling performance and excellent ionic and electronic conductivities. The initial specific capacity of Fe2O3/rGO/CNT/S is 963 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C, and the capacity remains to be 758 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles. The average specific capacities of Fe2O3/rGO/CNT/S are 999 mA h g(-1), 901 mA h g(-1) and 825 mA h g(-1), respectively, at different rates of 0.2C, 0.5C and 1C, with good rate performance. The initial specific capacity of Fe2O3/rGO/CNT/S is 899 mA h g(-1) at 2C. After 400 cycles, the capacity remains to be 521 mA h g(-1), and the capacity decay rate is only 0.1% per cycle. This structure provides a reference for developing lithium-sulfur battery cathode materials with excellent performance.

J	Zhao, JG				Zhao Jinguo			High capacity and long cycle stability lithium-sulfur battery by using hollow Co3O4 nanofibers as host materials	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS			English	Article						hollow Co3O4 nanofiber; capacity; cycle stability; electrochemical performance	CARBON; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; COMPOSITE; CONVERSION; SPHERES; FACILE; FIBERS; MATRIX; ANODE	Developing long cycle stability lithium-sulfur battery has become hot topic for the researchers all over the world. But due to the dissolution and the shuttle effect of the polar polysulfide, lithium-sulfur batteries suffer from severe capacity fade during the electrochemical process. Metal oxides play a key role in improving the electrochemical performance, which is ascribed to its chemical affinity between the polar metal oxide and polysulfide. In our work, hollow Co3O4 nanofibers are synthesized and designed as host materials for the element sulfur. The electrochemical results show that the as-prepared hollow Co3O4 nanofiber-sulfur composite (HCON-S) exhibits high capacity and superior cycle stability.

However, production of conventional aerogels in a monolithic form remains problematic, because of risk of explosive polymerization, tedious supercritical/freeze drying steps, extra ball milling, and difficulty in controlling micro/nanostructures. Here we show that novel powdery carbon aerogels and their polymer aerogel precursors have been developed by utilizing shape-persistent nanoparticles as building blocks, followed by hypercrosslinking for forming a well-defined 3D interconnected nanonetwork with numerous interstitial nanopores and intraparticle micropores. The resulting aerogels are in a microscale powdery form. The preparation route is much more feasible for scaling up, due to avoidance of explosive polymerization and facile drying at ambient pressure. By simple carbonization, powdery carbon aerogels can be obtained with a high surface area of 2052 m(2) g(-1). Benefiting from structural advantages, the aerogels demonstrate excellent electrochemical performances in supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur batteries.

Herein, we have designed and synthesized a unique metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived NiO-NiCo2O4@PPy hollow polyhedral structure material as an efficient sulfur immobilizer for lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). The NiO-NiCo2O4@PPy structure effectively alleviates volume expansion, increases electronic conductivity, and enhances the binding effect on lithium polysulfides by chemical fixation. The S/NiO-NiCo2O4@PPy composite displays a high initial discharge capacity of 963 mA h g(-1) with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 95.2% at a low current density of 0.2C. In addition, this sample exhibits good cycling performance at a high current density of 1C. All the results show that this design strategy has great potential to promote the design of MOF-derived materials for LSBs.

Herein, we systematically study the polysulfide-binding ability and the decomposition energy barrier of Li2S enabled by different kinds of nitrogen (pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N) and phosphorus (P-O, P=O and graphitic P) doping and decipher their inherent modulation effect. The doping process helps in forming a graphene-like structure and increases the micropores/mesopores, which can expose more active sites to come into contact with polysulfides. First-principles calculations reveal that the P=O possesses the highest binding energies with polysulfides due to the weakening of the chemical bonds. Besides, P=O as a promoter is beneficial for the free diffusion of lithium ions, and the pyridinic N and pyrrolic N can greatly reduce the kinetic barrier and catalyze the polysulfide conversion. The synergetic effects of nitrogen and phosphorus as bifunctional active centers help in achieving an in situ adsorption-diffusion-conversion process of polysulfides. Benefiting from these features, the graphene-like network achieves superior rate capability (a high reversible capacity of 954 mA h g(-1) at 2C) and long-term stability (an ultralow degradation rate of 0.009% around 800 cycles at 5C). Even at a high sulfur loading of 5.6 mg cm(-2), the cell can deliver an areal capacity of 4.6 mA h cm(-2) at 0.2C.

How to effectively combine physical confinement and chemical catalysis has become the focus of research. Herein, micro-mesoporous carbon (MMC) embedded with well-dispersed ultrafine CoS2 (uCoS(2)) nanocrystals as an efficient sulfur host is presented. As expected, the obtained S/uCoS(2)@MMC cathode can achieve a synergistic effect of physical confinement and chemical catalysis of LiPSs through micro-mesoporous structures and well-dispersed uCoS(2) nanocrystals. Furthermore, the MMC with a high conductive specific surface area, uniform pore size and micro-mesoporous structure can realize homogeneous loading of sulfur and physical adsorption of LiPSs. Owing to these excellent qualities, the S/uCoS(2)@MMC cathode delivers outstanding initial capacities up to 1227 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C. More significantly, a capacity of 606 mA h g(-1) is maintained after 1000 cycles at 1C (a very low capacity decay rate of only 0.032% per cycle). It can be seen that the MMC embedded with well-dispersed uCoS(2) nanocrystals as the sulfur host has great application prospects in Li-S batteries.

However, conundrums such as severe polarization, poor cyclic performance originating from shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics are stumbling blocks for their practical application. Herein, a novel sulfur cathode integrating sulfur and polyvinylpyrrolidone(PVP)-derived N-doped porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) with embedded CoF3 and YF3 nanoparticles are designed and prepared though the electrostatic blowing technology and carbonization process. The unique flexible PCNFs with embedded polar CoF3 and YF3 nanoparticles not only offer enough voids for volume expansion to maintain the structural stability during the electrochemical process, but also promote the physical encapsulation and chemical entrapment of all sulfur species. Moreover, the uniform distribution of YF3/CoF3 nanoparticles also can expose more binding active sites to lithium polysulfide and present more catalytic sites to the greatest extent. Therefore, the assembled cells with the prepared cathode exhibited stable performances with an outstanding initial capacity of 1055.2 mAh g(-1) and an extended cycling stability of 0.029% per cycle during the 300 cycles at 0.5C. Even at a high sulfur loading of 2.1 mg cm(-2), The YF3/CoF3 doped-PCNFs exhibited a high discharge specific capacity of 1038 mAh g(-1), and the decay rate is also as low as 0.05% over 1000 cycles. This work shares a convenient and safe strategy for the synthesis of multi-dimension, dual-functional and stable superstructure electrode for advanced Li-S batteries.

In order to maximize its practical energy density, a novel cauliflower-like hierarchical porous C/S cathode was designed, for facilitating the lithium-ions transport and sulfur accommodation. This kind of cathode could release about 1300 mAh g(-1) (S) capacity at sulfur loading of 6 similar to 14 mg cm(-2), and showed excellent shelf stability during a month test at room temperature. As a result, the assembled Li-S soft package battery achieved an energy density of 504 Wh kg(-1) (654 Wh L-1), which was the highest value ever reported to the best of our knowledge.

A high-energy, low-temperature lithium-sulfur flow battery enabled by an amphiphilic-functionalized suspension catholyte	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Flow battery; Sulfur utilization; Amphiphilic; High energy density; Low temperature battery	CARBON NANOTUBES; METAL-FREE; ONE-STEP; PERFORMANCE; ELECTROLYTE; CHEMISTRY; CATHODE; STORAGE; DENSITY; SURFACE	Lithium-sulfur flow batteries show great superiority in large-scale energy storage. However, the sulfur utilization in high sulfur loading suspension catholyte declines sharply due to the insulating nature of sulfur/sulfides. Adding more carbon conductive materials can augment sulfur utilization, while high carbon content limits the specific energy and meanwhile increases the viscosity of suspension catholyte. In this work, a high-energy, low-temperature sulfur suspension catholyte is designed and prepared based on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) functionalized Sulfur-Ketjenblack-Graphene composite (S-KB-G@P). Amphiphilic PVP is anchored onto the surface of graphene to enhance contact between polar sulfur species and conductive network constructed by nonpolar graphene and KB, and then facilitate the redox reaction of sulfur catholyte. Meanwhile, anchored PVP endows S-KB-G nanoparticles with well-dispersed characteristics, which reduces the viscosity and accelerates the ion transfer in highly concentrated S-KBG@P suspension. The S-KB-G@P suspension catholyte exhibits high sulfur utilization of 89.5% and volumetric energy of 718 W h L-1; moreover, high energy density of 445 W h L-1 and excellent cycle stability are achieved at -30 degrees C. Verified in a laboratory flow cell, the strategy offers a new opportunity to develop high-energy flow batteries by amphiphilic functionalization in cold-climate region. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, poor electrical conductivity of sulfur/discharged products, low active material utilization, shuttle mechanism, and poor cycle life remain the major challenges for the development of Li-S batteries. Herein, we report the nitrogen-doped highly porous carbon (NC) with interconnected pores as the sulfur host (NC-S), which is synthesized by a facile one-step process without using any template and activation agents. The highly interconnected porous structure of NC can accommodate a high amount of sulfur loading and provide space for sulfur volume expansion during redox reactions. Besides, to mitigate the lithium polysulfide dissolution and shuttle mechanism, metallic and polar magnesium diboride (MgB2) is used as an interlayer. Consequently, the NC-S/MgB2 cathode delivers higher specific capacity, rate capability, and excellent cyclic stability than the NC-S cathode and bulk sulfur cathode with MgB2 interlayer. The lithium polysulfide (LPS) adsorption test shows that MgB2 has strong chemisorption toward lithium polysulfides, which can inhibit the dissolution of LPS into the electrolyte and minimizes the shuttle effect. The dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis investigates the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the NC-S/MgB2 cathode during the charging and discharging processes. Overall, this work demonstrates that the synergy between the nitrogen-doped porous carbon-sulfur host and polar metallic MgB2 improves the performance of the Li-S battery, which is beneficial for the development of high-energy-density batteries for the future.

However, the road to commercialization of lithium sulfur batteries remains limited owing to the "shuttle effect" of soluble polysulfides, which results in the inferior cycle stability. Herein, a potent functional separator is developed to restrain the "shuttle effect" by coating Co2B@carbon nanotube layer on the commercialized polypropylene separator. In merits of the coadsorption of Co sites and B sites, such Co2B shows highly efficient polysulfides block (11.67 mg/m(2) for Li2S6). Besides, the composite also exhibits obviously catalysis from Li2S8 to Li2S. By combining the fast electron transportation along the carbon the modified separator and common carbon-sulfur cathode. Typically, the cell with Co2B@CNT shows prominent cycling life with a capacity degradation of 0.0072% per cycle (3000 cycles) and ultrahigh-rate capability at 5 C current (1172.8 mAh/g), which outstands the previously reported polysulfides barrier layer. The cell with Co2B@CNT can exhibit electrochemical performance at areal capacity of 5.5 mAh/cm(2) (0.5 C) when the sulfur loading increased to 5.8 mg/cm(2). This work defines an efficacious strategy to restrain the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides and shed light on the great potential of borides in Li-S battery.

Despite the great progress achieved recently, the practical application of Li-S batteries still faces several critical challenges, i.e, low capacities, low coulombic efficiency and rapid capacity decay during cycling. These problems mainly originate from the reasons of: (i) the poor intrinsic electrical conductivity of sulfur and Li2S decreasing the utilization of sulfur, (ii) the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide intermediates losing active components, (iii) the large volumetric change pulverizing electrode during cycling, which become more Wand more serious when the sulfur loading is increased to the practical level of 3 similar to 5 mg.cm(-2). To address these issues, some approaches have been developed, including hybridizing sulfur with hi. hybridizing highly conductive materials to enhance the conductivity, encapsulating sulfur in porous materials to inhibit the loss of poly sulfides and accommodate the volumetric expansion, blending sulfur with polar materials to restrain the diffusion of polysulfides by chemical interaction. Recently, our group reported the mesostructured cathode material of sulfur-filled carbon nanocages (S@hCNC), which demonstrated the large capacity, high-rate capability and long cycle life owing to unique mesostructured feature, physical confinement, good conductivity and coexisting micro-mesomacropores. However, the non-polar sp(2) carbons only have weak interaction with polar polysulfides. The introduction of chemical adsorption sites for poly sulfides through heteroatom doping or surface modification can obviously enhance the interaction between the host and lithium polysulfides, thus further improving the cycling stability. Herein, we report the free-standing monolithic materials of reduced graphene oxide wrapped S@heNC (S@heNC@rGO), which can be directly used as the cathode without using binders, conductive materials and current collector. The S@hCNC@rGO battery with the high areal sulfur loading of 3.8 mg.cm(-2) delivers excellent electrochemical performances surpassing the counterpart of S@hCNC, e.g, high reversible specific capacity (1104 mAh.g(-1)@0.2 A.g(-1)), superior cycle stability (low degradation rate of 0.049% per-cycle@1.0 Al.g(-1)), high coulombic efficiency (>99.9%) and the top-ranking areal capacity of 3.7 mAh.cm(-2). Such excellent electrochemical performances can be ascribed to the synergism of the physical confinement of hCNC, the chemical adsorption of oxygen functional groups on rGO, the accelerated charge transfer kinetics arising from the hierarchical porous structure and high electrical conductivity, and the free-standing structure with high stability. This study also suggests a simple and efficient method to develop sulfur cathode with high areal capacity, which pave a way for the practical application of Li-S batteries.

To allow the energy density of Li-S batteries comparable to that of commercial Li-ion batteries, the areal capacity of sulfur cathode should be above 4 mA.h.cm(-2). In general, a high sulfur loading often causes rapid capacity fading by slowing electron/ion transport kinetics, catastrophic shuttle effect and even cracking the electrodes. To address this issue, herein, a multilevel structured carbon film is built by covering highly conductive CNTs and hollow carbon nanofiber together with carbon layer via chemical vapor deposition. The self-standing carbon film exhibits well-interweaved conductive network, hollow fibrous structure and abundant N, O co-doped active sites, which combine the merits of high electronic conductivity (1200.S.m(-1)), high porosity and polar characteristic in one host. Benefiting from this attractive multilevel structure, the obtained sulfur cathode based on the carbon film host shows an ultra-high areal capacity of 8.9 mA.h.cm(-2) at 0.2 C with outstanding cyclability over 60 cycles. This work shed light on designing advanced sulfur host for Li-S batteries with high areal capacity and high cycle stability, and might make a contribution to the commercialization of Li-S batteries.

Nevertheless, as one of the pivotal problems, the shuttling of soluble polysulfide intermediates hinders its practical application. In this work, we employ an electronic conductive carbon material and a lithium ion conductive block polymer (lithium sulfonated poly(styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene), Li+-SSEBS) to fabricate a functional separator by a simple coating method. The functional coating on the PP separator exhibits excellent electronic conductivity for reactivating the active materials, good lithium ion conductivity for facilitating lithium ion transport, and great ionic selectivity for the suppressing polysulfide shuttle. With this separator, the battery shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1066 mAh g(-1) and excellent capacity retention of 762.7 mAh g(-1) after 350 cycles at 0.5 C. It also exhibits excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 750 mAh g(-1) at 2 C and good recovery capability. Furthermore, a correction strategy has been adopted to investigate the anti-self-discharge behavior of Li-S battery, which is more reasonable and precise than reported method. The results demonstrate that the SEBS-based functional separator can endow the enhanced electrochemical performance and anti-self-charge capability of Li-S battery.

As-prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbon (aNPCP3) possesses a high specific surface area of 2318 m(2) g(-1) and abundant micro/meso-pores. As a result, the aNPCP3 samples have been demonstrated to be electrodes for supercapacitors, displaying a high specific capacitance of 354 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.2 A g(-1) and excellent cycling stability. Further, the aNPCP3 samples used as sulfur host materials for lithium-sulfur batteries exhibit a high capacity of 1210 mAh g(-1) and good cycling stability with a small capacity decay of about 0.1 % per cycle. Interestingly, it is found that their electrochemical performances are dependent on their specific surface area, pore structure, and heteroatom-doping content and type of carbon materials to a large extent. Cheapness, convenient resource, and good performance make these electrode materials displaying huge potential in cost-effective high-performance energy storage devices.

To achieve this goal, new analytical tools need to be developed. Herein, sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and Li-6,Li-7 magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR studies on a Li-S battery and its sulfur components are reported. The characterization of different stoichiometric mixtures of sulfur and lithium compounds (polysulfides), synthesized through a chemical route with all-sulfur-based components in the Li-S battery (sulfur and electrolyte), enables the understanding of changes in the batteries measured in postmortem mode and in operando mode. A detailed XANES analysis is performed on different battery components (cathode composite and separator). The relative amounts of each sulfur compound in the cathode and separator are determined precisely, according to the linear combination fit of the XANES spectra, by using reference compounds. Complementary information about the lithium species within the cathode are obtained by using Li-7 MAS NMR spectroscopy. The setup for the in operando XANES measurements can be viewed as a valuable analytical tool that can aid the understanding of the sulfur environment in Li-S batteries.	[Patel, Manu U.

Various smart electrode designs have lately been introduced to avoid these fading mechanisms, most of which demonstrate significantly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, an in-depth understanding on the effect of sulfur microstructure and nanoscale electron transport near sulfur is currently lacking. In this study, the authors report an organized nanocomposite comprising linear sulfur chains and oleylamine-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (O-rGO) to achieve robust cycling performance (81.7% retention after 500 cycles) as well as to investigate the reaction mechanism in different regimes, i.e., S-8 dissolution, polysulfide conversion, and Li2S formation. In the nanocomposite, linear sulfur chains terminate with 1,3-diisopropyl-benzene are covalently linked to O-rGO. The comparison with control samples that do not contain either the capping of sulfur chains or O-rGO reveals the synergistic interplay between both treatments, simultaneously unveiling the distinct roles of confined sulfur nanodomains and their adjoining electron pathways in different reaction regimes.

Two sulfur-embedded methods, S-impregnation (IS) and S-liquefied pore filling (LS), were applied for the preparation of the S-MIP carbon composites. The pristine elemental S of the polycrystalline alpha-S-8 undergoes a structural change to an amorphous-S (a-S) structure in the S-MIP carbon composite created by the IS method. During sulfur loading of 40-50 wt %, the S-MIP carbon composite created by the IS method showed a BET SSA value of around 500 m(2) g(-1) and a pore volume of 0.2 cm(3) g(-1). However, after the LS process was applied to the S-MIP carbon composite, at 160 A degrees C and 10 h, the a-S structure in the S-MIP carbon composite became recrystalline alpha-S-8. Little remained of the porosity in the S-MIP carbon composite prepared by the LS method due to the large portion of the S crystalline phase. The best discharge capacity was obtained with an S-MIP carbon composite created by the IS method, with the result of 680 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles at 0.1 A degrees C, i.e., similar to 47 % higher than that by the LS method.

Enhancing the sulfur utilization, decreasing the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and improving the electrical conductivity of the cathodes have become the main challenges for the successful commercialization of Li-S batteries. In this paper, use of novel pea-pod-like nitrogen-doped hollow porous carbon cathode hosts decorated with polar titanium dioxide nanocrystals (rod-TiO2@C) as high-efficiency polysulfide immobilizers for advanced Li-S batteries are reported. In this ingenious nanostructure, the hollow porous carbon can not only enhance the conductivity of the cathodes, but also effectively reserve sulfur species in its internal void space and the volume expansion upon lithiation can also be alleviated. More importantly, the well-dispersed polar TiO2 nanocrystals can significantly suppress the dissolution of LiPSs and accelerate the redox reaction by strong chemical interactions. With a sulfur content of 65.4 wt%, the rod-TiO2@C/S cathodes can deliver an extraordinary electrochemical performance in terms of high reversibility (1017 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C, 853 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5C), superior rate capability (605 and 509 mA h g(-1) at 8C and 10C, respectively) and excellent long-term cycle performance (728 mA h g(-1) after 1500 cycles at 1C with an extremely low capacity loss of only 0.0196% each cycle, 604 mA h g(-1) after 1500 cycles at 2C with a capacity loss of merely 0.0240% in each cycle).

Here, the synthesis of strongly coupled Fe3O4 and N-doped carbon directly in flexible carbon cloth is demonstrated, as well as their novel use for hosting sulfur with outstanding performance for Li-S batteries. It is discovered that the synergistic effects of Fe3O4 and N-carbon bring strong adsorption toward lithium polysulfide, and ensure nearly complete conversion of short-chain polysulfide to Li2S during discharge. The Li2S solids generated on these novel hosts are extremely reactive and can be readily charged back to S without a noticeable overpotential. The critical roles of Fe3O4 and N-doped carbon are studied and direct correlations are established between their surface concentration/crystallinity and the Li2S4 to Li2S conversion capacity. This novel manipulation of polysulfide conversion allows to fabricate freestanding and flexible sulfur cathodes that deliver a specific capacity of 1316 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and stable cycling for 1000 cycles at 0.2C under a high sulfur loading of approximate to 4.7 mg cm(-2).

Directly Formed Alucone on Lithium Metal for High-Performance Li Batteries and Li-S Batteries with High Sulfur Mass Loading	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						molecular layer deposition; direct coating; lithium metal batteries; high mass loading; lithium-sulfur batteries	MOLECULAR LAYER DEPOSITION; ION; ELECTROLYTE; ANODES; CARBON; STABILITY; GROWTH; AL2O3; OXIDE; LINO3	Lithium metal is considered the "holy grail" of next-generation battery anodes. However, severe parasitic reactions at the lithium-electrolyte interface deplete the liquid electrolyte and the uncontrolled formation of high surface area and dendritic lithium during cycling causes rapid capacity fading and battery failure. Engineering a dendrite-free lithium metal anode is therefore critical for the development of long life batteries using lithium anodes. In this study, we deposit a conformal, organic/inorganic hybrid coating, for the first time, directly on lithium metal using molecular layer deposition (MLD) to alleviate these problems. This hybrid organic/inorganic film with high cross-linking structure can stabilize lithium against dendrite growth and minimize side reactions, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy. We discovered that the alucone coating yielded several times longer cycle life at high current rates compared to the uncoated lithium and achieved a steady Coulombic efficiency of 99.5%, demonstrating that the highly cross linking structured material with great mechanical properties and good flexibility can effectively suppress dendrite formation. The ;protected Li was further evaluated in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with a high sulfur mass loading of similar to 5 mg/cm(2). After 140 cycles at a high current rate of similar to 1 mA/cm(2), alucone-coated Li-S batteries delivered a capacity of 657.7 mAh/g, 39.5% better than that of a bare lithium-sulfur battery. These findings suggest that flexible coating with high cross-linking structure by MLD is effective to enable lithium protection and offers a very promising avenue for improved performance in the real applications of Li-S batteries.

However, its practical applications are still facing great challenges because of poor electronic conductivity, large volume change, and polysulfides dissolution inducing "shuttle reaction" for the S cathode. Many strategies have been explored to alleviate the aforementioned concerns. The most common approach is to embed S into carbonaceous matrix for constructing C-S composite cathodes. Herein, we fabricate the C-S cathode reduced graphene oxide-S (rGO-S) composites via one step hydrothermal and in-situ thermal reduction methods. The structural features and electrochemical properties in Li-S cells of the two type rGO-S composites are studied systematically. The rGO-S composites prepared by one step hydrothermal method (rGO-S-HT) show relatively better comprehensive performance as compared with the ones by in-situ thermal reduction method (rGO-S-T). For instance, with a current density of 100 mA g(-1), the rGO-S-HT composite cathodes possess an initial capacity of 1290 mAh g(-1) and simultaneously exhibit stable cycling capability. In particular, as increasing the current density to 1.0 A g(-1), the rGO-S-HT cathode retains a reversible capacity of 582 mAh g(-1) even after 200 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical properties can be attributed to small S particles uniformly distributed on rGO sheets enabling to significantly improve the conductivity of S and effectively buffer large volume change during lithiation/delithiation.

However, the synergetic effect between amorphous metal and carbon to restrict the migration of polysulfides is still far from fully understood. Herein, two porous metal/carbon nanohybrids with different crystallinity metal oxides components (amorphous Al2O3 and crystal Fe3O4) have been prepared through pyrolysis of the MOF precursors, which are adopted as a sulfur support to impede the polysulfides shuttling. As expected, the amorphous Al2O3 with nitrogen-doped porous carbon exhibits an attractive durability at 1 C over 1000 cycles, meanwhile, the coulombic efficiency could maintain at 97.5%. Compared to it, crystal Fe3O4 shows an inferior electrochemical performance, which is attributed to the amorphous structure that can accelerate ions diffusion and charge transfer to improve the rate performance and capacity. The distinguished discharge performance of the design will be potentially used to develop applicable Li-S batteries.

This resulting composite presents hierarchical porous frameworks of mesopores together with micropores, effectively restrains soluble polysulfides and enhances mass transport. Moreover, V2O3 modification in this mono-dispersed microsphere material can trap polysulfides and mitigate loss of active materials by chemical adsorption. The S/VCM nanocomposites show a high initial discharge capacity of 1177 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C and an excellent cycling performance with 921 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles.

However, the dissolution of polysulfide causes severe capacity fading during cycling. Herein, a 3D CoO/Co-activated free-standing porous carbon fiber cloth (CoO/Co@PCF) is designed to suppress polysulfide diffusion from the cathode. The metallic Co and polar CoO can anchor polysulfide through Co-S ionic bonding and the pores of the carbon cloth can provide abundant active sites for electrochemical reactions. Specifically, sulfur in the cathode is loaded by sulfur vapor deposition, which is scalable for fabrication and adjustable to the sulfur-loading amount. The CoO/Co@PCF cathode with sulfur loading of 3 mgcm(-2) displays high discharge capacities of 1214.2 and 684.3 mAhg(-1) at 0.1 and 2C, respectively. When the sulfur loading is increased to 5.4 mgcm(-2), low capacity fading of 0.075% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.5C is still observed.

As-prepared NC@S composite was used as a cathode in a half battery cell, and it showed an excellent discharge capacity of ca. 1615.8 mAh g(-1) on the initial cycle and exhibited high cycle stability, rate capability, and coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the NC@MnS hybrid in a half battery cell exhibited an outstanding discharge capacity of ca. 1202.7 mAh g(-1) on the first cycle and showed high cycling performance and superior rate property, in comparison with bare MnS. Accordingly, while the full LSB has consisted of NC@S cathode and NC@MnS anode, it showed the high initial capacity of 1113.8 mAh g(-1) from 2.3 to 0.1 V. The improved Li (+)& nbsp;storage properties suggest that these full LSBs configurations with NC@S and NC@MnS hybrids could be prospective next generation secondary battery platforms.

Lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries have recently attracted extensive attention, where carbon matrices have been utilized to retain S content by restricting the dissolution of polysulfide into electrolytes. Here we systematically investigate S cathode upon unconfined and nanoconfined lithiation using reactive molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate the great ductility of lithiated amorphous S cathode (a-LixS) governed by overcoordination sites, as well as the resulting strengthening effect of a-LixS due to the formation of stronger Li-S bonds upon lithiation. Fracture and cavitation studies also indicate the dominant role of shear banding, which is facilitated by overcoordinated S "plastic carriers", in accommodating the plastic deformation of a-LixS under tensile loading. Based. on a chemo-mechanical yield function, we confirm two-dimensionally nanoconfined lithiation reaction can facilitate the out-of-plane inelastic deformation ("reactive flow") of a-LixS at a much lower level of biaxial stress. The atomistic understanding of lithiation behaviors of S cathodes provides fundamental insight into the optimal design of carbon-based S composite cathode with outstanding mechanical integrity, as well as the prediction of lithiation behavior of other electrode materials, such as silicon, metal oxides, and graphite.

Herein, we report a polymer with high concentration salts as a quasi-solid state electrolyte used for lithium-sulfur cells, which shows an ionic conductivity of 1.6 mS cm(-1) at room temperature. The cycling performance of Li-S battery with this electrolyte shows a long cycle life (300 cycles) and high coulombic efficiency (>98%), without any consuming additives in the electrolyte. Moreover, it also shows a remarkably decreased self-discharge (only 0.2%) after storage for two weeks at room temperature. The reason can be attributed to that the electrolyte can suppress polysulfide anions diffusion, due to the high ratio oxygen atoms with negative charges which induce an electrical repulsion to the polysulfide anions, and their relatively long chains which can provide additional steric hindrance. Thus, the polysulfide anions can be located around carbon particles, which result in remarkably improved overall electrochemical performance, and also the electrolyte have a function of suppress the formation of lithium dendrites on the lithium anode surface.

Thus, in this work, a type of distorted NiAs-type structured V(2)S(3)phase was designed and attempted to use it as a sulfur host for LSBs. The results showed that the prepared V2S3-nanocrystal decorated carbon nanofiber (CNF@V2S3) electrode films are freestanding, highly conductive and flexible. And the resultant CNF@V2S3/S cathodes show a high specific capacity (1169 mA h g(-1)at 0.1C), an excellent rate capability (retain 78.9% at 2.0C), an ultra-low delay rate per cycle of 0.0071%, and a low self-discharge rate of 3.65% per month. A series of analyses indicate that these high electrochemical performances are mainly due to the high polarity, high conductivity and high catalytic activity of V(2)S(3)nanocrystals, as well as the improved diffusivities of Li ions. This research could provide some new insight into the design of sulfur host materials for high-performance LSBs.

Current technologies for sulfur cathodes by physical confinement and chemical absorptions are not enough to solve the issues of the sulfur cathodes. Organosulfur cathodes with solid-solid conversions were proposed to fundamentally avoid shuttle effect. However, in previous reports, low sulfur content and complicated electrochemical process prevent application of organosulfur cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we report new solid-solid conversion based on the organosulfur cathodes in ether-based electrolytes by developing sulfur-chain controlling strategy to obtain trisulfide polymers with high sulfur content over 76 wt%. Furthermore, reaction mechanism of sulfur based cathodes is analyzed by constructing different sulfur chains based on the strategy. Theoretical calculations suggest polymers with disulfide bonds might exhibit new lithiation behavior, which is consistent with electrochemical results. This work demonstrates new electrochemical behavior of organosulfur cathode with solid-solid conversion and show promising application prospect of these polymers.

The carbon nanofibers obtained by carbonization of bacterial cellulose are interweaved with each other, and can provide a firm 3D conductive skeleton for the low-conductive sulfur cathode. And the N-doping carbon nanofibers skeleton with polar CoS2 can achieve synergetic physical/chemical adsorption of polysulfides and effective catalytic conversion, which are contributed to enhance sulfur redox kinetic and effectively suppress the shuttling effect. Moreover, the skeleton with abundant -OH functional groups achieve strong chemisorption to CoS2, greatly maintaining structural stability during cycling process. Benefitting from the above-mentioned merits, CoS2/N-CNFs@S electrode with high sulfur loading of 74.4% exhibits superior reversible capacity of 497.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 100 cycles with an improved coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%, and the electrode has excellent cycle life with 73% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 0.5 C.

In this study, we propose a novel structured spherical carbon with a macrohollow core and a microporous shell derived from a sustainable biomass, amylose, by a multistep pyrolysis route without chemical etching. This hierarchically porous carbon shows a particle distribution of 2-10 mu m and a surface area of 672 m(2) g(-1). The structure is an effective host of sulfur for lithium sulfur battery cathodes, which reduces the dissolution of polysulfides in the electrolyte and offers high electrical conductivity during discharge/charge cycling. The hierarchically porous carbon can hold 48 wt % sulfur in its porous structure. The S@C hybrid shows an initial capacity of 1490 rnAh g(-1) and retains a capacity of 798 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at a discharge/charge rate of 0.1 C. A capacity of 487 rnAh g(-1) is obtained at a rate of 3 C. Both a one-step pyrolysis and a chemical-reagent-assisted pyrolysis are also assessed to obtain porous carbon from amylose, but the obtained carbon shows structures inferior for sulfur cathodes. The multistep pyrolysis and the resulting hierarchically porous carbon offer an effective approach to the engineering of biomass for energy storage. The micrometer-sized spherical S@C hybrid with different sizes is also favorable for high-tap density and hence the volumetric density of the batteries, opening up a wide scope for practical applications.

However, the shuttle effect and sluggish conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are still thorny issues for its practical application. Here, an efficient three-dimensional conductive CoS2/rGO aerogel is constructed and used as a trapping-catalyst sulfur host to improve the overall performance of Li-S batteries. CoS2 nanoparticles, uniformly in-situ anchored on rGO sheets, provide strong trapping ability to LiPSs and then catalyze its conversion, thus inhibiting the shuttle effect and accelerating the reaction kinetics. Highly conductive porous rGO aerogel ensures fast ion and electron transfer for electrochemical reaction and electrocatalysis process. As a result, the electrode exhibits a high initial capacity of 1457 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, superior high-rate capability of 1156 mAh g(-1) at 2 C, ultra-low capacity decay rate per cycle of 0.04% at 1 C for 400 cycles, and a high areal capacity of 5.7 mA h cm(-2) (high sulfur loading of 6.37 mg cm(-2)).

In particular, the battery performance of nanoscale (Li2S)(n) clusters is much better than that of bulk sized Li2S. However, the structures, stability, and properties of (Li2S)(n) clusters, which are very important to improve the performance of Li-S batteries, are still unexplored. Herein, the most stable structures of (Li2S)(n) (n = 1-10) are reliably determined using the advanced swarm-intelligence structure prediction method. The (Li2S)(n) (n >= 4) clusters exhibit intriguing cage-like structures, which are favorable for eliminating dangling bonds and enhancing structural stability. Compared to the Li2S monomer, each sulfur atom in the clusters is coordinated with more lithium atoms, thus lengthening the Li-S bond length and decreasing the Li-S bond activation energy. Notably, the adsorption energy gradually increases on the considered anchoring materials (AMs) as the cluster size increases. Moreover, B-doped graphene is a good AM in comparison with graphene or N-doped graphene. The predicted characteristic peaks of infrared, Raman, and electronic absorption spectra provide useful information for in situ experimental investigation. Our work represents a significant step towards understanding (Li2S)(n) clusters and improving the performance of Li-S batteries.

The present work is aimed at demonstrating a simple preparation of a bi-functional trilayer membrane by coating Li(7)La(3)Zr(2)O(12)and activated carbon on either side of the commercial membrane (Celgard 2320). The coated membrane was characterized by ionic conductivity, thermogravimetric and contact angle analyses. In the trilayer membrane, each component acts for a particular purpose: the activated carbon not only acts as a barrier for the migration of polysulfide but also provides additional pathways for electron transport for the insulating sulphur cathode, while the porous Celgard separator facilitates the migration of lithium ion, and the Li(7)La(3)Zr(2)O(12)not only promotes the lithium ion migration by percolation but also prevents polysulfide shuttlingviathe electrostatic repulsive force. The coated membrane offered higher ionic conductivity and thermal stability compared to the uncoated one. The lithium-sulfur battery with the coated separator delivered higher specific discharge capacity than the uncoated separator. XPS studies revealed the absence of polysulfide deposition on the lithium metal surface after the charge-discharge cycling, which further confirms the suppression of polysulfide shuttling by permselective membranes.

Reaction Mechanism Optimization of Solid-State Li-S Batteries with a PEO-Based Electrolyte	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; poly(ethylene oxide); polyvinylidene fluoride; reaction mechanisms; solid-state electrolytes	COMPOSITE POLYMER ELECTROLYTE; TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; IONIC-CONDUCTIVITY; LITHIUM; CARBON; INTERPHASE; CATHODE	The shuttle effect of long-chain polysulfides (Li2Sn, n = 4-8) from the multistep reactions reduces the cycling life of solid-state lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). Moreover, the ambiguous reaction mechanism of polysulfides in an SPE also limits the development of high-performance solid-state Li-S batteries. Here, a solid-state Li-S cell with a much-improved cycling performance is reported by coating the sulfur cathode with a layer of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which not only suppresses the formation of soluble polysulfides, but also changes the reaction mechanism of the sulfur from a multistep "solid-liquid-solid" reaction to a single-step "solid-solid" reaction. These results show that long-chain polysulfides are insoluble and unstable in PVDF polymers with a low solvent property, which facilitates the direct transformation of elemental sulfur to solid Li2S2/Li2S without the formation of intermediary products. However, the strong PEO-Li2Sn (n = 4-8) attraction causes a dissolution of polysulfides in PEO. The introduction of a polymer with a low solvent property in the sulfur cathode would be promising for the development of solid-state Li-S batteries with a long cycling life.

A ferroconcrete frame structure with a hierarchical 3D nanostructure composed of 1D HCNT and 2D rGO nanosheets was obtained. The rGO wraps around the HCNT to form a heterostructure and provide an apparent coating that protects S. HCNT in the composite is boosted to create a 3D network architecture and reinforce the structural stability. Moreover, the heterostructures and rGO coatings, which are rich in wrinkles, can greatly minimize direct contact between the polysulfide and electrolyte; they also provide an abundance of active sites and boundary defects. Furthermore, the 3D interconnected structure creates effective ion diffusion channels and allows effective trapping of S and Li polysulfides. When used as a cathode, the HCNT/rGO/S cathode exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 1,196 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C. The capacity decay rate of the HCNT/rGO/S is only 0.075% per cycle after cycling for 200 times at a rate of 0.1 C. This unique hybrid HCNT/rGO/S electrode design may motivate the development of other high-performance electrodes with excellent electrochemical properties.

J	Chen, L; Yu, SL; Zhang, YP; Song, YZ; Song, LX				Chen, Le; Yu, Songlin; Zhang, Yaping; Song, Yingze; Song, Lixian			Manipulating electrocatalytic activity of carbon architecture by supercritical carbon dioxide foaming and defect engineering for Li-S chemistry	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Li-S chemistry; Carbon architecture; Activity manipulation; Supercritical carbon dioxide foaming; Defect engineering	SULFUR; CONVERSION; POLYSULFIDES; CHALLENGES; CATALYST	Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have engendered extensive investigation interests owing to their remarkable theoretical capacity and energy density. Nevertheless, LSBs suffer from issues of fatal polysulfide (PS) shuttle and retarded sulfur redox reaction kinetics, impeding their real implementation. In this work, we report a delicate design of melamine formaldehyde resin-derived carbon architecture (CA) with manipulated electrocatalytic activity for Li-S chemistry by synergizing a versatile supercritical carbon dioxide (sc CO2) foaming technique and tailored defect engineering. The superior redox reaction kinetics for PSs afforded by the as-designed active CA resulting from the comprehensive management of hierarchical pore structure, surface area, nitrogen content and vacancy defect degree are demonstrated by our systematic electrochemical measurements and synchrotron X-ray three-dimensional nano-computed tomography (X-ray 3D nano-CT) results. As expected, the cathode shows a low decay of 0.06% per cycle at 1.0 C for 800 cycles. Impressively, even at a high sulfur loading of 9.3 mg cm(-2) and a low electrolyte usage of 4.0 mu L mgS(-1), the cathode still delivers a remarkable specific capacity of 913.9 mA h g(-1) as well as an outstanding retention of 86.3% at 0.1 C after 50 cycles.

The structure and morphology of the as-prepared cathode materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of MCNT content and binder type on the capacity, cyclability and self-discharge behavior of a sulfur-based cathode were systematically investigated. Results show that the appropriate amount of MCNTs is 5%-8% (w, mass fraction) and the use of beta-cyclodextrin as a water-soluble binder to fabricate the cathode results in the best electrochemical performance. When the Li-S battery was half charged at room temperature, there was almost no self-discharge during storage for 30 d. The charging capacity was 687.7 mAh.g(-1) during the 1st cycle and 623.8 mAh.g(-1) during the 100th cycle for the cathode at a current rate of 0.1C. Therefore, 90.7% of the capacity was retained.

Herein, we reported a new method for the fabrication of ultrafine vanadium nitride (VN) nanoparticles uniformly embedded into N-doped porous carbon using a main-chain imidazolium-based ionic polymer (ImIP) containing metavanadate anions as a precursor. ImIP not only serves as sole carbon and nitrogen sources, but also effectively inhibits the aggregation and coalescence of VN nanoparticles during pyrolysis. Benefiting from the ultrafine particle size, high polarity and good electrocatalytic effects of VN, both redox kinetics of sulfur species and chemical adsorbability toward polysulfides are greatly expedited. The resultant electrode exhibits superior cycling stability with a low average capacity decay rate of 0.035% for 1200 cycles at a high rate of 5 C. This work develops a facile ammonia-free approach to fabricate ultrafine VN nanoparticles for improving electrochemical behaviors of Li-S batteries.

The discovery of new host materials is essential, but lengthy and complex experimental studies are inefficient for the identification of potential host materials. We proposed a machine learning method for the rapid discovery of an AB(2)-type sulfur host material to suppress the shuttle effect using the 2DMatPedia database, discovering 14 new structures (PdN2, TaS2, PtN2, TaSe2, AgCl2, NbSe2, TaTe2, AgF2, NiN2, AuS2, TmI2, NbTe2, NiBi2, and AuBr2) from 1320 AB(2)-type compounds. These structures have strong adsorptions of greater than 1.0 eV for lithium polysulfides and appreciable electrontransportation capability, which can serve as the most promising AB 2 -type host materials in lithium-sulfur batteries. On the basis of a small data set, we successfully predicted Li2S6 adsorption at arbitrary sites on substrate materials using transfer learning, with a considerably low mean absolute error (below 0.05 eV). The proposed data-driven method, as accurate as density functional theory calculations, significantly shortens the research cycle of screening AB(2)-type sulfur host materials by approximately 8 years. This method provides high-precision and expeditious solutions for other high-throughput calculations and material screenings based on adsorption energy predictions.

Herein, a freestanding tungsten nitride nanorod/carbon cloth (WN/CC) interlayer is prepared by hydrothermal growth to function as both current collector and physicochemical barrier to soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2Sx). The cells containing a dual-functional interlayer deliver a significantly improved initial discharge capacity of 1337 mAh g(-1) with a reversible capacity of 814.2 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 100 mA g(-1).The enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the highly adsorptive WN nanorods grown on conductive CC to entrap polysulfides, leading to effective recycling of active materials. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove important roles of the WN (200) surface in entrapping polysulfides through their strong adsorption energies (3.21-4.67 eV) with Li2Sx and S-8. The potential of the dual-functional WN/CC composite interlayer in improving the electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries has not been reported previously.

But it has several problems to be solved in order to achieve high sulfur utilization with high Coulombic efficiency and long cycle life of Li-S batteries. These problems are mainly caused by the dissoluble polysulfide species, which are a series of complex reduced sulfur products, associating with shuttle effect between electrodes as well as side reactions on lithium metal anode. To alleviate these challenges, we developed a sulfur-carbon nanotube (S/SWNT) composite coated with polyaniline (PANI) polymer as polysulfide block to achieve high sulfur utilization, high Coulombic efficiency, and long cycle life. The PANI coated S/SWNT composite showed a superior specific capacity of 1011 mAh/g over 100 cycles and a good rate retention, demonstrating the synergic contribution of porous carbon and conducting polymer protection to address challenges underlying sulfur cathode.

This method combines the polarity and porosity advantages of MOFs with the conductive feature of conductive polymers, in this case, polypyrrole (ppy), to construct ppy-MOF compartments for the confinement of sulfur in Li-S batteries. The performances of these ppy-S-in-MOF electrodes exceed those of their MOF and ppy counterparts, especially at high charge-discharge rates. For the first time, the critical role of ion diffusion to the high rate performance was elucidated by comparing ppy-MOF compartments with different pore geometries.

In addition to the traditional cathode based on sulfur composite confined in mesoporous CMK-3 (denoted as S/CMK-3), an additional cathode based on sulfur composite confined in microporous carbon sphere (denoted as S/MiPCS) is set between the S/CMK-3 cathode and separator, which not only functions as a physical barrier to suppress polysulfides immigrating to the lithium anode but also contributes to the overall capacity with a moderate sulfur loading. The double-cathode cell (denoted as DCC) demonstrates a greatly improved cycling stability. After 50 cycles with deep discharge to 1 V at 0.5C, the DCC shows a capacity retention of 70%, whereas the single S/CMK-3 cathode only retains 28%. Even on replacing S/CMK-3 by pure S, the double cathode containing S/MiPCS still exhibits a remarkable improved cyclability. This impressive enhancement mainly benefits from the stable property of MiPCS and its "blocking and reutilization effect". It can be visually confirmed that no polysulfides were generated upon the discharge process when sulfur is confined within the microporous carbon.

Herein, a sandwich structure of bamboo charcoal/sulfur coating by aluminum fluoride (BC@S@AlF3) composites is designed and fabricated for the first time. The as-designed cathode exhibited excellent electrochemical properties and stable capacity retention. The initial capacity reaches 1119 mA h/g and the capacity after 100 cycles is 869 mA h/g at 0.5 C, which is much stable than that of composite materials without bamboo charcoal or AlF3 coating. Moreover, the BC@S@AlF3 cathode presents excellent long-term capacity stability with a capacity decay of 0.073% per cycle during 500 charge/discharge cycles at 1 C, offering a potential for use in high energy Li-S batteries. The physical confinement, chemical anchoring, and catalysis conversion for active sulfur are achieved simultaneously with the AlF3 coating and bamboo charcoal core with porous structure.

Bottom-up, hard template and scalable approaches toward designing nanostructured Li2S for high performance lithium sulfur batteries	NANOSCALE			English	Article							HIGH-CAPACITY; CATHODE MATERIAL; ANODE MATERIALS; GRAPHENE OXIDE; ENERGY-STORAGE; S BATTERIES; CARBON; PARTICLES; NITROGEN; NANOPARTICLES	Li2S with a high theoretical capacity of 1166 mA h g(-1) and the capability to pair with lithium free anodes has drawn much attention for lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery applications. However, the fast battery decay and the low capacity retention due to dissolution of intermediate polysulfides in electrolytes limit its development. Designing a nanosized and nanostructured host for Li2S through facile techniques is one of the ways to alleviate the dissolution and improve Li-S battery performance; nevertheless, it is technically difficult to synthesize nanosized and nanostructured hosts for Li2S because Li2S is highly sensitive to moisture and oxygen. Herein, a novel technique, i.e., a bottom-up, hard template and scalable method, is proposed to engineer nanoLi2S composites with core-shell structures as cathodes of Li-S batteries. The size of the as-prepared nanostructured Li2S is around 100 nm. With the assistance of FETEM, HRTEM and EFTEM elemental mapping, an excellent core-shell structure has been confirmed and the outside carbon shell has a thickness of 20-50 nm, effectively retarding polysulfide outflow and dissolution. A high initial capacity of 915 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C has been achieved upon electrochemical cycling and the battery still has exceptional capacity retention after prolonged 200 cycles with a limited decay of 0.18% per cycle. Also, at 0.5 C the electrode exhibits 60% capacity retention with a long life of 300 cycles. We attribute these good performances to the nano-architecture constructed by the novel and facile method.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have unique advantages as porous sulfur hosts due to their high chemical and structural tunability. Herein, we demonstrate that MOFs consisting of functionalized metal oxide nodes and redox-active linkers influence charge transport and enhance Li-S cycling. We show that anthraquinone-based Zr-MOF composite cathodes display higher maximum capacity and longer cycle life compared to sulfur/carbon electrodes. Lithiating the terminal ligands and bridging hydroxides in the Zr-6(mu(3)-O)(4)(mu(3)-OH)(4) nodes further improves battery performance at high charge rates. We hypothesize that the additional redox sites within the linkers and the presence of lithiated clusters permit greater electrochemical accessibility to the polysulfides by providing additional electron and ion conduction pathways. Moreover, the pore structure plays a critical role in available conduction pathways. Our efforts demonstrate the utility of metal oxide clusters for modulating charge transport and provide structure-function relationships to direct design of novel materials for energy storage devices.

Here, for the first time, well-defined hierarchically porous double-shell hollow polypyrrole@sulfur (h-PPy@S) microspheres were fabricated as sulfur cathodes for high-performance Li-S batteries, with sulfonated polystyrene (PSS) microspheres as sacrificial templates. With an optimized outer sulfur shell, the hierarchically porous h-PPy@S cathode possessed superior electrochemical performance, in comparison with the reported S@PPy cathodes with outer PPy shells, especially the cycling stability. The superior electrochemical performance should have resulted from the unique hierarchically porous double-shell hollow nanostructure with an inner PPy shell and a thinner uniform outer S shell.

However, poor utilization of sulfur and sluggish reaction kinetics leads to unsatisfactory performance of these batteries. Herein, we tune the electrical properties of a carbon cloth derived from waste cotton by suitably selecting the carbonization temperature and utilize it as a current collector in LSB. The fibrous architecture with enhanced electrical conductivity provides efficient channels for electron transport leading to better activation of sulfur. As a result, LSB delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1171 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C rate. Further, LSB cell with addition of a second layer as upper collector between cathode and separator exhibits a high initial capacity of 592 mA h g(-1) at an even faster rate of 1C and retains 81.2% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles with a low capacity fade of 0.033% per cycle. Even with a higher loading of 3.05 mg cm(-2), the LSB maintains a capacity of 423 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 200 cycles with 98% Coulombic efficiency. Moreover, the flexible current collector opens possibilities for development of flexible and wearable energy storage devices. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, polysulfide shuttling, low conductivity of sulfur species and low cell energy densities hinder the practical applications of these batteries. Herein, carbon nanofiber (CNF) is subjected to excimer ultraviolet (EUV) irradiation in ZnCl2 solution affording ZnO grains attached to the CNF (denoted as EUV-ZnO/CNF) as an interlayer for Li-S batteries. EUV-ZnO/CNF shows strong chemical anchoring and physical block effects on the polysulfides as CNF provide a conductive network allowing the fast transmission of electrons, and ZnO particles provide active sites to adsorb the polysulfide intermediate. The electrode with the EUV-ZnO/CNF interlayer exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1388.3 mAh g(-1), and a capacity of 780.4 mAh g(-1) is retained after 200 cycles with S loading of 1.55 mg cm(-2).

Herein, we report a unique hollow pumpkin-like carbon with notable rich-wrinkle microstructure and intrinsically dual doping with N&P elements via a facile annealing process of Aspergillus niger spore. Furthermore, highly conductive polar absorbents, TiC nanoparticles, are in situ implanted into the above Aspergillus niger spore carbon (ANSC) by carbothermal reaction, accordingly forming high-performance ANSC/TiC composite host for sulfur. Impressively, TiC nanoparticles play dual roles of not only pore formation in ANSC matrix but also enhancement of chemical absorption with polysulfides. With the positive synergistic effect between N&P co-doped ANSC matrix and TiC polar absorbent, the designed ANSC/TiC-S cathodes show unique advantages including larger accommodation space for sulfur, higher surface area, enhanced conductivity and better chemical absorption with soluble polysulfide intermediates. Consequently, the ANSC/TiC-S cathodes are endowed with good rate performance (496 mAh/g at 0.5 C) and enhanced long-term cycling stability (736 mAh/g with a capacity retention of 78.8% at 0.1 C after 100 cycles). Our research opens a new door to controllably design advanced composite cathodes from microorganisms for application in lithium sulfur batteries.

Their implementation has been impeded by multiple challenges, especially the dissolution of intermediate lithium polysulfide (Li2Sx) species into the electrolyte. Here, Al2O3 particles decorated polypropylene separator (PP-Al2O3) was investigated. The results show that the thermal stability and the electrolyte wettability of the PP-Al2O3 separator are improved obviously. When the PP-Al2O3 separator is used for Li-S RFB, the cyclic stability and rate capability of the battery are enhanced. The PP-Al2O3 separators are effective in improving the initial discharge capacity of Li-S RFBs from 27.5 to 91.5 mAh g(-1) at 6.25 mA cm(-2). The reason could be ascribed to that the polar Al2O3 coating not only alleviates the shuttle effect by chemical interaction and physical barrier, but also facilitates Li-ion migration by favorable electrolyte wettability. In addition, theoretical calculations reveal that chemical bonds are formed between Al2O3 and Li2Sx. This work provides the rational design strategy for functional separators at cell scale to effective utilizing of active sulfur and retarding of polysulfides, which offers the possibility of high energy density Li-S RFBs with long cycling life.

However, several problems such as low energy density and short cycle life hinder their application in industry. Here, MoS2-MoN heterostructure nanosheets grown on carbon nanotube arrays as free-standing cathodes are reported. In this heterostructure, MoN works as a promoter to provide coupled electrons to accelerate the redox reaction of polysulfides while the MoS2, with a two-dimensional layered structure, provides smooth Li+ diffusion pathways. Through their respective advantages, both MoN and MoS2 could mutually boost the process of "adsorption-diffusion-conversion" of polysulfides, which have a synergy enhancement effect to restrain the lithium polysulfides from shuttling. The designed cathodes show excellent long-term cycling performances of 1000 cycles at 1C with a low decay rate of 0.039% per cycle and a high rate capability up to 6C. A high initial areal capacity of 13.3 mAh cm(-2) is also achieved under a low electrolyte volume/sulfur loading (E/S) ratio of 6.3 mL g(-1). This strategy of promoting polysulfide conversion by heterostructure MoS2-MoN as presented in this work can provide a more structured design strategy for future advanced Li-S energy storage systems.

A sulfur/Ketjenblack (KB) composite was filled and deposited into the aluminum foam current collector via a predetermined filling procedure, resulting in high sulfur loading. The value for this loading was found to be 17.7 mg sulfur/cm(2) by using carboxymethyl cellulose and styrene butadiene rubber (CMC + SBR) as a binder. An operating single-layer pouch-type cell with an S/KB+CMC+SBR on Al foam cathode was created as a result of this synthesis and found to possess an unprecedentedly high areal capacity of 21.9 mAh/cm(2). On the basis of the achieved areal capacity, the energy density of a theoretical lithium-sulfur battery was estimated with the assumption of an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 2.7 mu L/mg. This was calculated upon 100% of the pore volume in the S/KB-CMC + SBR on Al foam cathodes and polyolefin separator, along with the inclusion of the weights of the tabs for the current lead and pouch film packaging in the case of a seven-layer pouch-type battery. With this calculation, it was determined that the creation of a lithium-sulfur battery with an energy density of greater than 200 Wh/kg is plausible. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.

The MoS2 shells consist of MoS2 nanosheets. For comparison, MoS2 IS cathode has also been synthesized through melting and diffusion of sulfur to commercial MoS2 powders. The electrochemical performance of the MoS2@S and MoS2 IS cathodes have been evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, discharge/charge cycling, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy coupled with impedance fitting. The electrochemical performance of the MoS2@S spherical cathode has been much improved compared with that of MoS2/S. The capacity of the MoS2@S spheres can reach 1185.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and 955.1 mAh g(-1) at 1 C with initial-cycle coulombic efficiency of 90%. The capacity fading of each cycle is 0.1% during 200 lithiation/delithiation cycles. The MoS2@S spherical cathode with high cyclic capacity and stability is promising cathode candidate for lithium-sulfur batteries.

Ultrathin double-shell nanotubes of titanium oxide with oxygen-vacancy@nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as OV-TiO2-x@NC) as the sulfur host were designed. As demonstrated by experimental and computational results, an ultrathin TiO(2-x)shell featuring a small aspect ratio can not only provide rapid charge transfer but also shorten the diffusion pathway of lithium ions. Furthermore, the special double-shell nanostructure with the large surface area can accommodate high number of sulfur species, provide effective channels for the electrolyte penetration, supply adequate buffer space for alleviating the volume expansion of sulfur upon repeated cycling, and provide both physical and chemical adsorption to efficiently capture LiPSs. The OV-TiO(2-x)inner shell with a small aspect ratio is compactly packed and tightly adhered to the carbon layer, which can effectively anchor LiPSs with strong chemical affinity and prevent their diffusion from the inner to the outside layer. More importantly, the introduction of oxygen-vacancies can enhance the conductivity of electrode, restrict the loss of LiPSs into the electrolyte, strengthen electrocatalytic activity, and accelerate LiPSs conversion. Endowed with these properties, the OV-TiO2-x@NC/S electrode enables excellent electrochemical performance, including long cycle stability of 531 mA h g(-1)for 3000 cycles at 5C with decay rate of only 0.0123%, excellent rate capability of 675 mA h g(-1)at 8C and high areal capacity of 8.01 mA h cm(-2)with sulfur mass loading of 9.5 mg cm(-2)under low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S = 5). This work provides perspective on altering the electronic states of OV-metal oxides toward high energy density Li-S batteries and promotes the progress of catalysis or energy storage systems.

The cycling performance of the sulfur electrode was characterized in different solvents (triglyme, PEGDME 250 and 500). The variations of capacity and capacity fade rate were also measured as a function of the content of sulfur, carbon and binder. The capacity fade rate of the sulfur electrode was lower with a higher molecular weight solvent such as PEGDME 250 or 500. The content of carbon in the sulfur electrode plays an important role in capacity improvement. The best cell cycled for 600 deep cycles above 100 mAh/g of electrode, and 400 cycles above 160 mAh/g of electrode (80% of original capacity) at room temperature.

Rational design of exfoliated 1T MoS2@CNT-based bifunctional separators for lithium sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							HIGH-ENERGY DENSITY; POROUS CARBON; MOS2; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODE; CATHODES; LAYER; COMPOSITES; NANOSHEETS; NANOTUBES	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are experiencing a design shift from a closed structure to an open structure to further improve their performance, expanding the design realm from the development of nanostructured materials for the cathode to the production of functional separators. Rational guidelines for preparing a bifunctional separator with exfoliated MoS2 and CNTs are suggested to deal with two conflicting issues: guaranteeing the electron pathway while strongly trapping polysulfide species. In addition, various exfoliation methods ranging from mechanical to chemical were investigated to identify an adequate method for preparing exfoliated MoS2 based-bifunctional separators. The electrochemical exfoliation method was found to be effective in not only exfoliating high quality MoS2 in terms of the lateral size and number of layers, but also providing a favorable MoS2 phase, 1T metallic MoS2. A bifunctional separator of 1T exfoliated MoS2@CNT in a tandem configuration (layer-by-layer structure)-coated Celgard rather than a hetero-configuration delivered an excellent electrochemical performance of similar to 670 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at a high current density of 1C. In addition, the separator was highly effective in trapping polysulfide species and facilitating electron transfer to the irreversible discharge products. The rational guidelines suggested in this study will be extended to other two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, and applied to the development of other functional membranes.	[Jeong, Y.

Ball milling and melting method were used to synthesize different S contents (48wt%/62wt%/71wt%) carbon/sulfur composite materials. XRD, FESEM, EDS, and TG were employed to analyze structure and morphology of the samples. The result indicated that element sulfur was uniformly accommodated in the skeletons which were composed by graphene-like layered structure and micrometer sticks. Charge/discharge tests at current density of 0.1C in the voltage range of 1.2-2.8 V showed that the initial discharge specific capacity of the carbon/sulfur composite (62wt%) reached 1246 mAh/g, and its capacity still remained 600 mAh/g even after 100 charge/discharge cycles. The results prove that the obtain composites can suppress the "shuttle effect" of polysulfide species effectively.

Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to construct 3D graphene-based N-doped porous carbon for Li-S batteries. In this strategy, interconnected macropore channels, abundant mesopores and highly accessible micropores are synergistically integrated into a conductive framework constructed by crumpled carbon sheets, and a high content of N-doping (similar to 18 at%) is simultaneously achieved. The obtained porous carbon possesses 3D conductive network, interconnected hierarchical porosities as well as large polarized specific surface, which endow the carbon matrix multifaceted structural merits for electrons/ ions transfer, sulfur accommodation, and polysulfides immobilization. The obtained carbon sulfur composite exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1280 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C, remarkable rate capabilities up to 3C and a prolonged cycling life over 500 cycles at 1C, showing intriguing promise for constructing high energy density Li-S batteries. This strategy provides a new perspective to porosity engineering and surface chemistry modification of carbon-based sulfur hosts and also other electrochemical electrode material.

The pore volume of the GPCs was regulated by adjusting the mass ratio of the silica sol to ice. Lithium polysulfide (LiPS) adsorption experiments show that the materials have a strong chemisorption for LiPSs. Electrochemical measurements show that N-doping accelerates the sulfur reduction kinetics and inhibits the shuttling of LiPSs. In addition, the larger the pore volume of the GPC, the better the cycling stability of the sulfur cathode. A highly N-doped (7.00%) GPC with a pore volume of 2.98 cm(3) g(-1) could adsorb a high sulfur content of 78.4% and had a high sulfur utilization rate. Its composite with sulfur as a cathode material gave a high initial specific capacity of 1384 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, which dropped to 608 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles.

Herein, a rapid gas-engineering technology is developed to fabricate graphene-like mesoporous carbon nanosheets (MCNs) with large aspect ratios (>2500, length/thickness). By easy carbonization of calcium gluconate under reduced pressure, MCNs with ultrathin (similar to 12 nm) thickness, ultralarge (>20 mu m) lamella morphology, and high surface area (similar to 1155 m(2)/g) are fabricated in kilogram scale. Two-dimensional lamella morphology transformation, pore architectures, and calcium compounds transformation mechanisms are unraveled by in situ variable temperature X-ray diffraction (VT-XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The key to the synthesis is the negative pressure operation, which triggers the rapid gas expansion in a gas-solid system. This design relied on the gas expansion mechanism has realized producing of high-quality MCNs via a rapid, high-throughput, and cost-effective way. Due to high surface utilization and low weight density, when served as a lightweight separator coating layer, MCNs exhibit impressive capture ability toward polysulfides and achieve a high-stability lithium-sulfur battery.

This work aims to further develop the coating technology by introducing a unique polymer membrane with rapid gelation function on the top of sulfur cathode. The novel coating strategy combines the advantages of conventional solid coating and gel polymer electrolyte by integrating the two units, allowing for facile ion transport at the interface, flexible surface protection and effective polysulfide immobilization. Also, the catalysis effect and electric activation deriving from the conductive component in the gelled coating, further achieve the redox regulation for sulfur conversion.

Here, we develop a defect engineered MoxW1-xS2-y alloy catalyst (D-MoWS) deposited on carbon nanofiber (CNF) via a facile hydrothermal synthesis followed by a thermal-solvent vapor etching method to expedite the LiPSs redox kinetics and resolve the limit of sulfur utilization in LSB. The LSB cells assembled using the D-MoWS-CNF-S cathode show the highest specific capacity of 1586 mAh g(-1) and excellent areal capacity up to 13.5 mAh cm(-2) at high areal sulfur loading of 10 mg cm(-2), resulting in the highest energy density of 1090 Wh kg(-1) (w.r.t total weight of anode and cathode). Our mechanistic study and ex-situ SEM analysis prove that D-MoWS catalyst accelerates the LiPSs conversion, prevents the shuttling effect and Li-metal corrosion, therefore, effectively reduces the negative/positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio to the lowest reported value of 1.7.

Realizing the accelerated conversion of polysulfides in the cathode host of Li-S batteries is an effective way to improve its coulombic efficiency. The essence of fast conversion relies on enhanced oxidation reaction kinetics by virtue of the metal catalyst, but the generation of various intermediates exacerbate the complexity of the system and perplex the perfect operation of batteries relying on only one catalyst. In this work, the xMoO(2):yCo(2)Mo(3)O(8) heterostructures were designed, in which controlling the content of cobalt could balance the capture capability towards LiPSs by MoO2 and catalytic ability of liquid-solid conversion by Co2Mo3O8 catalytic sites. Therefore, utilizing synergy effect of MoO2-Co2Mo3O8 heterostructure enhances capture and catalytic ability toward polysulfides in Li-S batteries. As a result, the 9MoO(2):2Co(2)Mo(3)O(8)-based cathode delivers excellent reversibility of 880 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2C and 509 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1C with 0.056% capacity decay each cycle.

However, the low electrical conductivity of elemental sulfur, notorious LiPS shuttle and sluggish redox kinetics bring about fast capacity fade and poor rate capabilities. To solve these problems, herein a modification strategy of functional separator is introduced by coating heterostructured MoP-MoS2 and porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) on the surface of a Celgard separator. Moreover, for the first time, we detailly discuss the effect of the ratio of component (MoP:MoS2) in the heterostructured MoP-MoS2 materials on the electrochemical performance. The coating layer exhibits both satisfactory interception ability for LiPS shuttle and fast LiPS conversion ability due to abundant anchoring sites of MoP-MoS2 heterojunction nanoflowers and shortened lithium ion channel of the prepared PCNFs. Benefiting from these advantages, the assembled Li-S battery with a MoP-50/PCNFs separator exhibits 1090.02 mAh g(-1), and high discharge capacity of 884.67 mAh g(-1) even after 300 cycles at 1 C. The initial discharge capacity of MoP-50/PCNFs separator at 2 C and 5 C are about 1050.4 and 728.22 mAh g(-1), and retains about 698.4 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles and 431.28 mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles. The novel work will provide a new strategy by which the modified separator with transition metal phosphides can be applied in the design of high-performance Li-S batteries and shows great potential for practical application.

The PCM possesses micro-, mesoand macropores that provide effective adsorption of polysulfides and accommodation of volume-expanded Li2S as indicated by post-discharge SEM examinations. The embedment of FeP nanoparticles within the PCM ensures maximized exposure of catalytic sites and their improved interactions with sulfur redox species under the confinement effect of carbon nanopores. Compared with Fe3O4, which shows a stronger polysulfide binding strength, FeP offers a balance between effective polysulfide trapping and elevated conversion kinetics for the subsequent liquid-solid transitions. Significantly improved sulfur utilizations and confinement are obtained for Li2S deposition and decomposition, which are regarded as the rateand capacity-limiting steps during charge/ discharge. Detailed working mechanisms are revealed by electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations. PCM/FeP enables outstanding high-rate capability up to 4 degrees C and Li-S pouch cells with high areal (8.6 mAh cm(-2)) and total (414 mAh) capacities are also demonstrated. This study provides new opportunities for the design of high-performance Li-S electrocatalysts.

Although 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as host materials exhibit promising potential for LSBs, their performance is still not satisfactory. Herein, we develop polyimide COFs (PI-COF) with a well-defined lamellar structure, which can be exfoliated into ultrathin (similar to 1.2 nm) 2D polyimide nanosheets (PI-CONs) with a large size (similar to 6 mu m) and large quantity (40 mg/batch). Explored as new sulfur host materials for LSBs, PI-COF and PI-CONs deliver high capacities (1330 and 1205 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C, respectively), excellent rate capabilities (620 and 503 mA h g(-1) at 4 C, respectively), and superior cycling stability (96% capacity retention at 0.2 C for PI-CONs) by virtue of the synergy of robust conjugated porous frameworks and strong oxygen-lithium interactions, surpassing the vast majority of organic/polymeric lithium-sulfur battery cathodes ever reported. Our finding demonstrates that ultrathin 2D COF nanosheets with carbonyl groups could be promising host materials for LSBs with excellent electrochemical performance.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is hindered by the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) shuttle, which induces low sulfur utilization and unsatisfactory capacity retention. To address this problem, recent studies have focused on improving the transformation of LiPS into insoluble Li2S2/Li2S through methods beyond physical or chemical adsorption. Nevertheless, the commonly used host materials have limited ability to simultaneously trap and propel redox transfer of LiPS. Herein, the bottom-up construction of new organic-inorganic hybrid frameworks for sulfur cathodes is proposed to fundamentally restrict LiPS dissolution and enhance their electrochemical transformation. The synergistic integration of organic cellulose networks and inorganic ZIF-derivatives caused highly efficient LiPS mediators to suppress the shuttle effect and retain electrode stability. The resulting RCE-Co3O4@G-S cathode materials delivered a stable capacity of 726.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 350 cycles, with a very low fading rate of 0.026% per cycle and a high coulombic efficiency of 98.9%.

Gum arabic (GA), a low cost, nontoxic, and sustainable natural polymer from Acacia senegal, is adopted as a binder for the sulfur cathode to address these issues. The excellent mechanical properties of GA endow the cathode with high binding strength and suitable ductility to buffer volume change, while the functional groups chemically and physically confine sulfur species within the cathode to inhibit the shuttling effect of polysulfides. Additionally, GA shifts the electrode fabrication process from the organic solvent process to an aqueous process, eliminates the use of toxic organic solvents, and achieves uniformly distributed electrode with lower impedance. A remarkable cycling performance, i.e., 841 mAh g(-1) at low current rate of C/5, is achieved throughout 500 cycles due to the bifunctions of the GA binder.

Here, highquality crumpled graphene microflower (GmF) for high-performance electrodes is designed. The GmF possesses four advantages simultaneously: highly crystallized defect-free graphene layers, low stacking degree, sub-millimeter continuous surface, and large productivity with low cost. When utilized as carbon host for sulfur cathode, the GmF-sulfur hybrid delivers decent areal capacities of 5.2 mAh cm(-2) at 0.1 C and 3.8 mAh cm(-2) at 0.5 C. When utilized as cathode of Al-ion battery, the GmF affords a high capacity of 100 mAh g(-1) with 100% capacity retention after 5000 cycles and excellent rate capability from 0.1 to 20 A g(-1).

Herein, sulfur is copolymerized with poly(m-aminothiophenol) (PMAT) nanoplates through inverse vulcanization to form the highly crosslinked copolymer cp(S-PMAT) in which approximately 80wt% of the feed sulfur is bonded chemically to the thiol groups of PMAT. A cp(S-PMAT)/C-based cathode exhibits a high discharge capacity of 1240mAhg(-1) at 0.1C and remarkable rate capacities of 880mAhg(-1) at 1C and 600mAhg(-1) at 5C. Moreover, it can retain a capacity of 495mAhg(-1) after 1000 deep discharge-charge cycles at 2C; this corresponds to a retention of 66.9% and a decay rate of only 0.040% per cycle. Such a remarkable rate performance is attributed to the highly conductive pathways of PMAT nanoplates, and the excellent cycling stability is ascribed mainly to the chemical confinement of sulfur through a large number of stable covalent bonds between sulfur and the thiol groups of PMAT. The results suggest that this strategy is a viable paradigm for the design and engineering of conducting polymers with reactive functional groups as effective electrode materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The as-prepared materials with spherical structure show excellent sulfur loading of 72.6 wt% and specific surface area of 2064.5 m(2) g(-1). The active material as cathode for lithium sulfur battery can effectively suppress shuttle effect and display remarkable electrochemical performance due to the modification of tetra-nuclear silver metal organic knots and polyethylene glycol for CA, the special modifiers provide more nanochannels for CA to significantly restrict the loss of sulfur. The prominent performance mainly benefits from the synergistic effect of interconnected nanochannel network structure and transition metal sulfide (Ag2S) and nitrogen doping. Especially, the PEG-Ag-CA material delivers discharge capacity of 1313.6 mAh g(-1) at a rate of 0.2C in first cycle, and retains 1143.8 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles. In addition, the theoretical calculations by density functional theory (DFT) further confirm the excellent absorption ability between prepared material and lithium polysulfide, and fully prove the absorption mechanism.

As for cathode's performance, the main challenges for developing highly-efficient and long-life Li-S batteries are to retard the polysulfides diffusion into electrolyte and the reaction with metallic lithium (Li). Especially, the safety issues, derived from metallic Li in anode, must be overcome. Herein, we fabricated lithium sulfide@porous carbon composites (Li2S@PC) by an in-situ reaction between the lithium sulfate (Li2SO4) and the pyrolytic carbon from glucose. The nanosized Li2S particles were uniformly distributed in the carbon matrix, which not only significantly improve electronic conductivity of the electrode but also effectively trap the dissolved polysulfides. Furthermore, on the basis of the graphite's electrochemical features in ether-based electrolyte, we assembled graphite-Li2S@PC full cells using the obtained Li2S@PC composites as the cathode, graphite as the anode and the DOL/DME with LiNO3 additive as the electrolyte. A unique strategy was proposed to activate the full-cells in descending order using constant voltage and current to charge the cut-off voltage. This Li-S full cell exhibits stable cycling performance at 0.5 C over 100 cycles. Because graphite-Li2S batteries are suitable to the lithium-ion batteries industry, our preliminary results here will shed a new light on the cell design and industrial production.

Presently, however, the superior energy performance fades rapidly when the sulfur electrode is loaded to the required levels-5 to 10 mg cm(-2)-due to substantial volume change of lithiation/delithiation and the resultant stresses. Inspired by the classical approaches in particle agglomeration theories, we found an approach that places minimum amounts of a high-modulus binder between neighboring particles, leaving increased space for material expansion and ion diffusion. These expansion-tolerant electrodes with loadings up to 15 mg cm(-2) yield high gravimetric (>1200 mA.hour g(-1)) and areal (19 mA.hour cm(-2)) capacities. The cells are stable for more than 200 cycles, unprecedented in such thick cathodes, with Coulombic efficiency above 99%.	[Shaibani, Mahdokht; Mirshekarloo, Meysam Sharifzadeh; Cooray, M. C.

Herein, an in situ formed sulfiphilic superfine Fe2O3 nanocrystals confined in lithiophilic N-doped microporous carbon (Fe2O3/N-MC) is derived from one-step hypercrosslinked polymerization. Uniquely, the dual active sites (Fe2O3 and N) in Fe2O3/N-MC tend to form "Fe-S, Li-O or Li-N" bonding, and then synchronically enhancing the chemisorption and interface conversion ability of Li polysulfides. As a result, 80 wt% S is loaded on Fe2O3/N-MC and the hybrid cathode delivers high mass capacity (730 mA h g(-1)) and excellent cycling stability (87.1% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 5.0 C). Especially, the cathode also exhibits a high reversible areal capacity of 3.69 mA h cm(-2) at a high areal loading (5.1 mg cm(-2)) and a lean electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio (7.5 mu L mg(-1)) over 500 cycles. This work is anticipated to deepen the comprehension of complex Li polysulfides interphase conversion processes and afford new thoughts for designing new host materials.

Composite electrodes based on carbon microstructures are often used as a host for sulfur. However, sulfur lixiviation, insoluble species formation, and how to maximize the sulfur-carbon contact in looking for improved electrochemical performance are still major challenges. In this study, a nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon is used as a host for sulfur. The S/C composite electrodes are prepared by sulfur melting-diffusion process at 155 degrees C. The effect of the sulfur melting-diffusion time [sulfur infiltration time] (1-24 h) and sulfur content (10-70%) is investigated by using XRD, SEM, TEM and TGA analyses and correlated with the electrochemical performance in Li-S cells. S/C composite electrode with homogeneous sulfur distribution can be reached with 6 h of sulfur melting-diffusion and 10 wt.% of sulfur content. Li-S cell with this composite shows a high use of sulfur and sufficient electronic conductivity achieving an initial discharge capacity of 983 mA h g(-1) and Coulombic efficiency of 99% after 100 cycles.

However, the dissolution and shuttling of the intermediate polysulfides (PS) initiates the loss of active sulfur and the poisoning of the lithium anode, leading to unsatisfactory cyclability and consequently hinders the commercialization of Li-S batteries. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to tame the PS dissolution and the shuttling effect in the Li-S system by introducing a modified polybenzimidazole (mPBI) with multiple functions. As a binder, the excellent mechanical property of mPBI endows the sulfur electrode with strong integrity and, therefore, results in high sulfur loading (7.2 mg cm(-2)), whereas the abundant chemical interaction between mPBI and PS affords efficient PS adsorption to inhibit sulfur loss and prolong battery life. As a functional agent for the separator, the mPBI builds a PS shield onto the separator to block PS's migration to further suppress the PS shuttling. The dual actions of mPBI confer an excellent performance of 750 mAh g(-1) (or 5.2 mAh cm(-2)) after 500 cycles at C/5 on the Li-S battery with an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.08% per cycle.

Their exact lithiation/ delitiation mechanism is not clear and how to select proper electrolytes for the S2-4 cathodes is also ambiguous. Here, S2-4 and S-8/S2-4 composites with highly ordered microporous carbon as a confining matrix are fabricated and the electrode mechanism of the S2-4 cathode is investigated by comparing the electrochemical performances of the S2-4 and S2-4/S-8 electrodes in various electrolytes combined with theoretical calculation. Experimental results show that the electrolyte and microstructure of carbon matrix play important roles in the electrochemical performance. If the micropores of carbon are small enough to prevent the penetration of the solvent molecules, the lithiation/ delithiation for S2-4 occurs as a solid-solid process. The irreversible chemically reactions between the polysulfudes and carbonates, and the dissolution of the poly-sulfides into the ethers can be effectively avoided due to the steric hindrance. The confined S2-4 show high adaptability to the electrolytes. The sulfur cathode based on this strategy exhibits excellent rate capability and cycling stability.

We develop in this work a powerful functional separator to suppress the polysulfide shuttle by coating two-dimensional nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets on one surface of a commercial polypropylene separator. The high surface area, high content of nitrogen dopants, and close-packing laminar structure of the two-dimensional porous carbon nanosheets make them ideal to fabricate a lightweight and thin separator for high-energy-density Li-S batteries. The separator reported in this work endows the high-sulfur-loading cathodes made of commercial carbon materials with significantly enhanced performances that are comparable with or even superior to the state-of-the-art sulfur composite cathodes, opening up new opportunities for designing practical high-energy-density Li-S batteries.

The highly conductive and porous NCNF matrix provides numerous conductive channels for rapid ionic and electronic transfer. HNC guarantees efficient impregnation of a large volume of active material along with high loading, channelizing the volume variation stress, and ensuring efficient electrolyte percolation, which is crucial for uniform dispersion and high active sulfur utilization, especially at low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios. The metallic-Ni/Co and polar spineltype NiCo2O4 nanoparticles offer sufficient chemisorption sites to prevent polysulfide migration towards the anode. Li-S cells assembled using P-N-CNF@NCO/HNC as an advanced host and lithium polysulfide catholyte as the starting material displayed stable electrochemical performance even with strident battery parameters, including high sulfur content (79.8 wt%), high sulfur loading (7.7 mg cm-2), and low E/S ratio (8.0 mu L mg-1). The cell displays a maximum areal capacity of 5.4 mA h cm-2 that stabilizes to 2.8 mA h cm-2 after 160 cycles at 0.1 C and is comparable to the theoretical threshold of presently available commercial systems.

Herein, light-weight g-C3N4/carbon hybrid cages as sulfur host have been designed and fabricated using NaCl and nanosized manganese compounds (MnO and MnCN2) as templates via a facile and controllable aerosol-pyrolysis route. The porous g-C3N4/carbon shell is designed to facilitate fast electron/Li ion transports and impede lithium polysulfide shuttle simultaneously. The cage cavity created by the NaCl template is designed to enhance sulfur loading content. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate excellent cyclic capacity and stability of core-shell structured S@g-C3N4/carbon cathode endowed by the versatile structural and chemical advantages of the g-C3N4/carbon host cages. The first-cycle discharge capacities reach 1517 and 1240 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C and 1 C, respectively, demonstrating efficient utilization of the loaded sulfur. The capacity fading rate of each cycle is 0.09% during 400 discharge/charge cycles (from the second cycle) at 1 C. These light-weight, conductive and polar g-C3N4/carbon cages have been demonstrated to be suitable hosts to load sulfur as high-performance cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, the practical application of Li-S batteries is still limited by the cycle stability and rate capability, which is highly relied on the well-designed cathode material. Inspired by the unique structure of frogspawn in Nature, a hollow Fe3C@N-C with frogspawn-like architecture was successfully constructed as a highly efficient sulfur host in this paper. Derived from a Prussian blue self-template, Fe3C@N-C possesses a metal-like Fe3C spawn core and the high conductivity of an N-doped carbon shell. This unique structure enables a large surface area, fast e(-)/Li+ transport, as well as a large hollow space for the volumetric expansion of the sulfur cathode. Moreover, with the N-doped carbon shell and the polar Fe3C core, the trapping and catalytic conversion of intermediate polysulfides are also facilitated. The strongly coupled interaction of polar Fe3C and polysulfides is confirmed by both theoretical calculations and electrochemical performance. Specifically, the Fe3C@N-C/S electrode presents a high capacity of 1351 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C with the Fe3C@N-C as an integrated sulfur host. In particular, the rate capability and cycling stability of the Fe3C@N-C/S electrode is outstanding. It displays a high capacity of 792 mA h g(-1) at 5C and a low capacity decay rate of 0.08% per cycle at 0.5C after 400 cycles. This work opens a convenient and economical avenue to design a frogspawn-like hollow metal carbide/carbon as an efficient sulfur host for advanced Li-S batteries.

Herein, N-doped carbon nanocages decorated with homogeneously dispersed TiN nanoparticles (TiN@C NCs) as multifunctional sulfur hosts are designed for superior LSBs. Carbon nanocages provide space to mitigate volume expansion and provide additional physical adsorption to trap the LiPSs. Polar TiN nanoparticles not only exhibit the chemisorption capacity for LiPSs, but also catalyze and promote the conversion of long-chain LiPSs to Li2S2/Li2S in the reduction process as well as the decomposition of Li2S in the oxidation reaction, which significantly boosts electron/ion transport and decreases the potential barrier. Therefore, the S/TiN@C NC cathode has an excellent electrochemical capacity of 1485.7 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C. In particular, the cathode demonstrates high capacity reversibility after 500 cycles at 3 C with a retention of about 73.1%, which is equivalent to a slow capacity decay rate of 0.053% per cycle.

Beyond its interesting intrinsic properties, sulfur possesses a very low conductivity and complex electrochemistry, which involves the high solubility of the lithium sulfides in the electrolyte. These two characteristics are at the core of a series of limitations of its performance as active cathode material, which leads to batteries with low cyclability. Recently, inverse vulcanized sulfur was shown to retain capacity far better than elemental sulfur, leading to batteries with excellent cyclability. Nevertheless, the diene co-monomers used so far in the inverse vulcanization process are man-made molecules. Herein, a tentative work on exploring inverse vulcaniza-tion using two naturally available monomers, diallyl sulfide and myrcene, is presented. The inverse vulcanization of sulfur was successfully completed, and the resulting polymers were characterized by FTIR, NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis. Afterwards these polymers were tested as cathodic materials in lithium-sulfur cells. The sulfur-natural dienes materials exhibited high capacity at different C rates and high lifetime over 200 cycles with very high capacity retention at a moderate C rate of C/5. Altogether, these materials made from inexpensive and abundant chemicals are an excellent option as sustainable materials for electrochemical energy storage.

At this relatively high sulfur loading, we evaluated the impact of binder and carbon type on the mechanical integrity and the electrochemical properties of sulfur electrodes. We identified hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) as a new binder for the sulfur electrode because it offers better adhesion between the electrode and the aluminum current collector than the commonly used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. In combination with the binder study, multiple types of carbon with high specific surface area were evaluated as sulfur hosts for high loading sulfur electrodes. A commercial microporous carbon derived from wood with high pore volume showed the best performance. An electrode with sulfur loading up to 10 mg cm(-2) was achieved with the optimized recipe. Based on systematic electrochemical studies, the soluble polysulfide to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S conversion was identified to be the major barrier for high loading sulfur electrodes to achieve high sulfur utilization.

Here we report a strategy to entrap polysulfides and boost the cathodic redox kinetics by embedding the surface oxidized quantum-dot-size TiN (TiN-O) within the highly ordered mesoporous carbon matrix. While the carbon scaffold offers sufficient electrical contact to the insulate sulfur, benefiting the full usage of sulfur and physical confinement of polysulfides. The surface oxygen renders TiN-O with a strong charge polarization effect for polysulfides via S-O-Ti bond as verified experimentally and theoretically. The suppressed shuttle effect and high lithium ion diffusion coefficient (7.9 x 10(-8) cm(2) s(-1)) lead to a high capacity of 1264 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C with a negligible capacity fading rate of 0.06% per cycle. Additionally, TiN-O based prototype soft-package cells also exhibit excellent cycling stability with flexibility, demonstrating their potential for practical applications.

Herein, the shuttle effect of polysulfides was efficiently inhibited by using a lightweight and thin functional separator in the form of coating three-dimensional interconnected nitrogen-doped graphene-like porous carbon nanosheets on one surface of a commercial polypropylene separator. This structure for a thin functional separator heightens the reversible capacity and cycle performance by doping nitrogen to chemically bond with polysulfides and the porous carbon layer to physically block polysulfides. As a result, the Li-S batteries based on the functional separators deliver an initial capacity of 1169.0 mA h g(-1)at current rate of 1C and a substantial capacity of 845.3 mA h g(-1)after 500 cycles, corresponding to a low capacity decay of only 0.055% per cycle. Even at a high rate of 3C, the batteries can still deliver a high reversible capacity of 743.6 mA h g(-1)with good cycle performance.

Herein, hierarchical hollow carbon microtubes (CMTs) are simply prepared by carbonization of willow catkins and coated on a commercialized separator for high-performance LSBs. The CMTs-coated separator can inhibit the diffusion of polysulfides through physical and chemical adsorption, which alleviates the shuttle effect effectively. In addition, the CMTs interlayer acts as an upper current collector to provide continuous highways for electron and ion transport to enhance the utilization of active materials. As a result, the cells with a CMTs-coated separator exhibit a high discharge specific capacity of 800 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1), which is higher than the capacity (554 mAh g(-1)) of the cell with the pristine separator. This work not only provides a green process to produce sustainable and low-cost hollow CMTs but also designs high-performance LSBs based on the obtained CMTs.

However, the practical applications of Li-S batteries are still intercepted by the notorious shuttle effect and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, a porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanorod embedded with ultrafine Bi nanoparticles (Bi-NC) is constructed to function as an advanced sulfur host. The existence of Bi nanoparticles induces the local charge rearrangement and hence optimizes the electronic structure of Bi-NC. As a result, Bi-NC significantly features the effective chemical adsorption and remarkable redox catalyzation for polysulfides, corroborated by both computational and experimental demonstrations. Profiting from these distinctive superiorities, the enhanced utilization of sulfur species and facilitated redox kinetics of polysulfides are achieved. Therefore, the Bi-NC/S electrode delivers a high initial capacity of 1157 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C, a superb capacity retention of 811 mA h g(-1) at 1C after 500 cycles, and an excellent areal capacity of 6.48 mA h cm(-2) even under a high-sulfur loading of 7.0 mg cm(-2). This work affords an innovational regulation of electronic structures via the local charge rearrangement for developing ideal hosts towards the practical high-performance Li-S batteries.

In this study, we demonstrated a facile strategy for the fabrication of an integrated lithium sulfide (Li2S) cathode by incorporating lithium sulfide (Li2S)/carbon black (CB) into the carbon felt (CF) with a 3D conductive network and further modifying it by an outer amorphous carbon shell (CF-CB-Li2S@C) via facile liquid solution-evaporation plus chemical vapor deposition technologies. The CF with abundant macroporous channels provides enough reaction sites to load and stabilize a high amount of active materials. The inter-connected conductive network and efficient carbon shell not only provide efficient electron transport and guarantee high active material utilization, but also form a durable protective shield for suppressing polysulfide dissolution. As a result, the CF-CB-Li2S@C cathode with a high loading of 7 mg cm(-2) demonstrates an initial discharge capacity of 943.7 mA h g(-1) (6.60 mA h cm(-2)) at 0.1C. Importantly, it still maintains a capacity of 567.5 mA h g(-1) (3.97 mA h cm(-2)) at 1C after 200 cycles, corresponding to a low fading rate of 0.12% per cycle.

However, the practical applications are hampered by capacity decay, mainly attributed to the polysulfide shuttle. Here, the authors have fabricated a solid core-shell gamma-MnO2-coated sulfur nanocomposite through the redox reaction between KMnO4 and MnSO4. The multifunctional MnO2 shell facilitates electron and Li+ transport as well as efficiently prevents polysulfide dissolution via physical confinement and chemical interaction. Moreover, the gamma-MnO2 crystallographic form also provides one-dimensional (1D) tunnels for the Li+ incorporation to alleviate insoluble Li2S2/Li2S deposition at high discharge rate. More importantly, the MnO2 phase transformation to Mn3O4 occurs during the redox reaction between polysulfides and gamma-MnO2 is first thoroughly investigated. The S@ gamma-MnO2 composite exhibits a good capacity retention of 82% after 300 cycles (0.5 degrees C) and a fade rate of 0.07% per cycle over 600 cycles (1 degrees C). The degradation mechanism can probably be elucidated that the decomposition of the surface Mn3O4 phase is the cause of polysulfide dissolution. The recent work thus sheds new light on the hitherto unknown surface interaction mechanism and the degradation mechanism of Li-S cells.

Surface modification is generally used to improve the electrochemical performance of CNF cloth/S cathodes. However, this strategy creates some problems such as structure collapse, complex fabrication steps, and poor consistency. Herein, a beta-MnO2 nanowire/graphene-modified separator is used to improve the performance of CNF cloth/S cathodes without changing their structure. beta-MnO2 can facilitate chemical bonding with polysulfides, whereas graphene can decrease the inner resistance and trap polysulfide by physical shielding. The cathode with the bifunctional separator displayed a high discharge capacity of 529.9 mAh g(-1) with a low capacity decay of 0.051 % per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C, which is 3 times higher compared with a bare separator. Even with a high sulfur loading of 9.0 mg cm(-2), a high areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm(-2) was delivered over 100 cycles.

Here, the authors report an in-situ restructured artificial lithium/electrolyte SEI exposing an ultrasmooth and thin layer mediated through graphene quantum dots (GQDs). The reformed artificial interphase comprises a mixture of organic/inorganic-rich compositions alike as mosaic interphase, albeit the synergistic effect mediated via hydroxylated GQDs involving redeposition-borne lithium, and its accumulated salts, facilitate a homogeneous and ultrasmooth near fluorine-rich interfacial environment ensuring a facile lithium-ion (Li-ion) diffusion and dendritic-free nature. As a result, symmetrical graphene dots-lithium cells enable a dendrite-less operation up to 2000 h with good cycling stability and capacity retention at current densities 1 and 5 mA cm(-2) compared to bare lithium. The well-established fluorinated interface engenders a high reversible capacity and stable performance during the initial and long-term cycles upon configuring in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) cells. Thus, the authors' work illuminates the direction toward achieving dendritic-free smooth and robust metal anodes through manipulating and restructuring the critical SEI chemical components.

J	Yu, XW; Manthiram, A				Yu, Xingwen; Manthiram, Arumugam			A class of polysulfide catholytes for lithium-sulfur batteries: energy density, cyclability, and voltage enhancement	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							IONIC LIQUID ELECTROLYTE; ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION; RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES; FUNDAMENTAL CHEMISTRY; APROTIC-SOLVENTS; ELEMENTAL SULFUR; DIMETHYLFORMAMIDE; CATHODE; UV/VIS; S-8	Liquid-phase polysulfide catholytes are attracting much attention in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries as they provide a facile dispersion and homogeneous distribution of the sulfur active material in the conductive matrix. However, the organic solvents used in lithium-polysulfide (Li-PS) batteries play an important role and have an impact on the physico-chemical characteristics of polysulfides. For instance, significantly higher voltages (similar to 2.7 V) of the S/S-n(2-) (4 <= n <= 8) redox couple are observed in Li-PS batteries with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents. Accordingly, high power Li-PS batteries are presented here with the catholyte prepared with NMP solvent and operated with the highly reversible sulfur/long-chain polysulfide redox couple. On the other hand, a remarkable cyclability enhancement of the Li-PS battery is observed with the long-chain, ether-based tetraglyme (TEGDME) solvent. The voltage enhancement and the cyclability enhancement of the Li-PS batteries are attributed to the solvation effect, viscosity, and volatility of the solvents. Finally, highly concentrated polysulfide catholytes are successfully synthesized, with which high energy density Li-PS batteries are demonstrated by employing a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) fabric electrode.

The CNT network acts as a skeleton to form a self-sustained cathode that is binder-free, highly conductive, and flexible. Graphene with a 2D sheet structure extends in an additional dimension to provide improved restriction for sulfur/polysulfides. Moreover, the CNT/G hybrid framework enables better dispersion of sulfur and allows each sulfur particle to closely attach to the conductive components, which greatly enhance the electronic conductivity and thereby approach the full potential of the active materials. With an optimized CNT/G ratio in the framework, the S-CNT/G nanocomposite exerts improved mechanical performance and favorable electrochemical characteristics compared to the S-CNT composite. Based on its superior structure, the S-CNT/G nanocomposite achieves a high discharge capacity of 1048 mA h g(-1) at 1 C with a capacity fade as low as 0.041% per cycle over 1000 charge-discharge cycles. Excellent high-rate and long-term cycling performances are also revealed. These results demonstrate the great potential of the S-CNT/G nanocomposite as a flexible and binder-free cathode for Li-S batteries.

Besides, the high gravimetric energy density makes Li-S batteries more suitable as power sources for apparatuses such as high-altitude drones and space vehicles. For these applications, the batteries should have a low self-discharge and a wide temperature range. Herein, we introduce carbon nanofibers with MnS sulfiphilic sites as flexible interlayers into Li-S batteries, reducing the shuttle effect and accelerating the reaction kinetics through physical inhibition, chemical adsorption and conversion that promote synergy. The self-discharge of the cell is significantly weakened. The voltage is maintained at 2.37 V during 150 hours resting after 20 cycles. For a sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2), the capacity is as high as 714 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 1C at room temperature. Besides, the operating temperature of the cell is broadened. At 55 degrees C and 0 degrees C, the capacity can be stabilized at 894 mA h g(-1) and 853 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5C, respectively. This work can gain wide research interest toward lithium-sulfur batteries for applications in extreme environments.

Sulfonic Acid Based Complex Framework Materials (CFM): Nanostructured Polysulfide Immobilization Systems for Rechargeable Lithium-Sulfur Battery	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORK; MESOPOROUS CARBON; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; POROUS CARBON; PHOSPHO-OLIVINES; PORE BLOCKAGE; SURFACE; PHOTOELECTRON; ELECTROLYTE; CHALLENGES	Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) secondary batteries with sulfur cathodes and theoretical energy density of similar to 2600 Wh/kg, are promising high energy-density system for next-generation electric-vehicles (EVs) potentially mitigating the gravimetric and volumetric energy density limitations of existing lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. Herein, a chemically synthesized sulfonic acid-based complex framework material (CFM) termed as (SCFM), was used as sulfur host (S-SCFM) to prevent polysulfide dissolution in Li-S batteries. The SSCFM based CFM cathodes show an initial capacity of 1190 mAh/g and a capacity of 1044 mAh/g after 100 cycles. In addition, the S-SCFM based CFM cathodes exhibited good cycling stability with a minimal fade rate of similar to 0.0012% per cycle. XPS analysis of the cycled separators with the S-SCFM electrodes shows complete absence of polysulfide species after 100 charge-discharge cycles. It was also identified that the SCFM based CFM chemically binds sulfur via - C-S-linkages thereby exhibiting an affinity for the polysulfide species formed during the charge-discharge cycles. As a result, the SCFM based CFM prevent polysulfide species from dissolving and diffusing into the electrolyte. A thorough understanding of these engineered SCFM based CFM sulfur host in Li-S battery outlined herein will be vital in designing promising sulfur hosts for next generation sulfur cathodes in Li-S batteries.

J	Guo, JL; Zhang, XL; Du, XY; Zhang, FX				Guo, Junling; Zhang, Xiaolong; Du, Xinyu; Zhang, Fengxiang			A Mn3O4 nano-wall array based binder-free cathode for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							CARBON POLYHEDRA; HOLLOW SPHERES; ION BATTERIES; HIGH-CAPACITY; HIGH-ENERGY; GRAPHENE; ELECTRODE; CLOTH; HOST; POLYSULFIDES	Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have recently attracted great interest owing to their high theoretical energy density (2500 kW kg(-1)) and low cost and the environmental friendliness of sulfur as the active species at the cathode. However, rapid capacity fading restricts practical application of LSBs. Despite the encouraging progress achieved, this issue still needs to be further addressed. Herein, we report a novel cathode structure based on nano-wall-array Mn3O4 which shows excellent cycle and rate performances. In such a cathode, the Mn3O4 nano-wall arrays function as "nano reservoirs" for sulfur confinement so that the cathode can yield a high-rate (2C) initial (similar to 593 mA h g(-1)) and reversible capacity (similar to 355 mA h g(-1), 60% retention after 3000 cycles). We also show, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses, that Mn3O4 as a sulfur-hosting oxide is better than conventionally used MnO2; this is because the former shows better chemical stability in the electrolyte when binding with polysulfides, giving rise to long-lasting suppression of polysulfide shuttle. Our work demonstrates that building a nano-wall array structure of Mn3O4 is an effective strategy to improve lithium-sulfur cathode performance, and for the first time, we propose and show that the stability of polar materials in the electrolyte is a crucial factor that determines the cycle performance of polar materials/ S electrodes.

With the aim to unveil the effect of these features on the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode, these samples are evaluated as sulfur host and comprehensively investigated. NC-800 (800 degrees C, 10.45%N, 1032.4 m(2) g(-1)) exhibits the best electrochemical capability comparing with NC-700 (700 degrees C, 16.59%N, 891.4 m(2) g(-1)) and NC-900 (900 degrees C, 7.59%N, 987.6 m(2) g(-1)). High surface area and N-doping can work together to well increase the capacity of sulfur cathode, thanks to the improved transportation of charge carriers and effective anchoring of active sulfur, while the latter specialty just makes sulfur cathode have decent capacity in case of low surface area. Graphitization and quaternary nitrogen favorably improve the electric conductivity of the electrode, empowering the improvement of discharge capacity initially and rendering the good cyclability cooperatively relying on the effective immobilization of active materials. The related results suggest the significance of rational design of carbon maxtrix for sulfur to improve the performance of Li-S batteries.

Here we disclose that extremely low polyaniline loading can realize excellent cell performance, where conductive polyaniline is uniformly produced on the surface of sulfur-wrapped carbon nanoparticles via dilute aniline polymerization. Even ca. 1 wt% of polyaniline loading is enough to suppress diffusion and dissolution of polysulfides, and the sluggish charge transfer is accelerated. In addition to enhanced cycle stability, a remarkable increase in capacity by ca. 46% is realized compared to sulfur-wrapped carbon composite after 100th at 0.5 C. Moreover, an electrochemical property with coulombic efficiency above 95% and a high capacity retention rate of 55% is achieved even after 500 cycles at ca. 2 wt% polyaniline loading.

In this work, a multifunctional separator with gradual changes to four aspects was constructed by integrating a PVDF-HFP/h-BN membrane with a Co-doped carbon nanofiber. The architecture has four gradations, which offers multifold advantages. First, in terms of density, there is a transition from loose to dense, which results in a higher electrolyte uptake rate, reduces the amount of free electrolyte and further suppresses the shuttle effect. Additionally, in terms of composition, a transition from inorganic to organic is designed, which allows the inorganic and organic components to bind closely and reduces the interfacial resistance. Meanwhile, there is a transition from high electronic conductivity to insulation. The change in electronic conductivity leads to effective conversion of the polysulfide. Finally, in terms of ionic conductivity, there is a transition from low to high, which gives the separator better ability to conduct lithium ions. As a consequence, a battery with the as-constructed multifunctional separator performs with good capacity stability, which demonstrates a new concept for high-performance lithium-sulfur battery design.

Herein, a heterostructural Fe3C/Fe@NC/G nanocomposite, in which the Fe3C and Fe nanoparticles are well-embedded in the N-doped porous carbon nanosheets and graphene substrate, is firstly prepared by a novel two-steps temperaturecontrolled calcination, and then it is used to modify the conventional PP separator. The thin Fe3C/Fe@NC/G coating layer can not only effectively block the diffusion of dissolved polysulfides through the physical barrier and chemical binding, but also accelerates the redox conversion of polysulfides as a functional catalyst. As a result, a Li-S cell prepared by this modified separator and a S/KB composite with a high sulfur content of 70 wt% in the final cathode displays high discharge capacity and good cycling capability, with a high specific capacity of - 1489 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and a capacity decline rate of - 0.062% per cycle during 500 cycles at 1.0C, respectively. Furthermore, this functional separator can enable a Li-S cell with a high sulfur areal loading of 5.0 mg cm-2 to perform well, with a high specific capacity of 618 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and a good cycling stability. This facile and effective strategy will provide better insight to develop high-energy Li-S batteries, from the perspective of improvement of kinetics conversion and decrease of shuttle effect of the polysulfides simultaneously.

The nano-confined LiBH4 has fast ionic lithium conductivity at room temperature, 0.1 mScm(-1), negligible electronic conductivity and its cationic transport number (t(+) = 0.96), close to unity, demonstrates a purely cationic conductor. The electrolyte has an excellent stability against lithium metal. The behavior of the batteries is studied by cyclic voltammetry and repeated charge/discharge cycles in galvanostatic conditions. The batteries show very good performance, delivering high capacities versus sulfur mass, typically 1220 mAhg(-1) after 40 cycles at moderate temperature (55 degrees C), 0.03 C rates and working voltage of 2 V.

Herein, low-cost and carbon/nitrogen-rich waste honeycombs are used to prepare in situ N-doped hierarchical porous carbon (INHPC) and firstly applied as a sulfur host by facile high-temperature carbonization combined with KHCO3 activation. The influence of mass ratios of the activator to honeycomb on the morphology and pore structure of the as-prepared carbon materials was investigated in detail. Among them, the optimized INHPC with a mass ratio of 4 : 1 presents block-like morphology with interconnected pore structure, while showing a high specific surface area of 1683.6 m(2) g(-1) and a large pore volume of 0.974 cm(3) g(-1). Moreover, the in situ N-doped carbon materials not only have good electronic conductivity but also strong chemical adsorption with polysulfide intermediates, hence effectively alleviating the shuttle effect. When used as the sulfur host, the as-obtained INHPC-4/S composite cathode with a sulfur content of 60 wt% delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 913.4 mA h g(-1) and retains a reversible capacity of 538.3 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Even at a current rate of 1 C, the first discharge capacity of 623.2 mA h g(-1) can be obtained, simultaneously achieving the durable cycle life up to 500 cycles. These good electrochemical performances are ascribed to physicochemical synergistic adsorption of in situ N-doping and hierarchical porous structure as well as high ionic/electronic conductivity.

However, the shuttle effect results from a sluggish conversion reaction of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), reduces the sulfur utilization, promptly capacity degradation, and thus prevents its industrial application. Recently, the development of catalysts that can accelerate the conversion reaction of LiPSs has received tremendous attention. Herein, we use a novel in-situ one-step approach to prepare the Co5.42N/Fe3N heterostructure wrapped with the 3D nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube and graphene framework (3D Co5.42N/Fe3N@N-CNT-G). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the formation of Co5.42N/Fe3N heterostructures could improve the density of states at the Fermi level, which enhances the redox kinetics, LiPS conversion and adsorption capability. The combination of highly catalytic activity Fe3N and adsorptive Co5.42N in the abundant-heterojunctions Co5.42N/Fe3N nanostructure provide an effective trapping host and conversion catalyst for LiPS. Moreover, 3D N-CNT-G framework with high surface area serves as a highly conductive channel for electron transport and promote the Li2S nucleation. The sulfur-loaded 3D Co5.42N/Fe3N@N-CNT-G cathode exhibits an exceptional capacity of similar to 1293 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C and long cycle-life for 500 cycles (capacity fading of 0.029% per cycle at 1C).

Its theoretical capacity is 1675 mA h g(-1), much higher than that of conventional lithium-ion batteries. However, it suffers from rapid capacity decay and low energy efficiency. In this work, we introduce a novel dual core-shell structured sulfur composite with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and polypyrrole (PPy), MWCNTs@S@PPy, as a cathode material for Li-S batteries. The composite is synthesized via a facile one-pot method. In the structure, MWCNTs and PPy work as a combined conductive framework to provide access to Li+ ingress and egress for reaction with sulfur, and to inhibit the diffusion of polysulfide out of the cathode, and hence reduce the capacity decay. Meanwhile, LiNO3 additive is added into the electrolyte to improve the coulombic efficiency. The as-designed MWCNTs@S@PPy composite shows excellent rate capability and cyclability. The initial discharge specific capacity is as high as 1517 mA h g(-1), and remains at 917 mA h g(-1) after 60 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g(-1). Even at a high current density of 1500 mA g(-1), the composite still shows a good cycle performance with a capacity of 560 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles.

However, the intrinsic low reversible conversion ability of lithium polysulfides to sulfur/Li2S during charging/discharging seriously hinders the sulfur utilization, resulting in poor cycling life of batteries. Herein, we report an improvement of core-shell-structured sulfur nanospheres@ultrathin delta-MnO2 nanosheet electrode materials prepared by a simple precipitation reaction method, in which the ultrathin delta-MnO2 nanosheets as a catalytic layer can promote the chemical adsorption of lithium polysulfides and their conversion rates to sulfur/Li2S. Using a combination of the UV-visible adsorption spectra and first-principles calculation, the results indicate that the Mn-O coordination center on the surface of the MnO2 structure plays an efficient catalytic role in the conversion reaction of lithium polysulfides to insoluble S/Li2S. The sulfur nanospheresgultrathin delta-MnO2 nanosheet composite with a high S mass ratio of 82 wt % reveals a high specific capacity of 846 mA h g(-1) at 1 C rate and good cycling stability. Moreover, the areal capacity of the electrode with a high sulfur loading mass of 10 mg cm(-2). is 5.2 mA h cm(-2), approaching the practical application standard at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2).

Compared with typical electrospun carbon nanofiber composites, the as-prepared C@Ni/MnO composite fibers as interlayer enable MnO and Ni to contact fully with polysulfides rather than provide local contact surface. With the sulfur loading of 1.6 mg cm(-2) and the approximately 0.1 g composite fibers as interlayer, the cathode shows initial capacity of 687.36 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C and superior capacity retention of 70%. This simple technical route leads a way to prepare nanoparticles with highly exposed contact surfaces partially embedded in the carbon nanofibers, which can be applied in electrocatalysis.

Our results contribute to elucidate the failure mechanism of lithium-sulfur cathodes, and the new insight can be used to improve the cycle-life of lithium-sulfur batteries. Indeed, while the reversible dimensional changes are fundamentally unavoidable, the irreversible dimensional changes can be mitigated by preventing the loss of active materials during cycling, which should obviously improve the battery cycle-life.

However, due to the essential chemical S-linking and organic nature of SPAN, the active mass percentage and rate capability are two bottleneck issues preventing its ultimate deployment outside of laboratories. In the current work, aiming to endow both the charge conductivity and catalytic activity to SPAN for maximizing the redox kinetics of S conversion, a freestanding nanofibrous SPAN cathode embedding conductive CNTs and atomically dispersed Co centers is fabricated via multivariate electrospinning. While the CNTs enable dramatically enhancing the fiber conductivity and generating mesoscopic porosity for facilitating charge and mass transportation, the cross-linking of SPAN by Co-N4S motifs creates extra charge conduction pathways and further serves as the catalytic active sites for expediting redox S conversion. As a result, an extraordinary Li-SPAN performance is achieved with a high specific capacity up to 1856 mAh g(-1)@0.2 C, a superb rate capability up to 10 C, and an ultra-long battery life up to 1500 cycles@1 C. Consequently, our study here provides insights into the adoption of coordination chemistry to maximize the sulfur utilization by ensuring a more complete redox conversion from SPAN to Li2S, and vice versa.

However, affected by the shuttle effect and slow redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), the application of the Li-S batteries is seriously hampered. Herein, novel thorn-like carbon nanofibers combined with molybdenum nitride nanosheets (denoted as MoN@CNFs) were well designed as a modified separator coating for Li-S batteries to restrain the shuttle effect and strengthen the redox kinetics of LiPSs. The conductive carbon nanofibers provided fast electronic transport, and the decorated MoN nanosheets possessed strong affinity to sulfur species, which could effectively anchor LiPSs, boost their redox reaction as an electrocatalyst,accelerate the reversible soluble/insoluble phase conversion process, and greatly increase the efficiency of active substance utilization. As a result, the Li-S batteries with the separators modified by MoN@CNFs exhibited outstanding rate performance, stable cycling capacity, and improved reaction kinetics, which delivered a high initial capacity of 1074 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and sustained a capacity of 531 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 2 C, with only 0.055% capacity fade per cycle.

Even so, high-power performance is still far from satisfaction due to the expansion and collapse of the electrode materials during thousands of charge-discharge process. Herein, it is found that colloidal carbon sphere with high elastic coefficient can be utilized as a framework to load sulfur, which can trap soluble polysulfides species in the pores within the sphere and efficaciously improve the electronic conductivity of the cathode. After modified by polyaniline (PAN) through in situ polymerization, PAN-assisted S/C nanosphere (PSCs-73, with 73 wt % sulfur) effectively minimize polysulfide diffusion, enhance the electron transfer rate and overcome the problem of volume expansion. The fabricated PSCs-73 cell shows outstanding long high-power cycling capability over 2.500 charge/discharge cycles with a capacity decay of 0.01% per cycle at 5 C. Substantially, this composite can drive 2.28 W white indicators of LED robustly after minutes of charging by three lithium batteries in series, showing a promising potential application in the future.

Nonetheless, their practical applications have been hampered by critical challenges such as cycling instability, low sulfur utilisation and efficiency. Here, the interfacial growth of Ni(OH)(2)-encapsulated sulfur nanoparticles in a reduced graphene oxide free-standing matrix as Li S cathodes has been highlighted, along with a detailed application investigation of the sandwich foam structure in Li-S batteries. Compared to sulfur composites based solely on a graphene host (S@rGO), this composite foam cathode could provide significant improvements in specific capacity and long-cycle stability with the effective confinement and promoted conversion of lithium polysulfides. Moreover, the sandwich foam composite cathode exhibits a high specific capacity of 1189 mA h g(-1) (0.1 C), better rating performance (691 mA h g(-1) at 2 C) and remarkable cycling stability, retaining 81% of the initial capacity after 200 cycles of charge -discharge at 0.2 C. Furthermore, Ni(OH)(2) wrapping at the cathode-electrolyte interface offers vastly improved polysulfide shuttle suppression, which provides a new cathode encapsulation method for further developments of advanced Li-S cathodes.

Recently, porous carbon hosts derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted wide attention due to their unique spatial structure and customizable reaction sites. However, the loading and rate performance of Li-S cells are still restricted by the disordered pore distribution and surface catalysis in these hosts. Here, we propose a concept of built-in catalysis to accelerate lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) conversion in confined nanoreactors, i.e., laterally stacked ordered crevice pores encompassed by MoS2-decorated carbon thin layers. The functions of S-fixability and LiPS catalysis in these mesoporous cavity reactors benefit from the 2D interface contact between ultrathin catalytic MoS2 and conductive C pyrolyzed from AI-MOF. The integrated function of adsorption-catalysis-conversion endows the sulfur-infused c@mos(2) electrode with a high initial capacity of 1240 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C, long life cycle stability of at least 1000 cycles at 2 C, and high rate endurance up to 20 C. This electrode also exhibits commercial potential in view of considerable capacity release and reversibility under high sulfur loading (6 mg cm(-2) and , similar to 80 wt %) and lean electrolyte (E/S ratio of 5 mu L mg(-1) ). This study provides a promising design solution of a catalysis-conduction 2D interface in a 3D skeleton for high-loading Li-S batteries.

Nevertheless, there is still a major challenge on how to modulate the nanostructure of graphene architectures to further enhance the electrochemical performance. Herein, self-closure graphene aerogels with inbuilt baffle plates (SGA) were prepared by a combined strategy involving electrostatic assembly, hydrothermal fixing, polydopamine (PDA) coating, and annealing. The electrostatic assembly between graphene oxide (GO) and polystyrene sphere@polydopamine (PS@PDA) is the key factor to form the self-closure aerogels and the graphene sheets wrapped onto the PS@PDAs are responsible for the formation of the baffle plates. When employed as the host material for Li-S batteries, the as-made SGA can contribute to promotion of the transport of electrons, increasing the sulfur loading, confining the dissolution and diffusion of lithium polysulfides, and accommodating the volume expansion. As a result, the as-made SGA-sulfur composite can deliver an outstanding cycling stability of 509 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 1C. The present work will provide a simple and effective approach to tuning the assembly of graphene and further configuring the tailor-made host materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, the easy dissolution of intermediate polysulfides (Li2Sx, 4 < x <= 8) and insulating nature of sulfur have hindered their commercialization. Herein, we develop a novel confinement approach by using porous hollow carbon nanospheres (HCNs) embedded with well-dispersed cobalt monoxide (CoO) nanocrystals (CoO/HCN), which can effectively combine the advantages of physical entrapment and chemical binding interactions of sulfur species. When used as a sulfur host material, the CoO/HCN-S composite cathode with 1.4 mg cm(-2) sulfur exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with high discharge capacity (996 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C), great rate capability (620 mA h g(-1) at 5.0C) and superior cycle stability (629 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 1.0C with a capacity decay of only 0.033% per cycle and 482 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 2.0C with a capacity decay of only 0.043% per cycle). Furthermore, a high and stable reversible capacity of 640 mA h g(-1) after cycling for 250 cycles is achieved with a higher sulfur mass loading (3.6 mg cm(-2)).

However, applications of Li-S batteries have been obstructed by their fast capacity fading and low coulombic efficiency due to soluble polysulfide migration during charge/discharge cycling. Herein, we present a strategy utilizing cobalt metal-organic framework (CoMOF) with rough porous surface and defective structure as a host material for sulfur accommodation, which implements a CoMOF and S composite (CoMOF-S) as a cathode. Capacity retention of CoMOF-S cathode surpasses that of pure sulfur by 87.18% after 100 cycles at 0.1C, while achieving coulombic efficiency above 98% at a high rate of 2.0C. We reveal structural features by combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which confirm the covalent bond connection between CoMOF and S. We attribute the excellent cycling performance to covalent bond immobilization of sulfur.

Here, we prepare all-solid-state lithium secondary batteries combining sulfur as the active cathode material with argyrodite-type Li6PS5Br as the solid electrolyte. Composite cathode powder of sulfur, Li6PS5Br and super P carbon are fabricated by a two-step ball milling at high rotating speed of 500 rpm, yielding a uniform composite cathode mixture with a particle size smaller than 100 nm. The resulting all-solid-state S/Li6PS5Br/In-Li batteries with S contents varied over the range of 20-40 wt% show a maximum capacity of 1460 mAh/g (with respect to the weight of sulfur) and a reversible capacity of up to 1080 mAh/g after 50 cycles at C/10 rate. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) results demonstrate that Li6PS5Br undergoes no structural change throughout the cycling.

The adsorptions are classified as two categories which successfully distinguish S-S bond breaking from the others. Moreover, a general trend of polysulfides adsorption was established regarding of both kind of metal and the nitrogen configurations on support. The regression model has a mean absolute error of 0.14 eV which exhibited a faithful predictive ability. Based on adsorption energy of soluble polysulfides and overpotential, the most promising SAC was proposed, and a volcano curve was found. In the end, a reactivity map is supplied to guide SAC design of the Li-S battery.

While the poor cycling stability, due to the inherent polysulfide shuttle, seriously hampered their practical application. Recently, some polar hosts, like single metal oxides and sulfides, have been employed as hosts to interact with polysulfide intermediates. However, due to the inherent poor electrical conductivity of these polar hosts, a relatively low specific capacity is obtained. Herein, a spinel-type bimetal sulfide NiCo2S4 through a Prussian blue analogue derived methodology is reported as the novel host of polysulfide, which enables high-performance sulfur cathode with high Coulombic efficiency and low capacity decay. Notably, the Li-S battery with NiCo2S4-S composites cathode still maintains a capacity of 667 mAh/g at 0.5 C after 300 cycles, and 399 mAh/g at 1 C after 300 cycles. Even after 300 cycles at the current density of 0.5 C, the capacity decays by 0.138% per cycle at high sulfur loading about 3 mg/cm(2). And the capacity decays by 0.026% per cycle after 1000 cycles, when the rate is 1 C. More importantly, the cathode of NiCo2S4-S composite shows the outstanding discharge capacity, owing to its good conduction, high catalytic ability and the strong confinement of polysulfides.

However, the low sulfur loading, shuttling effect, poor cycling stability, fast capacity fading, volume expansion, and limited operating temperature conditions limit their practical applications. Herein, we have designed a nitrogen-enriched functionalized carbon-based interlayer using waste tissue paper. The nitrogen-enriched interwoven fibrous interlayer sieved Li+ and confined the polysulfides within the high-sulfur (75 wt % S)-loaded cathodes. The battery exhibited a 1256 mA h g(-1) capacity at 0.1C at 25 degrees C. At 1C, it attained 789 mA h g(-1) and maintained 738 mA h g(-1) over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 72%. A wide range of temperatures from 0 to 70 degrees C is suitable for a Li-S battery. At 70 degrees C, the Li-S battery delivered an outstanding cyclic performance at 1C over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 94.5%, an ultrahigh efficiency of 96%, and 0.01% capacity fade per cycle. Therefore, the facile strategy for the fabrication of the interlayer with the special network was effective for achieving high-performance Li-S batteries.

However, their intrinsic shortcomings hindered their practical commercialization. In this work, a powerful three-dimensional (3D) filter paper porous carbon decorated with cobalt (FPPC@Co) matrix is employed to fabricate high-quality anode and cathode simultaneously. Combining with in-situ surface engineering, the rationally designed solid electrolyte interphase @Li/FPPC@Co anodes can plate/strip Li uniformly without Li dendrites, manifesting a low overpotential of about 20 mV for 1000 h at 1 mA/cm(2)/1 mA h/cm(2). COMSOL Multiphysics simulations further testify the underlying mechanisms. Meanwhile, with the help of molten sulfurizing method, the synthesized FPPC@Co/S cathode exhibits excellent stability with high capacity retention of 73.3% after 200 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, we paired SEI@Li/FPPC@Co anode and FPPC@Co/S cathode to assemble lithium-sulfur full cells. The SEI@Li/FPPC@Co||FPPC@Co/S full cell shows superior electrochemical performance with a long-term cycle life (a capacity retention of 88.7% after 200 cycles at 1 C). Insight gained from this work opens a new door for fabrication of high-quality electrodes for LSBs. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A high capacity of 913 mA h g(-1) has been achieved at a rate of 0.2C in the initial cycle for the TiO2/S composite cathode with a sulfur content of 65 wt% and the reversible capacity remains as high as 851 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles.

However, the migration and conversion pathway of LiPSs is seriously confined at a localized interface with inadequate active sites. In this work, the introduction of selenium vacancies into VSe2-x has been demonstrated to successfully synergize the adsorbability and catalytic reactions of LiPSs at an integrated functional surface. The N-doped carbon nanosheets-assembled flower architectures embedded with selenium vacancy-rich VSe2-x and partial vanadium oxides have been controllably synthesized and employed as the cathode additives for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Both the experiments and first-principle calculations reveal their strong adsorption to LiPSs and their bidirectional catalytic functionality towards the conversion between S-8 and Li2S. As expected, the charge and discharge kinetics of VSe2-x containing sulfur cathodes is fundamentally improved (an outstanding rate capabilitiy with 693.7 mAh.g(-1) at 2 C, a remarkable long-term cyclability within 1,000 cycles at 2 C with S loading 2.27 mg.cm(-2), and an excellent areal capacity with 3.44 mAh.cm(-2) within 100 cycles at 0.5 C). This work presents an effective resolution to couple the adsorbability and catalytic reactions of LiPSs at the material design perspective, and the insights on bidirectional catalytic functionality are of vital to develop functional materials for advanced Li-S batteries.

The structure of thenew material deviates from the typical planar interlayer pi-stacking of the COFto form undulated layers caused by bending along the C-S-C bridge,without loss of aromaticity and crystallinity of the overall COF structure.Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations of the COF and amodel compound, featuring the thianthrene moiety, suggest partialdelocalization of sulfur lone pair electrons over the aromatic backbone ofthe COF decreasing the band gap and promoting redox activity. Postsynthetic sulfurization allows for direct covalent attachment ofpolysulfides to the carbon backbone of the framework to afford a molecular-designed cathode material for lithium-sulfur (Li-S)batteries with a minimized polysulfide shuttle. The fabricated coin cell delivers nearly 77% of the initial capacity even after 500charge-discharge cycles at 500 mA/g current density.

However, substantial capacity decay, miserable cycle life, and meagre stability remain critical challenges. More specifically, shuttling of polysulfide (Li2S (x) (3 < x <= 8)) species severely hinders the cycle performance resulting in capacity fade and cycling instability. In the present work, a highly conducting three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanofiber (CNF) foam has been synthesized using the lyophilization method followed by thermal pyrolysis. The highly porous foam materials have a bimodal porosity distribution in the nano and micro regime and were successfully investigated to serve as a potential host for sulfur species intended for Li-S battery application. 3D x-ray microtomography was employed to estimate the nature of sulfur impregnation and distribution in the 3D porous networks. On utilizing the final product as cathode material, sulfur impregnated carbonized CNF foam and modified the separator with functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes delivered a specific capacity of similar to 845 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1).

This double-layer membrane separator delivers two different functionalities: (i) the porous PVDF nanofiber framework in both rGO-PVDF and PVDF layers provides good thermal stability and maintains the structural integrity of the separator; and (ii) the conductive rGO-PVDF layer serves as a polysulfide inhibitor and ensures the fast transfer of lithium ions. Compared to conventional polypropylene membrane separators, this new separator design can significantly enhance the cycling stability and rate capability of the incorporated lithium-sulfur batteries. Overall, it is demonstrated that this new double-layer rGO-PVDF/PVDF composite membrane separator opens an alternate avenue in the structural design of high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries in dealing with multiple challenges.

The interlayer has a labyrinth-like structure with plenty of nanosized holes to achieve the permselectivity for Li ions and effective intercept for polysulfides. The coin cell with the interlayer shows a high initial discharge capacity of 1263.5 mAh/g at 0.2 C, a low capacity fading rate of 0.0487% per cycle for 300 cycles at 1 C, and an excellent rate performance of 864.6 mAh/g at 2 C. Moreover, this cell also has excellent anti-self-discharge property and a high areal capacity of 6.1 mA h/cm(2) at a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg/cm(2) using aluminum foil as the current collector. Thus, this work suggests the permselective and multifunctional interlayer as a practical and effective strategy for the application in the high-performance Li-S battery.

However, serious lithium polysulfides (LiPS) shuttle effect and the insulating property of sulfur restrict the practical application of Li-S batteries. In this work, we put forward an efficient strategy to anchor soluble LiPS through a combination of physical adsorption and chemical conversion, which is accomplished by using a heterostructure of V2O5 hollow spheres wrapped in nitrogen-doped graphene network (VOHS/NG) as the sulfur host. The nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) network not only provides excellent conductivity but also traps the LiPS rapidly with high specific surface area. The initially adsorbed LiPS chemically react with V2O5 hollow spheres (VOHS) to form thiosulfate intermediates. These intermediates convert the soluble "high-order" LiPS to insoluble "low-order" LiPS. Hence, the shuttle effect can be restrained efficiently. Owing to the physical and chemical synergy of the two components, the VOHS/NG heterostructure with 71 wt% sulfur can deliver superior rate performance and excellent cycling stability. A high specific capacity of 970 mAh g(-1) can be obtained after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. Even cycled at 2 C for 1000 times, a reversible capability of 623 mAh g(-1) can still be achieved with the decay rate as low as 0.017% per cycle.

Using sulfur cathodes based on metal oxide nanocomposite materials has been proven to be an effective method to overcome the abovementioned problems and accomplish long-term cycle stability, excellent conductivity, and high-rate capacity. However, there is still a lack of clear mechanism research to balance between adsorption and diffusion and speedy selection method for oxides. Herein, we systematically studied the anchoring and diffusion properties of metal oxide MO2 (TiO2, SnO2, and RuO2) as cathode materials and then screened the materials through the equilibrium mechanism of adsorption and diffusion. According to the abovementioned research, due to its strong interaction with lithium polysulfides and low diffusion barrier for Li+, TiO2 exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and is considered to have great potential as an anchor material for lithium-sulfur batteries. Therefore, a comprehensive metal oxide selection criterion with stronger bonding strength (3-5 eV) and a lower diffusion barrier (<0.4 eV) is proposed. This work provides general guidance for the construction and screening of cathode materials to attain high-performance batteries in the future.

However, the low active material utilization, severe capacity fading, and short lifespan of the resultant lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have greatly hindered their practicality. In this work, a multi-functional polyacrylonitrile/silica nanofiber membrane with an integral ultralight and thin multi-walled carbon nanotube sheet is presented and it provides a new approach to significantly improve the overall electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries. The experimental results are in agreement with molecular modeling studies based on density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, this design is favorable for the fast diffusion of both lithium ions and electrons and the mitigation of the diffusion of polysulfides. As a consequence, a high reversible capacity of 741 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 100 cycles with excellent cyclability and high-rate performance (627 mA h g(-1) at 1C) are achieved even with a high sulfur loading of 70 wt% in the cathode, revealing its great potential for energy storage applications. Moreover, a capacity of 426 mA h g(-1) is retained after 300 cycles at a high current density of 2C. These results represent a major step forward in the progress of Li-S battery technologies.

Graphene can provide a more efficient conductive network for sulfur and improve the coulombic efficiency of the battery. On the other hand, it may also show the anchoring effect on sulfur, which reduces the loss of sulfur and improves the cycling performance of the battery. Due to the unique structure, the initial discharge capacity of a battery assembled with this structure could reach 1036mAhg(-1) at 0.1 C, and its reversible capacity of 619mAhg(-1) was retained after 200 cycles with a low fading rate of 0.2% per cycle. The battery could hold a discharge capacity of 501mAhg(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. Thus, the electrochemical performance improved because of the reduction of sulfur loss through polysulfide accumulation at the cathode.

However, the precise preparation of SACs with controllable M-N coordination number remains challenging and the relationship between M-N coordination number and polysulfide redox kinetics is still unexplored. Herein, a novel exfoliation-evaporation strategy assisted by molten salt is proposed to fabricate Co SACs (named Co-N-x) with different N coordination numbers for Li-S batteries. The key of this strategy is to exfoliate layered Co-based ZIF-L precursors into N-doped graphene with abundant dispersed Co atoms by molten salt and then control Co-N coordination number by selectively introducing Zn evaporation to promote C-N fragments release. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that highly unsaturated Co-N-2 with asymmetric electron distribution immobilizes LiPSs, accelerates LiPSs conversion, and promotes Li2S deposition/dissociation more effectively than Co-N-4 through stronger chemical interactions. As a result, Co-N-2 endows Li-S batteries with long cycle life (0.05% capacity decay per cycle for 700 cycles), excellent rate capability (687 mAh g(-1) at 5 C), and high areal capacity of 8.2 mAh cm(-2) at a high loading of 7.0 mg cm(-2). This work provides an effective strategy to fabricate SACs with controllable N coordination number and establishes the relationship between M-N coordination number and LiPSs redox kinetics, motivating future rational design of SACs for high-performance Li-S batteries.

J	Liu, SF; Li, CF; Liu, DC				Liu, Shoufa; Li, Chunfeng; Liu, Dancheng			Modified Separator Based on mesoporous carbon/TiO2 composites as Advanced Polysulfide Adsorber for High Electrochemical Performance Li-S Batteries	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Mesoporous Carbon; TiO2; Capacity; Polysulfide; Cycling performance		Lithium-sulfur batteries have been drawn much attention for the researchers due to their high energy density low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the severe polysulfide dissolution and poor electronic conductivity limit the actual electrochemical performance. Separator modification is considered as a promising method to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. Herein, we develop mesoporous carbon/TiO2 (MC/TO) composites as the modifying materials on the surface of the pure separator. The polar metal oxide TiO2 on the modified separator could adsorb the polysulfide while the mesoporous graphitic carbon could improve the electronic conductivity at the same time. Owing to the above merits, the lithium-sulfur batteries with MC/TO modified separator display excellent electrochemical performance with a capacity of 658 mAh g(-1) at 2 C over 500 electrochemical cycles. This work provides a promising strategy to design modified separator which could inhibit the polysulfide dissolution and accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics, therefore obtaining high electrochemical performance Li-S batteries.

The limited cost of raw materials as well as the very simple synthetic procedures, involving planetary ball milling (for S-C cathode) and solvent casting (for PEO-electrolyte), are expected to reflect into remarkable reduction of the economic impact of the proposed battery. Furthermore, the high energy of the Li-S cell and safety of the polymer configuration represent additional bonuses of the system. The S-C material, revealing a maximum capacity as high as 700 mAh g(-1) in liquid electrolyte, is employed in a lithium-sulfur battery with the polymer configuration. The polymer cell delivers a capacity of 450 mAh g(-1) at a voltage of about 2 V; hence, a theoretical energy density of 900 Wh kg(-1) that may reflect into a high practical value, suitable for energy storage applications.

Nevertheless, the substantial capacity degradation caused by the polysulfide shuttling during charging and discharging has seriously hindered the commercialization of LSBs. Separator modification with functionalized carbon materials has been found to catalyze the breakdown of polysulfides, thereby improving the efficiency of LSBs. Herein, we synthesized Ni/Co-PBAs with KB structures to subsequently derive Ni/Co/KB composites by a carbonization process, which were later used as a modifier layer on the barrier in LSBs in order to effectively alleviate the shuttle problem. The capacity of the Ni/Co/KB composite decorated separator is found to be 1032 mAh/g at 0.5 C with a coulombic efficiency closer to 100%. In the long-term cycling capability evaluation, the initial cycle is approximately 802.9 mAh/g at 1 C, while capacity retention after 400 cycles is also 678.8 mAh/g, with a high-capacity retention rate of 84.5%. The potential of these composites as modifying materials for superior LSBs separators is verified by experimental and theoretical methods. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A rapid heating process was used to synthesis the sulfur nanosheets. Hierarchical porous carbon materials were prepared by carbonization of silk cocoon (sC). The sulfur nanosheets and carbonized silk cocoon nanocomposite were prepared by simple melt-diffusion method. The morphology and anchoring of sulfur nanosheets on carbonized silk cocoon were confirmed by SEM and TEM studies. The Raman spectroscopy measurement was employed to verify the formation of graphitic carbon nanostructure. The electrochemical performance of sulfur and carbonized silk cocoon (S-sC) nanocomposite sample showed 1231 mAh/g discharge capacity at 0.05 C. The capacity retention of the sample was about 997 mAh/g after 50 cycles. This nanocomposite material plays a vital role in improving electrochemical performance.

Nevertheless, blocked by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LPSs, Li2S4-Li2S8) and insulation of sulfur, LSBs show rapid capacity loss and cannot achieve the practical application. Herein, a composite of carbon nanofibers coated by Co(3)S(4)nanosheets (denoted as CNF@Co3S4) is successfully synthesized as freestanding sulfur host to optimize the interaction with sulfur species. The combination of the two materials can lead extraordinary cycling and rate performance by alleviating the shuttle of LPSs effectively. N-doped carbon nanofibers serve as long-range conductive networks and Co(3)S(4)nanosheets can accelerate the conversion of LPSs through its electrocatalytic and chemical adsorption ability. Benefiting from the unique structure, the transporting rate of Li(+)can be enhanced. Distribution of Li(+)is uniform for enough exposed negative active sites. As a result, the cell with CNF@Co(3)S(4)as sulfur host is able to stabilize at 710 mA h g(-1)at 1 C after 200 cycles with average coulombic efficiency of 97.8% in a sulfur loading of 1.7 mg cm(-2)and deliver 4.1 mA h cm(-2)at 0.1 C even in 6.8 mg cm(-2)for 100 cycles.

However, the polysulfides shuttling, low electronic conductivity of sulfur and its solid reduction products, as well as the large volume expansion during S <-> Li2S transformation are the main obstacles to prohibit their commercialization. Here we to resolve these problems, by using N,P-codoped mesoporous carbon coated with rGO protective layers as sulfur host and rGO as conductive binder. The N,P-codoped mesoporous carbon could provide both physical adsorption and chemical interactions due to the micro/mesoporous pore structures, high surface area and P-S bonds, O-S bonds as well as good surface affinity. The rGO protective layers could well entrap sulfur in the host materials and inhibit polysulfides escaping from cathodes and shuttling. Most importantly, this protective layers combined with rGO conductive binders could also form a continuous conductive networks for electrons transportation, Li ions transfer channels through atomic scaled defects and mechanical protection layers to accommodate the severe volume expansion and finally ensuring 80-90 wt% sulfur loading in the cathode material. The unique designed cathodes exhibit excellent electrochemical performances with specific capacity as high as 1469 mAh/g at 0.1 C, a reversible specific capacity of 977 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.5 C rate and a low self-discharge behavior.

The chemical reaction-deposition strategy provides intimate contact between the S and the CNFs. This would not necessarily be the case for other reported methods, such as ball milling and thermal treatment. These novel porous carbon nanofiber-sulfur (CNF-S) nanocomposites with various S loadings showed high reversible capacity, good discharge capacity retention and enhanced rate capability when they were used as cathodes in rechargeable Li/S cells. We demonstrated here that an electrode prepared from a porous CNF-S nanocomposite with 42 wt% S maintains a stable discharge capacity of about 1400 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C, 1100 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and 900 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C. We attribute the good electrochemical performance to the high electrical conductivity and the extremely high surface area of the CNFs that homogeneously disperse and immobilize S on their porous structures, alleviating the polysulfide shuttle phenomenon. SEM measurements showed that the porous CNF structures remained nearly unchanged even after 30 cycles' discharging/charging at 0.05 C.

However, the notorious shuttle effect caused by the soluble polysulfides as well as the sluggish redox kinetics significantly hinders the practical application. Herein, sulfiphilic iron disulfide (FeS2) nanoparticles caged in the hollow carbon shell have been facilely fabricated as the sulfur host (FeS2@C-S) for Li-S batteries. The deposited amorphous carbon cage with hollow space can provide efficient pathways for electrons, facilitate electrolyte penetration, and effectively accommodate the volume change during the repeated charge/discharge process. In addition, polar FeS2 nanoparticles have strong chemical interaction on the polysulfides and can promote the redox conversion of polysulfides as an electrocatalyst. Visible adsorption and electrochemical analysis have been conducted to confirm the static polysulfide trapping capability and dynamic polysulfide conversion reversibility. Synergistically, the FeS2@C-S cathode with a sulfur loading of similar to 1.5 mg cm(-2) exhibits high cycle stability with a reversible capacity of ca. 800 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C and excellent rate performance. Even at the current density of 5 C, a capacity of ca. 400 mA h g(-1) can still be achieved after 400 cycles. This work provides a feasible approach to provide both physical and chemical protection against polysulfides resulting from the synergistic effects of multifunctional units during the sulfur cathode development.

However, the dissolution and diffusion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), as well as the insulating property of sulfur and its discharge products, limit the practical application of Li-S battery. In this work, we developed an ultralight functional separator (LBL-fseparator) with orderly structure and multifunctional properties through electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly of positively charged poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA) wrapped covalent triazine framework (CTF) (CTF@PDDA) and negatively charged poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) to effectively retard LiPS shuttle and improve the utilization of active sulfur material. The CTF@PDDA as LiPS shuttle inhibiting layers displays strong LiPS-anchor ability through physical/chemical interaction as well as excellent electrolyte uptake capacity due to its large specific surface area and porous structure, while the PEDOT: PSS as the conductive layers improves electron transfer as well as excellent interface stabilizer and adhesion binder. It was demonstrated that the proposed LBL-fseparator assembled with general S-cathode and Li metal anode displays commendable cycling stability (0.052% capacity fade-rate per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1C), superb utilization of sulfur (90.7% at 0.1C and 59.2% at 2C), and enhanced protection ability of the Li metal. The excellent battery performance and easily mass-produced method provide a useful strategy for industrial-scale production.

Here, a class of 3D nanocomposite architecture characterised by a necklace-like structure that contains intertwined carbon-nanotubes (CNTs) and defective Prussian blue (PB) nanocrystals is developed as the sulfur host. Benefiting from the fact that a 3D CNT conductive skeleton can provide efficient ion/electron channels and the abundant Lewis acidic sites in PB can effectively entrap lithium polysulfide (LiPS) species, the S@PB/CNT composite cathode exhibits high reversibility, stable cycling performance, and fast kinetics. More importantly, the LiPS adsorption capacity of PB materials and the kinetics of LiPS conversion on PB is highly dependent on the amount of [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies based on both theoretical and experimental studies, which may further shed light on the interfacial phenomena between the PB sulfur host and soluble LiPS in the electrolyte.

J	Li, N; Xie, Y; Peng, ST; Xiong, X; Han, K				Li, Nuo; Xie, Ying; Peng, Shuting; Xiong, Xiang; Han, Kai			Ultra-lightweight Ti3C2Tx MXene modified separator for Li-S batteries: Thickness regulation enabled polysulfide inhibition and lithium ion transportation	JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Lithium sulfur batteries; Separator; MXene; Thicknesses; 2D materials	HIGH-PERFORMANCE; LONG-LIFE; FUNCTIONALIZED SEPARATORS; SULFUR; MEMBRANE; CONVERSION; CATHODE; ROBUST	The practical application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is limited by the easy dissolution of polysulfides in the electrolyte, resulting in the lithium polysulfide (LPS) shuttle effect. Several two-dimensional (2D) materials with abundant active binding sites and high surface-to-volume ratios have been developed to prepare functional separators that suppress the diffusion of polysulfides. However, the influence of modified layer thickness on Li+ transport has not been considered. Herein, we synthesized individual and multilayered 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and used them to fabricate a series of Ti3C2Tx-PP modified separators. The separators had mass loadings ranging from 0.16 to 0.016 mg cm(-2), which is the lowest value reported for 2D materials to the best of our knowledge. The corresponding reductions in thickness ranged from 1.2 mu m to 100 nm. LPS shuttling was effectively suppressed, even at the lowest mass loading of 0.016 mg cm(-2). Suppression was due to the strong interaction between LPS intermediates and Ti atoms and hydroxyl functional groups on the separator surface. The lithium-ion diffusion coefficient increased with the reduction of Ti3C2Tx layers on the separator. Superior cycling stability and rate performance were attained when the separator with a Ti3C2Tx-PP mass loading of 0.016 mg cm(-2) was incorporated into a Li-S battery. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were introduced into the separators to further improve the electrical and Li+ ionic conductivity in the cross-plane direction of the 2D Ti3C2Tx layers. With the ultra-lightweight Ti3C2Tx/CNTs modified PP separator, the cell maintained a capacity of 640 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 C with a capacity decay of only 0.079% per cycle.

Dissolution of lithium polysulfides, volume expansion of sulfur and uncontrollable deposition of lithium sulfide are three of the main challenges for this technology. State-of-the-art sulfur cathodes based on metal-oxide nanostructures can suppress the shuttle-effect and enable controlled lithium sulfide deposition. However, a clear mechanistic understanding and corresponding selection criteria for the oxides are still lacking. Herein, various nonconductive metal-oxide nanoparticle-decorated carbon flakes are synthesized via a facile biotemplating method. The cathodes based on magnesium oxide, cerium oxide and lanthanum oxide show enhanced cycling performance. Adsorption experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that polysulfide capture by the oxides is via monolayered chemisorption. Moreover, we show that better surface diffusion leads to higher deposition efficiency of sulfide species on electrodes. Hence, oxide selection is proposed to balance optimization between sulfide-adsorption and diffusion on the oxides.

Facile, Solvent-Free Preparation of High Density, High Mass Loading Sulfur Cathodes Enabled by Dry-Pressable Holey Graphene Scaffolds	BATTERIES & SUPERCAPS			English	Article						lithium-sulfur batteries; holey graphene; high mass loading; solvent-free; volumetric capacity	LONG-LIFE; BATTERIES; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODES; FABRICATION; CAPACITY; OXIDE	For lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries to be practically applicable in large scale, high mass loading and high S content are required for the sulfur (S) cathodes. Most reported S cathode preparation procedures, such as melt infiltration of S into carbon scaffolds followed by conventional solvent-based slurry casting, are time-consuming, costly, and lack control with respect to the electrode composition and quality. Here we report the use of a facile room-temperature procedure that is especially useful in the preparation of high density, high mass loading S cathodes with convenient control of S content and electrode architecture. The solvent-free and binder-free procedure is enabled by the use of holey graphene (hG) as a unique dry-pressable electrode scaffold host to effectively encapsulate S in the conductive matrix. The entire process can be completed within just a few minutes at room temperature, in comparison to much longer time required for most other methods. With effective S utilization, the high mass loadings and high densities of the dry-pressed hG-hosted S cathodes result in excellent areal (up to 20 mAh/cm(2)) and volumetric performance (1787 mAh/cm(3) is the highest reported to date), respectively. The hG-enabled dry-press method therefore offers an attractive processing option for S composite cathode fabrication toward practical applications.

However, the poor conductivity of sulfur and feeble stability arisen from the dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) hinder its further application. In this work, a core-shell structure S@PPy/CB, in which sulfur is coated by the polypyrrole (PPy)-scattered carbon black (CB) via the in situ pyrrole polymerization and carbon disperse approach, is successfully synthesized. The S@PPy/CB with excellent conductivity effectively confines the shuttle effect of polysulfides and significantly enhances the utilization of sulfur. Prominently, the S@PPy/CB electrode (sulfur content of 72%) delivers a discharge capacity of 1301 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C and 888 mAh g(-1) can be maintained after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, exhibiting an outstanding performance. Additionally, the S@PPy/CB composite displays an outstanding capability of confining LiPSs, providing a prospective strategy for wide application of lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, when the anode is selected from lithium metal, it exhibits strong chemical activity since the electrolyte using an organic system and is liable to form lithium dendrites, leading to short lifespan and serious safety hazards. Here, we successfully synthesized the hollow germanium (and sulfur) nanocrystals tightly loaded on graphene nanosheets (Ge-HS/GNs and S-HS/GNs) architecture, and developed a novel configured lithiated germanium-sulfur battery by using lithiated Ge-HS/GNs as anode and S-HS/GNs as cathode. It is worth noting that the full battery displayed a high specific capacity of 586 mA h g(-1) and energy density of 1025 W h kg(-1) at 0.8 A g(-1), outstanding rate performance (> 400 mA h g(-1) under 16 A g(-1)) and maintain a superior cycling stability over 500 cycles under 0.8 A g(-1) (ultraslow capacity loss of 0.015% per cycle).

Here we discover that some of those materials can play an important role as an activation catalyst to facilitate oxidation of the discharge product, Li2S, back to the charge product, sulfur. Combining theoretical calculations and experimental design, we select a series of metal sulfides as a model system to identify the key parameters in determining the energy barrier for Li2S oxidation and polysulfide adsorption. We demonstrate that the Li2S decomposition energy barrier is associated with the binding between isolated Li ions and the sulfur in sulfides; this is the main reason that sulfide materials can induce lower overpotential compared with commonly used carbon materials. Fundamental understanding of this reaction process is a crucial step toward rational design and screening of materials to achieve high reversible capacity and long cycle life in Li-S batteries.

However, physical confinement alone is currently not enough to reduce the lithium polysulfide (Li2Sn, 4 <= n <= 8, LIPSs) shuttle effect with sluggish LIPS-dissolving kinetics. In this work, we have integrated spatial confinement with a polar catalyst, and designed a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected, Co decorated and N doped porous carbon nanofiber (Co/N-PCNF) network. This Co/N-PCNF film serves as a freestanding host for sulfur trapping, which could effectively facilitate the infiltration of electrolyte and electron transport. In addition, the polar Co species possess strong chemisorption with LIPSs, catalyzing their reaction kinetics as well. As a result of this rational design and integration, the Co/N-PCNF@S cathode with a sulfur loading of 2 mg cm(-2) exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 878 mA h g(-1) at 1C, and maintains a discharge capacity of 728 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. Even with high sulfur loading of 9.33 mg cm(-2), the cathode still keeps a stable areal capacity of 7.16 mA h cm(-2) at 0.2C after 100 cycles, which is much higher than the current areal capacity (4 mA h cm(-2)) of commercialized lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This rational design may provide a new approach for future development of high-density Li-S batteries with high sulfur loading.

J	Jia, L; Li, HY; Zhu, WT; Qiu, XP				Jia, Lei; Li, Huiyu; Zhu, Wentao; Qiu, Xinping			Silicon dioxide molecular sieve with mono-layer carbon deposited in the channels and carbon nanotubes on the outside for lithium-sulfur batteries	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article								Sulfur has been investigated as a candidate cathode material for the next generation lithium battery due to its high specific capacity (1675 mA h g(-1)). Moreover, sulfur is abundant, cheap and environmental friendly. However, the insulation behaviour of sulfur and lithium sulfide as well as the solubility of polysulfides hinders the commercial application of lithium sulfur batteries. In this article, a novel sulfur host matrix prepared by the deposition of mono-layer carbon into and carbon nanotubes outside silicon dioxide molecular sieve channels and particle surfaces is proposed. The mono-layer carbon and carbon nanotubes can simultaneously improve the conductivity of the composite and decrease the polarization phenomenon. The composite not only keeps the mesoporous structure belonging to the silicon dioxide molecular sieve intact, but also possesses high electron conductivity due to the deposition of carbon. After sulfur impregnation, the composite exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) and good cycle stability of 250 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a rate of 0.1C, corresponding to a low capacity decay rate of about 0.81% per cycle.

Sulfur is impregnated in nitrogen-doped graphene and constructed as primary active material, which is further welded in the carbon nanotube/nanofibrillated cellulose (CNT/NFC) framework. Interconnected CNT/NFC layers on both sides of active layer are uniquely synthesized to entrap polysulfide species and supply efficient electron transport. The 3D composite network creates a hierarchical architecture with outstanding electrical and mechanical properties. Synergistic effects generated from physical and chemical interaction could effectively alleviate the dissolution and shuttling of the polysulfide ions. Theoretical calculations reveal the hydroxyl functionization exhibits a strong chemical binding with the discharge product (i.e., Li2S). Electrochemical measurements suggest that the rationally designed structure endows the electrode with high specific capacity and excellent rate performance. Specifically, the electrode with high areal sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm(-2) exhibits an areal capacity of approximate to 8 mA h cm(-2) and an ultralow capacity fading of 0.067% per cycle over 1000 discharge/charge cycles at C/2 rate, while the average coulombic efficiency is around 97.3%, indicating good electrochemical reversibility. This novel and low-cost fabrication procedure is readily scalable and provides a promising avenue for potential industrial applications.

However, shuttling and sluggish conversion of polysulfides to solid lithium sulfides limit the full utilization of active materials. Physical/chemical confinement is useful for anchoring polysulfides, but not effective for utilizing the blocked intermediates. Here, we employ black phosphorus quantum dots as electrocatalysts to overcome these issues. Both the experimental and theoretical results reveal that black phosphorus quantum dots effectively adsorb and catalyze polysulfide conversion. The activity is attributed to the numerous catalytically active sites on the edges of the quantum dots. In the presence of a small amount of black phosphorus quantum dots, the porous carbon/sulfur cathodes exhibit rapid reaction kinetics and no shuttling of polysulfides, enabling a low capacity fading rate (0.027% per cycle over 1000 cycles) and high areal capacities. Our findings demonstrate application of a metal-free quantum dot catalyst for high energy rechargeable batteries.

Carbon materials have been developed as conductive scaffolds to improve the electrical conductivity of sulfur, and as a coating layer of the separator to restrain the shuttling effect of polysulfide. However, previous designs of the Li-S battery lack a good adhesion between the cathode and the separator, thus motivating further research on design and materials selection to achieve the optimal battery performance. Herein, the free-standing oxygen plasma functionalized three-dimensional graphene-sulfur (O3DG-S)/polypropylene (OPP) separator composite introduces for the first-time, tri-functional structure (TFS) in a Li-S battery: a current collector, cathode material and a part of the separator. The O3DG exhibited a moderate electrical conductivity, with very good mechanical integrity, making it a promising candidate as a flexible current collector, as well as a scaffold for sulfur. The unique surface morphology of O3DG-S treated by oxygen plasma functionalization for promoting a seamless contact with commercial PP separator for a "Janus type" multifunctional separator structure. The TFS showed a capacity of similar to 1400 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C with a sulfur loading of similar to 70 wt% and a high cyclic performance of Li-S battery. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the poor conductivity of S and the shuttle effect of polysulfides are a bottleneck to practical applications. Herein, a three-dimensional architecture, based on carbon nanotube (CNT) bridged Ti2C MXene nanosheets, was constructed as a sulfur host. This architecture was based on Ti atoms, which can chemically absorb polysulfides. The CNTs are highly conductive and intercalate into the MXene nanosheets to prevent their stacking and construct an interspace for polysulfides. This hybrid, as a host of S, can effectively alleviate the shuttle effect through a combination of physical confinement and chemical adsorption. This resulted in an open internal space, which served as a cathode for the loaded S to promote electron transport and enhance electrochemical kinetics of the polysulfide conversion in Li-S batteries.

However, the sluggish kinetics of the nucleation and growth of the solid discharge product of Li2S/Li2S2 in the lower discharge plateau has been recently identified as a critical hurdle for attaining high specific capacity in Li-S batteries with high sulfur loadings under lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, a new strategy of breaking the charge-transport bottleneck by successful generation of experimentally verified stable Li2S2 and a reservoir of quasi-solid lithium polysulfides within the micropores of activated carbon fiber cloth as a high-sulfur-loading host is proposed. The developed Li-S cell is capable of delivering a highly sustainable areal capacity of 6.0 mAh cm(-2) under lower electrolyte to sulfur ratios (<3.0 mL(E) g(S)(-1)). Micropore confinement leads to generation of solid Li2S2 that enables high utilization of the entire electroactive area by its inherent self-healing capacity. This strategy opens a new avenue for rational material designs for Li-S batteries under lean electrolyte condition.

Herein, hollow polar nickel selenide (Ni3Se4) with various architectures was designed and employed as a carbon-free sulfur immobilizer. Among them, hollow sea urchins like Ni3Se4 with high porosity (0.39 cm 3 g(-1)) and large specific surface area (82.7 m(2) g(-1)) exhibit abundant adsorptive and electrocatalytic sites, which pledge excellent electrochemical performances of the Li-S battery. Correspondingly, the Ni3Se4 based sulfur electrode presents excellent rate endurability (581 mAh g(-composite)(-1) at 2.0 C) and superior cycle stability (ultralow fading rate of 0.042% per cycle during the 1000 cycles at 1.0 C). More importantly, thanks to the higher tap density (Ni3Se4/S: 1.57 g cm(-3) vs super P/S: 0.7 g cm(-3)), the volumetric specific capacity of Ni3Se4-based cathodes is as high as 1699 mAh cm(-composite)(-3) at 0.1 C, which is almost 2.8 times that of the carbonaceous electrode. Hence, rational transition metal selenide architecture design with synergistic function of good conductivity, well-defined catalyst and adsorption, as well as high tap density provide a promising route toward high gravimetric and volumetric energy density of Li-S batteries.

Herein, MXene-based flexible sulfur cathodes utilizing V2C/VO2 nanoribbon intertwined V2C/VO2 nanosheet (VCOR-VCOS) dual heterostructures as skeleton matrices are designed, in which the V2C/VO2 nanoribbon is in situ pillared between the adjacent V2C/VO2 layers during the hydrothermal process, providing a lightweight sandwich-type architecture with high mechanical robustness, unobstructed electron/Li+ ion transfer and catalytic properties for LiPS redox reactions. By virtue of these preponderances of VCOR-VCOS, pouch cells with an areal S loading of 6.0 mg cm(-2) and an electrolyte to sulfur ratio of 4.5 mu L mg(-1) deliver a superior areal capacity of 6.3 mA h cm(-2) and excellent capacity retention under arbitrary bending conditions, which provide a ponderable reference for future flexible electronic devices.

Herein, we present a unique ternary S/C@SnO2 composite consisting of a 3D tubular core-shell structure in which a carbon matrix as the core is coated by a porous SnO2 shell. Sulfur is coated on carbon inside the tubes. The S/C@SnO2 exhibits a good electrochemical performance including a stable capacity of 730 mAh g(-1) after cycling for 500 times at 0.1C, along with a fading rate as low as 0.07% per cycle. The capacities recover well during two rounds of rate-performance measurements, exhibiting a recovery rate exceeding 96.3%. The composite also delivers stable capacities when cycling at different charge vs. discharge rates. The polysulfides-adsorptive capability of the SnO2 shell as an efficient protection shield is demonstrated through density functional theory calculation, which confirms a high surface-energy of SnO2 towards Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8. The porous carbon matrix inside the SnO2 tubes provides a good conductivity for sulfur and spaces for the volume-change of sulfur. Those features of the ternary S/C@SnO2 enable it to be a promising cathode candidate for Li-S batteries.

However, poor utilization of sulfur and sluggish reaction kinetics leads to unsatisfactory performance of these batteries. Herein, we tune the electrical properties of a carbon cloth derived from waste cotton by suitably selecting the carbonization temperature and utilize it as a current collector in LSB. The fibrous architecture with enhanced electrical conductivity provides efficient channels for electron transport leading to better activation of sulfur. As a result, LSB delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1171 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C rate. Further, LSB cell with addition of a second layer as upper collector between cathode and separator exhibits a high initial capacity of 592 mA h g(-1) at an even faster rate of 1C and retains 81.2% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles with a low capacity fade of 0.033% per cycle. Even with a higher loading of 3.05 mg cm(-2), the LSB maintains a capacity of 423 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C after 200 cycles with 98% Coulombic efficiency. Moreover, the flexible current collector opens possibilities for development of flexible and wearable energy storage devices. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One among the significant challenges is the low kinetics. In this work, we design the urchin-like structure of NiCo2O4 to expose more catalytic sites to accelerate the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion. And the oxygen deficient in NiCo2O4 with spinel type structure (space group Fd3m) leads to the excellent chemical affinity of NiCo2O4-x for LiPSs. Moreover, because of the optimal distribution of electron on (311) plane of NiCo2O4-x, the Gibbs free energies of the evolution from S8 to Li2S on (311) plane of NiCo2O4-x is much lower than that of NiCo2O4, illustrating the NiCo2O4-x with the higher catalytic activity. Therefore, the cell with the NiCo2O4-x modified separator exhibits a superior rate performance (632 mAh g+1 at 2.5 C) and a long cycle life (404 mAh g+1 at 1 C after 800 cycles) with excellent Li+ ion diffusion coefficient. The rational structural optimization makes NiCo2O4-x become the efficient catalyst of LSBs. And the results promote the development of bimetallic oxides as catalyst in LSBs.

Here, we show that these defects can be effectively diminished by immobilizing sulfur in porous carbon via the interaction of a small amount of selenium. Amorphous S-rich S1-xSex/C (x <= 0.1) composites have been prepared starting from Se and S powders at 260 degrees C. Raman spectra reveal the existence of S-Se bonds in S1-xSex/C composites. As cathodes for lithium-sulfur batteries, S1-xSex/C (x <= 0.1) composites exhibit high electrochemical performance in a carbonate-based electrolyte. S0.94Se0.06/C composites deliver the best performance with a capacity of 910 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) over 500 cycles, 1105 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1) after 100 cycles and a good rate capability of 617 mA h g(-1) at 20 A g(-1).

However, because of the sharp differences in the redox reaction kinetics and complicated phase transformation of sulfur, a single-component catalyst cannot consistently accelerate the entire redox process. Herein, hierarchical and defect-rich Co3O4/TiO2 p-n junctions (p-Co3O4/n-TiO2-HPs) are fabricated to implement the sequential catalysis of S-8(solid) -> Li2S4(liquid) -> Li2S(solid). Co3O4 sheets physiochemically immobilize the pristine sulfur and ensure the rapid reduction of S-8 to Li2S4, while TiO2 dots realize the effective precipitation of Li2S, bridged by the directional migration of polysulfides from p-type Co3O4 to n-type TiO2 attributed to the interfacial built-in electric field. As a result, the sulfur cathode coupled with p-Co3O4/n-TiO2-HPs delivers long-term cycling stability with a low capacity decay of 0.07% per cycle after 500 cycles at 10 C. This study demonstrates the synergistic effect of the built-in electric field and heterostructures in spatially enhancing the stepwise conversion of polysulfides, which provides novel insights into the interfacial architecture for rationally regulating the polysulfide redox reactions.

Herein, a surface free energy-induced assembly approach is proposed for synthesis of multicavity carbon spheres (MCC). When used as a host for lithium-sulfur cathodes, MCC are fully accessible for sulfur-with high level in-cavity encapsulation ability of grid-like cavities. The crucial point for this assembly approach is the employment of small sized nanoemulsions with high homogeneity as primary building blocks. Spontaneous aggregation and assembly of substructural units are processing in following hydrothermal synthesis induced by reduction of surface free energy of system. As a result, multicavity structure is formed, where the size and number of cavities can be modulated by changing size of nanoemulsion and concentration of polymer. Confined pyrolysis enables to further enlarge cavity size compared to regular pyrolysis. The carbon-sulfur cathode exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate performance, i.e., high capacity of 943 and 869 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at current density of 0.5 and 2.0 C. The strategy has paved the way for custom-ordered synthesis of nanostructured carbon with keen demands in high loading capacity of guest species.

The unique 3DOM structure along with an increased active surface area promotes faster and better electrolyte penetration accelerating ion/mass transfer. Moreover, ZnO as a polar metal oxide has a strong adsorption capacity for polysulfides, which makes the 3DOM ZnO framework an ideal immobilization agent and catalyst to inhibit the polysulfides shuttle effect and promote the redox reactions kinetics. As a result of the stated advantages, the S/3DOM ZnO composite delivered a high initial capacity of 1110 mAh g(-1) and maintained a capacity of 991 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C as a cathode in a lithium-sulfur battery. Even at a high C-rate of 3 C, the S/3DOM ZnO composite still provided a high capacity of 651 mAh g(-1), as well as a high areal capacity (4.47 mAh cm(-2)) under high loading (5 mg cm(-2)).

Here, we propose a new method to prepare g-C3N4 (pCN)/CNTs sulfur host by dissolution-precipitation. Protonated g-C3N4 (pCN) was uniformly dispersed in H2SO4 and electrostatically self-assembled with CNTs. The uniformly dispersed pCN nanosheets provide a strong chemical adsorption capacity for further anchoring LiPS. By adjusting the ratio of pCN/CNTs, it is proved that pCN/CNTs composite with the best ratio of pCN/CNTs at 1:1 (termed as CC1:1) has excellent electrochemical performance, when compared with other pCN/CNTs composites and pristine g-C3N4. After cycling for 500 cycles, the final discharge specific capacity of CC1:1/S cathode is 711.9 mAh g(-1) at 1 C, and each cycle has a low decay rate of 0.08%.

The encapsulation of sulfur in porous nanocarbons is expected to benefit the Li+ migration, yet the e(-) conduction is still to be improved due to a low graphitization degree of a conventional carbon substrate, especially that pyrolyzed from carbohydrates or polymers. Aiming at facilitating the e(-) conduction in the cathode, here we propose to use ketjen black, a highly graphitized nanocarbon building block to form a conductive network for electrons in a biomass-derived, hierarchically porous carbon sponge by a, easily scaled-up approach at a low cost. The specifically designed carbon host ensures a high loading and good retention of active sulfur, while also provides a faster electron transmission to benefit the lithiation/delithiation kinetics of sulfur. The sulfur cathode prepared from the carbon network shows excellent cycling and rate performance in a Li-S battery, rendering its practicality for emerging energy storage opportunities such as grids or automobiles.

However, the practical applications are still hindered by the severe capacity decay, mainly caused by the large volume change, polysulfide shuttle and sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics. Herein, hollow urchin-like Mn3O4 (HU-Mn3O4) microspheres as sulfur hosts have been synthesized by the hydrothermal method and calcination treatment, aiming to prevent the polysulfide dissolution (benefiting from the strong polysulfide anchoring effect of Mn3O4) and alleviate the volume expansion of sulfur (benefiting from the special hollow structure). Meanwhile, the urchin-like thorny surface also facilitates the rapid ion/electron transfer and the abundant active sites for the fast sulfur redox kinetics. When used as the sulfur host in Li-S batteries, the S@HU-Mn3O4 cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1137.4 mAh g(-1) with a slow capacity decay of 0.042% after 200 cycles at 0.2 C. Even under the conditions of lean electrolyte (E/S = 7 mL g(-1)) and low N/P ratio (N/P = 2.1), the S@HU-Mn3O4 cathode still enables a stable cycling performance with a high gravimetric energy density (202 Wh kg cell(-1)), demonstrating its great potential in the development of future practical Li-S battery materials.

A high concentration (68 wt%) of sulfur was successfully immobilized on the surfaces of functionalized CNTs using a unique fabrication method that combined solvent exchange and surface and low-temperature treatments. The developed Li-S cells presented a long cycle life exceeding 1300 cycles and an extremely low capacity decay rate (0.025% per cycle) at 1/3 C rate. Moreover, these Li-S cells had an excellent high-rate response up to 2 C with high Coulombic efficiency (above 95.5%) and high sulfur utilizations (1180 mA h g(-1) of sulfur over 300 cycles at 0.25 C, 799 mA h g(-1) over 600 cycles at 0.75 C, 810 mA h g(-1) over 500 cycles at 1 C, and 400 mA h g(-1) over 500 cycles at 2 C). These results provide important progress towards understanding the role of SCNTs in developing Li-S batteries with potentially high efficiency and long-term service life.

These solvents are commonly employed to dissolve binders used to prepare sulfur cathodes for lithium sulfur batteries. The sulfur electrode fabricated with NMP had a higher discharge capacity and longer cycle life than the ones fabricated with acetonitrile and deionized water. Better adhesion between the current collector and the sulfur electrode accounted for the improved capacity and cycle life of the battery. In addition, the stability of the electrode in the electrolyte was a result of the solubility of sulfur in the solvent. We thus concluded that the solvents used in the fabrication of sulfur electrodes had a positive influence on the electrochemical properties of Li-S batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the design of a three-dimensional core-shell carbon substrate, integrating a porous internal core with a conductive external carbon nanofiber shell. Such a carbon substrate encapsulates a high amount of sulfur as the active material core to form a high-loading core-shell cathode, attaining an ultra-high sulfur loading and content of, respectively, 23 mg cm(-2) and 75 wt%. With distinguishable internal and external regions, the carbon substrate facilitates the redox reactions and hinders the polysulfide diffusion. Thus, the core-shell cathodes exhibit a high areal capacity and energy density of, respectively, 14 mA h cm(-2) and 27 mW h cm(-2) during cycling. During resting, they achieve a long shelf-life of one month with a low capacity-fade rate of 0.25% per day.

Herein, sulfur is copolymerized with 3-butylthiophene via radical polymerization by heating the mixture of both components at controlled temperatures. Further capping of the thus-synthesized copolymer CP(S3BT) with highly conductive PEDOT:PSS thin film substantially enhances the electrical conductivity. With the resulting polymer hybrids as the cathode material, a Li-S battery is constructed which shows an initial discharge capacity of 1362 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C and a reversible capacity of 631 mA h g(-1) even at 5 C. Moreover, the polymer cathode exhibits a high capacity of 682 mA h g-1 after 500 charge-discharge cycles at 1 C with 99.947% retention per cycle. The remarkable performance is attributed to the synergetic effects of (i) high conductivity resulting from both the conducting blocks of poly(3-butylthiophene) (P3BT) and PEDOT:PSS capping layer, (ii) physical confinement of polysulfides by P3BT segments and PEDOT:PSS capping layers, and (iii) chemical confinement resulting from the high density of chemical bonds between sulfur and 3-butylthiophene. The results may offer a new paradigm in the development of efficient and stable polymer cathodes for high performance Li-S batteries.

However, the fast capacity decay resulting from the "shuttle effect" of polysulfide ions and the irregular deposition of the discharge products (Li2S/Li2S2) severely hinder their commercial application. Herein, micro-mesoporous carbone-MnO (MnO/MPC) composites were synthesized with wet impregnation method and applied as the cathode material. In Li-S cells, the MnO/MPC@S cathode showed a rather better cycling stability over 150 cycles than a MPC@S cathode (sulfur loading similar to 74%). The influences of the MnO amount and the heat treatment temperature were investigated and optimized. The 10%-MnO/MPC@S cathode material calcined at 600 degrees C showed excellent rate capability and cycling stability. Owing to the polar MnO nanoparticles, the soluble lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, 2 < n <= 8) can be effectively adsorbed on the host material and the depositing of Li2S and Li2S2 could also be regulated and controlled. Furthermore, compared with the pristine MPC material, the existence of MnO nanoparticle can effectively enhance the reaction kinetics, which could be ascribed to the plenty of polar sites on the surface of MPC material and the electrocatalytic activity of MnO.

Herein, a novel interlayer on the separator was designed and prepared by employing Cr-based compounds (Cr2O3 and Cr3C2), favorable sulfur host materials, as a polysulfide anchor for promoting rate capability and cycling life. Thanks to its specific bonding in the crystal structure, enhanced lithium-ion diffusion dynamics, and better confine function with soluble polysulfides, the Cr3C2 - modified separator exhibits an improved electrochemical performance as compared to the Cr2O3 -modified separator, including a high capacity of 544 mA h g(-1) at 5 C, a good capacity retention ratio of about 53.3%, and excellent cycling stability with a low decay rate of 0.063% per cycle at 3 C. It is believed that the positive outcomes will shed light on carbide as a potential competitor for adsorbing polysulfides, as well as supply a facile and effective avenue for expediting practical applications of Li-S batteries.

A delicate design of hydrangea-like MnO2 grown on the surface of hollow carbon nanospheres can enhance the anchoring and catalytic transformation of Li2Sn (4 <= n <= 8) due to the hybrid architecture, in which the inner hollow architecture can buffer the volume changes during lithiation process and the outer hydrangea-like MnO2 can provide a physical barrier and chemical catalytic channels for electron/ion transfer to restrain the shuttle effect. Consequently, the MnO2-HC-S cathode achieves a high initial specific capacity of 899 mAh(-1) at 0.2 C with S loading of 1.8 mg cm(-2). Such MnO2-HC-S electrode also delivers an ultralow specific capacity loss of 0.039% per cycle at 0.5 C after 1000 cycles. This hybrid cathode combining the polar metal compounds with the nonpolar nano material can provide a special architecture to boost the anchoring of sulfur on the electrode and also propose a simple method for future commercialization of high-performance Li-S batteries.

The issues of lithium polysulfides dissolution and shuttle effect are inhibited distinctly, and significant improvements not only in the active material utilization but also in capacity retention are observed. What's more, the improvement mechanism is studied in detail. The results demonstrate that the sulfur and polysulfide species in separator and electrolyte for the cell with GO-coating separator are much less than that with the pristine separator. The GO membrane still maintains three-dimensional porous and flexible structure with a few lithium polysulfides and Li2S2/Li2S nanoparticles anchored on the surface and inter-layers of GO sheets after long cycles. And the active materials are significantly localized within the cathode structure after GO-coating. In addition, less sulfate species, lithium salts, polysulfides and other insoluble species are identified on the cathode and separator after long-term cycling. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, in this work, cathode material embedded with bipolar metals Ti and Co prepared by a facile self-assembly process using hollow carbon nanospheres (HCSs), MXene nanosheets, and CoO(OH) has been reported. Due to the strong chemical adsorption and high catalytic activity introduced by the bipolar metal related active sites, the Li-S battery with the HCS@Co-MXene/S cathode shows the lowest charge transfer resistance and the best rate capability compared with HCS/S and HCS@MXene/S cathodes. Moreover, the battery delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1309 mA h g-1, which maintains at 570 mA h g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. Even at an elevated discharge current of 1 C, the battery retains a reversible capacity of 728 mA h g-1 over 120 cycles. Therefore, with the embedding of bipolar metals, the current Li-S battery cathode demonstrates superior cycling stability than the reference cathodes. The findings in this work exhibit a promising prospect for facile assembling of the high-performance Li-S battery cathode and the resultant device.

Herein, we synthesized mesocellular carbon foam (MSUF-C) with bimodal mesopore (4 and 30 nm) and large pore volume (1.72 cm(2)/g) using MSUF silica as a template and employed it as both the sulfur reservoir and the conductive agent in the sulfur cathode. Sulfur was uniformly infiltrated into MSUF-C pores by a chemical solution deposition method (MSUF-C/S CSD) and the amount of sulfur loading was achieved as high as 73% thanks to the large pore volume with the CSD approach. MSUF-C/S CSD showed a high capacity (889 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 0.2 C), an improved rate capability (879 mAh/g at 1C and 420 mAh/g at 2C), and a good capacity retention with a fade rate of 0.16% per cycle over 100 cycles.

Herein, we explore 1T MoS(2)nanodots as powerful electrocatalyst to overcome this issue. Electrochemical and synchrotronin situX-ray diffraction characterizations revealed that 1T MoS(2)nanodots with numerous active sites are favored to trap and propel the redox reactions for polysulfides. First-principle calculations indicated that the surface and Mo-terminated edges of 1T MoS(2)provide stronger anchor sites for Li2S, a lower Li-S decomposition barrier, and faster Li ion migration than those for the 2H phase, which suggest the unique catalytic property for edge-rich 1T MoS(2)nanodots in LSBs. In the presence of a small amount of 1T MoS(2)nanodots, porous carbon/Li(2)S(6)cathodes exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance retaining a capacity of 9.3 mA h cm(-2)over 300 cycles under high sulfur loading of 12.9 mg cm(-2)and a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 4.6 mu L mg(-1), which rivals the performance of the state-of-the-art LSBs. Our combined experimental and theoretical analyses rationalized the use of nanodot catalysts in high energy rechargeable batteries.

Here, a group of scaled-up covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) were explored under relatively mild reaction conditions to reduce reaction related interactions. Triazine shows good chemical compatibility with lithium polysulfide though its pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen groups, while hierarchical microporous structures interact physically as a blocking layer. Moreover, the dual chemical/physical functional CTFs act as an ionic sieves owing to their two-dimensional microporous structures that selectively sieve desired lithium ions, while effectively inhibiting soluble polysulfides reaching the lithium anode. As a result, the CTFs coated on commercial separator enhance battery performance, through improved active material utilization, high reversible specific capacity (1249 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C), an ideal rate performance of 802 mA h g(-1) at 2 C, good cycling stability with a low capacity fade-rate of 0.052% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C, good anti-self-discharge behaviour and enhanced protection of the lithium anode.

Both methods include intimate mixing of either carbon black or multiwalled carbon nanotubes with elemental sulfur, molten according to the first approach while dispersed in alcohol and heated according to the second one. Nano- and micro-scale X-ray computed tomography supported by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy shows materials consisting of crystalline sulfur clusters (70 wt%) with size ranging from about 5 to 50 mu m, surrounded by carbon. The sulfur cluster size appears limited by direct mixing of molten sulfur and carbons, in particular when carbon black is employed, whilst it is increased by exploiting the alcohol dispersion. Electrochemistry reveals that small sulfur particles lead to an improved rate capability in Li-S cells, whereas large active material domains may favor the capacity retention. The composites using carbon black nanoparticles exhibit the highest reversible capacity, with a maximum value exceeding 1500 mAh gs(-1), whereas the composites involving multiwalled carbon nanotubes show the best capacity retention, with values approaching 70% over 150 cycles. Our multi-disciplinary approach will shed light on significant aspects aiming to enhance the Li-S battery and favor a practical application.	[Di Lecce, Daniele; Du, Wenjia; Brett, Dan J.

The prepared C-CoSe spheres comprise of spherical nano-aggregates as hollow core and N-doped carbon shell. Kinetics experiments and theoretical calculation as well as in situ Raman spectra reveal that the C-CoSe hollow core-shell spheres can effectively immobilize the LiPSs intermediates by chemical adsorption and physical confinement, and meanwhile accelerate conversion kinetics of the LiPSs owing to strong catalytic effect and superior electron conductivity during electrochemical reaction, thereby the shuttle effect being effectively inhibited. In addition, as a sulfur host, sufficient sulfur storage space related to hierarchical porous structure enable effective accommodation of volume change and full efficacy with sulfur loading of 73%. Benefiting from above advantages, the C-CoSe sulfur cathode exhibits impressive rate performance and excellent cycle stability.

However, the low conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetic of sulfur cathode limit its commercialization. The use of carbon additives can improve the electrical conductivity but accelerates the decomposition of SSEs. Herein, a highly conductive carbon fiber decorated with hybrid 1T/2H MoS2 nanosheets is designed. The high chemical and electrochemical compatibility among MoS2 and sulfide SSE can greatly improve the stability of the cathode and therefore maintain pristine interfaces. The uniform distribution of electrical-conductive metallic 1T MoS2 on carbon fiber benefits the electron transfer between carbon and sulfur. Meanwhile, the layered structure of MoS2 can be intercalated by a large amount of Li ions facilitating ionic and electronic conductivity. In consequence, the charge transfer and reaction kinetics are greatly enhanced, and the decomposition of SSEs is successfully relieved. As a result, the ASSLSB delivers an ultrahigh initial discharge and charge capacity of 1456 and 1470 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C individually with ultrahigh coulombic efficiency and maintains high capacity retention of 78% after 220 cycles. The batteries also obtain a remarkable rate performance of 1069 mAh g(-1) at 1 C.

The experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate that Sr doping results in valence variation in Co along with oxygen vacancy; The Co ions with mixed valence have strong adsorption to the polysulfide ions while the existence of oxygen vacancy enhances the binding strength between Li2S4 and LSC. Based on LSC, a dual coxial LSC/S@C nanocable is successfully designed and fabricated. With a sulfur loading of 2.1 mg cm(-2), the LSC/S@C cathodes demonstrate a high reversible capacity of 996 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 degrees C and an outstanding cycle stability with only 0.039% capacity fade per cycle over 400 cycles. Even with a high sulfur loading of 5.4 mg cm(-2), the LSC/S@C cathode can still deliver similar sulfur utilization and excellent cycling stability. The excellent cycle stability benefits from the chemical interaction between LSC and polysulfides, and the physical entrapment of the carbon shell. Moreover, the highly conductive LSC@C host and the porous interconnected fiber web-like architecture facilitate the mass transfer during charge/discharge process synchronously.

They perform differently in Li-ion and Li-S batteries. It is worth noting that CNTs and graphene are not appropriate to be used as electroactive materials for Li-ion or Li-S batteries for four reasons. First, when CNTs and graphene are used as an anode, they often exhibit high specific capacities during the first lithiation step, but a large fraction of lithium ions is irreversibly consumed instead of reversibly stored, leading to a low Coulombic efficiency of the cell. Second, a graphene-based anode has a large voltage hysteresis in the charge/ discharge curves. Third, it has been reported a CNT-based anode lacks a steady voltage plateau with large change in voltage during discharge. Fourth, despite their high initial capacities, graphene and CNT-based anodes often suffer from fast capacity decay after a few tens of cycles. Continuous efforts have been made to build better lithium batteries with a higher energy density and wider applicability, including both current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries and near-term Li-S batteries. Because the behavior of a rechargeable battery is mainly based on the performance of its anode and cathode, designing advanced electrode materials as well as electrode with tailored compositions and structures has been the hot topic in recent years. The role of carbon nano-materials to construct electrode materials and tailored electrodes in Li-ion and Li-S batteries in high performance was reviewed in the paper from three aspects. Firstly, the role of carbon nano-materials in modifying the electroactive materials was discussed from three aspects: electron- and ion-transport facilitators, immobilization sites and volume expansion buffering. Secondly, the role of carbon nano-materials in optimizing the inactive components was considered as follows: conducting additives, current collectors and conductive interlayers. Thirdly, the role of carbon nano-materials in designing the bendable and stretchable devices are discussed from three aspects: conductive phases in nonconductive substrates, flexible current collectors and freestanding composite electrode. Finally, perspectives on future development of Li-ion and Li-S batteries were presented. It is considered that multi-functional carbon nano-materials will be main research focus in the future.

However, due to the drawback of soluble Li2Sn (4 <= n <= 8) intermediates, the generated poor electrochemical reversibility and low coulombic efficiency limit the commercial applications of these batteries. Herein, we have proposed a prospective approach to promote the comprehensive electrochemical property of Li-S batteries utilizing a Ni nanoparticles/nitrogen doped carbon/Ketjen Black (Ni/NC/KB) composite derived from Ni-based MOFs as a separator coating. When current density is at 1C, the Ni/NC/KB separator exhibited a high capacity of 653.7 mA h g(-1) with an inappreciable capacity fading of around 0.07% per cycle over 500 cycles. The performance improvement is attributed to the nature, morphology and structure of the as-prepared porous composite material, which restricted the polysulfides in the cathode area and catalyzed the long-chain polysulfides to the short-chain polysulfides. These results bring out the possibility of utilizing composite materials such as Ni/NC/KB as separator coating for high-performance Li-S batteries, hence addressing the limitations on further development into these battery systems.

However, it remains great challenges in achieving fast electron and ion conduction while accommodating the dramatic volume change and suppressing severe intermediate polysulfide dissolution under practically necessary '3H' conditions (high areal sulfur loading, high electrode compactness and high sulfur content). Here a compact 3D interconnected sulfur cathode is reported to satisfy the above requirements. It is constructed by self-assembly of Zn, Co-bimetallic ZIF nanoparticles, following pyrolysis and subsequent melt-diffusion of high-content sulfur. Sulfur filled into an open porous 3D carbon network (3DCN) with abundant N, Co doping and graphitic carbon species and produced a thin sulfur-coating layer on the macroporous surface of 3DCN. Such smart architecture provides multidimensional electron and ion transport pathways and shortened mass and ion diffusion length. The close contact of sulfur species with carbon-based polar host provides facilitated physiochemical adsorption and conversion reaction of polysulfides. At high areal sulfur loading of 10.9 mg cm(-2), high sulfur content of 74 wt% in the whole cathode and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6 mu L/mg, it delivers high gravimetric/volumetric/areal capacities of 945 mA h g(-1)/867 mA h cm(-3)/10.3 mA h cm(-2) at 0.1 C (1.83 mA cm(-2)). At a high rate of 0.5 C (9.13 mA cm(-2)), it still presents a high capacity of 8.73 mA h cm(-2) and maintains 6.35 mA h cm(-2) after 200 cycles. Therefore this work provides an instructive paradigm of rational architecture design to fabricate sulfur cathodes for practically viable Li-S batteries.

It is found that Sep/CNT/S@ PANI composites possess high initial discharge capacity, good cyclic stability and good rate performance. The initial discharge capacity of the Sep/CNT/S@ PANI-II composite is about 1100 mA h g(-1) at 2C, and remained at 650 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles, and the corresponding coulombic efficiency is above 93%. Such performance is attributed to specific porous structure, outstanding adsorption characteristics, and excellent ion exchange capability of sepiolite, as well as excellent conductivity of CNT. Furthermore, the PANI coating has a pinning effect for sulfur, which enhances the utilization of the active mass and improves the cycling stability and the coulombic efficiency of the composites at high current rates.

The PSN framework is formed at the surface of the oxidized carbon black by conductive polymer self-assembly and grafting, followed by pouring elemental sulfur into the pores of the polymer matrix. As the cathode material for lithium-sulfur batteries, the C-S@PANI composite delivered a high specific capacity of 1453 mA h g(-1) at a 0.1 C current rate and a stable cycling performance of 948 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles. The composite also demonstrated high capacities of 922 and 581 mA h g(-1) at 50 degrees C and 0 degrees C, respectively, after 200 cycles. The conductive PANI coatings were connected with the C-S core-shell composites to form a three-dimensional conducting network, which improves the utilization of the active mass and dual conduction of Li+ and electrons, while at the same time encapsulating sulfur into the PANI hollow spherical network. The structure effectively inhibits the dissolution and migration of polysulfides into the electrolyte, while improving the cycling stability and the coulombic efficiency of the electrode at high current rates, especially the low temperature electrochemical properties of Li-S batteries.

Key Parameters Governing the Energy Density of Rechargeable Li/S Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; POROUS CARBON; CATHODE; CHALLENGES; COMPOSITES	Rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries have high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, their volumetric energy density has been believed to be lower than that of conventional lithium ion batteries employing metal oxide cathodes like LiCoO2. Here, we study the effects of sulfur loading percentage, develop a simple model and calculate the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities based on the total composition of electrodes in a lithium-sulfur cell, and compare those results with a typical graphite/LiCoO2 cell. From the model output, we have identified and established key parameters governing the energy density of rechargeable Li/S batteries. We find that the sulfur loading percentage has a much higher impact on the volumetric energy density than on the gravirnetric energy density. A lithium-sulfur cell can exceed a lithium ion cell's volumetric energy density but only at high sulfur loading percentages (ca. 70%). We believe that these findings may attract more attention of lithium-sulfur system studies to high sulfur loading levels.

The sulfur-HCNS composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetry (TG) measurements. It is found that the elemental sulfur was dispersed inside the pores of carbon spheres. It is demonstrated from the galvanostatic discharge-charge process and cyclic voltammetry (CV) that the sulfur-HCNS composite has a large reversible capacity and an excellent cycling performance as cathode materials. The sulfur-HCNS composite with a sulfur content of 47.6 wt% displays an initial discharge capacity of 1031 mA h g(-1) and a reversible discharge capacity of 477 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.5 C charge-discharge rate.

Remarkably, the capacity of the NCOHF/S composite electrode was similar to 666.8 mA h g(-1) in the fourth cycle, which was maintained at similar to 432.9 mA h g(-1) in the 400th cycle under a current density of 1.0C, with a low decay rate of 0.087% per cycle. The overall outstanding properties of the NCOHF/S composite are attributed to the successful new strategy in structural design via in situ and ex situ procedures. Firstly, NCOHF with bifunctional catalytic activity and chemical adsorption can efficiently promote the redox reactions of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and suppress the diffusion of polysulfides. Secondly, NCOHF with inherently high electronic conductivity acts as a conduit to accelerate the transport of electrons and ions. Thirdly, the flower-like NiCo2O4 nanosheets are anchored tightly to the conductive carbon and binder during the Li+ insertion and extraction processes, which can effectively suppress the aggregation of the NCOHF/S composite during cycling. Finally, the hollow space inside the NCOHF/S composite provides sufficient free space for the expansion of encapsulated pure sulfur.

Rational design and facile scalable synthesis of CNS with high SSA, low cost and ultrathin nanosheet structure is highly desired but hitherto remains a big challenge. Here, we report a novel synthesis method of 2D hierarchical porous CNS with ultrahigh SSA (2687 m(2) g(-1)) and ultrathin structure by directly pyrolysing and activating a unique and abundant biomass sheet. The electrochemical characterisations show that the prepared CNS-4-1 materials as electrodes creates a good energy-storage capability, with the energy density being 91 Wh kg(-1) for symmetric SCs in ionic liquids, which is the highest in the reported biomass-derived CNS materials for SCs applications so far. Besides, the CNS-5-1 also exhibits a high initial capacity of 1078 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C when it acted as a sulfur hosting material for lithium-sulfur batteries. More importantly, it also shows a 586 mAh g(-1) reversible capacity and an approaching 100% coulombic efficiency after 500 cycles at a high rate of 1 C. These superior electrochemical properties of the CNS are mainly attributed to their unique 2D ultrathin nanosheet structure, large SSA, and reasonable hierarchical porous structure. This work not only provides a new strategy to fabricate the ultrathin CNS in large scale and low cost but also enlarges CNS materials potential applications in energy storage. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the shuttle effect of the soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and intrinsic insulating nature of sulfur lead to low sulfur utilization and coulombic efficiency, leading to poor cycling performance. The impeded charge transportation and retard LiPS catalytic conversion also endows the Li-S batteries with sluggish redox reaction, leading to unsatisfied rate capability. In this study, Co-based MOF material ZIF-67 is used as the precursor to prepare Co nano-dots decorated three-dimensional graphene aerogel as sulfur immobilizer. This porous architecture establishes a highly conductive interconnected framework for fast charge/mass transportation. The exposed Co nano-dots serve as active sites to strongly trap LiPS, which endows CoNDs@G with low decomposition energy barrier for fast LiPS conversion reaction and promote the completely Li2S catalytic transformation. Li-S cells based on the Co-NDs@G cathode exhibits excellent cyclability and a high capacity retention rate of 91.1% in 100 cycles. This strategy offers a new direction to design sulfur immobilizer for accelerated LiPS conversion kinetics of Li-S batteries.

However, the shuttle effect and sluggish reduction reaction kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) seriously affect the performance of the batteries. Here, we report GO-d-Ti3C2Tx MXene aerogels with a novel three-dimensional (3D) reticular structure that served as sulfur host cathode materials for lithium-sulfur batteries (LiSBs), which benefits adsorption/catalytic conversion of LiPSs simultaneously. The dissolved LiPSs can be rapidly captured through chemisorption and then catalyzed into insoluble Li2S by low-coordinated-state Ti on the d-Ti3C2Tx MXene surface. The combination of adsorption and catalysis enormously improves the capacity and cycling performance of LiSBs. At an S mass loading of 1.5 mg cm(-2), the cell with the S@GM0.4 composite electrode achieves excellent cycling performance. The discharge specific capacity of 1039 mA h g(-1) (1.56 mA h cm(-2)) decays to 542.9 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles with a capacity fading rate of 0.048% per cycle at 0.5 C.

This multifunctional carbon not only is a promising anode candidate for long-life lithium-ion batteries but also shows favorable properties as anode and cathode host material owing to a high nitrogen content (>8% after carbonization at 900 degrees C). To demonstrate the latter, the hierarchical carbon was melt-infiltrated with sulfur as well as coated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of anatase TiO2, both of which led to high-quality nanocomposites. TiO2 ALD increased the specific capacity of the carbon while maintaining high Coulombic efficiency and cycle life: the composite exhibited stable performance in lithium half-cells, with excellent recovery of low rate capacities after thousands of cycles at SC. Lithium-sulfur batteries using the sulfur/carbon composite also showed good cyclability, with reversible capacities of similar to 700 mA.h.g(-1) at C/5 and without obvious decay over several hundred cycles. The present results demonstrate that nitrogen-rich carbon with an interconnected multimodal pore structure is very versatile and can be used as both active and inactive electrode material in high-performance lithium-based batteries.

Superficial sulfur on the outside of microporous carbon host can occur"shuttle effect" in ether electrolyte or nucleophilic reaction in carbonate electrolyte, which may affect the electrochemical reaction mechanism for lithium-sulfur batteries and need to be further clarified. Herein, we rationally designed microporous carbon and non-microporous carbon as the sulfur hosts, and manipulated the distribution of sulfur via interfacial control in cathode material, exhibiting diverse electrochemical behavior in carbonate electrolyte and ether electrolyte. The surface composition of the electrode was confirmed by ex-situ XPS and verified by in-situ XRD, which contributes to demonstrating the definite reaction mechanisms of lithium-sulfur batteries in the different electrolytes. The results show only the sulfur confined in microporous structure is active via "solid-solid" pathway, and the presence of sulfur on the outer surface of the cathode electrode has the negative effect on electrochemical performance in both electrolytes, which should be avoided in the fabrication of carbon/sulfur composites. Based on microporous carbon/sulfur composites, the lithiated GeS full cell was proposed and exhibited superior cycling performance and high Coulombic Efficiency.

Critical Link between Materials Chemistry and Cell-Level Design for High Energy Density and Low Cost Lithium-Sulfur Transportation Battery	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							S BATTERIES; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; CARBON NANOFIBERS; ELECTROLYTE; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY; CATHODE; SPECTROSCOPY; STABILITY; LIFE	A materials-to-system analysis for the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) electric vehicle battery is presented that identifies the key electrode and cell design considerations from reports of materials chemistry. The resulting systems-level energy density, specific energy and battery price as a function of these parameters is projected. Excess lithium metal amount at the anode and useable specific capacity, electrolyte volume fraction, sulfur to carbon ratio and reaction kinetics at the cathode are all shown to be critical for the high energy density and low cost requirements. Electrode loading is determined as a key parameter to relate the battery price for useable energy to the investigated design considerations. The presented analysis proposes that electrode loadings higher than 8 mAh/cm(2) (similar to 7 mg S/cm(2)) are necessary for Li-S systems to exhibit the high energy density and low cost required for transportation applications. Stabilizing the interface of lithium metal at the required current densities and areal capacities while simultaneously maintaining cell capacity with high sulfur loading in an electrolyte starved cathode are identified as the key barriers for ongoing research and development efforts to address.

The S/C composites were prepared using three structured carbon materials of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), acetylene black (AB), and graphene nanosheets (GNS). The three-dimensional mesh structure of the S/CNT composite reduced the loss of active material compared to the other S/C composites. In addition, this structure improved the electrochemical properties of the battery because Li+ was more effectively diffused through the pathways established by the mesh. As a result, the S/CNT electrode exhibited superior performance with a high discharge capacity of 1166 mAh g(-1) at the first cycle and 806 mAh g(-1) after 40 cycles, almost 300 mAh g-1 higher than that obtained with the S/AB electrode. Good cycle stability of 94%, based on calculations from 2 to 40 cycles, was observed in the S/CNT electrode. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, this work reports a strong mitigation toward lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) adsorption/catalysis by introducing defective graphite phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as an effective additive. Without significant weight increase, the nitrogen deficient g-C3N4, in the form of ultrafine spindle-like nitrogen deficient g-C3N4-x (sCN), can be easily combined with commercial poly-propylene (PP) separators after hydrophilic modification of polydopamine, which corresponds to an ultralow overall weightiness contribution of 0.17 mg cm(-2). Physical/electrochemical characterizations and theoretical studies reveal that sCN exhibits strong electrostatic attraction with LiPSs by nitrogen defects and new formation of cyano groups near edges, thereby maintaining rapid and reliable Li-S electrochemistry. Of particular importance is the chainmail catalyst design with separators that enable magic polysulfides adsorption effect and desirable thermostability/wettability, which guarantees the sCNPP-assembled cells with long and stable durability over 500 cycles at 5.0 C (capacity fading rate: 0.05% per cycle), and a high capability of 476 mAh g(-1) is obtained.

The hybrid material is synthesized by using ferric chloride as an oxidizing agent and polysulfide as the sulfur source. The oxidizing agent FeCl3 is introduced as a soft film template to form a sulfur film on graphene oxide (GO). This is ascribed to the formation of a ferric cations double layer (FCDL) on the graphene oxide surface with many negative functional groups. Material characterizations reveal that GO is reduced to reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and the sulfur materials are embedded in a three dimensional conducting composite network of RGO and polyethylene glycol (PEG), forming a continuous sulfur film coating on RGO. When fabricated as a cathode material for rechargeable lithium ion batteries, the sulfur film-coated graphene composite electrode exhibits high capacity, improved Coulombic efficiency and extraordinarily stable cycling performance. It is believed that the sulfur film is coated on RGO and protected by the PEG network, and therefore the high solubility of the polysulfide anions formed as the reaction intermediate in the discharge and charge processes is relieved to a large extent. The electronic conductivity of insulating sulfur is also improved substantially in the RGO-S-PEG network.

However, it is still challenging to inhibit the diffusion of polysulfides and achieve high sulfur utilization. Herein, we designed and prepared a free-standing and binder-free electrode for high-performance Li-S batteries by in situ growth of three-dimensional ordered macroporous MoO2 on carbonized nonwoven cloth (3DOM MoO2/CC). After the uptake of Li2S6, the obtained MoO2/CC-Li2S6 electrode with a high sulfur loading of 3.26 mg cm(-2) delivers a large discharge capacity of 1267 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C. A high discharge capacity of 621 mA h g(-1) is still retained after 500 cycles at 2C. The excellent electrochemical performance of this MoO2/CC-Li2S6 electrode is attributed to the unique nanostructure and strong chemical interaction between MoO2 and polysulfides. 3DOM MoO2 not only guarantees the high loading of sulfur but also suppresses the diffusion of polysulfides. The carbonized nonwoven cloth (CC) functions as the basic support for 3DOM MoO2, enhancing the electronic conductivity and mechanical properties of the free-standing electrodes. This work provides a feasible strategy for the construction of high-performance free-standing binder-free Li-S electrodes.

However, the electrical insulativity of sulfur and the serious shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) still impedes its further development. In this regard, a uniform hollow mesoporous Ni(OH)(2)@CNT microsphere was developed to address these issues. The SEM images show the Ni(OH)(2) delivers an average size of about 5 mu m, which is composed of nanosheets. The designed Ni(OH)(2)@CNT contains transition metal cations and interlayer anions, featuring the unique 3D spheroidal flower structure, decent porosity, and large surface area, which is highly conducive to conversion systems and electrochemical energy storage. As a result, the as-fabricated Li-S battery delivers the reversible capacity of 652 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles, demonstrating excellent capacity retention with a low average capacity loss of only 0.081% per cycle at 1 C. This work has shown that the Ni(OH)(2)@CNT sulfur host prepared by hydrothermal embraces delivers strong physical absorption as well as chemical affinity.

J	Zhang, CY; He, Q; Chu, W; Zhao, Y				Zhang, Chengyi; He, Qiu; Chu, Wei; Zhao, Yan			Transition metals doped borophene-graphene heterostructure for robust polysulfide anchoring: A first principle study	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Polysulfide; Lithium-sulfur battery; Borophene; Density functional theory	PROMISING ANODE MATERIAL; LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; 2-DIMENSIONAL BORON; LI-ION; PERFORMANCE; CATHODE; INTERCALATION; STORAGE; OXIDE; HOST	Borophene shows great potential to be applied in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery as an inhibitor of polysulfides shuttling due to its two-dimensional stable structure and high electronic conductivity. In order to evaluate polysulfides anchoring capability of different configurations of borophenes, density functional theory (DFT) has been employed to calculate the adsorption energies of polysulfides on borophenes of different configurations. The DFT results show that the perfect puckered borophene B-0 gives better adsorption performance towards the polysulfides than three defective borophenes (B-1, B-2 and B-3). The DFT calculations also reveal that deformations of borophenes are triggered by the polysulfides adsorption, but the deformation of borophenes can be restrained by forming 2D heterogeneous structure with graphene (B-0/G) without compromising the polysulfide immobilization capability. B-0/G shows the strongest anchoring capability among the B-x/G composites. Furthermore, to strengthen the adsorption of polysulfides on B-0/G, the B-0 layer is doped with different transition metals (Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu), and the adsorption energies increase with the increasing reducibility of the doped transition metal atoms. Ti-doped B-0/G shows the best performance for suppressing the polysulfides shuttle effect. This work demonstrated that the graphene compositing and transitional metal doping have large impacts on the performance of the borophene for polysulfides anchoring.

J	Xu, YG; Ou, XD; Zhang, XW				Xu, Yiguo; Ou, Xuedong; Zhang, Xiuwen			Theoretical Study of Two-Dimensional alpha-Tellurene with Pseudo-Heterospecies as a Promising Elemental Anchoring Material for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article								The main obstacle that impedes the application of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is the severe shuttle effect, which can be overcome by introducing anchoring materials (AMs) to immobilize soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) without decomposing them. The number of decomposition pathways could be significantly reduced in AMs with a minimum number of species such as graphene which, however, is homoatomic and nonpolar with low affinity to LiPSs. In this study, we investigate the anchoring behavior of another two-dimensional elemental material alpha-tellurene that is chemically analogous to the 1T transition-metal dichalcogenides, in the framework of density functional theory. We demonstrate that the atellurene with pseudo-heterospecies (with positively charged central Te and negatively charged outer layer Te) exhibits an outstanding anchoring performance due to the suitable binding strength of LiPSs in the range of 0.86-2.39 eV, which effectively suppress the shuttle effect but do not cause the decomposition of LiPSs. The moderate binding strength is attributed to the pseudo-heterospecies as well as to the competition between S and Te for capturing electrons from Li. Furthermore, the low Li atom diffusion (0.18 eV) and Li2S catalytic decomposition (0.88 eV) energy barriers guarantee the fast electrochemical process of alpha-tellurene-integrated Li-S batteries. Given these advantages, it is expected that alpha-tellurene is a promising AM for Li-S batteries.

In the positive composite electrode, P2S5 without ionic conductivity was transformed into a solid electrolyte with ionic conductivity by incorporating lithium ions into P2S5 during the first charge-discharge cycle. Therefore, the all-solid-state Li-S cell with P2S5-based positive composite electrode behaved as a secondary battery. This positive composite electrode is very low cost because it did not use an expensive solid electrolyte. In addition to using a cost-effective positive composite electrode with a sulfur content of 60 wt%, the all-solid-state Li-S cell exhibited an extremely high capacity of 1042 mAhg(-1) under 6.4 mAcm(-2) at 25 degrees C.

However, they undergo rapid capacity fading after the initial cycles due to the dissolution of polysulfides which further results in the shuttle effect. To address this issue and to protect the Li anode surface, silicon suboxide decorated stabilized polyacrylonitrile (sPAN-SiOx) fibermats are used as a freestanding interlayer on the cathode side. Polysulfides are easily captured at the cathode side with the help of the complementary adsorption effect of oxygen-containing functional groups, SiOx and the pyridinic-N structure of sPAN-SiOx resulting in better electrochemical cell performance. The adsorption effect of those functional groups and SiOx is confirmed by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis as obvious shifts in the binding energies and reductions of the peak intensities in the presence of polysulfides. The battery cell with the sPAN-SiOx interlayer shows a discharge capacity of 646 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles of charge-discharge at C/5 current density which is a significant increase compared to the cells with a stabilized polyacrylonitrile (sPAN) interlayer or the cells without an interlayer.
