Dynamic and Structural Properties of Room-Temperature Ionic Liquids near Silica and Carbon Surfaces	LANGMUIR			English	Article							ELECTRICAL DOUBLE-LAYERS; MELTING-POINT; DIFFUSION; ELECTROLYTES; CAPACITANCE; VISCOSITY; SOLVENTS; PARTICLE; IMPACT; FORCES	The dynamic and structural properties of a room. temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium-(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) ([C(4)mim][Tf2N]) confined in silica and carbon mesopores were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. The complex interfacial microstructures of confined [C(4)mim] [Tf2N] are attributed to the distinctive surface features of the silica mesopore. The temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients of [C(4)mim][Tf2N] confined in the silica or carbon mesopore exhibit divergent behavior. The loading fraction (f = 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25) has a large effect on the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient in the silica pore and displays weaker temperature dependence as the loading fraction decreases. The diffusion coefficients of mesoporous carbon-confined [C(4)mim][Tf2N] are relatively insensitive to the loading faction and exhibit a temperature dependence that is similar to the bulk dependence at all loading levels. Such phenomena can be attributed to the unique surface heterogeneity, dissimilar interfacial microstructures, and interaction potential profile of RTILs near silica and carbon walls.

In efforts to improve understanding of plants' responses to associated stresses, we have investigated responses of mosses to drought under elevated nitrogen conditions. More specifically, we exposed Pogonatum cirratum subsp. fuscatum and Hypnum plumaeforme to various nitrate (KNO3) or ammonium (NH4Cl) treatments, with and without water deficit stress and monitored indices related to carbon (C) and N metabolism both immediately after the stress and after a short recovery period. The results show that N application stimulated both C and N assimilation activities, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase (GS/GOGAT), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activities, while water deficit inhibited C and N assimilation. The mosses could resist stress caused by excess N and water deficit by increasing their photorespiration activity and proline (Pro) contents. However, N supply increased their sensitivity to water stress, causing sharper reductions in C and N assimilation rates, and further increases in photorespiration and Pro contents, indicating more serious oxidative or osmotic stress in the mosses. In addition, there were interspecific differences in N assimilation pathways, as the GS/GOGAT and GDH pathways were the preferentially used ammonium assimilation pathways in P.cirratum and H.plumaeforme when stressed, respectively. After rehydration, both mosses exhibited overcompensation effects for most C and N assimilation activities, but when supplied with N, the activities were generally restored to previous levels (or less), indicating that N supply reduced their ability to recover from water deficit stress. In conclusion, mosses can tolerate a certain degree of water deficit stress and possess some resilience to environmental fluctuations, but elevated N deposition reduces their tolerance and ability to recover.

In this research, through in situ electrical resistance measurements, we studied the electrical conductance changes of carbon nanotube networks (NTNs) in various BP samples from complete immersion to evaporation using different chemical solvents. BP samples demonstrated a 20-30% decrease in conductance upon the immersion and almost full recovery after the drying process. We found that by pre-stressing, BP samples demonstrated highly reproducible patterns of conductance changes corresponding to solvent quantity. This feature can be potentially used for sensor applications to simultaneously detect both the occurrence and the amount of organic solvent leakage.

The addition of DCDA molecules could produce nitrogen-doped carbon species with predominant pyrrolic nitrogen atoms on the SiO2 support. The nitrogen-doped carbon species formed not only improved the reduction of Co3O4 particles, but also facilitated the electron transfer from the pyrrolic nitrogen atoms to neighboring metallic Co-0 particles during reduction on the Co/SiO2-CN catalyst, in contrast to the conventional impregnation derived Co/SiO2-IWI sample. Such an effect ameliorated the electron-deficient state of metallic Co-0 particles that existed on the Co/SiO2-IWI catalyst and was favorable to CO dissociation. As a result, the DCDA-additive method derived Co/SiO2 shows a higher turnover frequency value than the conventional Co/SiO2-IWI catalyst in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction.

The experimental results were compared with those of a control DMBR to investigate the filtration performance and various properties of the dynamic membrane (DM) layer. One flat-sheet DM module made of nylon mesh (pore size 75 mu m) was used for effluent production at a high stable flux (50-100 L/m(2) h) under a 10 cm water head by gravity flow, resulting in continuous operation cycles of 60-120 h. During the operation period, the PAC-DMBR showed enhanced removal efficiency of pollutants, higher stable membrane flux (10 L/m2 h more), lower filtration resistance (6.0-8.0 x 10(10) m(-1)), quicker formation of the DM layer (within 5 min), and better DM layer regeneration after air backwashing. The DM layer in the PAC-DMBR showed a more porous and incompressible structure, because less extracellular polymeric substance and a portion of the biological PAC were incorporated into the DM layer formed as verified by the analytical results. Using high-throughput pyrosequencing technology, it was revealed that at the genus level the diversity of bacterial communities increased from 18 to 23 genera, while several genera that were favored in the PAC-assisted environment or were responsible for degrading complex organics were enriched. Moreover, the abundance of phylum Proteobacteria, which served as pioneer surface colonizers, was reduced in the PAC-DMBR. It was concluded that PAC addition could modify various aspects of the activated sludge and the DM layer properties, which affected the filtration behavior of the DM layer in the PAC-DMBR.

Regional scalable priorities for national biodiversity and carbon conservation planning in Asia	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							PROTECTED AREAS; DEFORESTATION; CONVENTION; EMISSIONS; DIVERSITY; DRIVERS; FORESTS	To achieve the goals of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, we must identify representative targets that effectively protect biodiversity and can be implemented at a national level. We developed a framework to identify synergies between biodiversity and carbon across the Asian region and proposed a stepwise approach based on scalable priorities at regional, biome, and national levels that can complement potential Convention on Biological Diversity targets of protecting 30% land in the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Our targets show that 30% of Asian land could effectively protect over 70% of all assessed species relative to only 11% now (based on analysis of 8932 terrestrial vertebrates), in addition to 2.3 to 3.6 hundred billion metric tons of carbon. Funding mechanisms are needed to ensure such targets to support biodiversity-carbon mutually beneficial solutions at the national level while reflecting broader priorities, especially in hyperdiverse countries where priorities exceed 30% of land.

However, the conventional urea production relies on energy-intensive processes, consuming approximately 2% of annual global energy. Here, we report on a more-sustainable electrocatalytic approach that allows for direct and selective synthesis of urea from nitrate and carbon dioxide with an indium hydroxide catalyst at ambient conditions. Remarkably, Faradaic efficiency, nitrogen selectivity and carbon selectivity reach 53.4%, 82.9% and similar to 100%, respectively. The engineered surface semiconducting behaviour of the catalyst is found to suppress hydrogen evolution reaction. The key step of C-N coupling initiates through the reaction between *NO2 and *CO2 intermediates owing to the low energy barrier on {100} facets. This work suggests an appealing route of urea production and provides deep insight into the underlying chemistry of C-N coupling reaction that could guide sustainable synthesis of other indispensable chemicals.

Here we introduce an advanced semi-liquid battery of lithium-polysulfide-eight (PS8) catholyte system in which ions act as active material with a high theoretical capacity due to 14 electron exchange between anode and cathode. A 1.6-2.35 V charge-discharge potential window is selected purposely to avoid the solid sulfur formation, ensuring ultra-long cycling stability and a high inner conductivity. This lithium PS8 (0.5 M) catholyte system delivers a high capacity of 1302 mAh g(-1) (2600 +/- 18 Wh kg(-1) or 333 +/- 2 Wh L-1) at 0.2 C, and excellent rate capacity and cycling stability of 1020 +/- 21 mA h g(-1) (2040 +/- 42 Wh kg(-1) or 261 +/- 5 Wh L-1) at 5 C. The performance of the PS8 batteries is superior to the Li-S batteries and other reported catholyte systems. The obtained outstanding electrochemical performance consents the system to be considered as a promising candidate for large-scale electrical energy storage in the future.

We find that neither the pristine graphane sheet nor the sheet defected by removing a few surface H atoms have sufficient affinity for either H2S or NH3 gas molecules. However, a graphane sheet doped with Li adatoms shows a strong sensing affinity for both the mentioned gas molecules. We have calculated the absorption energies with one [referred to as half coverage] molecule and two molecules [referred to as full coverage] for both gases with the Li-doped graphane sheet. We find that for both the gases, the calculated absorption energies are adequate enough to decide that the Li-doped graphane sheet is suitable for sensing H2S and NH3 gases. The Li-doped sheet shows a higher affinity for the NH3 gas compared to the H2S gas molecules due to a stronger Li(s)-N(p) hybridization compared to that of Li(s)-S(p). However, while going from the half coverage effect to the full coverage effect, the calculated binding energies show a decreasing trend for both the gases. The calculated work function of the Li-doped graphane sheet decreases while bringing the gas molecules within its vicinity, which explains the affinity of the sheet towards both the gas molecules.

However, the traditional sizing agent is not suitable for processing continuous CF reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPs) with high processing temperature. In this work, polyetherimide (PEI) is chosen as the sizing agent for CF reinforced polyetheretherketone (CF/PEEK) composites, and the sizing content as well as the type of sizing agent (including solvent-based and emulsion type) were systematically researched. After a series of characterization of CF surface properties and interfacial strength of CF/PEEK, the improvement of interfacial shear strength (IFSS) and mechanical performances of sized CF/PEEK proves the enhancement of interfacial adhesion after sizing. CF/PEEK composites which contain CF handled by emulsion type sizing agent have good mechanical properties, indicating that it has the potential to replace solvent-based sizing agent. Besides, the miscible feature of PEEK with PEI, the raise of CF surface roughness and surface energy might cause the reinforcement of interfacial mechanical properties. This research may create a potential way for CF production field, aiming at improving the interfacial performance of CFRTPs.

The tensile and bending properties of LW-EGC were studied using a uniaxial tensile test and four-point bending test. The relationship between ultimate tensile strain and mid-span displacement was discussed. The crystal composition and chemical bond of raw materials and LW-EGC were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and the micro-morphology was analyzed via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The test results showed the following: (1) When 10% mass fraction of FAC was added, LW-EGC-10% had a compressive strength of 33.7 MPa, a density of 1522 kg/m(3), a flowability of 255 mm, and a tensile strain capacity of 6.03%. (2) The crack width of LW-EGC was generally less than 90 mu m, and the crack spacing was generally less than 2 mm with the introduction of FAC, which indicates excellent crack control ability. (3) The XRD spectra indicated that the production of new crystal images was not significant in the geopolymerization, and the FT-IR spectra showed that the reaction products were mainly new aluminosilicate phases. (4) During the extraction of MWCNT and PVA fibers, large extrusion deformation occurred, leaving a large number of broken matrix and FAC fragments on the fiber surface, which made the LW-EGC have excellent tensile strain capacity. The results show that FAC is a promising material for the production of ductility and lightweight structural components with potential for correct processing and efficient recovery of FAC.

First-principles study of Pd-decorated carbon nanotube for hydrogen storage	CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							ENERGY; ADSORPTION; CAPACITY; METALS	Based on first-principles plane wave calculations, we investigated the hydrogen adsorption on Pd-decorated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Our calculations revealed that the most hydrogen storage capacity is 2.88 wt.% with an average binding energy 292 meV for the uniformly Pd-decorated SWCNT, which is in good agreement with the experimental measurement. The electrostatic Coulomb attraction and the orbital repulsion mediate the interaction between H-2 and Pd. Our results predicted the binding energy and the hydrogen storage capacity can be further enhanced by using the open-shell transition metal/SWCNT media. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Transforming bulk C2N into zerodimensional quantum dots (QDs) could induce unique quantum confinement and edge effects that produce improved or new properties. Despite their appealing potential, C(2)NQDs remain unexplored, and their intriguing properties and a fundamental understanding of their prominent edge effects are still not well understood. Here, we report the first synthesis of water-soluble C(2)NQDs via a top-down approach without any foreign stabilizer and exploit their linear/nonlinear optical properties and unique edge-preferential electrocatalytic activity toward polysulfides for versatile applications. The resultant dispersant-free C(2)NQDs with an average size of less than 5 nm feature rich oxygen-carrying groups and active edges, not only enabling excellent dispersion in water but also creating interesting multifunctionality. They can emit not only blue one-photon luminescence (OPL) under ultraviolet (UV) excitation but also green two-photon luminescence (TPL) with a wide near-infrared (NIR) excitation range of 750-900 nm, enabling their use as a new fluorescent ink. Interestingly, when C(2)NQDs are introduced to modify commercial separators, they can function as new metal-free catalysts to boost polysulfide redox kinetics and endow Li-S batteries with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability, and large areal capacity (7.0 mA h cm(-2)) at a high sulfur loading of 8.0 mg cm(-2). Detailed theoretical and experimental results indicate that the edge of C2N is more favorable for trapping and catalyzing the polysulfide conversion than the terrace and that the synergy between the active edges and oxygenated groups enriched in C(2)NQDs remarkably improves polysulfide immobilization and catalytic conversion.

FeOOH nanoparticles were first grown uniformly onto the surface of the titania thin-layer precoated cellulose nanofibers, and thereafter, the as-prepared FeOOH-TiO2-cellulose composite was calcined and carbonized in argon atmosphere at 500 degrees C for 6 h to produce the Fe3O4-TiO2-carbon composite. The resultant composite possesses a hierarchical structure that was faithfully inherited from the initial cellulose substance, which was composed of titania-coated carbon fibers with corncob-like shaped Fe3O4 nanoparticles immobilized on the surfaces. The diameter of the composite nanofiber is ca. 100-200 nm, and the diameter of the Fe3O4 nanoparticle is about 30 nm, which is coated with an ultrathin carbon layer with a thickness about 3 nm. This composite displayed superior lithium-ion storage performance. It showed a first-cycle discharge capacity of 1340 mAh/g, delivering a stable reversible capacity of ca. 525 mAh/g after 100 charge discharge cycles at a current density of 100 mA/g, and the efficiency is as high as ca. 95% of the theoretical value. This is much higher than those of the commercial Fe3O4 powder (160 mAh/g) and the Fe3O4 carbon counter material (310 mAh/g). It was demonstrated that the thin titania precoating layer (thickness ca. 3-5 nm) is necessary for the high content loading of the Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto the carbon nanofibers. Owing to the unique three-dimensional porous network structure of the carbon-fiber scaffold, together with the ultrathin outer carbon-coating layer, the composite showed significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability.

Single-walled carbon nanotubes were among the first of those materials to attract the attention of the photonics community owing to their high third order susceptibility, broadband operation, and ultrafast response. Saturable absorption, in particular, has become a widespread application for nanotubes in the mode-locking of a fiber laser where they are used as nonlinear passive amplitude modulators to initiate pulsed operation. Numerous approaches have been proposed for the integration of nanotubes in fiber systems; these can be divided into those that rely on direct interaction (where the nanotubes are sandwiched between fiber connectors) and those that rely on lateral interaction with the evanescence field of the propagating wave. Tapered fibers, in particular, offer excellent flexibility to adjust the nonlinearity of nanotube-based devices but suffer from high losses (typically exceeding 50%) and poor saturable to non-saturable absorption ratios (typically above 1: 5). In this paper, we propose a method to fabricate carbon nanotube saturable absorbers with controllable saturation power, low-losses (as low as 15%), and large saturable to non-saturable loss ratios approaching 1:1. This is achieved by optimizing the procedure of embedding tapered fibers in low-refractive index polymers. In addition, this study sheds light in the operation of these devices, highlighting a trade-off between losses and saturation power and providing guidelines for the design of saturable absorbers according to their application.

Ultra-small sulphur nanoparticles configured inside a flexible organic mixed conducting network as a cathode for lithium-sulphur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; POLYANILINE NANOTUBES; ION; SEMICONDUCTOR; COMPOSITES; POLYMERS; GRAPHENE; HYBRID	The major challenges in Li-S batteries are the formation of soluble polysulphides during the reversible conversion of S-8 <-> Li2S, large changes in sulphur particle volume during lithiation and extremely poor charge transport in sulphur. We demonstrate here a novel and simple strategy to overcome these challenges towards practical realization of a stable high performance Li-S battery. For the first time, a strategy is developed which does away with the necessity of pre-fabricated high surface area hollow-structured adsorbates and also multiple nontrivial synthesis steps related to sulphur loading inside such adsorbates. A lithiated polyethylene glycol (PEG) based surfactant tethered on ultra-small sulphur nanoparticles and wrapped up with polyaniline (PAni) (abbreviated as S-MIEC) is demonstrated here as an exceptional cathode for Li-S batteries. The PEG and PAni network around the sulphur nanoparticles serves as an efficient flexible trap for sulphur and polysulphides and also provides distinct pathways for electrons (through PAni) and ions (through PEG) during battery operation. Contrary to the cathodes demonstrated based on various carbon-sulphur composites, the mixed conducting S-MIEC showed an extremely high loading of 75%. The S-MIEC exhibited a stable capacity of nearly 900 mA h g(-1) at the end of 100 cycles at a 1C current rate.

Depth-dependent soil organic carbon dynamics of croplands across the Chengdu Plain of China from the 1980s to the 2010s	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						agricultural land use; parent material; soil organic carbon; soil profiles; topography	LAND-USE CHANGE; FLOODED MULCHING CULTIVATION; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; STRAW MULCH; NITROGEN; FRACTIONS; STORAGE; REGION; FERTILIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY	Agricultural soils have tremendous potential to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) and mitigate global climate change. However, agricultural land use has a profound impact on SOC dynamics, and few studies have explored how agricultural land use combined with soil conditions affect SOC changes throughout the soil profile. Based on a paired soil resampling campaign in the 1980s and 2010s, this study investigated the SOC changes of the soil profile caused by agricultural land use and the correlations with parent material and topography across the Chengdu Plain of China. The results showed that the SOC content increased by 3.78 g C/kg in the topsoil (0-20 cm), but decreased in the 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm soil layers by 0.90 and 1.26 g C/kg respectively. SOC increases in topsoil were observed for all types of agricultural land. Afforestation on former agricultural land also caused SOC decreases in the 20-60 cm soil layers, while SOC decreases only occurred in the 40-60 cm soil layer for agricultural land using a traditional crop rotation (i.e. traditional rice-wheat/rapeseed rotation) and with rice-vegetable rotations converted from the traditional rotations. For each agricultural land use, SOC decreases in deep soils only occurred in high relief areas and in soils formed from Q4 (Quaternary Holocene) grey-brown alluvium and Q4 grey alluvium that had a relatively low soil bulk density and clay content. The results indicated that SOC change caused by agricultural land use was depth dependent and that the effects of agricultural land use on soil profile SOC dynamics varied with soil characteristics and topography. Subsoil SOC decreases were more likely to occur in high relief areas and in soils with low soil bulk density and low clay content.

Above all, the designed trinity treatment took effect perfectly and exhibited 56% tumor inhibition rate to breast cancer cells. The newly designed multifunctional nucleic acid structure could serve as a firm basis for the development of anticancer drugs depended on small molecular nucleic acids. Abundant investigators have devoted their efforts to proceed the development of novel strategies aimed at anti-tumor through regulating gene expression negatively. Flap structure-specific endonuclease 1 (FEN1) received widespread attention in becoming a potential target for breast cancer. In this study, a prominent protocol based on small molecular nucleic acids was reasonably demonstrated. Various oligonucleotides containing FEN1 cleavage site and anti-miRNA21 sequences were designed and synthesized as a kind of disturbance factor to FEN1 and miRNA21. In order to obtain an ideal therapeutic outcome, graphene oxide (GO) was also employed, which rendered the whole system with photothermal therapy (PTT) effect. Finally, a novel trinity treatment system came into being with the characteristic of combined therapy involving miRNA21 silencing, FEN1 inhibition and PTT. In short, it is our hope that the designed multifunctional system could provide a promising use for the development of anti-tumor therapy in the foreseeable future.

The microchanneled mold was patterned with a funnel-shaped channel to minimize nanotube jamming during capillary-driven inflow. Two (i.e.pre- and post-capillary) gas blows were employed to improve nanotube alignment. The fluidically pre-aligned carbon nanotubes were 'gas-spun' into a long 20 nm wide pattern, significantly narrower than the fluidic pre-alignment channel. These narrow and long aligned SWNT patterns were successfully transferred to a pair of gold electrodes spaced 15 mu m apart. The performance of the carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNTFET) fabricated by this technique was evaluated.

FeNi3 and NiFe2O4 are found as metallic and metal oxide compounds closely embedded in an N-doped carbon-carbon nanotube matrix. This hybrid catalyst (Fe-Ni@NC-CNTs) significantly promotes the charge transfer efficiency and restrains the corrosion of the metallic catalysts, which is shown in a high OER and HER activity with an overpotential of 274 and 202mV, respectively at 10mAcm(-2) in alkaline solution. When this bifunctional catalyst was further used for H-2 and O-2 production in an electrochemical water-splitting unit, it can operate in ambient conditions with a competitive gas production rate of 1.15 and 0.57Ls(-1) for hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, showing its potential for practical applications.

Electrophoretic deposition of LiFePO4 onto 3-D current collectors for high areal loading battery cathodes	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING B-ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL SOLID-STATE MATERIALS			English	Article						Lithium-ion batteries; LiFePO4; Electrophoretic deposition; Three-dimensional current collector; Carbon cloth; Cycling stability; Areal capacity	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERY; CARBON NANOTUBES; ION BATTERIES; COMPOSITE; PERFORMANCE; NANOWIRE; COST; NANOPARTICLES; OPTIMIZATION; SUSPENSIONS	Three-dimensional (3-D) current collectors in lithium-ion batteries with high areal loading of cathode materials enables reduced packaging weight and cost compared to planar current collector materials. Here, we demonstrate the use of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) as a route to prepare thick cathode assembles in 3-D scaffolds using LiFePO4 with areal loadings measured from 2 mg/cm(2) and up to 20 mg/cm(2) in conductive carbon cloth materials. Our findings demonstrate the LiFePO4 cathodes with areal capacity up to similar to 2.4 mAh/cm(2) and minimal decay (< 0.11%) per cycle. This emphasizes EPD as both a technique to overcome the limitations of conventional manufacturing approaches in scaling to 3-D collector architectures for improved cell-level energy density, but also a route to transition away from costly NMP processing toward cheaper, less toxic solvents, such as ethanol as is demonstrated in this study.

However, significant impediments are the sluggish K2S oxidation kinetics and a lack of atomic-level understanding of K2S oxidation. Here, for the first time, we report the catalytic oxidation of K2S on a sulfur host with Co single atoms immobilized on nitrogen-doped carbon. On the basis of combined spectroscopic characterizations, electrochemical evaluation, and theoretical computations, we show a synergistic effect of dynamic Co-S and N-K interactions to catalyze K2S oxidation. The resultant potassium-sulfur battery exhibited high capacities of 773 and 535 mAh g(-1) under high current densities of 1 and 2 C, respectively. These findings provide atomic-scale insights for the rational design of highly efficient sulfur hosts.

In this study, an acid-triggered charge-reversible graphene-based all-in-one nanocomplex is appropriately designed by surface modification with multilayer polymers and simultaneous co-transportation of photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) and oligonucleotide inhibitor of miR-21 (miR-21i) to achieve highly efficient genetic phototherapy in a controlled manner. The nanocomplex (denoted as GPCP/miR-21i/ICG) effectively protects miR-21i from degradation and exhibits excellent photothermal/photochemical reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as well as fluorescence imaging ability. The cargoes ICG and miR-21i can significantly be released at acidic pH compared with normal physiological medium and escaped from endosomes/lysosomes due to the acid-triggered charge reversal effect. Typically, the released miR-21i downregulate the endogenous miR-21 and result in the upregulation of the target proteins PTEN and Bax, thus increasing the phototherapeutic efficiency of ICG. High in vivo anticancer efficiency against the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model is obtained due to the combination of genetic regulation of miR-21i and the photokilling effect of ICG. This work highlights the great potential of this smart nanocomplex as an attractive modality of gene-photo combined treatment of cancer, especially for intractable TNBC.

Association of the genes for tumor necrosis factor-alpha and myelin basic protein with delayed encephalopathy after acute carbon monoxide poisoning	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Carbon monoxide poisoning; Encephalopathy; Tumor necrosis factor-alpha; Myelin basic protein; Gene polymorphism	MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; TNF-ALPHA; PROMOTER POLYMORPHISM; CELLS	There is structural damage to myelin and secondary immune injury in the development of delayed encephalopathy after acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning (DEACMP). In order to assess the role of genetic factors in this mechanism, we studied the association between tumor necrosis factor-alpha 308 (TNF-alpha 308) and myelin basic protein (MBP) 5'-side tetranucleotide repetitive sequence (TGGA) n gene polymorphism and DEACMP. We selected 109 DEACMP patients from the Han population in the Northern Henan Province as the case group, and 115 patients without delayed encephalopathy (called the acute CO poisoning group or the control group). There were no significant differences in TNF-alpha 308 and MBP 5'-side TGGA n genotype distribution and allele frequency between the DEACMP group and the acute CO poisoning group (all P > 0.05). When the population was stratified by gender, only the MBP 5'-side TGGA n allele frequency was significantly different, and the frequency of allele L in the DEACMP group was significantly higher than that of the acute CO poisoning group in males (chi(2) = 4.089, P = 0.043, odds ratio = 2.103, 95% confidence interval = 1.014-4.363). The results showed that there was association between MBP 5'-side TGGA n gene polymorphism and DEACMP, and that allele L could increase the risk of occurrence in male patients with DEACMP. DEACMP may be the result of interaction of environmental and genetic factors.	[Li, S. G.; Zhang, P.; Zhang, H. X.; Gu, J. P.; Gu, R.

Here we design and construct a Synthetic Acetyl-CoA (SACA) pathway by repurposing glycolaldehyde synthase and acetyl-phosphate synthase. First, we design and engineer glycolaldehyde synthase to improve catalytic activity more than 70-fold, to condense two molecules of formaldehyde into one glycolaldehyde. Second, we repurpose a phosphoketolase to convert glycolaldehyde into acetyl-phosphate. We demonstrated the feasibility of the SACA pathway in vitro, achieving a carbon yield similar to 50%, and confirmed the SACA pathway by C-13-labeled metabolites. Finally, the SACA pathway was verified by cell growth using glycolaldehyde, formaldehyde and methanol as supplemental carbon source. The SACA pathway is proved to be the shortest, ATP-independent, carbon-conserving and oxygen-insensitive pathway for acetylCoA biosynthesis, opening possibilities for producing acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals from one-carbon resources in the future.

One group of ponds with sediment improver application were referred to as SAPs, and the other group receiving no sediment improver were as NSPs. During the farming season, both the SAPs and NSPs acted as CO2 sinks and CH4 sources. The cumulative CO2-C fluxes from the SAPs and NSPs were -26.78 and -23.49 g m(-2), respectively, and the cumulative CH4-C emissions from the SAPs and NSPs were 0.24 and 0.28 g m(-2), respectively. CO2 fluxes were significantly related to net primary production and water pH, and CH4 fluxes were mainly regulated by water temperature during the farming season. The application of the oxidation-based sediment improver had a positive effect on reducing the CH4 emissions across the water-air interface but had no effect on CO2 fluxes. The sediment improver reduced the organic matter contents and improved the sediment pH and redox potential, which may have facilitated a decrease in CH4 production in the sediment. The CO2 produced through the oxidation of organic material in the sediment may have been absorbed by strong photosynthesis, resulting in a nonsignificant difference in CO2 fluxes between the SAPs and NSPs. The results indicated that the application of sediment improvers in coastal polyculture ponds can reduce carbon emissions, especially CH4 emissions, during the farming period and could help mitigate global warming with regard to the sustained-flux global warming potential (SGWP) and sustained-flux global cooling potential (SGCP) models over a 20-year time horizon. Future studies on the CO2 and CH4 production rates of the sediment and the related microbial community could improve our understanding of the effect mechanism of the application of sediment improvers on CO2 and CH4 emissions from mariculture ponds.

With the advantages of natural abundance, low cost, and environment friendliness, a one-dimensional (1D) MnO2 nanowire (MW) is the representative dielectric-loss absorber for its special morphology and crystalline structure. However, its low reflection loss (RL) value due to its thin thickness limits its wide development and application in the microwave absorption field. In this work, artificially designed MnO2 @ AIR @ C (MCs), namely, 1D hollow carbon nanotubes filled with nano-MnO2, were designed and synthesized. It is found that the RL value of the MC is almost lower than -10 dB. Furthermore, the RL value was able to achieve -18.9 dB with an effective bandwidth (-10 dB) of 5.84 GHz at 2.25 mm. Simultaneously, the dielectric and interfacial polarization became stronger while the impedance matching was much better than in the single MWs. Hence, the rational design and fabrication of micro-architecture are essential and MC has great potential to be an outstanding microwave absorber.

Here, nanostructured CoP nanoparticles locked in hollow nitrogen doped carbon frameworks (CoP@HNC) were successfully designed and characterized for their morphology, composition, and electrochemistry. In a typical low-temperature phosphorization process, the Co species in carbonized poly-dopamine (PDA) coated ZIF-67 are converted to either hollow CoP or small-sized solid CoP nanoparticles governed by the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The PDA layers derived nitrogen-doped carbon components feature a hollow polyhedral structure, with CoP nanoparticles imbedded in the shell. CoP@HNC demonstrates a low overpotential of 327 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and a good operational stability (72 h) for alkaline OER. The HNC encapsulation affords the low electronic resistance between CoP nanoparticles, as well as the mechanical and chemical stability of composites by preventing the aggregation of CoP nanoparticles during the OER process.

However, the shutting effect of polysulfides and sluggish kinetics of sulfur redox reactions still severely limit their practical implementation. Herein, a new type of 3D hierarchical porous carbonaceous nanocubes is reported as efficient sulfur hosts, composed of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and Co nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly embedded into a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (NC). Because of the high specific surface area, large degree of graphitization, and the synergetic effects between Co NPs and N-doping, the as-designed CNTs/Co@NC electrodes not only significantly increase polysulfides immobilization, but also efficiently catalyze sulfur redox reactions, as confirmed by experimental results and DFT calculations. When tested in a RT Na-S battery, the S@CNTs/Co@NC-0.25 cathode demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance, achieving high initial specific capacity of 1200.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, remarkable rate capability up to 5.0 C (474.2 mAh g(-1)), and superior cyclic performance of 450.5 mAh g(-1) (292 mAh g(-1)) after 400 cycles at 1.0 C (5.0 C). The integration of a 3D hierarchical porous architecture with well-dispersed Co NPs of an electro-catalyst provides valuable insights based on structure-adsorption-catalysis engineering for advanced RT Na-S batteries.

Through these surface-driven charge storage behaviors, HN-PPs achieve a significantly high specific capacity of 460 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), maintaining specific capacities of 140 mA h g(-1) at a high specific current of 30 A g(-1) and 305 mA h g(-1) after 2000 cycles at 3 A g(-1). Furthermore, asymmetric energy storage devices based on HN-PPs deliver a high specific energy of 265 W h kg(-1) and high specific power of 5081 W kg(-1) with long-term cycling performance.

The textural characteristics of the samples were studied by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The chemical properties of the samples were characterized by energy-dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that the oxygen-containing functional groups on activated carbon have a great influence on Hg-0 adsorption and the functional groups increase the acidity, polarity, and hydrophobicity of the carbon surface and promote the Hg-0 adsorption. The Hg-0 adsorption of activated carbon mainly manifests as chemical adsorption. The desorbed activated carbon almost has no Hg-0 removal ability although it still has a huge surface area and a microspore structure. The oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface play a key role in Hg-0 adsorption. Among them, carbonyl, carboxyl, and ester groups promoted mercury adsorption, while the phenolic hydroxyl group induced inhibition. The process of Hg-0 adsorption on modified activated carbon could be described with the pseudo-second-order model, which indicated that the chemisorption is the dominant step in the Hg-0 removal process by modified activated carbon. Kinetic calculation results also show that under a given gas condition, modified activated carbon possessed a bigger equilibrium adsorption capacity but displayed poor adsorption kinetics.

In comparison to amide (-O-NH2) and polyethylene-glycol (-PEG) functionalized SWCNT, carboxylic acid (-COOH) variants gave optimal viability support which correlated with maximal reduction of lethal mitochondrial superoxides in HSPC. Cytokine array illustrated that f-SWCNT-COOH maintained higher proportion of HSPC associated cytokines and minimal level of differentiation promoting factors. Transplantation of f-SWCNT-COOH expanded grafts in sublethally irradiated immunodeficient mice resulted in higher engraftment of HSPC in bone marrow compared to control when they were co-transplanted with non-expanded cells from the same UCB. Expanded grafts mediated higher survival rate of mice compared to non-expanded grafts due to lower graft-versus-host-disease which is likely a consequence of proportion of immune cells in the grafts. From the Clinical Editor: Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a potential source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC) cells. One major hurdle for its clinical use is the insufficient yield of cell number. The authors in this study elegantly demonstrated the importance of various functional groups on single-walled carbon nanotubes (f-SWCNT) in enhancing ex vivo expansion of HSPC in UCB. The findings may pave a way for having UCB as a source for HSPC for clinical use in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

By the utilization of the structure of the biochar, micro-/macro-ordered porous carbon with olive-shaped structure was successfully achieved through pyrolysis at 500 A degrees C, which is the optimal temperature for biofuel production, and was activated with HCl. The biochar and HCl treatment biochar (HTB) were applied as anode electrode in lithium ion batteries. Then, electrochemical measurements were conducted on the electrodes via galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. The electrochemical results indicated a higher specific discharge capacity (700 mAh g(-1)) and good cycling stability for HTB at the current density of 0.1 A g(-1) as compared to the biochar. The reason that HTB electrode works better than the biochar could be due to the higher surface area, formation functional groups, removal impurities, and formation some micropores after HCl treatment. The biochar derived from marine biomass and treatment process developed here could provide a promising path for the low-cost, renewable, and environmentally friendly electrode materials.

Given this, our primary focus will be on how to use "off-the-shelf" components to prepare carbon nanotubes for use in a wide variety of applications, although our specific emphases will be on 2D patterning of nanotubes and stretchable electronics. Specifically, stretchable strain gauges were selected as the case study because they are an excellent showcase for the versatility and ease of manufacturing of nanotube-based devices, while the techniques to produce them are the same techniques that would be used for many other nanotube-based devices. We will begin with an overview of the challenges of sensing large strains and the limitations of status quo devices. Armed with that knowledge, we will then discuss why carbon nanotubes are particularly well suited to address the problem and how to acquire, prepare, and post-process them into a sensor. Finally, we will present an inexpensive, simple strain gauge design based on piezocapacitive strain transduction capable of straining to a minimum of 20x farther than the best traditional metal foil gauge.

In the absence of water vapor at 773-923 K, the reaction rate constant was k = 5210 exp(-113600/(RT)). NO reduction ratio rapidly increased with reaction residence time at initial stage (<1 s) and T > 873 K; high NO reduction ratio was achieved by increasing reaction temperature when the initial concentration ratio of CO to NO was less than 4. In the presence of water, the catalytic effect of coal gangue hollow ball on NO reduction was weakened, and the reaction rate constant was k = 0.31 exp(-60750/(RT)). NO reduction ratio is less than 02 when reaction residence time was 2.5 s at T <= 923 K when the initial concentration ratio of CO to NO was 4, and the initial concentration ratio of CO to NO had negligible effect on NO reduction ratio at T <= 923 K.

The basic performance, optimized conditions, sensitivity and selectivity of the logic gate were investigated and revealed that the method is highly sensitive and selective over potentially interfering ions. The limits of detection for Ag(I) and iodide are 10 nM and 50 nM, respectively. This logic gate was successfully applied to the determination of Ag(I) and iodide in (spiked) tap water and river water.

However, the stabilities in chemical state and catalytic performance of these nanocatalysts often suffer during harsh conditions. For Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on CeO2, activated oxygen diffused from the support over-stabilizes the active sites of Pt, degrading its performance at mild temperature. In this work, Pt nanocatalysts with unique structure of triple-junction are synthesized by selectively growing Pt NPs on the carbon-CeO2 interface. Impressively, the Pt NPs exhibit much enhanced catalytic stability and high activity for CO oxidation at mild temperature. The enhancement is attributed to electron donation from graphitized carbon and the confinement effect from the high-density nanopores of the CeO2 support. The triple-junction of Pt-C-CeO2, combining the merits of CeO2 for activating O-2 and electron donating capability of carbon, provides new inspiration to the fabrication of high-performance nanocatalysts.

The combination of the low redox potential and low cost and the energy-dense calcium anode (2073 mAh/cm(3), similar to 2044 mAh/cm(3) for Li) with appropriate low-cost cathode materials such as sulfur could produce a game-changing technology in several fields of applications. In this work, we present the reversible activity of a proof-of-concept Ca/S battery at room temperature, characterized by a surprising medium-term cycling stability with low polarization, promoted by the use of a simple positive electrode made of sulfur supported on an activated carbon cloth scaffold, and a state-of-the-art fluorinated alkoxyborate-based electrolyte. Insights into the electrochemical mechanism governing the chemistry of the Ca/S system were obtained for the first time by combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The mechanism implies the formation of different types of soluble polysulfide species during both charge and discharge at room temperature, and the formation of solid CaS at the end of discharge. The reversible electrochemical activity is proven by the reformation of elemental sulfur at the end of the following charge. These promising results open the way to the comprehension of emerging Ca/S systems, which may represent a valid alternative to Mg/S and Li/S batteries.

In this work, a new method derived Ni-0@carbon nanostructure was constructed on SiO2 in order to explore an alternative way to improve the intrinsic activity of Ni-0 in the selective hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB). The experimental and computational results exhibit that the synergistic effect between Ni-0 core and nitrogen-doped carbon shell (Ni-0@C-N) can dissociate more hydrogen on larger Ni-0 core (similar to 14 nm) than Ni-0@C (Ni-0 = 11 nm), while the external surface of carbon shell facilitates the oblique adsorption of p-CNB and the consequent hydrogenation. Such formed dual-reaction surfaces inhibit the dechlorination reaction but increase the active hydrogen species. Consequently, Ni-0@C-N/SiO2 catalyst (similar to 14 nm) adversely displays similar to 2.3-fold higher turnover frequency and similar to 100% p-chloroaniline selectivity, in contrast to Ni-0@C/SiO2 (similar to 11 nm) and the commercial Raney Ni (similar to 6 nm) catalysts.

However, typical polymers used in conductive filaments for 3D printing show high resistivity and low compatibility with electrochemical energy applications. Removal of insulating thermoplastics in as-printed materials is a common post-printing strategy, however, excessive loss of thermoplastics can weaken the structural integrity. This work reports a two-step surface engineering methodology for fabrication of 3D-printed carbon materials for electrochemical applications, incorporating conductive poly(ortho-phenylenediamine) (PoPD) via electrodeposition. A conductive PoPD effectively enhances the electrochemical activities of 3D-printed frameworks. When PoPD-refilled frameworks casted with LiMn2O4 (LMO) composite materials used as battery cathode, it delivers a capacity of 69.1 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 0.036 mA cm(-2) (approximate to 1.2 C discharge rate) and good cyclability with a retained capacity of 84.4% after 200 cycles at 0.36 mA cm(-2). This work provides a pathway for developing electroactive 3D-printed electrodes particularly with cost-efficient low-dimensional carbon materials for aqueous rechargeable Li-ion batteries.

Surprisingly, the cell containing the isolated Li2S particles delivered considerable charge and discharge capacities despite the prevention of any charge transfer process between the Li2S particles and the carbon cathode. This fact directly indicates that the electrochemical oxidation of Li2S occurs not through a direct charge (electron) transfer between solid Li2S and conducting materials but through chemical reactions coupled with the charge transfer process. We believe that these unexpected results will greatly contribute to a deep understanding of the exact working mechanism of Li-S batteries and Li2S cathodes as well as a paradigm shift toward an innovative and rational design of Li-S batteries.

The weight of therapeutic safety was significantly amplified for decision-making to minimize the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Herein, the safety and effectiveness of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for unresectable liver cancer (ULC) were evaluated, and Chinese experiences were shared to solve the predicament of ULC treatment caused by SARS-CoV-2. Worldwide studies were collected to evaluate CIRT for ULC as the world has become a community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We not only searched five international databases including the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus but also performed supplementary retrieval with other sources. Chinese experiences of fighting against COVID-19 were introduced based on the advancements of CIRT in China and a prospective clinical trial of CIRT for treating ULC. A total of 19 studies involving 813 patients with ULC were included in the systematic review. The qualitative synthetic evaluation showed that compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), CIRT could achieve superior overall survival, local control, and relative hepatic protection. The systematic results indicated that non-invasive CIRT could significantly minimize harms to patients with ULC and concurrently obtain superior anti-cancer effectiveness. According to the Chinese experience, CIRT allows telemedicine within the hospital (TMIH) to keep a sufficient person-to-person physical distance in the whole process of treatment for ULC, which is significant for cutting off the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, CIRT could maximize the utilization rate of hospitalization and outpatient care (UHO). Collectively, CIRT for ULC patients not only allows TMIH and the maximized UHO but also has the compatible advantages of safety and effectiveness. Therefore, CIRT should be identified as the optimal strategy for treating appropriate ULC when we need to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to improve the capacity of medical service in the context of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

Li-Se batteries using Se as the cathode material have high discharge rates, good cyclic performance, high electrical conductivities, high output voltages, and high volumetric capacity densities, and therefore, they are potential alternatives to Li-S systems. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as new porous crystalline materials with large specific surface areas, high porosities, low densities, good thermal stabilities, and controllable structures. Therefore, COFs have wide potential applicability in the fields of gas adsorption, heterogeneous catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery. Based on the above analysis, a simple core-shell multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp)-phenylenediamine (Pa) COF nanocomposite (MWCNT@TpPa-COF) was prepared by growing a TpPa-COF on MWCNTs through a simple solvothermal reaction. The MWCNT@TpPa-COF high-performance cathode material realizes the first application of a COF in Li-Se batteries. The MWCNTs can encapsulate Se, limit the diffusion of polyselenides (Li2Sen, 3 <= n <= 8), and provide rapid electron conduction and ion transmission. In addition, the n-n interaction between MWCNTs and COFs promotes COF growth and distribution on the MWCNTs, thereby forming core-shell MWCNT@TpPa-COF nanocomposites, which can further increase the loading of Se. Measurements via field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the successful combination of MWCNTs and COFs. The rich micro- and mesoporous hierarchical structure provides the MWCNT@TpPa-COF nanocomposites with initial specific discharge capacities reaching 463.5 mAh.g(-1) at the current density of 3C (1C = 675 mA.g(-1)). Cells utilizing the nanocomposite electrodes maintained 99% Coulombic efficiency, with the average cyclic capacitive loss of 0.14% after 500 cycles. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and multiple-rate cycling analyses support the excellent electrochemical performance of the proposed cathode material. This work provides a promising new prospect for the future development of rechargeable Li-Se batteries utilizing new COF-based cathode materials.

Based on the mechanisms of the sodium ions storage in carbon materials, herein we present a multiple active sites decorated amorphous carbon (MAC) with rich structural defects and heteroatom doping as an anode material for SIBs. The full utilization of fast bonding-debonding processes between the active sites and sodium ions could bring a capacitive strategy to achieve superior sodium storage properties. Consequently, after materials characterization and electrochemical evaluation, the as-prepared electrode could deliver high rate and long-life performance. This active-site-related design could be extended to other types of electrode materials, thereby contributing to future practical SIB applications.

However, the practical applications of metal oxides are limited due to their large volume changes and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, carbon coated Fe-2(MoO4)(3) nanosheets are prepared via a simple method, adopting urea as the template and carbon source. The carbon coating on the surface helps to elevate the conductivity of the active material and maintain structural integrity during the lithium storage process. Combining this with a catalytic effect from the generated Fe, leading to the reversible formation of a solid electrolyte interface layer, a high initial coulombic efficiency (>87%) can be obtained. Based on this, the carbon coated Fe-2(MoO4)(3) nanosheets show excellent rate capability (a reversible discharge capacity of 983 mA h g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)) and stable cycling performance (1376 mA h g(-1) after 250 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1) and 864 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 2 A g(-1)). This simple in situ carbonization and template method using urea provides a facile way to optimize electrode materials for next-generation energy storage devices.

However, to date, only limited studies have been conducted on using of longer CNTs over 1 mm in length. This study used long multiwalled carbon nanotubes (LMWCNTs) and their longer extended networks to test multiple properties in thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and modulus and then compared these properties to those of shorter multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SMWCNTs). For carbon fiber-reinforced composites, the longer graphite paths from LMWCNTs in the matrix were expected to improve all properties. The longer networks were expected to allow for more undisturbed phonon transportation to improve thermal conductivity. This in turn relates to improved electrical conductivity and better mechanical properties. However, results have shown that the LMWCNTs do not improve or decrease thermal conductivity, whereas the shorter MWCNTs provide mixed results. LMWCNTs did show improvements in electrical, mechanical, and physical properties, but compared to shorter MWCNTs, the results in other certain properties varied. This perplexing outcome resides in the functioning of the networks made by both the LMWCNTs and shorter MWCNTs.

It shows excellent cycling stability by virtue of effectively alleviating pulverization of tin-based electrode materials caused by volume expansion.

In this work, we prepared a novel electrode with the modification of nitrogen-doped carboxyl multiwalled carbon nanotubes using dopamine as an eco-friendly nitrogen source (carboxyl MWCNT@PDAt). Characterization and electrochemical measurements reveal that the synthesized carboxyl MWCNT@PDAt-modified graphite felt electrode (carboxyl MWCNT@PDAt/GF) exhibits excellent electrochemical performance toward VO2+/VO2+ reaction. Superior battery performance was obtained with the energy efficiency of 80.54% at a current density of 80 mA cm(-2). Excellent durability of the carboxyl MWCNT@PDAt/GF electrode was confirmed by long-term charge/discharge tests. The enhanced reaction kinetics of VO2+/VO2+ is ascribed to the synergetic effect of oxygen and nitrogen containing groups on graphite felt surface and the presence of nitrogen-doped carboxyl multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). The facile approach proposed in this paper provides a new route to the fabrication of electrode with excellent performance for VRFB.

Continued Emissions of the Ozone-Depleting Substance Carbon Tetrachloride From Eastern Asia	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; GLOBAL EMISSIONS; INVERSIONS; HALOCARBONS; GASES; CCL4	Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is an ozone-depleting substance, accounting for about 10% of the chlorine in the troposphere. Under the terms of the Montreal Protocol, its production for dispersive uses was banned from 2010. In this work we show that, despite the controls on production being introduced, CCl4 emissions from the eastern part of China did not decline between 2009 and 2016. This finding is in contrast to a recent bottom-up estimate, which predicted a significant decrease in emissions after the introduction of production controls. We find eastern Asian emissions of CCl4 to be 16 (9-24) Gg/year on average between 2009 and 2016, with the primary source regions being in eastern China. The spatial distribution of emissions that we derive suggests that the source distribution of CCl4 in China changed during the 8-year study period, indicating a new source or sources of emissions from China's Shandong province after 2012. Plain LanguageSummary Carbon tetrachloride is one of several man-made gases that contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer high in the atmosphere. Because of this, restrictions were introduced on the use of this ozone-depleting substance, with the expectation that production should by now be close to 0. However, the slower than expected rate of decline of carbon tetrachloride in the atmosphere shows this is not the case, and a large portion of global emissions are unaccounted for. In this study we use atmospheric measurements of carbon tetrachloride from a site in East Asia to identify the magnitude and location of emissions from this region between 2009 and 2016. We find that there are significant ongoing emissions from eastern China and that these account for a large part of the missing emissions from global estimates. The presence of continued sources of this important ozone-depleting substance indicates that more could be done to speed up the recovery of the ozone layer.	[Lunt, M.

This 2-year work aims to estimate the economic benefit, energy budget and carbon footprint of a wheat-maize double cropping system under conventional rain-fed flat planting (irrigation once a year, control), ridge-furrows with plastic film mulching on the ridge (irrigation once a year, RP), and the WI in dry semi-humid areas of China. Significantly higher wheat and maize yields and net returns were achieved under RP than those under the control, while a visible reduction was found for wheat yields when compared with the WI. The ratio of benefit: cost under RP was also higher by 10.5% than that under the control in the first rotation cycle, but did not differ with those under WI. The net energy output and carbon output followed the same trends with net returns, but the RP had the largest energy use efficiency, energy productivity carbon efficiency and carbon sustainability among treatments. Therefore, the RP was an effective substitution for well-irrigated planting strategy for achieving sustained agricultural development in dry semi-humid areas.

Three different methods were developed for loading AgNPs on CNCs, which include (i) direct deposition of AgNPs on CNCs by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering (RFMS) to form an Ag-CNC hybrid, (ii) deposition of a TiO2 film on CNCs by RFMS, followed by photoinduced growth of AgNPs to form an Ag-TiO2-CNC hybrid (called A-substrate), and (iii) deposition of a TiO2 film on CNCs by spin coating and then photoinduced growth of AgNPs to form an Ag-TiO2-CNC hybrid (called B-substrate). Experimental SERS results showed that B-substrates exhibited the highest SERS enhancement with an enhancement factor of over 10(7) for rhodamine 6G. The as-prepared Ag-TiO2-CNC substrates also showed much higher Raman signal enhancement than ordinary planar SERS substrates in our system. This was mainly due to the unique three-dimensional structure where the large surface area was available for loading more densely packed AgNPs which contribute to abundant Raman hot spots.

In this paper, SnSe nanoparticles were dispersed within a carbon fiber matrix with ball milling and electrospinning methods. The uniform nano-architecture with SnSe nanoparticles homogeneously confined in the carbon matrix, which is revealed by X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscope, provides a stable buffer and good electrical conductor for the lithiation/delithiation process. Moreover, Se-based phase acts as an additional stabilizer to alleviate Sn agglomeration during cycling. Such dual-buffered SnSe/C composites thus deliver large reversible capacity of 840 mAh/g with ultrastable cycling performance over 100 cycles and demonstrate good rate capacity.

Hybridization of different fiber types within composite laminates provides opportunities to extend the design space and optimize properties such as strength and toughness. In this paper, the Mode II fracture behavior of a hybrid carbon-Dyneema fiber-reinforced composite is studied experimentally. The usual linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) methods for measurement of interlaminar toughness are not readily applicable to hybrid composites due to the presence of large fracture process zones and extensive fiber bridging. Continuously increasing R-curves are obtained from standard data reduction approaches, resulting in poor estimates of Mode II interlaminar toughness values. A more general J-integral-based method coupled with digital image correlation technique is proposed here to obtain more consistent and accurate results. Specimens with different intralaminar and interlaminar hybridization schemes are explored, and the delamination process as well as toughening mechanisms is examined through a fractographic analysis.

The microstructures of the obtained materials are examined and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, SEM and TEM. It is confirmed that the surface of AB(5) alloy is modified by shorter carbon nanotubes and thin carbon flake, respectively, when carbon nanotubes and carbon black are added. The electrochemical properties of the obtained materials are measured and compared with those of the original AB(5) alloy. It is found that high rate discharge ability of the alloys after surface modification by carbon nanomaterials increases to some extent due to the decrease of electrochemical reaction resistance and the increase of double capacitance as obtained by electrochemical impedance spectra. In particular, the modified alloy with the carbon nanotubes shows a superior performance to carbon black, especially in the discharge rate of 2000 mA/g. Besides, the addition of carbon nanomaterials reduces the extent of the amorphism of the AB(5) alloy during ball milling. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was confirmed by SEM images that a few carbon nanotubes coated or uncoated with AB(5) alloy stuck out of the surface of the alloy. The effects of the addition of carbon nanotubes on the structure and the electrochemical characteristics of AB(5)-type alloy were investigated by XRD and electrochemical measurements. Discharge plateau curves of sigmoid shape were clearly observed for AB(5)-CNT electrodes during the initial activation, which was different from the original AB(5) electrode. In addition, the results indicate that, with the addition of carbon nanotubes, the unit cell volume decreased resulting in a decrease of the stability of the metal hydride and an increase in the discharge plateau potential. The discharge capacity for the alloys decreased with decreasing stability of the metal hydride due to the decrease of maximum amount of the absorbed hydrogen, but the high-rate dischargeability was improved due to the increase in the rate of hydrogen diffusion in the alloys. The capacity retaining ability of the alloys did not remarkably decrease with the addition of carbon nanotubes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Our in vitro experiments showed that f-SWCNT-COOH increased the viability of the CD45(+) cells even without cytokine stimulation. It also reduced mitochondrial superoxides and caspase activity in CD45(+) cells. f-SWCNT-COOH drastically reduced the proportions of CD45(-) cells in the non-enriched UCB-MNC. Phenotypic expression analysis and functional colony forming units (CFU) showed significant ex vivo expansion of HSPC, particularly of CD45(+)CD34(+)CD38(-) population and granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colonies, in f-SWCNT-COOH augmented cultures supplemented with basal cytokines. In vivo data suggested that f-SWCNT-COOH expanded UCB-MNC could repopulate immunodeficient mice models with minimal acute or sub-acute symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and f-SWCNT-COOH dependent toxicity. From the Clinical Editor: In this paper a novel method is presented by using single wall functionalized carbon nanotubes to enhance viability and ex vivo expansion of freeze-thawed, non-enriched hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in human umbilical cord blood - mononucleated cells.

The results showed that the catalysts heat-treated at 1000 degrees C had the best ORR activity and better stability compared with the commercial Pt-based catalysts in acidic medium. The result of XPS showed that the activity of metal-free C-N catalysts was related to the pyridinic-type nitrogen. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of these catalysts were discussed for further investigation.

J	Li, S; Jarvis, AJ; Leedal, DT				Li, Sile; Jarvis, Andrew J.; Leedal, David T.			Are response function representations of the global carbon cycle ever interpretable?	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY			English	Article							UNSTEADY AERODYNAMICS; CONTINUOUS-TIME; OCEAN MODELS; CLIMATE; CO2; IDENTIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; SYSTEMS	Response function models are often used to represent the behaviour of complex, high order global carbon cycle (GCC) and climate models in applications which require short model run times. Although apparently black-box, these response function models need not necessarily be entirely opaque, but instead may also convey useful insights into the properties of the parent model or process. By exploiting a transfer function (TF) framework to analyse the Lenton GCC model, this paper attempts to demonstrate that response function representations of GCC models can sometimes also provide structural information on the parent model from which they are identified and calibrated. We take a fifth-order TF identified from the impulse response of the Lenton model atmospheric burden, and decompose this to show how it can be re-expresses in a generic five-box form in sympathy with the structure of the parent model.

Black carbon emissions from in-use ships: a California regional assessment	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							PARTICLE SOOT PHOTOMETER; LIGHT-ABSORPTION; DIESEL-ENGINES; FUEL QUALITY; AEROSOL; CLIMATE; SPEED; SPECTROMETER; SENSITIVITY; CALIBRATION	Black carbon (BC) mass emission factors (EFBC; g BC (kg fuel)(-1)) from a variety of ocean-going vessels have been determined from measurements of BC and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in ship plumes intercepted by the R/V Atlantis during the 2010 California Nexus (CalNex) campaign. The ships encountered were all operating within 24 nautical miles of the California coast and were utilizing relatively low sulphur fuels (average fuel sulphur content of 0.4%, 0.09% and 0.03% for vessels operating slow-speed, medium-speed and high-speed diesel engines, respectively). Black carbon concentrations within the plumes, from which EFBC values are determined, were measured using four independent instruments: a photoacoustic spectrometer and a particle soot absorption photometer, which measure light absorption, and a single particle soot photometer and soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer, which measure the mass concentration of refractory BC directly. These measurements have been used to assess the level of agreement between these different techniques for the determination of BC emission factors from ship plumes. Also, these measurements greatly expand upon the number of individual ships for which BC emission factors have been determined during real-world operation. The measured EFBC's have been divided into vessel type categories and engine type categories, from which averages have been determined. The geometric average EFBC (excluding outliers) determined from over 71 vessels and 135 plumes encountered was 0.31 +/- 0.31 gBC (kg fuel)(-1), where the standard deviation represents the variability between individual vessels. The most frequent engine type encountered was the slow-speed diesel (SSD), and the most frequent SSD vessel type was the cargo ship sub-category. Average and median EFBC values from the SSD category are compared with previous observations from the Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS) in 2006, during which the ships encountered were predominately operating on high-sulphur fuels (average fuel sulphur content of 1.6 %). There is a statistically significant difference between the EFBC values from CalNex and TexAQS for SSD vessels and for the cargo and tanker ship types within this engine category. The CalNex EFBC values are lower than those from TexAQS, suggesting that operation on lower sulphur fuels is associated with smaller EFBC values.	[Buffaloe, G. M.; Cappa, C.

However, challenges remain in achieving larger capacity and higher discharge voltage, it is therefore of vital significance to illustrate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of S@pPAN or similar materials. Herein, we present conjugate double-bond lithium-ion storage mechanism by solid-state NMR and XPS. During discharge, besides the reaction between sulfur and lithium, the C=N and C=C groups can also react with lithium to form Li-C-N-Li and Li-C-C-Li and afford capacity, resulting a higher practical discharge capacity than the theoretical capacity of elemental sulfur. This electrochemical reaction mechanism provides a new idea for the new energy materials with high capacity.

The adsorption and oxidization performance of MnO2@NHCS were assessed by degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) at different conditions. The effect of dosage of MnO2@NHCS, pH, initial concentration of BPA, temperature and humic acid were investigated systematically. Moreover, the characterizations of MnO2@NHCS were measured by a series of techniques, such as XRD, FESEM, HRTEM, TGA and XPS. Notably, hollow structure of nano carbon sphere was still retained with uniform MnO, nanosheets covered. The results show that the removal rate of BPA was 95.3% within 10 min and BPA can be almost decomposed in 30 min under the optimal conditions. Additionally, the MnO2@NHCS remained stable and had a high regeneration efficiency (more than 85%) after 3 cycles (360 min). The reaction intermediates/products of oxidation of BPA were analyzed and the possible degradation pathways of BPA were proposed. These research results demonstrate that the MnO2@NHCS is a fleet and efficient material for BPA degradation in aqueous environment.

Through controlling electropolymerization, A "polydopamine (PDA)-AFP" complex was achieved applying AFP as template and dopamine (DA) as imprinted monomers. After elution, the specific cavities can adsorb the target molecules. Using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) detection, the peak current decreased with the increase in concentration of AFP, and the linear response range of the AFP-MIP immunosensor was from 0.001 ng/mL to 800 ng/mL with the detection limit as low as 0.8138 pg/mL. The MIP immunosensor could become a new promising method for the detection of AFP. Furthermore, this MIP sensor was demonstrated in testing AFP in human serum samples with satisfactory results.

In this work, a novel composite material with sandwich structure constructed by titanium nitride nanoparticles and boron nitride-carbon nanofibers (BNC-TiN-BNC), has been successfully prepared through electrospinning and spraying method, and applied as the interlayer in LiS batteries. Compared with the BNCNF interlayer, the sandwich-like BNC-TiN-BNC interlayer shows more excellent chemical adsorption for soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) via the polar effects of the TiS and SN bonds, and furthermore, the uniform distribution of TiN nanoparticles, filling in the pores between the nanofibers as packing layer of the BNC-TiN-BNC interlayer, can retard the migration of LiPSs more effectively by physical barriers. By introducing the BNC-TiN-BNC interlayer, the electron transfer, capacity and cycling life of LiS batteries have been improved significantly, especially at high current density. With the sulfur loading of 2.5mg cm(-2,) the cell with BNC-TiN-BNC interlayer delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 642.3 mA h g(-1) at high current density of 2.0C, and the capacity remains 594mA h g(-1) with only the decay rate of 0.025% over 300 cycles.

A Multiscale X-Ray Tomography Study of the Cycled-Induced Degradation in Magnesium-Sulfur Batteries	SMALL METHODS			English	Article						cycling; image-based modeling; Mg/S batteries; X-ray microtomography; X-ray nanotomography		Rechargeable Mg/S batteries have the potential to provide a compelling battery for a range of applications owing to their high capacity and gravimetric energy density, safety, and low-cost construction. However, the Mg/S energy storage is not widely developed and deployed due to technical challenges, which include short cycle lifespan and lack of suitable electrolyte. To study the microstructure degradation of Mg/S batteries, multiscale X-ray tomography, an inherently nondestructive method, is performed on dismantled Swagelok Mg/S cells comprising a graphene-sulfur cathode and a super-P separator. For the first time, 3D microstructure visualization and quantification reveal the dissolution (volume fraction decreases from 13.5% to 0.7%, surface area reduces from 2.91 to 1.74 mu m(2) mu m(-3)) and agglomeration of sulfur particles, and the carbon binder densification after 10 cycles. Using tomography data, the image-based simulations are then performed. The results show that the insoluble polysulfides can inevitably block the Mg2+ transportation via shuttle effect. The representative volume should exceed 8200 mu m(3) to represent bulk cathode. This work elucidates that the Mg/S cell performance is significantly affected by microstructural degradation, and moreover demonstrates how multiscale and multimodal characterization can play an indispensable role in developing and optimizing the Mg/S electrode design.

J	Li, S; Manory, RR				Li, S; Manory, RR			Surface morphology and compound layer pores of plasma nitrocarburized low carbon steel	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							ION	This article deals with various aspects of nitrocarburizing of AISI 1010 steel by DC plasma at 600 degrees C. The initial stages of nitride formation and the effects of surface bombardment by hydrogen plasma species, as well as the effect of treatment current density on the surface morphology, were investigated in detail. The results show that in the pearlitic region carbides are removed during treatment in hydrogen plasma and that the current density influences the surface morphology significantly. A porous surface formed in a 1-minute treatment under high current density (8 mA/cm(2)), whereas a lower current density (2.4 mA/cm(2)) resulted in a highly stressed surface attributed to uneven thermal gradients. Iron nitrides were identified on the surface in either set of conditions. A pure epsilon compound layer was obtained by plasma nitrocarburizing for 6 hours and quenching. The pores in this layer are discussed in view of the 1-minute treatment results and are also compared to those observed in a nitriding treatment. The lack of carbon species in the nitriding plasma results in different mechanisms for pore formation and growth during the treatment. These results are discussed in view of current models for plasma nitriding and gas nitrocarburizing.

However, progress of Li2S cathode has been plagued by its intrinsic drawbacks, including high activation potentials, poor rate performance, and rapid capacity fading during long cycling. Herein, a series of Li2S/transition metal (TM) nanocomposites are synthesized via a lithiothermic reduction reaction, and it is realized that the presence of TMs in Li2S matrix can transform electrochemical behaviors of Li2S. On the one hand, the incorporation of W, Mo, or Ti greatly increases electronic and ionic conductivity of Li2S composites and inhibits the polysulfide dissolution via the TM-S bond, effectively addressing the drawbacks of Li2S cathodes. In particular, Li2S/W and Li2S/Mo exhibit the highest ionic conductivity of solid-phase Li-ion conductors ever-reported: 5.44 x 10(-2)and 3.62 x 10(-2)S m(-1), respectively. On the other hand, integrating Co, Mn, and Zn turns Li2S into a prelithiation agent, forming metal sulfides rather than S(8)after the full charge. These interesting findings may shed light on the design of Li2S-based cathode materials.

Ab initio calculations were performed to determine beta(12)-borophene's applicability as a Li-S battery cathode material. Binding energies of sulphur (S-8) and various lithium polysulphides (Li2Sx, x=2,3,4,6,8) on the beta(12)-borophene surface were calculated, along with the diffusion barriers for Li2S6 and Li2S4. Our calculations suggest a moderate adsorption of sulphur and a strong adsorption of all lithium polysulphides, implying beta(12)-borophene would sufficiently inhibit the dissolution of lithium polysulphides into the electrolyte, preventing the "shuttle effect". Through an exhaustive adsorption site sampling the binding energies were determined to be -1.19 eV for S-8, -2.98 eV for Li2S8, -2.77 eV for Li2S6, -3.08 eV for Li2S4, -3.48 eV for Li2S3, -3.79 eV for Li2S2, and -4.57 eV for Li2S. The diffusion barriers for Li2S6 and Li2S4 were determined to be moderate, ensuring efficient diffusion, with the lowest diffusion energy barriers being 0.61 eV and 0.99 eV for Li2S6 and Li2S4, respectively. The strong binding energies and moderate diffusion barriers suggest beta(12)-borophene would be an excellent lithium polysulphide immobilizer in Li-S cathodes.

Herein, a well-defined structure was achieved by confining catalytically active but unstable sulfur-containing iron species within S/N co-doped porous carbon (Fe-S@SNC) through a simple pyrolysis route. The hierarchically porous and highly conductive carbon host not only provided abundant exposed active sites and fast mass/electron-transfer, but also prohibited the aggregation of iron composites during catalysis. The synergistic effects of confined iron nano-composites and heteroatoms (S/N) significantly elevated the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). As a result, the Fe-S@SNC/PMS system exhibited excellent catalytic degradation performance for various contaminants including dyes, phenolic compounds, and antibiotics. Importantly, a low iron leaching was detected during usage due to the nano-confinement effect of carbon layers, and therefore solves the long-term issue of secondary pollution caused by metal leaching. Furthermore, the underlying degradation mechanism of Fe-S@SNC/PMS system was systematically investigated by radical quenching tests, EPR analysis, and chronoamperometry experiments. It was found that the superoxide anion radical (O-2(center dot-)) was the predominant free radicals that contributed to the radical oxidation of organic pollutants, while the electron transfer mediation on Fe-S@SNC resulted in the non-radical oxidation. Additionally, the LC-MS results coupled with time-dependent HPLC spectra validated that the degradation efficiency and intermediate products were significantly dependent on solution pH and background species. This work provides new insight into the design and activation mechanism of iron-based PMS activators.

The effect of typhoon on particulate organic carbon flux in the southern East China Sea	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							CHLOROPHYLL-A; PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS; TROPICAL CYCLONE; KUROSHIO WATERS; SURFACE WATERS; OCEAN; ENHANCEMENT; TAIWAN; EXPORT; PRODUCTIVITY	Severe tropical storms play an important role in triggering phytoplankton blooms, but the extent to which such storms influence biogenic carbon flux from the euphotic zone is unclear. In 2008, typhoon Fengwong provided a unique opportunity to study the in situ biological responses including phytoplankton blooms and particulate organic carbon fluxes associated with a severe storm in the southern East China Sea (SECS). After passage of the typhoon, the sea surface temperature (SST) in the SECS was markedly cooler (similar to 25 to 26 degrees C) than before typhoon passage (similar to 28 to 29 degrees C). The POC flux 5 days after passage of the typhoon was 265 +/- 14 mg Cm-2 d(-1), which was similar to 1.7-fold that (140-180 mg Cm-2 d(-1)) recorded during a period (June-August, 2007) when no typhoons occurred. A somewhat smaller but nevertheless significant increase in POC flux (224-225 mg Cm-2 d(-1)) was detected following typhoon Sinlaku which occurred approximately 1 month after typhoon Fengwong, indicating that typhoon events can increase biogenic carbon flux efficiency in the SECS. Remarkably, phytoplankton uptake accounted for only about 5% of the nitrate injected into the euphotic zone by typhoon Fengwong. It is likely that phytoplankton population growth was constrained by a combination of light limitation and grazing pressure. Modeled estimates of new/export production were remarkably consistent with the average of new and export production following typhoon Fengwong. The same model suggested that during non-typhoon conditions approximately half of the export of organic carbon occurs via convective mixing of dissolved organic carbon, a conclusion consistent with earlier work at comparable latitudes in the open ocean.

Stable carbon isotopic ratios and ionic composition of the high-Arctic aerosols: An increase in delta C-13 values from winter to spring	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							POLAR SUNRISE EXPERIMENT; PARTICULATE ORGANIC-CARBON; UNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS; LONG-TERM TRENDS; DICARBOXYLIC-ACIDS; ALERT 2000; SEA-ICE; TROPHIC RELATIONSHIPS; MARINE ATMOSPHERE; MATTER	Atmospheric particles were collected in the high Arctic at Alert during winter (February) and spring (April-May) and were subjected to stable carbon isotopic (delta C-13) measurements to better understand the source of carbonaceous aerosols. The mean delta C-13 values of aerosol total carbon (TC) were observed to increase from winter (-25.7 +/- 0.7%) to spring (-23.7 +/- 0.8%). A strong correlation (r(2) = 0.92, p < 0.001) was found between the delta C-13 values and Na+/TC ratios. The increased delta C-13 values were most likely explained by an enhanced sea-to-air emission of marine organic matter to the high Arctic and also by a decreased atmospheric transport of anthropogenic carbon from the midlatitudes. The backward trajectory analysis together with inorganic ion analysis indicated that spring aerosols were more affected by the Arctic Ocean than winter aerosols that were mainly derived from the primary pollutants emitted in the midlatitudes. On the basis of the delta C-13 values and Na+/TC ratios, contribution of marine organic matter to aerosol TC was estimated to be 45% in late spring. The enhanced sea-to-air emission of marine organic carbon is probably linked with a melting of sea ice, expansion of leads, and increased biological activity in the Arctic Ocean after the polar sunrise in spring.

The C-mcms exhibits an excellent capacity of about 1055 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 500 mA g(-1) after 150 cycles without detectable decay, and high-rate capability, which is superior to other similar composites without the carbon core or the carbon shell. The results indicate the structural effect on the enhancement of the electrochemical properties: the SiO2 nanoparticles are completely confined between the carbon shell and the carbon core; the two carbon parts work together to keep the structural integrity and to keep the electrode highly conductive and active during cycling, which guarantees high capacity and cycle stability; the interior pores and voids among the SiO2 nanoparticles can provide free space to accommodate the volume change and buffer the volume effect of the electrode during lithiation/delithiation.

AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; WHEAT CROPPING SYSTEM; ORGANIC-CARBON; LONG-TERM; MAIZE YIELD; GRAIN-YIELD; INORGANIC FERTILIZERS; ROTATIONAL TILLAGE; MANAGEMENT INDEX; MULCHING IMPACTS	Returning the crop residues has been documented to increase soil carbon storage. However, the impacts of different straw return strategies on soil C fractions and sustainable crop productivity are not fully understood. Here, we investigated the impact of different residue management systems on grain yields, SOC sequestration, and soil C fractions in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping system over 6 yr. The straw return strategies included no straw return (CK), conventional wheat straw return (WC), modified wheat straw return (WM), conventional maize straw return (MC), modified maize straw return (MM), conventional straw return for both wheat and maize (WC+MC), and modified straw return for both wheat and maize (WM+MM). The annual average grain yields of maize and wheat when compared to crop residue removal were increased by 32.5 and 50.5% than when the wheat straw and corn stover was not harvested, respectively. Compared to the initial value, the SOC stock increased over a 6 yr by 16.4% period when the wheat straw and corn stover was not harvested. The concentrations of microbial biomass C, very labile C, labile C, KMnO4-oxidizable C, and C management index were increased by returning the crop residue. Overall, the results suggested that the integrated and modified return strategy of both wheat and maize straw is an optimal way of sustainable crop production under the intensive wheat-maize double cropping rotation in the North-central Plain of China.

The Au-paper electrode was constructed through the growth of a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) layer on the back of the paper working electrode to improve the electron conduction. Fe3O4@AuNP nanocomposites were used as labels of luminol, glucose oxidase (GOx) and signal aptamer which greatly enhanced the chemiluminescence emission and provided a simple magnetic separation approach to attain interference-free measurement for real detection. GOx was used for the oxidation of glucose to produce H2O2 which was not only used as the co-reactant in the CL system, but also as the electron donors to suppress the corrosion of SnO2 ODs under illumination as well as to facilitate the generation of stable photocurrent. A PSC was constructed and integrated into a PPECD as an effective electrical energy storage unit to collect and store the photocurrents. The stored electrical energy could be released instantaneously through a low cost, portable, and simple DMM to obtain an amplified current for the quantification of ATP.

The application of a national soil spectral library to local SOC estimations usually requires soil type information, because the relationships between vis-NIR spectra and SOC from different populations may vary. Using 515 samples of five soil types (genetic soil classification of China, GSCC) from the Chinese soil spectral library (CSSL), we compared three strategies in the vis-NIR estimation of SOC. Different regression models were calibrated using the entire dataset (Strategy I, without using soil type as ancillary data) and the subsets stratified by soil type from CSSL as ancillary data (strategies II and III). In Strategy II, the subsets were stratified by soil type from the CSSL for validation. In Strategy III, the subsets were stratified by spectrally derived soil type for validation. The results showed that 86.72% of the samples were successfully discriminated for the soil types by using the vis-NIR spectra. The coefficients of determination in the prediction (R-p(2)) of SOC estimation by strategies I, II, and III were 0.74, 0.83, and 0.82, respectively. The stratified calibration strategies (strategies II and III) improved the vis-NIR estimation of SOC. The misclassification of the soil type in the application of Strategy III slightly affected the SOC estimations. Nevertheless, this strategy is inexpensive and beneficial when expert knowledge on soil classification is lacking. We concluded that vis-NIR spectroscopy could be applied to distinguish some soil types in terms of GSCC, which further provided essential and easily accessible ancillary data for the application of stratified calibration strategies in the vis-NIR estimation of SOC.

Since the IPS cells' growth and differentiation can be manipulated by different physical and chemicals cues, scaffolds combining the beneficial nanostructures and extracellular matrix may become an ideal interface to promote IPS cells' neural differentiation. In this work, a biocompatible and multivalent polyanion, hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate, is used to modify the graphene oxide to obtain bio-adhesive 2D nanosheets. After coating electrospinning nanofibers, the 2D nanosheets-functionalized nanofibrous scaffolds are applied to mediate the proliferation, lineage specification, and neural differentiation of IPS cells. The results suggest that the modified scaffolds can improve the adhesion and proliferation of IPS cells combined with high efficiency in maintaining their stemness. During the neural differentiation process, the scaffolds can promote neural differentiation and their maturity, meanwhile decreasing the lineage specification toward astrocyte. Overall, this study not only provides new multivalent/bio-adhesive nanofibrous scaffolds that integrate the chemical and physical cues to facilitate the targeted neural differentiation of IPS cells but also presents a novel pathway for the fabrication of carbon nanomaterials-based biocomposites in regenerative therapies.

The silver nanotrees with single crystalline (111) faces were synthesized without any external reducing or stabilizing agents in water media, involving a galvanic-cell mechanism between the silver nanostructure and biomass-derived monolithic activated carbon (MAC). By varying the concentration of [Ag(NH3)(2)]NO3, silver nanoflowers, nanowires and nanorods can also be selectively obtained. The silver morphology can also be tuned by some anions such as PO43-, Cl- and OH- in MAC, which afford a more flexible morphological control in this galvanic-cell mechanism than those reported previously. Importantly, the obtained silver dendrites are found to yield excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitroaniline by borohydride.

Nonetheless, due to the intrinsic inertness of CO2 at ambient conditions, the electrocarboxylation efficiency has been quite limited, typically with high applied potentials and low current densities. In this work, we demonstrate that nitrogen-coordinated single-atomic copper sites on carbon framework (Cu/N-C) served as an excellent electrocatalyst for electrocarboxylation of styrene with CO2. The Cu/N-C catalyst allowed to efficiently activate CO2, followed by nucleophilic attack to carboxylate styrene to produce phenylsuccinic acid, thus leading the reaction toward the CO2 activation pathway. The enhanced CO2 activation capability enabled increased selectivity and activity for electrocarboxylation of styrene. The Faradaic efficiency of electrocarboxylation was 92%, suggesting most of the activated CO2 proceeded to react with styrene rather than direct reduction to CO or CH4. The electrocarboxylation exhibited almost 100% product selectivity toward phenylsuccinic acid, with a high partial current density of 58 mA.cm(-2) at -2.2 V (vs. Ag/AgI), corresponding to an outstanding production rate of 216 mg.cm(-2).h(-1), substantially exceeding previously reported works. Our work suggests an exciting perspective in electrocarboxylation of olefins by rational design of CO2 activation electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, it suffers from an inferior electric conductivity and a substantial volume change during Li+ insertion/extraction. By using a facile hydrothermal method, a flexible free-standing MoS2 electrode has here been fabricated onto a carbon cloth substrate. The grafting of ultrathin MoS2 nanoflakes onto the carbon cloth framework (forming CC@MoS2), was shown to facilitate an improved electron transport, as well as an enhanced Li+ transport. As expected, the as-obtained CC@MoS2 electrode was observed to exhibit an excellent lithium storage performance. It delivers a high discharge specific capacity of 2.42 mA h cm(-2) at 0.7 mA cm(-2) (even after 100 cycles), which is an impressive result.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR) combined with conversion rate of epoxide groups tests was applied to characterize the chemical composition of the polymeric emulsifier. The emulsion sizing based on the self-made polymeric emulsifier was prepared through phase inversion emulsification method. The stability of the sizing agent was evaluated by centrifugal sedimentation and particle size investigations. The surface morphology of CF was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The effects of the sizing agent on CF handleability were examined by abrasion resistance, hairiness amount and stiffness tests. The results indicated that after sizing, the CF obtained an appreciable enhancement in handleability. Finally, interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of sized CF/epoxy resin composite increased by 55.39% compared with that of the desized one.

The as-prepared samples were characterized in detail by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, new high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscopy, specific surface areas analysis, UV-Vis diffused reflectance spectrum, photoluminescence spectrum, and thermal analysis. The structural characterization results reveal that the as-prepared CN-MCA has the same chemical structure as CN-M, but appears as microspheres with nanoporous surfaces. Compared to the CN-M, CN-MCA microspheres exhibit higher specific surface areas, stronger optical absorption and lower PL intensity, which allow more active sites, more effective visible-light harvesting and more efficient migration rate of photogenerated charge. Consequently, we observed that CN-MCA microspheres exhibit higher photocatalytic activity in the photodegradation of tetracycline hydrochloride under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the degradation efficiency of tetracycline hydrochloric acid under 2 h of visible light irradiation was 80.54% when the dosage of CN-MCA was 1.0 g/L; the initial concentration of the tetracycline hydrochloride solution was 10 mg/L; and the initial pH was 7.

Compared with the atomic carbon layer of graphene, these emerging 2D materials usually consist of multiple elements, which thus makes the materials show higher versatility, better functionality, and greater adjustability for a diversity of applications. Currently, the emerging 2D materials have been widely studied as nanoplatforms for drug/gene delivery vehicles, cancer therapy, bioimaging, biosensors, etc. In the present review, we will provide fresh insights into the rapid developments of these emerging 2D materials for the applications in bioelectronics and biosensors. The most representative applications of using emerging 2D materials in skin bioelectronics, biosensing devices, and neural interfaces will be briefly summarized. The future outlooks and new challenges in these fields will also be concluded, which may inspire many new opportunities across the bioelectronic fields.

Although graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been widely studied as a star photocatalyst for CO2 reduction, the extremely fast charge recombination rate seriously limits its performance. Loading suitable co-catalysts to construct an effective junction is considered an efficient way to solve this issue and promote photocatalytic performance. In this work, metallic molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) is dispersed on g-C3N4 nanosheets to construct a Schottky junction photocatalyst. The Schottky junction between MoO2 and g-C3N4 induces efficient charge separation and transfer. As a result, the optimal MoO2/g-C3N4 Schottky junction photocatalyst exhibits a 15 times higher CH4 yield and five times higher CO yield compared with pure g-C3N4. This article provides a new route to construct a Schottky junction for boosting photocatalytic activity.

The armchair (n, n) SWNTs (n = 3-12) and zigzag (n, 0) SWNTs (n = 4-12) were thoroughly examined. We found that the most stable amino acid/SWNT complexes for different SWNTs have similar local structures, and that the distance between the amino acid and SWNT is about 3 angstrom. Owing to the pi-pi and H-pi stacking interactions, the benzene and indole rings are not exactly parallel to the SWNTs but instead lie at a small angle. We also investigated the diameter and chirality dependences of binding energies and found that SWNT (5, 0) has an especially large binding energy that can be used for SWNT identification or selection.

Enhancement mechanism of field electron emission properties in hybrid carbon nanotubes with tree- and wing-like features	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Branch; Density; Graphitic sheets; RF-PECVD	GROWTH; NANOPARTICLES	In this work, the tree-like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with branches of different diameters and the wing-like CNTs with graphitic-sheets of different densities were synthesized by using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The nanostructures of the as-prepared hybrid carbon materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The structural dependence of field electron emission (FEE) property was also investigated. It is found that both of the tree- and wing-like CNTs exhibit a lower turn-on field and higher emission current density than the pristine CNTs, which can be ascribed to the effects of branch size, crystal orientation, and graphitic-sheet density.

However, previous approaches for fabricating CNT probes are complex and poorly controlled. In this paper, we introduce a simple method to selectively fabricate a single CNT on an AFM tip by controlling the trigger threshold to adjust the amount of growth solution attached to the tip. The yield rate is over 93%. The resulting CNT probes are suitable in length, without the need for a subsequent cutting process. We used the CNT probe to scan the complex nanostructure with a high aspect ratio, thereby solving the long-lasting problem of mapping complex nanostructures.

Flexible sensors, as a kind of indispensable components of flexible electronics, have been extensively studied. However, wearable airflow sensors capable of monitoring the environment airflow in real time are rarely reported. Herein, by mimicking the spider's fluff, an ultrasensitive and flexible all-textile airflow sensor based on fabric with in situ grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed. The fabric decorated with fluffy-like CNTs possesses exceptionally large contact area, endowing the airflow sensor with superior properties including ultralow detection limit (approximate to 0.05 m s(-1)), multiangle airflow differential response (0 degrees-90 degrees), and fast response time (approximate to 1.3 s). Besides, the fluffy fabric airflow sensor can be combined with a pristine fabric airflow sensor to realize highly sensitive detection in a wide airflow range (0.05-7.0 m s(-1)). Its potential applications including transmitting information according to Morse code by blowing the sensors, monitoring increasing and decreasing airflow velocity, and alerting blind people walking outside about potential hazard induced by nearby fast-moving objects are demonstrated. Furthermore, the airflow sensor can be directly integrated into clothing as stylish designs without sacrificing comfortness. It is believed that the ultrasensitive all-textile airflow sensor holds great promise for applications in smart textiles and wearable electronics.

Herein, a fascinating sulfur cathode based on sulfide graphdiyne (SGDY) is designed with a unique structure, which is composed of a conducting carbon skeleton with high Li+ mobility and short sulfur energy-storing unites. The SGDY cathode can essentially avoid polysulfide dissolution and be compatible with commercially available carbonate-based electrolytes and Grignard reagent-based electrolytes (all phenyl complex (APC) type electrolytes). Both the assembled Li-S and Mg-S batteries exhibit excellent electrochemical performances including large capacity, superior rate capability, high capacity retention, and high Coulombic efficiency.

NiFeP nanoflakes composite with CoP on carbon cloth as flexible and durable electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						phosphorus doping; flexible electrode; abundant elements; bifunctional electrocatalyst; water splitting	HYDROGEN EVOLUTION REACTION; NI2P NANOSHEET ARRAY; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; DOPED CARBON; NANOPARTICLES; PERFORMANCE; GRAPHENE; HETEROSTRUCTURES; HYDROXIDE; FOAM	High-performance and earth-abundant NiFeP is an excellent bifunctional catalyst for water splitting in acidic and alkaline environments, and NiFeP nanoflakes on CoP layer composite with a conductive carbon cloth (CC) substrate as the trunk-leaf flexible structure (NiFeP/CoP/CC) is prepared by direct high-temperature phosphorization. Overpotentials of only 96.38 and 78.80 mV are required in hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, to generate an electrocatalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2). A small Tafel slope of 70.67 and 63.21 mV per decade are also observed from NiFeP/CoP/CC revealing a Volmer- Heyrovsky mechanism in both media. The electrocatalyst also delivers excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance in the alkaline environment and long-term electrochemical durability for at least 24 h in electrolytes over a wide pH range. A device is assembled with two identical flexible ultrathin NiFeP/CoP/CC as both the anode and cathode in 1 M KOH driven by a set of 1.6 V solar cells. During 32 h of electrolysis, the results show that the current of our electrodes maintains 80% performance at a constant voltage of 1.7 V for 32 h, and the NiFeP/CoP/CC anodes and cathodes have large potential in industrial alkaline water splitting.

The grain size is about 15 nm in the top surface layer, and it increases with an increase of depth from the treated surface. Nanoindentation measurements indicated that hardness is enhanced in the nc surface layer relative to the matrix. Experiments show that the friction coefficient decreases and the wear resistance increases with the nc surface layer. The improvement in friction and wear properties may be attributed to the harder nc surface layer which reduces the degree of plowing and micro-cutting under the lower load and the degree of plastic removal and surface fatigue fracture under the higher load, respectively.

However, undetermined soil organic carbon (SOC) enrichment in aeolian sediment limits the accurate estimation of SOC loss induced by wind erosion. Herein, we examined wind erosion and SOC loss measurements in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. By testing the particle size distributions (PSDs) and SOC contents across different particle size groups of the soil samples and aeolian sediments, we found that the finer soil particles generally had higher SOC contents. According to the measured results, we recognized that the mechanism of SOC enrichment in aeolian sediment is the inconstant distribution of SOC across the different soil particle size groups and the differences between the PSDs of soils and aeolian sediments. Based on the mechanism, we proposed a method to calculate the SOC content in aeolian sediment, and the calculated results are highly consistent with the measured results. Compared with the previous method, our calculation method provided a more precise result. Integrating our method for estimating SOC content in dust (diameter less than 50 mu m) and a dust emission model, we simulated the SOC loss induced by wind erosion in this region by a wind erosion model, and the results show SOC loss induced by dust emissions ranging from 0 to 39 g/m(2)/y during the period of 2001 to 2017. We believe the study method of dust SOC content calculation we proposed could be interested by the scholars in the field of carbon cycling, and the simulated results of SOC loss could provide robust data for the estimation of carbon budget in the desert steppe.

The obtained results (inductively-coupled plasmaspectrometry and cyclic voltammetry) show that the reduction ability of CFCNTs with 5 nm diameter (CFCNT5) is stronger than that of CFCNTs with 15 nm diameter (CFCNT15). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest that a more negative charge distribution exists on CFCNT5, which makes it a better electron donor to PdCl4-2.

Continuous fibre composite 3D printing with pultruded carbon/PA6 commingled fibres: Processing and mechanical properties	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Carbon fibre; Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs); Mechanical properties; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing	POLYMER COMPOSITES; TENSILE PROPERTIES; MATERIAL EXTRUSION; FABRICATION; PERFORMANCE; IMPREGNATION; PREFORM; GLASS; SIZE	Continuous Fibre composite 3D printing (CF-3DP) technology is a newly developed Additive Manufacturing (AM) process. By employing continuous fibre as a reinforcement for the composite, the mechanical properties of the 3D printed part can be significantly improved. However, owing to the process's early stage of development, the mechanical performance of the printed material is still unable to compete with composites produced using conventional manufacturing processes. This can manly be attributed to lower fibre volume fractions and/or higher void content. The grand objective of the research project is to establish a demonstrator of practical applications, and in this paper, preparatory developments were carried out to pave the ground for the subsequent developments, including feedstock materials development, printing process development, and materials properties evaluation. Efforts has been made to increase fibre volume fracture, to reduce voids contents, to evaluate effective properties systematically. The static mechanical test results showed relatively good longitudinal tensile properties while matrix sensitive properties were low, as to be expected in UD composites with a relatively weak matrix material. The advantage of CF-3DP is to achieve fibre steering, and the steered fibre design can be achieved by the current process to realize novel composite structures in future study.

Meanwhile, three-dimensional graphene networks (3DGNs) are employed to provide a fast transport channel for photo-induced electrons. The morphology is analyzed by SEM, TEM, XRD and Raman spectrum, and the photovoltaic performances are recorded to reveal the specific functions of MOF and 3DGNs. The synergy between MOF, 3DGNs and TiO2 is achieved by adjusting their mass fraction. Moreover, the average size of MOF exerts a significant influence on the resulting properties resulting from the scattering ability to incident light. After corresponding optimizing, the short circuit current, open circuit voltaic, fill factor and energy conversion efficiency reach 20.5 mAcm(-2), 680 mV, 0.619% and 8.63%.

Here, a novel p-toluenesulfonic acid assisted mechanochemical approach is used to prepare a silicatemplated bipyridine-containing covalent organic framework (COF), which can be further converted into an iron nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (mC-TpBpy-Fe) upon carbonization and template removal. The resulting mC-TpBpy-Fe exhibits a large pore volume and surface area, which significantly promote the mass transfer efficiency and increase the accessibility of the active sites, yielding a high ORR activity with a competitive half-wave potential of 0.845 V and limiting current density of 5.92 mA/cm(2) (vs 0.852 V and 5.57 mA/cm(2) for Pt/C). Application of this COF derived mesoporous carbon within a Zn-air battery revealed that it can operate in ambient conditions with a competitive discharge performance, showing its potential for practical applications.

However, low coulombic efficiency and the formation of Li dendrites cause challenges in short cycle life and safety issues, highlighting a need for an innovative design of lithium metal anode with high areal capacity, high rate capability and high safety. Herein, we demonstrate a nanostructured lithium metal anode with stable solid electrolyte interface achieved by electro-deposition of Li metal in a commercial carbon fiber cloth matrix. The as-obtained composite Li metal anode with a high areal capacity of 10 mA h cm(-2) can mitigate volume expansion and suppress the formation of dendrites effectively, which cycle in both ether and ester electrolyte with high current density and large capacity, showing an exceptionally low overpotential of 18 mV and stable cycle over 350 cycles. A full cell with LiFePO4 cathode can stable cycle at 10 C for 200 cycles with only 5.6% capacity fading, and the general applicability also demonstrated by full cell paired with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2.

Results of carbon ion radiotherapy for skin carcinomas in 45 patients	BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							EXTRAMAMMARY PAGETS-DISEASE; MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; BASAL-CELL; PROTON RADIOTHERAPY; RADIATION-THERAPY; CANCER; IRRADIATION; MANAGEMENT; SURGERY; OPTIONS	Background Heavy ions represent the best tool for external radiotherapy (RT) of inoperable tumours. Heavy ion RT has been used in the treatment of various tumours, especially for radioresistant tumours mediated by hypoxia, localized near organs at risk. Most of these treatments are concentrated in deep-seated tumours such as those of the brain, head, lung, liver, rectum and urogenital organs, and treatment of skin carcinomas is limited. Objectives To evaluate the outcome and toxicity after carbon ion RT for skin carcinomas at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou, China. Methods Between November 2006 and March 2009, 45 patients with skin carcinoma [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 16), basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (n = 12), malignant melanoma (MM) (n = 7), Bowen disease (n = 8) and Paget disease (n = 2)] were treated with carbon ion RT within a clinical Phase I trial. Patients received total doses of 60-70 GyE for SCC and BCC, 61-75 GyE for MM, 60 GyE for Bowen disease and 42 5 GyE for Paget disease, administered in 6-11 fractions over 6-11 days, with a fraction dose of 7-10 GyE. Results The mean follow-up was 24 months, range 12-36 months. The actuarial local control rates at 1 and 3 years were 90.9% and 65.5% for SCC, 91.7% and 80.2% for BCC, 85.7% and 42.9% for MM, 90% and 90% for Bowen and Paget diseases, respectively. The actuarial 1- and 3-year overall survival rates for 45 patients were 88 9% and 86%, respectively. No severe side-effects greater than Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3 have been observed. Conclusions The results demonstrated that heavy ion RT offers high local tumour control and progression-free survival rates without significant radiation-induced toxicity for patients with skin carcinomas.

Compressed CO2 acts as both a physiochemical additive and a reagent to produce an acid catalyst in the synthesis. This new one-pot assembly approach can efficiently adjust the porous characteristics of OMC by employing different amounts of compressed CO2, and the self-assembly mechanism is proposed. The spherical micelles formed by triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 serve as a structure-directing agent for the controllable synthesis of nanomaterials. Resorcinol/phloroglucinol and formaldehyde are used as carbon-yielding components. It was found that CO2 can penetrate into the hydrocarbon-chain region of the F127 micelles, leading to template swelling and influencing the properties of OMC. The surfactant and precursors attracted by H-bonding interactions self-assemble and produce OMC after polymerization and carbonization. The resulting OMC as a supercapacitor electrode material exhibits outstanding specific capacitances, and the electrochemical performances change as the structural properties are varied.

The effects of carbon-nitrogen ratio on the acid production and activity of cytosolic fumarase were investigated. Under nitrogen limitation stress, the cytosolic fumarase could keep high activity. With the urea concentration decreased from 2.0 to 0.1 g l(-1), the cytosolic fumarase activity increased by 300% and the production of fumaric acid increased from 14.4 to 40.3 g l(-1) and l-malic acid decreased from 2.1 to 0.3 g l(-1). Cytosolic fumarase could be inhibited by substrate analog 3-hydroxybutyric acid. With the addition of 3-hydroxybutyric acid (50 mM) in the fermentation culture, fumaric acid production decreased from 40.3 to 14.1 g l(-1) and l-malic acid increased from 0.3 to 5.4 g l(-1).

Molecular Insights into Carbon Nanotube Supercapacitors: Capacitance Independent of Voltage and Temperature	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ELECTRICAL DOUBLE-LAYER; DIFFERENTIAL CAPACITANCE; IONIC LIQUIDS; DYNAMICS SIMULATION; INTERFACE; STORAGE; SIZE	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of supercapacitors with single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) electrodes in room-temperature ionic liquids were performed to investigate the influences of the applied electrical potential, the radius/curvature of SWCNTs, and temperature on their capacitive behavior. It is found that (1) SWCNTs-based supercapacitors exhibit a near-flat capacitance-potential curve, (2) the capacitance increases as the tube radius decreases, and (3) the capacitance depends little on the temperature. We report the first MD study showing the influence of the electrode curvature on the capacitance-potential curve and negligible dependence of temperature on capacitance of tubular electrode. The latter is in good agreement with recent experimental findings and is attributed to the similarity of the electrical double layer (EDL) microstructure with temperature varying from 260 to 400 K. The electrode curvature effect is explained by the dominance of charge overscreening and increased ion density per unit area of electrode surface.

Here, we report on an aqueous-solution-based approach for the synthesis of Sb2S3 films from easily accessible Sb2O3 as antimony source. In this reaction, 3-mercaptopropionic acid was applied as both solvent and sulfur precursor, aqueous ammonia was employed as a solvent. After simple annealing at a temperature as low as 270 degrees C, the spin-coated precursor solution can generate compact, flat, uniform, and well-crystallized Sb2S3 film. Mechanistic study showed that the formation of Sb-complex with ammonium carboxylates leads to the successful dissolution of Sb2O3 powder. A suitable annealing process was able to generate carbon-free Sb2S3 films. Planar heterojunction solar cell based on the as-prepared Sb2S3 film delivered a power conversion efficiency of 5.57%, which is the highest efficiency of solution-processed planar heterojunction Sb2S3 solar cells and a high value in all kinds of Sb2S3 solar cells. This research provides a convenient approach for the fabrication of device-quality Sb2S3 films, and highlights solution processing of carbon-free metal chalcogenide thin films as a suitable process for application in optoelectronic devices.

The conversion of carbon sources into gamma-PGA was analyzed with the C-13-NMR method after enriching the media with C-13-labeled glucose. The results showed that the percentage of gamma-PGA monomers derived from glucose was relatively low, approximately 6% and 9%, respectively, with an initial glucose concentration of 30 and 40 g L-1. It was concluded that glucose was utilized mainly as the growth-limiting substrate for cell growth and supplied the required energy during gamma-PGA biosynthesis, while L-glutamate was preferred as the main substrate for gamma- PGA formation. To achieve an efficient conversion of L-glutamate and enhance the gamma-PGA production, a fed-batch culture was proposed by feeding of glucose. By this method, supplied L-glutamate (40 g L-1) was completely depleted, and gamma-PGA yield was attained 42 g L-1.

However, the low-energy density and high-cost of the reported cathode materials hinder their further development. Herein, a Se-based 6-electron Al-Se battery was generated by activating the highly reversible Se(-II)/Se(0) couple into Se(0)/Se(IV) couple in AlCl3-based ionic liquid electrolyte, which exhibited an ultra-high theoretical specific capacity (2036 mAh g(-1)). For further activating the Se cathode and addressing the shuttle effect of the soluble products, the Se/graphene aerogel (Se/GA) and carbon-based modified separator with oxygen-containing functional groups (O-CNT) were collectively employed to promote stable high-energy density for Al-Se battery. Consequently, GA improved the utilization of Se cathode and reduced its overpotential, delivering super-high specific capacity with a sufficient voltage discharge plateau at au. 1.9 V. However, the O-CNT separator effectively blocked these Se-based cationic clusters, such as Se-n(2+) and SeCl3+, by a dual defense mechanism that integrated the physical barrier of porous structure and powerful chemical adsorption ability of the carboxyl (-COOH) group. Then, a high energy density of 1957 Wh kg(-1) (1599 mAh g(-1)) was delivered at 100 mA g(-1) and 624 Wh kg(-1) (580 mAh g(-1)) at 1000 mA g(-1). Furthermore, the Al-Se battery exhibited outstanding cycling performance of 421 Wh kg(-1) (395 mAh g(-1)) at 1000 mA g(-1) after 200 cycles with the record-setting cyclic performance achieved in the documented AIBs. These results provide useful insight into and a versatile strategy for boosting the performance of Al-Se battery.

In this work, we report an effective approach to enhance anti-wear of thermosetting polyimide (TPI) by filling with g-C3N4 under high temperature. TPI composite (TPT-1) and g-C3N4 were firstly prepared. Then, friction and wear behavior of TPT-1 was studied and comparatively evaluated with neat resin from room temperature to 350 degrees C. As a result, the wear resistance of TPI was able to significantly improve and an much lower wear rate (7.29 x 10(-7) mm(3)/N m) was achieved at 350 degrees C. Moreover, mechanism of friction and wear was demonstrated that transfer film formed by introducing g-C3N4 with high E-modulus and hardness could effectively share the load with TPI and prevent from further abrasion of resin in contact surfaces. This work could help researchers to design a new TPI tribo-material used at high temperature.

Then, the modified F-51 was mixed with poly(alkylene glycol allyl glycidyl ether) as a film former of a sizing agent. A series of water-soluble sizing agents for carbon fiber (CF) were prepared. The modified F-51 was analyzed by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy. The surface morphology of the CF was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The effects of the sizing agent on the handling characteristics were investigated by abrasion resistance, fluffs, and breakage and stiffness tests. The results show that the abrasion resistance of the sized CF increased by 114.5% and reached 2344 times and the mass of fabric hairiness decreased to 3.2 mg. The interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) test indicated that the interfacial adhesion of the composite could be greatly improved. The ILSS of the sized CF composite could reach a maximum value of 42.40 MPa. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2014, 131, 39843.

Herein, we investigate a representative gamma-Li3PO4-type Li3.5Ge0.75S0.25O4 sintered sample, showing that its GB resistance mostly results from the presence of a residual Li-S-O rich phase produced after liquid-phase sintering and is also influenced by the sintering atmosphere. Finally, the GB resistance of the Li3.5Ge0.75S0.25O4 sintered sample is shown to be effectively reduced by the use of spark plasma sintering, which allows GB formation to occur quickly enough to prevent the formation of excess residual Li-S-O rich phase.

The Stability of Carbonaceous Electrodes in Ether Based Electrolyte Solutions for Advanced Li Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							HARD-CARBON; FLUOROETHYLENE CARBONATE; NEGATIVE ELECTRODES; SURFACE-CHEMISTRY; ANODE MATERIALS; FILM ANODE; ION; PERFORMANCE; INSERTION; CATHODES	In this work we have studied the stability and performance of hard carbon in comparison with petroleum coke (soft carbon) as electrode materials for Li-ion batteries in an ethereal and alkyl carbonate based electrolyte solutions. 1 M bis(triflouromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme)) and a mixture of dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/mono-fluorinated ethylene carbonates (FEC) 4:1 (%v) with 1 M Lithium hexaflourophosphate (LiPF6) where chosen as representative solutions for this study. The motivation for this work is the potential importance of ethereal solutions for high energy density Li-S and Li-O-2 batteries and the possibility of using carbons as an alternative to Li metal anodes in these systems. An acceptable performance of hard carbon electrodes in the ether based solutions was demonstrated. In contrast, soft carbon electrodes which preform very well in alkyl carbonates solutions behave poorly in the ethereal solutions. Their failure mechanism was explored and is explained in this report. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.

The content of trivalent arsenic (As3+) is the highest in flue gas, and its morphological distribution is significantly affected by the flue gas temperature. When the flue gas temperature is lower than 900 K, the As2O3 molecules are dominant in the trigonal bipyramid type. While when the temperature exceeds 900 K, the priority structure of As2O3 is chain type > horn type > trigonal bipyramid type in turn. This paper has verified the feasibility for the adsorption of flue gas arsenic via the unburned carbon in fly ash, and the performance of the zigzag carbon surface is always better than the armchair surface. This paper provides theoretical support for arsenic removal in coal-fired power plants, and also provides some new ideas for the secondary utilization of fly ash and the development of carbon-based arsenic removal adsorbent.

CACs prepared by coal with high ash (6.74%) and volatile matter content (34.31%) showed better adsorption efficiency towards MB (547.35 mg g(-1)) due to higher surface area and pore volume. The effect of coal to activating agent ratio (CAR) was also investigated in a batch reactor. The porosity development is closely related to the CAR. The calculated monolayer adsorption amount (714.29 mg g(-1)) was found on YLC-AC-3 with a surface area of 1212.50 m(2) g(-1). The equilibrium data were favorably described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, and adsorption kinetics fitted well to the pseudo-second order model. The removal efficiency remains at 98.21% after five runs. The results of the present study suggest that CACs are potential and effective adsorbents in fast removal of dyes from aqueous solution.

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time NaSBs using a ferrocene-derived amorphous sulfurized cyclopentadienyl composite (SCC) cathode. Polysulfide dissolution is eliminated via covalent bonding between the insoluble short-chain sulfur species and carbon backbone. Control experiments with a metal-free composite analogue determined that the iron species in the SCC does not have a significant role in polysulfide anchoring. Instead, the superior electrochemical performance is attributed to sulfur covalently bonded to carbon and the uniform nanoparticulate morphology of the SCC composite. In the carbonate-based electrolyte, a discharge capacity of 795 mAh g((S))(-1) was achieved during early cycling at 0.2 C, and high Coulombic efficiencies close to 100% were maintained with capacity retention of 532 and 442 mAh g((S))(-1) after 100 and 200 cycles, respectively.

The electromagnetic coupling between the HGNPs and Au film, and the notable plasmonic fields spread over the inner and outer surfaces of HGNPs, led to the considerable amplification of the SPR signal. Polydopamine-Ag@Fe3O4/reduced graphene oxide (PDA-Ag@ Fe3O4/rGO) was introduced to bind detection antibody (Ab(2)) to form the improved sandwich structure. Ag nanoparticles were excited to produce SPR and their hot electrons were doped on graphene thin films, which amplified the response of biomolecules. Magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4) simplified the collection of Ab(2)-PDA-Ag@Fe3O4/rGO. An external layer of polydopamine (PDA) permitted the efficient immobilization of Ab(2) without activation via abundant functional groups and protected the nanoparticles from etching or agglomeration. In addition, because of its large mass, Ab(2)-PDA-Ag@Fe3O4/rGO also played a key role in the further amplification of the SPR response signals. This novel SPR biosensor exhibited an effective response to the rabbit IgG at the different concentrations ranging from 0.019 to 40.00 mu g mL(-1) This value is 132 times lower than that observed for a traditional SPR biosensor based on Au-3-mercaptopropionic acid and 8 times lower than that obtained from an Ab(2) sandwich assay, which indicates that the SPR sensor has high sensitivity. In addition, the designed biosensor showed satisfactory recoveries to detect the rabbit IgG spiked in serum samples. Therefore, the novel SPR biosensor with high sensitivity and acceptable recovery has potential for practical applications.

The poly-(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA) was applied to neutralize Cd-aptamer via electrostatic interaction. The presence of Cd2+ would trigger Cd-aptamer conformation change causing the Cd/Cd-aptamer complex to adsorb more electrochemical signal indicator [Ru(NH3)(6)](3+) instead of PDDA. Through differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) detection, the peak current increased along with the increase in concentration of Cd2+, and the linear ranges were from 0.001 nM to 100 nM (1.124x10(-13) g/mL to 1.124x10(-8) g/mL) with the detection limit as low as 0.04995 pM (5.614x10(-15) g/mL). The proposed biosensor exhibited good stability, high sensitivity and selectivity towards Cd2+. Furthermore, this Cd-aptamer biosensor was demonstrated in testing Cd2+ in tap water samples with satisfactory results.

Yet, to date, the antibacterial activity of the supported Ag NPs is still far below optimum. This is mainly associated with the easy aggregation of Ag NPs on the supporting materials. Herein, an electron-assisted reduction (EAR) method, which is operated at temperatures as low as room temperature and without using any reduction reagent, was employed for immobilizing highly dispersed Ag NPs on aminated-CNTs (Ag/A-CNTs). The average Ag NPs size on the EAR-prepared Ag/A-CNTs is only 3.8 nm, which is much smaller than that on the Ag/A-CNTs fabricated from the traditional thermal calcination (25.5 nm). Compared with Ag/A-CNTs fabricated from traditional thermal calcination, EAR-prepared Ag/A-CNTs shows a much better antibacterial activity to E. coli/S. aureus and antifouling performance to P. subcordiformis/T. lepidoptera. This is mainly originated from the significantly enhanced Ag+ ion releasing rate and highly dispersed Ag NPs with small size on the EAR-prepared Ag/A-CNTs. The findings from the present work are helpful for fabricating supported Ag NPs with small size and high dispersion for efficient antibacterial process.

However; two.-root problems of Li metal, namely high reactivity and infinite relative volume change' during cycling. bring about numerous other challenges that impede its practical' applica-e tions. Trl the past, extensive studies have targeted-these two causes' by either improving, interfacial' stability or constructing a stable host. However, efficient surface passivation on three-dimensional (3D) Li is still absent. Here, we develop a conformal LiF coating technique on Li surface with commercial Freon R134a as the reagent. In contrast to solid/liquid reagents, gaseous Freon exhibits not only nontoxicity and well-controlled reactivity, but alsb much better permeability that enables a uniform LiF coating even on 3D Li. By applying a LiF coating onto 3D layered. Li-reduced graphene oxide (Li-rGO) electrodes, highly reduced side reactions and enhanced cycling stability without overpotential.auginent fOr.over 200 cycles were proven in symmetric cells. Furthermore, Li-S cells with LiF protected Li-rGO exhibit-significantly improved cyclability and Coulombic efficiency, while excellent rate capability (similar to 800 mAh g(-1) at 2 C) can still be retained.

In this paper, a bond-based peridynamic modeling for unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced polymer material(UD-CFRP) orthogonal cutting process is proposed, and the corresponding composite material bond failure criterion is also investigated for better revealing the machining mechanism of UD-CFRP machining. From comparing between simulation and experimental results, it can be indicated that the peridynamic modeling is capable for predicting the chip formation and surface damages in UD-CFRP machining. The investigation about effect of critical stretch and mass density on the machined surface crack is also conducted.	[Shang, S.; Qin, X. D.; Li, S. P.; Li, H.; Cao, X.

However, the optimal straw-return strategy for economically sustainable grain production in intensive winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summer maize (Zea mays L.) cropping systems remains uncertain. A 4-yr field experiment was conducted in the central North China Plain to determine the effects of straw return on SOC stock and lability, soil enzyme activity, and grain yield, and to further evaluate the sustainability of crop production in intensive wheat-maize double-cropping systems. Four treatments were tested: no straw return (NR), return of wheat straw (WR), return of maize straw (MR), and return of both wheat and maize straw (WR+MR). Compared with the initial value, SOC stocks significantly increased by 2.8, 5.4, and 13.1% in WR, MR, and WR+ MR, respectively, and significantly decreased by 2.9% in NR. Stocks of KMnO4-oxidizable C and microbial biomass C; activities of soil invertase, protease, and dehydrogenase; and the C management index were significantly higher with than without straw return and followed the order NR < WR < MR < WR+MR. Yields of wheat and maize were highest in WR+MR, but economic sustainability was higher in WR and MR relative to NR and WR+MR. Our results indicate that return of either wheat or maize straw is sufficient to maintain SOC levels and may be the optimal strategy for economically sustainable grain production in the central North China Plain.

Using porous carbon (Ketjenblack) additives, coatings with poor adhesion properties and deep cracks were obtained. The morphology is also reflected in the electrochemical behavior under capacity-limited conditions. Mapping the differential capacity versus potential over all cycles yields detailed insights into the degradation processes and shows the onset of cell failure with the emergence of lithium-rich silicon alloys at low potentials, well before capacity fading is observed. Fading occurs faster with electrodes containing PAA binder. The surface area of the electrode components is a major cause of increased irreversible reaction and capacity fade. Synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on aged, uncycled electrodes revealed accelerated conversion of the native SiOx-layer to detrimental SiOxFy in presence of Ketjenblack. In contrast, a conventional carbon black better preserved the SiOx-layer. This effect is attributed to preferred adsorption of binder on high surface area electrode components and highlights the role of binders as 'artificial SEI-layers'. This work demonstrates that optimization of nanocomposites requires careful balancing of the surface areas and amounts of all the electrode components applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The precursor of the absorbent, K-promoted pseudo-boehmite (PB), was synthesized from alumina sol and K2CO3 powder by mixing, aggregating, drying, and aging. Potassium-promoted gamma-alumina was obtained after calcination at 400 degrees C from K-promoted PB. Characteristic crystallines of several stages of products in the synthesis process have been detected by X-ray diffraction. The optimal Al:K ratio in view of CO2 capacity and cyclic performance of K-promoted gamma-alumina was obtained by a thermal gravimetric analyzer. The optimal ratio of K-promoted gamma-alumina showed a capacity of 0.67 mmol/g (dry base) for the first cycle and 0.34 mmol/g (wet base) after 30 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) cycles at 300 degrees C. K-promoted gamma-alumina adsorbent could be favorable for a low energy penalty precombustion CO2 capture application. It showed a variety of advantages such as low adsorption heat, good mechanical strength, low cost in synthesis, and fair stable capacity.

Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-dependent electronic transport of ZBNNRs with edge defects. It is found that the defects could make the system operate as a dual spin filter, where the direction of spin polarization is switched by the defect. Further analysis shows that the transmission eigenchannels for the opposite spins reside spatially separated on opposite edges. The defect on one edge could suppress the transmission for only one spin component, but preserve that for the other spin, resulting in a dual spin filter effect. This effect is found to be unaffected by the width of the ribbon and the length of the defect. Moreover, by constructing defects on both edges, the system exhibits two transmission peaks with opposite spins residing discretely on both sides of the Fermi level, suggesting that an electrically controlled dual spin filter based on ZBNNRs is also realizable. As controllable defects have been experimentally fabricated on monolayer boron nitride [T. Pham, A. L. Gibb, Z. Li, S. M. Gilbert, C. Song, S. G. Louie and A. Zettl, Nano Lett., 2016, 16, 7142-7147], our results may shed light on the development of B/N-based spintronic devices.

In this paper, PdNix-B/carbon nanotubes (PdNix-B/CNTs) (x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9) composites have been prepared by a chemical reduction method in which PdNix-B nanoparticles of approximately 3.5 nm are grown on the surface of carbon nanotubes. A cell was assembled with PdNix-B/CNTs as the anode catalyst, a polymer fibre membrane (PFM) as a substitute for the Nafion membrane and LaNi0(3) as the cathode catalyst. The results show that the Ni element displays an ability to balance the competition between the hydrolysis and oxidation of BH4-. A peak power density of 105 mW cm(-2) (x = 0.9) was achieved at 25 degrees C. However, the highest fuel efficiency of 69% was achieved at x = 03, and the corresponding power density was 87 mW cm(-2), which represents the best comprehensive performance of these DBFCs.

Liquid phase adsorption experiments were conducted, and the maximum adsorption capacity was determined. Various conditions were evaluated, including initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, contact time, solution pH, and temperature. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were used to describe the equilibrium isotherm and to calculate the isotherm constants. It was found that the adsorption capacity of FAC is much higher than those of other types of activated carbons. Maximum equilibrium adsorption capacities of 934.58 and 581.40 mg/g for MO and MB, respectively, were achieved. Three simplified kinetic models, namely, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion equations, were used to investigate the adsorption process. The pseudo-second-order equation was followed for the adsorption of MO and MB on FAC. The temperature dependent adsorption behaviors of MO and MB indicated that the adsorption is a spontaneous and endothermic process accompanying an entropy increases (the driving force for adsorption). This work demonstrates that FAC could be employed as a low cost alternative to commercially available activated carbons in the removal of dyes from wastewater.

However, traditional semiconducting materials suffer from limited hydrogen evolution efficiency owing to low intrinsic electron transfer, rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers, and lack of artificial microstructure. Herein, we report a metal-free half-metallic carbon nitride for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The introduced half-metallic features not only effectively facilitate carrier transfer but also provide more active sites for hydrogen evolution reaction. The nanosheets incorporated into a micro grid mode resonance structure via in situ pyrolysis of ionic liquid, which show further enhanced photoelectronic coupling and entire solar energy exploitation, boosts the hydrogen evolution rate reach up to 1009 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). Our findings propose a strategy for micro-structural regulations of half-metallic carbon nitride material, and meanwhile the fundamentals provide inspirations for the steering of electron transfer and solar energy absorption in electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and photovoltaic cells.

However, it is challenging for the conventional EK to achieve the desired outcome for the migration and degradation of PHE. Iron/activated carbon (Fe/C) particles were often used in the wastewater treatment. In the micro-electrolysis process, significant degradation of organic compounds was achieved by Fe/C galvanic cells; thus, Fe/C particles were also potential materials for permeable reaction barriers (PRBs). In this study, the surfactant-enhanced EK coupled with a Fe/C-PRB was used to treat PHE-contaminated soil. A nonionic surfactant, Tween 80, was selected as the solubility-enhancing agent. In addition, the Fe/C mixture was used as the PRB filling material. Seven sets of tests were conducted to investigate the performance of EK-PRB to remove PHE from contaminated soil. In addition, the impact of potential gradient and surfactants on the soil remediation was investigated. Furthermore, the methods including scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize iron in PRB and analyze the effect of EK on the micro-electrolysis in PRB. Results showed that PHE migrated toward the cathode under the driving force of electro-osmotic flow, and reacted with Fe/C-PRB. After 5 days of repair, the removal efficiency of PHE in the test group with the potential gradient of 1 V/cm and the Fe/C mass ratio of 4:1 was 3.5 times as high as that in the control group in which only EK was applied. Removal efficiency of PHE in the test group and control group were 14.4% and 4.11%, respectively. Addition of Tween 80 also improved desorption and mobility of PHE in the soil. It was noteworthy that when the potential gradient was increased from 1 to 2 V/cm, the removal efficiency of PHE was increased by 42.3% (26.9% vs. 18.9%).

The CNTs nanofiber foam/epoxy composite was prepared by a vacuum impregnation method. Due to the multiple reflections and interface effects produced by the special structure, the best microwave absorption effect is achieved with a lower CNTs content. When the CNTs content is 0.92 wt%, the lowest reflection loss is -42.13 dB (6.6 GHz, 2.9 mm). Under the premise of not adding magnetic loss materials, only CNTs are used as a reinforcing material, and a resin matrix composite with excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance without micropore defects is obtained. This method has universal applicability and broadens the further application of resin matrix composite in the aerospace and electronic fields.

The theoretical energy density is five times larger than that of a conventional lithium ion battery. Various challenges have hindered the use of this highly attractive cathode including the insulating nature of sulfur and poor electrode stability resulting in an irreversible capacity loss due to polysulfide migration from the cathode to the anode. Here we show a simple, scalable, room temperature bottom up approach for the synthesis of a nanostructured sulfur cathode which comprises a sulfur particle embedded with hollow carbon nanospheres encapsulated with polyelectrolyte multilayers. We demonstrate that specific capacity, rate capacity and cycling stability of the Li-S battery are significantly affected by the selection of polyelectrolyte multilayers.

At the discharge stage, the Ag/AC catalyst had the highest CO2 yield, chlorobenzene mineralization rate and carbon balance, and the lowest emission of chlorobenzene when compared with the other catalysts under the same conditions. However, the Ag/AC catalyst exhibited the worst reducing ozone generation performance, while the Mn/AC catalyst showed the best ozone decomposition ability. The organic intermediates produced using Ag/AC and Ce/AC were simpler and in lower concentrations than those formed using Mn/AC. The adsorption capacity and catalytic activity of the Ag/AC catalyst showed no obvious decrease after five cycles. Fourier transform infrared and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses after the reaction showed that some nitrogen organic intermediates and chlorine substances produced via the degradation of chlorobenzene were adsorbed onto the catalyst surface. CONCLUSIONS Ag/AC exhibited a longer breakthrough time, higher breakthrough capacity, higher CO2 yield, less chlorobenzene emission and better carbon balance when compared with the other catalysts.

In this work, a Fe-35Mn-0.5C alloy with low Mn volatility, high density, and favorable mechanical properties is fabricated by the metal injection molding (MIM) process. The effects of sintering pressure and minor carbon addition on microstructure and mechanical properties were studied. The corresponding mechanical deformation mechanism was discussed. The results show that a significant reduction in the proportion of Mn volatilization to less than 0.5% and higher relative density of 97 +/- 0.30% are achieved in the MIM-treated Fe-35Mn-0.5C alloy by pressurized sintering at 5 atm and 0.5 wt.% carbon addition. The optimized tensile properties are attained, with an ultimate tensile strength of 772 MPa, yield strength of 290 MPa, and elongation of 35% at room temperature, which meets the mechanical needs of metallic materials for biologically implantable medical devices.

The fourth-order Stokes and second-order anti-Stokes lines were generated when the pump laser energy was about 1.909 mJ in one sample cell (C-1) only. However, the same result was obtained in the second sample cell (C-2) with a pump energy of 0.883 mJ. At the same time, the fifth-order Stokes line was produced in C-2 when the pump energy increased to 1.208 mJ, and the coherent radiation wavelength ranged from 498 to 644 nm. The result was attributed to the resonance enhancement effect, where the frequency difference between the pump laser and the Stokes light emitted from the working medium (CS2) self-matched with the vibrational energy level of C = S, which resulted in the generation of the cascaded broadband SRS. The anti-Stokes SRS was attributed to four-wave mixing. Simultaneously, the pulse durations of the Stokes and anti-Stokes were compressed to about 380 ps by SRS and laser-induced breakdown. The resonance effect not only reduced the threshold, but it also generated broadband and short-pulse SRS.

To observe the clinical efficacy and safety of carbon dioxide laser combined with ALA photodynamics in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum. Method. A total of 211 patients with condyloma acuminatum admitted to our hospital from April 2018 to June 2021 were selected as the observation object. They were divided into the intervention group (CO2 laser combined with ALA photodynamic therapy, 125 cases) and conventional group (CO2 laser treatment, 86 cases), and the efficacy and incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups were compared. Result. The total effective rate of the intervention group (96.00%) was significantly higher than that of the conventional group (84.88%) (P < 0.05). The total incidence of adverse reactions in the intervention group (8.00%) was lower than that in the conventional group (32.56%) (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that the patient's smoking history, drinking history, course of disease, wart area, and number of sexual partners were related to the short-term prognosis (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the patient's course of disease, the area of the wart body, and the number of sexual partners were independent factors affecting the prognosis of patients with condyloma acuminatum (P < 0.05). Conclusion. Carbon dioxide laser combined with ALA dynamics treatment of condyloma acuminatum significantly improves the clinical efficacy, does not increase the incidence of adverse reactions, and has important clinical therapeutic value. The course of the disease, the area of the wart, and the number of sexual partners are independent factors affecting the prognosis of patients with condyloma acuminatum.

The results indicated that acylated gelatine could effectively constrain the resolution of polysulphide into the electrolyte because of carbonyl groups' strong affinity for polysulphide. Meanwhile it also served as a strong dispersion and adhesion agent for the cathode materials. Cyclic voltammograms and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments showed that the prepared cathodes have less polarization and lower transfer resistance compared to gelatine binder-sulphur cathode. The prepared cathode exhibited a much higher initial and reversible capacity after 100 cycles at rates of 0.1 and 0.5 degrees C than that of gelatine bindersulphur cathode under the same condition. Our findings have shown that acylated gelatine is a promising binder to improve Li-S performance and helpful for its future development.

An evaluation of the impact of multiwalled carbon nanotubes on soil microbial community structure and functioning	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS			English	Article						Nanomaterials; MWNTs; Soil microbial community; Risk assessment; Pyrosequencing	HYDROCARBON-DEGRADING BACTERIA; HEAVY-METAL CONTAMINATION; FATTY-ACIDS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; SCOTT BASE; NANOMATERIALS; BIOMASS; NANOPARTICLES; DIVERSITY; DEGRADATION	This study evaluated the impacts of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) on microbial community composition and functioning in a sandy loam soil over 90 d. We used test concentrations in the range of lower MWNT concentrations (10 mg/kg) to extremely high MWNT concentrations (10,000 mg/kg) as a worst case scenario. We observed no effects of MWNTs on soil respiration, enzymatic activities, and microbial community composition at 10, 100 and 1000 mg/kg. However, increases in fungal fatty acid methyl ester markers were observed at the highest treatment. In addition, pyroseguencing demonstrated a decreased abundance of some bacterial genera like Derxia, Holophaga, Opitutus and Waddlia at the highest treatment while bacterial genera that are considered potential degraders of recalcitrant contaminants (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) like Rhodococcus, Cellulomonas, Nocardioides and Pseudomonas increased. These results suggest a shift in soil microbial community composition to more tolerant microbial populations in the presence of extremely high MWNT concentrations. It is unlikely that the change observed at 10,000 mg/kg is due to metal or carbon impurities as the MWNTs used in this study were of high purity. Given the need for wide-ranging data for regulation and risk assessment of nanomaterials, this study provides valuable data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the cytotoxic properties of this novel carbon nanomaterial are rarely investigated, and the mechanisms behind their cytotoxicity are totally unknown. In this study, the antibacterial activity of graphdiyne (GDY) and graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) is reported. GDY is capable of inhibiting broad-spectrum bacterial growth while exerting moderate cytotoxicity on mammalian cells. In comparison, GDYO exhibits lower antibacterial activity than that of GDY. Then an alterable, synergetic antibacterial mechanism of GDY, involving wrapping bacterial membrane, membrane insertion and disruption, and reactive oxygen species generation is demonstrated, while the differential gene expression analysis indicates that GDY could only alter the bacterial metabolism slightly and the oxidative stress route may be a minor bactericidal factor. The investigation of the antibacterial behaviors of GDY based nanomaterials may provide useful guidelines for the future design and application of this novel molecular allotrope of carbon.

Our DFT calculations demonstrate that group 3 metal silylamides are able to accomplish the CO2 reduction reaction, where the scandium one bears the best catalytic activity. It requires very small positive free energy to capture CO2. The subsequent hydrogenation reactions are thermodynamically and kinetically favored, where the transition state (*CO2H2)(#) costs 4.7 kcal/mol energy. Comparatively, the water elimination requires to absorb less energy.

This is however a very challenging task. Herein, we describe a new method to nail down low-oxidation-state NbOx nanoparticles at high temperature without overgrowth using the surface pores on carbon and then deposit Pt head selectively on top of NbOx derived by the redox reduction between themselves. This new structured catalyst, Pt-NbOxC, exhibited mass activities higher than 0.5 A mg(-1) after 50,000 cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V and 5,000 cycles between 1 and 1.5 V, which are 7 and 4 times of the 0.07 and 0.13 A mg(-1), respectively, on Pt/C. That high sustainable ORR activity is ascribed to strong metal-support interaction that maximizes Pt utilization and minimizes particle agglomeration, carbon corrosion and metal oxidation. Furthermore, the method embedded nanoparticles into carbon pores will likely be used in developing small particles with uniform dispersion for various applications.

Herein, we report the use of the zirconium MOFs (UiO-66) as a precursor to prepare N-doped carbon nanoparticles (NC) with high specific surface area (1609.1 m(2)/g) by direct carbonization and etching processes. Then, polyaniline (PANI) was growth on the NC by in-situ polymerization, showing a superb efficiency and stability for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) removal. Due to the synergistic effect of adsorption and reduction of the obtained PANI@NC nanocomposites, the maximum adsorption capacity was 198.04 mg/g. The effects of different adsorbents, pH, adsorbent dosage, co-existing ions, concentration of Cr(VI) were studied on the Cr(VI) adsorption. The kinetics of adsorption of Cr(VI) followed the Pseudo-second-order model and the adsorption isotherm data fitted well to the Langmuir isothermal model. Importantly, excellent stability of PANI@NC nanocomposites was demonstrated after five cycles. The results of this research indicate that PANI@NC nanocomposites were the promising adsorbent for removal of Cr(VI) from waste water.

Electrochemical testing results show that Ketjen Black makes the P composites present much better cycling performances. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) results indicate that when Ketjen Black is used, the total resistance of the electrode can be decreased. Since Ketjen Black is a low-cost and commercially available material, our results suggest that Ketjen Black might be a promising conductor for the alloying anodes such as P in sodium-ion batteries.

Finally, 3DOM carbon materials were removed through sintering process and 3DOM ZrO2 materials were obtained. The microstructures of obtained samples were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The final macroporous ZrO2 could successfully replicate the 3DOM structure of carbon and had less than 5% shrinkage. The result indicates that 3DOM carbon could be efficiently used as two-step templated materials and obtained 3DOM ZrO2 had a very small shrinkage.

Composite sulfur cathodes, comprising initially elemental sulfur and carbon, undergo pronounced structural and morphological changes during discharge-charge cycles due to the complicated redox behavior of sulfur in nonaqueous electrolyte solutions that contain Li ions. Nevertheless, Li-S cells can demonstrate prolonged cycling. To advance this technology, it is highly important to understand the evolution of the structure and morphology of sulfur cathodes as cycling proceeds. High resolution scanning and tunneling microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy were used in conjunction with the electrochemical measurements. A special methodology for slicing composite sulfur electrodes and their cross sectioning and depth profiling was developed. The gradual changes in the structure of sulfur cathodes due to cycling is described and discussed herein. Important phenomena include changes in the surface electrical conductivity of sulfur electrodes and pronounced morphological changes due to the irreversibility of the sulfur redox reactions. Based on the observations presented in this work, it may be possible to outline guidelines for improving Li-S battery technology and extending its cycle life. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.

Nonetheless, infinite volume change and severe dendrite growth impede its practicability. To date, unremitting efforts have been devoted to stabilizing Li metal anode via the rational design of 3D current collectors. In this sense, optimizing Li nucleation behavior plays a pivotal role in alleviating the dendrite formation. Herein, a practically viable route is devised by in situ crafting lithiophilic CuSe granules on the dealloyed Cu skeleton (D-Cu@CuSe). Persuasive electrochemical analysis and systematic theoretical calculation disclose the underlying Li nucleation mechanism on the CuSe overlayer. Impressively, the D-Cu@CuSe-Li symmetric cell can sustain a stable plating/stripping operation over 1000 h at a high depth of discharge at 62.5%. More crucially, when paired with high-loading sulfur cathodes, D-Cu@CuSe-Li||S batteries harvest advanced areal capacity and stable cycling performance even under stringent working conditions of low negative-to-positive (N/P) (approximate to 2) and electrolyte-to-sulfur (8 mu L mg(s)(-1)) ratios. Overall, a fresh perspective into rationalizing current collector design is afforded, which extends Li utilization and cycling durability in the pursuit of pragmatic Li metal anodes.

J	Li, S; Sheng, MY; Yuan, FY; Yin, J				Li, Shuang; Sheng, Maoyin; Yuan, Faying; Yin, Jie			Effect of land cover change on total SOC and soil PhytOC accumulation in the karst subtropical forest ecosystem, SW China	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Land cover change; Karst; Phytolith; Soil organic carbon; Reserves	CARBON BIO-SEQUESTRATION; OCCLUDED-CARBON; STOICHIOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS; ROCKY DESERTIFICATION; PHYTOLITHS; WETLAND; LITTER; PLANT	Purpose Soil organic carbon (SOC), especially the stable SOC, have the important ecological function in the carbon cycle. As a typical stable SOC, soil phytolith-occluded organic carbon (PhytOC) is one of the important mechanisms of long-term soil carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the distribution characteristics, accumulation law, and cycle process of soil PhytOC in fragile karst ecosystems are still not cognized. The purpose of the present study is to obtain the distribution pattern and change law of total SOC and soil PhytOC in different land cover types and to clarify the influencing factors and driving mechanism of land cover change on total SOC and soil PhytOC content and storage in the karst ecosystem. Materials and methods In the typical karst area of Southwest China, five representative land cover types, including bamboo forest (BF), coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (CBF), shrub (SH), grassland (GL), and agricultural abandoned land (AAL), were selected as the research objects. The total SOC contents, soil PhytOC contents, and soil physical and chemical properties were determined in the lab. Soil PhytOC and total SOC storage were calculated by the formulas. Data were analyzed statistically by linear regression, Pearson correlation analysis, LSD multiple comparison, and principal component analysis. Results and discussion Land cover change can affect obviously total SOC and soil PhytOC content and storage in the karst subtropical forest. Among the five land cover types, soil phytolith content, soil PhytOC content and storage, and total SOC storage of each soil profile in the BF were all significantly higher than those of the other four land covers. Among the three different soil profiles of 0 similar to 10, 10 similar to 20, and 20 similar to 30 cm, total SOC and soil PhytOC contents of the surface soil layer in the five land cover types were all the most, and the content decreased obviously with the increase of soil depth. There were significant positive correlation between the contents of soil available silicon, phytolith, and PhytOC. Soil available silicon content, soil phytolith content, and soil C/N were significantly positive related with the accumulation of total SOC and soil PhytOC. Soil PhytOC content or storage was significant or extremely significant related with total SOC content or storage. Conclusions The results of the present study provided scientific bases for further evaluating the carbon sink capacity of soil PhytOC in the karst ecosystem, in SW China, and have important values in the reduction of carbon emission and increase of carbon sink to combat the global warming. In addition, the results of the present study also can provide theoretical references for the vegetation restoration of karst rocky desertification in Southwest China.

This study aims to fabricate a flexible, high-sensitivity and breathable humidity sensor for skin humidity monitoring. The sensor includes two parts, i.e., shape memory polylactic acid fiber (SMPLAF) as the substrate and crumpled graphene oxide (CGO) membrane as the top humidity-sensitive layer. SMPLAF was firstly stretched and then heated to restore its original shape to obtain the CGO membrane. The unique crumpled morphology of CGO membrane provides a large specific surface area and high capillary force, which facilitates the rapid exchange of water molecules between the sensing CGO membrane and the external environment. Accordingly, the sensor exhibits excellent humidity sensitivity, fast response time (< 5 s) and long term stability (15 days). Moreover, the CGO-based sensor demonstrates excellent flexibility. Bent at 120, the response almost unchanged, whereas the response of the sensor without CGO decreased from 0.89 to 0.66. Though the sensor has the disadvantage of unstable performance at high RH, it could be overcome by controlling the wavelength of the crumpled structure of CGO. Due to the above superior properties, the sensor shows promising potentials for human breath monitoring and skin humidity test.

Coupled Deformation and Diffusion Process at the Stainless Steel/Carbon Steel Interface in the Deformation Bonding Process	STRENGTH OF MATERIALS			English	Article						composites; interface; deformation bonding; diffusion; mechanical surface treatment	ROLL; EXTRUSION; EVOLUTION; FRICTION; BEHAVIOR; TEXTURE; LAYER	Cylindrical and surface-treated blanks were used to prepare stainless steel/carbon steel composite specimens at different temperatures. The coupled deformation and diffusion of materials at the interface were investigated by SEM and ultrasonic C scanning detection. The difference in the elongation of the two metals is shown to result in tearing at the interface in the deformation bonding process. Cracks are mainly located in a more readily expanding substrate and are more pronounced at lower deformation temperatures. With an increase in deformation temperatures, the bonding efficiency also increases significantly, but the diffusion layer thickness is basically the same. The bonding efficiency of composites can be greatly improved by mechanical surface treatment at normal deformation temperatures.	[Li, S.; Zhang, Q. D.; Liu, J.

RDX/AP-CMDB Propellants Containing Fullerenes and Carbon Black Additives	DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Fullerene; combustion properties; burning rate; CMDB propellant; RDX/AP-CMDB propellants	DOUBLE-BASE PROPELLANT; COMBUSTION	The influence of fullerene additives on the combustion behaviour of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine/ammonium perchlorate composite modified double-base (RDX/AP-CMDB) propellants are investigated by thermogravimetric-differential thermogravimetric (TG-DTG) analysis, burning rate tests, and scanning electron microscopy observations. The difference between lead salicylate (Phi-Pb) and bismuth citrate acid (C Pi-Bi) as combustion modifiers has also been examined. TG-DTG investigations show that the addition of all additives advanced and accelerated the evaporation of nitroglycerin (NG). The addition of Extracted Fullerene Soot (EFS), C(60) and carbon black (CB) additives obviously accelerated the liquid phase decomposition of NG. Also, the solid phase decomposition of nitrocellulose (NC) and the liquid phase decomposition of RDX were accelerated by 0.5 per cent Fullerene Soot (FS)/2.5 per cent C Pi-Bi/0.5 per cent copper adipic acid (J-Cu) composite catalyst. The addition of all composite catalysts promoted the decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) except 0.5 per cent EFS/2.5 per cent C Pi-Bi/0.5 per cent J-Cu composite catalysts. It is well known that there exists dark zone in the flame structure of RDX-CMDB propellant, but in our observation, the dark zone vanished with the addition of 10 per cent AP to the forenamed propellant. The burning rates were increased at low pressure but reduced at high pressure by all catalysts except 0.5 per cent EFS/2.5 per cent C Pi-Bi/0.5 per cent J-Cu and 0.5 per cent C(60)/2.5 per cent C Pi-Bi/0.5 per cent J-Cu which reduced the burning rates at every tested pressure. The pressure exponents of tested propellants were reduced by 0.5 per cent EFS/2.5 per cent C Pi-Bi/0.5 per cent J-Cu with a factor of 17 per cent. The quenched surface observations significantly differed with the additions of diverse composite catalysts, which were consistent with the burning rate results.	[Han, X.; Wang, T. F.; Lin, Z.

Here, a simple method is proposed to prepare Fe2P nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Fe2P@NPCNTs) through a self-growth strategy. In addition, it is worth noting that Fe2P@NPCNTs have high catalytic activity and good stability as ORR catalysts due to the unique structure of the material, the synergy between the components, and the large specific surface area. As expected, the catalyst has a half-wave potential (0.827 V) close to commercial Pt/C and a lower Tafel slope (54.17 mV dec(-1)) compared to other samples. Meanwhile, the zinc-air battery with Fe2P@NPCNTs as catalysts exhibits high open-circuit voltage, good maximum power density, and excellent stability. Therefore, this cheap and simple method is generally available for the synthesis of other non-noble metal catalysts for various energy systems.

The introduction of metal particles on a CNT fiber can effectively improve its electrical conductivity. However, the decrease in strength is observed in CNT-metal composite fibers. Here we demonstrate a continuous process, which combines fiber spinning, CNT anodization and metal deposition, to fabricate lightweight and high-strength CNT-Cu fibers with metal-like conductivities. The composite fiber with anodized CNTs exhibits a conductivity of 4.08 x 10(4)-1.84 x 10(5) S cm(-1) and a mass density of 1.87-3.08 g cm(-3), as the Cu thickness is changed from 1 to 3 mu m. It can be 600-811 MPa in strength, as strong as the un-anodized pure CNT fiber (656 MPa). We also find that during the tensile tests there are slips between the inner CNTs and the outer Cu layer, leading to the drops in electrical conductivity. Therefore, there is an effective fiber strength before which the Cu layer is robust. Due to the improved interfacial bonding between the Cu layer and the anodized CNT surfaces, such effective strength is still high, up to 490-570 MPa.

RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							SUPERHALOGEN ANIONS X; AB-INITIO; IONIZATION-POTENTIALS; ALPHA CALCULATIONS; CORRELATION-ENERGY; EXCESS-ELECTRON; HALIDE CLUSTERS; PTF6-SALTS; STABILITY; BR	LiF2 and Li2F are typical examples of molecular species showing superhalogen and superalkali behavior, respectively. HF, DFT (B3LYP, B3PW91), MP2, CCSD and CCSD(T) calculations are performed to study the interaction between LiF2 and Li2F which forms a ring shaped Li3F3 superatomic cluster. It is well known that Li3F3 can be formed by trimerization of LiF. However, these two isostructures can be distinguished by considering the effect of extra electrons on Li3F3. Our MP2 calculations have shown that extra electrons are delocalized on Li's of the Li2F moiety in the case of LiF2-Li2F but delocalized over all Li's in the case of (LiF)(3). Finally, we have discussed the formation of one dimensional assemblies of Li3F3 superatomic rings which may mimic the bulk behavior and can be realized by inserting Li3F3 rings in one dimensional nano templates such as carbon nanotubes.

In our work SNC were prepared by acidolysis. The starch nanocrystal-carbon black-natural rubber (SNC/CB/NR) composites were obtained by blending CB/NR master batch with SNC/NR master batch in the open mill. The effectof SNC on the properties of CB/NR composites was investigated. The results showed that mechanical properties decreased with the increasing content of the SNC. The abrasion surface was observed by scanning electron microscopy and the abrasion surface of samples were much rougher. Thermal analysis presented that the glass transition temperature and the endothermal peak decreased gradually with the increment of SNC and the thermal degradation reaction of SNC/CB/NR composites was two-step reaction. The curves of G' and tan d versus strain of vulcanization were presented by rubber process analyzer, respectively. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis showed that the loss factor at 0 degrees C, SNC increased and decreased at 60-80 degrees C by adding SNC.	[Gao, Y. J. S.; Fang, L.; Li, L. F.; Liao, S.

Though traditional electrochemical techniques have probed these issues intensively, it is amazing to find that the negative resistance presents in the intermediate potential zone during an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. Based on the chemical reaction analysis, we establish an EIS model and make some numerical analyses, thus determining the specific EIS shapes and equivalent circuits relating to various potential zones. These results not only compensate the drawback for traditional electrochemical approaches, but also reveal the dynamic adsorption of CO and OH species on Pt surfaces, providing a chance for understanding bifunctional mechanism towards quantitative manners. Significantly, we clarify that the negative resistance begins from the maximum catalysis of methanol electrocatalysis and ends in the initial passive state on Pt surfaces, offering a tool for further improvement. Interestingly, our discovery for negative resistance is consistent with that in general electrochemical system, facilitating its extension and direction in future.

J	Rafie, A; Pai, R; Kalra, V				Rafie, Ayda; Pai, Rahul; Kalra, Vibha			A dual-role electrolyte additive for simultaneous polysulfide shuttle inhibition and redox mediation in sulfur batteries	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							LI2S CATHODES; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; THIOUREA; ELECTROOXIDATION; OXIDATION; GOLD; LIFE; CELL	In Li-S batteries, the insulating nature of sulfur and Li2S causes enormous challenges, such as high polarization and low active material utilization. The nucleation of the solid discharge product, Li2S, during the discharge cycle, and the activation of Li2S in the subsequent charge cycle, cause a potential challenge that needs to be overcome. Moreover, the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfide intermediate species results in active material loss and early capacity fade. In this study, we have used thiourea as an electrolyte additive and showed that it serves as both a redox mediator to overcome the Li2S activation energy barrier and a shuttle inhibitor to mitigate the notorious polysulfide shuttling via the investigation of thiourea redox activity, shuttle current measurements and study of Li2S activation. The steady-state shuttle current of the Li-S battery shows a 6-fold drop when 0.02 M thiourea is added to the standard electrolyte. Moreover, by adding thiourea, the charge plateau for the first cycle of the Li2S based cathodes shifts from 3.5 V (standard ether electrolyte) to 2.5 V (with 0.2 M thiourea). Using this additive, the capacity of the Li-S battery stabilizes at similar to 839 mA h g(-1) after 5 cycles and remains stable over 700 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.025% per cycle, a tremendous improvement compared to the reference battery that retains only similar to 350 mA h g(-1) after 300 cycles. In the end, to demonstrate the practical and broad applicability of thiourea in overcoming sulfur-battery challenges and in eliminating the need for complex electrode design, we study two additional battery systems - lithium metal-free cells with a graphite anode and Li2S cathode, and Li-S cells with simple slurry-based cathodes fabricated via blending commercial carbon black/S and a binder. We believe that this study manifests the advantages of redox active electrolyte additives to overcome several bottlenecks in the Li-S battery field.

This voltammetric sensor exhibited strong catalytic effect toward the oxidation of 8- hydroxyquinoline(8-HQ) in HAc-NaAc buffer solution (0.2M, pH 3.6). A new analytical method for determining 8-HQ was established. Under the optimized condition, the anodic peak current was linear with the concentration of 8-HQ in the range of 2x10(-8)similar to 1.0x10(-5)M with a detection limit of 9x10(-9) M.

However, the potential influencing mechanisms of metal ions on the adsorption of organic pollutants at a molecular level were rarely studied. Here, we investigated the effects of Cu(II) on the adsorption of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by carboxylic and amino CNTs/CoFe2O4 composites, and the mechanisms were revealed by spectroscopy analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results showed distinct effects of Cu(II) on SMX and E2 adsorption by CNTs/CoFe2O4. For E2, a nonionic chemical, Cu(II) slightly inhibited E2 adsorption by CNTs/CoFe2O4 due to the increased aggregation of the composites induced by Cu(II). For SMX, an ionic chemical, Cu(II) enhanced SMX adsorption significantly mainly due to Cu(II) bridging and stronger pi-pi pi interactions between SMX and Cu(II) complexes and CNTs. The complexation of SMX with Cu(II) was confirmed by the fluorescence, ultraviolet (UV), and attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis. DFT calculation further revealed that isoxazole ring nitrogen, sulfonamide nitrogen, amino nitrogen, and sulfonyl oxygen were the four possible binding sites in SMX with Cu(II). The adsorbed Cu (II) on CNTs/CoFe2O4 could form complexes with SMX, and the binding between SMX and Cu(II) enhanced the pi-pi interactions between SMX and CNTs. These two aspects led to the enhanced adsorption of SMX. This study provides new insights into the molecular interactions among Cu(II), SMX, and CNTs, and it sheds lights on the adsorption mechanisms of organic pollutants by CNTs in the presence of metal ions.

J	Li, W; Li, S				Li, Wei; Li, Song			CO2 adsorption performance of functionalized metal-organic frameworks of varying topologies by molecular simulations	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Carbon capture; Adsorption; Topology; Pore size; Functionalization	CARBON-DIOXIDE SEPARATION; POROUS MATERIALS; GAS-ADSORPTION; PORE-SIZE; CAPTURE; STORAGE; CHEMISTRY; DESIGN	The mixed linker metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) consisting of a variety of organic linkers functionalized by multiple functional groups exhibit better performance in carbon capture due to the increased surface heterogeneity. In order to explore the influence of the framework topology and mixed functionalities on the carbon capture performance, in this work, Zr-MOFs in three topologies (csq, ftw, scu) with each composed by one of the three types of linkers of different lengths were constructed, which were then functionalized by three types of functional groups (-F, -NH2, -OCH3), respectively. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were used to investigate CO2 adsorption performance of all created MOFs. We revealed that among the parent MOFs consisted of identical building blocks but in different topologies, ftw-MOFs exhibit the highest CO2 working capacity and CO2/N-2 selectivity due to the strong affinity towards CO2. Moreover, the CO2 adsorption performance of ftw-MOFs shows obvious dependence on the pore size, consistent with their host-adsorbate interaction energy, which is not the fact for csqMOFs and scu-MOFs. The enhanced CO2 adsorption performance upon functionalization of MOFs displays pore-size dependence as well, especially for -NH2 functionalized frameworks in csq and scu, which is mostly attributed to the enhanced host-adsorbate Coulombic interaction. The proposed effects of the topology, the pore size and the functional group on CO2 adsorption performance of MOFs obtained in this study may provide meaningful insight into the rational design of high-performing MOFs for carbon capture by tuning the topology, pore size and functionality of frameworks.

Herein, SnS nanoparticles were grown in situ on Snatom-modified N,S-codoped mesoporous carbon nanosheets. As a result, a novel nanohybrid (NH) catalyst named SnS/Sn-NSC NH was obtained for CO2 electroreduction for formate production. In the obtained NHs, the synergistic effect of SnS nanoparticles (similar to 2.2 nm) with Sn atoms in the carbon matrix and the 3D hierarchical porous structure could provide more active sites and shorten the diffusion pathway, thereby improving the performance of CO2 reduction. The SnS/Sn-NSC NH showed a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate of 91% at a low potential of -0.7 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In particular, the SnS/Sn-NSC NH demonstrated a favorable FE(formate )value of over 80% over a wide potential range. On the basis of spectroscopic characterizations, electrochemical tests, and CO2 adsorption analyses, the origin of the enhanced catalytic performance was suggested. This work offers an efficient strategy to construct 3D hierarchical SnS/Sn-NSC NHs for enhancing formate productivity through CO(2 )electrocatalytic reduction.

However, the fabrication of Fenton-like catalysts with adequate activity and stability towards toxic benzene derivates is still a long-term goal. Herein, we report a novel Fenton-like 2D porous carbon catalyst with co-anchored Co-N-x sites and nanocrystalline Co by annealing core-shell bimetallic metal-organic framework (MOF)-coated graphene oxide. During carbonization, the N-ligands in the MOF provide self-pyrolyzed reducing gases, while the Co2+ salts and gradually formed nanocrystalline Co serve as the in situ catalysts for the growth of Co/Co-N-x co-doped carbon nanotubes, which avoids the use of the chemical vapor deposition process. Benefiting from the unique core-shell MOF nanostructures, the fabricated 2D hierarchical catalysts display delicate micro/mesoporous structures, conductive carbon frameworks, and abundant Co/Co-N-x/pyridinic-N active sites. These unique advantages endow the catalysts with high degradation efficiencies towards different toxic benzene-derived compounds, such as bisphenol A, phenol, biphenyl, naphthalene, and even benzene-derived macromolecules. This research not only provides Fenton-like catalysts with excellent potential for the water remediation of benzene-derived contaminants, but also takes a step toward the production of advanced metal/metal-N co-doped 2D porous carbon for diverse catalytic and energy applications.

Stabilizing lithium-sulphur cathodes using polysulphide reservoirs	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; MESOPOROUS SILICA; ELECTRODE; BATTERY	The possibility of achieving high-energy, long-life storage batteries has tremendous scientific and technological significance. An example is the Li-S cell, which can offer a 3-5-fold increase in energy density compared with conventional Li-ion cells, at lower cost. Despite significant advances, there are challenges to its wide-scale implementation, which include dissolution of intermediate polysulphide reaction species into the electrolyte. Here we report a new concept to mitigate the problem, which relies on the design principles of drug delivery. Our strategy employs absorption of the intermediate polysulphides by a porous silica embedded within the carbon-sulphur composite that not only absorbs the polysulphides by means of weak binding, but also permits reversible desorption and release. It functions as an internal polysulphide reservoir during the reversible electrochemical process to give rise to long-term stabilization and improved coulombic efficiency. The reservoir mechanism is general and applicable to Li/S cathodes of any nature.

Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetics of the electrocatalysis process and the high cost of anode catalysts still impede the wide application of DAFC. Moreover, the limited understanding of the reaction mechanism restrains the development of anode catalysts. Here, we have prepared a Pd-(SnO(2)pC)/C catalyst and highlighted a strategy to demonstrate the effects of active oxygen-contained species and electronic interaction, which are identified to have a synergistic effect. The as-prepared Pd-(SnO2@C)/C catalyst showed remarkable activity and stability for EOR and MOR in alkaline media. It also had an encouraging performance in a polymer fiber membrane-based alkaline DAFC, where a NiCo2O4 catalyst was used for the oxygen cathode. Combined with the theoretical analysis and the experimental research results, this study reveals that the electronic interaction is the dominant mechanism in the synergistic effect, which provides theoretical guidance and technical support for the preparation of the next generation of high catalytic activity and high stability anode catalysts of DAFC.

The catalysts were prepared by deposition-precipitation and characterized by XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, TEM and FT-IR. Due to the modification of the surface functional groups, surface structure and surface acidities of active carbon via pretreatment, the Pd/C catalysts showed varied catalytic performances. High dispersion and uniform particles were conducive to the excellent activity of Pd/C catalyst with support copretreated with HNO3 and NaClO, which exhibited 89.5% selectivity towards methyl-gamma-butyrolactone at 180 degrees C, 4 MPa H-2 for 20 h.

The obtained freeze-dried 3D gels have a well-defined and interconnected 3D porous network, which allows the adsorbate molecules to diffuse easily into the adsorbent. AFM images confirmed that the biopolymers had been successfully adsorbed onto the GO nanosheets through noncovalent interactions with apparently increased thicknesses. In this proposed biologically 3D noncovalent assembly, the use of biopolymers, such as proteins, DNA, and chitosan, plays an essential role in the advancement of biologically compatible adsorbents and the realization of novel, multifunctional and heterogeneous integration of materials. Meanwhile, the blood compatibility of the GO/biopolymer gels was investigated by using human red blood cells (RBCs), which indicated that the as-prepared GO/biopolymer gels exhibited ultralow hemolysis ratio (lower than 1%) and better RBCs compatibility than the pristine GO sponge, since the adsorbed biopolymers could effectively mediate the surfactant-like property of the GO sheet. Furthermore, the 3D GO/biopolymer gels revealed ultra-high adsorption capacities against toxic cationic molecules and heavy metal ions, and presented great potential in blood purification fields. Moreover, the obtained gels also presented multifunctional ability, e.g. drug molecule delivery, and had high drug loading capacity and controllable releasing speed. The excellent blood compatibility and high toxic molecules loading capacity of the GO/biopolymer gels might confer it great potentials for various blood-contact applications.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study of the Capacitive Performance of a Binary Mixture of Ionic Liquids near an Onion-like Carbon Electrode	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							ELECTRICAL DOUBLE-LAYER; DIFFERENTIAL CAPACITANCE; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; ENERGY DENSITY; TEMPERATURE; INTERFACE; SUPERCAPACITORS; GRAPHENE	An equimolar mixture of 1-methyl-1-propylpyrrolidinium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C(3)mpy][Tf2N]), 1-methyl-1-butylpiperidinium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([C(4)mpip][Tf2N]) was investigated by classic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements verified that the binary mixture exhibited lower glass transition temperature than either of the pure room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). Moreover, the binary mixture gave rise to higher conductivity than the neat RTILs at lower temperature range. In order to study its capacitive performance in supercapacitors, simulations were performed of the mixture, and the neat RTILs used as electrolytes near an onion-like carbon (OLC) electrode at varying temperatures. The differential capacitance exhibited independence of the electrical potential applied for three electrolytes, which is in agreement with previous work on OLC electrodes in a different RTILs. Positive temperature dependence of the differential capacitance was observed, and it was dominated by the electrical double layer (EDL) thickness, which is for the first time substantiated in MD simulation.

While recent studies have assessed the effects of O-3 on terrestrial carbon fluxes, the potential impacts on atmospheric CO2 concentrations have not been quantified. Here, we use a regional climate model (RegCM-CHEM4) coupled with the Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere model YD3s to estimate the effects of O-3 exposure on atmospheric CO2 over China. Compared to simulations without O-3 effects, sensitivity experiments with O-3 damage show a significant reduction (12.1 +/- 4.4%) in the gross primary productivity (GPP), up to 35% in summer. Meanwhile, terrestrial carbon sink is suppressed by 112.2 +/- 22.5 Tg C for 2013 at the national level. Strong inhibitions of O-3 on carbon fluxes are found in North, Northeast and South Central China, where O-3 levels are high. Consequently, we find a significant increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to O-3 -induced terrestrial carbon sink reduction. The increases of CO2 are more evident in the growing season. The maximum CO2 enhancement reaches as high as 6 ppm in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. Our assessments indicate that tropospheric O-3 has a detrimental impact on plant carbon uptake and leads to more CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere. Such impacts of O-3 should be taken into account in global carbon cycle and future climate change.

The compact self-assembled monolayer is obtained when the self-assembling temperature is 303 K, the self-assembling time is 4 h and the concentration of APMDES is 3%. To detect albumin by means of the nanogold-promoted precipitation of silver with the optimal signal-to-noise ratio, the parameters to influence the detection current signals and the background current signals are investigated using anodic stripping voltammetry. The obtained optimal processing conditions are as follows: the gold labeling temperature is 298 K and the time is 30 min, the silver enhancement temperature is 303 K and the time is 8 min. Under the above conditions, different concentrations of BSA are detected by anodic stripping voltammetry. The results showed that the peak currents are linear to the concentration of albumin over the wide range from 0.5 to 0.05 ng/mL, and the detection limit is 0.02 ng/mL, the regress linear equation is I (mu A) = 0.8254 + 1.4319 x C (ng/mL), R = 0.958, and the background current signals are smaller than 2.0 x 10(-7) A.

J	Zhu, TJ; Hao, XQ; Wu, Q; Wang, WJ				Zhu, Tianjiao; Hao, Xiaoqian; Wu, Qiao; Wang, Wenju			Exploring anchoring performance of defective MgO nanotubes for lithium-sulphur batteries: A density functional theory (DFT) study	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						adsorption; defective MgONT; density functional theory; Li-S batteries; lithium polysulphides	ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; MODIFIED SEPARATOR; ADSORPTION; POLYSULFIDES; IMPROVEMENT; GRAPHENE; CATHODES; HYDROGEN; NITROGEN; ENERGY	In recent years, lithium-sulphur batteries have received great attention due to their high theoretical specific capacity. In the exploration of improving battery performance, developing suitable anchoring materials is one of the ways to suppress the shuttle effect which is one of the main problems of lithium-sulphur batteries. In this work, we investigated the anchoring ability of MgO nanotubes (MgONT) and defective MgO nanotubes (MgONTv) to lithium polysulphides (LiPSs) by density functional theory (DFT). The defect formation energy, the HOMO and LUMO of the defective MgONT, the energy difference (Delta E), and the adsorption energy were calculated. The optimized structures of LiPSs adsorbed on the MgONT and MgONTv were also obtained. The calculation results show that MgONTv1 has a strong adsorption effect on LiPSs, and its adsorption energy ranges from -1.78 to -4.51 eV. The adsorption of LiPSs narrows the bandgap of MgONTv. In other words, the conductivity of MgONTv is better than the pristine one. Our study demonstrates that MgONTv has more robust adsorption performance for LiPSs, which is an effective addictive material for the cathode of lithium-sulphur batteries. It can provide a theoretical basis for exploring the application of new one-dimensional anchoring materials in the cathode of lithium-sulphur batteries.

In this study, the gadolinium-doped green luminescent carbon dots (Gd-CDs) were prepared by the simple one-step microwave-assisted polyol method. The obtained Gd-CDs emitted a unique green photoluminescence with a quantum yield of 5.4%. The Gd-CDs exhibited a low cytotoxicity and could optically label the C6 glioma cells. Meanwhile, the r(1) relaxivity of Gd-CDs was measured to be 11.356 mM(-1) s(-1). This high r(1) value together with the r(2)/r(1) ratio close to 1 nominates Gd-CDs as an excellent T-1 contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. These Gd-CDs combining two complementary imaging modalities are therefore a promising bimodal nanoprobe in medical imaging for a better diagnosis.

In diethyl ether Li-1 and LiCH2CN form a mixed dimeric (1:1) complex, while Li-2 and LiCH2CN form a mixed trimeric (2:1) complex. The dimer undergoes fast exchange between ketenimine and bridged structures. Both (1)J(N-15,Li-6) and (1)J(C-13, Li-6) couplings were observed for the respectively isotopically labeled compounds, In the trimeric complex the CH2CN anion also undergoes fast degenerate exchange between ketenimine and bridged structures, and the complex appears C-2-symmetric on the NMR spectroscopy time scale. Both the dimer and trimer complexes have the bridged acetonitrile anion in common, as indicated by the highly shielded alpha-carbon C-13 NMR shifts (delta -6.1 and -7.4, respectively). In tetrahydrofuran only N-metalated mixed LiCH2CN dimers were observed for both Li-1 and Li-2 with the less shielded C-13 NMR shifts of delta -2.5 and -2.2 for the alpha-carbon of LiCH2CN of the complexes.

Noncovalent functionalization is an attractive option for changing the interfacial properties of nanotubes because it does not destroy the nanotube grapheme structure. In this study, a new reactive copolymer, epoxy-toluene diisocyanate-Triton X-100 (EP-TDI-TX100) was successfully synthesized, which is shown to be highly effective in dispersing vapor-grown carbon nanofibers (VGCNFs) into individual or small bundles, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-vis absorption spectra. The strong pi-pi interaction between VGCNFs and EP-TDI-TX100 was revealed by Raman spectra and the covalent reaction between curing agent was confirmed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For an effective dispersion, the optimum weight ratio of EP-TDI-TX100 to VGCNFs is 2:1. The maximum VGCNF concentration that can be homogeneously dispersed in an aqueous solution is approximately 0.64 mg/mL. The EP-TDI-TX100 molecules are adsorbed on the VGCNF surface and prevent reaggregation of VGCNFs, so that a colloidal stability of VGCNF dispersion can be maintained for 6 months.

However, the dynamic response of the layered structure to temporal variations in applied potential is not well understood. We used in situ, real-time x-ray reflectivity to study the potential-dependent electric double layer (EDL) structure of an imidazolium-based RTIL on charged epitaxial graphene during potential cycling as a function of temperature. The results suggest that the graphene-RTIL interfacial structure is bistable in which the EDL structure at any intermediate potential can be described by the combination of two extreme-potential structures whose proportions vary depending on the polarity and magnitude of the applied potential. This picture is supported by the EDL structures obtained by fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations at various static potentials. The potential-driven transition between the two structures is characterized by an increasing width but with an approximately fixed hysteresis magnitude as a function of temperature. The results are consistent with the coexistence of distinct anion-and cation-adsorbed structures separated by an energy barrier (similar to 0.15 eV).

Nevertheless, the dendritic Li growth during repeated plating/stripping processes would cause fast capacity decay and serious safety concerns. The integration of porous current collectors with carbon nanomaterials has attracted special interest recently in suppression of Li dendrite growth. However, the large amounts of Li plating under high power conditions remain a major challenge for such hosts because most nanocarbons suffer from poor lithiophilicity. Herein, for the first time, nitrogen-doped graphdiyne nanowall-modified copper foam (N-GDY) is prepared as a highly lithiophilic host to achieve high-rate dendrite-free Li plating with high areal capacities. Such a N-GDY host features highly lithiophilic N-containing groups, abundant graphdiyne nanopores and a stable Li plating interface, guaranteeing a quite low nucleation overpotential of 13 mV and a plating/stripping coulombic efficiency of above 99.0% under synergistic conditions with high current density and areal capacity. Hence, the N-GDY@Li anode maintains a dendrite-free morphology and low voltage hysteresis under a harsh working condition for over 350 h, significantly outperforming the counterparts deposited on other carbon films. Furthermore, the N-GDY@Li anode-derived full cells also exhibit enhanced electrochemical performance towards practical applications of advanced LMBs.

Results showed high levels of BC in Southwest, Central, and East China, with maximum surface concentrations, column burden, and optical depth (AOD) up to 14 mu g m(-3), 8 mg m(-2), and 0.11, respectively. Black carbon was found to result in a positive RF at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) due to its direct effect while a negative RF due to its indirect effect. The regional-averaged direct and indirect RF of BC in China was about +0.81 and -0.95 W m(-2), respectively, leading to a net RF of -0.15 W m(-2) at the TOA. The BC indirect RF was larger than its direct RF in South China. Due to BC absorption of solar radiation, cloudiness was decreased by 1.33 %, further resulting in an increase of solar radiation and subsequently a surface warming over most parts of China, which was opposite to BC's indirect effect. Further, the net effect of BC might cause a decrease of precipitation of -7.39 % over China. Investigations also suggested large uncertainties and non-linearity in BC's indirect effect on regional climate. Results suggested that: (a) changes in cloud cover might be more affected by BC's direct effect, while changes in surface air temperature and precipitation might be influenced by BC's indirect effect; and (b) BC second indirect effect might have more influence on cloud cover and water content compared to first indirect effect.

Herein, a quantitative relationship between ion transport and relaxation behavior in the Li2S???CaS nanocomposite is revealed based on complex conductivity and electric modulus formalism. Li2S???CaS nanocomposites prepared by high-energy ball milling show higher conductivity and activation energy for conduction than pure Li2S. The activation energy for relaxation is lower than the activation energy for conduction in 80Li2S??20CaS (mol%). The long-range ion transport involves high activation energy compared with the hopping of carriers at localized states in 80Li2S??20CaS. Additionally, the dual doping of Ca and halogen reduces the activation energy for conduction and improves the conductivity of Li2S. The findings show important insight for understanding ion transport in nanocomposites containing a Li2S nanostructure.

Here, a precursor reforming strategy is developed to construct melamine precursor rods with an etched surface. After being calcinated, the morphology of the melamine precursor is transformed to interconnected vesicles with open characteristics. In addition, XPS analysis and DFT calculations demonstrate the formation of oxygen-containing groups in the open vesicles, thereby boosting charge separation for surface photocatalytic H-2 production. Such a synergistic regulation strategy produces superior visible-light photocatalytic activity (608.3 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), and the H-2 production rate is 4.43-times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. These findings suggest an accessible way to construct effective photocatalysts via a precursor reforming strategy that can efficiently boost carrier production and spatial separation.

The compression process consists of elastic, yield and hardening stages, and the number of twin significantly increases at the yield stage. During the compression process, the crystal rotation and non-basal slip caused by twin shear alternately dominate the deformation of the 1.0 wt.% CNTs/Mg composite. The CNTs existing at grain boundaries lead to stress concentration, and the stress concentration stimulates the formation of twins at the yield stage. The formed twins interact with dislocations, result in crystal rotation and promotion of the non-basal slip system at the hardening stage under the effect of twin shear, thus, improve the toughness of the CNTs/Mg composite.

Cycle life improved substantially when the uniformity of carbon distribution around the sulfur particles improved and electrode density increased, improving the overall structural integrity of the carbon matrix. Capacity fading in a high-energy-density cathode is mainly due to structural failure by physical crack propagations of the electrode structure and subsequent formation of the electrochemically irreversible Li2S layer at cracked surfaces of carbon particles or masses. The capacity fading due to these mechanisms appears to be reduced substantially and significantly by improved structural integrity with uniform pore structure of the carbon matrix. A Li/S cell containing a cathode fabricated by the improved technique cycled over 400 cycles without any severe structural damage of the electrode structure. (C) 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

The aptamer electrochemical biosensor was assembled using a mercury ion aptamer-functionalized AuNPs-modified glass carbon electrode (aptamer/(AuNPs/CS)(2)/GCE) capable of specifically detecting mercury ions through a T-Hg2+-T structure. The experimental results indicated the optimum electrochemical performance of the prepared aptamer biosensor when the (AuNPs/CS)(2)/GCE surface was modified with 1.0 mu M aptamer and incubated with Hg2+ for 60 min. Moreover, the aptamer biosensor exhibits a good linear relationship between the logarithm of the Hg2+ concentration and the DPV peak current in the range from 0.01 to 500 nM following the linearization equation I-p (mu A) = 2.59902 +0.2097 logC (R-2 = 0.9994) with a limit of detection as low as 0.005 nM. Therefore, the constructed aptamer biosensor provides a simple and sensitive approach for Hg2+ detection in aqueous solution with promising application for trace Hg2+ detection in real samples.

This work comprises on a functional catalytic material F-Mn-MOF-74 using an effective competitive coordination strategy, adenine (Ad) as alkali source and competitive ligand, introduced onto the synthetic Mn-MOF-74. An F-Mn-MOF-74 crystal having a spherical structure and being functionalized is obtained, and lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom in the adenine can compete with 2,5-hydroxyterephthalic acid for coordination. The alkalinity exhibited by adenine is beneficial to enhance the catalytic properties of the crystal in the cycloaddition reaction of epoxide with carbon dioxide. Further catalytic experiments showed that the functionalized F-Mn-MOF-74 crystal combined with tetrabutylammonium bromide in the lacking of solvent showed excellent catalytic activity in the cycloaddition reaction of styrene oxide and carbon dioxide. Under the optimal reaction conditions after screening (100 degrees C and 10 bar CO2 pressure), the yield of cyclic carbonate was as high as 99 %. The excellent catalytic performance for other epoxides also confirmed that F-Mn-MOF-74 catalytic material is universal in its application. The catalytic performance of the catalyst was not significantly decreased after being recycled seven times, attributed to its excellent stability. The possible mechanism for the synergistic effect of Lewis acid-base properties of functionalized F-Mn-MOF-74 catalytic material with cocatalyst is also proposed.

MWCNTs were dispersed in Mg-9Al matrix using an ionic gemini dispersant. Microstructural characterization studies revealed that MWCNTs can be individually dispersed with no structural damage. Matrix-MWCNT was found to be excellent (absence of voids and debonding). Results further revealed that the addition of MWCNTs significantly affected the size of Mg17Al12 phase, which decreased from micron to nano length scale. The tensile test results revealed that the elongation and ultimate tensile strength of Mg-9Al composite with 0.4 wt % MWCNTs content were 15% and 355 MPa, respectively, showing 150% and 18% enhancement in comparison to Mg-9Al alloy. The remarkably enhanced mechanical properties were mainly attributed to the uniformly distributed nanoscale Mg17Al12 s phase in composite and the excellent interface bonding between MWCNTs and matrix.

However, traditional recognition methods are almost focused on the single fluorescence mode and the interference from competitive metal ions can hardly be fully avoided. It is highly desirable to develop multiple-mode detection methods to guarantee the detection accuracy. Here, heteroatom N,S-co doped red emissive carbon dots (R-CDs) with high photoluminescence quantum yield (approximate to 23%) were prepared for sensing copper ions (Cu2+) selectively. Besides the fluorescence quenching effect by Cu2+, the change in the UV-vis absorption spectrum has been explored as an additional and exclusive sign for binding of Cu2+. Then, the unique coordination-assisted quenching mechanism was suggested to be responsible for both fluorescence quenching and absorption change. Furthermore, the highly selective and sensitive detection paper for Cu2+ has been efficiently developed. This work will pave the way toward sensing trace metal ions.

J	Demir-Cakan, R				Demir-Cakan, Rezan			Targeting the role of lithium sulphide formation for the rapid capacity fading in lithium-sulphur batteries	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Lithium sulphur batteries; Lithium sulphide; Capacity fade; Carbon-sulphur composite	LI-S BATTERIES; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; CATHODE; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; ELECTROLYTE; PARTICLES; CELL	This work aims to study the reasons for the rapid capacity fading in the field of lithium-sulphur batteries. It is found that the formation of non-soluble and insulating lithium sulphide, Li2S, upon sulphur reduction is one of the main reasons to account for the capacity fade due to its relatively low electrochemical activity and blocking of the carbon framework. A variety of analytical techniques are used to assess the formation of Li2S and visualize the resulting morphological changes in a mesoporous carbon/sulphur composite (MCS) during battery operation. It is shown that simply changing the cut-off voltages can alter retention and resistance of the cells during cycling. Since the electrochemical activity of lithium polysulphides decreases with the order, elimination of low order of polysulphides is considered critical. Thus, in order to oxidize the least sulphur reduction specie, Li2S, two different additives are suggested; namely an electrolyte additive, Lil, or an electrode additive, V2O5. Incorporation of the one of these components into the MCS composite enables the delivery of higher capacities (i.e. as compared to a bare C/S composite). The increased capacity is linked not only to the co-cathode materials, which contribute to the total capacity, but also to the oxidizing agent and internal redox mediator role of the additives.

However, many concrete structures in these places remain wet as a result of tides and wave-splashing, so they cannot be completely dried before repair. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the effects of moisture on the initial and long-termbond behavior between CFRP and wet concrete. This research assesses the effects of moisture (i) during CFRP application and (ii) throughout the service life. Before CFRP bonding, the concrete blocks are preconditioned with a water content of 4.73% (termed "wet-bonding"). Three different epoxy resins are applied to study the bond performance of the CFRP-concrete interface when subjected tomoisture (95% relative humidity). A total of 45 double-lap shear specimens were tested at the beginning of exposure and again after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. All specimens with normal epoxy resins exhibited adhesive failure. The failure mode of specimens with hydrophobic epoxy resin changed from cohesive failure to mixed cohesive/adhesive failure and to adhesive failure according to the duration of exposure. Under moisture conditioning, the maximum shear stress (tau(max)) and corresponding slip (s(max)) of the bond-slip curve first increased and then decreased or fluctuated over time. The same tendency was seen in the ultimate strain transmitted to the CFRP sheet, the interfacial fracture energy (G(f)),and the ultimate load (P-u). Analytical models of G(f) and P-u for the CFRP-concrete interface under moisture conditioning are presented.

The Electrical Double Layer of Dicationic Ionic Liquids at Onion-like Carbon Surface	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATION; DIFFERENTIAL CAPACITANCE; IMIDAZOLIUM; INTERFACE; SUPERCAPACITORS; ELECTROLYTES; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODES; MERCURY; MODEL	The electrical double layer (EDL) structure formed by ions at a charged surface, which is the key to determining the performance of supercapacitors, has been extensively studied for many monocationic ionic liquids (MILs). However, it is not known what effect replacing MILs with dicationic ionic liquids (DILs) will have on the EDL structure. In this work, the interfacial structure and electrochemical performance of DILs [C-n(mim)(2)](BF4)(2) (n = 3, 6, 9) and [C-6(mim)(2)](Tf2N)(2) were investigated using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for comparison with their monocationic counterparts. Different EDL structures formed by DILs and MILs near an onion-like carbon (OLC) electrode were observed. The interfacial orientation of the imidazolium plane in dications was verified to be similar to that of monocations. Moreover, the dissimilar sizes of the cation/anion and the specific ion adsorption on OLC were found to contribute to the distinctive shape of the differential capacitance-electric potential (C-V) curves, which were also dependent on the type of anions. Increased capacitance in BF4-containing DILs was not observed in comparison with their counterpart MILs, whereas dicationic [C-6(mim)(2)](Tf2N)(2) yielded higher differential capacitance in contrast to monocationic [C(6)mim][Tf2N], which was substantiated by cyclic voltammetry measurements as well. This work provides molecular insights into the EDL structure and C-V curves of imidazolium-based DILs in OLC-based supercapacitors.

In the present study, we report a facile and efficient method to synthesize a CDs-based nanohybrid bearing a multi-hydroxy hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG) shell by combing a "grafting from" method with an anionic ring-opening polymerization technique. The resultant CDs-g-HPG had high water-dispersibility, low cytotoxicity, improved hemocompatibility and strong green fluorescence.

The temperature dependence of the G-band peak shift in the BP was found to depend on the reduction in residual surfactant and nanotube oxidation. The electrical conductivity was improved after removing the surfactant and increasing the nanotube alignment, although the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity still followed a variable range hopping conduction behavior. The mechanical properties were affected by the degree of entanglement, alignment, and residual surfactant content, and tensile properties were found to improve with the reduction in surfactant and enhancement of alignment.

National forest inventory (NFI) is considered the main source of data for reporting forest carbon stocks and changes to UNFCCC. However, NFI samples are often collected asynchronously across regions in intervals of 5-10 years or sub-sampled annually, both introducing uncertainties in estimating annual carbon stock changes by missing a wide range of forest disturbance and recovery processes. Here, we integrate satellite observations with forest inventory data across the conterminous United States to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of NFI for estimating annual carbon stocks and changes. We used more than 120 000 permanent plots from the US forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data, surveyed periodically at sampling rate of 15%-20% per year across the US to develop non-parametric remote sensing-based models of aboveground biomass carbon density (AGC) at 1 ha spatial resolution for the years 2005, 2010, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The model provided a relatively unbiased estimation of AGC compared to ground inventory estimates at plot, county, and state scales. The uncertainty of the biomass maps and their contributions to estimates of forest carbon stock changes at county and state levels were quantified. Our results suggest that adding spatial and temporal dimensions to the forest inventory data, will significantly improve the accuracy and precision of carbon stocks and changes at jurisdictional scales.

The optimal glucose/glycerol weight ratio was 30/30; this resulted in a maximum epsilon-PL productivity of 5.26 g/L/d. Glucose and glycerol were consumed synergistically during the co-fermentation process, and the length of time during which the substrate was exhausted was significantly shortened compared with the single carbon source fermentation. Under optimized conditions, fed-batch fermentations with glucose and glycerol as a mixed carbon source achieved maximum epsilon-PL concentration and productivity values of 35.14 g/L and 4.85 g/L/d, respectively. These values were respectively 1.43- and 1.39-, and 1.17- and 1.16-folds higher than those obtained from fermentations with glucose and glycerol as single carbon sources. The present study is the first to suggest that glucose/glycerol co-fermentation may be an efficient strategy for epsilon-PL production by Streptomyces sp. M-Z18.

After 50 cycles, a high capacity of 631 mA h g(-1) is maintained, compared to 203 mA h g(-1) for the Li-S battery with conventional configuration. Moreover, the coulombic efficiency is increased to near 100% from around 94%. This improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the new cell configuration, because the graphite film greatly retains the active material by alleviating the polysulphide shuttling problem and providing extra reaction sites for sulphur species.

Owing to the unique structure with abundant micro/meso-pores, the highly-conductive C-Co-N matrix provides highly-efficient channels for electron transfer and ionic diffusion, and sufficient surface area for loading of selenium nanoparticles while mitigating dissolution of polyselenides and suppressing volume expansion. The homogenous distribution of cobalt nanoparticles and nitrogen-group in C-Co-N composite immobilize polyselenides through strong chemical interaction in the operation of Li-Se batteries. With a very high Se loading of 76.5 wt%, the C-Co-N/Se cathode delivers superior electrochemical performance with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 672.3 mAh g(-1) (99.6% of the theoretical value) and a capacity of 574.2 mAh g(-1) after 200 cycles, giving a capacity fading of only 0.07% per cycle and a nearly 100% Columbic efficiency. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory simulations are employed to investigate the Se (de)lithiation mechanism at the electrolyte/cathode interface, and confirm that the structure and composition of C-Co-N scaffold give rise to efficient cathode host for high-performance Se-based cathodes with dramatically reduced capacity fading.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption, UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM, N2-TPD, EPR, photoluminescence (PL) and photocurrent measurements were used to characterize the prepared catalysts. The results indicate that microwave treatment can form many irregular pores in as-prepared g-C3N4, which causes the increased surface area and separation rate of electrons and holes. More importantly, microwave treatment causes the formation of many nitrogen vacancies in as-prepared g-C3N4. These nitrogen vacancies not only serve as active sites to adsorb and activate N-2 molecules but also promote interfacial charge transfer from catalysts to N-2 molecules, thus significantly improving the nitrogen photofixation ability. Moreover, the present process is a convenient method for large-scale production of g-C3N4 which is significantly important for the practical application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using non-metabolizable and metabolizable sugars as substrates, we found that cellobiose, galactose, arabinose and starch utilization was strongly inhibited by the existence of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). However, the xylose and mannose consumptions were not markedly affected by 2-DG at the concentration of one-tenth of the metabolizable sugar. Accordingly, T. aotearoense SCUT27 could consume xylose and mannose in the presence of glucose. The carbon catabolite repression (CCR) related genes, ccpA, ptsH and hprK were confirmed to exist in T. aotearoense SCUT27 through gene cloning and protein characterization. The highly purified Histidine-containing Protein (HPr) could be specifically phosphorylated at Serine 46 by HPr kinase/phosphatase (HPrK/P) with no need to add fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) or glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) in the reaction mixture. The specific protein-interaction of catabolite control protein A (CcpA) and phosphorylated HPr was proved via affinity chromatography in the absence of formaldehyde. The equilibrium binding constant (K-D) of CcpA and HPrSerP was determined as 2.22 +/- 0.36 nM by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, indicating the high affinity between these two proteins.

Experimental results indicated that mechanical properties of dynamically vulcanized HIPS/SBS/SBR blends were enhanced remarkably by the incorporation of CB. The fracture surface morphology of the reinforced HIPS/SBS/SBR/CB TPVs was relatively flat. The Mullins effect could be observed in the stress-strain curves of HIPS/SBS/SBR TPVs and HIPS/SBS/SBR/CB TPVs during the uniaxial loading-unloading cycles. Compared with HIPS/SBS/SBR TPVs, CB-reinforced HIPS/SBS/SBR TPVs had the relatively higher stress, residual strain and internal friction loss.

Herein, we report an arc discharge strategy coupled with an controllable oxidation to prepare Co/Co3O4 nanoparticles confined in ultrathin O-doped graphitic carbon layer (Co/Co3O4 @ODGC) as highly active bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The resultant Co/Co3O4 @ODGC shows an impressive ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.80 V in 0.1 M KOH. It also exhibits remarkable OER performance with a small overpotential of 300 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Both experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the high ORR and OER activities are attributed to the synergistic electronic effect between the Co/Co3O4 hetemstructures and ultrathin O-doped graphitic layer (similar to 1.5 nm). Particularly, the electron redistribution in graphitic layer caused by O-doping and carbon defects significantly decreases the energy barrier for oxygen adsorption/desorption. More attractively, the as-constructed ZABs with Co/Co3O4@ODGC cathode show an impressive open voltage (1.60 V), a high power density of 107 mW cm(-2), and good stability without nearly no performance decay for 40 h at 2.0 mA cm(-2). This work provides both fundamental understanding and easy strategy for developing the efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for high performance metal-air batteries.

Effects of irrigation and tillage on soil organic carbon and nutrients in mining-induced subsided cropland	SOIL RESEARCH			English	Article						land subsidence; mine areas; soil erosion; soil management; soil quality	EROSION; WATER; SOC; REDISTRIBUTION; RECLAMATION; PHOSPHORUS; PATTERNS; NITROGEN; CS-137	Little is known about the effect of field management on soil quality in mining subsidence landscapes. In this study, we selected subsided cropland from the Jiaozuo coal mining district, China, to determine the effects of irrigation and tillage on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrients. Irrigation and tillage differentially affected the dynamics of SOC, total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) in subsided cropland at 15-18 years after surface subsidence. Tillage along a longitudinal slope-direction induced greater depletions of SOC, N and P stocks in subsided cropland compared with tillage along a transverse slope-direction (T-T). These parameters were also more depleted under rainfed than under irrigated conditions. The distribution of SOC, total N and total P was related to soil redistribution by soil erosion in subsided cropland. Integrated irrigation-T-T management reduced the within-field variations in SOC, total N and total P, and irrigation reduced within-field variation in SOC. These results indicate the effects of tillage and irrigation on soil erosion and subsequently on SOC and nutrients in subsided cropland. Practicing tillage over great subsidence gradients is detrimental to soil conservation. Combining small subsidence gradients with irrigation may be an alternative to traditional engineering reclamation of subsided cropland.	[Nie, X. J.; Zhang, H. B.; Li, S.

RT Na-S batteries, however, usually suffer from sluggish reaction kinetics, low reversible capacity, and short lifespans. Herein, it is shown that chain-mail catalysts, consisting of porous nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) encapsulating Co nanoparticles (Co@PCNFs), can activate sulfur via electron engineering. The chain-mail catalysts Co@PCNFs with a micrograde hierarchical structure as a freestanding sulfur cathode (Co@PCNFs/S) can provide space for high mass loading of sulfur and polysulfides. The electrons can rapidly transfer from chain-mail catalysts to sulfur and polysulfides during discharge-charge processes, therefore boosting its conversion kinetics. As a result, this freestanding Co@PCNFs/S cathode achieves a high sulfur loading of 2.1 +/- 0.2 mg cm(-2), delivering a high reversible capacity of 398 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C (1 C = 1675 mA g(-1)) over 600 cycles and superior rate capability of an average capacity of 240 mA h g(-1) at 5 C. Experimental results, combined with density functional theory calculations, demonstrate that the Co@PCNFs/S can efficiently improve the conversion kinetics between the polysulfides and Na2S via transferring electrons from Co to them, thereby realizing efficient sulfur redox reactions.

In Situ Growth of Carbon Nanotubes on Ti Powder for Strengthening of Ti Matrix Composite via Nanotube-Particle Dual Morphology	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; NANOSTRUCTURED CARBON; PHASE EVOLUTION; ARCHITECTURE; CRYSTALLIZATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOCOMPOSITES; METALLURGY; DEPOSITION	In situsynthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on Ti powder decorated with Ni catalyst enabled us to obtain a high-quality CNTs/Ti composite powderviafluidized bed chemical vapor deposition (FBCVD) process. The composite powder was characterized by a combination of high structural integrity and uniform dispersion of CNTs, which is not obtained by traditional ball-milling route. These advantages enabled the retention of CNTs in the near-fully dense titanium matrix composite (TMC), together with the uniform dispersion of TiC particles. The CNTs and TiC particles coordinated with each other and contributed to a synergistic effect involving load transfer from the matrix to CNTs and dispersion strengthening of TiC particles. The nanotube-particle-reinforced TMC exhibited superior mechanical properties in comparison to single-phase-reinforced TMCs. The catalytic behavior of Ni,controllablesynthesis of CNTs,theretention behavior of CNTs, and the formation mechanism of TiC particles during the sintering process are discussed in detail.

The obtained delta-MnO2/HCS nanocomposite possesses a unique hollow structure, which exhibited excellent adsorption of electrolyte ions and macromolecules. When used as electrode for supercapacitors (SCs), it exhibits excellent electrochemical ability. The specific capacitance is 370 F/g at 5 mV/s, and 93.3% of the initial capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles. Additionally, when delta-MnO2/HCS acted as a catalyst for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA), the removal rate is 95% within 10 min and BPA is almost entirely decomposed in 30 min. This multifunctional delta-MnO2/HCS composite may find novel applications in future environmentally friendly energy technologies.

Here, a chainmail design is proposed to enable the electronic interaction of ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon shell with Ni2P nanorod core arrayed on nickel foam (Ni2P@NC/NF) for simulta-neously promoting the activity and stability in both alkaline and neutral hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The easy penetration of valence electrons from active Ni2P core to NC shell enables the obvious improvement of HER performance compared to pure Ni2P. In 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS solution, the resultant Ni2P@NC/NF requires the ultralow overpotentials of only 93 and 96 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm-2 with the Faradaic efficiency of 96% and 94%, respectively. Remarkably, such a chainmail design also reveals an obviously improved stability with almost negligible performance degradation under the current density of 20 mA cm-2 for 30 h. Theoretical calculations confirm that the nitrogen -doped carbon shell improves the durability of transition metal phosphides by increasing the dissolution resistance of Ni atoms. The proposed concept may create a new pathway for synchronizing high activity and robust stability in manipulating heterogeneous catalytic properties. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Therefore, further efforts are still needed to improve the catalytic performance of peroxidase nanozymes. Herein, we synthesized Fe-coordinated carbon nanozyme dots (Fe-CDs) that can serve as both efficient peroxidase nanozymes and T-2-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. The intrinsic peroxidase-like activity of the Fe-CDs was explored by catalytic oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The product showed better performance over natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and other mimetic peroxidases. Quantification of glucose and ascorbic acid detection showed that this nanozyme could be used to detect a minimum limit as low as 5 mu M glucose. Moreover, the colorimetric detection technique was used to detect serum glucose in mice, and the detection result was comparable with autobiochemistry analyzer results using a glucose assay kit. Furthermore, the Fe-CDs showed good magnetism properties and provided promising MR imaging of tumors with excellent biocompatibility.

Investigating the ecosystem WUE contributes to a better understanding of the water-carbon coupling mechanism in ecosystems. We explored the responses of the daily ecosystem WUE (WUEe) and canopy WUE (WUEc) to several influential factors, the dominant biophysical factor and the dominant water/carbon flux component of the difference between WUEe and WUEc based on continuous measurements collected via an eddy covariance system, sap flow system, and microlysimeters over two growing seasons from 2017 to 2018 in a sparse vineyard in northwestern China. The results showed that the seasonal averages for WUEe and WUEc were 0.52 g C kg H2O-1 and 1.96 g C kg H2O-1, respectively. WUEe and WUEc responded weakly to the air temperature (Ta) and showed a negative linear correlation to the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). WUEe decreased significantly with the rising soil water content (SWC) while WUEc showed a weak response. Both WUEe and WUEc exhibited positive linear relationships with the leaf area index (LAI). The results from a structural equation model (SEM) indicated that among the biophysical controllers, SWC and LAI were the top two controlling factors on the difference between WUEe and WUEc, and SWC played a dominant role. The difference between WUEe and WUEc increased with the rising SWC and decreased with the rising LAI. Among the flux components, including soil evaporation (E), transpiration (T), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and ecosystem respiration (R-eco), E dominated the discrepancy between WUEe and WUEc due to the strong control of SWC on E. This study highlights the strong control by the SWC in regulating the ecosystem WUE under a sparse canopy in an arid area.

We found that the stack pressure during charging and discharging heals microcracks in ASSBs, which imparts long-term cyclability in a composite anode made of graphite and solid-state electrolyte (SE, Li6PS5(Cl,Br)). The microcracks were generated when a fabrication pressure of 400 MPa was released but were mechanically bonded under a stack so i pressure of 40 MPa during cycle tests. They healed further due to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at the binder layer with a thickness of approximately 100 nm between the Cycle number mechanically contacted graphite and SE. In this crack healing process, the binder served as medium for the movement of Li, S, and O atoms and as the location for the amorphous SEI layer formation. The SEI layer was primarily similar to that of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), which contained small amounts of sulfur, in terms of the chemical composition and chemical bond. The binder in the ASSB changed to a lithium carbonate SEI regardless of the stack pressure. In the absence of the stack pressure, the ASSB cells maintained the initial structure of the binder and crack in the pristine cell and were degraded with the crucial expansion of the microcracks between electrode materials. The stack pressure was most effective in mitigating the capacity reduction of ASSBs because it induced mechanical and chemical crack healing, which restored the conduction pathways between the graphite and SE particles. The mechanical and structural understanding acquired in this study is expected to provide research angles for sustainable, cost-effective, and high-performance graphite/argyrodite-based ASSB design and fabrication.

Benefiting from the expanded interlayer spacing and high surface area, the obtained carbon exhibited an excellent electrochemical sodium ion storage performance with a high reversible capacity of similar to 310 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles between 3.0 and 0.01 V (vs Na+/Na) at a constant current density of similar to 0.1 A g(-1). More importantly, an excellent rate capability of similar to 120.6 mAh g(-1) after 5000 cycles was delivered at a rather high current density of 5 A g(-1), which is almost the best among the biomass-derived carbon anodes. The excellent performance of SLPC for SIBs may be attributed to the fast capacitance behavior and rapid mass transfer process profiting from porous structure of the carbon existing in biological tissue. Considering the superior low cost and excellent electrochemical sodium storage performance of SLPC, the SLPC might be a highly promising anode material for the practical application of SIBs.

The results demonstrated that the pre-mixed powdered activated carbons mitigated the fouling, and the fouling control efficiency increased with the increase in powdered activated carbon size and with the decrease in membrane pore size and permeate flux. In comparison to the gradually formed cake layer in the conventional dosing mode, the pre-deposited layer on the membrane surface exhibited significantly more complicated reactions to these parameters. The interactions between pre-deposited powdered activated carbons and algal foulants changed from synergistic fouling to buffering effects that were highly associated with the storage capacity of the pre-deposited layer and cell rearrangement through the depth of the layer. Thus, contrary to the pre-mixed powdered activated carbons, the pre-deposited powdered activated carbons reduced the fouling resistance under high permeate drag force because of the limited algal cell transference into the powdered activated carbon layer caused by the increasing compactness of the initially formed foulant layer. This study demonstrated the feasibility of controlling fouling through pre-deposited powdered activated carbons and benefitted the selection of the optimal adsorbent dosing mode based on operational conditions.

However, its charge storage mechanism is unclear, hindering further improvement of the cell performance. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques as well as theoretical analysis, it is found that a large anisotropic volume expansion of 142% occurs along the z-axis largely due to the alloy reaction during sodiation, significantly reducing the electrochemical performance of bismuth electrodes. To address this problem, ultrathin few-layer bismuthene with a large aspect ratio is rationally synthesized, and can relieve the expansion strain along the z-axis. A free-standing bismuthene/graphene composite electrode with tunable thickness achieves a strikingly stable and high areal sodium storage capacity of 12.1 mAh cm(-2), which greatly exceeds that of most reported electrode materials. The clarification of the charge storage mechanism and the superior areal capacity achieved should facilitate the development of bismuth-based high-performance anodes for practical electrochemical energy-storage applications.

First rheological properties and foaming behaviors of PLGA and PCL were studied in detail. Compared with PLGA, PCL had lower viscosity with loss tangent tan delta over 1 thus got bigger and highly interconnected pores after foaming. Based on this, membranes with distinct porous PCL and PLGA bilayer were prepared via a one-step foaming. SEM showed the pore size of the PCL layer was 80-100 mu m, and that of the PLGA layer was less than 10 mu m. Through tensile tests these membranes exhibited a tensile strength of 4.02 MPa and a elongation at break of 57.7 %, meeting the mechanical requirements of GTR. Further cell tests demonstrated that the PCL layer suited for the proliferation of osteoblasts and the PLGA layer inhibited the ingrowth of fibroblasts. The porous PLGA/PCL bilayer membranes fabricated using this one-step foaming meet the requirements of GTR and possess great commercial potential. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Biological responses of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films with different structures in biomedical application	MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						DLC film; Macrophages; Osteoblasts; Fibroblasts; Biocompatibility	IN-VITRO; STAINLESS-STEEL; COATINGS; COCRMO; ALLOY; WEAR; OSSEOINTEGRATION; CONDUCTIVITY; FIBROBLASTS; FABRICATION	Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are potential candidates for artificial joint surface modification in biomedical applications, and the influence of the structural features of DLC surfaces on cell functions has attracted attention in recent decades. Here, the biocompatibility of DLC films with different structures was investigated using macrophages, osteoblasts and fibroblasts. The results showed that DLC films with a low ratio of sp(2)/sp(3), which tend to have a structure similar to that of diamond, led to less inflammatory, excellent osteogenic and fibroblastic reactions, with higher cell viability, better morphology, lower release of TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and IL-6 (interleukin-6), and higher release of IL-10 (interleukin-10). The results also demonstrated that the high-density diamond structure (low ratio of sp(2)/sp(3)) of DLC films is beneficial for cell adhesion and growth because of better protein adsorption without electrostatic repulsion. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying inhibition of an inflammatory response and the promotion of osteoblastogenesis and fibrous propagation, and effectively build a system for evaluating the biocompatibility of DLC films.

J	Du, HQ; Wang, T; Xue, X; Li, S				Du, Heqiang; Wang, Tao; Xue, Xian; Li, Sen			Estimation of soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus losses induced by wind erosion in Northern China	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						PM10; SOC; TN; TP; wind erosion	INNER MONGOLIA REACH; DUST EMISSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YELLOW-RIVER; LAND-USE; MODEL; IMPACT; PLATEAU; DESERTIFICATION; CONSISTENCY	The loss of nutrients induced by wind erosion causes serious land degradation. Northern China suffers from severe wind erosion that causes massive amounts of soil nutrients to be lost and results in land degradation. To thoroughly comprehend the mechanisms of land degradation in Northern China, the spatiotemporal distribution of nutrients losses induced by wind erosion must be considered. Therefore, in this study, a wind erosion model was employed to obtain the PM10 emissions in Northern China from 2001 to 2014, and the quantities of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) entrained by PM10 were obtained using the integrated soil database of China. The results showed that the losses of SOC, TN, and TP induced by wind erosion were 0.894, 0.184, and 0.123 Tg/a, respectively, and the spatial distributions of these three nutrients differed from one another. According to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land-cover data, the nutrients lost from desert ecosystems contributed the largest fractions of the total nutrients lost in Northern China, and the fractions of SOC, TN, and TP losses from the desert ecosystems all exceeded 50%. Following the desert ecosystems, the grassland ecosystems also had higher fractions of nutrients losses. The farmland ecosystems, which were the most severely impacted by human activities, contributed to less than 10% of the total nutrients losses.

An electric field has been proven to be an effective factor to control the water flow, because water molecules form a typical polar liquid that is sensitive to the external field. However, to the best of our knowledge, previous work has mostly focused on electric fields along the channel axis direction, while the effect of a non-axial field is rarely explored. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of a lateral electric field on pressure-driven single-file water transport through a (6,6) carbon nanotube (CNT). Of particular interest is that the water flux exhibits a monotonous reduction with an increase in the lateral electric field, suggesting an on-off gating behavior. This is because the lateral electric field disrupts the hydrogen bond connections in a single-file water chain, which ultimately leads to a reduction in water occupancy. Notably, the results strongly depend on the CNT length, where for long CNTs, the single-file water chain can be broken down at small field strengths, resulting in a more drastic reduction in flux and occupancy. This is because a long single-file water chain can be less affected by the outside reservoirs and should be more susceptible to the lateral electric field. The water translocation time, dipole orientation and flipping are also sensitive to the field strength. Furthermore, under high field strength, the increase in pressure difference results in an increase in water occupancy and reformation of the single-file water chain, which ultimately leads to an increase in flux. On the whole, the lateral electric field causes a liquid-to-vapor phase transition for the confined water, while the pressure difference has the opposite function. Our results demonstrate that a lateral electric field strongly affects the dynamics of single-file water chains, and should have great implications in the design of novel gating nanofluidic devices.

The reasonable design and construction of bifunctional electrocatalysts is the key to energy storage and energy conversion technologies. In this study, transition metal carbon nitrides were used as a substitute for the precious metal catalyst, the Ni-Co-BTC (metal organic framework (MOF)) mixed with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) using electrostatic spinning technology to prepare the bamboo-like nanofibers precursor (Ni-Co-BTC@PAN). A series of electrocatalytic materials (NiCo-X@N-CNFs-Ts, T = 700, 800, 900 degrees C) were synthesized with nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers coated with NiCo alloy nanoparticles using high temperature carbonization at different temperatures. We studied the effects of different calcination temperatures and different Ni/Co molar ratios of NiCo-X@N-CNFs-Ts (T = 700, 800, 900 degrees C) on the bifunctional catalytic performance of the ORR/OER. The composite, NiCo-0.8@N-CNFs-800, exhibited a highly doped-N level, uniform NiCo alloy nanoparticle dispersion and decentralized NiCo-N-x active sites, therefore affording an excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. The ORR onset potential on NiCo-0.8@N-CNFs-800 was 0.91 V and the half-wave potential (E-1/2) was 0.82 V, the NiCo-0.8@N-CNFs-800 corresponded to the minimum potential of 1.61 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) among all of the NiCo-X@N-CNFs-Ts hybrids under the OER condition. The NiCo-0.8@N-CNFs-800 catalyst exhibited a low reversible overpotential of 0.79 V between the ORR (E-1/2) and OER (E-j = 10 mA cm(-2)) with excellent stability, durability and methanol tolerance, even surprisingly superior to the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a general strategy and useful guidance for the design and development of a variety of multifunctional non-noble metal catalysts for energy applications.

Here, we apply an up-to-date emission inventory of BC in 2006 to investigate its loading, optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm and DRF using the coupled Regional Climate Chemistry Modeling System (RegCCMS). A state of the art air quality model (WRF/Chem) is also used to access surface BC concentration. Simulated surface concentrations of BC from these two models were compared with observations, while the AOD was compared with the results both from the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model and from satellite and ground-based simulations. Results show that RegCCMS presented similar patterns and levels of annual mean-surface BC concentration to those of WRF/Chem. The regional distributions and monthly variations of RegCCMS BC were reproduced well in comparison to observations. Simulated pattern of AODs are consistent to but lower than those from satellite (Omi-0.25A degrees) and AERONET simulations. Annual mean DRFs mainly distribute in the area with high BC loadings, with regional mean of 0.75 W m(-2) and predicted global mean of 0.343 W m(-2). In general, the results are about 0.4-5 times for regional column burden, about 2 times as high for regional mean DRFs, about 1.3-1.8 times for global mean DRFs and about 3-4 times for AOD at 550 nm as compared to those in previous studies in China. These increasing DRFs of BC imply that its warming effect and climate response should be stronger and the DRF of total aerosols should be weaker (less negative).

In this study, a 7-day field campaign was conducted in 2019 in a busy urban tunnel (>30,000 vehicles day(-1)) in south China with filter-based aerosol samples collected every 2 h at both the inlet and the outlet for measuring carbonaceous aerosols and their light absorbing properties. Observed fleet average emission factor (EF) of total carbon (TC) was 13.4 +/- 8.3 mgveh(-1) km(-1), and 17.4 +/- 11.3 mg veh(-1) km(-1) if electric and LPG-driven vehicles were excluded; and fleet average EF of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) was 8.5 +/- 6.6 and 4.9 +/- 2.6 mg veh(-1) km(-1) (11.0 +/- 8.8 and 6.3 +/- 3.6 mg veh(-1) km(-1) if excluding electric and LPG vehicles), respectively. Regression analysis revealed an average TC-EF of 319.8 mg veh(-1) km(-1) for diesel vehicles and 2.1 mg veh(-1) km(-1) for gasoline vehicles, and although diesel vehicles only shared similar to 4% in the fleet compositions, they still dominate on-road vehicular carbonaceous aerosol emissions due to their over 150 times higher average TC-EF than gasoline vehicles. Filter-based light absorption measurement demonstrated that on average brown carbon (BrC) could account for 19.1% of the total carbonaceous light absorption at 405 nm, and the average mass absorption efficiency of EC at 635 nm and that of OC at 405 nm were 5.2 m(2) g(-1) C and 1.0 m(2) g(-1) C, respectively.

However, traditional powdery nanomaterials are limited by drawbacks of difficult separation and lack of synergistic function, which do not conform to the practical demand. Herein, we developed a simple one-step gelation-pyrolysis route to fabricate hydrophilic three-dimensional (3D) porous photocatalytic adsorbent, in which CuO nanoparticles are uniformly and firmly embedded in nitrogen-doped (N-doped) porous carbon frameworks. The obtained N-doped carbon/CuO bulky composites exhibited excellent ability to adsorb tetracycline hydrochloride (TC), which was subsequently photo-oxidized under visible light. Their hydrophilic nature favors the adsorption processes toward TC, with a maximum adsorption capacity reaching 25.03 mg.g(-1). In addition, >94.4% of TC molecules could be photo-degraded in 4 h with good cycling efficiency after three consecutive tests. Finally, a reaction scheme for removal process of TC was proposed. The obtained 3D porous N-doped carbon/CuO nanocomposites show great promise for efficient removal of antibiotics in aqueous solution by synergistically utilizing adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation processes.

However, the rational design of carbon catalysts with high intrinsic activity remains a long-term goal. Herein, we report a new N-molecule-assisted self-catalytic carbonization process in augmenting the intrinsic Fenton-like activity of metal-organic-framework-derived carbon hybrids. During carbonization, the N-molecules provide alkane/ammonia gases and the formed iron nanocrystals act as the in situ catalysts, which result in the elaborated formation of carbon nanotubes (in situ chemical vapor deposition from alkane/iron catalysts) and micro-/meso-porous structures (ammonia gas etching). The obtained catalysts exhibited with abundant Fe/Fe-N-x/pyridinic-N active species, micro-/meso-porous structures, and conductive carbon nanotubes. Consequently, the catalysts exhibit high efficiency toward the degradation of different organic pollutions, such as bisphenol A, methylene blue, and tetracycline. This study not only creates a new pathway for achieving highly active Fenton-like carbon catalysts but also takes a step toward the customized production of advanced carbon hybrids for diverse energy and environmental applications.

Gel Electrophoresis Method to Measure the Concentration of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Extracted from Biological Tissue	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED FLUORESCENCE; CELLS; SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSPORTERS; ENDOCYTOSIS; PROTEINS	A rapid and sensitive method to detect single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in biological samples is presented. The method uses polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by quantification of SWNT bands. SWNTs dispersed in bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used to develop the method. When BSA-SWNT dispersions were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE, BSA passed through the stacking gel, entered the resolving gel, and migrated toward the anode as expected. The SWNTs, however, accumulated in a sharp band at the interface between the loading well and the stacking gel. The intensities from digitized images of these bands were proportional to the amount of SWNTs loaded onto the gel with a detection limit of 5 ng of SWNTs. To test the method, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells in culture were allowed to take up SWNTs upon exposure to medium containing various concentrations of BSA-SWNTs for different times and temperatures. The SDS-PAGE analyses of cell lysate samples suggest that BSA-SWNTs enter NRK cells by fluid-phase endocytosis at a rate of 30 fg/day/cell upon exposure to medium containing 98 mu g/mL SWNTs.

This is mainly due to the positive effect of the functional separators for efficiently inhibiting the shuttle effect of soluble polysulfide. Based on this reason, MoS2 coated separators are prepared and used as an efficient barrier for inhibiting shuttle effect in the Li-S battery. The as-prepared MoS2 coated separators exhibit perfect wettability. Therefore, the whole battery could achieve rapid Li-ion diffusion. Besides, the metal sulfide MoS2 provides chemical adsorption for the polysulfide. As a result, comparing with the pristine separator, the Li-S battery that used MoS2 coated separator shows higher specific capacity and more excellent cycle stability.

Tethered Molecular Sorbents: Enabling Metal-Sulfur Battery Cathodes	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article							RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM BATTERIES; ELECTROLYTE; COMPOSITES; NANOTUBES; CAPACITY	A rechargeable battery that uses sulfur at the cathode and a metal (e.g., Li, Na, Mg, or Al) at the anode provides perhaps the most promising path to a solid-state, rechargeable electrochemical storage device capable of high charge storage capacity. It is understood that solubilization in the electrolyte and loss of sulfur in the form of long-chain lithium polysulfi des (Li2Sx, 2 < x < 8) has hindered development of the most studied of these devices, the rechargeable Li-S battery. Beginning with density-functional calculations of the structure and interactions of a generic lithium polysulfi de species with nitrile containing molecules, it is shown that it is possible to design nitrile-rich molecular sorbents that anchor to other components in a sulfur cathode and which exert high-enough binding affinity to Li2Sx to limit its loss to the electrolyte. It is found that sorbents based on amines and imidazolium chloride present barriers to dissolution of long-chain Li2Sx and that introduction of as little as 2 wt% of these molecules to a physical sulfur-carbon blend leads to Li-S battery cathodes that exhibit stable long-term cycling behaviors at high and low charge/discharge rates.

Herein, multi-functional capacitive deionization (CDI) electrodes were developed for the simultaneous decontamination of bacteria and heavy metal contaminants. Polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG), an antibacterial polymer, was deposited on the surface of the activated carbon (AC) electrode with the assistance of mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) chemistry. The main characterization results proved successful co-deposition of PDA and PHMG on the AC electrode, forming a hydrophilic coating layer in one step. Electrochemical analyses indicated that the AC-PDA/PHMG electrodes presented satisfactory capacitive behaviors, with outstanding salt adsorption capacity and cycling stability. The modified electrodes also exhibit excellent disinfection performance and heavy metal adsorption performance. The bacterial elimination rate of co-deposited electrodes grew along with the increase in the PHMG content. Particularly, AC-PDA/PHMG(2) electrodes successfully removed and deactivated 99.11% Escherichia coli and 98.67% Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10(4) CFU mL(-1)) in water within 60 min. Furthermore, three flow cells made by AC-PDA/PHMG(2) electrodes connected in series achieved efficient removal of salt, heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, and bacteria simultaneously, which indicated that the adsorption performance is significantly improved compared with pristine AC electrodes. These results denote the enormous potential of this one-step prepared multi-functional electrodes for facile and effective water purification using CDI technology.

However, the formation of stable Li2O discharge product increases the overpotential during the charging process, which compromises the cell performance because of the resulting parasitic reaction. In this study, we demonstrate a potent approach to reversibly operate an oxygen-gas-reservoir-free Li-O-2 battery by using chemically impregnated nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles as a catalyst on the carbon electrode. The efficient bottom-up process for decorating NiO on a carbon material in binary molten electrolyte enables not only to significantly reduce the loading level of the catalyst but also to enhance the electrochemical performance with preventing the detrimental parasitic reaction in the oxygen-gas-reservoir-free Li-O-2 cell. In particular, using the in situ gas analysis with electrochemical measurements, the 20 wt% NiO added to the carbon cathode is sufficient to reduce the charging potential without generation of parasitic gas evolution.

Herein, multi-functional capacitive deionization (CDI) electrodes were developed for the simultaneous decontamination of bacteria and heavy metal contaminants. Polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG), an antibacterial polymer, was deposited on the surface of the activated carbon (AC) electrode with the assistance of mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA) chemistry. The main characterization results proved successful co-deposition of PDA and PHMG on the AC electrode, forming a hydrophilic coating layer in one step. Electrochemical analyses indicated that the AC-PDA/PHMG electrodes presented satisfactory capacitive behaviors, with outstanding salt adsorption capacity and cycling stability. The modified electrodes also exhibit excellent disinfection performance and heavy metal adsorption performance. The bacterial elimination rate of co-deposited electrodes grew along with the increase in the PHMG content. Particularly, AC-PDA/PHMG(2) electrodes successfully removed and deactivated 99.11% Escherichia coli and 98.67% Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10(4) CFU mL(-1)) in water within 60 min. Furthermore, three flow cells made by AC-PDA/PHMG(2) electrodes connected in series achieved efficient removal of salt, heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, and bacteria simultaneously, which indicated that the adsorption performance is significantly improved compared with pristine AC electrodes. These results denote the enormous potential of this one-step prepared multi-functional electrodes for facile and effective water purification using CDI technology.

Effects of heat treatment on interfacial characteristics and mechanical properties of titanium matrix composites reinforced with discontinuous carbon fibers	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Composite materials; Powder metallurgy; Sintering; Mechanical properties; TEM	MICROSTRUCTURE; BEHAVIOR	Weak interfacial bonding was a significant problem in titanium matrix composites (TMCs) reinforced with carbon fibers (CFs). In this study, heat treatment (HT) up to 1000 degrees C was applied on powder metallurgy Ti-6Al-4V matrix composites reinforced with discontinuous CFs to obtain different interfacial structures. Mechanical tests at both room-temperature and 500 degrees C showed that the best mechanical properties were attained at HT temperature of 900 degrees C. To understand the underlying mechanism, the phase structure, grain morphology and interfacial microstructure were examined. It was found that as HT temperature was in-creased, the interface thickness increases continuously and obvious grain growth happens at 1000 degrees C. Suitable interfacial reaction and fine grain size are identified as critical structural parameters to obtain high -performance CFs/TMCs. This study may provide new insight into the role of interfacial structure played in the strengthening effect of CFs/TMCs. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Lv, S.; Li, J.

However, leaching of metal ions is a drawback for currently used metal-based catalysts, which limits their applications for water treatment. Therefore, it is important to develop high-efficient non-metal catalysts for photothermal-assisted PMS activation. Carbon nitride(CN) loaded with FeOx nanoparticles (FeOx/CN) were synthesized by the gelation-pyrolysis method. The as-prepared FeOx/CN catalysts were used to eliminate Rhodamine B (RhB) using the Fenton-like reaction by photothermal-assisted PMS activation. The crystalline structures, morphologies and light adsorption properties of the obtained nanocomposites were analyzed by using X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption and UV-vis spectrophotometer. The results show that the removal rate of RhB by CN/FeOx/PMS system can reach 98.0% under the condition of near neutral (pH = 6) and photothermal(40 degrees C water bath and lambda > 420 nm visible-light irradiation) synergistic auxiliary reaction for 30 min. The trapping experiments demonstrate that holes (h) and hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) are major active species during the PMS activation process.

Based on the functional sharing concept, we fabricated mixed electrolytes consisting of solvate ionic liquids (SIL), which are highly concentrated solution electrolyte, and the non-coordinating low-viscosity dilution solvent 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (HFE). We investigated the thermal, transport, and static properties of electrolytes with different ratios of SIL to HFE. In particular, the interactions between the SILs and HFE and static correlations of the coordinating (ether-based molecules), non-coordinating (HFE), and carrier ionic species (lithium salt) were clarified by applying the excess density concept. Ether molecules always formed strong complexes with lithium cations regardless of the absence or presence of HFE. The repulsion force between the SILs and HFE was strongly affected by lithium salt concentration. From our results, we proposed dissociation/association models for these electrolyte systems.

However, the irreversible structural changes and mechanical degradation of PANI during the redox processes result in rapid capacitance decay. To overcome this drawback of PANI, a vulcanized PANI polymer backbone (S-PANI) is fabricated through a vulcanization process in this paper. For the obtained S-PANI, PANI chains are interconnected by the sulfide and/or disulfide bonds, and form a stable, cross-linked porous structure. The special cross-linked structure can effectively accommodate the volumetric expansion and shrinkage of PANI during the charge and discharge process. Consequently, the S-PANI sample shows excellent electrochemical cycle stability with capacitance retention of approximately 96% after 5000 cycles, which is much higher than that of PANI (51%). Moreover, in a symmetric two-electrode full cell system, the S-PANI electrode still possesses a high capacitance retention ratio of approximately 96% even after 10,000 cycles at 3 A g(-1) Thus, S-PANI is a very attractive material for highly stable supercapacitor application.

Interaction between the Black Carbon Aerosol Warming Effect and East Asian Monsoon Using RegCM4	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Climate models; Numerical analysis; modeling; Aerosol optical properties; Aerosol radiative effect	SUMMER MONSOON; REGIONAL CLIMATE; ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS; WINTER MONSOON; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; MODEL; IMPACT; EMISSIONS; CHINA; SIMULATION	Black carbon aerosol (BC) has a significant influence on regional climate changes because of its warming effect. Such changes will feed back to BC loadings. Here, the interactions between the BC warming effect and the East Asian monsoon (EAM) in both winter (EAWM) and summer (EASM) are investigated using a regional climate model, RegCM4, that essentially captures the EAM features and the BC variations in China. The seasonal mean BC optical depth is 0.021 over East Asia during winter, which is 10.5% higher than that during summer. Nevertheless, the BC direct radiative forcing is 32% stronger during summer (+1.85 W m(-2)). The BC direct effect would induce lower air to warm by 0.11-0.12 K, which causes a meridional circulation anomaly associated with a cyclone at 20 degrees-30 degrees N and southerly anomalies at 850 hPa over East Asia. Consequently, the EAM circulation is weakened during winter but enhanced during summer. Precipitation is likely increased, especially in southern China during summer (by 3.73%). Relative to BC changes that result from EAM interannual variations, BC changes from its warming effect are as important but are weaker. BC surface concentrations are decreased by 1%-3% during both winter and summer, whereas the columnar BC is increased in south China during winter. During the strongest monsoon years, the BC loadings are higher at lower latitudes than those during the weakest years, resulting in more southerly meridional circulation anomalies and BC feedbacks during both winter and summer. However, the interactions between the BC warming effect and EAWM/EASM are more intense during the weakest monsoon years.	[Zhuang, B. L.; Li, S.; Wang, T. J.; Liu, J.; Chen, H. M.; Chen, P. L.; Li, M.

Higher insufflation pressures using carbon dioxide (CO2) are required, although the ideal starting pressure is unclear. This prospective, randomized, single-blinded, study aims to compare physiologic differences with 2 different CO2 insufflation pressures during posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to a starting insufflation pressure of 20 mm Hg (low pressure) or 25 mm Hg (high pressure). The primary outcome measure was partial pressure of arterial CO2 at 60 minutes. Secondary outcomes included end-tidal CO2, arterial pH, blood pressure, and peak airway pressure. Breaches of protocol to change insufflation pressure were permitted if required and were recorded. Results: A prospective randomized trial including 31 patients (low pressure: n = 16; high pressure: n = 15) was undertaken. At 60 minutes, the high pressure group had greater mean partial pressure of arterial CO2 (64 vs 50 mm Hg, P = .003) and end-tidal CO2 (54 vs 45 mm Hg, P = .008) and a lesser pH (7.21 vs 7.29, P = .0005). There were no significant differences in base excess, peak airway pressure, operative time, or duration of hospital stay. Clinically indicated protocol breaches were more common in the low pressure than the high pressure group (8 vs 3, P = .03). Conclusion: In posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy, greater insufflation pressures are associated with greater partial pressure of arterial CO2 and end-tidal CO2 and lesser pH at 60 minutes, be significant. Commencing with lesser CO2 insufflation pressures decreases intraoperative acidosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of the Size-Dependent Cytotoxicity of DLC (Diamondlike Carbon) Wear Debris in Arthroplasty Applications	ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						DLC wear debris; cytotoxicity; size; macrophages; osteoblasts; fibroblasts	TOTAL HIP-ARTHROPLASTY; IN-VITRO; PARTICLE-SIZE; MACROPHAGE RESPONSES; COCRMO-ALLOY; CELLS; VIVO; COBALT; POLYETHYLENE; NANOPARTICLES	Patients with DLC (diamond like carbon)-coated artificial joints may be exposed to a wide size range of DLC wear debris (DW). In this study, the cytotoxicity of DW of different size ranges (0-0.22, 0.22-0.65, 0.65-1.0, and 1.0-5.0 mu m) was evaluated. The microstructure and physical characteristics of DW were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Macrophages, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts were incubated with DW of different size ranges respectively followed by cytotoxicity evaluations of inflammatory cytokines, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assays, and related signal protein expression analysis. The results showed that, except for the size range of 0-0.22 mu m, DW cytotoxicity showed a size-dependent (0.22-5.0 mu m) decrease with increasing size. Within the range of 0.22-5.0 mu m, inflammatory response and enhanced osteoblastogenesis and fibrogenesis, with increased viability of cells (macrophages, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts), better morphology, less release of pro-inflammatory factors and more release of anti-inflammatory factors. The results demonstrated that DW sizes below 0.22 mu m had less negative effects on cell adhesion and growth because of the BSA (bovine serum albumin) encapsulation effect. These findings provide valuable knowledge about the comprehensive mechanism of promotion of inflammatory response and inhibition of osteoblastogenesis and fibrogenesis induced by DW. In conclusion, an effective system of biocompatibility evaluation for different sizes of DW was derived.	[Liao, T. T.; Deng, Q. Y.; Li, S. S.; Li, X.; Ji, L.; Wang, Q.; Leng, Y.

As with other battery systems such as the Li-ion, Li-O-2, and Li-S battery systems, understanding the reaction pathway is the first step to achieving high battery performance because the performance is strongly affected by reaction intermediates. Despite intensive efforts in this area, the effect of material parameters (e.g., the electrolyte, the cathode, and the catalyst) on the reaction pathway in Li-CO2 batteries is not yet fully understood. Here, we show for the first time that the discharge reaction pathway of a Li-CO2 battery composed of graphene nanoplatelets/beta phase of molybdenum carbide (GNPs/beta-Mo2C) is strongly influenced by the dielectric constant of its electrolyte. Calculations using the continuum solvents model show that the energy of adsorption of oxalate (C2O42-) onto Mo2C under the low-dielectric electrolyte tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether is lower than that under the high-dielectric electrolyte N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), indicating that the electrolyte plays a critical role in determining the reaction pathway. The experimental results show that under the high-dielectric DMA electrolyte, the formation of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) as a discharge product is favorable because of the instability of the oxalate species, confirming that the dielectric properties of the electrolyte play an important role in the formation of the discharge product. The resulting Li-CO2 battery exhibits improved battery performance, including a reduced overpotential and a remarkable discharge capacity as high as 14,000 mA h g(-1) because of its lower internal resistance. We believe that this work provides insights for the design of Li-CO2 batteries with enhanced performance for practical Li-air battery applications.

This mini-review focuses on the recent progress on development of red phosphorus anode materials for highly-efficient potassium ion storage. The review is started with a short introduction to expound why red phosphorus is a valuable and promising anode material for KIBs. After that, the synthetic methods of red phosphorus anode materials are briefly summarized, including ball-milling, evaporation-deposition, and others. Then, the electrochemical mechanism of red phosphorus anodes for potassium ion storage is summarized and discussed. Next, some useful improvement strategies are put forward to address the challenges facing red phosphorus anodes, encompassing carbon hybridization, nanostructure engineering, defect engineering, chalcogenide modification, construction of passivation layers, electrolyte optimization, and phosphide alloying. Finally, we present a brief summary and some perspectives for further development of red phosphorus materials.

Anatase or Al2O3 can be used as an additive to suppress the "shuttle effect". First-principles approach coupled with van der Waals (vdW) interaction is used to calculate the adsorption energies of Li2Sx (x = 4, 6, 8) molecules on an anatase (1 0 1) or an alpha-Al2O3 (0 0 0 1) surface. The results show that the adsorption of the molecules on an alpha-Al2O3 (0 0 0 1) is stronger than that on an anatase (1 0 1) surface. Furthermore, owing to the existence of an electric field inside the battery during the charge-discharge process, the external electric field effects on the adsorption are investigated. As a result, the adsorption energy (absolute value) almost linearly increases with the increase of electric field intensity in the range from -0. 16 to 0.16 V/A. In addition, the responses of different Li2Sx molecules on an anatase (1 0 1) surface or an alpha-Al2O3 (0 0 0 1) surface to the external electric fields are different.

However, its diagnosis is frequently ineffective because bacterial culture and serology test are usually positive 1-2 weeks or more after the disease onset. To achieve a better detection efficiency, the single-walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) were coupled with the colloidal gold-monoclonal antibody immunochromatographic strips(CGIC). Interestingly, the SWCNT/CGIC assay allowed MP identification, with a detection limit of 1 x 10(2) copies/ml. Using referenced throat swabs of 97 MP and 40 non-MP cases, the assay yielded 72.2% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, 100.0% positive predictive value (PPV), 59.7% negative predictive value (NPV).

Ion-solvent complexes can even promote the decomposition of electrolytes on metal anodes. Herein, first-principles calculations were performed to investigate the origin of the reduced reductive stability of ion-solvent complexes. Both ester and ether electrolyte solvents are selected to interact with Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. The LUMO energy levels of ion-ester complexes exhibit a linear relationship with the binding energy, regulated by the ratio of carbon atomic orbital in the LUMO, while LUMOs of ion-ether complexes are composed by the metal atomic orbitals. This work shows why ion-solvent complexes can reduce the reductive stability of electrolytes, reveals different mechanisms for ester and ether electrolytes, and provides a theoretical understanding of the electrolyte-anode interfacial reactions and guidance to electrolyte and metal anode design.

The surface morphology and optical properties of the synthesized NCDs were characterized. Without further chemical modification, the NCDs emit bright blue fluorescence with a high quantum yield of 56% due to the enhancement effect of N dopant atoms on a surface of carbon quantum dots. Owing to the strong blue fluorescence, negligible toxicity and the special response of heavy metal ions, the NCDs have been used as a fluorescence probe for sensitive and selective detection of Hg2+ and Ag+ ions with detection limit of 4.8 nM and 1 nM, respectively. Moreover, it was successfully applied to determination of Hg2+ and Ag+ in real environmental water samples, which offers the advantages of simplicity and cost efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A series distinct and excellent properties bestow graphdiyne excellent performance in many fields. Here, an innovative progress for preparing graphdiyne by using Cu+ contained material as catalyst is reported and the composite CuI-GD is coupled with flower-like NiAl-LDH to produce H-2 from photocatalytic water splitting. The results of FTIR and Raman spectroscopy together reveal that graphdiyne nanosheets are synthesized successfully by employing a cross-coupling method. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance shows that the hydrogen production activity of CuI-GD/NiAl-LDH has a 15- and 216-fold enhancement compared with CuI-GD and NiAl-LDH, respectively. A series of characterizations are carried out to expound the underlying reasons in the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CuI-GD/NiAl-LDH. Meanwhile, a possible mechanism for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process was proposed to understand the interaction among these materials.

Here, we show an innovative carbiding strategy for sustainable management of radioactive graphite through digestion of carbon in H2O2. The combined action of intermolecular oxidation of graphite by MoO3 and molybdenum carbiding demonstrates success in gasifying graphite and sequestrating uranium for a simulated uranium-contaminated graphite waste. The carbiding process plays a triple role: (1) converting graphite into atomic carbon digestible in H2O2, (2) generating oxalic ligands in the presence of H2O2 to favor U-precipitation, and (3) delivering oxalic ligands to coordinate to Mo-VI-oxo anionic species to improve sample batching capacity. We demonstrate > 99% of uranium to be sequestrated for the simulated waste with graphite matrix completely gasifying while no detectable U-migration occurred during operation. This method has further been extended to removal of surface carbon layers for graphite monolith and thus can be used to decontaminate monolithic graphite waste with emission of a minimal amount of secondary waste. We believe this work not only provides a sustainable approach to tackle the managing issue of heavily metal contaminated graphite waste, but also indicates a promising methodology toward surface decontamination for irradiated graphite in general.

The embedded MWCNTs-COOK (150 ppm) tightened the network-crosslink structure of the selective layer and contributed to a dense hydrophilic membrane surface with high positive chargeability. In addition, MWCNTs-COOK nano-additives in membrane created some intrinsic fast transport channels for water molecules. The MWCNTs-COOK(150 ppm)-assisted NF membrane exhibited a remarkable high flux of 12.23 L/m(2)hbar, a high separation factor S-Li,S-Mg of 58, and a high difference in Li+ and Mg2+ rejections around 77%, indicating an excellent Li+ enrichment and Mg2+ removal capabilities, and breaking through the trad-off limit of permeate flux. Simultaneously, the comprehensive performance of the NF membrane can be maintained stably even in long-term utilization. This work opens a simple and effective pathway for accelerating Li+ enrichment and Mg2+ removal, which has great potential for lithium extraction application.

However, the unavoidable problems associated with them are their intrinsic instability and the trend of the agglomeration. Mesoporous carbon is considered as an ideal matrix for the protection of magnetic nanoparticles owing to its high surface area, excellent chemical and thermal stability. The preparation of morphology defined composites of magnetic nanoparticles and mesoporous carbon is of great importance for their practical applications. In this work, magnetic mesoporous graphitic composites (MMGCs) with defined rhombododecahedral morphology are fabricated by the pyrolysis of the composites from the hierarchical co-assembly of amphiphilic triblock copolymer, resol oligomers and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. MMGCs exhibit narrow bimodal pore size distribution, high surface area and highly stable magnetic properties, which provide them excellent adsorption ability for the removal of organic contaminants in aqueous solution.

The pore structure of the MC material was evaluated using XRD, nitrogen adsorption, TEM and SEM. Electrochemical characterization indicated that the potential shifts toward negative direction. This can be attributed to the porous feature of MC, which imposes resistance for ion migration in mesopores. There was no change in the voltammetric behavior even after the application of successive cycles for PANI-MC electrode, which indicated that PANI-MC electrode exhibited a better physical stability. Finally, anodic stripping voltammetry analysis utilizing the PANI-MC electrode for the determination of the Cu2+ and Pb2+ dissolved in aqueous solution had been demonstrated. The result showed a good linearity between current and concentration from 1.00 x 10(-8) to 1.00 x 10(-6) M for Cu2+ with a detection limit of 6.00 x 10(-9) M, and to that of Pb2+ from 2.00 x 10(-8) to 1.00 x 10(-6) M with a detection limit of 4.00 x 10(-9) M.

However, electrocatalysts grown on conductive substrates usually suffer from disorder and are densely packed with "prohibited zones", in which internal blockages shut off the active sites from catalyzing the oxygen reaction. Herein, to minimize the "prohibited zones", an ordered multidimensional array assembled by 1D carbon nanotubes and 2D carbon nanoridges decorated with 0D cobalt nanoparticles (referred as MPZ-CC@CNT) is constructed on nickel foam. When the MPZ-CC@CNT is directly applied as a self-supported electrode for FZAB, it delivers a marginal voltage fading rate of 0.006 mV cycle(-1) over 1800 cycles (600 h) at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and an impressive energy density of 946 Wh kg(-1). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that minimal internal resistance and electrochemical polarization, which is beneficial for the flash reactant shuttling among the triphase (i.e., oxygen, electrolyte, and catalyst) are offered by the open and ordered architecture. This advanced electrode design provides great potential to boost the electrochemical performance of other rechargeable battery systems.

The electrocatalytic activity of M-N-C materials toward four-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to H2O is a mainstream line of research for replacing platinum-group-metal-based catalysts at the cathode of fuel cells. However, fundamental and practical aspects of their electrocatalytic activity toward two-electron ORR to H2O2, a future green "dream" process for chemical industry, remain poorly understood. Here we combined computational and experimental efforts to uncover the trends in electrochemical H2O2 production over a series of M-N-C materials (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) exclusively comprising atomically dispersed M-N x sites from molecular first-principles to bench-scale electrolyzers operating at industrial current density. We investigated the effect of the nature of a 3d metal within a series of M-N-C catalysts on the electrocatalytic activity/selectivity for ORR (H2O2 and H2O products) and H2O2 reduction reaction (H2O2 RR). Co-N-C catalyst was uncovered with outstanding H2O2 productivity considering its high ORR. activity, highest H2O2 selectivity, and lowest H2O2 RR activity. The activity-selectivity trend over M-N-C materials was further analyzed by density functional theory, providing molecular-scale understandings of experimental volcano trends for four- and two-electron ORR. The predicted binding energy of HO* intermediate over Co-N-C catalyst is located near the top of the volcano accounting for favorable two-electron ORR The industrial H2O2 productivity over Co-N-C catalyst was demonstrated in a microflow cell, exhibiting an unprecedented production rate of more than 4 mol peroxide g(catalyst)(-1) h(-1) at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2).

This unique 3D hierarchical structure and the strong interfacial coupling between the NiFe-LDH and Co@NC-CNTs facilitate the transport of oxygen species as well as electrons and achieve synergy between the integrated nano-scaled structures with different functional components. As expected, a large peak power density of 194 mW cm-2 and outstanding durability for 760 h are obtained in the as-assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery. The resultant water splitting device acquires a cell voltage of 1.66 V at 10 mA cm-2 and the as-assembled Zn-air battery has been successfully employed in a selfpower water splitting system, demonstrating a great potential prospect for practical renewable energy applications.

Investigation of the Effects of Copper Nanoparticles on Magnesium-Sulfur Battery Performance: How Practical Is Metallic Copper Addition?

Other works have reported that use of Cu current collectors at the cathode improves cyclability. Here, we investigate Cu nanoparticles grown on carbon nanofibers (Cu@CNF) as an additive for the Mg/S battery cathode to test the effects of Cu metal on capacity and rate performance at controlled Cu loading. The Mg/S battery with Cu additives can operate at 1 C with a capacity of 452 mAh/g after 100 cycles. It was confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that Cu2S forms during cathode formation and contributes to the high initial capacity, but then converts back to metallic Cu. Upon extending cycling, the Cu additives promote the formation of smaller, more dispersed discharge product particles, thereby enhancing reversibility. Finally, it is found that the loading of S and Cu at the cathode must be low to achieve substantial and sustained benefits of the Cu additives.

Prior work on the deposition of carbon shells around Li2S particles showed reduced dissolution of polysulfides and improved cathode stability. However, due to the substantial volume changes during cycling and the low chemical binding energy between carbon and sulfides, defects almost inevitably forming in the carbon shell during battery operation commonly lead to premature cell failure. In this study, we show that conformal coatings of layered LiTiO2 may offer better protection against polysulfide dissolution and the shuttle effects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that LiTiO2 exhibits a strong affinity for sulfur species (Li2Sx) and, most importantly, induces a rapid conversion of longer (highly soluble) polysulfides to short polysulfides, which exhibit minimum solubility in electrolytes. Quite remarkably, even the mere presence of the electronically conductive layered oxides (LiMO2, M = metal) such as LiTiO2 in the cathodes (e.g., as a component of the mix with Li2S) enhanced the cell rate and cycling stability dramatically. Advanced material characterization in combination with quantum chemistry calculations provided unique insights into the mechanisms of the incredible performance boost, such as interactions between Li2Sx and the LiTiO2 surface, leading to breakage of S-S bonds.

It has been shown that the models composed of the bare graphite and silicate grains together with the multilayer grains containing silicates, organic refractory and water ice, are more useful in explaining extinction under the reduced cosmic abundances, The models based on Mathis' composite grains or on Greenberg & Li's core-mantle grains can also provide quite good fits of the extinction and the measured scattering parameters, but still require an excessive amount of carbon which results in too large a C/O ratio. The inhomogeneous grains essentially contribute to the extinction in practically the whole wavelength range of our extinction curves. As a rule, such grains have quite wide size distributions, centred at around 100 nm. although graphite grains are mainly of small sizes.

Activating Trace Fe Impurity as Catalyst to Plant Carbon Nanotubes Within Ti-6Al-4V Powders for High-Performance Ti Metal Matrix Composites	METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MICROSTRUCTURE	External catalysts are commonly pre-coated on Ti alloy powders for in situ synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to resolve the inhomogeneity issue, but their excessive introduction changes the matrix composition. Here, we activated the catalytic function of trace Fe impurity solid solute in Ti-6Al-4V powders to plant CNTs within the Ti-6Al-4V powders without modifying the composition. These CNTs exhibited high reactivity with Ti, were retained in the consolidated composites, and improved the mechanical properties.	[Li, S. F.; Yang, Y.

And their characterizations were basically conducted via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The XRD results indicated that metallic Pd as the main component was prepared in catalyst a and b. The particle size for catalyst a, b and c was approximately estimated to be 15nm, 10nm and 20 nm, respectively, basing on the TEM images. And the electrocatalytic activities of the obtained catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) were investigated mainly through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). And the results effectively illustrated that catalyst a showed the best electrocatalytic activity toward MOR among all the prepared catalysts. Showing the fact, that the pyrolysis products of the mixture having PdO and PdCl2 and MWCNTs had an unexpected electrocatalytic activity towards MOR, is the main contribution of this work, which can greatly reduce the preparation cost of Pd-based catalyst.

However, RT-Na-S battery technology is facing severe challenges such as dissolution of sodium polysulfide, loss of active material on the surface of anode, serious shuttle effect and poor cycle stability. Herein, we synthesis hollow polar iron nitride nanoparticle encased N-doped carbon yolk shell (YS-Fe2N@NC) as sulfur carrier. The synergistic effect of YS-Fe2N@NC as well as wide void can be effectively trap polysulfides and improve the conductivity of sulfur-based cathode. The reversible reaction mechanism of Na-S battery is studied by in/ex-situ characterizations, catalytic behaviour of YS-Fe2N@NC and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The as made S/YS-Fe2N@NC composite exhibit promising specific capacity of 1123 mAh g(-1) at the rate of 1C for the initial cycle, good rate capability (845 mAh g(-1) at 2C) and ultra-stable cycling performance with an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.0724% per cycle. The present work highlights the importance of introducing the Fe2N to catalyse the conversion reactions of polysulfide within NC shell for boosting the RT-Na-S battery in term of high storage capacity, rate capability and stability.

We established a biosensor by immobilizing acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with the modification of reduced graphene oxide-tetraethylenepentamine (rGO-TEPA) and the copper nanowires (Cu NWs). The rGO-TEPA-Cu NWs was used to improve the electrode conductivity and enhance the electrode loading ability for AChE. Chitosan (CS) was used to as the supporter for AChE. Exposure to malathion inhibited AChE activity and decreased the current significantly. We optimized the detection condition and found that AChE-CS/rGO-TEPA-Cu NWs/GCE showed a linear association with malathion from 1 ng/mL to 20 mu g/mL (R-2 =0.989) and the detection limit was 0.39 ng/mL. Furthermore, analysis of real samples using the biosensor showed satisfactory results. In conclusion, the biosensor we developed in this study has potential application to the detection of organophosphate insecticides such as malathion.

Here, we report a new and facile strategy for controllable synthesis of high-valence Mo modified FeNiV oxides as efficient OER catalysts. The Mo-dopant displays a significant influence on the valence state of Fe species in the catalysts, which lead to tunable OER performance. When the feed ratio of Mo-dopant is 5%, the Mo-modified FeNiV oxide shows the best OER performance in terms of low overpotential (237 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), Tafel slope (38 mV per decade), and high mass activity, which exceeds its counterparts and most reported OER catalysts. Furthermore, by assembling the catalyst with a carbon fiber cloth, the fabricated water-splitting device exhibits excellent activity and long-term durability in alkaline electrolyte compared with commercial catalysts equipped device. This work not only provides a series of Mo-modified FeNiV-based oxides as high-performance OER catalysts but also offers a new pathway to tune the charge states of OER active centers.

However, large-scale synthesis of metal sulfide-amine hybrid nanomaterials is limited by hydrothermal and solvothermal preparative reaction conditions; consequently, incorporation of such materials into functional nanomaterials is hindered. An amine molecule-assisted refluxing method was used to synthesize highly uniform zinc sulfide(diethylenetriamine)(0.5) (ZnS(DETA)(0.5)) hybrid nanosheets and nanobelts in a large scale. The obtained ZnS(DETA)(0.5) hybrid nanomaterials can be used as efficient precursors to fabricate functional ZnS nanomaterials and carbon encapsulated sulfur (S@C) nanocomposite cathodes for Li-S batteries.

Polypyrrole (PPy)-carbon nanotube (CNT) composites with varied ratios of PPy to CNTs were chemically synthesized and used as cathodes with the support of cellulose paper. Zinc foil was used as the anode material due to its non-toxicity and moderate dissolution rate in aqueous solutions. Simulated body fluids (SBFs) with various protein concentrations were applied as electrolytes in this battery system. The PPy-CNT vertical bar Zn cell is capable of being discharged up to 24.5 hours at a current density of 60 mu A cm(-2) in a protein free SBF. The batteries have also been tested in vitro using SBFs containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) with different concentrations. Such a battery can be charged up to 35.1 hours (1.26 W h) in the electrolyte containing 8 g L-1 BSA, which is 10% of the genuine protein concentration of blood plasma. The effects of adding BSA to the electrolyte on both the anodic reactions and the redox capabilities of the PPy-CNT cathodes are also investigated.

With strong wind, surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) increased sharply from 369 to 606 mu atm due to entrainment of high-CO2 subsurface water. Though it was followed by pCO(2) decrease of 250 mu atm and Chl a increase days after the typhoon, the typhoon caused a net CO2 efflux overall. The maximum CO2 efflux (+111.6 mmol.m(-2).day(-1)) is much greater than that under non-typhoon condition (-2.3 to -11.7 mmol.m(-2).day(-1)). Based on historical typhoon records, we estimate typhoon-induced CO2 efflux to be +0.27 Tg C/year, which can cancel 18% of summer CO2 influx in the East China Sea shelf. It may likely occur in other coastal waters. Ignoring such contribution may induce large bias in estimating regional air-sea CO2 flux.

However, comprehensive understanding of the effect of ginsenosides on soil microbiota is still lacking. Methods The ginsenosides in root exudates ofP. notoginsengwere quantified and exogenous ginsenosides on soil microbiota were tested using 16S rRNA and ITS gene tag sequencing. Then its underlying mechanism was deciphered through studying effects of ginsenosides on growth of the ginsenoside-modified culturable fungi and bacteria as well as the relationships between these fungi and bacteria. Results Exogenous root exudates and mixtures of Rg(1) + Rb-1 + Rd had similar ability to drive the change of soil microbiota. Further studies demonstrated that Rg(1) + Rb-1 + Rd mixture could enrich or suppress special fungi and bacteria to modify soil community through differential utilization of carbon source during the early stage (30 days), followed by antagonism between ginsenoside-modified fungi and bacteria to determine soil microbial community modification at later stage (60 and 90 days). Conclusions Ginsenosides were the main substances in exogenous root exudates ofP. notoginsengthat drove the change in soil microbiota, mediating the special interaction between the plant and the microbiota.

In this work, a carbon-coated LiFePO4 was synthesized by a thermal decomposition method using Li3PO4, FePO4, Fe powder and ethanol as the raw materials. Experimental results showed that LiFePO4/C particles were evenly distributed with the sizes of 200 nm similar to 1 mu m, the surface of particles was coated by carbon, and the particles were linked together by carbon fibers. The first discharge capacity of sample reached 137 mAh center dot g(-1) and the first columbic efficiency was over 95%. After 50 cycles, the discharge capacity still remained unchanged, which indicated the good cycle capability and reversibility. Our research lowered the cost of Li-ion batteries and provided a feasible application in Li-ion batteries for industrial production.

The XRD, UV-vis, SEM and PL results indicate that the introduction of phosphorus and oxygen enhances the specific surface area of graphitic carbon nitride (from 12.8 to 92.5 m(2) g(-1)), restrains the crystal growth, decreases the band gap energy (from 2.68 to 2.51 eV) and increases the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, which increases the anoxic photocatalytic RhB degradation constants by approximately 27 times under visible light. Oxygen doping not only promotes the adsorption ability of reactant but also captures the photogenerated electrons to produce photogenerated holes for RhB degradation under anoxic condition. This study provides new insight into the design and fabrication of oxygen-free photocatalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impact of drone delivery on sustainability and cost: Realizing the UAV potential through vehicle routing optimization	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Supply chain sustainability; Carbon reduction; Vehicle routing; Unmanned aerial vehicle	UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE; FUEL CONSUMPTION; CO2 EMISSIONS; GREEN; MODEL; FLEET; ALGORITHM; DESIGN; DEPOT	An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, offers the advantage of speed, flexibility, and ease in delivering goods to customers. They are particularly useful for tasks that are dull, hazardous, or dirty. Whether the use of drone delivery is beneficial to the environment and cost saving is still a topic under debate. Ideally, drones yield lower energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing the carbon footprint and enhancing environmental sustainability. In this research, we analytically study the impact of UAVs on CO2 emission and cost. We propose a mixed-integer (0-1 linear) green routing model for UAV to exploit the sustainability aspects of the use of UAVs for last-mile parcel deliveries. A genetic algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the complex model, and an extensive experiment is conducted to illustrate and validate the analytical model and the solution algorithm. We find that optimally routing and delivering packages with UAVs would save energy and reduce carbon emissions. The computational results strongly support the notion that using UAVs for last-mile logistics is not only cost effective, but also environmentally friendly.

Axial and circular CSCPs (ACSCPs and CCSCPs) are simultaneously manufactured by a hot press moulding and post-assembly approach. It has been demonstrated that foam filled CSCPs can obviously improve the structural damping compared to the empty CSCPs without significant change of the corresponding natural frequencies. Furthermore, validated finite element analysis (FEA) models are adopted to systematically study the effects of the corrugated inclination angle, sandwich core thickness, arc-length and topological corrugated configurations on the modal properties.

Dose-dependent cytotoxicity evaluation of graphite nanoparticles for diamond-like carbon film application on artificial joints	BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS			English	Article						graphite nanoparticles; dose; inflammation; osteoblast; cytotocixity	PARTICLE-INDUCED OSTEOLYSIS; IN-VITRO; DLC COATINGS; WEAR; OSTEOBLASTS; PROLIFERATION; STRESS; DEBRIS; SIZE; PROSTHESIS	While a diamond-like carbon (DLC)-coated joint prosthesis represents the implant of choice for total hip replacement in patients, it also leads to concern due to the cytotoxicity of wear debris in the form of graphite nanoparticles (GNs), ultimately limiting its clinical use. In this study, the cytotoxicity of variousGNdoses was evaluated. Mouse macrophages and osteoblasts were incubated with GNs (< 30 nmdiameter), followed by evaluation of cytotoxicity by means of assessing inflammatory cytokines, results of alkaline phosphatase assays, and related signaling protein expression. Cytotoxicity evaluation showed that cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner (10-100 mu g ml(-1)), and steeply declined at GNs concentrations greater than 30 mu g ml(-1). Noticeable cytotoxicity was observed as theGNdose exceeded this threshold due to upregulated receptor of activator of nuclear factor kBligand expression and downregulated osteoprotegerin expression. Meanwhile, activated macrophage morphology was observed as a result of the intense inflammatory response caused by the high doses of GNs (> 30 mu g ml(-1)), as observed by the increased release of TNF-alpha and IL-6. The results suggest that GNs had a significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro, with a lethal dose of 30 mu g ml(-1) leading to dramatic increases in cytotoxicity. OurGNcytotoxicity evaluation indicates a safe level for wear debris-related arthropathy and could propel the clinical application of DLC-coated total hip prostheses.	[Liao, T. T.; Deng, Q. Y.; Wu, B.

The yield and specific rotation of poly(N-vinylcarbazole)s (poly(NVC)s) were considerably affected by the molar ratio of (S)-FIDH to NVC. The highest yield and specific rotation were obtained with Li- (S)-1-FIDH as an initiator, with a molar ratio of monomer and initiator [M]/[I] = 10/1. The effects of the chiral initiators, type of solvent and the polymerization temperature were investigated. The obtained optical activity of polymers was attributed to asymmetric induction of the chiral initiators.

This unique microstructure endows Ni2P@CNT with close interfacial interaction, promotes efficient separation of photoexcited charge carriers and provides enriched sites for photocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the hybrid systemis found to exhibit more superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity than pure CNT and Ptdecorated CNT (Pt@CNT).

X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the amorphous Sb2S3/C composite was composed of amorphous Sb2S3 phases distributed uniformly within an amorphous carbon matrix. The electrochemical reaction mechanism of amorphous Sb2S3/C with Li was examined by extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses. The fabricated amorphous Sb2S3/C composite electrode showed excellent electrochemical properties, such as a high energy density (1st charge: 757 mAh g(-1)), long cyclability (ca. 600 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles), and good initial Coulombic efficiency (ca. 85%). When tested within various voltage windows, the amorphous Sb2S3/C composite electrode was found to be suitable for use as a dual electrodes, such as the anode in Li-ion batteries or the cathode in Li/S batteries.

However, most of these semiconductors have limited charge mobility and poor charge separation. Using a flux-assisted technique, we synthesized high symmetry anisotropic facets (18-facet Sr2CoTaO6) double perovskite oxide semiconductor. Surface doping of sulfur (S) and carbon (C) into the lattice of a particulate novel Sr2CoTaO6 induced microstrain to enhance the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 by boosting charge density to tune chargecarrier mobility. The S and C incorporation boosted the photocatalytic CO2 reduction more than eleven orders of magnitude higher than pristine Sr2CoTaO6 under visible light irradiation. Such efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction is attributed to the synergistic effect of tuning the carriers mobility and spatial charge separation via chemical and electronic engineering of the particulate (S, C)-codoped Sr2CoTaO6. The concept of fabrication of spatial charge separation and engineering electron mobility will explore a new avenue to design an efficient photocatalytic system for the conversion of solar energy to solar fuels.

A detailed understanding of the physical interactions involved in the lightning strike process is still lacking, especially regarding the lightning-induced mechanical effects that potentially contribute to fracture and ply delamination in CFRP structures. This paper presents research on shock wave pressure induced by impulse currents on CFRP laminates. A novel method that exploits a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) piezoelectric sensor was developed to directly measure the pressure induced by arc channel expansion. The influences of discharge polarity, strike distance and surface condition on the shock wave pressure were investigated. The results showed that the shock wave pressure produced by negative discharge was greater than that produced by positive discharge, the difference between which was reasonably explained based on the polarity effect concept. Increases in current amplitude and strike distance both contributed to larger measured pressures. A woven copper mesh protection could diminish the shock wave pressure to some extent, while an additional insulating epoxy resin layer enhanced it. Analysis results demonstrated that the pressure imposed on the laminated samples was related to the energy injected into the arc channel. In addition, the energy consumed by vaporized materials at the interface between the arc root and sample was defined as another source of shock wave pressure. The presence of an insulating layer confined the diffusion of the plasma channel at the arc root, as confirmed by high-speed imaging observations.

REDD+ compliance, depoliticization and Indigenous subjectivities	JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						global environmental governance; REDD+; governmentality; environmentality; capacity-building	CARBON; PLUS; GOVERNMENTALITY; RESILIENCE; GOVERNANCE; RESISTANCE; POLITICS; ECONOMY; SUMMIT	REDD+ regimes are accompanied by capacity-building and educational practices, which play an important role in REDD+ governance. These practices address subaltern local and Indigenous actors, seek their compliance and thereby contribute to the stabilization of otherwise all-too-fragile global carbon governance systems. In this article I analyze the governing effects of such practices by drawing on Robert Fletcher's concept of "multiple environmentalities" and Tania Murray Li's "analytic of assemblage." Empirically I focus on educational materials that have been designed for REDD+ projects in cooperation with one of the world's largest REDD+ funds, Norway's International Climate and Forest Initiative. I identify several strategies that aim at aligning diverse actors, seek to de- or re-politicize REDD+ concepts, authorize knowledge, and, most significantly, address local actors as responsible ecological stewards, who contribute to stabilizing REDD+ regimes on the ground. In total, these strategies promote programmatic subjectivities among Indigenous 'stakeholders' and contribute to a new, 'glocal' understanding of nature-society relations.

However, a plethora of research are focusing on impregnating the tellurium into porous carbon materials by the thermal-diffusion method, which would consume large amounts of energy and take prolonged time. Herein, a carbon and binder-free cathode with 100% Te is fabricated by a facile galvanic replacement method on a nickle foam. Driven by the large electrochemical potential difference between Ni and Te, desirable amounts of Te can be obtained in just 10 min with no need of energy input. Li-Te batteries constructed by the as-obtained cathode show relatively good performance in DMSO solvent. To further elevate the performance of this battery especially at low current density, commercial carbon cloth is added between the separator and Te electrode as an interlayer. The cell with interlayer delivers a gravimetric capacity of 116.2 mAh g(-1) after 70 cycles at the current density of 100 mA g(-1), which is 2.8 times as high as that of a cell without interlayer (40.4 mAh g(-1)).

Lithium oxygen (Li-O-2) batteries could achieve high energy density, but they are still facing problems such as low practical capacity and poor cyclability. Here, we prepare activated carbons (MGACs) based on the natural plant Miscanthus x giganteus (MG) through slow pyrolysis. It possesses a large surface area, plenty of active sites, and high porosity, which are beneficial to the utilization of oxygen electrode in Li-O-2 batteries. The MGACs-based oxygen electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 9400 mAh/g at 0.02 mA/cm(2), and long cycle life of 601 cycles (with a cutoff capacity of 500 mAh/g) and 295 cycles (with a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh/g) at 0.2 mA/cm(2), respectively. Additionally, the material exhibits high rate capability and high reversibility, which is a promising candidate for the application in Li-O-2 batteries.

Samples were extracted from matrices using a magnetic solid-phase extraction method based on Fe3O4 modified carbon nanospheres as adsorbent. Experimental variables were optimized using one-variable-at-a-time and response surface methodology. Six chiral pesticides were simultaneously enantio-separated under one chromatographic condition using Chiralpak IG column, and a reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used for their sensitive and selective quantification. Under the optimum conditions, good linearity was obtained for all enantiomers with correlation coefficients (R-2) greater than 0.9912. The mean recoveries of the analytes were in the range of 84.0-105.2%, with intra- and inter-batch precision less than 10.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Method quantification limits varied from 1 to 4 ng g(-1) in all the tested matrices. The developed method was successfully applied to real samples to monitor the occurrence and enantiomeric composition of chiral pesticides, demonstrating its applicability for the routine analysis of chiral pesticide residues in food samples.

An 8-yr experiment for testing different tillage and straw management practices was conducted in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) rotation system in the southern Loess Plateau of China. Three tillage methods (control with no-tillage and straw removal [CK], no-tillage with straw stubbles 30-40 cm in height [NT], and rotary tillage with straw incorporation [RT]) were applied before maize planting, and two straw treatments (straw return [SR] and no straw return [SR0]) were applied after maize harvest. Over the 8 yr, SOC stocks exhibited similar dynamic changing trends in all treatments but were higher under NT, RT, and SR than under CK-SR0. Compared with the initial soil, SOC stock increased the most (34.1%) in NT-SR. Compared with the CK-SR0, the NT-SR, RT-SR, CK-SR, NT-SR0, and RT-SR0 increased wheat grain yields by 47.2, 36.8, 24.9, 25.1, and 20.0%, respectively. Similar trends were found for maize grain yields. The NT, RT, and SR increased crop yield stability with the highest sustainable yield index in NT-SR for both wheat (.67) and maize (.70). Overall, the combination of no-tillage with wheat straw stubbles 30-40 cm in height and maize straw return was the best strategy for improving SOC stocks, grain yields, and agricultural sustainability for grain production in dry, sub-humid areas of northwestern China.

Nur			Swelling reduction of polyvinylidenefluoride hollow fiber membrane incorporated with silicoaluminophosphate-34 zeotype filler for membrane gas absorption	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Membrane contactor; Carbon dioxide; Inorganic filler; Membrane wetting; Swelling	HYDROPHOBIC SILICA NANOPARTICLES; MIXED MATRIX MEMBRANES; CO2 ABSORPTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; COMPOSITE MEMBRANES; SAPO-34 ZEOLITE; PVDF MEMBRANE; CONTACTOR; SEPARATION; WATER	CO2 gas absorption is important in fuel purification and carbon capture. By incorporating a porous membrane with a large surface area in membrane gas absorption (MGA) system, the CO2 transfer between feed gas and liquid absorbent can be greatly improved. However, the absorption flux usually drops in the long-term operation due to membrane wetting by the common liquid absorbent, amine. Membrane wetting can lead to membrane swelling which induce the growth of mass transfer resistance. In this work, silicoaluminophosphate-34 (SAPO-34) zeolite was incorporated into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane to reduce flux decline caused by membrane swelling. The membrane porosity and pore size increased with increasing SAPO-34 loading. Nevertheless, significant changes in water contact angle or liquid entry pressure were not shown. PVDF hollow fiber membrane incorporated with 3 wt% of SAPO-34 showed slightly higher CO2 absorption flux to PVDF hollow fiber membrane in MGA with distilled water as the absorbent. However, the CO2 absorption flux of this PVDF/SAPO-34 membrane was greatly improved of about 140 % higher than the CO2 absorption flux of the neat membrane when diethanolamine was used as the absorption. The CO2 absorption flux of PVDF hollow fiber membrane dropped about 60 % after 96 hours. Although these membranes showed a similar water contact angle after being wetted by water or amine, they swelled differently. PVDF hollow fiber membrane swelled nearly 71.0 % after being wetted by amine, but only swelled about 2 % after being wetted by water. The incorporation of SAPO-34 into PVDF hollow fiber membrane reduced swelling by amine, down to 47.7 %. The swelling reduction could be a major cause of absorption improvement shown by PVDF/SAPO-34 hollow fiber membrane in MGA using diethanolamine.	[Ahmad, N. A.; Leo, C. P.; Ahmad, A.

In this route, low surface area SiO2 microspheres are obtained from wheat straw ash, with the activated carbon and Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (NPK) compound fertilizer as by-products. KOH is used as the silica extraction reagent and H3PO4 is the precipitator. The resulting SiO2 microspheres with narrow size distribution have an amorphous structure with diameters of approximately 480 nm and a specific surface area of 47.79 m(2) g(-1) under the optimized synthesis conditions with a volume ratio of 1 : 1.5 : 1 for extract/water/ethanol, a pH value of 8 and H3PO4 solution dripping rate of 3 mL min(-1). In this optimized route, the yields of SiO2 and activated carbon reach 96.77% and 71.89%, respectively. The waste water produced in this process is used to produce NPK compound fertilizer. The whole route is an environmentally friendly process without any emission of pollution.

M-Z18 through optimization of the culture medium. Glycerol, (NH4)(2)SO4 and K2HPO4 were the key factors in the fermentation according to the results obtained from the Plackett-Burman experimental design. The optimal concentration of the three factors was further investigated according to the central composite design and determined to be 59.48, 4.43 and -0.49 g/L, respectively. Under optimal conditions, a epsilon-PL concentration of 2.27 +/- 0.15 g/L was obtained. Compared with glucose, fermentation of glycerol afforded 2.8-fold and 6.3-fold the epsilon-PL titer and yield, respectively. Therefore, glycerol may be an efficient carbon source for epsilon-PL production by Streptomyces sp. M-Z18. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this research, long multi-walled carbon nanotubes (long-MWCNTs) and its thin sheet of entangled nanotubes were used to make composites to achieve higher electrical and thermal conductivity. Compared to short-MWCNT sheet/epoxy composites, at room temperature, long-MWCNT samples showed improved thermal conductivity up to 55 W/mK. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity was in agreement with kappa proportional to T-n (n = 1.9-2.3) below 150 K and saturated around room temperature due to Umklapp scattering. Samples with the improved CNT degree of alignment by mechanically stretching can enhance the room temperature thermal conductivity to over 100 W/mK. However, functionalization of CNTs to improve the interfacial bonding resulted in damaging the CNT walls and decreasing the electrical and thermal conductivity of the composites.

However, the real discharge process of SF6 remains ambiguous with fast cathode passivation and large polarization. Here we report that the Li-SF6 chemistry is able to deliver an unprecedented capacity of >20,000 mA h g(c)(-1) with reduced polarization and excellent rate capability by using a low-cost, high-surface-area porous carbon as cathode host. More importantly, by adjusting the SF6 atmosphere, an approximately eight-electron transfer process with predominant products of LiF and Li2S is realized via two voltage steps, whereas previously only a little Li2S could be found with one plateau appearing. The eight-electron process leads to a high energy density about 2,300 W h kg(-1) based on the mass of carbon and discharge products, which sheds light on SF6 as a promising high-energy-density cathode.

Even low energy photolysis (lambda > 500 nm) leads to the formation of quintet (S = 2) and septet (S = 3) radicals which were investigated by isotopic substitutions in both the laser-vaporized graphite and the methane: C-12/(CH4)-C-12, C-12/(CH4)-C-13, C-12/(CD4)-C-12, C-13/(CH4)-C-12, C-13/(CD4)-C-12. Hyperfine splitting patterns and derived zero-field (D) parameters were used in efforts to characterize these two high-spin metastable species. The polycarbon molecules were also trapped in pure solid D2 at 2 K, but less effectively in solid H-2 and HD. The magnetic parameters obtained from the deuterium and the methane studies are compared with those determined earlier in the solid rare gases.

However, the introduction of additional 3D-structured electrode materials on a typical Cu foil substrate decreases the specific/volumetric capacities of LMA. Herein, we report an alternative intagliated Cu foil (I-Cu) substrate with lithiophilic trenches that can be prepared through a mass-scalable photoresist process followed by simple chemical treatments. The patterned trenches are covered with nanocrevices, including numerous oxygen functional groups (O/Cu ratio of 1.00) and nanopores, extensively widening the electrochemical active surface area (EASA) of the I-Cu substrate by > 30 times that of a typical 2D Cu foil. The nanostructure, high surface area, lithiophilic surface properties, and intagliated trenches of the I-Cu substrate serve to guide preferred lithium metal nucleation and growth behavior on the controlled active surfaces. Accordingly, highly efficient and stable cycling performances were accomplished for the LMA composed of the I-Cu substrate over 500 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of similar to 99%. Moreover, the feasibility of the I-Cu-based LMA was demonstrated in the full cell tests with typical cathode materials, NCM622 and a sulfur copolymer.

The effects of sintering temperature on the densification, morphology and mechanical performances of the SiCp-SiCw-graphene ceramics were investigated. In the temperature range from 1700 to 1800 degrees C, the densification rate of SiCp-SiCw-graphene ceramics was accelerated, ascribing to the reduction in viscosity of the glassy phase. M 1800 degrees C, the flexural strength and fracture toughness of the OPS ceramics corresponded to 697 MPa and 5.8 MPa m(1/2), respectively, which were higher than that of the hot-pressed ceramics under the same temperature conditions. Multiphase toughening mechanisms, such as whisker bridging and pullout, graphene bridging and delamination, were considered as the primary mechanisms. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to prepare silicon carbide ceramics at low sintering temperature.

To compare the electrochemical reactions in the electrolytes with different solvents, the ratio of ether oxygen atoms and Lit ([O]/[Li]) in the electrolytes was fixed at four. The capacity of a Li LiCoO2 cell with [Li(THF)(4)][THA] dramatically decreased upon charge/discharge cycling, whereas [Li(G3)(1)] [MA] allowed the cell to have a stable charge discharge cycles and a Coulombic efficiency of greater than 99% over 100 cycles. Corrosion of the Al current collector of the cathode was also affected by the composition of the electrolytes. Persistent Al corrosion took place in [Li(THF)(4)][TFSA] and [Li(G1)(2)][TFSA], which contain shorter ethers, but the corrosion was effectively suppressed in [Li(G3)(1)] [TFSA]. Furthermore, lithium polysulfides, which are formed as discharge intermediates at the sulfur cathode of the Li S cell, were much less soluble in electrolytes with longer ethers. Therefore, a higher Coulombic efficiency and more stable cycle ability were achieved in Li S cells with [Li(G(3))(1)][TESA]. All the electrochemical properties in the batteries were dominated by the presence or absence of uncoordinating solvents in the concentrated electrolytes. This paper demonstrates that the structural stability of [Li(glyme or THF)(x)](+) cations in electrolytes plays an important role in the performance of Li batteries.

In this study, we describe a cell factory of the evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on adaptive laboratory evolution that efficiently biotransforms mannitol into the high value-added sesquiterpenoid valencene. The evolved S. cerevisiae BN-91A with a series of mutations in the genome exhibited superior performance in mannitol assimilation, with the expression levels of genes involved in mannitol assimilation being dramatically upregulated by 50-480 fold. When grown on mannitol, the BN-91A strain showed a valencene titer of 17.2 mg L-1 and a carbon conversion efficiency of 1.905 mg g(-1), which were approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than those on glucose, respectively. Further analysis of the valencene synthase coding gene revealed an elevation of its gene dose and transcriptional level under mannitol conditions, which were 3-fold and 5-fold as much as those under glucose conditions, respectively. Moreover, the valencene titer of BN-91A had little to no impact upon salt shock, indicating the competence of BN-91A to produce valencene from macroalgae-derived mannitol. An improved valencene titer of 161.1 mg L-1 was obtained in flasks after applying a combinational engineering strategy including precursor supply enhancement, mannitol uptake facilitation and cofactor regeneration acceleration. Finally, a maximum valencene titer of 5.61 g L-1 was obtained in a fed-batch bioreactor with mannitol feeding. Our findings establish a novel strategy of terpenoid production in S. cerevisiae, which opens a new avenue for application of third-generation renewable biomass marine macroalgae.

XPS, and cyclic voltammetry techniques were used to characterize the structural changes in these catalysts after heat-treatment, including the total metal loading and the mole ratio of Fe to Co in the catalyst, the possible structures of the surface active sites. and the electrochemical activity XPS analysis revealed that Co-N-x, Fe-N-x, and C-N were present on the catalyst particle surface. To assess catalyst ORR activity, quantitative evaluations using both RDE and RRDE techniques were carried out, and several kinetic parameters were obtained, including overall ORR electron transfer number, electron transfer coefficient in the rate-determining step (RDS), electron transfer rate constant in the RDS, exchange current density, and mole percentage of H2O2 produced in the catalyzed ORR. The overall electron transfer number for the catalyzed ORR was similar to 3.88. with H2O2 production under 10%, suggesting that the ORR catalyzed by FeCo-N/C catalyst is dominated by a 4-electron transfer pathway that produces H2O. The stability of the binary FeCo-N/C catalyst was also tested using single Fe-N/C and Co-N/C catalysts as baselines The experimental results clearly indicated that the binary FeCo-N/C catalyst had enhanced activity and stability towards the ORR Based on the experimental results, a possible mechanism for ORR performance enhancement using a binary FeCo-N/C catalyst is proposed and discussed (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd	[Li, Shang; Zhang, Lei; Kim, Jenny; Shi, Zheng; Zhang, Jiujun] Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Fuel Cell Innovat, Vancouver, BC V6T 1W5, Canada; [Li, Shang; Pan, Mu] Wuhan Univ Technol, State Key Lab Adv Technol Mat Synth & Proc, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China		Zhang, L (corresponding author), Natl Res Council Canada, Inst Fuel Cell Innovat, 4250 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1W5, Canada.

Enhanced electrocatalytic currents and well-separated potentials for EP and UA were observed. The anodic peak currents of EP and UA were linear to the corresponding concentrations in the range of 6.0x10(-6)-1.0x10(-4) mol L-1. In addition, the modified electrode showed good sensitivity and stability. Satisfactory results were achieved for the determination of EP and UA in injection solutions of EP and in human urine samples.

Here, we report a convenient dissolve-regrowth method for synthesizing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a large surface area and nitrogen vacancies by HCl treatment. XRD, N(2)adsorption, SEM, TEM, UV-Vis spectroscopy, EPR, N-2-TPD, Photoluminescence and Photocurrent were used to characterize the prepared catalysts. The results indicate that HCl treatment does not influence the crystal phase of g-C3N4 but change the morphology and optical property, leading to the smaller particle size, larger surface area and increased bang gap energy. It is deduced by N-2-TPD, Photoluminescence, Photocurrent and DFT simulations that the nitrogen vacancies formed by the HCl treatment not only serve as active sites to adsorb and activate N-2 molecules but also promote interfacial charge transfer from g-C(3)N(4)to N-2 molecules. The HCl treated g-C3N4 catalyst exhibits outstanding nitrogen photofixation ability under visible light, which is 13.4-fold higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 without nitrogen vacancy. The possible reaction mechanism is proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the poor electrical conductivity and sluggish electrochemical kinetics of metal sulfides are the critical factors that are limiting their applications. In this work, cobalt sulfides with heterostructures embedded in an N-doped carbon composite (CoS/Co9S8@NC) have been synthesized to further investigate Na+ diffusion in the SIBs. With contributions from the heterostructure, the N-doped carbon, and the unique morphology, the composite can deliver enhanced rate capability and cycling stability compared to Co9S8. This work depicts the change of Na+ diffusion under the influence of heterostructures, providing an effective strategy of material design for enhancing the electrochemical performance of sodium-ion storage.

However, synthesis of functional nanostructures often involves expensive starting materials and elaborate processing, both of which present a challenge for successful implementation in low-cost applications. In seeking a sustainable and cost-effective route to prepare nanostructured battery electrode materials, we are inspired by the diversity of natural materials. Here, we show that crab shells with the unique Bouligand structure consisting of highly mineralizd chitin-protein fibers can be used as biotemplates to fabricate hollow carbon nanofibers; these fibers can then be used to encapsulate sulfur and silicon to form cathodes and anodes for Li-ion batteries. The resulting nanostructured electrodes show high specific capacities (1230 mAh/g for sulfur and 3060 mAh/g for silicon) and excellent cycling performance (up to 200 cycles with 60% and 95% capacity retention, respectively). Since crab shells are readily available due to the 0.5 million tons produced annually as a byproduct of crab consumption, their use as a sustainable and low-cost nanotemplate represents an exciting direction for nanostructured battery materials.

In this study, we generated a novel virus-like particle (VLP) CTGF vaccine by inserting the 138-159 amino acid (aa) fragment of CTGF into the central c/e1 epitope of C-terminus truncated hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBc, aa 1-149) using a prokaryotic expression system. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the VLP vaccine efficiently elicited the production of anti-CTGF neutralizing antibodies. Vaccination with this CTGF vaccine significantly protected BALB/c mice from carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic fibrosis, as indicated by decreased hepatic hydroxyproline content and lower fibrotic score. CCl4 intoxication-induced hepatic stellate cell activation was inhibited by the vaccination, as indicated by decreased alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and Smad2 phosphorylation. Vaccination against CTGF also attenuated the over-expression of some profibrogenic factors, such as CTGF, transforming growth factor-beta 1, platelet-derived growth factor-B and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in the fibrotic mouse livers, decreased hepatocyte apoptosis and accelerated hepatocyte proliferation in the fibrotic mouse livers. Our results clearly indicate that vaccination against CTGF inhibits fibrogenesis, alleviates hepatocyte apoptosis and facilitate hepatic regeneration. We suggest that the vaccine should be developed into an effective therapeutic measure for hepatic fibrosis.

Modelled black carbon radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetime in AeroCom Phase II constrained by aircraft observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							VERTICAL PROFILES; CLIMATE MODELS; AEROSOL DIRECT; EMISSIONS; SENSITIVITY	Atmospheric black carbon (BC) absorbs solar radiation, and exacerbates global warming through exerting positive radiative forcing (RF). However, the contribution of BC to ongoing changes in global climate is under debate. Anthropogenic BC emissions, and the resulting distribution of BC concentration, are highly uncertain. In particular, long-range transport and processes affecting BC atmospheric lifetime are poorly understood. Here we discuss whether recent assessments may have overestimated present-day BC radiative forcing in remote regions. We compare vertical profiles of BC concentration from four recent aircraft measurement campaigns to simulations by 13 aerosol models participating in the AeroCom Phase II intercomparison. An atmospheric lifetime of BC of less than 5 days is shown to be essential for reproducing observations in remote ocean regions, in line with other recent studies. Adjusting model results to measurements in remote regions, and at high altitudes, leads to a 25% reduction in AeroCom Phase II median direct BC forcing, from fossil fuel and biofuel burning, over the industrial era. The sensitivity of modelled forcing to BC vertical profile and lifetime highlights an urgent need for further flight campaigns, close to sources and in remote regions, to provide improved quantification of BC effects for use in climate policy.

The combination structures demonstrate unique properties that individual layers do not possess, which foretell promising future applications. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of SiC/graphene, SiC/MoS2, and graphene/SiC/MoS2 vdW heterostructures using first-principles calculations. The SiC/graphene interface forms a p-type Schottky contact, which can be turned into an n-type Schottky contact by applying an external electric field. Moreover, a transition from a Schottky to an Ohmic contact at the interface can be triggered by varying the interlayer distance or applying an external electric field. The SiC/MoS2 interface forms a type-II heterostructure, in which the recombination of photoexcited charges will be greatly suppressed. The transition from type-II to type-III band alignment can be realized in the SiC/MoS2 heterostructure by applying a biaxial strain. This heterostructure also shows excellent optical absorption abilities in the visible and far-infrared range, which merits its application as a photocatalyst. The trilayer heterostructure exhibits a tunable Schottky barrier with different stacking patterns and the assembled graphene could act as a protective encapsulating layer on SiC/MoS2. The results show that graphene and MoS2 can tune and improve the electronic performance of SiC and demonstrate the promising application of SiC-based heterostructures for nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

The influences of several variables associated with air staging on NOx reduction efficiency and unburned carbon in fly ash were investigated, and these variables included the air stoichiometric ratio of primary combustion zone (SR1), the locations of over-fire air nozzles along furnace height, and the ratio of coal concentration of the fuel-rich stream to that of the fuel-lean one (RRL) in primary air nozzle. The experimental results indicate that SR1 and RRL have optimum values for NOx reduction, and the two optimum values are 0.85 and 3:1, respectively. NO, reduction efficiency monotonically increases with the increase of OFA nozzle location along furnace height. On the optimized operating conditions of air staging, NOx reduction efficiency can attain 47%. Although air staging can effectively reduce NOx emission, the increase of unburned carbon in fly ash should be noticed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, a salt-template method to fabricate densely populated, monodispersed cobalt atoms on a nitrogen-doped graphene-like carbon support is reported, and achieving a dramatically higher site fraction of Co atoms (approximate to 15.3%) in the catalyst and demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic activity for both the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The atomic dispersion and high site fraction of Co provide a large electrochemically active surface area of approximate to 105.6 m(2) g(-1), leading to very high mass activity for ORR (approximate to 12.164 A mg(Co)(-1) at 0.8 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), almost 10.5 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art benchmark Pt/C catalyst (1.156 A mg(Pt)(-1) under similar conditions). It also demonstrates an outstanding mass activity for OER (0.278 A mg(Co)(-1)). The Zn-air battery based on this bifunctional catalyst exhibits high energy density of 945 Wh kg(Zn)(-1) as well as remarkable stability. In addition, both density functional theory based simulations and experimental measurements suggest that the Co-N-4 sites on the carbon matrix are the most active sites for the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity.

However, despite the relevant capacity contents reported in the literature, Se-based cathodes generally show poor rate capability behavior. To circumvent this issue, we propose a series of selenium@carbon (Se@C) composite positive electrode active materials capable of delivering a four-electron redox reaction when placed in contact with an aqueous copper-ion electrolyte solution (i.e., 0.5 M CuSO4) and copper or zinc foils as negative electrodes. The lab-scale Zn | |Se@C cell delivers a discharge voltage of about 1.2 V at 0.5 A g(-1) and an initial discharge capacity of 1263 mAh g(Se)(-1). Interestingly, when a specific charging current of 6 A g(-1) is applied, the Zn | |Se@C cell delivers a stable discharge capacity of around 900 mAh g(Se)(-1) independently from the discharge rate. Via physicochemical characterizations and first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that battery performance is strongly associated with the reversible structural changes occurring at the Se-based cathode. Aqueous battery Se-based cathodes are based on a two-electron transfer electrochemical reaction and generally show inadequate rate capability behaviour. Here, the authors propose a four-electron Se chemistry with copper ions as charge carriers to enable fast-charging battery cycling.

One of the most critical problems is the uneven Li deposition on top of the CC due to the lithiophobic and electron-conducting nature, which induces the uncontrollable Li dendrite growth leading to short circuit and other safety issues. Here, we report a mixed ion/electron-conducting scaffold (MIECS) as a flexible Li metal anode host, synthesized through the in situ conversion of Cu2S into the high Li-ion-conductive Li2S layer on the CC skeleton. Together with high lithiophilicity, the MIECS can achieve homogeneous Li-ion flux, which realizes uniform Li nucleation and growth in the whole structure via balanced ion/electron transport. Thus, the MIECS displays enhanced electrochemical performances with ultrahigh coulombic efficiency, long cyclic life, good rate performance, and high flexibility. Furthermore, the full battery coupled with organic cathode shows excellent flexibility and superior cyclic stability even after bending 1000 cycles. This work provides insight into the promising potential of 3D MIECS for flexible Li metal anodes.

J	Li, FP; Yang, ZM; Zheng, AH; Li, S				Li, Faping; Yang, Zheming; Zheng, Aohan; Li, Shan			Properties of modified engineered geopolymer composites incorporating multi-walled carbon Nanotubes(MWCNTs) and granulated blast furnace Slag(GBFS)	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Geopolymer; Stain hardening; PVA fiber; Tensile capacity		Engineered cementitious composites (ECC) are widely used owing to their high tensile capacity and strainhardening behavior; however, the use of large quantities of cement require huge amount of resources and pollutes the environment. Fly ash-based geopolymer has been considered as a promising alternative for the development of high-ductility eco-friendly engineered materials. To improve the tensile capacity of engineered geopolymer composites (EGC), an ultra-high-ductility engineered geopolymer composite has been developed with the incorporation of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes and polyvinyl alcohol fiber. This paper reports the mixture process and mechanical tests on EGC with different mixtures. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray powder diffraction were used to investigate the characteristics of the reaction products in the geopolymer matrix. The microscopic morphology of the geopolymer matrix were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy. The excellent saturated multiple cracking properties and strain hardening of the ultra-high EGC (UHEGCs) were demonstrated by uniaxial tension testing. At the maximum limit, the residual crack width and crack spacing of UHEGCs were generally less than 70 ?m and 2 mm, respectively. Tensile strain-hardening behavior with an ultimate tensile strain greater than 8% was experimentally demonstrated for the UHEGC. Meanwhile, the compressive strength of the UHEGC was greater than 45 MPa. The pseudo-strain hardening (PSH) indexes of UHEGC were used to determine the tensile capacity formation. Analysis demonstrated that the tensile capacity of UHEGC can be quantified using the classic PSH criterion, whereas ultra-high crack-bridging capacity was attributed to the ultra-high-ductility of UHEGC. The XRD studies demonstrated that for the reaction products of the geopolymer matrix, new crystalline phases are insignificant. The FT-IR analyses revealed that the amorphous aluminosilicate phases were mainly reaction products, i.e., N-A-S-H. Most importantly, the multi-scale (micro- and meso-scale) modification mechanisms of the material through the addition of two fibers were revealed.

Cyclic voltammograms, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cycle performance of the prepared cathode were investigated. The results indicated that this novel binder not only served as a strong dispersion and adhesion agent for the cathode materials, but also formed a stable electric network between the active material and the conductive carbon. Less polarization, lower transfer resistance, and enhanced cycle life were achieved due to its improved electrochemical stability during the charge/discharge processes. The prepared cathode exhibited an initial capacity of 1135mAhg(1) and a high reversible capacity of 754mAhg(1) after 50 cycles.

Surface coverages between 6 and 100% investigated. A one-layer and a three-layer description of the LiF slab are found to yield virtually the same adsorption energies, adsorbate-substrate distances and vibrational frequencies at all coverages. The relative importance of the molecule-molecule and molecule-surface interactions at the optimized surface-adsorbate distance are presented. For an isolated N-2 molecule physisorbed on Li-s(+), we obtain a shift upwards of +9 cm(-1), only one wavenumber away from the published experimental value. For low surface coverages, the frequency shift of N-2 on Li-s(+) stems entirely from the surface-adsorbate interaction, whereas for HF physisorbed on Li-s(+) (F towards surface), the small upshift found is entirely due to the molecule-molecule interaction within the adlayer. HF molecules hydrogen-bonded on top of F-s(-) are strongly downshifted in frequency. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

By multi-response surface methodology (RSM), this study chose promising metal components (Co, Ce, and W) supported over activated carbon as a catalyst to investigate the catalytic activity of CO2-CH4 reforming. First, the center point of the center-complex design (CCD) based on RSM was determined by single-factor experiment, Co, W and Ce were loaded with 10.1 wt%, 9.7 wt%, and 9.2 wt %, respectively. Then, the three-factor and five-level CCD was exhibited. Four wellmatched quadratic regression models (R-2 is close to 1) were developed to gain a better understanding of the effects of the individual component content and their interactions on CH4 conversion, CO2 conversion, H-2 yield, and CO yield. The results showed that W content was the most important negative parameter affecting the conversion of CH4 and CO2, while the Co and Ce content played a significant positive role in the catalyst performance. The interactive effects of all different component content imposed a significant effect on the CO2 conversion and CO yield. At last, the content optimization suggested that the optimal catalytic activity was achieved at the content of Co, W, and Ce of 10.6 wt%, 6.5 wt%, and 8.6 wt%, respectively, which was validated by a mean error of less than 2.2%.

Additionally, it plays a prominent role during metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells, and SHMT2 inhibitors have proven useful as anticancer drugs. Compared to drugs targeting one-carbon metabolic enzymes (mainly dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase) that have been used for clinical treatment of cancer, efficient SHMT2-specific inhibitors are lacking. Therefore, we established a direct system for virtual screening, protein expression, and identification of inhibitors targeting SHMT2. First, 27 compounds qualifying as potential SHMT2 inhibitors were selected for biological activity verification through virtual screening of the 210 thousand compounds registered in the Specs database. Second, these 27 hits were subjected to quick screening by an in vitro non-competitive kinetic assay of SHMT2 single-enzyme catalysis. This allowed us to identify three compounds featuring medium-strength and non-competitive inhibition of SHMT2: AM-807/42004511 (IC50 = 14.52 +/- 4.1665 mu M), AM-807/40675298 (IC50 = 12.74 +/- 5.8991 mu M), and AM-807/42004633 (IC50 = 9.43 +/- 0.5646 mu M). We describe a quick screening method for the identification of inhibitors targeting SHMT2, providing a basis for subsequent identification and screening of new inhibitors.

Despite decades of intense research efforts, its commercialization remains limited by poor cyclability and safety concerns of lithium metal anodes. One root cause is the parasitic reaction between metallic lithium and the organic liquid electrolyte, resulting in continuous formation of an unstable solid electrolyte interphase, which consumes both active lithium and electrolyte. Until now, it has been challenging to completely shut down the parasitic reaction. We find that a thin-layer coating applied through atomic layer deposition on a hollow carbon host guides lithium deposition inside the hollow carbon sphere and simultaneously prevents electrolyte infiltration by sealing pinholes on the shell of the hollow carbon sphere. By encapsulating lithium inside the stable host, parasitic reactions are prevented, resulting in impressive cycling behavior. We report more than 500 cycles at a high coulombic efficiency of 99% in an ether-based electrolyte at a cycling rate of 0.5 mA/cm(2) and a cycling capacity of 1 mAh/cm(2), which is among the most stable Li anodes reported so far.

Herein, a group of hybrid electrocatalysts is synthesized through a facile one-step treatment of perovskite oxide, D-glucosamine hydrochloride and melamine. The high-performance catalyst comprises a unique hybrid architecture, including the mixed oxide substrate derived from perovskite oxide, the in-situ exsolved NiCo nanoalloys, and the nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) grown from the aforementioned nanoalloy particles. The dispersed NiCo nanoalloy serves as a liaison for efficient charge transfer between metal oxides and NCNT, and thus manages to unlock the high intrinsic activity of the metal oxide-based materials. The hybrid catalyst delivers a promising ORR activity, durability and methanol poisoning tolerance comparable to the expensive benchmark Pt/C catalyst. The zinc-air battery using the hybrid catalyst demonstrates a high open circuit voltage of 1.57 V with a maximum power density of 115 mW cm(-2).

Visible near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy could offer an option, as sampling and transporting large numbers of soil samples in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is extremely difficult. However, the potential for in situ vis-NIR spectra and the optimal algorithms need to be defined in this region. We have therefore evaluated the performance of a deep learning method, multilayer perceptron (MLP), for in situ spectral measurement of soil organic carbon (SOC) with in situ vis-NIR spectroscopy in southeastern Tibet, China. A total of 39 soil cores (maximum depth 1 m), including 547 soil samples taken from each 5-cm depth interval, were collected. The spectra were also measured at each 5-cm depth interval accordingly. After spectral preprocessing, 4,096 MLP models were generated by taking all the combinations from six parameters defined in the MLP. The 10-fold-core cross-validation showed that MLP had a good performance for in situ SOC prediction, and the best MLP model had an R-2 of .92, which were much better than those of the partial least squares regression model (R-2 = .80). The results also suggested that the number of epochs, number of neurons, and dropout rate were the most important parameters in the MLP model. We concluded that in situ vis-NIR spectroscopy coupled with an MLP model has high potential for large-scale SOC monitoring in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our results also provide a reference for rapid hyperparameter optimization using MLP for future soil spectroscopic modeling.

Finite element analysis of combined static loadings on offshore pipe riser repaired with fibre-reinforced composite laminates	JOURNAL OF REINFORCED PLASTICS AND COMPOSITES			English	Article						carbon; finite element analysis; E-glass; Composites; pipe riser		The stress-strain response of an offshore pipe riser subjected to combined internal pressure, tension and bending is studied. Finite element analysis was used to study three conditions of pipe riser - uncorroded, corroded and corroded and repaired with designated laminate orientation of carbon/epoxy or E-glass/epoxy fibre-reinforced composite. The behaviour of the pipe riser (grade API 5L X60 steel) was studied using Ramberg-Osgood model. Two composites laminate systems, a pre-cured prepreg (grade AS4 3501-6 carbon/epoxy) and a wet-layup filament-wounded composite (grade Gevetex LY556/HT917/DY063 E-glass/epoxy), were characterised. Design conditions were determined via a limit analysis known as the double-elastic slope method. The results showed that under combined hoop, tensile and bending loads, the riser tends to approach failure at a much lower strain compared with each of these loads being applied individually. The limiting design factor of the composite repair system was due to excessive tensile strain experienced in a bent riser while the compressive stress caused by reversing the bending load occurred well within the linear-elastic region. With respect to the types of composite repair system, carbon fibre displayed a much better strength rehabilitation over glass fibre. In the aspect of laminate orientation, off-axis plies [90 degrees/ +/- 30 degrees](s) and [90 degrees/ +/- 45 degrees/0 degrees](s) laminates were found capable of restoring the strength of the corroded riser and provide superior reinforcement in both hoop and axial directions.

Collecting and transporting large numbers of soil samples from such terrain are difficult, and we have therefore evaluated the feasibility of scanning with visible near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy in situ for the rapid measurement of the soil in the field. We took 28 cores (approximate to 1 m depth and 5 cm diameter) of soil at altitudes from 2900 to 4500 m in the Sygera Mountains on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Spectra were acquired from fresh, vertical faces 5 x 5 cm in area from the centers of the cores to give 413 spectra in all. The raw spectra were pretreated by several methods to remove noise, and statistical models were built to predict of the organic C in the samples from the spectra by partial least-squares regression (PLSR) and least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). The bootstrap was used to assess the uncertainty of the predictions by the several combinations of pretreatment and models. The predictions by LS-SVM from the field spectra, for which R-2 = 0.81, the root-mean-square error RMSE = 8.40, and the ratio of the interquartile distance RPIQ = 2.66, were comparable to the PLSR predictions from the laboratory spectra (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 7.28, RPIQ = 3.09). We conclude that vis-NIR scanning in situ in the field is a sufficiently accurate rapid means of estimating the concentration of organic C in soil profiles in this high region and perhaps elsewhere.

Large differences in physical and thermal properties between fiber and resin, however, have been prohibiting the application of fiber laser cutting on CFRP composites. Joining of CFRP parts is mainly dependent on mechanical bolting/riveting, which depends critically on the quality of processed holes. In this study, CFRP laminates used for manufacturing new energy vehicles were employed to investigate the hole quality during fiber laser cutting in continuous wave and pulse modes. Statistical analysis was performed to optimize process parameters to minimize heat affected zone (HAZ) levels. Results indicated that thermal defects including matrix recessing/decomposition and protruding and uncut fibers were prevalent at hole entry and exit irrespective of processing parameters. Low level of laser power (800 W) and linear energy (50 J/mm) together with the pulse mode were preferred to minimize HAZ during fiber laser cutting of CFRP laminates, while the effect of a laser mode was negligible. Tensile strength of samples with open hole (6.0 mm diameter) cut by a fiber laser varied from 131 to 143 MPa, which depended to some extent on HAZ levels. Massive delamination, fiber breakage, and splitting bounds were the main damage/failure modes.

However, these low-productivity and water-limited ecosystems are sensitive and vulnerable to climate perturbations and human intervention, the latter of which is often not considered due to lack of spatial information regarding the grassland management. Here by the application of a model tree ensemble (MTE-GRASS) trained on local eddy covariance data and using as predictors gridded climate and management intensity field (grazing and cutting), we first provide an estimate of global grassland gross primary production (GPP). GPP from our study compares well (modeling efficiency NSE = 0.85 spatial; NSE between 0.69 and 0.94 interannual) with that from flux measurement. Global grassland GPP was on average 11 +/- 0.31 Pg C yr(-1) and exhibited significantly increasing trend at both annual and seasonal scales, with an annual increase of 0.023 Pg C (0.2%) from 1982 to 2011. Meanwhile, we found that at both annual and seasonal scale, the trend (except for northern summer) and interannual variability of the GPP are primarily driven by arid/semiarid ecosystems, the latter of which is due to the larger variation in precipitation. Grasslands in arid/semiarid regions have a stronger (33 g C m(-2) yr(-1) /100 mm) and faster (0- to 1-month time lag) response to precipitation than those in other regions. Although globally spatial gradients (71%) and interannual changes (51%) in GPP were mainly driven by precipitation, where most regions with arid/semiarid climate zone, temperature and radiation together shared half of GPP variability, which is mainly distributed in the high-latitude or cold regions. Our findings and the results of other studies suggest the overwhelming importance of arid/semiarid regions as a control on grassland ecosystems carbon cycle. Similarly, under the projected future climate change, grassland ecosystems in these regions will be potentially greatly influenced.

The defect-rich structures of the obtained AB play a critical role in providing more appropriate sites for sulfur atom doping. After a pyrolysis process in the presence of melamine as N doping agent, the sulfur template was decomposed and yielded the N, S-codoped porous carbon material with additional porosity. The synergistic effects between the defect-projecting and heteroatoms-doping boost the activity of electrocatalysts in terms of the enhanced oxygen reduction efficiency and optimized kinetic process, both are better than that of commercial Pt/C. And the improved reactivity between carbon atoms and heteroatoms as well as sulfur and nitrogen atoms greatly suppress the loss of active ingredient of the catalyst, the mechanism yields a striking long-term stability for the unique metal-free OAB@S-N electrocatalyst.

Even if co-firing seems the most attractive solution for near-term applications, processes based on combustion and gasification (which are competing in dependence of the need of heat or electricity) are receiving renewed attention. Thanks to their high carbon content, and their high specific surface area and developed porous structure, biomass-derived chars can be treated and converted into activated carbons and applied in many different field (as energy storage materials for gaseous fuels, mainly hydrogen and methane, or as electrodes). They can constitute the raw materials for preparing synthetic graphite, which can be used in some types of batteries and fuel cells, and in carbon electrodes for electrochemical capacitors. The performances in terms of capacitance, electrical conductivity, potential, charge and discharge rates, power density, etc. have been reported to be very close to those of commercial devices. The recent progress in the activation protocols brought to higher fuel gas storage capacities, especially in cryogenic conditions and under high pressure, and opened the possibility to apply these materials in new application fields. In catalysis, advances in the use of biomass-derived chars and active carbons have been made thanks to the improvement of the modification techniques. The optimization of the engineering methodologies allows to lower the cost of the activation processes of biomass-derived chars and to tune the char properties to adapt them to the final application. The present paper aims to give a comprehensive survey of already-well-established or future potential energy applications of biomass-derived chars. A critical comparison of their use in different processes is reported and their modification by various catalytic, physical and chemical routes is detailed.

SD and TOF numbers have remained elusive for PGM-free, metal/nitrogen-doped porous carbon electrocatalysts (MNC), in particular, FeNC materials that are now intensively investigated and widely utilized to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cell cathodes. Here, we apply CO cryo sorption and desorption to evaluate SD and TOF numbers of a state-of-art FeNC ORR electrocatalyst with atomically dispersed coordinative FeNx (x <= 4) sites in acid and alkaline conditions. More specifically, we study the impact of thermal pretreatment conditions prior to assessing the number of sorption-active FeNx sites. We show that the pretreatment temperature sensitively affects the CO sorption uptake through a progressive thermal removal of airborne adsorbates, which, in turn, controls the resulting catalytic SD numbers. We correlate CO uptake with CO desorption and analyze the observed temperature-programmed desorption characteristics. The CO uptakes increased from 45 nmol.mg(catalyst)(-1) at 300 degrees C cleaning to 65 nmol.mg(catalyst)(-1) at 600 degrees C cleaning, where it leveled off. These values were converted into apparent SD values of 2.7 x 10(19) to 3.8 x 10(19) surface sites per gram catalyst. Because of similar ORR activity of the pristine catalyst and of the sample after 600 degrees C cleaning step, we conclude that the nature and number of surface FeNx sites remained largely unaffected up to 600 degrees C and that cleaning to less than 600 degrees C was insufficient to free the sites from previously adsorbed species, completely or partially impeding CO adsorption. Cleaning beyond that temperature, however, led to undesired chemical modifications of the FeNx moieties, resulting in higher TOF. In all, this study identifies and recommends a practical and useful protocol for the accurate evaluation of catalytic SD and TOF parameters of PGM-free ORR electrocatalyst, which enables a more rational future catalyst development and improvement.

Herein, we report a novel SiNWs@Co(3)O(4)Z-scheme heterojunction photocathode with carbon quantum dots eco-friendly derived from sludge (SCQDs) as the co-catalyst. The photocathode not only leads to effective separation of electron-hole pair, lower transmission resistance, and longer lifetime of charge carriers, but also elevates the stability by preventing direct contact between the SiNWs and the electrolyte as well as the self-oxidation. Simultaneously, the excellent electron transport properties of the SCQDs further improved the PEC performance. Correspondingly, a maximum current density of 14.88 mA.cm(-2) was obtained at -0.67 V with the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) achieving 8.4% under visible light irradiations at pH = 7. This work provides a promising scheme for Si-based pho-tocathodes for PEC hydrogen production with a high performance, reliable stability, and low-cost. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The obtained MOF-CoSe2 exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance: it shows a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), a low onset potential of 150 mV; it delivers a high current density and excellent long-term stability. Such enhancement can be attributed to the unique N-doped MOFs derived architecture with high conductivity, which can not only provide abundant active reaction sites, but also ensure robust contact between the CoSe2 nanoparticles and N-doped carbon matrix, leading to outstanding electrocatalytic activity for HER.

The optimal way to minimize these problems could be a construction of a nanocomposite cathode scaffold combining different components selected for their particular functions. Here, we have combined the excellent electronic conductivity of reduced graphene oxide, polysulfide adsorption ability of the ultrafine manganese oxide nanocrystals, rapid ion/electron dissemination efficiency of nanosized sulfur, and outstanding mechanical stiffness and good electrical conductivity of Na alginate/polyaniline hybrid binder in a single electrode heterostructure. At 0.2 A g(-1), an RT Na-S battery containing the freestanding cathode delivers an initial specific cap acity of 631 mA h g(-1) By delivering a nominal discharge voltage of 1.81 V, our Na S batteries bestow a high specific energy of 737 W h kg-' at the 2nd cycle and 660 W h kg(-1) was retained after 50 cycles. The effect of the amount of electrolyte additive is also well demonstrated in this study. The electrode fabrication process provides a new approach to tailor the design and preparation of effective cathodes for the room-temperature sodium sulfur batteries.

Besides, C-O-Mn bonding is demonstrated to greatly promote the Faradic reactions of the composite, resulting in the enhancement of its real capacity in supercapacitor (SC) electrodes as well as lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes. By simply fine-tuning the content of graphene (<7 wt %), the composite with 2.8 wt % of rGO delivers a high capacitance of 315 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) with a high rate capability of 64,7% at 30 A g(-1) and an excellent cycling stability of 105% (5 A g(-1), 5000 cycles) as an SC electrode. Also, the one with 6.9 wt % rGO can present a reversible capacity of more than 1500 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 A g(-1) as the LIB anode, the highest value reported to date, which remains 561 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1).

Silicon anodes can be used both in traditional lithium-ion batteries and in more recent Li-O-2 and Li-S batteries as a replacement for the dendrite-forming lithium metal anodes. The main challenges associated with silicon anodes are structural degradation and instability of the solid-electrolyte interphase caused by the large volume change (similar to 300%) during cycling, the occurrence of side reactions with the electrolyte, and the low volumetric capacity when the material size is reduced to a nanometre scale(4-7). Here, we propose a hierarchical structured silicon anode that tackles all three of these problems. Our design is inspired by the structure of a pomegranate, where single silicon nanoparticles are encapsulated by a conductive carbon layer that leaves enough room for expansion and contraction following lithiation and delithiation. An ensemble of these hybrid nanoparticles is then encapsulated by a thicker carbon layer in micrometre-size pouches to act as an electrolyte barrier. As a result of this hierarchical arrangement, the solid-electrolyte interphase remains stable and spatially confined, resulting in superior cyclability (97% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles). In addition, the microstructures lower the electrode-electrolyte contact area, resulting in high Coulombic efficiency (99.87%) and volumetric capacity (1,270 mAh cm(-3)), and the cycling remains stable even when the areal capacity is increased to the level of commercial lithium-ion batteries (3.7 mAh cm(-2)).

Generation of toxic degradation products by sonication of Pluronic (R) dispersants: implications for nanotoxicity testing	NANOTOXICOLOGY			English	Article						nanotoxicology; nanoparticles; poloxamer; carbon nanotubes; ultrasound	MASS-SPECTROMETRIC ANALYSIS; ULTRASONIC DEGRADATION; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; POLY(ETHYLENE OXIDE); CARBON NANOTUBES; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; CAVITATION; POLYMERS; POLYACRYLAMIDE; SONOCHEMISTRY	Poloxamers (known by the trade name Pluronic (R)) are triblock copolymer surfactants that contain two polyethylene glycol blocks and one polypropylene glycol block of various sizes. Poloxamers are widely used as nanoparticle dispersants for nanotoxicity studies wherein nanoparticles are sonicated with a dispersant to prepare suspensions. It is known that poloxamers can be degraded during sonication and that reactive oxygen species contribute to the degradation process. However, the possibility that poloxamer degradation products are toxic to mammalian cells has not been well studied. We report here that aqueous solutions of poloxamer 188 (Pluronic (R) F-68) and poloxamer 407 (Pluronic (R) F-127) sonicated in the presence or absence of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) can became highly toxic to cultured cells. Moreover, toxicity correlated with the sonolytic degradation of the polymers. These findings suggest that caution should be used in interpreting the results of nanotoxicity studies where the potential sonolytic degradation of dispersants was not controlled.

In this study, we first combine the advantages of carbon-supported Pt-type structures and MSD to prepare a carbon-sphere-supported Pt catalyst. Compare to conventional chemical methods, the Pt/C catalyst prepare by MSD has some characteristics such as easy to prepare, high Pt utilization, and non-polluting. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the sputtered-Pt/ C is increased by 34% compare with the commercial-Pt/C with the same Pt loading. Moreover, the testing results for the single cell indicate that the rated power density of the sputtered-Pt/C catalyst is 26.7% higher than that of the commercial-Pt/C catalyst under H-2/air test conditions. We are optimistic that this sputtered-Pt/C catalyst could have broad applications in commercial fuel cells. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We present an in-situ method for measuring permeability of membranes to crossover redox species. The method employs a 'Swagelok' cell design equipped with a glassy carbon working electrode, in which redox species are placed initially in the counter electrode compartment only. Permeability through the membrane, which separates working and counter electrodes, is determined using a square wave voltammetry technique that allows the concentration of crossover redox species to be evaluated over time with very high precision. We test the method using a model and well-behaved electrochemical system to demonstrate its sensitivity, reproducibility and reliability relative to alternative approaches. This new method offers advantages in terms of small electrolyte volume, and simple, fast, quantitative and in-situ measurement. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many important properties of NPGs are determined by their structural regularity and homogeneity. The mass production of NPGs with periodic well-defined pore structures under a solvent-free green synthesis poses a great challenge and is largely unexplored. A facile synthetic strategy of NPGs via pressing organization calcination (POC) of readily available halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is developed. The gram-scale synthesized NPGs have ordered structures and possess well-defined nanopores, which can be easily exfoliated to few layers and oxidized in controllable approaches. After being decorated with oxygen species, the oxidized NPGs with tunable catalytic centers exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability toward electrochemical hydrogen peroxide generation.

Vertically grown carbon nanotubes are used as a template for the cylindrical pores to achieve high porosity while maintaining structural stability. Measurements show that an elastic modulus of 17.5 GPa can be maintained even at 65% porosity to provide sufficient mechanical strength for most back end of line processes. This represents a 94% improvement in mechanical stability compared with the state-of-the-art low-k dielectrics. The tradeoffs between dielectric constant and elastic modulus of different porous structures have also been studied to project the ultimate achievable k-value.

After working for a long time, the end face of the internal mixer will be worn. The abrasion of the end face can increase the gap between the mixing chamber and the end face, and then material leakage occurs, which reduces the mixing effect and affects the performance of rubber compound. Therefore, it is very necessary to study the wear of the end face in the mixing process. As one-dimensional nanomaterial, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a perfect hexagonal structure and many unusual mechanical, electrical and chemical properties. In recent years, with the deepening of the research of CNTs and nanomaterial's, their broad application prospects have also been continuously revealed. This paper analyzes the influence of rubber compounds with different CNTs content on the friction and wear of the end face from the perspective of formulation, and the correlation between corrosive wear and abrasive wear is studied. In the present study, it is found that as CNTs increase, the proportion of abrasive wear increases, the proportion of corrosive wear decreases, and the amount of the metal wear decreases. With the increase of CNTs, the hindering effect of CNTs on SiO2 molecules is strengthened, the degree of silanization reaction is reduced, the output of high-temperature water vapor is reduced, and the corrosive wear of the metal is reduced. The spatial structure of CNTs is a cylinder with hexagonal plane, and it has extremely high toughness and softness, so it has slight wear on the metal. On the one hand, CNTs hinder the movement of SiO2 molecules. On the other hand, because CNTs have the wrapping effect on SiO2 molecules, some silica aggregates have no direct contact with the metal, CNTs become the medium for silica aggregates to contact with the metal. Therefore, with the increase of CNTs, the proportion of abrasive wear gradually increases, but the total amount of the metal wear gradually decreases.

For anode, Stabilized Lithium Metal Powder (SLMP) was successfully transformed into lithiated graphite anode. For cathode, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that SiO2 was uniformly distributed on S/PAN composites, where SiO2 served as an effective additive due to its ultra high absorb ability and enhanced ability in trapping soluble polysulfide. The tested half-cell based on S/PAN/SiO2 composite revealed high discharge capacity of 1106 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C. The full cell based on prelithiated graphite//S/PAN/SiO2 composite system delivered a specific capacity of 810 mAh g(-1) over 100 cycles.

However, they suffer from energy and power decay due to the formation of lithium sulfide that has low ionic/electronic conductivity and a strong Li-S bond. Herein, we overcome these challenges by incorporating the catalytic LiI-LiBr compound and carbon black into MoS2. The comprehensive simulations, characterizations, and electrochemical evaluations demonstrated that LiI-LiBr significantly reduces Li+/S2- interaction and increases the ionic conductivity of Li2S, thus enhancing the reaction kinetics and Li2S/S redox reversibility. MoS2@LiI-LiBr@C parallel to Li cells with an areal capacity of 0.87 mAh cm(-2) provide a reversible capacity of 816.2 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) and maintain 604.8 mAh g(-1) (based on the mass of MoS2) for 100 cycles. At a high areal capacity of 2 mAh cm(-2), the battery still delivers reversible capacity of 498 mAh g(-1). LiI-LiBr-carbon additive can be broadly applied for all transition-metal sulfide cathodes to enhance the cyclic and rate performance.

However, their extra safety and cost issues caused by high-temperature inhibits their wide application. Recently, room-temperature Na-S batteries have attracted widespread attention due to the low cost and excellent energy density. Nevertheless, they still suffer from the poor conductivity, sluggish redox kinetics and shuttle effect. Herein, the incorporated polar Co3C-Co with open fluorinated carbon nanotubes arrays encapsulated in porous three-dimensional (3D) framework (FCNT@Co3C-Co) was designed and applied as the sulfur host for Na-S battery. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the polar and porous FCNT@Co3C-Co possesses the strong interactions with Na+ and S intermediate species (NaPSs), which increases the sulfide utilization and suppresses the shuttle effect by the efficient physisorption/chemisorption and rapid electrocatalytic conversion. Moreover, the synergy of the porous cube-like framework and superior interface property in FCNT@Co3C-Co mitigates the huge volume variations and reduces the energy barrier for Na-S battery. Hence, the FCNT@Co3C-Co based Na-S batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 1364 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C even with a lean E/S of 5 mL g(-1) under a high S loading of 3.2 mg cm(-2) and show Coulombic efficiency above 75% after 500 loops under 2 C at room-temperature.

Here, the direct effects of BC emissions from India (IDBC) and China (CNBC) are investigated in East Asia during summer using the state-of-the-art regional climate model RegCM4. In summer, IDBC and CNBC account for approximately 30% and 46% of the total BC emissions in Asia, respectively. The total BC column burden from the two countries and corresponding TOA effective radiative forcing are 1.58 mg m(-2) and +1.87 W m(-2) in East Asia, respectively. The regional air temperature increases over 0.3 K at maximum and precipitation decreases 0.028 mm day(-1) on average. Individually, IDBC and CNBC each can bring about rather different effects on regional climate. IDBC can result in a cooling perturbation accompanied by a substantially increased cloud amount and scattering aerosol loading, resulting in a complex response in the regional precipitation, while CNBC can lead to regional warming, and further induce a local flood in northern China or drought in southern China depending on the opposite but significant circulation anomalies. CNBC plays a dominant role in modulating the regional climate over East Asia due to its higher magnitude, wider coverage, and stronger climate feedback. The direct effect of the total BC from both countries is not a linear combination of that of IDBC and CNBC individually, suggesting that the regional climate responses are highly nonlinear to the emission intensity or aerosol loading, which may be greatly related to the influences of the perturbed atmospheric circulations and climate feedback.

It was discovered that the resulting nanoflower-like CNQDs@MA-Ag nanocomposites could exhibit the peroxidase-like catalysis, which could be specifically enhanced by Hg2+ by forming Ag@Hg alloys. A double catalysis-based colorimetric method was thereby developed for the fast detecting of Hg2+ and Hg-0 in wastewater samples, with the levels down to 0.050 nM and 18.3 nM, respectively. Moreover, strong visible-light-driven photocatalysis of the nanocomposites was demonstrated for oxidizing Hg-0 into Hg2+ through photocatalytic H2O2 production so as to realize the detoxification of Hg-0 in the environmental wastewater. Besides, the fabricated mesoporous CNQDs@MA-Ag nano composites with large specific surface areas might facilitate the high Hg adsorption through the powerful MA-Hg chelate interaction, showing the efficient adsorption and/or removal of total Hg. The catalysis-selective colorimetric analysis and photocatalysis-based detoxification removal of total mercury may promise for wide applications in the environmental monitoring and wastewater treatment of toxic heavy metals of mercury.

The variation of PI molecular chains and frictional interface properties were explored for understanding microscopic tribological mechanism of different oriented CNTs. The average friction coefficients of PI composites reinforced by X-, Y-, and Z-oriented CNTs were 0.242, 0.270, and 0.243. Meanwhile, the abrasion rates of XCNT, YCNT, and ZCNT were 11.5% 34.8%, and 28.0%, respectively. The atomic concentration, interfacial temperature and shear strength of XCNT and ZCNT were higher than those of YCNT. The radial distribution function was simulated and interpreted during the friction process to determine the inherent interaction between PI molecular chains and CNTs with specific orientations.

Based on comparison of these constants (trans-(3)J(C,H) (E isomer) > cis-(3)J(C,H) (Z isomer)), the Z configuration was assigned to acyclic nitrones. Coordination of organolithium compounds to the oxygen atom of the N-->O group was revealed by C-13 NMR spectroscopy. This coordination is the necessary condition for the metallation of aldonitrones. The configuration of the nitrone group is responsible for the ability of the E form of acyclic aldonitrones to undergo CD3ONa-catalyzed isotope exchange of the methine proton in CD3OD and metallation with (BuLi)-Li-s.

In this paper, we address a reverse logistics network design problem regarding carbon emission. The problem is formulated as a bi-objective, mixed-integer, and nonlinear programming model under various operation technologies and transport modes in the truck tire remanufacturing industry. An improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) solves this NP-hard problem with bi-objectives. The numerical cases demonstrate the validation of the proposed model and the advantage of improved NSGA-II over the basic NSGA-II. Furthermore, we conducted extensive sensitivity analysis, and several managerial insights are derived.

J	Guo, H; Li, S; Kang, SZ; Du, TS; Tong, L; Ding, RS				Guo, Hui; Li, Sien; Kang, Shaozhong; Du, Taisheng; Tong, Ling; Ding, Risheng			Annual ecosystem respiration of maize was primarily driven by crop growth and soil water conditions	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Carbon dioxide emission; Ecosystem respiration; Eddy covariance; Drip irrigation under film mulch; Maize	CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; ORGANIC-MATTER DECOMPOSITION; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; CO2 EFFLUX; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; SEASONAL-VARIATION; SPRUCE FOREST; LONG-TERM	In the context of global warming, carbon dioxide emissions have become a global concern. Cropland respiration is an important component of carbon dioxide emissions from terrestrial ecosystem. A large number of studies have investigated cropland respiration, although many controversies remain about its interannual variations and mechanisms. In this study, an eddy covariance instrument was used to observe carbon fluxes in a maize field for four consecutive years (2014-2017) in the arid region of Northwest China. The night-time respiration rates measured by eddy covariance were used to validate the accuracy of the Van't Hoff, Arrhenius, and Taylor models in estimating the respiration rate of a maize field. All three models performed well, although the Van't Hoff model had the highest accuracy. The three models were used to simultaneously estimate the respiration rate of the maize field throughout the growth season. The results showed that in the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, the annual respiration rates were 485, 1063, 711, and 651 g m(-2)y(-1), respectively. Surprisingly, the respiration rate in 2015 was markedly higher than that in the other three years, and the values were 119%, 49%, and 63% higher than the rates in 2014, 2016, and 2017, respectively. To interpret this observation, this article analyzed the relationships between the respiration rate in the maize field ecosystem and the maximum leaf area index, air temperature, soil surface temperature, and soil water content. The results show that at the interannual scale, the ecosystem respiration showed significant linear positive correlations with the maximum leaf area index and soil water content. The highest values for canopy area, net radiation, irrigation rate, and soil water content were observed in 2015; the crop biomass in 2015 was also greater than that in the other three years, which significantly increased the crop respiration and caused 2015 to have the highest respiration rate. The results showed that at the interannual scale, crop growth and soil surface water conditions were the critical determinants of respiration. This study provided a new perspective and a basis for an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of carbon dioxide emission in croplands.

A gas mixture consisting of methane (CH,) and hydrogen was bled into the system using one of two inlet positions located at the top and the bottom of the reactor. The latter position was close to the vacuum pump outlet. It was found that the carburizing results obtained with each gas inlet position differ significantly even though all other parameters (temperature, pressure, current density, flow rate and treatment time) were identical. The carburizing results are discussed in view of different mass transfer rates of carbon species in the plasma in the two different positions. It is concluded that when the gas inlet is located at the bottom of the reactor a large proportion of the methane molecules are not reaching the plasma reaction zone efficiently as their concentration in the stream is depleted faster than with flow from the opposite position, and this affects the active carburizing capacity of the plasma.

To improve their electrochemical performances, we investigated the electrochemical reactions of the SEs and their structural changes. The detailed changes in the structure and electronic states have not yet been measured experimentally because of the difficulty in observing the microscopic area formed at the interface between the electrode materials and the SEs. Thus, we prepared composite electrodes composed of Li3PS4 SE and carbon to increase the electrochemical reaction area. The structural and electronic-state changes in Li3PS4 during the Li deinsertion-insertion processes were revealed using X-ray diffraction and Raman, X-ray photoelectron, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies. We found that the sulfide ions in Li3PS4 contribute to charge compensation during the charge-discharge processes. The S-S bonds between PS4 units associate and dissociate via the retention of the covalent bonds between the P atoms and S-S bonds. Although the anion redox behavior is generally discussed with regard to transition metal chalcogenides, here we first report the reversible association and dissociation of S-S bonds in typical element compounds. This knowledge contributes to an improved understanding of the anion redox reactions and the interfacial resistances between high-voltage positive electrodes and SEs.

Needle-like CoO nanowire composites with NiO nanosheets on carbon cloth for hybrid flexible supercapacitors and overall water splitting electrodes	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; BIFUNCTIONAL ELECTROCATALYSTS; HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE; CYCLE STABILITY; NICKEL FOAM; PERFORMANCE; OXYGEN; ARRAYS; EFFICIENT; ULTRATHIN	A nanoscale core-shell NiO@CoO composite is prepared on flexible carbon cloth for electrodes in supercapacitors and overall water splitting. The needle-like CoO nanowires with NiO nanosheets as the active materials improve the elemental constituents as well as surface area. The NiO@CoO electrode boasts a capacity of 2.87 F cm(-2)(1024.05 F g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1)current density, and even at a large current density of 20 A g(-1)the retention ratio is 80.9% after 5000 cycles. The excellent specific capacity with high rate capability can be ascribed to the unique structure which increases the area of the liquid-solid interface and facilitates electron and ion transport, improving the utilization efficiency of active materials. The asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor prepared with the core-shell electrode shows the energy output of 40.3 W h kg(-1)at 750 W kg(-1)with a better retention (71.7%) of specific capacitance after 15 000 cycles. In addition, linear sweep voltammetry is performed to assess the performance of the electrode in water splitting and the electrode shows excellent activity in the OER as manifested by a Tafel slope of 88.04 mV dec(-1). Our results show that the bifunctional structure and design strategy have large potential in energy applications.

However, the traditional synthesis methods are often complex, expensive, and thus not applicable to large-scale industrial productions. In this work, an ecofriendly and multifunctional Fe-humic acid (HA) complex was successfully prepared through simply ball milling lignite with double-shelled Fe-N hollow mesoporous carbon microspheres (DS-Fe-NHC). The novel DS-Fe-N-HC was synthesized using a simple strategy and was first applied in activating HA from lignite by solid-phase ball milling to attain the water-soluble HA-iron fertilizer (WHIF). The physicochemical properties of the DS-Fe-N-HC nanocomposites and WHIF were systematically characterized by a series of techniques. A traditional Fe-HA complex is mainly obtained by mixing HA and iron ions, which has poor water solubility because HA is not activated. In comparison to samples prepared with other methods, WHIF contained more stable water-soluble HA. Furthermore, the as-obtained WHIF had higher amounts of proteins and amino sugar tannin as evidenced in FT-ICR MS analysis. Moreover, WHIF contributed to higher activities in chlorophyll content, height, steam diameter, and biomass of peanuts than other samples. The results demonstrate that WHIF is effective in reducing symptoms of iron deficiency in peanuts, which can be attributed to its iron-based compounds and water-soluble HA. The findings of this study provide a promising, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly solution to mitigate iron deficiency and promote the growth of peanuts for large-scale agriculture production.

In this research, we design a new type multifunctional aerogel material, which not only can applied for supuercapacitors, but also acted as adsorbents for adsorb organic pollutant. This multifunctional aerogel was prepared by one-pot hydrothermal and freeze-drying method based on elongated TiO2 nanotubes (eTNTs) and graphene. During the hydrothermal process, the graphene nanosheets and eTNTs self-assembled into three-dimensional (3D) interconnected networks, in which the eTNTs with uniform size are intercalate the pore interconnected framework. The results show that the as-prepared eTNTs/graphene aerogel (TGA) exhibits a high specific surface area of 343.2 m(2) g(-1). The highly porous and interconnected 3D nanostructure provided efficient migration of electrolyte ions and electrons, and thus the TGA exhibited excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. The binder free TGA electrode possessed high performance electrochemical properties with an excellent specific capacitance (476.8 F g(-1) at scan rate of 5 mV s(-1)), and outstanding cycle stability (92% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). In addition, the TGA also showed admirable adsorption capacity for organic pollutant of bisphenol A, which reached 523.5 mg g(-1). The excellent electrochemical and adsorption capacities suggest the TGA to be the promising materials application in energy storage and environmental remediation.

During the initial stage of plasma nitrocarburising, highly porous surface structures are formed similar to those described as ''the open structure of a piece of coral'' observed in salt bath nitrocarburising. For a 9 min treated sample a triple layer composed of cementile, compound layer and nitrogen austenite is formed, which further develops into epsilon iron nitride containing a compound layer and the dissociated nitrogen austenite sublayer. Porosity is mainly nucleated and grows at the grain boundaries, the carbon-enriched region and places where alpha-iron forms. The structures of quenched and annealed samples were also examined. Pure epsilon compound top layer can be retained after quenching. This layer is unstable at this gas composition and transforms to gamma', alpha-iron (and Fe3C) containing epsilon during slow cooling. Annealing enhances the core property of the plain carbon steel by transforming the martensite and residual nitrogen austenite into bainite.

The Kirkendall cavitation process is a typical method of producing hollow structured nanoparticles. It should be noted that only precursors with proper diffusion couples can guarantee a successful preparation. In this work, based on a matching diffusion rate of graphene with that of iron atoms, hollow iron carbides nanoparticles anchoring on N-doped reduced graphene oxides (hollow Fe3C/N-rGO) are designed via a simple carbonization synthesis method. As expected, the obtained Fe3C/N-rGO exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance both in oxygen reduction (E-1/2 = 0.829 V) and evolution reactions. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries are assembled based on the composite, which can also deliver a notable peak power density (160.2 mW cm(-2)), long cycle life (over 300 cycles) and deformable property.

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) hamper the widespread application of LOBs. Herein, an elaborate designed catalysts which are constructed by FeNx moieties dispersed on the network-like hollow dodecahedral carbon and then decorated with Ru nanoparticles (FeNx-HDC@Ru). Since the homogeneously dispersed FeNx moieties could promote ORR performance, and the Ru nanoparticles could facilitate OER capability, the FeNx-HDC@Ru nanocomposites used as cathode catalysts can significantly improve LOBs performance. A lower discharge and charge overpotentials of 0.15 V and 0.78 V can be detected in the first cycle, respectively, and an excellent cycle performance of 90 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) and 89 cycles at 500 mA g(-1) can be demonstrated. Herein, the charge transfer kinetics has been enhanced with the internal network like hollow structure and a low impedance Li2O2/catalysts contact interface could be earned by the constructed Ru nanoparticles, these factors would lead to an efficient acceleration to the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 during discharge and charge process.

With decades of top-down energy conservation and pollutant mitigation policies, the techno-mitigation space has gradually shrunk, while more mitigation space is required for a systematic approach. To help to uncover CO2 mitigation effects, location and better pathways from a systematic perspective, this paper combines disparity analysis and social network analysis to investigate the synergistic emissions reduction effect of urban agglomerations in three representative Chinese urban agglomerations, namely the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRD), Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration (CY) and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao urban agglomeration (GHM). Based on understanding of the carbon emission disparity characteristics of the three urban agglomerations using disparity analysis, this study uses sodal network analysis to study the synergistic CO2 reductions in each urban agglomeration from three perspectives: overall, individual, and connection. The findings emphasize that CY presented the greatest synergistic development capacity but with weak driving ability, indicating that overall synergistic emission reduction was difficult to achieve in a short period. GHM presented obvious fragmentation between the core and peripheral cities, resulting in a weak synergistic mitigation effect. YRD highlighted a solid synergistic development capacity with strong driving ability by its developed cities, thus generating the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions in the short and middle terms. Different cities assume different roles in synergistic CO(2 )reduction. Our results can be expected to enlighten more regionally oriented CO2 mitigation policy implications from an urban agglomeration perspective. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, in addition to the severe shuttle effect, the inhomogeneous deposition of the insoluble sulfur species generated during the discharge/charge processes also contributes to the rapid capacity fade of RT-Na-S batteries. In this work, the deposition behavior of the insoluble sulfur species in the traditional slurry-coated sulfur cathodes is investigated using microporous carbon spheres as model sulfur host materials. To achieve uniform deposition of insoluble sulfur species, a self-supporting sulfur cathode fabricated by assembling microporous carbon spheres is designed. With homogeneous sulfur distribution and favorable electron transport pathway, the self-supporting cathode delivers remarkably enhanced rate capability(509 mA center dot h/g at 2.5 C, 1 C=1675 mA center dot h/g), cycling stability(718 mA center dot h/g after 480 cycles at 0.5 C) and areal capacity(4.98 mA center dot h/cm(2) at 0.1 C), highlighting the great potential of manipulating insoluble sulfur species to fabricate high-performance RT-Na-S batteries.

The effects of the injected CO2 concentration on the amount of wax precipitation from the three oils have been studied at the reservoir temperatures and pressures. Considerable wax precipitations have been detected as the injected CO2 concentration exceeds 50 mol %, and the amount of wax precipitation increases with the injected CO2 concentration. The hydrocarbons extracted into the vapor phase during the multiple-contact extraction process using CO2 have been observed to be mainly limited to C-1-C-5. The onset temperatures of wax precipitations from the CO2-saturated Xinli reservoir oil and the Xinli reservoir oil have been detected using a solid detection system (SDS) logging system at the reservoir pressure. The results show that the onset temperature of the Xinli reservoir oil is decreased as the saturation of CO2 at the reservoir pressure increases. These results, together with those of multiple-contact extraction experiments, suggest that the wax precipitation under CO2 injection may be caused by the extraction of light hydrocarbons from the reservoir oils.

The photocatalyst exhibited high degradation efficiency for sulfamethazine (SMT) through photocatalysis under simulated solar light. The optimized material was composed of anatase, rutile, titanate and g-C3N4 crystalline phases. In situ transformation of titanate to anatase and rutile with specific content proportion (similar to 80:20, P25-type composition) leaded to formation of nanoscale "hot spots" at rutile-anatase-titanate interfaces, and then subsequent charge transfer occurred. Large specific surface area of TNTs as skeleton resulted in high-efficient interface reaction, while heterojunction with g-C3N4 further extended the adsorption to visible light region and retarded electron-hole pairs recombination. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated the SMT sites with high Fukui nucleophilic (f) index prefered to be attacked by radacils. Reduced toxicity of SMT degradation intermediates, good reusability and stability of g-C3N4/TNTs all suggested the great application potential in practical water treatment area.

This article is a continuation of our previous studies, where the hydrothermal method was used to grow Ni3S4 on the carbon nanofiber network. The physicochemical properties of Ni3S4/CNFs were characterized by XRD, SEM, and XPS methods. Afterward, a Ni-Zn battery was assembled, and its electrochemical properties were analyzed using an electrochemical workstation and a Land system. The discharge specific capacity reached 215 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 5 A g(-1). After 100 cycles, the battery retained a specific discharge capacity of 176 mA h g(-1) and a retention rate of around 82%. A series of tests indicated that the application of Ni3S4/CNFs in aqueous rechargeable Ni-Zn batteries is a feasible and promising approach.

It was found that the synergistic effect between solid lubricants graphite blended with g-C3N4 and reinforced fibers on friction and wear performance. Extremely lower friction and wear behavior of TPI composite is attained with aramid pulps (APs) at high temperatures. More importantly, an obvious transition of wear rate and friction took place with aramid pulps under 200 degrees C. When the cross-sections of the transfer films were analyzed using focused ion beam transmission electron microscopy (FIB-TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), it was found that graphite and g-C3N4 combined with APs led to simultaneous improvement in load-carrying capability of TPI matrix and durability of tribofilms subjected to complex physical and chemical reaction. Our work discloses a route for developing the TPI composite exposed to high temperatures with extremely lower friction and wear rate.

However, few studies have been conducted to quantify the relative contributions of these factors to SOC stabilization at various N addition levels in alpine habitats. We established a N manipulation experiment from 2015 to 2016 in an alpine meadow on the QTP to examine the impacts of N addition gradients on SOC stabilization under different scenarios of N deposition including 8, 24, 40, 56, and 72 kg N ha-1 yr- 1. Using solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, we assessed the changes in the chemical composition of SOC. We measured soil aggregate size fractions, iron ions, soil microbes, and soil chemicals to investigate their contributions to SOC stabilization. We found that there were response thresholds of SOC to N addition in this alpine meadow on the QTP. The critical level of N addition for the change of SOC was close to 16 kg N ha-1 yr- 1 plus the natural atmospheric N deposition (approximately 8 kg N ha-1 yr- 1). N addition affected SOC stabilization in this alpine meadow mainly by affecting soil aggregates and soil microbes. These results of this study suggest that an exogenous N input lower than the critical load is beneficial for C sequestration in this alpine meadow on the QTP. This is potentially important for understanding the influences of atmospheric N deposition on soil properties, with subsequent effects on SOC stabilization on the alpine meadow of QTP and similar fragile ecosystems worldwide.

However, the widely application of FeS2 in rechargeable battery is still hindered by the low efficiency and poor cycle performance caused by the generation of elemental Fe and S during fully discharge and charge. Herein, we demonstrate a facile but effective strategy to improve the energy efficiency and cycling stability of Li-FeS2 battery by rational design of a novel micro/nano-structured FeS2 electrode, which exhibits as a microsphere constructed by numerous nanosheets. By optimizing the electrochemical experiments conditions, a high energy efficiency of 80.4% and a high reversible capacity of 216.8 mAh g(-1) retained after 730 cycles at the optimized voltage window of 1.0-2.4 V. The conversion process at higher (> 2.4 V) potentials to form FeSy and S has been suppressed as demonstrated by multiple characterizations. And the Li+ insertion/extraction reaction between Li2FeS2 and Li-2-xFeS(2) and the conversion reaction at lower potential range coexist and are highly reversible. The high reversibility could be mainly ascribed to the micro/nano-structured feature of FeS2 and the optimization of the voltage window. We believe that, our work could further enhance the fundamental understanding of battery reaction mechanism in the rechargeable Li-FeS2 battery.

Soil respiration, one of the largest carbon fluxes in global carbon cycle, is sensitive to precipitation change in semiarid ecosystems. In this study, a field experiment with fungicide application and water addition was conducted during 2010-2013 in a semiarid steppe in Inner Mongolia, China, and soil respiration was continuously measured to investigate the influences of AMF on soil respiration under different precipitation regimes. Results showed that soil respiration was promoted by water addition treatment especially during drought seasons, which induced a nonlinear response of soil respiration to precipitation change. Fungicide application suppressed AMF root colonization without impacts on soil microbes. AMF suppression treatment accelerated soil respiration with 2.7, 28.5 and 37.6 g Cm-2 across three seasons, which were mainly caused by the enhanced heterotrophic component. A steeper response of soil respiration rate to precipitation was found under fungicide application treatments, suggesting a greater dampening effect of AMF on soil carbon release as water availability increased. Our study highlighted the importance of AMF on soil carbon stabilization and sequestration in semiarid steppe ecosystems especially during wet seasons.

Previous reports showed a powerful protective effect of CpG-ODN against the damage induced by low-LET gamma-rays. In this study, we explored whether CpG-ODN also protects against the damage induced by high-LET irradiation. Parallel experiments were performed with low-LET irradiation. Methods: RAW264.7 cells were incubated with 1 mu M of CpG-ODN after gamma-ray or carbon-beam irradiation. Cell death was then measured by PI/DAPI double staining, cell survival was assessed by colony-formation assays, DNA damage was evaluated by comet assays, cell cycle was monitored by flow cytometry, and the levels of apoptosis-related proteins were detected by western blots. Results: When irradiated cells were treated with the CpG-ODN, cell viability decreased, cell survival increased, DNA damage and G(2)/M-phase arrest were ameliorated, and apoptosis was inhibited. Conclusions: The CpG-ODN showed protective effects against low-LET gamma-ray and high-LET carbon-beam irradiation. These effects might be associated with the repair of DNA damage and inhibition of apoptosis. Copyright (C) 2014 S.

A highly-safe lithium-ion sulfur polymer battery with SnO2 anode and acrylate-based gel polymer electrolyte	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Lithium-ion sulfur polymer battery; Tin oxide; Gel polymer electrolyte; Solid electrolyte interface; In-situ synthesis	PERFORMANCE; SILICON; LITHIATION; COMPOSITE; MICROSCOPY; EFFICIENT; CAPACITY; NANOWIRE; CATHODE; SHEETS	Safety is a prime concern associated with the use of metallic lithium in high-capacity Li-S batteries. Recent studies have shown that replacing lithium metal with other high performance anodes and assembling as lithium-ion sulfur battery (LISB) are effective methods to enhance the safety coefficient of the battery. However, the volume expansion of anodic active materials and gradual thickening of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode, as well as the ever-existing detrimental shuttle effect of sulfur cathode still limit the performance of LISBs. In this work, we propose and prepare a lithium-ion sulfur polymer battery (LISPB) that employs a stable SnO2 anode and a bi-functional gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). We demonstrate that graphene and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) are able to form a robust anode structure and simultaneously maintain a stable SEI in ether-based electrolyte, while the acrylate-based GPE immobilizes the polysulfides and protects the anodic SEI from side deposition reactions. The LISPB renders a superior high rate capability (608.2 mA h g(-1) at 5 C), while maintaining excellent retention at both high and low current densities (83.3% after 300 cycles at 0.3 C and 82.1% after 500 cycles at 1 C). This novel and simple LISPB system represents a significant advancement of high-safety sulfur based batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Liu, M.; Jiang, H. R.; Ren, Y. X.; Zhao, T.

PEEK/CNTs composites were melt mixed in PEEK via two screw extrusion technology. Moreover, the effects of different methods for mixing of PEEK/Wh-CNTs, namely, dry mixing, wet mixing and melt mixing, were compared. The electrical and thermal properties were analyzed. A high thermal conductivity value of about 0.741 W/(m K) could be obtained upon loading with 10 wt% Wh-CNTs and the PEEK/Wh-CNTs composites had low volume resistivity value of 10.96 omega cm at 10 wt% loading via melt mixing. Thermal conductivity values of 1.066 W/(m K) (out-of-plane) and 1.50 W/(m K) (in-plane) were achieved with 10 wt% loading by wet mixing. Experimental results of out-of-plane thermal conductivity were more consistent with the Nan model. PEEK/Wh-CNTs composites prepared by wet mixing exhibited higher thermal conductivity than the composites mixed using the two other methods. As the content of Wh-CNTs in wet mixed PEEK/Wh-CNTs nanocomposites increased, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) was improved. The PEEK/Wh-CNTs composites were 0.6 mm thick and showed an EMI SE of 21.5 dB.

A 4-year-long field experiment established in 2008 was conducted to investigate the effects of the combined return of maize and wheat straw on the SOC stock at a soil depth of 0-20 cm in an intensive summer maize (Zea mays L.)-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system in the Guanzhong Plain. The study involved four treatments with four replicates: low return of maize and wheat straw (ML-WL), low return of maize straw and high return of wheat straw (ML-WH), high return of maize straw and low return of wheat straw (MH-WL), and high return of maize and wheat straw (MH-WH). Compared with the SOC stock in the pre-experimental soil, the SOC stock in the 0-20 cm soil layer decreased by 2.6% under the ML-WL treatment, and in contrast, increased by 1.9% in ML-WH and 14.4% in MH-WH. Similarly, the stabilization rate gradually increased from 2.4% in ML-WH to 10.0% in MH-WH, though an obvious decrease of 6.8% was found in the ML-WL treatment. A significant linear relationship (P < 0.05) was found between SOC sequestration and the cumulative plant derived C input to the soil. A minimum C input of 4.07 Mg ha(-1) year was required to maintain the initial level of SOC. However, a significant relationship (P < 0.05) also existed between the cumulative plant derived C input and non-sequestered C. Moreover, the ranking of the treatments with respect to yield and the sustainable yield index (SYI) of maize and wheat was ML-WL < ML-WH < MH-WL < MH-WH. The average SYI of maize and wheat reached a maximum value of 0.651 when the plant-derived C input was 10.51 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), which was higher than the maximum value (SYI of 0.64, plant-derived C input of 9.76 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) found in the MH-WH treatment. Although the high return of maize and wheat straw was the best treatment in this research, more suitable practices, such wheat straw return including longer stubble or maize straw return in combination with sub-soiling, might increase yield and soil C sequestration, ultimately achieving sustained agricultural development in this cropping system.

The porous structure with adjustable pore size is stacked into a one-dimensional ordered channel through the n n interaction, which provides favorable pathways for rapid charge transport. Terrific structural designability exhibits unique advantages in electrochemical energy storage systems (EESS), such as active site diversity, structural stability, lithium and sulfur affinity, which furnishes a novel perspective for settling various problems of rechargeable batteries.

However, uncontrollable formation of Li dendrite, serious volumetric change, undesirable side reaction and poor mechanical properties of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer impede the commercialization of this technology. By ex-situ observing the initial Li deposition process and conducting electrochemical test, we firstly confirm the prior nucleation behavior of Li metal at the step edge area. We thus employ a balsa wood derived porous carbon matrix as Li host and metal oxide nanoparticles are introduced to increase the nanoscale step amounts for Li nucleation. Hence, the Li nucleation overpotential is reduced and Li can be well accommodated within carbon matrix. Moreover, this step-edge-guided effect could promise the Li striping/plating to happen mainly around the steps area within channels, achieving a dendrite-free anode. Consequently, the modified Li anode is capable of working under an ultrahigh current density of 15 mA cm(-2) with a Coulombic efficiency of similar to 96% and exhibit lower nucleation overpotential, more satisfactory cycling stability. And when in pair with commercial LiCoO2 cathode, it shows better rate performance and higher capacity compared with bare Li foil.

The solvation structure of Li+ and formation of ion pairs in electrolyte solutions composed of triglyme (G3) and a hydrofluoroether (HFE) containing 1 mol dm(-3) Li[TFSA] (TFSA: bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide) were analyzed using pulsed-field gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that Li+ is preferentially solvated by G3 and forms a [Li(G3)](+) complex cation in the electrolytes. The HFE scarcely participates in the solvation because of low donor ability and relatively low permittivity. The dissociativity of Li[TFSA] decreased as the molar ratio of G3/Li[TFSA] in the solution decreased. The activity of G3 in the electrolyte diminishes negligibly as the molar ratio approaches unity because G3 is involved in 1:1 complexation with Li+ ions. The negligible activity of G3 in the electrolyte solutions has significant effects on the electrochemical reactions in lithium batteries. As the activity of G3 diminished, the oxidative stability of the electrolyte was enhanced. The corrosion rate of the Al current collector of the positive electrode was suppressed as the activity of G3 diminished. The high oxidative stability and low corrosion rate of Al in the G3/Li[TFSA] = 1 electrolyte enabled the stable operation of 4-V-class lithium batteries. The activity of G3 also has a significant impact on the Li+ ion intercalation reaction of the graphite electrode. The desolvation of Li+ occurs at the interface of graphite and the electrolyte when the activity of G3 in the electrolyte is significantly low, while the cointercalation of Li+ and G3 takes place in an electrolyte containing excess G3. The activity of G3 influenced the electrochemical reaction process of elemental sulfur in a Li-S battery. The solubility of lithium polysulfides, which are reaction intermediates of the sulfur electrode, decreased as the activity of G3 in the electrolyte decreased. In the G3/Li[TFSA] = 1 electrolyte, the solubility of Li2Sm is very low, and highly efficient charge/discharge of the Li-S battery is possible without severe side reactions.

We summarize and compare carbonate oxygen-isotope records (delta O-18(carb)) from ten lakes within the present-day ISM region. We discuss their paleoclimate significance considering the present-day moisture source, isotopic composition of precipitation and the hydrological setting. The delta O-18(carb) records are controlled mainly by the isotopic composition of lake water, which in turn is a function of regional Precipitation/Evaporation (P/E) balance and the proportion of precipitation that is monsoon-derived. We normalized the delta O-18(carb) data and used these records to generate an integrated moisture index. This index, along with oxygen-isotope records from speleothems and carbon-isotope records (delta C-13(org)) from peats within the monsoon region, suggests that Holocene climate was broadly synchronous across the monsoon region and, within the limits of accuracy of the existing age models, provides no strong evidence for previously-proposed anti-phasing of the ISM and the EASM. Stable-isotope records from lake sediments and peat bogs have excellent potential for providing high-quality paleoclimate data for monsoon Asia, and complement high-resolution speleothem sequences, which are only found in certain localities.

Here we present a facile approach to synthesize Fe3O4@C@CdS magnetic photocatalysts which can avoid multi-step preparation process. Through one-step solvothermal carbonization of ferrocene, the produced carbon-coated Fe3O4 clusters can serve as both magnetic cores and deposition substrates for in situ generating crystalline CdS nanocrystals on them by rapid microwave irradiation. The prepared Fe3O4@C@CdS nanoparticles exhibit a uniform core-shell structure and display good photocatalytic activity and recyclability in the degradation of organic dyes. These magnetic photocatalysts may find potential application in wastewater treatment for the future environment remedy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With these strategies, it is difficult to meet the commercial constraints on Li-ion batteries for plug-in-hybrid and all-electric vehicles as well as those for stationary electrical energy storage (EES) in a grid. Existing alternative strategies include a gaseous O(2) electrode in a Li/air battery and a solid sulfur (S(8)) cathode in a Li/S battery. We compare the projected energy densities and EES efficiencies of these cells with those of a third alternative, a Li/Fe(III)/Fe(II) cell containing a redox couple in an aqueous solution as the cathode. Preliminary measurements indicate proof of concept, but implementation of this strategy requires identification of a suitable Li(+)-ion electrolyte. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, synthesizing high-quality 2D heptazine-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains a formidable challenge, probably due to the scarcity of suitable and ample reactive heptazine-based building blocks. Herein, we designed and synthesized a 4-(methylene diacetate)phenyl-substituted heptazine monomer (HEP-OAc) by oxidation of tris(4-tolyl)heptazine. Accordingly, two highly ordered N-rich COFs (HEP-TAPT-COF and HEP-TAPB-COF) were readily prepared by the direct condensation of HEP-OAc with two C-3-symmetric aromatic amines under solvothermal conditions. In comparison to the pristine g-C3N4, HEP-TAPT-COF exhibited greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance for benzylic C-H oxidation and selective sulfoxidation under mild conditions. This work provides meaningful insights into developing highly crystalline N-rich COFs with better photocatalytic capacities.

Garnet Electrolyte with an Ultralow Interfacial Resistance for Li-Metal Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SOLID-ELECTROLYTE; LITHIUM; CHALLENGES; CONDUCTIVITY; STABILITY; ORIGIN; AL	Garnet-structured Li7La3Zr2O12 is a promising solid Li-ion electrolyte for all-solid-state Li-metal batteries and Li-redox-flow batteries owing to its high Li-ion conductivity at room temperature and good electrochemical stability with Li metal. However, there are still three major challenges unsolved: (1) the controversial electrochemical window of garnet, (2) the impractically large resistance at a garnet/electrode interface and the fast lithium-dendrite growth along the grain boundaries of the garnet pellet, and (3) the fast degradation during storage. We have found that these challenges are closely related to a thick Li2CO3 layer and the Li-Al-O glass phase on the surface of garnet materials. Here we introduce a simple method to remove Li2CO3 and the protons in the garnet framework by reacting garnet with carbon at 700 degrees C; moreover, the amount of the Li-Al-O glass phase with a low Li-ion conductivity in the grain boundary on the garnet surface was also reduced. The surface of the carbon-treated garnet pellets is free of Li2CO3 and is wet by a metallic lithium anode, an organic electrolyte, and a solid composite cathode. The carbon posttreatment has reduced significantly the interfacial resistances to 28, 92 (at 65 degrees C), and 45 Omega cm(2) at Li/garnet, gamet/LiFePO4, and garnet/organic-liquid interfaces, respectively. A symmetric Li/garnet/Li, an all-solid-state Li/garnet/LiFePO4, and a hybrid Li-S cell show small overpotentials, high Coulombic efficiencies, and stable cycling performance.

The terminals and side-walls were linked with oxygen-containing groups when MWCNTs were treated with concentrated acid mixtures. A film of MWCNTs was initially prepared on the platinum electrode surface. Based on the electrostatic interaction between positively charged polyallylamine (PAA) and negatively charged MWCNTs and poly(vinyl sulfate) (PVS), a polymer film of (PVS/PAA)(3) was alternately adsorbed on the modified electrode continuously to be used as a permselective layer. Then poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) and choline oxidase(ChOx) multilayer films were assembled layer-by-layer on the pretreated electrode, so an amplified biosensor toward choline was constructed. The choline sensor showed a linear response range of 5 x 10(-7) to 1 X 10(-4) M With a detection limit of 2 x 10(-7) M estimated at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, and a sensitivity of 12.53 mu A/mM with a response time of 7.6 s in the presence of MWCNTs. Moreover, it exhibited excellent reproducibility, long-term stability as well as good Suppression of interference. This protocol could be used to immobilize other enzymes for biosensor fabrication.

Membrane technologies for water purification are exceptionally attractive due to their high efficiency and low energy consumption. The traditional porous polymer films, however, are easy to be fouled by the organic pollutants, causing pore blockage and deteriorated separation performance. We herein report the rational design of a porous SiO2/GO hybrid membrane by coupling graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets with SiO2 nanoparticles and using ethylenediamine to crosslink them, for efficient oil/water separation and dye removal. The SiO2 nanoparticles provide an excellent hydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity interface, resulting in efficient and antifouling oil/water separation with an outstanding rejection rate over 99.4% for different types of oil; and the hierarchical scaffold, formed from the hydrophilic GO nanosheets embedded with SiO2 nanoparticles, greatly facilitates the rapid permeation of water with a high flux rate of up to 2387 L m(-2) h(-1) for pure water and 470 L m(-2) h(-1) for oil/water separation. Moreover, the abundant functional groups on the GO surface also render this membrane with a high removal capability for dye blocking, enabling it to remove soluble pollutants in molecular dimensions as well. This design strategy not only provides an outstanding membrane for water purification but also sheds light on the design of multi-purpose functional membranes for a variety of energy and environment-related applications.

In this work, the Pb-BiFeO3 photocatalyst was prepared by the hydrothermal method. The effect of doping amount of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on the decomposition of PFOA was investigated under 254 nm UV light. The results indicated that 100 mg L-1 Pb-BiFeO3 with 0.5 wt% rGO exhibited the highest degradation efficiency for 50 mg L-1 PFOA at pH = 2.0 from aqueous solution. The removal rate of PFOA reached 69.6% after 8 h UV irradiation under the optimal conditions (PFOA concentration of 50 mg L-1, Pb- BiFeO3/0.5% rGO concentration of 100 mg L-1, and pH of 2.0). The total organic carbon removal rate and defluorination rate were 28.0% and 37.6%, respectively. During the degradation process, four major intermediates with shorter chain length than PFOA (similar to C4-C7) were identified. The mechanism responsible for PFOA decomposition was supposed that (OH)-O-center dot attacked PFOA to form perfluoroalkyl alcohol and then was transferred to perfluoroalkyl fluoride which can easily undergo hydrolysis to form shorter-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids than PFOA. This indicated that the photo-catalytic degradation of PFOA was an oxidation process through stepwise losing of -CF2 group. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pu, X; Yang, G; Yu, CH				Pu, Xiong; Yang, Gang; Yu, Choongho			Safe and reliable operation of sulfur batteries with lithiated silicon	NANO ENERGY			English	Article						Lithium battery; Sulfur; Silicon; Safety; Reliability	LITHIUM-ION; ANODES; CARBON; INTERLAYER; ENERGY; CELLS	Li-S batteries are very promising due to high energy density and low cost of sulfur compared to the current commercial Li-ion batteries, but they are yet to be viable in practice due to safety hazard and reliability issues. Here we used lithiated Si anode to couple with S, which are the two of the most appealing due to the high energy density but challenging electrode materials for cycling due to volume expansion and polysulfide shuttle. Our LixSi-S (LSS) cells showed stable cycling performance with capacity retention up to 80%, which can be attributed to the use of mesoporous structures in the electrodes. More importantly, the LSS cells were found to be safe and reliable even under two common failure modes, internal and external short-circuit. On the contrary, for Li-S cells, Li dendrites formed during charge made the cell internally short-circuited, and external short-circuit made the cathode powdery.

Thermal stability, tribological and thermomechanical properties of composites were comprehensively investigated. It was demonstrated that g-C3N4 improved elastic deformation resistance and thermal degradation characteristics. The addition of g-C3N4 significantly enhanced anti-wear performance under different loads and speeds. The results indicated that PTFE composites reinforced by g-C3N4 were provided with better properties because the bonding strength of g-C3N4 derived from hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) was stronger than that of MoS2 with van der Waals force. Consequently, g-C3N4 exhibited better thermomechanical and tribological properties. The result of this work is expected to provide a new kind of functional filler for enhancing the tribological properties of polymer composites.

Pure SWCNTs with ultrahigh length-to-diameter ratio and without any functional group were applied to form an interconnect network interlayer via strong pi-pi interactions. Compared to the TFC membrane without SWCNTs interlayer, our TFC membrane with optimal SWCNTs interlayer exhibited more than three times the water permeability (A) of 3.3 L m(-2)h(-1)bar(-1) in RO mode with 500 mg L-1 NaCl as feed solution and nearly three-fold higher FO water flux of 62.8 L m(-2) h(-1) in FO mode with the deionized water as feed solution and 1 M NaCl as draw solution. Meanwhile, the TFC membrane with SWCNTs interlayer exhibited significantly reduced membrane structure parameters (S) to immensely mitigate the effect of internal concentration polarization (ICP) in support layer with micro-sized pores in favor of higher water flux. It showed that the pure SWCNTs interlayer could be an effective strategy to apply in FO membranes.

Herein, through an efficient step-by-step solvothermal synthesis strategy, multi-layered MoO(3)nanosheets are encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) and ultrathin TiO(2)double-shells to obtain hierarchical core-shell nanospheres (MoO3@TiO2@NC). The unique nanostructure enables shortening the Li(+)diffusion distance, buffer the volume change during the intercalation/deintercalation process, and increase the active sites for the electrochemical reaction. Based on the hierarchical nanostructure and the synergistic effect of each component, the MoO3@TiO2@NC electrode exhibits a high Li(+)storage capacity around 979.6 mA h g(-1)after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1), a stable cycle performance of 800.3 mA h g(-1)at 1 A g(-1)after 700 cycles and an excellent rate capability of 418.0 mA h g(-1)at 5 A g(-1). Furthermore, the MoO3@TiO2@NC-based coin-type full cell with a commercial LiNi(1/3)Mn(1/3)Co(1/3)O(2)cathode exhibited a good cycling stability at 0.2 A g(-1)for 100 cycles (similar to 190 mA h g(-1)) and rate capability (134 mA h g(-1)at 5 A g(-1)).

However, it is a great challenge to achieve high-power density and safety lithium-ion batteries due to the lack of reliable separators with uniform porosity, strong mechanical flexibility, and superior electrolyte uptake. Herein, a poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/graphene oxide separator with uniform porosity, strong mechanical flexibility, and superior electrolyte uptake is prepared. The incorporation of graphene oxide into a poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) separator provides a large number of uniform diffusion channels for lithium ions to pass through by reducing the degree of crystallinity and increasing the pore uniformity of separator. In addition, the separator has superior mechanical property and thermal stability in comparison to commercial Celgard 2325 and pure poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) separators. This LiFePO4/Li cell with the prepared poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/graphene oxide separator delivers a high capacity up to 160 mAh g(-1) at 0.5C at room temperature and can be fully charged/discharged in 6 min (10C).

Several variables associated with the reburn system have been investigated in the experiment which includes the air stoichiometry in reburn zone, the location of reburn burner and reburn coal fineness. The optimum location of reburn nozzles has been found where NOx reduction efficiency is highest. With the decrease of reburn coal size (average diameter from 53.69 mu m to 11.47 mu m), NOx reduction efficiency increases slightly, but the burnout performance of coal is improved noticeably. In the process of coal reburning, the temperature of flue gas is 70-90 degrees C lower in primary combustion, but 130-150 degrees C higher at the top of furnace as compared to baseline.

The PPy film was prepared by oxidative electropolymerization to improve the Li/S battery performance, as reported in our previous paper. In such a system, the PPy film was coated directly on the S/Ketjenblack cathode to solve the problem of polysulfide dissolution. The optimum PPy film preparation conditions to prevent polysulfide dissolution and to promote Li+ permeability were determined by varying the PPy polymerization bath composition and polymerization potential. As a result, the inclusion of 1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in the polymerization bath (0.1 M pyrrole in 1-methyl-1-butylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide) was found to be the most important factor for producing a PPy film with a high Li+ transport number (t(Li+) approximate to 1). A polymerization potential of 4.5 V versus Li/Li+ was shown to be optimum for the promotion of Li+ permeability. The mechanism by which the PPy film prevents polysulfide dissolution and increases Li+ permeability is discussed by analyzing the SEM, CV, XPS, and C-13 solid-state NMR data. (C) The Author(s) 2016.

The PdNPs/CMK-3 catalysts were characterized by XRD, N-2 absorption-desorption and TEM analysis. The results showed that the as-prepared PdNPs were of the face-centered cubic structure, P-PdNPs/CMK-3 had an average particle size of 3.4 nm (lower than CMK-3 pore diameter of 3.7 nm), which corresponded to an average diameter of 11.1 nm for AA-PdNPs/CMK-3. The in-situ preparation of P-PdNPs/CMK-3 had a higher dispersion of Pd species and mainly formed inside the pore channels of CMK-3, but distributed on the outer surface of support for AA-PdNPs/CMK-3. The yield reached 95% in the presence of 0.1 mmol% P-PdNPs/CMK-3 at 40 degrees C for 30 min towards the reaction of 4-bromonitrobenzene and phenylboronic acid, which corresponded to 86% for AA-PdNPs/CMK-3. The better stability and recyclability for P-PdNPs/CMK-3 were confirmed by the hot filtration and recycling test. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Herein, aiming to simultaneously reduce the interfacial resistance and to suppress lithium dendrites, we coated lithium metal anodes with two-dimensional (2D) rGO layers prepared via a solvent-evaporation-assisted self-assembly. Upon lithiation/delithiation, the rGO coating cracked into mosaic-like flakes, in between which the interconnected gaps served as the passage for uniform lithium plating/stripping. Half cells composed of a sandwich Cu/Li/rGO electrode vs. Cu foils revealed much improved Li usage and coulombic efficiencies. Through ex situ SEM imaging and XPS depth profiling, a comprehensive view of Li intercalation, deposition, and dendrite suppression on the rGO coating was obtained. As a result of the improved kinetics of Li transportation, excellent electrochemical performances were demonstrated in symmetric gLigLi cells with a stabilized overpotential of only 87.9 mV at 5 mA cm(-2) over 600 cycles, and in Li-S batteries with a stabilized capacity of 1200 mA h g(-1) at 1C near 1000 cycles.

Our experiments demonstrated that nanostructured porous components, such as electrodes and interlayers, generated from the prote-indirected self-assembly of nanoparticles can significantly improve the battery performances. The protein-directed assembly of nanoparticles in solution is a complex process involving the complicated interactions among proteins, particles, and solvent molecules. In this paper, we investigate the effects of coating proteins and specific solvent environments on the assembled porous structures. Comprehensive dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations have been implemented to explore the molecular interactions and uncover the fundamental mechanisms in a gelatin-directed self-assembly of carbon black particles under different solvent conditions. Our simulations show that compact triple-strand "rod-like" structures are formed in water while loose curved "sheet-like" structures are formed in an acetic acid/water mixture. The structural difference is mainly due to the redistribution of the charges on the gelatin side chains under specific acid-solvent conditions. The strong and flexible "sheet-like" structures lead to a homogenous porous structure with high porosity and with large functionalized surfaces. Our simulations results can reasonably explain the experimental observations; this work demonstrates the great potential of DPD as a powerful tool in guiding future experimental design and optimization.

XRD patterns of LCFNb powder sintered in CO2 at 850 degrees C for 10 h indicate that no secondary phases are found during the heat treatment and linear thermal expansion results prove that the LCFNb is compatible with ScSZ electrolyte used in this work. The electrolyser with porous LCFNb membrane cathode fabricated by infiltration method shows impressive electrochemical performance. The current density of 1.97 A/cm(2) at 2.0 Vat 800 degrees C is obtained. The polarization resistance Rp of the SOEC decreases with the increase of the applied voltage between the electrodes. The obtained lowest Rp is as low as 0.113 Omega cm(2) at 2.0 V and this value is much lower than its many other perovskite and nickle-based counterparts. Besides, the LCFNb/ScSZ cathode shows excellent stability in pure CO2 at different applied voltage, especially at 2.0 V. Furthermore, the LCFNb/ScSZ electrode exhibits the current efficiencies close to theoretical ones for CO2 electrolysis, indicating that the LCFNb/ScSZ composite ceramic is an excellent cathode for zirconia-based high temperature electrolyser.

Roll-bonding is an efficient solid-phase joining method for industrial production of bimetallic products. Different from diffusion bonding and friction welding process, the atoms bond and diffuse at interface while the base metal undergoes severe plastic deformation in the process of roll-bonding. In present work, the micro-deformation behavior in the interfacial area of stainless steel/carbon steel during roll-bonding process is studied based on the molecular dynamics method. Firstly, the applicability of the potential function for the bimetallic composite models with different lattice structures was discussed. Then bimetallic model of FeCrNi/Fe and single metal model of FeCrNi, Fe were established. The effect of non-coherent interface on the deformation behavior was revealed by comparing the deformation process of three models. The results show that the mechanical properties and deformation processes of bimetal and single metal are different in the process of deformation bonding. Due to the existence of non-coherent interface, the dislocation in pure Fe matrix is accumulated at the interface during deformation. The local shear effect of interface atoms makes the dislocation formation in FeCrNi matrix easier, thus reducing the yield strength of FeCrNi matrix. The effect of interface on dislocation propagation during alternation makes the dislocation density change alternately in the two matrixes, which improves the ability of material to resist plastic deformation. In addition, the alternately change of the dislocation density within the two matrixes during the deformation process leads to the special phenomenon that the deformation of the two matrixes is alternately changed.

The mixing ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its influencing factors in urban Nanjing were investigated in this study, from the 18th of January to the 31st of December 2011. The annual average mixing ratio of CO2 was 406.5 +/- 20.0 ppmv over the study period. The signal analysis using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm showed that CO2 had different cycles as a result of multiple controlling factors. The seasonal and intra-seasonal fluctuations of CO2 were mainly caused by the terrestrial biospheric uptake and emission and atmospheric oscillation. The weekly variation of CO2 was largely influenced by traffic volume. The diurnal cycle of CO2 presented a bimodal pattern in winter (DJF) probably due to the rush hour emissions. The seasonal mean CO2/CO correlation slope varied from 0.024 ppMv/ppbv to 0.029 ppmv/Ppbv, comparable to the fossil fuel combustion emission ratio. The diurnal pattern of CO2/CO was irregular, indicating random anthropogenic emissions in an urban area. Firework setting was a large source of CO2 during the Spring Festival holiday. The backward trajectories by the HYSPLIT model showed that the local anthropogenic emissions contributed the most to the high CO2 mixing ratio in the urban area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The results reveal that the deformation temperature has a beneficial effect on the bonding rate, and that the critical temperature for the large-area bonding of stainless steel and carbon steel is approximately 700 degrees C. However, owing to the short contact time, only a shallow diffusion of approximately 2-3 mu m can be achieved. A slight decrease in the interfacial bonding rate after heat preservation is correlated to the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the two materials, but the thickness of the diffusion layer shows a significant increase. It was found that the strength of the composites is mostly related to the bonding rate and the strength of the relatively soft material, which can be determined using an explicit equation. Moreover, with the increase in the interfacial bonding rate, the crack source changes from the junction of the unbonded and bonded areas of the interface to the interior of the carbon steel. The failure mode evolves from cleavage brittle fracture to ductile-brittle mixed-mode fracture, and then to ductile fracture.

J	Li, FP; Liu, LS; Yang, ZM; Li, S				Li, Faping; Liu, Lisheng; Yang, Zheming; Li, Shan			Influence of modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes on the mechanical behavior and toughening mechanism of an environmentally friendly granulated blast furnace slag-based geopolymer matrix	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Geopolymer; Mechanical strength; Porosity; XRD; FT-IR	STRENGTH; MORTAR; ALKALI; MICROSTRUCTURE; DISPERSIONS; PASTE	This study aimed to investigate the mechanical behavior of an environmentally friendly granulated blast furnace slag-based geopolymer matrix reinforced with modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The modi-fied MWCNTs were obtained using a modification method combining nitric acid and sulfuric acid and were then dispersed using sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) as a dispersant. Two types and three concentrations of MWCNTs were mixed directly into the aqueous solution, sonicated, and then mechanically mixed with waste granulated blast furnace slag to form the geopolymer matrix. Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy were used to evaluate the ordered structure and crystallization degree of the modified MWCNTs. Then, the dispersity of the modified MWCNTs was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The compressive and bending strengths were measured to evaluate the mechanical behavior of specimens. Moreover, the polycondensation products, polycondensation degree, pore structure, and microscopic morphology of the geopolymer matrix were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDS). The experimental results showed that the incorporation of 0.1% functionalized MWCNTs had an optimal influence on the fluidity and mechanical behavior. The slump diameters of geopolymers with 0.1% functionalized MWCNTs with and without SDS were increased by 16.3% and 23.5%, respectively, compared with the reference geopolymer matrix. For geopolymer matrix samples at a curing age of 28 d, the compressive strength of geopolymers with 0.1% functionalized MWCNTs with and without SDS were increased by 16.3% and 17.6%, respectively. For the bending strength, the corresponding increases were 17.6% and 18.7%, respectively. It was found that functionalized MWCNTs could increase the degree of poly condensation, leading to a more traditional amorphous N-A-S-H phase, a finer C-S-H phase, more Q(4) (2Al) and Q(4) (3Al), and lower porosity. In addition, the propagation of micro-cracks in the geopolymers was inhibited by the incorporation of functionalized MWCNTs.

Liquid lithium iodide (LiI) electrolyte and solid sulfur/carbon (S/C) composite, forming LiI-S/C MRSSL catholyte, are employed to demonstrate this concept. Record volumetric capacity (550 Ah L-1 catholyte) is achieved using highly concentrated and synergistic multiple redox reactions of LiI and sulfur. The liquid LiI electrolyte is found to increase the reversible volumetric capacity of the catholyte, improve the electrochemical utilization of the S/C composite, and reduce the viscosity of catholyte. A continuous flow test is demonstrated and the influence of the flow rate on the flow battery performance is discussed. The MRSSL flow battery concept transforms inactive component into bi-functional active species and creates synergistic interactions between multiple redox couples, offering a new direction and wide-open opportunities to develop high-energy-density flow batteries.

Electrodes are manufactured using an aqueous binder, namely lithiated Poly(acrylic acid). High mass loading electrodes having areal capacities of over 3 mAh/cm(2) are obtained. The electrochemical behavior of the anodes is evaluated by means of galvanostatic cycling, differential capacities analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is found that the anodes show very good electrochemical performance not only in standard electrolytes based on carbonates solvents but also in electrolytes containing ethers, which are commonly used in Li-S batteries. Furthermore a viable approach for eliminating the irreversible capacity loss at the first cycle using Stabilized Lithium Metal Powder (SLMP) is reported. Finally we introduce a new parameter, namely efficient capacity (C-eff), which is used to estimate the benefits achievable through the utilization of silicon containing anodes over state-of-the-art graphite ones.

In the asymptotic limit of large nuclear charge Z, we determine explicitly the low-lying energy levels and eigenstates. The asymptotic energies and wavefunctions are in good quantitative agreement with experimental data for positive ions, and in excellent qualitative agreement even for neutral atoms (Z = N). In particular, the predicted ground state spin and angular momentum quantum numbers (S-1 for He, Be, Ne, S-2 for H and Li, S-4 for N, P-2 for B and F, and P-3 for C and O) agree with experiment in every case. The asymptotic Schrodinger ground states agree, up to small corrections, with the semiempirical hydrogen orbital configurations developed by Bohr, Hund, and Slater to explain the periodic table. In rare cases where our results deviate from this picture, such as the ordering of the lowest D-1(o) and S-3(o) states of the carbon isoelectronic sequence, experiment confirms our predictions and not Hund's.

Herein, we fabricate a 3D lithiophilic and conductive N-CNT@Cu2O@Cu framework to suppress Li dendrites for the first time. It is a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) network with core-shell Cu2O@Cu. N-CNTs and Cu2O are lithiophilic for Li nucleation. CNTs and Cu nanoparticles on Cu2O constitute a conductive framework to effectively transfer electrons and Li+ and reduce local current density. Moreover, Cu2O@Cu serves as a concentrator to attract Li+ and connect several N-CNT fibers for effective current transmission. This structure proves to have an eminent synergistic effect in suppressing dendrites, which shows excellent electrochemical performance: a high CE of about 97% even after 1100 cycles with the Li-S electrolyte, which exceeds that of almost all published works to inhibit Li dendrites. It also exhibits impressive electrochemical performance in symmetric and full cells. It would shed light on the research of impeding dendrites and prospering the development of alkali-metal batteries.

The experimental program consists of preparing and testing eight samples, two control, and six strengthened samples. The main variables of the experiment are the strengthening layout and the cross-sectional area of CFRP bars. The results show that NSM strengthening increases the ultimate load by up to 44%. The strengthening delays the formation of the first crack in concrete, thus maintaining a linear behavior for load-displacement and load-strain curves for a higher level of load. The NSM strengthening increases the flexural stiffness by over 100% and maintains a strong bond with concrete throughout the loading. The flexural strength of the slab increases, which subsequently improves the punching shear capacity. The experimental results are compared with several design codes by modification and implementation of Chen and Li's method. There is a good agreement between the calculated ultimate capacity of the strengthened samples and the obtained experimental results.

In this work, we attempted to chemically manipulate the interfacial microstructure of oil-water microemulsions (ME) with carbon dots (CDs), concentrating on substantially enhancing the antioxidant capacity of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). To this end, CDs were synthesized and introduced into an ME. The molecular interaction of surfactant with CDs was investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The microstructure of the ME was monitored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The cryo-EM result showed the oil-water interface in the ME was better defined after the CDs were loaded, and H-1 NMR proved the CDs were distributed mainly at the interface. On the basis of these results, interfacial models were proposed. Final evaluation results demonstrated the stabilizing effect and oxidation-inhibition ability of the ALA-loaded ME was substantially enhanced after the introduction of the CDs, indicating a "turn off" effect of the interface. Interestingly, CDs do not affect the in vitro release of ALA, indicating a "turn on" effect of the interface. This work provided a successful interface manipulation with a nanocarrier that can be used for a large diversity of food nutraceuticals.

Here, we demonstrate that the single-atom Zn sites can drive the high dimensional Li deposition kinetics without dendrite. Theoretical calculation predicts the higher surface binding energy and lower migration barrier, providing the possibility toward high dimensional Li deposition. Chronoamperometry investigation on Li deposition reveals the facilitated instantaneous nucleation behavior. Electron microscopy and in situ optical microscopy further identify the high dimensional Li deposition without dendrite-forming. Benefiting from the improved deposition kinetics, Li deposition and stripping performances on ZnSAs achieve low overpotential about 12 mV and high Coulombic efficiency reaching to 100%. Discharging-charging of symmetrical Li-ZnSAs vertical bar Li-ZnSAs cell cycles over 800 h with steady voltage oscillations. The Li-ZnSAs anode applying on Li-S and Li-O-2 batteries can still present stable performance. This work provides a new insight into fundamental understanding of electrochemical deposition of metal anodes by driving high dimensional deposition kinetics using single-atom sites.

In this study, filter-based PM2.5 samples were collected during November-December 2013 at four sites in Guangzhou, and the major components were fast screened (similar to 7 min per filter sample) by Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR)-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopic (FTIR) in comparisonwith thatmeasured by Organic carbon/Element carbon (OC/EC) analyzer and Ion Chromatography (IC). The concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, sulfate, primary organic carbon (POC) and secondary organic carbon (SOC) measured by OC/EC and IC analyzers were better correlated with their infrared absorption peak heights at 1320 cm(-1) for nitrate, 1435, 3045 and 3215 cm(-1) for ammonium, 615 cm-1 for sulfate, 690, 760 and 890 cm(-1) for POC and 1640 and 1660 cm-1 for SOC respectively, during polluted days (PM2.5 > 75 mu g/m(3)) than during clean days (PM2.5 <= 75 mu g/m(3)). With the evolution of a haze episode during our field campaign, the concentrations of the major PM2.5 components displayed consistent variations with their infrared absorption peak heights, suggesting ATR-FTIR could be a fast and useful technique to characterize filter-based PM2.5 compositions particularly during pollution events although cautions should be taken when PM2.5 levels are low. Notably, elevated PM2.5 mass concentrations occurred with enhanced ratios of [NO3-]/[SO42-] and [NH4+]/[SO42-], implying that nitrogenous components play vital roles in the PM2.5 pollution events in the study region.

However, the activities and efficiencies of the transition metal-based nanoparticles or single-atom sites are still ambiguous in Fenton-like reactions. Herein, to compare the Fenton-like catalytic efficiencies of the nanoparticles and single atoms, the free-standing nanofibrous catalyst comprising Co nanocrystals and Co-N-x codoped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or bare Co-N-x doped CNTs is fabricated. It is noteworthy that all these nanofibrous catalysts exhibit efficient activities, mesoporous structures, and conductive carbon networks, which allow a feasible validation of the catalytic effects. Benefiting from the maximized atomic utilization, the atomic Co-N-x centers exhibit much higher reaction kinetic constant (kappa = 0.157 min(-1)) and mass activity toward the degradation of bisphenol A, far exceeding the Co nanocrystals (kappa = 0.082 min(-1)). However, for the volume activities, the single-atom catalyst does not show apparent advantages compared to the nanocrystal-based catalyst. Overall, this work not only provides a viable pathway for comparing Fenton-like catalytic effects of transition metal-based nanoparticles or single atoms but also opens up a new avenue for developing prominent catalysts for organic pollutants' degradation.

A modified optimal stomatal conductance model under water-stressed condition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION			English	Article						Optimal stomatal regulation; Marginal water cost of carbon gain; Soil water content; Jarvis; BBL	GAS-EXCHANGE; USE EFFICIENCY; EUCALYPTUS-GLOBULUS; SURFACE CONDUCTANCE; OPTIMIZATION THEORY; NET PHOTOSYNTHESIS; LEAF CONDUCTANCE; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; FOREST; TRANSPIRATION	Accurate estimation of leaf stomatal conductance (g(s)) is important in predicting carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystem. To estimate g(s) on field-grown soybean and maize under water-stressed condition accurately, a modified optimal stomatal conductance (OSCM) model was established based on the relationship between marginal water cost of carbon gain and soil water content by introducing a water stress factor (f(theta(v))). f(theta(v)) had same form with that in Jarvis and Ball-Berry-Leuning (BBL) models. The OSCM model was evaluated and compared with the original optimal stomatal conductance (OSC), Jarvis and BBL models by comparing observed and estimated gs of three-year data on soybean and four-year data on maize in an arid region of northwest China. Results show that the OSCM and OSC models were more steady and accurate than the Jarvis and BBL models for estimating gs on soybean and maize at the different years. Moreover, the OSCM model performed better than the OSC model because of considering the effect of water stress. Compared with the OSC, Jarvis and BBL models, the OSCM model improved the accuracy of estimating gs on soybean and maize on average by 7%, 25% and 35% and reduced the RMSE by 19%, 56% and 43%, respectively. As for estimating diurnal change of g(s) on soybean and maize under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions, the OSCM model also performed better than the OSC, Jarvis and BBL models. Under water-stressed condition, only the OSCM model is recommended due to its high accuracy, conservative and accessible parameter, which can provide a more accurate and convenient tool in predicting water and carbon fluxes of terrestrial ecosystem in the arid area.

Incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into CuO anodes with conventional methods fails to build robust interaction between rGO and CuO to efficiently improve the overall anode performance. Here, Cu2O/CuO/reduced graphene oxides (Cu2O/CuO/rGO) with a 3D hierarchical nanostructure are synthesized with a facile, single-step hydrothermal method. The Cu2O/CuO/rGO anode exhibits remarkable cyclic and high-rate performances, and particularly the anode with 25 wt% rGO owns the best performance among all samples, delivering a record capacity of 550 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C after 100 cycles. The pronounced performances are attributed to the highly efficient charge transfer in CuO nanosheets encapsulated in rGO network and the mitigated volume expansion of the anode owing to its robust 3D hierarchical nanostructure.

For Li-S batteries that hold the promise for outperforming the current generation of Li ion batteries, the interactions of lithium polysulfide (LPS) intermediates with the electrode surface strongly influence the efficiency and cycle life of the sulfur cathode. While metal oxides have been demonstrated to be useful in trapping LPS, the actual binding modes of LPS on 3d transition metal oxides and their dependence on the metal element identity across the periodic table remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the chemical interactions between LPS and oxides of Mn, Fe, Co, and Cu by combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. We find that Li-O interactions dominate LPS binding to the oxides (Mn3O4, Fe2O3, and Co3O4), with increasing strength from Mn to Fe to Co. For Co3O4, LPS binding also involves metal-sulfur interactions. We also find that the metal oxides exhibit different binding preferences for different LPS, with Co3O4 binding shorter-chain LPS more strongly than Mn3O4. In contrast to the other oxides, CuO undergoes intense reduction and dissolution reactions upon interaction with LPS. The reported findings are thus particularly relevant to the design of LPS/oxide interfaces for high-performance Li-S batteries.

Herein, these issues are applied to a conversion-type zinc-tellurium (Zn-Te) battery. Typically, this battery works based on a two-step solid-to-solid conversion with the successive formation of zinc ditelluride (ZnTe2) and zinc telluride (ZnTe). It delivers an ultrahigh volumetric capacity of 2619 mAh cm(-3)(419 mAh g(-1)), 74.1% of which is from the first conversion (Te to ZnTe2) with an ultraflat discharge plateau. Though reported first in a challenging aqueous environment, this Zn-Te battery demonstrates an excellent capacity retention of >82.8% after 500 cycles, which results from the elimination of the notorious "shuttle effect" due to the solid-to-solid conversion behaviors. In addition, a quasi-solid-state Zn-Te battery is also fabricated, exhibiting superior flexibility, robustness, and good electrochemical performance.

Thus, it is necessary to disperse CNFs for use in materials. In this study, three types of surfactants used in distilled water and seawater were investigated. To obtain the optimal dispersion conditions, the effects of different types and concentrations of surfactants and ultrasonic treatment times on the dispersion of CNFs were investigated quantitatively. The CNF suspensions were studied via visual examination, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The compressive strength, tensile strength, and porosity were examined to evaluate the mechanical properties of CNF-modified early strength seawater seasand engineered cementitious composites (SS-ECCs). Moreover, field-emission electron Scanning microscopy (SEM) was used to study their microstructures. After dispersion with surfactants and ultrasonication, individual fibres were found in the suspension. Seawater adversely affected the stability of the suspensions. Well-dispersed CNFs improved the mechanical properties of the cementitious composites, with an increase in compressive and tensile strengths of 21-24% and 16-20%, respectively. The tensile strain capacity increased by approximately twofold. The porosity was reduced and the pores structure was refined. Microscopic examination proved that CNFs were also well dispersed in cement matrix. The results showed that the addition of CNFs could significantly improve the mechanical properties of cement-based composites.

However, its practical applicability has remained low owing to its difficult of preparation, large volume expansion during cycling, and poor electronic conductivity. To this end, there have been significant efforts to improve its synthesis methods and electrochemical performance. A number of black-phosphorus-based composite materials have been developed and investigated. Herein, we provide an up-to-date account of the recent progress made in research on black-phosphorus-based materials for use in rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. We review the available synthesis methods and basic properties of black phosphorus and discuss its applicability in Li-, Na-, K-, Mg-, Al-ion and Li-S batteries as well as supercapacitors. We also summarize the existing challenges and future opportunities and offer our perspective on the possible directions for future research in this area.

Four types of AAILs, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium glycine ([EMIM][GLY]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium serine ([EMIM][SER]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium valine ([EMIM][VAL]) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium phenylalanine ([EMIM][PHE]), with different amino acid anions were selected as electrolytes for supercapacitors. The number density profiles and ion orientation at varying surface charge densities were delineated to exploit the microstructure of EDLs for different AAILs. As a result, similar EDL structures of cations near a negative graphene electrode were observed, whereas the EDLs at positively charged electrodes displayed dependence on amino acid anions. AAILs composed of the common cation [EMIM](+) and dissimilar amino acid anions exhibit similar differential capacitance-electrical potential (C-V) curves and comparable capacitance to conventional ionic liquids.

J	Lee, JA; Ahn, JH; Kim, I; Li, S; Lee, SY				Lee, Jong An; Ahn, Jung Ho; Kim, Inho; Li, Sheng; Lee, Sang Yup			Separation and purification of three, four, and five carbon diamines from fermentation broth	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						1,3-diaminopropane; 1,4-diaminobutane; 1,5-diaminopentane; Purification; Fermentation broth	BIO-BASED PRODUCTION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SUCCINIC ACID; EXTRACTION; POLYMERS; REMOVAL	1,3-diaminopropane (1,3-DAP), 1,4-diaminobutane (1,4-DAB), and 1,5-diaminopentane (1,5-DAP) are important chemicals due to their wide industrial use including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, and building blocks for nylon synthesis. Over the last decade, several studies on bio-based production of diamines by metabolically engineered microorganisms have been published. However, development of efficient methods for the recovery of 1,3-DAP, 1,4-DAB, and 1,5-DAP from fermentation broth has not been reported. In this study, an efficient process for the separation and purification of 1,3-DAP, 1,4-DAB, and 1,5-DAP from fermentation broth without using highly flammable or toxic solvents was developed. The optimal process for the recovery and purification of these diamines from fermentation broth comprises several unit operations including removal of cell debris, decolorization of fermentation broth, product concentration, deprotonation of diamines, product separation, and final polishing to obtain pure 1,3-DAP, 1,4-DAB, and 1,5-DAP with yields of 87 +/- 3%, 86 +/- 4%, and 81 +/- 2%, respectively. Process development for the recovery and purification of fermentatively produced diamines reported here is expected to facilitate synthesis of bio-based nylons. Furthermore, the strategy reported here could be similarly applicable in developing downstream processes to recover and purify other diamines and related chemicals from fermentation broth.

The structural and morphological analyses of the ZnS-TiC-C nanocomposites reveal that ZnS and TiC nanocrystallites are homogeneously distributed in an amorphous carbon matrix. Compared with ZnS-C and ZnS composites, the ZnS-TiC-C nanocomposite exhibits significantly improved electrochemical performance, delivering a highly reversible specific capacity (613 mA h g(-1) over 600 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1), i.e., similar to 85% capacity retention), excellent long-term cyclic performance (545 mA h g(-1) and 467 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and 1 A g(-1), respectively, after 600 cycles), and good rate capability at 10 A g(-1) (69% capacity retention at 0.1 A g(-1)). The electrochemical performance is significantly improved, primarily owing to the presence of conductive hybrid matrix of titanium carbide and amorphous carbon in the ZnS-TiC-C nanocomposites. The matrix not only provides high conductivity but also acts as a mechanical buffering matrix preventing huge volume changes during prolonged cycling. The lithiation/delithiation mechanisms of the ZnS-TiC-C electrodes are examined via ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Furthermore, to investigate the practical application of the ZnS-TiC-C nanocomposite, a coin-type full cell consisting of a ZnS-TiC-C anode and a LiFePO4-graphite cathode is assembled and characterized. The cell exhibits excellent cyclic stability up to 200 cycles and a good rate performance. This study clearly demonstrates that the ZnS-TiC-C nanocomposite can be a promising negative electrode material for the next-generation lithium-ion batteries.

Tailoring the Load Carrying Capacity of MWCNTs Through Inter-shell Atomic Bridging	EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS			English	Article						Carbon nanotube; Molecular dynamics; Tensile test; Irradiation; Crosslinking; Strengthening		Recent studies have finally produced accurate measurements of the mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, confirming the anticipated results computed from quantum and molecular mechanics. Several studies have also predicted an enhancement of these material properties as a result of electron irradiation. Here we prove conclusively through a rigorous TEM imaging study that this enhancement occurs as a result of multiple-shell load transfer through irradiation-induced crosslinks. Using a computational model of the system which mirrors the experimental setup, we show that intershell covalent crosslinks resulting from the irradiation are efficient atomic structures for inter-shell load transfer. A study of the correlation between number of defects and load transfer provides insight into the experimental results and quantifies the increase in load transfer with radiation dose. The combined experimental/computational approach therefore gives a complete understanding of the phenomenon and provides the means for tailoring the mechanical properties of 1-D nanostructures.

J	ANDERSON, AB; MEHANDRU, SP				ANDERSON, AB; MEHANDRU, SP			N-TYPE DOPANTS AND CONDUCTION-BAND ELECTRONS IN DIAMOND - CLUSTER MOLECULAR-ORBITAL THEORY	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							FILMS	A molecular-orbital study has been made of substitutional (s) atomic Li, N, and P and interstitial (i) Li in diamond through the use of cluster models of the diamond lattice. The small binding energy calculated for P(s) indicates extremely small solubility for P in the lattice. Calculated electronic structures, including lattice relaxations, show Li(s) is an acceptor and P(s) is a donor that should fully ionize in bulk diamond. Li(i) is either a shallow donor or fully ionized. N(s) is a deep donor and its thermal excitation energy is significantly lower than the optical energy because of stabilization from relaxation around N+. In clusters of the size studied, with up to 98 carbon atoms, conduction-band electrons become trapped in donor C-C bond stretch regions, occupying a C-C sigma* orbital. Electron transport in such clusters would be activated by polaron hopping, with local lattice distortions around the localized electron orbital. In the bulk limit this donor level will be stablized slightly but the bottom of the conduction band lowers to the point that free-electron transport should take over.

As one type of structure, honeycomb monoliths having microscopically dimensioned channels have recently gained many achievements since their emergence. Inspired by the microhoneycomb structure that occurs in natural tree xylems, we have been focusing on the assembly of such a structure by using the major component in tree xylem, cellulose, as the starting material. Through the path that finally led us to the successful reconstruction of tree xylems by the unidirectional freeze-drying (UDF) approach, we verified the function of cellulose nanofibers, toward forming xylem-like monoliths (XMs). The strong tendency of cellulose nanofibers to form XMs through the UDF approach was extensively confirmed with surface grafting or a combination of a variety of second components (or even a third component). The resulting composite XMs were thus imparted with extra properties, which extends the versatility of this kind of material. Particularly, we demonstrated in this paper that XMs containing reduced graphene oxide (denoted as XM/rGO) could be used as strain sensors, taking advantage of their penetrating microchannels and the bulk elasticity property. Our methodology is flexible in its processing and could be utilized to prepare various functional composite XMs.	[Pan, Zheng-Ze; Kang, Feiyu; Yang, Quan-Hong] Tsinghua Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Engn Lab Functionalized Carbon Mat, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Pan, Zheng-Ze; Kang, Feiyu; Yang, Quan-Hong] Tsinghua Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Shenzhen Key Lab Graphene Based Mat, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Pan, Zheng-Ze; Nishihara, Hirotomo; Iwamura, Shinichiroh; Kyotani, Takashi] Tohoku Univ, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Adv Mat, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Nishihara, Hirotomo] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, PRESTO, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Iwamura, Shinichiroh] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Chem Proc Engn, Kita Ku, N13W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Sekiguchi, Takafumi; Sato, Akihiro] Seiko PMC Corp, Midori Ku, 2-3-37 Ohno Dai, Chiba, Chiba 2670056, Japan; [Isogai, Akira] Univ Tokyo, Dept Biomat Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Kang, Feiyu; Yang, Quan-Hong] Tsinghua Univ, TBSI, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Yang, Quan-Hong] Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China		Yang, QH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Engn Lab Functionalized Carbon Mat, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.; Yang, QH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Grad Sch Shenzhen, Shenzhen Key Lab Graphene Based Mat, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.; Nishihara, H (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Inst Multidisciplinary Res Adv Mat, Aoba Ku, 2-1-1 Katahira, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.; Nishihara, H (corresponding author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, PRESTO, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan.; Yang, QH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, TBSI, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.; Yang, QH (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.	nisihara@tagen.tohoku.ac.jp; yang.quanhong@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn	Pan, Zheng-Ze/T-7194-2019; Nishihara, Hirotomo/I-6057-2019; Iwamura, Shinichiroh/P-9747-2019; Isogai, Akira/O-8897-2017; Yang, Quan-Hong/Y-6091-2019	Pan, Zheng-Ze/0000-0001-7021-6147; Nishihara, Hirotomo/0000-0003-4497-4248; Iwamura, Shinichiroh/0000-0001-8827-8880; Isogai, Akira/0000-0001-8095-0441; Ai, Lingqin/0000-0002-4967-6816; Kang, Feiyu/0000-0002-3704-4379	Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [2206, 25107705]; JSPS KAKENHI Grant [15K14140]; JST PREST; Dynamic Alliance for Open Innovation Bridging Human, Environment and Materials; Chinese National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [51525204]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1401243, 51372167]	Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JST PREST; Dynamic Alliance for Open Innovation Bridging Human, Environment and Materials; Chinese National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This work was supported partly by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on the Innovative Areas: "Fusion Materials" (Area No. 2206), 25107705 and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15K14140, by JST PREST, and also by Dynamic Alliance for Open Innovation Bridging Human, Environment and Materials.

Still, studies on the inter-annual variation in atmospheric BC over the TP and associated variation in BC sources and controlling factors are rather limited. In this study, we characterize the variations in atmospheric BC over the TP surface layer through analysis of 20-year (1995-2014) simulations from a global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. The results show that surface BC concentrations over the TP vary largely in space and by season, reflecting complicated interplays of BC sources from different origins. Of all areas in the TP, surface BC concentrations are highest over the eastern and southern TP, where surface BC is susceptible to BC transport from East Asia and South Asia, respectively. Applying a backward-trajectory method that combines BC concentrations from GEOS-Chem and trajectories from the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, we assess the contributions of worldwide source regions to surface BC in the TP. We estimate that on the 20-year average, 77% of surface BC in the TP comes from South Asia (43 %) and East Asia (35 %). Regarding seasonal variation in non-local influences, South Asia and East Asia are dominant source regions in winter and summer, respectively, in terms of the amount of BC imported. However, in terms of affected areas in the TP, South Asia is the dominant contributor throughout the year. Inter-annually, surface BC over the TP is largely modulated by atmospheric transport of BC from non-local regions year-round and by biomass burning in South Asia, mostly in spring. We find that the extremely strong biomass burning in South Asia in the spring of 1999 greatly enhanced surface BC concentrations in the TP (31% relative to the climatology). We find that the strength of the Asian monsoon correlates significantly with the inter-annual variation in the amount of BC transported to the TP from non-local regions. In summer, a stronger East Asian summer monsoon and a stronger South Asian summer monsoon tend to, respectively, lead to more BC transport from central China and north-eastern South Asia to the TP. In winter, BC transport from central China is enhanced in years with a strong East Asian winter monsoon or a strong Siberian High. A stronger Siberian High can also bring more BC from northern South Asia to the TP. This study underscores the impacts of atmospheric transport and biomass burning on the inter-annual variation in surface BC over the TP. It reveals a close connection between the Asian monsoon and atmospheric transport of BC from non-local regions to the TP.

To promote the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, a class of heterojunction photocatalysts, perovskite-type sodium niobate (NaNbO3) nanorods modified g-C3N4 (SNCN), was fabricated through a two-step hydrothermal and thermal polymerization method in this study. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated the successful decoration of NaNbO3 onto g-C3N4, as well as the formation of material interface with high reactivity. The optimal material (SNCN-3) exhibited an extremely high degradation efficiency of ofloxacin (OFL) under simulated solar light, as the kinetic rate constant (k) was 29.6 and 10.4 times of that for the neat g-C3N4 and NaNbO3, respectively. Energy band structure analysis indicated that SNCN-3 was a type II heterojunction. Moreover, surface photovoltage (SPV), photoluminescence (PL) and transient photocurrent response measurements confirmed SNCN-3 had the highest electron-hole separation efficiency compared with NaNbO3, g-C3N4 and the other SNCN composites. Quenching tests indicated that O-center dot(2)- and holes were the primary reactive species for OFL degradation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation on further revealed the atoms of OFL with high Fukui index (f(0)) preferred to be attacked by the produced radicals. Cleavage of piperazine moiety and substitution of F were the key OFL degradation pathways. In addition, the reduced toxicity of transformation products after photocatalysis verified the proposed technique was a green method. This work provided the promising application of g-C3N4/NaNbO3 heterojunction photocatalysts for degradation of antibiotic pollutants in water.

The researchers investigated the microstructure and the wear resistance of the as-obtained coating. Results showed that the as-received coating was of 7.5 +/- 0.3 mu m with surface micro-hardness of approximately 1885 +/- 121 HV0.025. The coating presented excellent adhesion to the substrate as evidenced by a bonding force between the coating (carbide layer) and substrate of approximately 52 N. During the sliding test, its friction coefficient (0.45-0.56) tended to decrease in the final stage. In comparison with the bare substrate, the specific wear volume loss for the titanium carbide-coated specimen decreased by 78%.

Five polysaccharides: xanthan gum, guar gum, fenugreek gum, welan gum and chitosan were screened for plant growth promoting effect. The results showed that welan gum had the most significant effect on promoting the growth of rice seedlings, and the concentrations of 0.1 mg mL(-1) and 0.15 mg mL(-1) showed the best growth effects. The effects of welan gum on nitrogen utilization in rice seedlings were investigated. Results showed welan gum increased the contents of ammonium, nitrate, free amino acids, and proteins in rice seedlings. There were four key enzymes of nitrogen metabolism which are nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase, and glutamate dehydrogenase significantly enhanced by welan gum though up-regulating the transcriptional levels of these enzymes. Therefore, nitrogen uptake and nitrogen metabolism in rice seedlings were promoted to increase the biomass of rice seedlings. Based on the research, results showed that welan gum could constitute a promising fertilizer in the future.

To investigate the reason of this fading at low temperature from Li+ storage mechanism perspective, three different carbon structures with various amounts of defect and interlayer spacing are employed in this work, including natural graphite, hard carbon (HC) and mesocarbon microbead (MCMB). The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests indicate that amorphous HC electrode shows higher lithiation capacity than graphite and MCMB electrode at -20 degrees C. Cyclic voltammetry tests reveal that higher lithiation capacity of HC electrode mainly stems from the surface-induced capacitive storage mechanism. This work confirms that the utilization of surface-induced capacitive storage mechanism could be considered as a promising strategy to improve the low temperature electrochemical performance.

The PAN-derived carbon matrix could effectively confine the small Se molecules and provide a sufficient buffer for the volume changes. The reversible formation of small-molecule trigonal Se (Se-1, P3(1)21) phase could essentially inhibit the formation of polyselenides and account for outstanding electrochemical performance. The carbonate-based electrolyte further synergistically diminishes the shuttle effect by inhibiting the formation of polyselenides in the meantime. The as-prepared K-Se battery shows a reversible capacity of 1904 mAh cm(-3) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and rate retention of 89% from 0.1 to 2 C. In addition, the charge-discharge mechanism is also investigated via the combination of in-situ and ex-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy analysis. The results reveal that the introduction of K+ ions leads to the cleavage of C-Se bonds, the rearrangement of selenium atoms, and the final formation of the main product K2Se. Moreover, the reversible formation of trigonal Se (Se-1, P3(1)21) phase was detected in the reaction with K+. These findings not only can advance our understanding of this family of batteries, but also provide insight into chemically-bonded selenium composite electrodes, which could give guidance for scientific research and the optimization of Se and S electrodes for the K-S, Na-S, Li-S, Na-Se, and Li-Se batteries.

J	Sun, K; Wu, Q; Gan, H				Sun, Ke; Wu, Qin; Gan, Hong			Molecular insights into ether-based electrolytes for Li-FeS2 batteries	ENERGY STORAGE MATERIALS			English	Article						Pyrite; Polysulfide solubility; Electrolyte; Methyl t-Butyl ether; Solvation modeling	LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; PYRITE FES2 NANOCRYSTALS; RECHARGEABLE LITHIUM; CATHODE MATERIAL; ELECTROCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; PERFORMANCE	Lithium-FeS2 is an attractive chemistry for rechargeable lithium batteries because of its high theoretical energy density similar to 1313 Wh kg(-1). However, fast capacity fade is generally observed in this system due to the irreversible dissolution of active materials (polysulfide ions, Fe ion etc.) into the electrolyte. This work investigates the effect of ethereal electrolyte solvents' structure on its solvating power of Li-polysulfides and eventually on the cycling stability of rechargeable Li-FeS2 cells. Methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), a high carbon/oxygen ratio ether, is studied and compared with the standard 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME):1,3-dioxolane (DOL) ether couple as electrolyte solvent for Li-FeS2 and similar chemistries. The higher level of non-polar character and the additional steric hindrance in MTBE both endow it with significantly lower solvating capability and lower solubility of Li-polysulfides than DME: DOL. This is predicted by quantum chemical calculation and verified by experiments. In electrochemical test, MTBE solvent helps to significantly improve the cycling stability of the Li-FeS2 cell. Post-cycling material analysis and impedance tests both indicate that this is due to the alleviated active material dissolution and re-deposition on the lithium anode. Similar improvement is also observed in the Li-CuS cell case. Although the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is also affected by this new solvent and MBTE cannot yet be a satisfactory solution, our study presents important guidance in designing future electrolyte for Li-FeS2 battery.

Surface-enhanced redox chemistry of polysulphides on a metallic and polar host for lithium-sulphur batteries	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; HIGH-CAPACITY; CATHODE; GRAPHENE; ELECTROCHEMISTRY; COMPOSITES; CHALLENGES; ELECTRODES; OXIDE; CELL	The lithium-sulphur battery relies on the reversible conversion between sulphur and Li2S and is highly appealing for energy storage owing to its low cost and high energy density. Porous carbons are typically used as sulfur hosts, but they do not adsorb the hydrophilic polysulphide intermediates or adhere well to Li2S, resulting in pronounced capacity fading. Here we report a different strategy based on an inherently polar, high surface area metallic oxide cathode host and show that it mitigates polysulphide dissolution by forming an excellent interface with Li2S. Complementary physical and electrochemical probes demonstrate strong polysulphide/Li2S binding with this 'sulphiphilic' host and provide experimental evidence for surface-mediated redox chemistry. In a lithium-sulphur cell, Ti4O7/S cathodes provide a discharge capacity of 1,070mAhg(-1) at intermediate rates and a doubling in capacity retention with respect to a typical conductive carbon electrode, at practical sulphur mass fractions up to 70 wt%. Stable cycling performance is demonstrated at high rates over 500 cycles.	[Pang, Quan; Kundu, Dipan; Cuisinier, Marine; Nazar, L.

The flexural properties of composite repaired pipeline: Numerical simulation and experimental validation	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Carbon fibre; Prepreg; Directional orientation; Finite element analysis (FEA); Scale modelling	RISER	The performance of steel riser repaired with fibre reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) subjected to bending load was evaluated. Finite element (FE) analysis was used to simulate the load-strain behaviour of the repaired system. Accuracy of the model was validated against a simplified four-point bending experiment which was scaled to a significantly smaller size. The parameters investigated within the FE simulation and experimental tests are based on three conditions of the pipe riser - uncorroded, corroded and corroded repaired with designated laminate orientation of carbon/epoxy (C/E) FRPC. Design conditions were determined via a limit analysis known as the double-elastic slope method. The developed FE models based on flexural stiffness was found capable of predicting the same trend of strength improvements as the scaled-down testing of the corroded pipes repaired with different laminate orientation.

Herein, a self-supported bimetallic Ni-Fe phosphide (Ni-Fe-P) electrode with a newfangled and multidimensional construction was synthesized by a two-step process. This electrode consists of connective nanosheets which combined numerous interlinked nanoparticles with well-distributed mesopores. By investigating the effects of phosphating temperatures, an optimal phosphide electrode with well-distributed pores throughout the interlaced nanosheets has been obtained. Due to this sophisticated porous structure and the mechanical stability enhanced by the direct growth on binderless Ni foam, the Ni-Fe-P electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are also performed to demonstrate the increased electrical conductivity and reactivity after the introduction of Fe atoms and phosphorization. Impressively, the fabricated Ni-Fe-P//reduced graphene oxide solid-state SC device delivers an outstanding energy density of 50.2 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1), and remarkable cycle performance (91.5% retention rate after 10 000 cycles). This comprehensive work not only displays a new perspective of the phosphating mechanism at different temperatures but also suggests a versatile approach for engineering promising electrode materials for advanced SCs.

Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) satellite observations of ammonia, methanol, formic acid, and carbon monoxide over the Canadian oil sands: validation and model evaluation	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							AIR-POLLUTION; ACETIC-ACIDS; GLOBAL DISTRIBUTIONS; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; DAILY MORTALITY; ORGANIC-ACIDS; TRACE GASES; EXCHANGE; INSTRUMENT; NH3	The wealth of air quality information provided by satellite infrared observations of ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), and methanol (CH3OH) is currently being explored and used for a number of applications, especially at regional or global scales. These applications include air quality monitoring, trend analysis, emissions, and model evaluation. This study provides one of the first direct validations of Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) satellite-retrieved profiles of NH3, CH3OH, and HCOOH through comparisons with coincident aircraft profiles. The comparisons are performed over the Canadian oil sands region during the intensive field campaign (August-September, 2013) in support of the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring (JOSM). The satellite/aircraft comparisons over this region during this period produced errors of (i) +0.08 +/- 0.25 ppbv for NH3, (ii) +7.5 +/- 23 ppbv for CO, (iii) +0.19 +/- 0.46 ppbv for HCOOH, and (iv) 1.1 +/- 0.39 ppbv for CH3OH. These values mostly agree with previously estimated retrieval errors; however, the relatively large negative bias in CH3OH and the significantly greater positive bias for larger HCOOH and CO values observed during this study warrant further investigation. Satellite and aircraft ammonia observations during the field campaign are also used in an initial effort to perform preliminary evaluations of Environment Canada's Global Environmental Multi-scale-Modelling Air quality and CHemistry (GEM-MACH) air quality modelling system at high resolution (2.5 +/- 2.5 km(2). These initial results indicate a model underprediction of similar to 0.6 ppbv (similar to 60 %) for NH3, during the field campaign period. The TES/model CO comparison differences are similar to+20 ppbv (similar to +20 %), but given that under these conditions the TES/aircraft comparisons also show a small positive TES CO bias indicates that the overall model underprediction of CO is closer to similar to 10% at 681 hPa (similar to 3 km) during this period.

Such electricity consuming processes cost a large number of heat exchangers and compressors. In this study, a two-stage demonstration unit had been constructed and demonstrated to purify hydrogen (including useful nitrogen for ammonia synthesis) from on-site sideline shift gas mixture at Yangmei Fengxi ammonia plant. For the first stage, an 8-column hydrogen purification process by novel elevated temperature pressure swing adsorption (ET-PSA, operated at 180 to 220 degrees C) was developed and demonstrated to capture H2S and CO2 simultaneously by hydrophobic activated carbon (AC) to reduce the impurities compared to that of room temperature PSA. Working condition at elevated temperature was proved to be appropriate and stable for reversible H2S removal by AC. The second stage was a temperature swing adsorption for deep purification of CO to 0.2 ppm by commercial CuCl monolayer dispersed zeolites (PU-1 synthesized by Beijing Peking University Pioneer Technology Co., Ltd.). In order to examine the standard of trace impurities such CO and H2S in product H-2, the purified H-2 was offered to a 3 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack to prove that all carbon and sulfur impurities met the demand not only for ammonia synthesis, but for PEMFC as well. Besides, two novel PSA steps: high pressure steam rinse and low pressure nitrogen purge were adopted to improve H-2 recovery to above 93%. To demonstrate its stability, over 2500 h of operation had been carried out on the small-scale demonstration rigs by far.

In this report we describe the fabrication of a hierarchical layer-by-layer porous FeCo2S4@Ni(OH)(2) three-dimensional (3D) network on nickel foam, which shows both an excellent specific capacitance of 2984 F g(-1) at 5 mA cm(-2) and cycling stability over 5000 cycles. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the distinctive self-supported structure and the synergistic effect between FeCo2S4 and Ni(OH)(2). Moreover, the all-solid-state FeCo2S4@Ni(OH)(2)//reduced graphene oxide asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 64 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1) and excellent cycling stability (92.9% of capacity retention after 10000 cycles), while the output voltage can reach 1.6 V. This rational design of the layer-by-layer structured electrode provides an innovative strategy for fabricating electrodes for future energy storage devices.

The composites were fabricated into coin type liquid cells and all-solid-state cells and operated as rechargeable batteries at room temperature. The reversible capacity of the coin type liquid cells decreased from 484 to 33 mAh g(-1) over 50 charge-discharge cycles, because the polysulfides formed from the redox reactions of a-TiS3/S dissolved in the liquid electrolyte. On the other hand, the all-solid-state cells showed higher reversible capacity and better cyclability than the coin type liquid cells. In order to improve their cycle performance, solid electrolyte (SE) powders were added to the composite electrodes to serve as lithium-ion conduction paths to the active materials. The cell using the a-TiS3/S/KB composite with 30 wt% SE exhibited the highest reversible capacity of about 850 mAh g(-1) at the 1st cycle and retained a reversible capacity of about 650 mAh g(-1) after the 50th cycle. Owing to their relatively high sulfur content, composite positive electrodes of a-TiS3/S/KB are attractive positive electrodes with high capacities for all-solid-state lithium secondary batteries.

Herein, a lithiophilic three-dimensional Li anode scaffold, which is prepared by molten Li infusion aided by confined growth of low-cost Zn clusters, is rationally constructed for high-performance LMBs. Owing to the synergy of the carbon host and the effective regulation from the Zn nanoclusters, the large volumetric change of Li metal is well mitigated and shows a smooth and dendrite-free behavior. The Li anode scaffold can deliver much improved Coulombic efficiency, superior rate performance, and long cycle lifespan with much lower voltage polarization. Furthermore, the half cells of Li anode scaffold paired with LiFePO4/LiCoO2/sulfur can achieve a higher specific capacity and longer stable cycling life than those with conventional Li foil. The Li|LFP cells can achieve a stable cycling over 250 cycles at 1C with a higher capacity retention of approximate to 90.8%, and a higher initial discharge capacity of 924.6 mAh g(-1) with a high capacity retention over 300 cycles can also be obtained in Li|S cells at 1C.

Lightning Strike Ablation Damage Characteristic Analysis for Carbon Fiber/Epoxy Composite Laminate with Fastener	APPLIED COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						Composite laminate with fastener; Lightning strike; Ablation damage characteristic; Thermal-electrical coupling analysis		In order to analyze the lightning strike ablation damage characteristic of composite laminate with fastener, based on the energy-balance relationship in lightning strike, mathematical analysis model of ablation damage of composite laminate with fastener was constructed. According to the model, an effective three dimensional thermal-electrical coupling analysis finite element model of composite laminate with fastener suffered from lightning current was established based on ABAQUS, and lightning strike ablation damage characteristic was analyzed. Analytical results reveal that lightning current could conduct through the thickness direction of the laminate due to the existence of metallic fastener, and then distribute to all layers, finally conducted in-the-plane of each layer, conductive ability of different layup orientations depend on potential distribution and in-the-plane electrical conductivity along potential gradient declining direction; different potential boundaries correspond to different potential distribution in each layer, and result in conductive ability of different layup orientations was changed, then caused different lightning strike ablation damage distribution. According to the investigation in this paper, we can recognize the lightning strike ablation damage characteristic of composite laminate with fastener qualitatively.	[Yin, J. J.; Li, S.

However, while the solid-electrolyte/electrode interfacial area should be maximized to facilitate the transport of high electrical currents on the one hand, on the other hand, this area should be minimized to reduce the parasitic interfacial reactions and promote the overall cell stability. To improve these aspects simultaneously, we report the use of an interfacial inorganic coating and the study of its impact on the local Li-ion transport over the grain boundaries. Via exchange-NMR measurements, we quantify the equilibrium between the various phases present at the interface between an S-based positive electrode and an inorganic solid-electrolyte. We also demonstrate the beneficial effect of the LiI coating on the all-solid-state cell performances, which leads to efficient sulfur activation and prevention of solid-electrolyte decomposition. Finally, we report 200 cycles with a stable capacity of around 600 mAh g(-1) at 0.264 mA cm(-2) for a full lab-scale cell comprising of LiI-coated Li2S-based cathode, Li-In alloy anode and Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte. Development of all-solid-state batteries requires stable solid electrolyte-electrode interfaces. Here, via exchange-NMR measurements, the authors investigate the positive electrode-solid electrolyte interface, revealing the impact of an inorganic coating on the Li-ion transport properties.

Metallic lithium, however, tends to grow parasitic dendrites, which would penetrate the separator to cause safety concerns. Moreover, the dendrites are highly reactive to carbonate electrolytes and invariably render a reduced Coulombic efficiency. Here, we propose our design of a dendrite blocking layer with size-tunable Ag nanoparticles (NPs) decorated on the mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres. The synergistic coupling of these complementary components enables the effective regulation of the lithium nucleation behavior via a protected Li-Ag alloying process. The Li plating/stripping process of a symmetric Ag NPs@SiO2-coated Li-metal cell exhibits a reduced voltage hysteresis, facile lithium nucleation process, and enhanced Coulombic efficiencies at various current densities. When the Ag NPs@SiO2-coated copper foil anode was integrated with lithium manganese oxide (LMO) or sulfur (5) cathodes in full-cell configurations, both the Li-LMO and the Li-S cells exhibit high energy densities with a Coulombic efficiency of similar to 98.5% for 150 cycles. Furthermore, a flexible metallic cell model with satisfactory mechanical and electrochemical cycling stability (up to 1750 h) was established. The prototype directly integrates the modified polyethylene (PE) separator with the Ag NPs@SiO2 dendrite blocking layer. Our approach could lead to the simultaneous realization of high energy density, mechanical flexibility, and safe operation of Li-metal-based batteries.

However, previously reported gas-foamed scaffolds sometimes showed insufficient interconnectivity or pore size for tissue engineering. In this study, we have correlated the thermal and rheological properties of PCL scaffolds with their porous morphology by studying four foamed samples with varied molecular weight (MW), and particularly aimed to clarify the required properties for the fabrication of scaffolds with favorable interconnected macropores. DSC and rheological tests indicate that samples show a delayed crystallization and enhanced complex viscosity with the increasing of MW. After foaming, scaffolds (27 kDa in weight-average molecular weight) show a favorable morphology (pore size = 70-180 mu m, porosity = 90% and interconnectivity = 96%), where the lowest melt strength favors the generation of interconnected macropore, and the most rapid crystallization provides proper foamability. The scaffolds (27 kDa) also possess the highest Young's modulus. More importantly, owing to the sufficient room and favorable material transportation provided by highly interconnected macropores, cells onto the optimized scaffolds (27 kDa) perform vigorous proliferation and superior adhesion and ingrowth, indicating its potential for regeneration applications. Furthermore, our findings provide new insights into the morphological control of porous scaffolds fabricated by scCO(2) foaming, and are highly relevant to a broader community that is focusing on polymer foaming.

The doped carbon matrix was melt-infiltrated with sulfur to form a carbonized ZIF-8/S composite. The composite material exhibited good performance as the cathode for room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery (Na-S) systems. A reversible specific capacity of around 1000 mA h g(-1) could be achieved at a rate of 0.1C; and a reversible specific capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) was obtained at a rate of 0.2C after 250 cycles. The good performance of the Na-S battery could be attributed to the synergistic effect from the nanoporosity of the carbon matrix and the high nitrogen-doping content (ca. similar to 18 at%). These attributes enhanced the entrapment of the sulfur molecules inside the carbon matrices.

New material or new battery system development is an alternative approach to achieve the goal of new high-energy storage system with energy densities 5 times or more greater. A series of SeSx-carbon (x = 0-7) composite materials has been prepared and evaluated as the positive electrodes in secondary lithium cells with ether-based electrolyte. In situ synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction was utilized to investigate the crystalline phase transition during cell cycling. Complementary, in situ Se K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis was used to track the evolution of the Se valence state for both crystalline and noncrystalline Phases, including amorphous and electrolyte-dissolved phases in the (de)lithiation process. On the basis of these results, a mechanism for the (de)lithiation process is proposed, where Se is reduced to the polyselenides, Li2Sen (n >= 4), Li2Se2, and Li2Se sequentially during the lithiation and Li2Se is oxidized to Se through Li2Sen (n >= 4) during the delithiation. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated the reversibility of the Li/Se system in ether-based electrolyte and the presence of side products in the carbonate-based electrolytes. For Li/SeS2 and Li/SeS7 cells, Li2Se and Li2S are the discharged products with the presence of Se only as the crystalline phase in the end of charge.

Lignin, a component of the secondary cell wall, is considered a promising source of biomass. Compared to cellulose, which is the most extensively studied biomass material, lignin has a competitive price and a variety of functional groups leading to broad utilization such as adhesive, emulsifier, pesticides, polymer composite, carbon precursor, etc. The lignin-based materials can also be applied to various components in rechargeable batteries such as the binder, separator, electrolyte, anode, and cathode. This review describes how lignin-based materials are adopted in these five components with specific examples and explains why lignin is attractive in each case. The electrochemical behaviors including charge-discharge profiles, cyclability, and rate performance are discussed between lignin-based materials and materials without lignin. Finally, current limitations and future prospects are categorized to provide design guidelines for advanced lignin-based materials.

The local oxygen transport resistances of 30wt.%Pt/C catalyst layer and 60wt.%Pt/C carbon -doped dilution catalyst layers were calculated and compared by limiting the current density test. During this process, the total mass transfer resistance was replaced by pressure -independent oxygen transport resistance to eliminate the effect of pressure -dependent mass transfer resistance, thus, Knudsen diffusion resistances in the catalyst layer and microporous layer were considered. Results showed that 60wt.%Pt/C carbon -doped dilution catalyst layer exhibited higher bulk phase Knudsen diffusion resistance and local oxygen transport resistance than that of 30wt.%Pt/C catalyst layer, thereby, decreasing the performance at high current density. In addition, the reasons for lower performance were also analyzed.

Elevated Ozone Concentration Reduces Photosynthetic Carbon Gain but Does Not Alter Leaf Structural Traits, Nutrient Composition or Biomass in Switchgrass	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						ozone; switchgrass; photosynthesis; stomatal conductance; chlorophyll fluorescence; leaf anatomy; biomass	WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; OPEN-AIR ELEVATION; C-4 PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; PLANT CARBON; GROWTH; NITROGEN; MAIZE; CO2	Elevated tropospheric ozone concentration (O-3) increases oxidative stress in vegetation and threatens the stability of crop production. Current O-3 pollution in the United States is estimated to decrease the yields of maize (Zea mays) up to 10%, however, many bioenergy feedstocks including switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) have not been studied for response to O-3 stress. Using Free Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE) technology, we investigated the impacts of elevated O-3 (similar to 100 nmol mol(-1)) on leaf photosynthetic traits and capacity, chlorophyll fluorescence, the Ball-Woodrow-Berry (BWB) relationship, respiration, leaf structure, biomass and nutrient composition of switchgrass. Elevated O-3 concentration reduced net CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), and maximum CO2 saturated photosynthetic capacity (V-max), but did not affect other functional and structural traits in switchgrass or the macro- (except potassium) and micronutrient content of leaves. These results suggest that switchgrass exhibits a greater O-3 tolerance than maize, and provide important fundamental data for evaluating the yield stability of a bioenergy feedstock crop and for exploring O-3 sensitivity among bioenergy feedstocks.

Practical applications of such a cathode, however, still suffer from low redox activity, unaffordable cost, and poor processability of infusible and moisture-sensitive Li2S. Herein, these difficulties are addressed by developing a molecular cage-engaged strategy that enables low-cost production and interfacial engineering of Li2S cathodes for rechargeable Li2S//Si cells. An efficient chemisorption-electrocatalytic interface is built in extremely nanostructured Li2S cathodes by harnessing the confinement/separation effect of metal-organic molecular cages on ionic clusters of air-stable, soluble, and low-cost Li salt and their chemical transformation. It effectively boosts the redox activity toward Li2S activation/dissociation and polysulfide chemisorption-conversion in Li-S batteries, leading to low activation voltage barrier, stable cycle life of 1000 cycles, ultrafast current rate up to 8 C, and high areal capacities of Li2S cathodes with high mass loading. Encouragingly, this highly active Li2S cathode can be applied for constructing truly workable Li2S//Si cells with a high specific energy of 673 Wh kg(-1) and stable performance for 200 cycles at high rates against hollow nanostructured Si anode.

The thin gold film evaporated on a glass slate, which was employed as the SPR sensing film, was modified by hollow gold nanoparticles (HGNPs) and polydopamine (PDA) sequentially, and then was immobilized with antibodies for specific recognition of target analyte. Electronic coupling of the surface plasmon waves originating from the HGNPs and the gold film leads to the remarkable amplification of SPR response. The PDA film modified on the gold film via self-polymerization of dopamine (DA) facilitates the direct immobilization of capture antibodies (cAb). To separate and enrich the target analyte, PDA-wrapped magnetic multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MMWCNTs-PDA) were conjugated with detection antibodies (dAb) and used as the extracting agent for the magnetic extraction of cTnI in sample. Large surface area of MMWCNTs-PDA ensures its loading capacity for dAb, as well as its extraction efficiency for cTnI. By serving as the "vehicles" for fast delivering the concentrated analyte to the SPR sensing surface, MMWCNTs-PDA-dAb also overcomes the disadvantage of slow diffusionlimited mass transfer and matrix interference effect in regular patterns. The combination of the above improvements results in the significant sensitivity enhancement of the SPR immunoassay. The concentration of cTnI with minimum detectable SPR response obtained by the present assay is 1.25 ng mL(-1), which is 1000-fold lower than that obtained by the traditional SPR immunoassay based on PDA-modified gold film.

Effects of ultrasonic power and sonication time on the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) filled ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) nanocomposites were experimentally studied. Transmission Electron Microscopy images showed that homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in intractable UHMWPE matrix is successfully realized due to the synergetic effect of ultrasonic wave and extensional deformation without any aid of other additives or solvents. Differential scanning calorimetry results revealed an increase in crystallinity and crystallization rate due to the finer dispersion of the CNTs in the matrix which act as nucleating point. Composites' complex viscosity and storage modulus decreased sharply at first and then leveled off with the increase of sonication time or the ultrasonic power. The thermal stability and the tensile strength of the CNTs/UHMWPE nanocomposites improved by using this novel mixing method. This is the first method that combined the ultrasonic wave and the extensional deformation in which the elongation rate, sonication time and ultrasonic power can be adjusted simultaneously during mixing. The novel mixer offers several advantages such as environment-friendly, high mixing efficiency, self-cleaning and wide adaptability to materials.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of supplementary light intensity and CO2 concentration on the photosynthesis, yield, and fruit quality of fresh hot pepper (cultivar Meite). Two light intensities-supplementary (SLI) and natural (NLI) light intensity with the averaged photosynthetic active radiation of the whole growth period of 463 and 233 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively-and 4 CO2 concentrations (400, 550, 700, and 900 mu mol mol(-1)) were conducted on pepper planted in pots in phytotrons over the autumn and winter seasons in the arid Northwest region of China. Results showed that: (i) CO2 enrichment significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), water use efficiency (WUE), yield parameters, and fruit storage qualities, but decreased the fruit nutrition qualities to different extents. (ii) SLI increased Pn, WUE, and fruit nutrition qualities to different extents, and increased fruit yield per plant (FYPP) by 157%. (iii) The treatment with SLI and a CO2 concentration of 550 mu mol mol(-1) can maximize the overall quality of pepper fruits and significantly increase FYPP with a first ranking in the technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Therefore, the yield of pepper grown in the off-season was increased and fruit quality was maintained by SLI and moderately increasing CO2 concentration (550 mu mol mol(-1)).

Unlike crystalline MOF, amorphous CP is nonspecific to metal cation species, therefore its composition can be tuned easily. Here, it is shown that amorphous CP can be used as general synthesis precursors of highly complex mixed metal oxide shells. As a proof of concept, Ni-Co coordination polymer spheres are first synthesized and subsequently transformed into seven-layered Ni-Co oxide onions by rapid thermal oxidation. This approach is very versatile and can be applied to produce ternary and quaternary metal oxide onions with tunable size and composition. The Ni-Co oxide onions exhibit exceptional charge storage capability in aqueous electrolyte with high specific capacitance (approximate to 1900 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1)), good rate capability, and ultrahigh cycling stability (93.6% retention over 20 000 cycles). A hybrid supercapacitor against graphene/multishelled mesoporous carbon sphere shows a high energy density of 52.6 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 1604 W kg(-1) (based on active materials weight), as well as remarkable cycling stability.

We hypothesize that the climatic impact of boreal fires depends on local landscape heterogeneity such as burn severity, prefire vegetation type, and soil properties. To test this hypothesis, spatially explicit emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and their resulting radiative forcing are required as an important and necessary component towards a full assessment. In this study, we integrated remote sensing (Landsat and MODIS) and models (carbon consumption model, emission factors model, and radiative forcing model) to calculate the carbon consumption, GHGs and aerosol emissions, and their radiative forcing of 2001-2010 fires at 30 m resolution in the Yukon River Basin of Alaska. Total carbon consumption showed significant spatial variation, with a mean of 2,615 g C m(-2) and a standard deviation of 2,589 g C m(-2). The carbon consumption led to different amounts of GHGs and aerosol emissions, ranging from 593.26 Tg (CO2) to 0.16 Tg (N2O). When converted to equivalent CO2 based on global warming potential metric, the maximum 20 years equivalent CO2 was black carbon (713.77 Tg), and the lowest 20 years equivalent CO2 was organic carbon (-583.13 Tg). The resulting radiative forcing also showed significant spatial variation: CO2, CH4, and N2O can cause a 20-year mean radiative forcing of 7.41 W m(-2) with a standard deviation of 2.87 W m(-2). This emission forcing heterogeneity indicates that different boreal fires have different climatic impacts. When considering the spatial variation of other forcings, such as surface shortwave forcing, we may conclude that some boreal fires, especially boreal deciduous fires, can warm the climate.

Spin-Polarized Positronium Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy for Probing Spin Polarized Surface Electronic States	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								The energy spectrum of positronium atoms generated at a solid surface reflects the electron density of states (DOS) associated solely with the first surface layer. Using spin-polarized positrons, the spin-dependent surface DOS can be studied. For this purpose, we have developed a spin-polarized positronium time-of-flight spectroscopy apparatus based on a Na-22 positron source and an electrostatic beam transportation system, which enables the sampling of topmost surface electrons around the Gamma point and near the Fermi level. We applied this technique to nonmagnetic Pt(111) and W(001), ferromagnetic Ni (111), Co(0001) and graphene on them, Co2FeGa0.5Ge0.5 (CFGG) and Co2MnSi (CMS). The results showed that the electrons of Ni(111) and Co(0001) surfaces have characteristic negative spin polarizations, while these spin polarizations vanished upon graphene deposition, suggesting that the spin polarizations of graphene on Ni(111) and Co(0001) were mainly induced at the Dirac points that were out of range in the present measurement. The CFGG and CMS surfaces also exhibited only weak spin polarizations suggesting that the half-metallicity expected for these bulk states was not maintained at the surfaces.

Despite the success of trapping soluble polysulphides in a matrix with high surface area, spatial control of solid-state sulphur and lithium sulphide species deposition as a critical aspect has not been demonstrated. Herein, we show a clear visual evidence that these solid species deposit preferentially onto tin-doped indium oxide instead of carbon during electrochemical charge/discharge of soluble polysuphides. To incorporate this concept of spatial control into more practical battery electrodes, we further prepare carbon nanofibers with tin-doped indium oxide nanoparticles decorating the surface as hybrid three-dimensional electrodes to maximize the number of deposition sites. With 12.5 mu l of 5 M Li2S8 as the catholyte and a rate of C/5, we can reach the theoretical limit of Li2S8 capacity similar to 1,470 mAhg(-1) (sulphur weight) under the loading of hybrid electrode only at 4.3 mg cm(-2).

In this paper the carbonate production by scleractinian corals at Luhuitou fringing reef, Sanya, Hainan Island, China, is investigated with an ecological census-based method. Averaged carbonate production is 1.16 +/- 0.55 kg center dot m(-2) center dot a(-1) and 3.52 +/- 1.32 kg center dot m(-2) center dot a(-1) on the reef flat and reef slope, respectively, depending on the composition and distribution of corals and the intergeneric difference of skeletal growth. In response to the rapidly increasing human impacts, coral carbonate production has decreased by 80%-89% at this fringing reef since the 1960s; as a result, the reef accretion rate declined and became lower than the rate of sea level rise. Further development of the Luhuitou fringing reef will switch significantly from lateral extension seawards to vertical growth, reflecting a response of coral reef bio-geomorphic process to strong human impacts under the background of global sea level rise. In addition, decrease in coral carbonate production reduced CO(2) release from this fringing reef. In the future, it is likely that the role played by coral reefs, especially of fringing reefs, in the ocean and even in the global carbon cycle will be modified or weakened by the increasing human impacts.

Several complexes were synthesized and characterized. For 1 center dot Li+, C similar to S coordination is forced, whereas for 2 center dot Li+, S similar to S and C similar to S coordination can be achieved. In one case, a dynamic equilibrium between these two modes of coordination was observed. DFT calculations were carried out to rationalize this phenomenon and the stability of the methanide compounds.

Therefore, it is not easy to prepare multifunctional nano-matrix membranes with excellent performance. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have superiority in absorption of impurities and contaminants in aqueous solution. Therefore, Polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration membrane modified by CNTs and PAA-g-MWCNT/TiO2 (AMT) organic-inorganic hybrid particles is synthesized. And a new nano matrix composite membrane PAA-g-MWCNT/TiO2@PES (AMTP) is prepared after the combination of the two particles, which endows the new composite membrane with three major effects of fouling resistance, photo catalysis and antibacterial properties. When the amount of AMT was 1 wt%, AMTP had the highest anti-pollution rate (31.21%); the best flux recovery rate (85.76%) and the degradation efficiency of MB and MO reached 90.03%, 62.36% within 2 h; the antibacterial rate was 98.12 %. When the dosage was 2 wt%, the antibacterial rate of AMTP reached 100 %. AMTP nano-matrix composite membranes have considerable adaptability and practicability of a wide application in the wastewater recovery and recycling.

NaS, Na2S, and Na4S, were found to be stable under pressures. The superconducting transition critical temperature was estimated to nearly 0 K at 100 GPa in Na3S due to the weak electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, by the comparison on the structures, the electron features, and alkali metal ions of stoichiometric proportion, we found that not only the pressure but also the number of sodium atoms in the formula unit of alkali metal atoms can promote the insulator-metal transformation in the alkali metal sulfides, such as Li-S, Na-S, and K-S systems.

Herein, we used magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide [Mg(TFSA)(2)] as an electrolyte additive to suppress the growth of Li dendrites, utilizing the occurrence of an alloying reaction between the initially substrate-deposited Mg and the subsequently deposited Li. Notably, no metallic Mg formation and no change in Li deposition morphology were observed at an electrolyte composition of 0.1 M Mg(TFSA)(2) + 0.9 M LiTFSA/triglyme, irrespective of the applied potential. In contrast, increasing the Mg salt concentration to 0.5 M resulted in the deposition of interconnected granules, reflecting a dramatic morphology improvement. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the occurrence of the abovementioned alloying, which finally afforded a deposit composition of Li0.9Mg0.1 via the formation of an intermediate Li0.14Mg0.86 phase. Importantly, the deposits obtained under various applied potentials were relatively smooth, with no needle-like morphology observed.

Taking Liaobin coastal economic zone as an example, two scenarios are built to analyze the potential of energy consumption and CO2 emissions reduction from the aspects of laws, regulations, policies and planning. The baseline scenario refers to the traditional way of energy planning and the community energy planning scenario seeks to apply community energy planning within the zone. Energy consumption and CO2 emission are forecast in two scenarios with the driving factors including GDP growth, changes in population size, energy structure adjustment, energy technology progress, and increase of energy efficiency. To improve accuracy of future GDP and population data prediction, an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model) (1,1,1) model is introduced into GDP prediction and a logistics model is introduced into population prediction. Results show that compared with the baseline scenario, energy consumption levels in the community energy planning scenario are reduced by 140% and CO2 emission levels are reduced by 45%; the short-term and long-term driving factors are analyzed. Policy implications are given for energy conservation and environmental protection.

The elementary reaction kinetics model is comprehensively validated by experimental data from both atmosphere pressure thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and a high pressure adsorption apparatus. The elevated temperature pressure swing adsorption s(PSA) system modeling framework is then developed on the gPROMS commercial simulation platform by further considering comprehensive coupling effects from mass, momentum and energy transport processes, integrated with dynamic boundary condition and realistic operating procedures. The effects of adsorption time, residence time, purge to feed ratio, working pressure and adsorbents capacity on PSA cycling gas separation performance are studied with the proposed modeling framework based on a four-bed two-pressure-equalization PSA process.

Here we report the use of earth-abundant and green calcium and sulfur in unprecedented conversion reaction Ca-S primary cells. Using S-infiltrated mesoporous carbon (abbreviated S@meso-C) cathodes, we achieve discharge capacities as high as 600 mAh g(-1) (S basis) within the geometry Ca|Ca(ClO4)(2)/CH3CN|S@meso-C, at a discharge rate of C/3.5. The electrolyte system in the Ca-S battery is of paramount importance as the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed on the Ca anode limits the capacity and stability of the cell. We determine that 0.5 M Ca(ClO4)(2) in CH3CN forms an SEI that advantageously breaks down under anodic bias to allow oxidation of the anode. This same SEI, however, exhibits high impedance which increases over time at open circuit limiting the shelf life of the cell.

Two different polymer electrolytes, polyethylene oxide (PEO) and poly[bis-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-ethoxyphosphazene] (MEEP), were investigated in combination with lithium ion conductive Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ) particles and two different mixed ionic-electronic conductive ceramic particles: uncoated and carbon coated LiFePO4 (LFP) as typical cathode material and uncoated Li4Ti5O12 as typical anode material. A distinct Volta potential gradient between the particles and the polymer was observable in all cases, except when no lithium salt was present within the polymer matrix. The measured potential gradients can be explained in terms of a contact potential between the polymer electrolyte and the ceramic electrolyte. A more negatively charged space charge layer around LFP particles in PEO matrix and around LLZ particles in MEEP can be explained by enrichment of salt anions in direct vicinity of the particle. Electrochemical characterization with impedance spectroscopy showed an increased conductivity for addition of LFP for PEO while the addition of various particles in different concentrations showed no effect on the conductivity of MEEP. The lithium transference number was unaffected by particle addition for all samples.

However, they have to suffer from issues of short cyclic lifespan, low Coulombic efficiency, and poor rate behaviors unfortunately due to the insulating nature for S actives and negative polysulfide intermediates dissolution. As a congener, the conducting selenium (Se) shows the similar Li-storage chemistry to S, with comparable volumetric capacity, superb rate capability, but unluckily low gravimetric capacity and limited cyclic life. To build sustained power systems with preferable behaviors, we put forward an efficient battery promotion strategy by combining merits of S, Se and smart electrode engineering. Herein, Se and S are successively infused into a carbon black (CB) matrix and further packaged by thin nickel nitrate hydroxide layers (S/Se@CB subset of NNH) so as to suppress the actives diffusion losses. Such integrated S/Se@CB subset of NNH hybrids well inherit the superiorities of S, Se and benefit from the integrated electrode design, capable of showing high reversible specific capacities (913 mAh g(-1)), excellent rate capability and cyclic stability (almost 100% Coulombic efficiency), and greatly prolonged lifetime. Our present work may provide an efficient, scalable, and applicable way to develop reliable and superior cathodes for sustainable Li-storage applications.

This paper presents an analytical model for stiffness prediction of CFRP-to-steel double strap joints. Mechanical analysis was performed to determine the shear stress and strain distributions in the bond region, which resulted in deriving a model for stiffness prediction of joints. More than 20 test results from the existing works in the literature were used to validate the proposed model. Results show that the predictions are mostly between 0.8 and 1.2 times the experimental values, with an average error of less than 10%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model. Finally, a parametric study with respect to the bond length and the adherend stiffness ratio was performed to give a better understanding of the effect of different parameters.

However, the limited cycle life, undesirable corrosion, and safety hazards are seriously limiting the practical application of the lithium metal anode in LOBs. Here, we demonstrate a rational design of the Li-Al alloy (LiAlx) anode that successfully achieves ultralong cycling life of LOBs with stable Li cycling. Through in situ high-current pretreatment technology, Al atoms accumulates, and a stable Al2O3-containing solid electrolyte interphase protective film formed on the LiAlx anode surface to suppress side reactions and O-2 crossover. The cycling life of LOB with the protected LiAlx anode increases to 667 cycles under a fixed capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1), as compared to 17 cycles without pretreatment. We believe that this in situ high-current pretreatment strategy presents a new vision to protect the lithium-containing alloy anodes, such as Li-Al, Li-Mg, Li-Sn, and Li-In alloys for stable and safe lithium metal batteries (Li-O-2 and Li-S batteries).

However, the morphological evolution and mechanism of crack healing have no clear consensus. Therefore, in this study, isothermal heat treatment was applied to heal internal cracks at temperatures of 900 degrees C to 1200 degrees C for 15 to 120 minutes. Subsequently, microhardness and tensile tests were performed on the specimen to evaluate the reliability of the healed specimens. The results show that the morphology evolution in crack healing can be divided into three stages. Both atomic diffusion and recrystallization dominate crack healing. Atomic diffusion and recrystallization work together to heal cracks in the first stage. Atomic diffusion allows the recrystallization of materials, and recrystallization accelerates the processes of atomic diffusion. In the second and third stages, atomic diffusion controls crack healing on its own. In addition, with increasing healing time, the ultimate tensile strength and microhardness of the crack healing zone decrease due to the difference in the healing mechanism.

Thermodynamic of thermochemical sulphate reduction	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						thermochemical sulphate reduction; TSR; thermodynamic; Gibbs energy	CARBONATE GAS-RESERVOIRS; CHEMICAL-EQUILIBRIUM; SMACKOVER FORMATION; BURIAL DIAGENESIS; KHUFF FORMATION; ABU-DHABI; SYSTEMS; STATE; DESTRUCTION; EQUATION	Hydrogen sulphide is likely to become more common in produced hydrocarbon fluids, as the exploitation of deep reservoirs increases and unconventional resources get recovered significantly, such as heavy oils or bitumen. Hydrogen sulphide presence in produced oil and gas results in operational, environmental and treatment problems. Therefore, understanding the origin and the amount of hydrogen sulphide in petroleum reservoirs has great importance for petroleum engineers. Three natural processes are set forth to explain the generation of H2S in reservoirs: bacterial sulphate reduction, thermal cracking and thermochemical sulphate reduction (TSR). It is the TSR that leads to the largest amount of H2S. This phenomenon involves hydrocarbon oxidation and sulphate reduction and produces as by-products, hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide, carbonate minerals and heavy organo-sulphur compounds. The reaction mechanisms of TSR, as well as its kinetics, are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we checked the thermodynamic feasibility of TSR, at temperatures prevailing in the reservoirs where TSR is encountered. Firstly, we calculated the Gibbs energy of the reactions proposed by Worden and Smalley (Worden R.H. and Smalley P.C., 1996, H2S producing reactions in deep carbonate gas reservoirs: Khuff Formation, Abu Dhabi, Chem. Geol., 133, p. 157-171). We concluded that they are thermodynamically possible from 25 degrees C, confirming thermodynamic data published by Anisimov (Anisimov L., 1978, Conditions of abiogenic reduction of sulfates in oil and gas bearing basins, Geochem. Int., 15, p. 63) and Yue and co-workers (Yue C., Li S., Ding K., Zhong N., 2003, Study of thermodynamics and kinetics of CH4-CaSO4 and H2S-Fe2O3 systems, Chinese J. chem. Eng., 11, (6), p.696-700., Yue C., Li S., Ding K., Zhong N., 2006, Thermodynamics and kinetics of reaction between C1-C3 hydrocarbons and calcium sulfate in deep carbonate reservoirs, Geochem. J., 40, 87-94). Secondly, we used a non-stoichiometric approach without any pre-requisite chemical scheme this time. We calculated the Gibbs Energy of chemical systems composed by hydrocarbons, sulphur, anhydrite and water. The minimization of the Gibbs Energy lead to find the most probable chemical systems at steady state. Our theoretical results are consistent with the chemical schemes set forth for TSR by Orr (Orr W., 1977, Changes in Sulfur Content and Isotopic Ratios of Sulfur during Petroleum Maturation - study of Big Horn Basin Paleozoic Oils, in R. Campo and J. Goni Eds, Advances in onorganic geochemistry, Madrid Spain, Enadimsa, p. 571-595), by Worden and Smalley (Worden R.H. and Smalley P.C., 1996, H2S producing reactions in deep carbonate gas reservoirs: Khuff Formation, Abu Dhabi, Chem. Geol., 133, p. 157-171) and by Machel (Machel H.G., 2001, Bacterial and thermochemical sulfate reduction in diagenetic settings - old and new insights, Sedimentary Geology, 140, p. 143-175). Moreover, they are in concordance with some in-situ observations: anhydrite and hydrocarbon consumption with simultaneous formation of calcite, hydrogen sulphide and water. Our results showed as well that the larger the number of the carbon atoms in the reactant hydrocarbons, the more irreversible the reaction is. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, a mitochondria-targeted and near-infrared (NIR) light-activable multitasking nano-graphene (i.e., GT/IR820/DP-CpG) was engineered to in situ trigger highly efficient "triple-punch" strategy of cancer photo dynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and immunotherapy. Modification of triphenylphosphonium on graphene made the vehicle specifically guide the NIR dye IR820 home to mitochondria, followed by lysosomes escape in a time-dependent manner. The photoactive nanocomplex generated an abundant reactive oxygen species as well as photothermal heat to ultimately kill cancer cells by inducing mitochondrial collapse and irreversible cell apoptosis upon the NIR laser irradiation. Further introduction of an immunostimulatory conjugate DP-CpG significantly promoted the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma) and thus improved the immunogenicity of tumors. In vivo studies demonstrated that GT/IR820/DP-CpG remarkably inhibited tumor growth (tumor inhibition rate, similar to 88%) resulting from the combinational phototherapeutic effect of IR820 and immunostimulatory activity of DP-CpG, thereby causing negligible toxic effects on mice. Our work provides a new paradigm of architecting organelle-targeted and stimulative nanocomplex for highly efficient cancer photoimmunotherapy.

An experimental investigation and theoretical analysis were made on the law of deflection development and stiffness degradation, as well as the influence of fatigue load ranges. Test results indicate that the law of three-stage change under fatigue loading is followed by both midspan deflection and permanent deflection, which also have positive correlation with fatigue load amplitude. Fatigue stiffness of composite strengthened beams degrades gradually with the increasing of number of cycles. Based on the experimental results, a theoretical model by effective moment of inertia method is developed for calculating the sectional stiffness of such composite strengthened beams under fatigue loading, and the calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental results.

Recent research reports indicated the possibility of room-temperature sodium-ion sulfur chemistry for large storage including smart grids. Here, we report a room-temperature sodium sulfur battery cathode that will address the native downsides of a sodium sulfur battery, such as polysulfide shuttling and low electrical conductivity of elemental sulfur. In this Letter, we use a sustainable route which ensures a large sulfur confinement (i.e., similar to 90 wt %) in the cathode structure. The sulfur-embedded polymer is realized via thermal ring-opening polymerization of benzoxazine in the presence of elemental sulfur (CS90) and later composite with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The resulting CS90 allows a homogeneous distribution of sulfur due to in situ formation of the polymer backbone and allows maximum utilization of sulfur. This unique electrode structure bestows CS90 rGO with an excellent Coulombic efficiency (99%) and healthy cycle life.

This anode structure can guide the alloying position inside the hollow nanospheres, and also confine the alloy sizes within the hollow nanospheres, resulting in significantly restricted volumetric expansion and ultrastable solid electrolyte interface (SEI). As a result, the battery demonstrates an excellent long-term cycling stability within 1500 cycles with approximate to 99% capacity retention at 2 C. Moreover, this cell displays an energy density of 169 Wh kg(-1) even at high power density of 2113 W kg(-1) (10 C, charge and discharge within 6 min), which is much higher than most of conventional lithium ion batteries. The interfacial engineering strategy shown in this work to stabilize SEI layer and control the alloy forming position could be generalized to promote the research development of metal anodes based battery systems.

The carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope compositions of the various karst rocks are analyzed systematically and compared to rocks without karst corrosion. The results indicate that (1) the Huanglong Formation in the eastern Sichuan Basin was a restricted bay supplied and controlled by freshwater in which mud-micrite and mud-dolomicrite exhibit low C-13 and O-18 values and high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios; (2) all types of karstic rocks in the paleokarst reservoirs of the Huanglong Formation in the research area are affected by atmospheric freshwater with the C-13 and O-18 values and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in the original formation approaching those of atmospheric freshwater, which reflects ancient hydrological conditions, fluid properties, isotopic source and the fractionation effect; (3) the intensely corroded and replaced secondary limestone is affected by a variety of diagenetic fluids, often reflected by C-13 and O-18 values, while the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios exhibit the strong degree of the corrosion; (4) after comparing the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of each type of karst rock, the diagenetic fluids are determined to be mainly atmospheric freshwater, and depending on the strength of corrosion, and the low Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio fluids in the layer will participate in the karst process. The carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopes of different karstic reservoirs can provide meaningful geochemical information for forecasting and evaluating the development and distribution rules of the Huanglong Formation at the margin of the eastern Sichuan Basin in time and space.

However, it is difficult to ensure high capacity and high flexibility simultaneously through conventional electrode preparation processes. Herein, smart conductive textiles are employed as current collectors for flexible LIBs owing to their inherent flexibility, fibrous network, rough surface for better adhesion, and electrical conductivity. Conductivity and flexibility are further enhanced by nanosizing lithium titanate oxide (LTO) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) active materials, and hybridizing them with a flexible 2D graphene template. The resulting LTO/LFP full cells demonstrate high areal capacity and flexibility with tolerance to mechanical fatigue. The battery achieves a capacity of 1.2 mA h cm(-2) while showing excellent flexibility. The cells demonstrate stable open circuit voltage retention under repeated flexing for 1000 times at a bending radius of 10 mm. The discharge capacity of the unflexed battery is retained in cells subjected to bending for 100 times at bending radii of 30, 20, and 10 mm, respectively, confirming that the suggested electrode configuration successfully prevents structural damage (delamination or cracking) upon repeated deformation.

However, low utilization, sluggish lithium ion insertion kinetics and rapid capacity fading prevent their practical application. Herein, defect-rich iron disulfide nanoflowers are synthesized by self-assembly on a hierarchical porous catalytic heteroatom-doped carbon matrix. Both electrochemical experiments and density functional theory simulations reveal that the iron defects in the cathode help to decrease the diffusion barrier so that lithium ions can freely and easily insert into the crystal and improve the transport kinetics. Meanwhile, the hierarchical porous structure also accommodates volumetric changes and facilitates electrolyte immersion. As a consequence, the as-prepared cathode delivers an initial specific capacity of 841 mA h g(-1)at 0.1C and retains an energy density of similar to 500 W h kg(-1)at a high power density of 26.7 kW kg(-1)(20C). Even working for 3000 cycles at 4C, the cell can still preserve an energy efficiency of above 95% and display a high energy density of 220 W h kg(-1)with an average capacity fading as low as 0.020% per cycle, showing its superior electrochemical stability and lifetime.

However, uncontrollable spatial growth of lithium dendrites and the crack of solid electrolyte interphase still hinder its application. Herein, Schottky defects are motivated to tune the 4f-center electronic structures of catalysts to provide active sites to accelerate Li transport kinetics. As experimentally and theoretically confirmed, the electronic density is redistributed and affected by the Schottky defects, offering numerous active catalytic centers with stronger ion diffusion capability to guide the horizontal lithium deposition against dendrite growth. Consequently, the Li electrode with artificial electronic-modulation layer remarkably decreases the barriers of desolvation, nucleation, and diffusion, extends the dendrite-free plating lifespan up to 1200 h, and improves reversible Coulombic efficiency. With a simultaneous catalytic effect on the conversions of sulfur species at the cathodic side, the integrated Li-S full battery exhibits superior rate performance of 653 mA h g(-1) at 5 C, high long-life capacity retention of 81.4% at 3 C, and a high energy density of 2264 W h kg(-1) based on sulfur in a pouch cell, showing the promising potential toward high-safety and long-cycling lithium metal batteries.

In this study, the behaviour of composite columns subjected to eccentric loading was investigated. The experimental results proved that the strengthening technique was effective, particularly as the load-bearing capacities of the strengthened columns increased by 11.6%-38.2% when compared with those of the un-strengthened columns. Moreover, the enhancing effect increased with an increase in the number of the CFRP textile layers. Compared with the specimens subjected to axial loading, the eccentric-loaded specimens exhibited a lower load bearing capacity and stiffness. Besides, the decrease in the diameter-thickness ratio and increase in concrete strength significantly enhanced the load-bearing capacity of the strengthened columns. However, a higher concrete strength increased the brittleness. A model was proposed to predict the load-bearing capacity and N-M curves. The calculation results conform with the test results.

Characteristics of AlN inclusions in low carbon Fe-Mn-Si-Al TWIP steel produced by AOD-ESR method	IRONMAKING & STEELMAKING			English	Article						TWIP steels; AOD; ESR; Aluminium nitride inclusions; Thermodynamics	LIQUID-IRON; HOT-DUCTILITY; AIN FORMATION; ALUMINUM; NITROGEN; THERMODYNAMICS; SOLUBILITY; ALLOYS; EQUILIBRIUM; MECHANISM	Argon oxygen decarburisation-electroslag remelting (AOD-ESR) process has been well used to produce the Fe-Mn-Si-Al twinning induced plasticity steel (TWIP) steels. The characteristics of AlN inclusions formed in TWIP steels after AOD refining, ESR and forging process were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry. An automated program called 'INCAFeature' was used to collect statistics of inclusion characteristics. Great differences on the amount, distribution and morphologies of AlN inclusions were observed in AOD ingots, ESR ingots and forgings. The dominating inclusions in AOD ingots are mainly single Al(O) N and MnS(Se)-Al(O) N aggregate, accounting for 66.7% of the total inclusions. After the ESR process, AlN inclusions in all size range significantly decreased, which were rarely observed in ESR ingots. Thermodynamic calculations show that AlN inclusions can precipitate in the liquid Fe-Mn-Si-Al TWIP steels, which is different from the viewpoint of literatures that the precipitation of AlN inclusions took place at solidifying front or solid phase. Furthermore, the thermodynamic calculation result has been verified by high temperature laser scanning confocal microscope experiments.

In the outcrop, large number of carbonate concretions developed in Chang 7 member in Tongchuan. Those concretions were studied in terms of stable isotope, clumped isotope to delineate its origin and sedimentary environment. Two types of concretions are identified. Type A concretionsmainly distribute in organic-rich shale. This concretion was divided into the inner circular layer and the outer circular layer. In the inner circular layer, the value of delta C-13 parts per thousand(VPDB) is 9.98 parts per thousand similar to 14.19 parts per thousand, and the value of delta O-18 parts per thousand(VPDB) is -13.32 parts per thousand similar to-10.07 parts per thousand. On the contrary, the delta C-13 and delta O-18 value of outer circular layer are4.74 parts per thousand similar to-0.59 parts per thousand,17.86 parts per thousand similar to-15.59 parts per thousand respectively. The formation palaeotemperature of different parts of concretion ranged from 28.6 to 76.5 degrees C. This may be due to methanogenesis arising from bacterial activities in the fermentation zone, and the fractional distillation of carbon isotope of organic matter was caused by the methane bacterial activities. The calcite and dolomite spherulites in carbonate concretions may be due to the calcilization and dolomitization of cyanobacteria in the early diagenesis. The type B concretions were distributed in the fine sandstone, silty sandstone, and silty mudstone. The internal structure of concretions is uniform. The carbon isotopic values were negative, and delta C-13 was -5.019 similar to-12.013 parts per thousand, and the delta O-18 values was -17.6 similar to-19.281 parts per thousand. The value of Sr-87/Sr-86 was in the range of 0.710072-0.710392. The temperature was established at 60.4 degrees C through clumped isotopes analysis. Based on isotopic analysis, the formation palaeotemperature at different parts of concretion was 55.4-65.6 degrees C. The origin of the concretion may be related to dehydroxylation in diagenesis, formed in the earlymiddle stage of diagenesis.

J	Li, S; Zhu, MY; Feng, G				Li, Song; Zhu, Mengyang; Feng, Guang			The effects of dication symmetry on ionic liquid electrolytes in supercapacitors	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						dicationic ionic liquids; capacitance; electric double layer; supercapacitor	ELECTRICAL DOUBLE-LAYER; DIFFERENTIAL CAPACITANCE; MICROSTRUCTURE; ADSORPTION; INTERFACE; STABILITY; SIZE	The effects of dication symmetry on the structure and capacitance of the electrical double layers (EDLs) of dicationic ionic liquids (DILs) near graphene electrodes were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in this work. Symmetrical 1-hexyl-3-dimethylimidazolium di[bis(trifluoromethyl) imide]([C-6(mim)(2)](Tf2N)(2)) and asymmetrical 1-(1-trimethylammonium-yl-hexyl)-3-methylimidazolium di[bis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl)imide] ([C-6(tma)(mim)](Tf2N)(2)) were both employed. Radial distribution function (RDF) analysis of the two DILs revealed a shorter distance between the cation-anion pairs in symmetrical [C-6(mim)(2)](Tf2N)(2)), which was attributed to the closely packed imidazolium ring-anion pairs. In contrast, the trimethylammonium head groups and anions exhibit a relatively longer distance, but a stronger correlation in asymmetrical [C-6(tma)(mim)](Tf2N)(2). In addition, it was illustrated that more symmetrical DIL ions in EDLs are distributed near graphite electrodes and exhibit closer distances to the electrode, which is most probably due to the parallel orientation of imidazolium rings, reducing the distance between the cation and the graphene. In contrast, asymmetrical DILs, with one trimethylammonium head group and one imidazolium ring in the dications, are loosely packed due to their tilting orientation near graphene surfaces. However, the capacitance-potential (C-V) curves of the two DILs are almost the same, regardless of the opposite sign of potential of zero charge (PZC), indicating the insignificant influence of dication symmetry on the capacitance of DIL-based supercapacitors.

But how the soil processes and properties respond to N deposition under uncertain fresh litter input is poorly understood. In order to examine the responses of soil respiration and biochemical properties to N addition and aboveground litter manipulation, a field N addition and litterfall manipulation interaction experiment was performed in an evergreen broadleaf forest on the western edge of the Sichuan Basin in China. Three levels of N addition, including an N control (CN, ambient N input) and low N (LN, + 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and high N (HN, + 150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and three levels of litterfall manipulation, including intact litter input (L0, no litter alteration), litter reduction (L-, reduced by 50%) and litter addition (L+, increased by 50%), were conducted monthly starting in January 2014 and August 2015, respectively. Soil respiration was measured monthly from January 2016 to December 2017. Soil samples were collected four times, in October 2016 and January, April and July 2017, to measure soil biochemical properties. The results showed that: (1) short-term N addition did not significantly alter the aboveground litter input in this forest; (2) soil respiration decreased with elevating N input and was associated with amount of litterfall input; (3) N addition increased the total organic C (TOC) concentration in topsoil in subplots without litterfall alteration but did not affect TOC in subplots with increased or decreased litter-input; (4) N addition decreased soil pH and did not affect soil microbial biomass regardless of whether litterfall was altered or not; (5) short-term litter manipulation did not affect any soil properties in the N control plots, but both litterfall reduction and addition tended to reduce surface soil TOC concentration in the N-added plots; and (6) both N addition and litterfall manipulation showed stronger effects on organic soil than on mineral soil. These findings indicated that elevated N input increased the surface soil C content by reducing soil respiration mainly via enhancing stabilization of soil organic matter rather than by reducing soil microbial biomass, and that altered litterfall may mitigate the N-induced increase in soil C. Because of temporal lag, long-term experimentation is needed to investigate the response of soil to altered litter input under different N addition conditions.

Here, we report that a water droplet dropping onto a piece of porous carbon film can spontaneously generate electricity under ambient conditions. Twelve 5-mu L water droplets can generate a voltage up to 5.2 V and illuminate a liquid crystal display. The voltage can be controlled by modulating the direction of the droplet infiltration, the zeta potential of the porous carbon, and the ion concentration. The results demonstrate that a hydrophilic porous carbon film with water droplets may function as a cost-effective electricity generator for harvesting energy from natural resources.

MO was epoxidized and selectively hydrolyzed on the ester group to form epoxidized oleic acid (EOA) that is a bifunctional monomer containing both a carboxylic acid group and an epoxy group. EOA was step-growth polymerized to form a hydroxyl-containing polyester, which was then cured in the presence of a small amount of a polyfunctional epoxide [epoxidized soybean oil or trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TMPTGE)] to afford PSAs. The PSAs from the polyester cured with TMPTGE exhibited high peel strength (2.4 N/10 mm), high tack force (5.8 N), and sufficient shear resistance (9.0 min). The PSAs can be fully based on renewable natural materials, and their preparations are environmentally friendly. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, native passivation film (NPF), which is inevitable on the surface, can change the topography and surface composition distribution, and thus deteriorate the performance stability of lithium metal electrodes. Unfortunately, these effects are always neglected during the evaluation of anode or cathode materials of LIBs. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of NPF on the electrochemical performance of lithium metal electrodes. After the removal of NPF by polishing, both the interfacial impedance and electrode overpotential are significantly decreased, with a more homogeneous lithium deposition during the charge/discharge process. When it is employed as the reference electrode for characterizing the commercial LiFePO4 or graphite materials in a coin cell, the consistency of the results is remarkably improved. This work not only provides an insight for the interfacial electrochemistry of lithium metal electrodes, but also helps characterize electrode materials in a reliable way.

An atomistically informed mesoscale model for growth and coarsening during discharge in lithium-oxygen batteries	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LI-O-2; PEROXIDE; DISPROPORTIONATION; CLUSTERS; LI2O2; MORPHOLOGY; STABILITY; ADDITIVES	An atomistically informed mesoscale model is developed for the deposition of a discharge product in a Li-O-2 battery. This mescocale model includes particle growth and coarsening as well as a simplified nucleation model. The model involves LiO2 formation through reaction of O-2(-) and Li+ in the electrolyte, which deposits on the cathode surface when the LiO2 concentration reaches supersaturation in the electrolyte. A reaction-diffusion (rate-equation) model is used to describe the processes occurring in the electrolyte and a phase-field model is used to capture microstructural evolution. This model predicts that coarsening, in which large particles grow and small ones disappear, has a substantial effect on the size distribution of the LiO2 particles during the discharge process. The size evolution during discharge is the result of the interplay between this coarsening process and particle growth. The growth through continued deposition of LiO2 has the effect of causing large particles to grow ever faster while delaying the dissolution of small particles. The predicted size evolution is consistent with experimental results for a previously reported cathode material based on activated carbon during discharge and when it is at rest, although kinetic factors need to be included. The approach described in this paper synergistically combines models on different length scales with experimental observations and should have applications in studying other related discharge processes, such as Li2O2 deposition, in Li-O-2 batteries and nucleation and growth in Li-S batteries.

Materials & methods: Fatty liver models of methionine-and choline-deficient high-fat mice were subjected to I/R injury with or without 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)/sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) treatment. Levels of hepatic enzymes, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines and heme oxygenase (HO)-1, and the carbon monoxide (CO) in the liver, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines and members of the signaling pathway in isolated Kupffer were assessed. Results: Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, the number of necrotic areas, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance content, TUNEL-positive cells, infiltrated macrophages, and the inflammatory cytokine expression after I/R injury were dramatically decreased, whereas the endogenous CO concentrations and the HO-1 expression were significantly increased by 5-ALA/SFC treatment. The expression of toll-like receptors 2 and 4, NF-kappa B and inflammatory cytokines and ROS production in Kupffer cells were significantly decreased with 5-ALA/SFC treatment. Conclusion: 5-ALA/SFC significantly attenuates the injury level in the fatty liver after I/R injury. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Different doses of CCl4 dissolved in vegetable oil (1 : 1, V/V) were injected via pectoral muscle to induce acute liver injury model in chickens. An herbal formula, Longyin decoction, was prepared for hepatoprotection test on chicken acute liver injury models. The pathologic changes of the liver were observed, and the activities of ALT and AST were, respectively, detected to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of Longyin decoction on chickens. The chicken acute liver injury model was successfully established by injecting CCl4 via pectoral muscle. The best dose of CCl4 inducing chicken liver injury was 4.0 mL/kG.BW (body weight). The results of qualitative determination by HPTLC showed that the components of Longyin decoction contained Gentian, Capillaries, Gardenia, and Bupleurum root. In the high-dose Longyin group and the middle-dose Longyin group, the pathological changes of the damaged liver were mitigated and the activities of ALT and AST in serum were reduced significantly. Longyin decoction has obvious hepatoprotective effect on acute liver injury induced by CCl4.

The closure process of the voids was observed using roll-bonding tests of 304 stainless steel/Q235 carbon steel. A finite element model was built to simulate the macroscopic deformation process of 304/Q235 material, and a molecular dynamics model established to simulate the deformation process of the microscopic rough peaks. The closure law and mechanism of interface voids at the macro- and micro-scales were studied. The results show that the closure rate of interface voids decreases with the decrease in the average contact stress during the contact deformation process. In the atomic bonding process, the void closure rate is slow in the elastic deformation process. The ordered atoms near the interface become disordered as plastic deformation occurs, which increases the void closure rate and hinders dislocation propagation through the interface, resulting in significant strengthening effects via plastic deformation. Ultimately, a perfect lattice is reconstructed with void healing. In addition, the interface morphology after roll-bonding at the macro scale was determined by the morphology of the 304 steel with larger yield strength ratio, while the interface morphology at the micro-scale was mainly determined by the morphology of the Q235 steel with a higher yield strength.

However, commercialization of the Li anode has been hampered by the safety issue associated with Li-dendrite growth resulting from uneven Li-ion deposition and an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, an in situ prepared 10 nm thin film of covalent organic framework (COF) uniformly covered on the Li anode (COF-Li) is used as an artificial SEI layer for Li plating/striping stabilization and Li dendrite inhibition. Abundant microcellular structures in the COF can redistribute the Li-ion flux and lead to the homogeneous plating/stripping process. Meanwhile, the superhard mechanical properties and mechanical behavior during needling of the ultrathin COF film is studied via the digital pulsed force mode equipped in atomic force microscopy, illustrating a high Young's modulus of 6.8 GPa that is strong enough to resist dendrite growth. As a result, stable cycling for 400 h is achieved in the COF-Li symmetrical cell at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2), and the internal short circuit is effectively blocked by COF-Li in Li-S batteries.

Li-S batteries have high theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g(-1), thanks to conversion reaction from solid sulphur to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Unfortunately, few issues are still hindering their commercialization. The main problem afflicting lithium sulphur batteries is the shuttle phenomenon, due to soluble long chain LiPSs generated at the cathode. In the last years, many interlayer separators have been based on materials showing physical blocking of LiPSs. In particular, MoS2 and PANI separately showed strong adsorption capability, preventing polysulfides dissolution and accelerating the redox reaction kinetics. In the present work we rationally design, for the first time, composite materials based on PANI and MoS2, with the aim to evaluate the specific role of each component and their synergy as LiPSs blocking-agents, by implementation of a second layer containing the MoS2/PANI composite directly on the top of the standard S/C electrode. The systematic study confirms that double-layer containing the composite remarkably improves the performance of the sulphur cathode, showing specific capacity close to 600 mAh g(-1), which is 42% higher than the standard sulphur cathode, after 500 cycles.

The effects of hydrothermal temperature (140, 160, 180 and 200 degrees C) on the crystal phase, morphology, specific surface area and porous properties, surface element composition, optical response properties of the resultant samples were investigated in detail, and the photocatalytic activities of these obtained CTNP samples for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) were evaluated under visible light irradiation. The results showed that precursor cubic TiC was transformed into anatase TiO2 with the morphology of well-defined nanoplate completely after hydrothermal treatment for 30 h. The specific surface area of CTNP was significantly improved in comparison with that of micrometer sized C-doped TiO2 plates (CTP) due to smaller particle size. Due to C-doping, CTNP presented red-shift absorption edge, which supported it with strong visible-light response. All these factors led to as-prepared CTNP having more excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity in comparison with micrometer sized CTP. The CTNP synthesized at 180 degrees C presented the optimal visible-light photocatalytic activity with a high reaction rate constant (0.03692 min(-1)) among the four CTNP samples. Based on the results of the present study, a reasonable mechanism of photocatalysis on CTNP under visible light was proposed.

On the other hand, in order to further improve the electrochemical cell per-formances, understanding of the Li-Se cell working mechanism, especially focusing on the formation of dissolved Li polyselenides, is essential. In this work, an in-situ study of intermediate polyselenide forma-tion based on the 4-electrode cycling voltammetry (CV) and 3-electrode electrochemical impedance spec-troscopy (EIS) are used to detect the existence of polyselenides in carbonate and ether-based electrolytes. CV measurements reveal the presence of dissolved polyselenide intermediate formations in ether-based solvent while no signatures are observed in carbonate-based electrolytes. Similar findings are also ob-served by EIS measurements as well as investigating the self-discharge behavior. Therefore, these two electrochemical characterizations can be easily implemented as prompt and cost-effective techniques to investigate the impact of the electrolyte solvents. Contrary to the Li-S counterparts, the outcome of the work suggests that carbonate-based electrolytes can be simply employed in the field of Li-Se batteries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Stone-Wales defects in silicene: Formation, stability, and reactivity of defect sites	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							GRAPHENE; CHEMISORPTION	During the synthesis of ultrathin materials with hexagonal lattice structure Stone-Wales (SW) type of defects are quite likely to be formed and the existence of such topological defects in the graphenelike structures results in dramatic changes of their electronic and mechanical properties. Here we investigate the formation and reactivity of such SW defects in silicene. We report the energy barrier for the formation of SW defects in freestanding (similar to 2.4 eV) and Ag(111)-supported (similar to 2.8 eV) silicene and found it to be significantly lower than in graphene (similar to 9.2 eV). Moreover, the buckled nature of silicene provides a large energy barrier for the healing of the SW defect and therefore defective silicene is stable even at high temperatures. Silicene with SW defects is semiconducting with a direct band gap of 0.02 eV and this value depends on the concentration of defects. Furthermore, nitrogen substitution in SW-defected silicene shows that the defect lattice sites are the least preferable substitution locations for the N atoms. Our findings show the easy formation of SW defects in silicene and also provide a guideline for band gap engineering in silicene-based materials through such defects.

The number of CFRP layers (ranging from one to four), strengthening schemes (single-sided and double-sided bonding), and temperatures (ranging from 25 to 120 degrees C) were investigated. Results showed that the number of CFRP layers and strengthening schemes had insignificant effects on failure modes of specimens. The failure modes were dominated by the degradation of resin matrix at temperatures lower than T-g + 10 or 20 degrees C, where T-g is the glass transition temperature, and were dominated by the volume decrease of resin matrix at temperatures above that. Through bonding CFRP sheets, the ultimate load and post-elastic stiffness of specimens were significantly increased. However, the increase in the number of CFRP layers also led to the decrease in strengthening and stiffening efficiency. The double-sided strengthened specimens showed more preferable mechanical properties than the single-sided strengthened specimens. As temperature increased, significant decreases in ultimate load and post-elastic stiffness were observed. Analytical modeling to predict the mechanical properties at ambient and elevated temperatures were conducted, respectively. The modeling results were verified by the test data.

Efficient suppression of the shuttle effect in Na-S batteries with an As2S3 anchoring monolayer	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES; CELL CHEMISTRY; PERFORMANCE; CATHODES; POLYSULFIDES; CONSTANTS; GRAPHENE; SURFACE	Sodium-sulfur batteries (NaSBs) have emerged as a promising energy storage technology for large-scale stationary applications such as smart electrical grids due to their exceptionally high energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, one of the challenging problems impeding their practical applications is the sulfur shuttle effect by which the active redox intermediates are gradually dissolved in electrolytes. In this work, we have employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to unravel the suppression of the shuttle effect in NaSBs with a two-dimensional (2D) As2S3 monolayer as the anchoring material. We show that semiconducting As2S3 is a suitable anchoring layer to inhibit the dissolution of the polysulfide intermediates in common electrolytes because of its stronger chemical binding with sodium polysulfides than with the electrolytes. The immense adsorption is attributed to the electron donation from the unfilled S-3p states of the polysulfides to As2S3. These mechanisms increase the carrier population and consequently improve the electrical conductivity of As2S3. Hence, the use of As2S3 can both reduce the shuttle effect and enhance the cathode electron conductivity to enable improved cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of the battery.

However, a large volume expansion induced by Li-ion insertion limits the application of Se electrodes. In this paper, Se/NiO nanocomposites were prepared by a simple wet chemical method at a low temperature. Benefiting from the favorable macro/meso-nanosheets arrays structures, Se/NiO nanocomposites can greatly ease the capacity loss caused by volume expansion, which exhibited excellent rate performances. These results indicate that the Se/NiO nanocomposite is a promising electrode material for high performance rechargeable lithium batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The corrosion inhibition effects of the cationic dye methylene blue (MB) and the anionic dye methyl orange (MO) are tested. The test methods include electrochemical methods, weight-loss tests, and so on. MB exhibits better performance on the tested steel, with the anticorrosion efficiency reaching as high as 75.40%, which is chosen as an additive for organic corrosion inhibitors. After that, an organic inhibitor decamethylene bis-pyridinium dibromide (DBP) is selected for compounding with MB, and the corrosion inhibition effect under different ratios is tested. Similar effects of the compound inhibitor to the pristine sample are obtained at a ratio of MB/DBP = 6:4. In addition to experiments, theoretical calculations have also confirmed that the addition of dye molecules can inhibit corrosion. This research not only provides a way to reuse dye wastewater but also proposes measures to reduce the cost of organic corrosion inhibitors and, at the same time, provides new ideas for environmental protection and metal protection.

Herein, freestanding (C/S/BaTiO3)@TiO2 (CSB@TiO2) electrode with only approximate to 3 wt% of BaTiO3 additive and approximate to 4 nm thickness of amorphous TiO2 atomic layer deposition protective layer is rational designed, and first used for RT Na-S batteries. Results show that such cathode material exhibits high rate capability and excellent durability compared with pure C/S and C/S/BaTiO3 electrodes. Notably, this CSB@TiO2 electrode performs a discharge capacity of 524.8 and 382 mA h g(-1) after 1400 cycles at 1 A g(-1) and 3000 cycles at 2 A g(-1), respectively. Such superior electrochemical performance is mainly attributed from the BaTiO3-C-TiO2 synergetic structure within the matrix, which enables effectively inhibiting the shuttle effect, restraining the volumetric variation and stabilizing the ionic transport interface.

We report a very tough multifunctional artificial protective (MAP) layer formed on a Li metal anode that is ultra-stable in the normally used commercial carbonate electrolyte. The MAP layer is prepared by the in situ photopolymerization of pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA) and poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (PEGDA) in a framework of poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) incorporated with graphene oxide (GO). There are two aspects to the functionality of this MAP layer. It has excellent compatibility with the carbonate electrolyte because of the similar chemical structure of the ester group, giving it a high ionic conductivity, and induces the formation of a unique solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) containing organic components and LiF, which has a good chemical stability with the carbonate liquid electrolyte to suppress Li dendrite growth and side reactions. A symmetric battery with the MAP coated Li (MAP-Li) anode steadily cycles for over 1100 h at 1 mA cm(-2) in a carbonate liquid electrolyte. The work provides a way to obtain a stable Li metal anode in a practical carbonate electrolyte.

However, aqueous chloride-ion redox materials are limitedly reported owing to their instability or dissolution in aqueous electrolyte. Here, we synthetize a new electrochemical chloride-ion material, Sb4O5Cl2, investigate its electrochemical performance in aqueous NaCl electrolyte, and assemble into aqueous chloride-ion battery with silver as cathode. During the battery charge process, Sb4O5Cl2 anode electrochemically releases chloride ions, which are captured by Ag cathode with the formation of silver chloride while the discharging reverses the process. The battery demonstrates favorable electrochemical performance. With current density of 600 mA g(-1), the battery discharge capacity of 34.6 mAh g(-1) can be maintained for 50 cycles. This work is greatly significant for the development of anion electrochemical energy storage.

Despite plenty of researches on MWNT based delivery systems, precision-guided assistances to maximize their profitable properties are still lacking in substantive progress. We developed here a dual-targeting and co-delivery system based on MWNT for antiangiogenesis therapy in lung cancer which aimed at renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysregulation by synergistically conducting angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) and type 2 receptor (AT(2)R) pathway. In this work, iRGD peptide connected to polyethyleneimine (PEI) was linked to MWNT skeleton, accompanying with candesartan (CD) conjugated to MWNT mediated by cystamine (SS). The functionalized MWNT is assembled with plasmid AT(2) (pAT(2)) to form iRGD-PEI-MWNT-SS-CD/pAT(2) complexes. iRGD and CD act as pilots for complexes to dually target symbolic alpha v beta 3-integrin and AT1R both overexpressed on tumor angiogenic endothelium and lung cancer cell. CD as chemotherapy showed synergistic downregulation of VEGF when combining of pAT(2) and efficiently inhibited angiogenesis. iRGD-PEI-MWNT-SS-CD/pAT(2) complexes greatly appreciated drug activities by changing drug distribution and exhibited remarkable tumor growth suppression in A549 xenograft nude mice. Our work presents that such dual-targeting strategy highly improves the delivery performance of MWNT and open a new avenue for RAS related lung cancer therapy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Advantages of nitrogen fertilizer deep placement in greenhouse gas emissions and net ecosystem economic benefits from no-tillage paddy fields	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Agricultural input; Carbon footprint; CH4 flux; Economic benefit; N deep placement	ORGANIC-CARBON FRACTIONS; IRRIGATED RICE FIELDS; METHANE EMISSIONS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; N2O EMISSIONS; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; OXIDE EMISSIONS; WHEAT ROTATION; USE EFFICIENCY	Unreasonable application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers gives rise to agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, causing increases in carbon footprint (CF). To solve such problems, scholars have proposed the practice of N deep placement (DPN), which has been proven to be an effective approach to enhance N use efficiency and reduce N loss. However, the effect of DPN on CF and net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) from no-tillage (NT) rice fields remains largely unknown. In this work, a field experiment was conducted with a random complete block design to investigate the differences in soil CH4 and N2O emissions, agricultural GHG emissions, grain yield, CF, and NEEB from NT paddy fields between urea deep placement (UDP) and urea broadcasting (UBC) in central China. The CF for the entire rice production chain can be calculated as the ratio of total GHG emissions to grain yield using a life-cycle approach. The novelty of this study lies in the examination of the integrated effects of DPN on GHG emissions, grain yield, CF and NEEB from NT paddy fields. The agricultural GHG emissions varied from 1297.0 to 1420.8 kg CO2-eq ha(-1). Chemical fertilizers dominated the GHG emissions. UDP resulted in 96.8 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) more emissions than UBC due to more consumption of diesel by machinery operations. Compared with UBC, UDP significantly reduced soil CH4 emissions by 36-39% and N2O emissions by 29-31%. The mitigation of soil CH4 and N2O emissions under UDP decreased the total GHG emissions by 34% and CF by 46%. Soil CH4 emissions accounted for 83-88% of the total GHG emissions. The NEEB under UDP was 48% higher than that under UBC. In conclusion, DPN can increase grain yield, reduce CF, and enhance NEEB from NT rice fields, and may be an economic and cleaner approach for rice production. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the instability of Zn anode caused by dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution, and side reactions has greatly hampered its commercialization. Herein, an in situ grown ZnSe overlayer is crafted over one side of commercial Zn foil via chemical vapor deposition in a scalable manner, aiming to achieve optimized electrolyte/Zn interfaces with large-scale viability. Impressively, thus-derived ZnSe coating functions as a cultivator to guide oriented growth of Zn (002) plane at the infancy stage of stripping/plating cycles, thereby inhibiting the formation of Zn dendrites and the occurrence of side reactions. As a result, high cyclic stability (1530 h at 1.0 mA cm(-2)/1.0 mAh cm(-2); 172 h at 30.0 mA cm(-2)/10.0 mAh cm(-2)) in symmetric cells is harvested. Meanwhile, when paired with V2O5 based cathode, assembled full cell achieves an outstanding capacity (194.5 mAh g(-1)) and elongated lifespan (a capacity retention of 84% after 1000 cycles) at 5.0 A g(-1). The reversible Zn anode enabled by the interfacial manipulation strategy via ZnSe cultivator is anticipated to satisfy the demand of commercial use.

Lightning Strike Ablation Damage Influence Factors Analysis of Carbon Fiber/Epoxy Composite Based on Coupled Electrical-Thermal Simulation	APPLIED COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						Carbonfiber/epoxycomposite; Lightning strike ablation damage; Influence factors; Coupled electrical-thermal simulation	AIRCRAFT; STRENGTH	According to the mathematical analysis model constructed on the basis of energy-balance relationship in lightning strike, and accompany with the simplified calculation strategy of composite resin pyrolysis degree dependent electrical conductivity, an effective three dimensional thermal-electrical coupling analysis finite element model of composite laminate suffered from lightning current was established based on ABAQUS, to elucidate the effects of lighting current waveform parameters and thermal/electrical properties of composite laminate on the extent of ablation damage. Simulated predictions agree well with the composite lightning strike directed effect experimental data, illustrating the potential accuracy of the constructed model. The analytical results revealed that extent of composite lightning strike ablation damage can be characterized by action integral validly, there exist remarkable power function relationships between action integral and visual damage area, projected damage area, maximum damage depth and damage volume of ablation damage, and enhancing the electrical conductivity and specific heat of composite, ablation damage will be descended obviously, power function relationships also exist between electrical conductivity, specific heat and ablation damage, however, the impact of thermal conductivity on the extent of ablation damage is not notable. The conclusions obtained provide some guidance for composite anti-lightning strike structure-function integration design.	[Yin, J. J.; Chang, F.; Li, S.

His scientific works have been devoted to the concepts and technologies of today's batteries, in particular, mastering research on electrodes and electrolytes. With respect to innovative discoveries, Michel had several scientific breakthroughs from the description of the solid-solution electrode and rocking-chair battery to the applications of novel materials utilized in all-solid-state batteries (SSBs); these refer to Li-ion, Na-ion, Li-S, and Li-air cells. At a young age, he formalized the concept of electrochemical intercalation and fabricated the first SSB with sodium-intercalated graphite as the electrode in 1972. Subsequently, he led the use of solid polymer electrolytes and developed lithium-metal-polymer batteries with vanadium oxide as the cathode in 1978. Michel successfully conducted research in new salts topics based on delocalized anions of the sulfonimide family in 1986; his research areas included 1) organic electrode materials, i.e., innovations in redox-active organics, which included poly quinones and aromatic dicarboxylates, and 2) carbon "nano painting" process that has made LiFePO4@C the safest cathode in 2002. Because Michel has co-authored over 500 publications and many patents, it is impractical to fully review his outstanding contributions in electrochemistry in this work. This work is limited to a few of his contributions pertaining to the evolution of electrochemical energy storage. We further discussed different routes envisioned for further progress in rechargeable batteries. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

J	Li, Q; Zhu, SP; Lu, YY				Li, Qi; Zhu, Shoupu; Lu, Yingying			3D Porous Cu Current Collector/Li-Metal Composite Anode for Stable Lithium-Metal Batteries	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article							SULFUR BATTERIES; RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES; DENDRITE GROWTH; POWDER ANODE; ELECTROLYTES; GRAPHENE; CARBON; PERFORMANCE; DEPOSITION; BEHAVIOR	Lithium-metal batteries are of particular interest for next-generation electrical energy storage because of their high energy density on both volumetric and gravimetric bases. Effective strategies to stabilize the Li-metal anode are the prerequisite for the progress of these exceptional storage technologies, such as Li-S and Li-O-2 batteries. Various challenges, such as uneven Li electro-deposition, anode volume expansion, and dendrite-induced short-circuit have hindered the practical application of rechargeable Li-metal batteries. Herein, a one-step facile and cost-effective strategy for stabilizing lithium-metal batteries via 3D porous Cu current collector/Li-metal composite anode is reported. The porous structure of the composite electrode provides a "cage" for the redeposition of "hostless" lithium and accommodates the anode volume expansion during cycling. Compared with planar Cu foil, its high specific surface area favors the electrochemical reaction kinetics and lowers the local current density along the anode. It leads to low interfacial resistance and stabilizes the Li electrodeposition. On this basis, galvanostatic measurements are performed on both symmetric cells and Li/Li4Ti5O12 cells and it is found that the electrodes exhibit exceptional abilities of promoting cell lifetime and stabilizing the cycling behavior. Although this work focuses on lithium metal, this novel tactic is easy to generalize to other metal electrodes.

Nevertheless, the practical applications of the Li anode have been hampered because of its low Coulombic efficiency and safety hazards. Here, acid-treated g-C3N4 with O- and N-containing groups are coated on Li foil through a facile physical pressing method. The O- and N-containing groups cooperate to rearrange the concentration of Li ions and enhance the Li ion transfer. Hence, the cycle and rate performances of acid-treated g-C3N4-coated Li electrodes are greatly improved in symmetric cells, which show cycling stability over 400 h at 1 mA cm(-2) in ester-based electrolytes and over 2100 h in ether-based electrolytes. As for the Li//LiFePO4 full cells, there is a high capacity retention of 80% over 400 cycles at 1 C. The full cells of Li//S in ether-based electrolytes also exhibit a capacity of 520 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles at 1 C.

We report a kinetics-controlled reaction for the synthesis of bimetallic organic frameworks. Furthermore, uniform ZnCoS@CoS yolk-shell structures were fabricated via sulfidation and then converted to ZnCoS@Co9S8/N-doped carbon single-holed hollow core-shell structures by calcination under nitrogen. Such a core-shell structure effectively withstands the dramatic volume change and inhibits the aggregation of metal nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the N-doped porous carbon offers fast electron transport to achieve exceptionally high rate capability.

Conversion of solid carbonaceous fuels in a fluidized bed fuel cell	ELECTROCHEMICAL AND SOLID STATE LETTERS			English	Article							DIRECT-OXIDATION; ANODES; CHAINS; HYDROCARBONS; PERFORMANCE; SOFCS	A fluidized bed direct carbon fuel cell was employed to achieve direct conversion of solid fuels into electricity. Power was generated from pulverized Lower Kittanning (bituminous) coal, synthetic carbon, and biomass in a single process step. Current-voltage characteristics exhibited typical fuel cell behavior. Fluidization in flowing CO2 overcomes the difficulty of attaining solid fuel-to-anode contact and generates CO in situ via the Boudouard reaction. A mechanistic reaction pathway is proposed for anodic oxidation of the solid fuel. Conversion was verified by gas analysis of oxidation products in the flue stream and by oxygen mass balance. c 2007 The Electrochemical Society.

By increasing the numerical aperture of optical focusing, the lateral resolution of OR-PAM can be improved; however, the depth of focus and thus the imaging range will be sacrificed correspondingly. In this work, we report our development of blind-deconvolution optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (BD-PAM) that can provide a lateral resolution similar to 2-fold finer than that of conventional OR-PAM (3.04 vs. 5.78 mu m), without physically increasing the system's numerical aperture. The improvement achieved with BD-PAM is demonstrated by imaging graphene nanoparticles and the microvasculature of mice ears in vivo. Our results suggest that BD-PAM may become a valuable tool for many biomedical applications that require both fine spatial resolution and extended depth of focus.

In this study, S-Co-O tridoped g-C3N4 nanorods with outstanding visible light activity under anoxic conditions are synthesized via hydrothermal post-treatment. S and Co doping inhibits the crystal growth of graphitic carbon nitride, enhances the S-BET, decreases the band gap energy and increases the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes, which increases the anoxic photocatalytic RhB degradation constants by approximately 4.5 times. After hydrothermal treatment, oxygen doping not only increases the adsorption ability of graphitic carbon nitride but also captures photogenerated electrons to produce photogenerated holes for RhB degradation under anoxic conditions, leading to a tripling of the RhB degradation constant. This study provides new insight into the design and fabrication of oxygen-free photocatalysts.

J	Snyder, CW				Snyder, Carolyn W.			Revised estimates of paleoclimate sensitivity over the past 800,000 years	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; GLACIAL CYCLES; OCEAN TEMPERATURE; STATE DEPENDENCY; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ICE-CORE; CO2; EVOLUTION; FUTURE; AGE	This study evaluates paleoclimate sensitivity over the past 800,000 years from proxy-based reconstructions of changes in global temperature, ice sheets and sea level, vegetation, dust, and greenhouse gases. This analysis uses statistical methods that are not biased by the variable (heteroscedastic) uncertainty in the reconstructions, and applies a Monte Carlo-style probabilistic framework to quantify several sources of measurement and structural uncertainty. Not addressing the heteroscedastic uncertainty would result in regression results that underestimate paleoclimate sensitivity by over 30%, and not using a probabilistic framework could underestimate the credible interval by fivefold. A comparison of changes in global temperature (Delta T) and changes in radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, ice sheets, dust, and vegetation (Delta R-[GHG,R-LI,R-AE,R-VG]) over the past 800 kyr finds that the two are closely coupled across glacial cycles with a correlation of 0.81 (0.6 to 0.9, 95% credible interval). The variation of Delta T with Delta R over the past 800 kyr is non-linear, with lower correlation and lower responsiveness at colder temperatures. The paleoclimate sensitivity parameter estimates (S-[GHG,S-LI,S-AE,S-VG]) are 0.84 degrees C/W/m(2) (0.20 to 1.9 degrees C/W/m(2), 95% interval) for interglacial periods and intermediate glacial climates and 0.53 degrees C/W/m(2) (0.08 to 1.5 degrees C/W/m(2), 95% interval) for full glacial climates, 37% lower at the median. The estimates of S-[GHG,S-LI,S-AE,S-VG] and the pattern of state dependence are similar across glacial cycles over the past 800 kyr. This analysis explicitly includes several sources of uncertainty and is still able to provide a strong upper bound for the paleoclimate sensitivity parameter for interglacial periods and intermediate glacial climates: over 1.5 degrees C/W/m(2) is < 10% probability, 1.7 degrees C/W/m(2) is < 5% probability, and over 1.9 degrees C/W/m(2) is < 2.5% probability.

However, few researches have documented the effects of ecological projects on the improvement of ecosystem services of alpine grasslands based on field investigations. In this study, 24 plots of alpine meadow along different succession times were investigated to estimate the impacts of ecological restoration on four key ecosystem services (i.e., soil organic carbon sequestration (SOCS), soil total nitrogen sequestration (STNS), biodiversity, and aboveground biomass) in the Glog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, China. The results showed that STNS and biodiversity of degraded alpine meadows were significantly improved through restoration actions, while SOCS and aboveground biomass didn't change. The relationships of above- and belowground ecosystem services changed over restoration time. Trade-offs between aboveground biomass and biodiversity, between aboveground biomass and SOCS at stage III were significantly improved, in contrast to those at stage I. Trade-off between STNS and biodiversity at stage II was significantly increased, in contrast to those at stage I. Economic profit of ecological restoration was insignificantly changed along restoration time. Our results suggested that human-induced restoration was a feasible approach to improve the ecological and economical values of "Black Beach" on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and further restoration actions and long-term research are required to enhance the ecosystem services of revegetated degraded meadow.

Conventional synthesis is energy intensive and costly, and offers limited size control. Here we describe a scalable approach wherein Li2S is formed by contacting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas with metalorganic solution at ambient temperature. NCs are recovered with essentially 100% yield in a subsequent evaporation step. Control of NC size and uniformity is demonstrated through manipulating parameters such as precursor concentration and solvent evaporation rate. A suite of complementary techniques confirm the production of anhydrous, phase-pure Li2S nanocrystals with tunable size (5-20 nm) and narrow particle size distributions. Mild annealing conditions are identified to provide the purity necessary for battery applications, while retaining the original size distribution. Simple cathodes fabricated from the resulting NCs show promising battery performance, where the capacity approaches the theoretical value and displays good cyclability and rate capability.

Scaffolds show favorable highly interconnected and macroporous structure through a high foaming pressure and long venting time foaming strategy. Specifically, scaffolds with porosity from 73% to 85%, pore size from 120 mu m to 320 mu m and interconnectivity of over 95% are controllably fabricated at MBG content from 0 wt% to 20 wt%. In comparison with neat PLGA scaffolds, composite scaffolds perform improved strength (up to 1.5 folds) and Young's modulus (up to 3 folds). The interconnected macroporous structure is beneficial to the ingrowth of cells. More importantly, composite scaffolds also provide a more promising microenvironment for cellular proliferation and adhesion with the release of bioactive ions. Hopefully, MBG/PLGA scaffolds developed by the green foaming strategy in this work show promising morphological, mechanical and biological features for tissue regeneration.

In this work, hydroxyphenolphthalein type polyetherketone grafted carboxy carbon nanotube (PEK-C-OH-g-MWCNTs-COOH) composites were prepared by esterification reaction. The composites exhibited good thermal conductivity, and compared with (MWCNTs-COOH/PEEK) with randomly distributed fillers, (PEK-C-OH-g-MWCNTs-COOH) composites showed a significant advantage, with the same carbon nanotube content, the thermal conductivity of PEK-C-OH-g-MWCNTs-COOH/PEEK (30 wt%) was 0. 71 W/(m-K), which was 206% higher than that of PEEK and 0.52 W/(m-K) higher than that of MWCNTs-COOH/PEEK (26.1 wt%). In addition, the PEK-C-OH-g-MWCNTs-COOH) composite exhibited excellent electrical conductivity and electromagnetic shielding (SE). The SE of 30 wt% PEK-C-OH-g-MWCNTs-COOH/PEEK is higher than the commercially used standard whose value is 22.9 dB (8.2 GHz). Thus, this work provides ideas for the development of thermally conductive functionalized composites.

Bryophytes, which are extremely vulnerable to N deposition, often play essential roles in these cycles by contributing to large nutrient pools in boreal and montane forest ecosystems. To interpret the sensitivity of epiphytic bryophytes for N deposition and to determine their critical load (CL) in a subtropical montane cloud forest, community-level, physiological and chemical responses of epiphytic bryophytes were tested in a 2-year field experiment of N additions. The results showed a significant decrease in the cover of the bryophyte communities at an N addition level of 7.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), which is consistent with declines in the biomass production, vitality, and net photosynthetic rate responses of two dominant bryophyte species. Given the background N deposition rate of 10.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the study site, a CL of N deposition is therefore estimated as ca. 18 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). A disordered cellular carbon (C) metabolism, including photosynthesis inhibition and ensuing chlorophyll degradation, due to the leakage of magnesium and potassium and corresponding downstream effects, along with direct toxic effects of excessive N additions is suggested as the main mechanism driving the decline of epiphytic bryophytes. Our results confirmed the process of C metabolism and the chemical stability of epiphytic bryophytes are strongly influenced by N addition levels; when coupled to the strong correlations found with the loss of bryophytes, this study provides important and timely evidence on the response mechanisms of bryophytes in an increasingly N-polluted world. In addition, this study underlines a general decline in community heterogeneity and biomass production of epiphytic bryophytes induced by increasing N deposition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

An additional heat accelerates the rate of the solvent evaporation for accomplishing the self-assembly process of the surfactant. Interestingly, it only takes about 7 min for the preparation of polymer by using this facile HISA. The tedious prepolymerization process between phenol and resorcinol can be saved by directly mixing them together in the system, and the subsequent thermal consolidation process at 100 degrees C for about 24 h in the usual method can also be eliminated. Meanwhile, evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and hydrothermal (HT) approaches have also been employed to prepare the porous carbon in F127/MMA reverse microemulsion. Hierarchically porous carbon materials prepared by using reverse microemulsion as the electrode of supercapacitors exhibit an excellent performance in electrochemical application. Hierarchically porous organosilica materials and Si/C nanocomposites have also been prepared in the reverse microemulsion by utilizing HISA, which indicates the universality of this versatile approach. This general approach can provide a facile and sustainable route to construct the architecture of hierarchically porous materials for various applications.

However, the poor cyclability and low capacity utilization of sulphur materials remain a great challenge for battery applications. To overcome this problem, we proposed a new strategy to convert the redox chemistry of sulphur cathodes from the dissolution-deposition mechanism to a solid-phase conversion (SPC) reaction by in situ formation of a thin and compact solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the sulphur surface through a prompt nucleophilic reaction of soluble polysulfide intermediates with carbonate molecules specially designed as a co-solvent in the electrolyte. The such-formed SEI film can effectively block the penetration of the electrolyte but allows Li+ transport for electrochemical conversion, thus completely suppressing the generation and dissolution of polysulfide intermediates without sacrificing the two-electron redox capacity of sulphur. As a result, the S/C cathode in a VC/DME + DOL co-solvent electrolyte demonstrated a stable cycling capacity of approximate to 1100 mA h g(-1) and a high capacity retention of 88% over 400 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of approximate to 100%, showing a prospect for battery application. More significantly, the strategy and method developed in this work may provide a new insight for future development of structurally and electrochemically stable sulphur cathodes for building practically viable Li-S batteries.

J	Eftekhari, A				Eftekhari, Ali			Energy efficiency: a critically important but neglected factor in battery research	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							ELECTRODE MATERIAL; CATHODE MATERIALS; REDUCED GRAPHENE; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; CARBON; OXIDE; ANODE; COMPOSITE; BINDER	In fundamental studies of electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and similar energy storage systems, the main focus is on the capacity, rate capability, and cyclability. The efficiency is usually judged by the coulombic efficiency indicating the electrochemical reversibility. As practical measures, power and energy densities are calculated for discharging, but less attention (if any) is paid to the energy efficiency. Although in the past the energy efficiency was almost close to unity for all electrode materials of LIBs, this factor is critically important for new high-density materials (e.g., based on conversion mechanism) since the energy density can be way below the requirements for the practical development. In fact, a low energy density is due to high overpotentials and is an essential part of the basic research for the material design because it cannot be improved during commercialisation. In large-scale energy storage devices such as batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) or household energy storage systems, the cost of energy consumed to charge the battery is a significant factor and is directly translated into the cost of the energy supplied by the storage device. The present paper clarifies how neglecting the energy efficiency has caused a fraction of research on LIBs to go astray in developing new electrode materials, which are not of practical interest because of huge overpotentials. Particular attention is given to conversion-based electrode materials, which are the common candidates for anode materials of lithiumion batteries and cathode materials of lithium-sulphur (Li-S) and similar batteries. Furthermore, the impact of nanostructures is considered.

However, exclusive NH4+ may causes toxicity to crops. Transcriptomics in conjunction with metabolomics analysis in allotetraploid rapeseed under NH4+ stress showed that NH4+ taken up by roots was mainly transferred to leaves for assimilation. The concentrations of most amino acids, glucose, and glucose-6-phosphate increased whilst malate, succinate, and alpha-ketoglutarate concentrations decreased in NH4+-treated leaves. Moreover, NH4+ toxicity down-regulated genes related to photosynthesis and impaired the electron transport chain in chloroplasts. The expression of genes related to H2O2 decomposition, as well as the concentrations of monodehydro-ascorbic acid and ascorbic acid, reduced after exposure to NH4+-N, accompanied by higher O2 center dot - and H2O2 accumulation. Taken together, our results indicated that the excessive accumulation of NH4+ in plants caused an imbalance of carbon and N metabolism, impaired photosystems and generated reactive oxygen species, which resulted in toxicity to rapeseed.

Biochars were physicochemical characterized in order to evaluate the pyrolysis-induced effects in terms of both functional groups and material structure. Moreover, such carbonaceous materials were tested as adsorbent substrates for the removal of target molecules from aqueous environment as well as in solid-gas experiments, to measure the adsorption capacities and selectivity toward CO2. Lastly, biochars were also investigated as possible cathode materials in sustainable and low-cost electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries.

However, flexible and robust separator with high ionic conductivity and thermal stability is also eagerly anticipated for advanced secondary batteries. Here porous polyurethane@graphene oxide (PU@GO) membranes prepared by electrospun technique have been developed as ideal separator candidates for high-performance LIBs. Electrolyte-uptake capacity and ionic conductivity of the flexible PU@GO separators are superior to those of commercial Celgard separators at 733% and 3.73 mS cm(-1), respectively, resulting in better battery performances in terms of impedance, specific discharge capacity and cycle life.

J	Chen, M; Li, S; Feng, G				Chen, Ming; Li, Song; Feng, Guang			The Influence of Anion Shape on the Electrical Double Layer Microstructure and Capacitance of Ionic Liquids-Based Supercapacitors by Molecular Simulations	MOLECULES			English	Article						supercapacitor model; ion shape; carbon electrode; interfacial structure; capacitance	DIFFERENTIAL CAPACITANCE; CARBON	Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are an emerging class of electrolytes for supercapacitors. In this work, we investigate the effects of different supercapacitor models and anion shape on the electrical double layers (EDLs) of two different RTILs: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([Emim][Tf2N]) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium 2-(cyano)pyrrolide ([Emim][CNPyr]) by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The EDL microstructure is represented by number densities of cations and anions, and the potential drop near neutral and charged electrodes reveal that the supercapacitor model with a single electrode has the same EDL structure as the model with two opposite electrodes. Nevertheless, the employment of the one-electrode model without tuning the bulk density of RTILs is more time-saving in contrast to the two-electrode one. With the one-electrode model, our simulation demonstrated that the shapes of anions significantly imposed effects on the microstructure of EDLs. The EDL differential capacitance vs. potential (C-V) curves of [Emim][CNPyr] electrolyte exhibit higher differential capacitance at positive potentials. The modeling study provides microscopic insight into the EDLs structure of RTILs with different anion shapes.

Compared to the FM treatment, the RM treatment significantly decreased the microbial biomass C (MBC) content, water soluble organic C content in the 0-20 cm layer and extractable organic C content in 2011 at milk stage (R3); however, it significantly increased the MBC content at planting time (PT) or the 6th leaf stage (V6) of the next growing season. Moreover, compared with the FM treatment, the RM treatment significantly increased the microbial biomass N content from silking stage to physiological maturity (R6) in the 0-20 cm layer and extractable organic N (EON) content at R6 in 2012; however, it significantly decreased the water soluble organic N (WSON) content at R3 and the WSON and EON contents at PT or V6 of the next growing season. Thus, plastic film mulching with film removal during the maize reproductive stages could be an excellent option for maintaining soil quality and improving soil N availability in the temperature- and rainfall-limited regions of northwest China.

The effects of fiber fraction on the flexural strength and fracture toughness were investigated. No preferred fiber orientation was observed on the fracture surface of the green body. This implies a homogeneous dispersion of chopped fiber in the composite. XRD analysis indicates a complete siliconization of both carbon particles and carbon fiber during liquid silicon infiltration. The flexural strength and fracture toughness increase with chopped fiber ranging from 10 vol.% to 30 vol.%. This improvement derives from the fiber pullout, fiber debonding as well as crack deflection. The consequent decline at fiber fraction of 40 vol.% is resulted from the siliconization of chopped fiber and the increase of residual silicon. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

The bubble point pressures of each system were obtained through a series of constant component expansion (CCE) experiments. Variation laws and mechanisms of multiphase boundary of heavy n-alkanes-CO2 systems were studied. As CO2 fraction increased, the bubble point pressure of heavy n-alkanes-CO2 systems increased greatly, and the bubble point pressure increased linearly with temperature. When CO2 molar fraction is less than 50%, the bubble point pressure of the heavy n-alkanes-CO2 systems decreased slightly with the increase of carbon number, and the decrease of pressure amplitude decreased with the decrease of CO2 mole fraction. When CO2 molar fraction was 75%, the bubble point pressure of different heavy n-alkane systems increased slightly with the increase of carbon number. When CO2 molar fraction was less than 50%, with the increase of the carbon number, the influence of temperature variation on the bubble point pressure of systems decreased. When CO2 molar fraction was equal to 75%, with the increase of the carbon number, the influence of temperature variation on the bubble point pressure of heavy n-alkanes-CO2 systems did not change. On the analysis of micro scale, the reason for variation laws above is that the long chains and large intermolecular interval of heavy n-alkane has ability to accommodate CO2 molecules and its chain is prone to twist.

In the seismic region, the effectiveness of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) externally bonded reinforcement is today widely recognized with respect to enhancing the behavior of RC shear walls, particularly of those not satisfying the requirements of modern seismic codes. Although a number of studies have been concentrated on the RC shear walls strengthened with FRP, the investigations on the RC shear walls strengthened with basalt FRP (BFRP) are relatively limited compared with RC shear walls strengthened with carbon FRP or glass FRP. Six RC shear wall specimens with an aspect ratio of 1.6, characterized as medium-rise, were subjected to cyclic load to investigate failure modes, displicement ductility ratio, stiffness characteristic, energy dissipation capacity, and load carrying capacity. One of them was tested without any strengthening as a reference specimen and the other five specimens were strengthened using BFRP strips with different configurations. The theoretical load carrying capacity was also calculated and compared with the test results. The test and theoretical results show that: (1) use of BFRP strips significantly improved the seismic performance of RC shear wall under cyclic load; (2) the final secant stiffness of specimens SHW1-SHW5 increased by 55.2%, 10.3%, 13.8%, 17.2%, and 37.9% compared with that of reference specimen SHWO; (3) the final cumulative dissipated energies of specimens SHW1-SHW5 increased by 37.5%, 1753%, 134.2%, 153.7%, and 95.2% compared with that of reference specimen SHWO; (4) the calculated load carrying capacity of the RC shear walls based on the Li's method showed a good agreement with the test results.

In this study, a first-principles approach is employed to reveal the reaction mechanism of an ultra-small LiI nanoparticle, represented by a Li14I14 cluster, with and without nanoconfined environment. This study is the first time to report that there are polyiodides longer than I-5(-) as intermediate products. For the free Li14I14 cluster, the super-long polyiodides (I-11(-) and I-13(-)) are observed at the deep state of charge (delithiation). However, the super-long chains are converted to a compact I-14 cluster at the end of delithiation process. The theoretical open circuit voltage between the I-14 and Li14I14 clusters exhibits three plateaus. The highest plateau corresponds to the conversion between the compact I-14 cluster and super-long chain-like polyiodides, and the wide medium-voltage plateau is attributed to the transmission between super-long chains and short chains. When the Li14I14 cluster is confined in a (14, 0) single wall carbon nanotube (weight ratio of LiI is 38%), the nanoconfined effect can change the cluster to one-dimensional LiI nanowire. The nanoconfined environment can eliminate the voltage plateau above 3 V, because the nanoconfined effect prohibits the formation of superlong polyiodides and the final charge products are I-x = 2, 3, 5 molecules.

The results showed that functionalized MWCNTs and hybrid fibers have a negative effect on the flowability of the LW-EGC. The tensile properties of the LW-EGC reinforced by PVA fibers were significantly improved by the functionalized MWCNTs. Compared with LW-EGC-R, the ultimate stress, strain, and strain energy density of LW-EGC-M2 increased by 5.67%, 155.78%, and 151.14%, respectively. The hybrid fiber has large volume fraction and high elastic modulus, which can effectively improve the tensile strength, ductility and crack control ability of LW-EGC. As per results, the optimal proportion of hybrid fibers was 0.15% functionalized MWCNTs, 2.5% PVA fiber, and 1.0% steel fiber. The microscopic observation revealed that the functionalized MWCNTs and hybrid fibers mainly played a role in improving the matrix and bridging cracks such that the LW-EGC exhibited good ductility, tensile strength, and multiple cracking behaviors. This study provides a reference for the design of LW-EGC reinforced by functionalizing MWCNTs and hybrid fibers and further explores the mechanisms of multi-scale reinforcement of LW-EGC.

In this manuscript, it is shown that the cycling ability of vanadium oxide (V2O5) aerogel cathodes can be substantially improved by using properly designed electrolytes. In particular, the electrochemical characterization of V2O5 aerogel, in combination with room-temperature ionic liquid-based electrolytes, demonstrates cycling stabilities above 600 cycles with capacity retentions higher than 80%. Furthermore, the ionic liquid-based electrolytes grant cyclability and safety in lithium-metal batteries even above room temperature.

However, the steel tube in this type of member often exhibits an inelastic outward local buckling. The use of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) can effectively suppress this outward local buckling and has shown great advantages in strengthening a new alternative structure. In this work, we conducted axial compression experiments to study the effect of slenderness ratio on the performance of circular RPCFST columns strengthened by CFRP. A total of 12 specimens were manufactured, and compression tests were conducted by varying the length of the members (800, 1200, and 1600 mm) and CFRP layers (0-3). The results showed that sufficient CFRP confinement can significantly improve the bearing capacity and ductility of the RPCFST columns. However, the confinement effect decreased with the increase in the slenderness ratio. We suggest a slenderness ratio of 40 and a three-layer CFRP-confined slender RPCFST column for engineering applications. Based on Euler's theory for unified materials, a theoretical model for the elastic and elastoplastic instabilities of slender CFRP-confined RPCFST columns was proposed, and the calculation and experimental results were in good agreement.

Single Nanotube Voltammetry: Current Fluctuations Are Due to Physical Motion of the Nanotube	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							NANOPARTICLE COLLISIONS; TUNNELING ULTRAMICROELECTRODE; ELECTROCHEMICAL DETECTION; SILVER NANOPARTICLES; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CARBON NANOTUBES; PARTICLE	Nanoimpacts of single palladium-coated carbon nano tubes on a gold substrate are studied to elucidate the origins of the fluctuation in the current-time response of the hydrogen oxidation reaction mediated at its surface. The chronoarnperometric and cyclic voltammetric responses from a single nanotube immobilized on the gold surface were compared to analogous data on a carbon substrate to determine the possible influence of substrate material on the nanotube-electrode electrical contact. No significant distinction between the gold and carbon was found, indicating in light of the considerable differences in the substrate materials' intrinsic electronic structures that it is the nanomotion of a nanotube at the electrode Surface which is likely responsible for the observed current modulation. This nanomotion creates a varying contact resistance, to which the noise in the current-time signal of the mediated reaction is. attributed. In addition, stochastic ex-situ of single adsorption nanotubes onto the gold electrode followed by careful drying of the electrode surface was found to drastically reduce the current fluctuation, again implying that a contact resistance arising from physical motion of the nanotube at the electrode is responsible for the modulation of current.

When this nanocomplex contributes to construct the electrochemical sensor (MOF-5@PGN/GCE), it presents a highly-sensitive response towards echinacoside, and the first measurement for echinacoside by electrochemistry accordingly evolves forward. The crystallization processes are investigated by FT-IR instrument and XRD analysis, as well as micro-morphology of modified materials is visible upon SEM and TEM. Adorably, a novel ratiometric sensor was progressively fabricated by encapsulating methylene blue (MB) molecules into cubic MOF-5 framewoks (MB encased MOF-5@PGN/GCE), and apart from assisting in establishing the analysis method with extreme accuracy and favorable practicality, it dose devote a wider linear scale and a lower detection limit than that MOF-5@PGN/GCE has given out. Drawn from the developed calibration curve using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique, the peak intensity ratio (I-Ech/I-MB) varies linearly with increased echinacoside concentration in the range of 3.0x10(-8) 1.0x10(-6) mol L-1 with limit of detection (LOD) reaching 1.0x10(-8) mol L-1 (S/N = 3). Additionally, the proposed assay method has been employed to detect echinacoside in real sample sliced cistanche with satisfactory results.

The study focused on the combined impact of the CO conversion ratio in the water gas shift (WGS) unit and CO2 recovery rate on component exergy destruction, plant efficiency, and energy penalty for CO2 capture. A theoretical limit for the minimal efficiency penalty for CO2 capture was also provided. It was found that total plant exergy destruction increased almost linearly with CO2 recovery rate and CO conversion ratio at low CO conversion ratios, but the exergy destruction from the WGS unit and the whole plant increased sharply when the CO conversion ratio was higher than 98.5% at the design WGS conditions, leading to a significant decrease in plant efficiency and increase in efficiency penalty for CO2 capture. When carbon capture rate was over around 70%, via a combination of around 100% CO2 recovery rate and lower CO conversion ratios, the efficiency penalty for CO2 capture was reduced. The minimal efficiency penalty for CO2 capture was estimated to be around 5.0 percentage points at design conditions in an IGCC plant with 90% carbon capture. Unlike the traditional aim of 100% CO conversion, it was recommended that extremely high CO conversion ratios should not be considered in order to decrease the energy penalty for CO2 capture and increase plant efficiency.

Factors contributing to one-electron metalloradical activation of ethene and carbon monoxide illustrated by reactions of Co(II), Rh(II), and Ir(II) porphyrins	JOURNAL OF ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						one-electron activation; group nine metallo-porphyrins; ethene and CO reduction and coupling; organo-metal thermodynamics	TRANSITION-METAL; BOND ACTIVATION; 1/1 COMPLEXES; H BONDS; RHODIUM(II); REACTIVITY; RADICALS; COBALT(II); IRIDIUM; LIGAND	Metallo-porphyrin complexes of Co(II), Rh(II), and Ir(II) are used as prototype metal-centered radicals in examining the factors that contribute to obtaining one-electron activated ethene and CO substrate adducts [M(CH2CH2)](center dot) and [M(CO)](center dot) that subsequently react on to produce complexes with reduced substrate units including M-CH2CH2-M, M-(CH2)(4)-M, M-C(O)-M, M-C(O)-C(O)-M, and M-C(O)H. Cobalt(II) and rhodium(II) complexes of the form [(por)M(CH2CH2)](center dot) and [(por)M(CO)](center dot) occur as primarily metal-centered radicals and the iridium analogs are porphyrin anion radical complexes ((por)(center dot-) Ir-III(CH2CH2), (por)(center dot-) Ir-III (CO)). Relatively small (por)Co-C bond dissociation enthalpies preclude forming any reduced substrate species. Rhodium porphyrins produce a complete set of reduced and coupled ethene and CO complexes, but iridium porphyrins only give ethene reduction and coupling products (por)Ir-CH2CH2-Ir(por) and (por)Ir-(CH2)(4)-Ir(por). Thermodynamic criteria and analysis of substrate reactions are used to guide interpretations of the observed reactivity. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Besides, the TEM results unambiguously show the homogeneous distribution of the CNTs in the matrix of SSPs while serious aggregation of the CNTs in the matrix of physically-blended-precursor. Crack-free monolithic silicon carbonitride modified by carbon nanotubes ceramic nanocomposites (CNTs-SiCN) were prepared through pyrolysis of the obtained SSP green bodies at 1000 degrees C. Due to the strong influence of polymer structure on the microstructure of final ceramics, the SSP-derived CNTs-SiCN nanocomposites clearly show the homogeneous distribution of the CNTs in the SiCN matrix while the physically-blended-precursor derived CNTs-SiCN nanocomposites exhibit serious aggregation and entangling of the CNTs in the SiCN matrix. With the same CNT content in the feed, the SSP-derived CNTs-SiCN nanocomposites possess significant improvements of electromagnetic (EM) absorbing properties compared to those from physically-blended-precursors, due to the quality of the dispersion of CNTs in the ceramic matrices.

The Fe3O4/N-rGO served as both particle electrodes and heterogeneous catalyst. The study concluded that BPA could be effectively removed via this hybrid system. The synergistic effect between the 3D electrode and EF system was discussed by comparing the performance of different functional particle electrodes. The 3D electrode system exhibited a larger specific surface area electrode, which improved the mass transfer of pollutants to electrode, and also accelerated the regeneration of Fe-II due to faster electron transfer, thereby enhancing the efficiency of EF catalysis. The EF process promotes the regeneration rate of particle electrodes and thus accelerates the 3D electrode reaction course. The parameters affecting degradation behavior of BPA were optimized. As a result, optimal removal rate of BPA and TOC was 93% and 60.5%, respectively within 90 min. The CPEs showed high catalytic performance (86.5% for BPA and 50.3% for TOC) and low catalyst loss (less than 9.5%) after 5 cycles, indicating its excellent stability and reusability. The possible mechanism of 3D heterogeneous EF was investigated by comparing the catalytic activity and center dot OH production capacity of homogeneous EF and Fenton-like. Built on the analysis of intermediates, a possible decomposition pathway of BPA was proposed.

Herein, a highly efficient CO evolution, with an evolution rate of 12.1 mu mol h(-1), is achieved from the visible-light-driven photoreduction of CO2 with H2O on a noble-metal-free CdS/Ni9S8/Al2O3 photocatalyst. The CO evolution on CdS/Ni9S8/Al2O3 is comparable to that on the noble-metal-based CdS/Pt/Al2O3 photocatalyst (10.6 mu mol h(-1)), but 11 times higher than that on the Al2O3-free CdS/Ni9S8 (1.1 mu mol h(-1)) photocatalyst. The Al2O3 support facilitates the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, CO2 adsorption and production of protons for reducing CO2, thus enhancing the CO evolution. These results will open a new door for rationally fabricating efficient noble-metal-free photocatalysts, and favor the transition to solar energy economy.

However, the relationships between rice roots and rhizosphere microbes for N utilization are still unclear. We analyzed different N forms (NH4+,NO, and dissolved organic N), microbial biomass N and C, dissolved organic C, CH4 and N(2)0 emissions, and abundance of microbial functional genes in both rhizosphere and bulk soils after 37-d rice growth in a greenhouse pot experiment. Results showed that the dissolved organic C was significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil than in the non-rhizosphere bulk soil, but microbial biomass C showed no significant difference. The concentrations of NH4+, dissolved organic N, and microbial biomass N in the rhizosphere soil were significantly lower than those of the bulk soil, whereas NO3- in the rhizosphere soil was comparable to that in the bulk soil. The CH4 and N20 fluxes from the rhizosphere soil were much higher than those from the bulk soil. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the abundance of seven selected genes, bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, amoA genes of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nosZ gene, mcrA gene, and pmoA gene, was lower in the rhizosphere soil than in the bulk soil, which is contrary to the results of previous studies. The lower concentration of N in the rhizosphere soil indicated that the competition for N in the rhizosphere soil was very strong, thus having a negative effect on the numbers of microbes. We concluded that when N was limiting, the growth of rhizosphere microorganisms depended on their competitive abilities with rice roots for N.

Through the reflection of the internal multi-level pore structure and the dielectric loss effect of CNTs, the dissipation and absorption of electromagnetic waves are realized. This KGM derived CNTs foam exhibits high specific microwave absorption performance with a minimum absorption of -25.2 dB at 11.3 GHz and a qualified bandwidth of around 2.89 GHz (RL <= -10 dB), which is achieved by KDCF5/Epoxy with the coating layer thickness of 1.8 mm. We provide a novel and cost-effective method to achieve excellent absorbing performance under thin thickness and low load. The CNTs foam also has a lower density (6.5 mg/cm(3)) and can improve the absorbing properties of the epoxy while maintaining its various advantages, thereby expanding the application range of the epoxy resin.

Using first-principles calculations, we systematically explore the potential application of a two-dimensional BP2 monolayer as a cathode material for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. The pristine BP2 monolayer exhibits metallic characteristics, which facilitate the transportation of electrons. The Li and Na atoms bind strongly to the BP2 monolayer, indicating a good structural stability. Furthermore, the geometrical structure of BP2 is well maintained during the adsorption process. The Li and Na ions prefer to move along the zigzag direction with relatively low energy barriers. Especially, the ultralow Na diffusion barrier (0.03 eV) implies that monolayer BP2 has an excellent charge/discharge capability. The specific capacity and average electrode potential of Li (Na) are 619.45 (279.93) mA h g(-1) and 2.89 (2.49) V, respectively. These results reveal that the BP2 monolayer is an appealing cathode material for alkali-metal batteries.

Herein, a novel Li nucleation-diffusion-growth mechanism based on Li-Sn alloy/Li3N electrolyte (LS/LN) composite interface layer is proposed, which synergistically guides the horizontal deposition of Li to suppress the vertical growth of Li dendrite and side reactions with the electrolyte. The lithiophilic Li-Sn alloy captures Li ions to nucleate preferentially on the alloy sites, and simultaneously the Li3N with low diffusion energy barrier and high Li-ion conductivity efficiently transports Li ions to nucleation sites during Li plating, consequently promoting the Li horizontal deposition. As a result, the LS/LN-Li symmetric cells can stably cycle 1600 h even at a high current density of 5 mA cm(-2) and deposition capacity of 5 mA h cm(-2). The LiFePO4 divide LS/LN-Li cells with a high loading of 8.2 mg cm(-2) present a high capacity retention of 93.4% after 1000 cycles, much higher than that using bare Li (64.8%). Furthermore, the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 divide LS/LN-Li cells present more excellent cycling stability than the cells using bare Li. The Li nucleation-diffusion-growth mechanism opens a promising route to solve the challenge of the vertical growth of Li dendrite and achieve highly stable Li metal batteries.

Various precursor concentrations and deposition durations were manipulated to tailor the surface morphologies of Mn3O4 nanostructures and to optimize their electrochemical performances. The Mn3O4 samples prepared at 0.05 M Mn(NO3)(2) solution for 30 min delivered a large gravimetric specific capacitance of 210 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1), and a good rate capability over other samples. This superior electrochemical performance may be attributed to the improved electrode conductivity with increased accessible area for electrolytes ions. Furthermore, a nanocomposite film based on Mn3O4/carbon foam was fabricated by utilizing the developed optimized conditions. The Mn3O4/carbon foam films exhibit an excellent specific capacitance with negligible degradation in retaining specific capacitance values up to 4000 cycles. These findings could further broaden the applications of hausmannite Mn3O4 in electrochemical energy storage electrodes.

Low cost and renewable sulfur-polymers by inverse vulcanisation, and their potential for mercury capture	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							LI-S BATTERIES; ELEMENTAL SULFUR; DICYCLOPENTADIENE; POLYMERIZATION; REMOVAL; MODULUS	Sulfur is not only a highly abundant element, but also produced as a by-product of the petrochemicals industry. However, it has not been conventionally used to produce functional materials because polymeric sulfur is unstable, and decomposes back to its monomer. Recently, inverse vulcanisation has been used to produce stable polymeric materials with elemental sulfur as a major component. Here we report a series of alternative crosslinkers for inverse vulcanisation that are either low-cost industrial byproducts, or bio-derived renewables. These are shown to produce stable polymers with superior properties to previously reported materials. When made porous by the action of supercritical carbon dioxide or salt templating, these high sulfur polymers show excellent potential for mercury capture and filtration.	[Parker, D. J.; Jones, H.

The rechargeable aluminum/sulfur (Al/S) battery is of great interest owing to its high energy density (1340 Wh kg(-1)) and low cost. However, Al/S chemistry suffers poor reversibility owing to the difficulty of oxidizing AlSx. Herein, we demonstrate the first reversible Al/S battery in ionic-liquid electrolyte with an activated carbon cloth/sulfur composite cathode. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic results suggest that sulfur undergoes a solid-state conversion reaction in the electrolyte. Kinetics analysis identifies that the slow solid-state sulfur conversion reaction causes large voltage hysteresis and limits the energy efficiency of the system.

J	Sorkin, A; Tay, B; Su, HB				Sorkin, Anastassia; Tay, Bengkang; Su, Haibin			Three-Stage Transformation Pathway from Nanodiamonds to Fullerenes	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; CARBON CLUSTERS; ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; C-60 CLUSTERS; HIGH-PRESSURE; SOLID C-60; DIAMOND; SIMULATIONS; STABILITY; GRAPHITIZATION	The dynamics of structure evolution of nanodiamonds ranging from 22 to 318 atoms of various shapes is studied by density functional tight-binding molecular dynamics. The spherical and cubic nanodiamonds can be transformed into fullerene-like structures upon heating. A number of the transformed fullerenes consist of pentagons and hexagons only. Others contain squares, heptagons, and octagons. One simulated fullerene is an isomer of C-60. The temperature of the transformation depends on the size, shape, and orientation of initial cluster. To be transformed into onion-like fullerenes, the spherical nanodiamonds should have 200 atoms or more, while the cubic ones require 302 atoms or more. The time-resolved energy profiles of all the transformations clearly reveal three-stage transformation character. During the first stage, the energy reduces quickly due to converting sp(3) carbon with dangling bond at the surface into sp(2) one, and the formation of partial sp(2) envelope wrapping the cluster. For the second stage, energy decreases slowly. The remaining interior carbon atoms come to the surface through the hole in the sp(2) envelope, and similar amount of sp(3) and sp(2) atoms coexist. The third stage involves the closure of holes, accompanied by the detachment of C-2 molecules and carbon chains from the edges. The energy decreases relatively fast in this stage. The proposed three-stage transformation pathway holds for all the simulations performed in this work, including those with the instant heating.

In this work, we developed a dual metal atomic catalyst with uniform distributions of two adjacent Cu-Cu or Cu-Ni atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks, featuring distinctive catalytic sites for CO electroreduction. Due to the synergistic effect between adjacent metal sites, the dual Cu-Cu atomic catalyst enables efficient CO electroreduction to C2+ products with an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of similar to 91% and a high partial current density over 90 mA.cm(-2). In contrast, the dual Cu-Ni atomic catalyst exhibits a remarkably different CO electroreduction selectivity mainly toward CH4. Theoretical calculations suggest that the dual Cu atomic sites facilitate the electroreduction of two CO molecules and subsequent carbon-carbon coupling toward ethylene and acetate, while the replacement of one of the dual Cu atoms with Ni results in too strong CO adsorption, and thus only the single Cu atom functions as the catalytic site for the C-1 reduction pathway.

However, the MoS2-based SIBs usually suffered from the weaknesses of the low rate capability and poor cycling stability induced by the sluggish kinetics of Na+ intercalation and the diffluent discharge products. Herein, the defective MoS2 nanocrystals and sulfur nanodots simultaneously embedded in sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fibers were fabricated via an electrospunning technology, followed by a simple annealing treatment. The unique architecture, in which MoS2 nanolayers and sulfur nanodots were mounted inside the SPAN fiber, provided multi-entry and short-range channel for sodium ion to ensure a fast kinetics. Besides, sulfur defects within MoS2 produced the strong chemical interaction for fixing soluble discharge products. As a result, the electrode performed outstanding sodium-storage performance with a superior long cycling life (8000 cycles at 5 A g(-1), 15,000 cycles at 10 A g(-1)) and excellent rate capability (212 mAh g(-1) at 25 A g(-1)). The full cell fabricated by using Na3V2(PO4)(3) as the cathode also delivered good energy storage performance and successfully powered a group of light-emitting diode.

However, conventional PUF key-based secure tags encounter several bottlenecks, such as complicated manufacturing, specialized and tedious readout, long authentication time, and insufficient stability. Here, we utilize various two-dimensional materials (2DMs), including Ti3C2Tx MXene and graphene oxide, to construct multigenerational microstructures as PUF patterns. Two intermediate treatments, cation intercalation and moisture-induced lubrication, are introduced in between sequential contractions to engineer the multiscale patterns in a transfer-free and scalable fashion. A deep learning (DL)-facilitated software is developed to pre-categorize the hierarchical topographies with classifiable features. Thereafter, the search-and-compare is conducted within a smaller database to shorten the overall authentication time. The synergy between 2DM tags and DL-facilitated software enables a reliable and environmentally stable anticounterfeiting technology, DeepKey, showing superior encoding capacity (>10(144,494)) and short authentication time (similar to 3.5 min). Our 2DM anticounterfeiting tag is finally integrated with QR codes to provide two-layer information security.

Before applying a calibrated spectral predictive model to acquire soil information, either independent validation or k-fold cross validation is used to evaluate model performance. However, there is no consensus on which validation strategy is more suitable and robust when evaluating model performance for the studies in different scales. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the model performance of two validation strategies coupling different calibration sizes (a ratio of calibration to validation of 2:1, 4:1 and 9:1) and calibration sampling strategies (random sampling (RS), rank, Kennard-Stone (KS), rank-Kennard-Stone (RKS) and conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS)) across scales. A total of 17,272 vis-NIR spectra of mineral soils from LUCAS data (continental scale) and their soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay contents were used in this study, and the dataset was further split into national (2761 samples in France) and five regional datasets (110 to 248 samples from five French administrative regions). To eliminate the effect of changing validation set on the model performance, a consistent test set (20% of total samples at each scale) was split to evaluate all the combinations involved in two validation strategies. The Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of the cubist model were stable for both SOC and clay for different calibration sizes, calibration sampling and validation strategies for a large calibration size (>1400) at the national and continental scales. A larger calibration size can potentially improve model performance for a small dataset (<300) at the regional scale, and a wider calibration range would result in better model performance. No silver bullet was found among the different calibration sampling strategies at the regional scale. For five French regions (small data set), we found a high variation (95th percentile minus the 5th percentile) in the CCC among the models built from 50 repeated RS (0.10-0.44 for SOC, 0.16-0.52 for clay) and cLHS (0.08-0.40 for SOC, 0.12-0.36 for clay). This finding indicates that a one-time RS or cLHS for selecting the calibration set has high uncertainty in model evaluation for a small dataset and therefore should be used with caution. Therefore, we suggest the following: (1) for a large data set (thousands), either one-time random sampling for independent validation or k-fold cross validation would be appropriate; (2) for a small data set (dozens to hundreds), k-fold cross validation and/or repeated random sampling for independent validation would be more robust for spectral predictive model evaluation.

Herein, we explore for the first time, the common vulcanization accelerators viz. thiuram polysulfides embedded in carbon nanotubes as binder-free cathodes in lithium batteries that show 3 highly reversible redox reactions (3 discharge plateaus) and high material utilization (up to 97%). We use electrochemical characterization techniques, first-principles calculations, XPS, XRD, FTIR, and SEM to gain insight into the chemical transformations occurring during battery cycling. We identify that the mesomeric form of lithium pentamethylene dithiocarbamate with a positive nitrogen center, formed in the discharge, can act as polysulfide and sulfide anchors through strong coulombic interactions thus enabling a capacity retention of 87% after 100 cycles at C/5 rate. A high loading cathode with an areal capacity of 5.3 mA h cm(-2) tested under a low electrolyte to active material ratio of 3 mu L mg(-1) yields an active material specific energy of 1156 W h kg(-1) thus demonstrating the potential of this class of compounds in high specific energy lithium batteries.

Due to the high ionic conductivity and low electrochemical activity of Li3PS4, the intimate protection layer of LPS can not only prevent the formation of Li dendrites, but also reduces parasitic side reactions and improves the electrochemical performance. As a result, symmetric cells with the LPS protection layer can deliver stable Li plating/stripping for 2000 h. Full cells assembled with the LPS-protected Li exhibit two times higher capacity retention in Li-S batteries (approximate to 800 mAh g(-1)) at 5 A g(-1) for over 400 cycles compared to their bare Li counterparts. Furthermore, high rate performances can be achieved with Li-LPS/LiCoO2 cells, which are capable of cycling at rates as high as 20 C. This innovative and scalable approach to stabilizing the Li anode can serve as a basis for the development of next-generation high-performance lithium-metal batteries.

We report that introducing Mo into Nb2O5 at a low temperature leads to phase transition from bronze-phase T to crystallographic shear-phase H. The resulting Nb1Mo0.1O2.8 exhibits higher energy density than T-Nb2O5 and improved rate-performance and cycling-stability compared to H-Nb2O5. Neutron diffraction was applied to Nb1Mo0.1O2.8 to characterize the structure and two-phase ratios of the mixed metal oxide together with the first-principles method to calculate the possible Mo substitution sites. The Nb1Mo0.1O2.8 anode displays intrinsic pseudocapacitive lithium-ion intercalation with a high energy density of 362 mA h g(-1) at 0.2C. In situ XRD results suggest that Nb1Mo0.1O2.8 is able to intercalate more lithium ions with smaller structure expansion compared with H-Nb2O5; furthermore, a computational method reveals that the introduction of Mo into the oxide increases Li atom adsorption energies and decreases the diffusion barrier. Therefore, Nb1Mo0.1O2.8 is a promising anode material for high-capacity and high-rate lithium-ion energy storage.

We report a novel approach to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment utilizing a light-responsive nanoconstruct. Effectiveness is increased by enhancing drug absorption through heating and the production of free radicals. Treatment specificity is increased through chemical targeting of the nanoconstruct and localization of light delivery to the tumor. When reaching the tumor, magnetic resonance imaging is enhanced and near-infrared fluorescence is activated upon drug release, making it possible to visualize the localized treatment at both the tissue and cellular levels. This dual-modality imaging nanoconstruct enables the synergistic treatment and observable evaluation of solid tumors with dramatically improved efficacy, giving rise to a promising new approach for cancer therapy and evaluation.

The battery costs dropped by 98 % in the last three decades and the storage capacity increased by a factor of three to four in the same period. The recent strong progress in the development of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) can be associated to both the progress in the engineering of the battery pack, and the progress of active materials for the cathode. From the system perspective, only a fraction of the overall improvement is due to better chemistries. Even larger contributions are expected from new cell-to-pack and the cell-to-chassis designs. The new designs provide more space for the active material so that also less energetic, but more sustainable, safer and cheaper materials can be (re)considered, such as LiFePO4 which encounters a renaissance at the moment. The sodium ion battery is currently emerging as a potential alternative to the LIB. Li-air and Li-S batteries are not ready for application in cars, yet. A potential future candidate is the solid-state battery, which shall benefit from the use of a safe Li metal anode, delivering higher capacities and rate capabilities.

Battery technologies using Li metal anodes have shown much higher energy density than current Li-ion batteries (LIBs) such as Li-O-2 and Li-S systems. However, issues related to dendritic Li formation and low Coulombic efficiency have prevented the use of Li metal anode technology in many practical applications. In this paper, a thermally conductive separator coated with boron-nitride (BN) nano-sheets has been developed to improve the stability of the Li metal anodes. It is found that using the BN-coated separator in a conventional organic carbonate-based electrolyte results in the Coulombic efficiency stabilizing at 92% over 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.5 mA/cm(2) and 88% at 1.0 mA/cm(2). The improved Coulombic efficiency and reliability of the Li metal anodes is due to the more homogeneous thermal distribution resulting from the thermally conductive BN coating and to the smaller surface area of initial Li deposition.

However, the EG production from cellulose is dependent on Ni and Ru based catalysts. Herein, encapsulated Co@C catalyst was firstly applied for EG production from cellulose combined with tungstic acid (TA). The mixing of the two catalysts in different ratios was compared and well-controlled, and the highest 67.3% yield of EG can be achieved. TA is used mainly to promote both the cellulose hydrolysis and the retro-aldol reaction of glucose to glycolaldehyde. Co@C catalysts are responsible for the hydrogenation of glycolaldehyde to EG. Compared with traditional noble metals and composite catalysts, the inexpensive and easily synthesized Co@C catalysts could greatly reduce the cost of production of EG. The Co@C catalysts encapsulated with outside graphene layers can keep high stability for at least 6 runs.

In this study, chitosan, an amino polysaccharide, was blended with inorganic nanocomponents, Fe3O4 and graphene oxide (GO) and electrosprayed to fabricate uniform microspheres with the diameters ranging from 100 mu m to 1100 mu m. An anti-cancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), was loaded to the microspheres by an adsorption or embedding method. The microsphere is responsive to magnetic fields due to the presence of Fe3O4, and the incorporation of GO enhanced the drug loading capacity. The fast stimuli-responsive release of DOX can be facilely controlled by using NIR irradiation due to the strong photo-thermal conversion of Fe3O4 and GO, In addition, ultrasound was used as another external stimulus for DOX release.

Methanol as a Reaction Medium and Reagent in Substrate Reactions of Rhodium Porphyrins	INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY; CARBON-MONOXIDE; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; BOND ACTIVATION; RH-OH; WATER; OLEFINS; PH; THERMODYNAMICS; STABILITY	Methanol solutions of rhodium(III) tetra(p-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin [(TSPP)Rh-III] have a hydrogen ion dependent equilibrium between bis-methanol, monomethoxy monomethanol, and bis-methoxy complexes. Reactions of dihydrogen (D-2) with solutions of [(TSPP)Rh-III] complexes in methanol produce equilibrium distributions of a rhodium hydride [(TSPP)Rh-III-D(CD3OD)](-4) and rhodium(I) complex [(TSPP)Rh-I(CD3OD)](-5). The rhodium hydride complex in methanol functions as a weak acid with an acid dissociation constant of 1.1(0.1) x 10(-9) at 298 K. Patterns of rhodium hydride substrate reactions in methanol are illustrated by addition with ethene, acetaldehyde, and carbon monoxide to form rhodium alkyl, alpha-hydroxyethyl, and formyl complexes, respectively. The free energy change for the addition reaction of [(TSPP)Rh-III-D(CD3OD)](-4) with CO in methanol to produce a formyl complex (Delta G degrees((298K)) = -4.7(0.1) kcal mol(-1)) is remarkably close to Delta G degrees((298K)) values for analogous reactions in water and benzene. Addition reactions of the rhodium hydride ([(TSPP)Rh-III-D(CD3OD)](-4)) with vinyl olefins invariably yield the anti-Markovnikov product which places the rhodium porphyrin on the less hindered terminal primary carbon center. Addition of the rhodium-methoxide unit in [(TSPP)Rh-III-OCD3(CD3OD)](-4) with olefins to form beta-methoxyalkyl complexes places rhodium on the terminal carbon for alkene hydrocarbons and vinyl acetate, but vinyl olefins that have pi-electron withdrawing substituents have a thermodynamic preference for placing rhodium on the interior carbon where negative charge is better accommodated. Equilibrium thermodynamic values for addition of the Rh-OCD3 unit to olefins in methanol are evaluated and compared with values for Rh-OH addition to olefins in water.

To do so, Navier-Stokes equations were solved with modified second-order slip boundary conditions in nanocapillaries of organic matter (OM) and nanoslits of inorganic matrix (iOM). Due to gas adsorption, both surface diffusion and bulk gas flow affect the apparent gas permeability (AGP) of OM. Particularly, the Langmuir-slip model is used for the calculation of boundary velocity of bulk gas. In contrast, gas flow in a single nanoslit of iOM accounts for the impact of adsorbed water film with a certain thickness quantified by Li's model [15]. Additionally, porous deformation and real gas effect are included in both models of OM and iOM. As such, a unified AGP model of shale matrix is formulated based on the total organic carbon (TOC) content including contributions of both OM and iOM. Results show that, under depressurization condition, the AGP of OM/iOM with a large pore size distribution (PSD) presents a similar shape of "V", while the AGP of iOM with a small PSD increases monotonously. The total flow capacity of OM is contributed by competitive mechanisms of surface diffusion, induced- and pure- bulk gas flow under various PSDs and pressure. For gas flow capacity in iOM with a small PSD, it can be weakened by adsorbed water film but compensated by nanoscale effect considerably at low pressures. Moreover, a higher relative humidity (RH) leads to a thicker water film resulting in a lower gas conductance. The AGP of shale matrix can be reduced or enhanced by the TOC content when accounting for gas adsorption and adsorbed water film. Besides, the real gas effect enhances flow capacity significantly in small pores with a high pressure. The proposed model provides a comprehensive understanding of the gas flow mechanism in shale nanopores under reservoir conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The interactions between microbes and the surface of a carbon electrode play a vital role in capturing the respiratory electrons from bacteria. Therefore, improvements in the electrochemical and physicochemical properties of carbon materials are essential for increasing performance. In this study, a microwave and sulfuric acid treatment was used to modify the surface structure of graphite granules. The prepared expandable graphite granules (EGG) exhibited a 1.5 times higher power den-sity than the unmodified graphite granules (1400 vs. 900 mW/m ). Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed improved physical and chemical characteristics of the EGG surface. These results suggest that physical and chemical surface modification using sulfuric acid and microwave heating improves the performance of electrode-based bioprocesses, such as MFCs.

MPC with partial replacement of fly ash was employed as the binding matrix. Some carbon-based materials, such as graphite, carbon black, carbon fiber, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were used to construct the conductive phase. A simple hot-press process was applied to produce the composite. The formula and the structure of the composite was modified and adjusted to optimize the properties of the composite to meet the US DOE 2015 technical targets, including the introducing of a reinforcement support. Finally, all the technical targets such as electrical conductivity (>100 S cm(-1)), the flexural strength (>25 MPa), the corrosion resistance (<1 mu A cm(-2)), and gas permeability (<10(-5) cm(3) ( s cm(2))(-1)) were achieved as well as low cost (<5 $ per kW). The optimized formula and the detailed procedures to fabricate the MPC based composite were concluded.

Then, Constant Component Expansion (CCE) experiments were carried out with the hydrocarbon components and different molar fractions of CO2. According to the results, it was obviously that hydrocarbon components could expand the volume because of mixing the CO2. However, the expansion degree was largely influenced by the hydrocarbon properties. Therefore, a new parameter named the molar density was proposed to characterize these influences. The study found that hydrocarbon swelling factor and molar density were strict linear relationship. Based on this regulation and additional theoretical derivation, a prediction model was established to calculating volume expansion degree of CO2 + crude oil. With the experimental results of reservoir oil from CQ oilfield, it was turned out that the prediction model could successfully and precisely calculate crude oil swelling degree.

J	Li, S; Qiu, WX; Gao, JH				Li, Shuai; Qiu, Wen-Xuan; Gao, Jin-Hua			Designing artificial two dimensional electron lattice on metal surface: a Kagome-like lattice as an example	NANOSCALE			English	Article							QUANTUM CORRALS; DIRAC FERMIONS	Recently, a new kind of artificial two dimensional (2D) electron lattice on the nanoscale, i.e. molecular graphene, has drawn a lot of interest, where the metal surface electrons are transformed into a honeycomb lattice via absorbing a molecular lattice on the metal surface [Gomes et al., Nature, 2012, 438, 306; Wang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2014, 113, 196803]. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that this technique can be readily used to build other complex 2D electron lattices on a metal surface, which are of high interest in the field of condensed matter physics. The main challenge to build a complex 2D electron lattice is that this is a quantum antidot system, where the absorbed molecule normally exerts a repulsive potential on the surface electrons. Thus, there is no straightforward corresponding relation between the molecular lattice pattern and the desired 2D lattice of surface electrons. Here, we give an interesting example about the Kagome lattice, which has exotic correlated electronic states. We design a special molecular pattern and show that this molecular lattice can transform the surface electrons into a Kagome-like lattice. The numerical simulation is conducted using a Cu(111) surface and CO molecules. We first estimate the effective parameters of the Cu/CO system by fitting experimental data of the molecular graphene. Then, we calculate the corresponding energy bands and LDOS of the surface electrons in the presence of the proposed molecular lattice. Finally, we interpret the numerical results by the tight binding model of the Kagome lattice. We hope that our work can stimulate further theoretical and experimental interest in this novel artificial 2D electron lattice system.

Efficiencies in the presence and absence of acetate and glucose were compared through open-circuit reference experiments. Significant differences in degradation efficiency were observed in six reactors. The highest and lowest degradation efficiencies were observed in the closed-circuit reactor fed with glucose and in the open-circuit reactor, respectively. This finding was due to the enhanced bacterial metabolism caused by the application of micro-electrical field and degradable organics as co-substrates. The different treatment efficiencies were also caused by the distinct bacterial communities. The composition of bacterial community was affected by adding different organics as co-substrates. At the phylum level, the most dominant bacteria in the reactor with the added acetate and glucose were Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, respectively.

Herein, we have developed a facile catalyst design to embed ultrafine Pt nanoparticles inside the nanopores of carbon support towards increased Pt atom utilization and suppressed Ostwald ripening through space-confinement effect. Besides, the novel strategy endows the resultant Pt nanoparticles with an optimized electronic structure, which further accelerates ORR kinetics. Due to these attributes, the as-prepared Pt nano particle inside pore (Ptinside/KJ600) catalyst have shown remarkable initial mass activity of 0.558 A mg(-1)Pt (@0.9 V vs RHE), which is 3.30 times higher than commercial Pt/C and outperforms most of the reported Pt catalysts. Beyond that, the catalyst also exhibits significantly improved durability with 9 mV negative shift in half-wave potential after 20 K cycles, while commercial Pt/C benchmark displays a 52 mV negative shift. The structural characterizations after durability test confirmed that the pore-confinement design can effectively inhibit the particle agglomeration with negligible increase in particle size. This catalyst design can be easily applicable to other metal-based catalyst and heteroatoms doping.

The effects of GPL contents on the densification, grain growth and mechanical properties of the TaC-SiC/GPL composites were evaluated. Due to the surface reactions between SiC and TaC particles, relative density of the composite increased to 99.3% at GPL content of 1.0 wt%. The GPLs wrapped around the grains and acted as barriers for mass diffusion, therefore inhibiting grain growth. The flexural strength of the composite increased at first and reached maximum value of 570 MPa at the GPL content of 1.0 wt%; the fracture toughness reached the peak value of 5.8 MPa m(1/2) at the GPL content of 1.5 wt%. Bending, bridging and pullout of GPLs were considered as the main toughening mechanisms. Thus, this work provides a new guide for the fabrication of TaC ceramics with high density and high fracture strength.

Here, the ICE and cycling performance of Si-based anode have been simultaneously improved through preparing Si@C@Graphite materials where the conformal carbon modifiers derived from natural biopolymer binders covalently attached to Si particles could enhance the cycling stability, among which GA-derived carbon layer with N, O heteroatoms could best ameliorate the Li+ transport kinetics and thereby rendering superior electrochemical properties, while artificial graphite (AGr) could significantly promote the overall ICE and more effectively elevate the reversible capacity. An excellent ICE (86.4%), a prominent rate performance (1240.6 mAh g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1)) and a promoted cycling stability (1320.5 mAh g(-1) at 800 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles) could be presented by Si@GAC@AGr anode. This research provides an effective strategy of simultaneously improving ICE and cycling performance of Si-based anodes and inspires rational design of high-energy-density LIB anodes.

To investigate the direct relationship between KCO2 and waves, laboratory experiments are conducted in a wind-wave flume. Three types of waves are forced in the flume: modulational wave trains generated by a wave maker, wind waves with 10-m wind speed ranging from 4.5 to 15.5ms(-1), and (mechanically generated) modulational wave trains coupled with superimposed wind force. The wave height and wave orbital velocity are found to be well correlated with KCO2 whereas wind speed alone cannot adequately describe KCO2. To reconcile the measurements, nondimensional equations are established in which gas transfer velocity is expressed as a main function of wave parameters and an additional secondary factor to account for influence of the wind.

J	Tong, XH; Choi, P; Li, S; Shi, YX; Zhang, H				Tong, Xuhang; Choi, Phillip; Li, Shuang; Shi, Yixiang; Zhang, Hao			Molecular dynamics study on structure evolution of monocarboxylic acid intercalated layered double hydroxides	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; HYDROTALCITE; TEMPERATURE; CO2; SIMULATION; ENERGETICS; ADSORBENT; HYDRATION; EXCHANGE; SORPTION	Hydrotalcite derived materials are considered to be promising candidates for solid sorbents for carbon dioxide capture at intermediate temperatures (250-400 degrees C). The recently developed organically intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH) shows a great improvement in carbon dioxide adsorption capacity compared to alternative sorbents. However, the molecular-scale structure of this new class of materials is yet to be understood, hindering the further development of high-capacity carbon dioxide adsorbents based on LDH. In the current study, classical molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate the atomistic structures of monocarboxylic acid intercalated LDHs containing Mg and Al in the ratio 3 : 1. The replacement of carbonate anions by stearate anions (CH3(CH2)(16)COO-) in LDH expanded the basal spacing from 7.8 angstrom to 19.6 angstrom. The presence of water molecules could further increase the basal spacing to up to 33.5 angstrom. In addition, the basal spacing of LDH could be expanded by other carboxylic anions (e.g., CH3(CH2)(11)COO-, CH3(CH2) 5COO(-)), and the spacing was proportional to the length of the carbon chains. Water molecules inside interlayer galleries tend to bond firstly with the hydroxyl groups of hydroxide layers, and water molecules added subsequently then fill the gallery space. For comparison, LDHs intercalated by CH3(CH2)(16)COO- and CH3(CH2)(6)COO- were prepared by the acid-aided anion-exchange method and characterized by powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, thermogravimetry (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The basal spacing and XRD patterns observed in the simulations are in good agreement with experimental observations. The quantitative analyses in this work could provide guidelines for optimizing the lamellar structure of LDH to improve its capacity for CO2 capture.

In situ synthesis of Ti5Si3 intermetallic particulate locally reinforced medium carbon steel-matrix composite via the SHS reaction of Fe-Ti-Si system during casting	ISIJ INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						in situ; intermetallic; locally reinforced; steel matrix composite; SHS	SLIDING WEAR BEHAVIOR; SURFACE COMPOSITES; TITANIUM SILICIDE; MICROSTRUCTURE; FE-TIB2; TI3SIC2; ALLOYS; FORM	The in situ Ti5Si3 intermetallic particulate locally reinforced steel matrix composites are successfully fabricated by the self-propagating high-ternperature synthesis (SHS) reaction of Fe-T-Si system during casting, and the microstructures of the composites reveal a relatively uniform distribution of mango-like Ti5Si3 particulates in the local reinforcing regions. XRD results reveal that in addition to alpha-Fe and Ti,Si, phases, the transient Fe,T is also present in the local reinforcing region of the composites. Furthermore, some Ti3SiC2 particulates are formed and distribute in the limited region nearby the interface between the local reinforcing region and steel matrix. With Fe content increasing from 10 to 30wt% in the preforms, the Ti5Si3 particulate size is decreased obviously in the local reinforcing region; furthermore, the presence of significant porosity can be detected in the composite synthesized by the 10 wt% Fe-Ti-Si system; on the contrary, only a minimal porosity can be found in that synthesized by 30wt% Fe in Fe-Ti-Si system. The macro- and micro-hardness as well as the wear resistance of the local reinforcing region are obviously higher than those of the un-reinforced medium steel. Improvements in hardness and wear resistance of the composite are mainly attributed to the presence of high volume fraction of hard intermetallic Ti5Si3 particulates.

FeCo was used to enhance electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption in different frequency band and broaden effective absorbing bandwidth, while carbon was used to improve impedance matching. Triple-shell hollow structure was designed to enrich the multiple interfaces to favor the interfacial polarization, increase the multiple reflections and scattering, and provide physicochemical protection to Fe3O4 core from oxidation. The microstructure and morphology of TSH-Fe3O4/FeCo/C composite microspheres were characterized by TEM, XRD and Raman in detail. The results indicated that magnetic Fe3O4 was completely covered by FeCo and carbon via layer by layer. As an EM wave absorber, the maximum reflection loss of TSH-Fe3O4/FeCo/C composite micro spheres was up to -37.4 dB due to better normalized characteristic impedance at a thickness of 2.2 mm and the bandwidth less than-10 dB even reached up to 5.9 GHz. The excellent EM wave absorption performance was attributed to the combination of shell materials (Fe3O4, FeCo and carbon) and unique triple-shell hollow structure, which lead to multiple relaxation processes and good impedance matching. Consequently, this work would contribute to the design and preparation of high performance EM wave absorbent with outstanding absorbing property and wider absorption range.

Once adding Cl- ions, the QG@MA-Ag modified electrodes, which might otherwise display an Ag oxidization peak at about 0.29 V, could exhibit stable and sharp peaks of solid-state Ag/AgCl electrochemistry at lowering potentials approaching to zero. Moreover, both of the Cl- responses of currents (I) and voltages (V) could vary rationally depending on Cl- concentrations. The responses in conductance (I/V) were thereby conversed alternatively as the signal outputs to ensure the highly selective detection of Cl- ions, with no significant interference from other kinds of halogen ions. The as-developed electroanalysis strategy can facilitate the evaluation of Cl- ions over a broad linear concentration range of 0.25 mu M-250 mM, with the detection limit down to 0.16 mu M. The feasibility of the chloride sensor was subsequently demonstrated in probing Cl- ions separately in sweat and hela cells. Such a detection method with the signal outputs of conductance may feature a new electroanalysis format tailored for highly selective and ultrasensitive analysis of trace-level Cl- ions for the early diagnosis of chloride-indicative diseases.

Despite great progress have made in photocatalyst design, the rate-limiting step that poor accessibility of the O-2 to photocatalysts in water remains unexplored. Here, we design a solid-liquid-air triphasic interface over a melamine foam to boost the interfacial O-2 transportation. A Wenzel-Cassie state coexists in a hydrophobic interface and form a tubular confined space with a thickness of 100 mu m, which allows the O-2 directly transferred to the photocatalyst from the air, greatly boost the formation of H2O2. In addition, a tubular confined microenvironment formed on the surface greatly enhances oxygen diffusion, and suppressed the unwanted decomposition of H2O2. This surface microenvironment engineering resulted in a 10-fold enhancement in the photosynthesis H2O2 compared to the traditional solid-liquid diphase system, pinpointing the necessary O-2 mass diffusion for photocatalytic H2O2 generation.

Addressing uncertainty and bias in land use, land use change, and forestry greenhouse gas inventories	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article						Inventory; Greenhouse gas; Land use; Forestry; Agriculture; Uncertainty	LIDAR-ASSISTED ESTIMATION; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; GHG INVENTORY; MODEL; BIOMASS; SEQUESTRATION; STOCK; EMISSIONS; IMPROVE; URBAN	National greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) will play an increasingly important role in tracking country progress against United Nations (UN) Paris Agreement commitments. Yet uncertainty in land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) NGHGHI estimates may undermine international confidence in emission reduction claims, particularly for countries that expect forests and agriculture to contribute large near-term GHG reductions. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework for implementing the uncertainty provisions of the UN Paris Agreement Enhanced Transparency Framework, with a view to identifying the largest sources of LULUCF NGHGI uncertainty and prioritizing methodological improvements. Using the USA as a case study, we identify and attribute uncertainty across all US NGHGI LULUCF "uncertainty elements" (inputs, parameters, models, and instances of plot-based sampling) and provide GHG flux estimates for omitted inventory categories. The largest sources of uncertainty are distributed across LULUCF inventory categories, underlining the importance of sector-wide analysis: forestry (tree biomass sampling error; tree volume and specific gravity allometric parameters; soil carbon model), cropland and grassland (DayCent model structure and inputs), and settlement (urban tree gross to net carbon sequestration ratio) elements contribute over 90% of uncertainty. Net emissions of 123 MMT CO(2)e could be omitted from the US NGHGI, including Alaskan grassland and wetland soil carbon stock change (90.4 MMT CO2), urban mineral soil carbon stock change (34.7 MMT CO2), and federal cropland and grassland N2O (21.8 MMT CO(2)e). We explain how these findings and other ongoing research can support improved LULUCF monitoring and transparency.

In this work, a computational model which characterizes the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide by CO co-feed in a novel twin reactor is developed with three subsidiaries of chemical reaction kinetics, gas-liquid mass transfer, and transient sun light intensity distribution. Thanks to previous experimental work as the reliable verification for the numerical simulation, the variations of the CH3OH concentration with the CO/CO2 ratio of gas mixture, pressure and temperature are obtained and analyzed. The results show that the carbon in CO can form CH3OH directly, however the excessive CO will react with HCOOCH3 to form CH3CHO, which results in a reduced CH3OH concentration. Besides, the CH3OH concentration subsequently increases as the temperature and pressure increase, and the CH3OH product and reaction rate vary widely with time due to the changing sun light intensity during the day.

Molecular hydrogen storage in Al-doped bulk graphite with wider layer distances	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Carbon; Adsorption; Density functional theory		Molecular hydrogen storage at room temperature in At-doped bulk graphite with wider layer distances was studied using density functional theory calculation. Hydrogen storage capacity of 3.48 wt% or volume density of 51 kg/m(3) was predicted at T = 300 K and P = 0.1 GPa with adsorption energy E-b = -0.264 eV/H-2. This is close to the target of volume density 62 kg/m(3) and satisfies the requirement of immobilization hydrogen with binding strength of 0.2-0.7 eV/H-2 at ambient temperature and modest pressure for commercial applications specified by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Optimization of pentacene double floating gate memories based on charge injection regulated by SAM functionalization	AIP ADVANCES			English	Article							FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; SELF-ASSEMBLED-MONOLAYER; DIELECTRICS; NANOPARTICLES; PERFORMANCE; VOLTAGE; DEVICES; STORAGE	Pentacene based double nano-floating gate memories (NFGM) by using gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets as charge trapping layers are prepared and demonstrated. Particularly, the NFGM chemically treated by 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzenethiol (PFBT) self-assembled monolayers (SAM) exhibits excellent memory performances, including high mobility of 0.23 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1), the large memory window of 51 V, and the stable retention property more than 10(8) s. Comparing the performances of NFGM without treating with PFBT SAM, the improving performances of the memory devices by SAM modification are explained by the increase of charge injection, which could be further investigated by XPS and UPS. In particular, the results highlight the utility of SAM modulations and controlling of charge transport in the development of organic transistor memories. (c) 2018 Author(s).

Observations of OM/OC and specific attenuation coefficients (SAC) in ambient fine PM at a rural site in central Ontario, Canada	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							AEROSOL MASS-SPECTROMETER; SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL; LIGHT-ABSORPTION MEASUREMENTS; LOS-ANGELES; ELEMENTAL CARBON; BLACK CARBON; ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS; LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS; THERMAL MEASUREMENTS; PARTICLE FORMATION	Ambient particulate matter (PM) samples were collected on quartz filters at a rural site in central Ontario during an intensive study in 2007. The concentrations of organic carbon (OC), pyrolysis organic carbon (POC), and elemental carbon (EC) were determined by thermal analysis. The concentrations are compared to the organic aerosol mass concentration (OM) measured with an Aerodyne C-ToF Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) and to the particle absorption coefficient (b(asp)) obtained from a Radiance Research Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP). The total organic mass to organic carbon ratios (OM/OC) and specific attenuation coefficients (SAC=b(asp)/EC) are derived. Proportionality of the POC mass with the oxygen mass in the aerosols estimated from the AMS offers a potential means to estimate OM/OC from thermal measurements only. The mean SAC for the study is 3.8 +/- 0.3 m(2) g(-1). It is found that the SAC is independent of or decrease with increasing particle mass loading, depending on whether or not the data are separated between aerosols dominated by more recent anthropogenic input and aerosols dominated by longer residence time or biogenic components. There is no evidence to support an enhancement of light absorption by the condensation of secondary material to particles, suggesting that present model simulations built on such an assumption may overestimate atmospheric warming by BC.

The gold standard therapy for PAP is whole lung lavage (WLL). Few studies have reported the optimal technique with which to evaluate the response to WLL. In this study, we aimed to identify parameters with which to assess the need for repeat WLL during a long-term 8-year follow-up. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 patients with autoimmune PAP with 80 of whom underwent WLL. Physiologic, serologic, and radiologic features of the patients were analyzed during an 8-year follow-up after the first WLL treatment. Results: Of the 40 patients without any intervention, 39 patients either achieved remission or remained stable and only one died of pulmonary infection. Of the 56 patients who underwent WLL for 1 time, 55 remained free from a second WLL and 1 patient died of cancer. Twenty-four required additional treatments after their first WLL. The baseline PaO 2 (P = 0.000), PA-aO 2 (P = 0.000), shunt fraction rate (P = 0.001), percent of predicted normal diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%Pred) (P = 0.016), 6-min walk test (P = 0.013), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (P = 0.007), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) (P = 0.003) showed significant differences among the three groups. The need for a second WLL was significantly associated with PaO 2 (P = 0.000), CEA (P = 0.050) , the 6-minute walk test (P = 0.026), and DLCO%Pred (P = 0.041). The DLCO%Pred on admission with a cut-off value of 42.1% (P = 0.001) may help to distinguish whether patients with PAP require a second WLL. Conclusions: WLL is the optimal treatment method for PAP and provides remarkable improvements for affected patients. The DLCO%Pred on admission with a cut-off value of 42.1% may distinguish whether patients with PAP require a second WLL.

Herein, a thin and high-strength composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) is developed via infusing a polyethylene oxide (PEO)/(CF3SO2)(2)NLi (LiTFSI) electrolyte into a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) network, where highly efficient and uniform interfacial ion-transport channels are constructed through micro-wetting using trace electrolyte vapor. The trace electrolyte vapor creates fast-ion-transport channels at both the external CPE/electrode interface and the internal PAN/PEO interface in the CPE, and its LiPO2F2 product is favorable for the cycling stability. The rigid PAN network can not only enhance the mechanical strength and promote Li-ion conductivity, but it also strongly adsorbs Li-salt anions and improves the lithium-ion transference number (0.49) of the CPE, inducing the uniform stripping and deposition of Li metal and suppressing Li dendrite growth. The LiFePO4 (LFP)/CPE/Li solid-state battery achieves a specific capacity of 141.1 mA h g(-1) with a capacity retention rate of 85.6% and Coulombic efficiency of 100.0% after 360 cycles at 25 degrees C. This work provides a facile strategy for constructing thin and high strength CPEs with high performance at room temperature.

The elimination of safety concerns and long cycling stability issues are the main challenges that must be solved to apply Li metal anodes in any application. Herein, we design a novel and safe separator for Li metal batteries by integrating thermally management boron nitride (BN) nanosheets into poly vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropene (PVDF-HFP) via an advanced extrusion based 3D printing technique. The BN-separator offers a uniform thermal distribution interface, which enables homogeneous Li nucleation, enhanced suppression of Li dendrite growth, and further improves the overall electrochemical performance. A stable Coulombic efficiency of 92% is maintained after 90 cycles at 1 mA cm(-2) by using this novel separator in Li/Cu cells. In contrast, the Coulombic efficiency of the control cells decreases to 70% after 30 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2). In addition, in a Li/Li symmetric configuration, the cells using the 3D printed BN-separator exhibit improved cycling stability with lower voltage polarization over 500 h. Our findings on 3D printing for a thermally managing BN-separator can serve as a general strategy for further advanced rechargeable batteries.

Evolutionary theories of stomatal behaviour are critical for guarding against prediction errors of empirical models under future climates. Longstanding theory holds that stomata maximise fitness by acting to maintain constant marginal water use efficiency over a given time horizon, but a recent evolutionary theory proposes that stomata instead maximise carbon gain minus carbon costs/risk of hydraulic damage. Using data from 34 species that span global forest biomes, we find that the recent carbon-maximisation optimisation theory is widely supported, revealing that the evolution of stomatal regulation has not been primarily driven by attainment of constant marginal water use efficiency. Optimal control of stomata to manage hydraulic risk is likely to have significant consequences for ecosystem fluxes during drought, which is critical given projected intensification of the global hydrological cycle.

However, carbon deposition, which is one of the serious problems, reduces the activity of Ni-based catalysts. Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts with different Ce loading were prepared by a wet impregnation method. The performance of catalyst in supercritical water was tested in an autoclave reactor at 673 K, 24.5 MPa. The catalysts before and after reaction were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET specific surface area measurements and thermo-gravimetric analyses (TGA). The effects of Ce loading in catalysts on glucose gasification were studied. The results showed that hydrogen yield and hydrogen selectivity increased sharply with addition of Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalysts. When the Ce loading content was 8.46 wt.%, the maximum H-2 yield and H-2 selectivity were obtained. The carbon deposition and coking will lead to the deactivation of the catalysts. Based on the thermo-gravimetric analyses, the oxidant kinetic data of carbon deposited on the used catalysts with air was obtained. CeO2 in the Ni/CeO2/Al2O3 catalyst plays an important role in inhibiting carbon deposition by increasing the Ni dispersion and reacting with deposited carbon. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Development of a kinetic model for bainitic isothermal transformation in transformation-induced plasticity steels	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						TRIP steels; Thermodynamics; Kinetics; Bainitic transformation; Retained austenite	RETAINED AUSTENITE; THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS; FATIGUE BEHAVIOR; TRIP STEELS; NUCLEATION; FERRITE; SI	In this work, we modify existing models to simulate the kinetics of bainitic transformation during the bainitic isothermal transformation (BIT) stage of a typical two-stage heat treatment - BIT is preceded by an intercritical annealing treatment - for TRIP steels. This effort is motivated by experiments performed in a conventional TRIP steel alloy (Fe-0.32C-1.42Mn-1.56Si) that suggest that thermodynamics alone are not sufficient to predict the amount of retained austenite after BIT. The model implemented in this work considers the non-homogeneous distribution of carbon - resulting from finite carbon diffusion rates - within the retained austenite during bainitic transformation. This non-homogeneous distribution is responsible for average austenite carbon enrichments beyond the so-called T-0 line, the temperature at which the chemical driving force for the bainitic transformation is exhausted. In order to attain good agreement with experiments, the existence of carbon-rich austenite films adjacent to bainitic ferrite plates is posited. The presence of this austenite film is motivated by earlier experimental work published by other groups in the past decade. The model is compared with experimental results and good qualitative agreement is found. (c) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ionic transport regulation techniques could also play a crucial role in developing high-performance alkali metal batteries such as alkali metal-sulfur and alkali metal-selenium batteries, which suffer from the non-uniform transport of alkali metal ions (e.g., Li+ or Na+) and detrimental shuttling effect of polysulfide/polyselenide anions. These drawbacks could cause unfavourable growth of alkali metal depositions at the metal electrode and irreversible consumption of cathode active materials, leading to capacity decay and short cycling life. Herein, we propose the use of a polypropylene separator coated with negatively charged Ti0.87O2 nanosheets with Ti atomic vacancies to tackle these issues. In particular, we demonstrate that the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged Ti0.87O2 nanosheets and polysulfide/polyselenide anions reduce the shuttling effect. Moreover, the Ti0.87O2-coated separator regulates the migration of alkali ions ensuring a homogeneous ion flux and the Ti vacancies, acting as sub-nanometric pores, promote fast alkali-ion diffusion. An optimized transport of anions and cations is essential for the development of practical alkali metal batteries. Here, the authors report the use of Ti0.87O2 nanosheets as coating material of polypropylene separators for Li-S, Li-Se and Na-Se cells.

Herein, ultra-clean and monodisperse PtPd nanoflowers (NFs) deposited on graphene oxide (GO) were successfully synthesized via a modified in-situ overgrowth strategy by adding ethanol as an efficient booster in the redox reaction between GO and metallic precursors. As for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the resulting GO/PtPd NFs provide much higher electrocatalytic performances (mass and specific activity as well as long-term durability) than the loading of monometallic Pt or Pd nanoparticles on the GO support. Especially, compared to MOR test at room temperature (25 degrees C), 70% electrocatalytic activity of GO/PtPd NFs can be maintained even under low temperature (5 degrees C) condition, while that of commercial Pt/C catalysts is merely about 57%. The unique product with enhanced low-temperature electrocatalytic activity holds great potential for promoting the utilization of fuel cells in grimly cold weather condition.

Herein, we developed a class of soft robotic skins based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs) and gelatin hydrogels, featuring skin-like multifunctionality (stretchability, thermoregulation, threat protection, and strain sensing). The 2DM-integrated hydrogel (2DM/H) skins enabled soft robots to execute designated missions in the presence of high levels of heat and various environmental threats while maintaining mild machine temperatures. Via adopting different 2DMs (graphene oxide (GO), montmorillonite (MMT), and titanium carbide (MXene)), the 2DM/H-protected robots were able to perform soft grasping in organic liquids (GO/H) and open fire (MMT/H), and in the presence of electromagnetic radiation and biocontamination (MXene/H). Through blending MXene nanosheets into gelatin, the MXene-blended hydrogel (M-H) skin became strain sensitive, and a GO/M-H gripper exhibited the high-level integration of skin-mimicking capabilities. Finally, we incorporated 2DM/H skins onto an origami-inspired walker robot and a soft batoid-like robot to execute vision-guided searching in fire and underwater locomotion/navigation in chemical spills.

Joshua			Evolution of Cenozoic seawater lithium isotopes: Coupling of global denudation regime and shifting seawater sinks	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						lithium isotopes; seawater chemistry; Cenozoic climate; weathering; erosion; carbon cycle	CARBON-CYCLE; WEATHERING PROCESSES; MASS-BALANCE; GEOCHEMICAL CYCLES; DISSOLVED LITHIUM; CO2 CONSUMPTION; OCEANIC-CRUST; PORE WATERS; RIVERS; FRACTIONATION	The Li isotopic record of seawater shows a dramatic increase of similar to 9 parts per thousand over the past similar to 60 million years. Here we use a model to explore what may have caused this change. We focus particularly on considering how changes in the "reverse weathering" sinks that remove Li from seawater can contribute to explain the observed increase. Our interpretation is based on dividing the oceanic sink, which preferentially removes light Li, into two components: (i) removal into marine authigenic clays in sediments at low temperatures, with associated high fractionation factors, and (ii) removal into altered oceanic basalt at higher temperatures and resulting lower fractionation factors. We suggest that increases in the flux of degraded continental material delivered to the oceans over the past 60 Ma could have increased removal of Li into sedimentary authigenic clays versus altered basalt. Because altered basalt is associated with a smaller isotopic fractionation, an increasing portion of the lower temperature (authigenic clay-associated) sink could contribute to the rise of the seawater Li isotope value. This effect would moderate the extent to which the isotopic value of continental inputs must have changed in order to explain the seawater record over the Cenozoic. Nonetheless, unless the magnitude of fractionation during removal differs significantly from current understanding, substantial change in the delta Li-7 of inputs from continental weathering must have occurred. Our modeling suggests that dissolved riverine fluxes in the early Eocene were characterized by delta Li-7 of similar to 0 to +13 parts per thousand, with best estimates of 6.6-12.6 parts per thousand; these values imply increases over the past 60 Myrs of between 10 and 24 parts per thousand, and we view a similar to 13 parts per thousand increase as a likely scenario. These changes would have been accompanied by increases in both the dissolved Li flux from continental weathering and the removal flux from seawater into marine authigenic clays. Increases in delta Li-7 of continental input are consistent with a change in the global denudation regime as a result of increasing continental erosion rate through the Cenozoic. Changes in denudation may have meant increasing climate sensitivity of weathering over time but do not require globally supply-limited and thus entirely climate-insensitive weathering in the early Cenozoic.

Sulfur-containing biochar has a wide range of applications, such as adsorptive removal of pollutants (e.g., Hg, Cd, and Ni) and acting as a solid acid catalyst or as an electrode of Li-S battery. To date, many methods have been developed to strengthen the function of biochar by introducing sulfur-containing groups to promote the application and commercialization of biochar. This review aims to present the formation, analysis, engineering, and application of sulfur-functional groups in biochar. The sulfur-functional groups such as organic sulfur (e.g., C-S, -C-S-C-, C=S, thiophene, and sulfone) and inorganic sulfur (e.g., sulfate, sulfide, sulfite, and elemental S) can be determined through Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). The sulfur-functional groups can be obtained through selecting biomass composition, pyrolysis process, S-doping, and post-treatment of biochar, but the engineering is challenging. The positive effect of sulfur-functional groups in the application is also analyzed in this paper, such as the complexation and electron transfer between sulfur-functional groups and heavy metal (e.g., Hg, Cd, and Ni) on improving biochar adsorption capacity. However, there are still challenges in directional synthesis, precise determination, and regulation of application performance. Based on the research gaps identified, future prospective investigation directions on analysis, engineering, and application of biochar S-functional groups were presented in this review.

To partly decarbonize its use, a promising technology is the production of hydrogen, easy to be mixed into the natural gas grid, or directly used in fuel cells and industrial kilns. The thermo-catalytic decomposition of CH4 into H-2 and C is gaining interest. The produced carbon black can moreover be sold as a filler. Over the past decades, several catalysts for the CH4 decomposition systems have been proposed, i.e. graphite/charcoal, metal-doped carbon catalysts, molten metals, metallic nickel, and molten Ni-Bi alloy. All these catalysts are expensive because of the constituent compounds, and have rather low decompositions efficiencies. To counteract these shortcomings, the present research investigates the use of cheaper, readily fabricated and efficient catalysts. Experiments using both a Fe/Al2O3 and Ni/MgO catalyst were performed. The Fe/Al2O3 catalyst with 20 wt% Fe-loading, can provide an 80% methane conversion at a temperature of 800 degrees C, whereas the Ni/MgO catalyst is less effective at the same temperature and residence time. The carbon formed by the CH4 decomposition accumulates within the catalyst with a progressive reduction in H-2 yield. A periodic regeneration is required. Kinetic expressions were developed and used in designing a pilot-scale reactor. A twin decomposition/regeneration fluidized bed was developed. The economy of the system is promising, with low CO2 emission and H-2 costs per kg around 1 (sic)/kg, hence competitive with the current steam reforming of methane.

This paper reveals the exergy destruction mechanism of carbon gasification through a combined analysis of the kinetic method and the energy utilization diagram (EUD). Instead of a lumped exergy destruction using the traditional "black-box" and other models, the role of each reaction in carbon gasification is revealed. The results show that the exergy destruction caused by chemical reactions accounts for 86.3% of the entire carbon gasification process. Furthermore, approximately 90.3% of exergy destruction of chemical reactions is caused by the exothermal carbon partial oxidation reaction (reaction 1), 6.0% is caused by the carbon dioxide gasification reaction (reaction 2), 2.4% is caused by the steam gasification reaction (reaction 3), and 1.3% is caused by other reactions under the base condition. With increasing O-2 content alpha and decreasing steam content beta, the proportion of exergy destruction from reaction 1 decreases due to the higher gasification temperature (a higher energy level of energy acceptor in EUD), while the proportions of other reactions increase. This shows that the chemical efficiency is optimal when the extent of reactions 1 and 3 is equal and the shift reaction extent approaches zero at the same time.

However, their energy efficiency is usually limited by poor kinetics reversibility and electrochemical activity of the redox reaction of polysulfide couples on the graphite felt electrode, which hinder its further practical applications. Here, Cu2XGeS4 (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Cd, Mn) nanocrystals are successfully synthesized through the hot injection method, and then uniformly coated onto the surface of graphite felt as electrodes. These electrodes can successfully suppress the water splitting side reactions, especially the hydrogen evolution reaction. The ones with Cu2CoGeS4 nanocrystals can significantly boost electrocatalytic activities of S2-/S-x(2-) redox reactions for the proper adsorbability of polysulfide, which inturn improve the charge transfer process and selectively facilitate the electro-conversion reactions of polysulfides. Furthermore, the polysulfide/iodide flow battery with GF-Cu2CoGeS4 generates a high energy efficiency of 77.2% at 20 mA cm(-2), a power density of 40.7 mW cm(-2) and a stable energy efficiency retention of 92% after approximately 250 continuous cycles.

In this study, MWCNTs are obtained through a modification method using a compound of nitric acid and sulfuric acid, and are then dispersed using three types of dispersants. Fly ash-based geopolymers are prepared to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of adopting 0.05 wt. %, 0.10 wt.%, and 0.15 wt.% functionalized MWCNTs and substitution ratios of 10 %-40 % of fly ash with GBFS. The structure and dispersity of the functionalized MWCNTs in aqueous solutions are characterized using FT-IR and TEM, respectively. Then, the setting time, water absorption capacity, and mechanical behaviors are evaluated. In addition, SEM-EDS, FT-IR, TG-DSC, Si-29 NMR, and XRD are employed to investigate the morphology, elemental components, mineralogical phases, and geopolymerization degree of the gel products. The experimental results show that the functionalized MWCNTs comprise COOH and OH groups and can be uniformly dispersed in aqueous solution containing SDS dispersant. Furthermore, geopolymer paste incorporated with 0.1 wt.% functionalized MWCNTs and having 30 % substitution of fly ash with GBFS exhibits a higher compressive and flexural strength and a lower water absorption capacity compared with all other geopolymer pastes.

A rigorous computational model of the ammonia regeneration process is established, based on which the ammonia regeneration and escape processes can be predicted accurately. The ammonia escape and energy penalty of the regeneration process are studied and the results show that the ammonia escape performance is controlled by the liquid film. The increasing of the liquid inlet temperature, initial ammonia concentration and CO2 loading can reduce the regeneration energy consumption obviously. Especially, the energy consumption of 343.15 K liquid inlet temperature is almost three times to that of 368.15 K liquid inlet temperature. This work can contribute to the ammonia escape inhibition and low energy consumption in the ammonia regeneration process for the industrial application of the ammonia technology.

EFFECT OF DIFFERENT PROPORTIONAL MIXTURES OF CORN STRAW AND PEAT ON HUMUS COMPOSITION AND HUMIC ACID STRUCTURE OF BLACK SOILS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						organic materials; soil organic matter; humic acid structure; elemental analysis; fluorescence spectrum	ORGANIC-CARBON; FULVIC-ACIDS; FLUORESCENCE EXCITATION; COMPONENTS; BIOCHAR; TILLAGE; REGION; MINERALIZATION; CONSERVATION; IMPROVEMENT	In order to mitigate the degradation of black soil organic matter, this paper designed a field microplot experiment with different proportional mixtures of corn straw and peat with an equal carbon amount. Treatments included (i) no organic materials applied (CK), (ii) Application of peat (P), (iii) Peat and corn straw are 2:1(2/3P), (iv) Peat and corn straw are 1:2(1/3P) and (v) Application of corn straw (0P). The humus composition and humic acid (HA) structural characteristics of black soil were studied using elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, fluorescence spectrum and thermogravimetric analysis. The results demonstrated that water-soluble substances carbon (WSS-C) content increased with the increase of straw application amount, SOC, humification rate (PQ) and carbon content of other humus fractions increased with the increase of peat application amount. In addition, the higher peat applied, the stronger the aromatic nature of HA structure, the more stable and complex the structure of HA, the higher corn straw applied, the stronger the aliphatic nature of HA structure, and the simpler the structure of HA. With the consideration of the humus composition and HA structural characteristics of black soil, the appropriate ratio of the application of corn straw and peat deemed 2:1.	[Li, S.

CO2 Activation and Total Reduction on Titanium(0001) Surface	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; ADSORPTION; ENERGY; DISSOCIATION; DYNAMICS; METALS	From first-principles simulations, we identify that CO2 is strongly activated and chemically adsorbed via both the carbon and the oxygen atoms and can totally dissociate on the Ti (0001) surface, under appropriate conditions, in contrast to relatively weak interactions of CO2 with other transition metals reported previously. This strong activation is due to the relatively small work function or electronegativity of Ti. We postulate that a structure with a smaller work function provides greater activation for CO2. The findings point to new directions for the design of efficient Ti-based alloy catalysts for CO2 capture and conversion.	[Li, S. F.; Guo, Z. X.] UCL, Dept Chem, London WC1H 0AJ, England; [Li, S.

Influence of water content on alkali metal chloride transport in cross-linked Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate.2. Ion diffusion	POLYMER			English	Article						Alkali metal chlorides; Diffusion; Hydrogel	AMMONIA-CARBON DIOXIDE; SODIUM-CHLORIDE; SULFONATED POLYMERS; ELECTROLYTES; COEFFICIENTS; MEMBRANES; PERMEABILITY; THERMODYNAMICS; COPOLYMER; OSMOSIS	In this study, the influence of polymer water content on ion diffusion coefficients of alkali metal chlorides (LiCl, NaCl, and KCl) in cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (XLPEGDA) hydrogels was investigated. This research is part of a broader effort to understand the fundamentals of water and ion transport in hydrated polymers. Salt diffusion coefficients were calculated from salt permeability and sorption measurements. XLPEGDA hydrogels were synthesized with three different water contents (50, 67, and 93 g water/g dry polymer). The diffusion coefficients of alkali metal chlorides in XLPEGDA polymers increased as water content increased. The Mackie and Meares model, which accounts for polymer chain obstruction (i.e., tortuosity) effects on salt diffusion in hydrated polymers, was used to interpret salt diffusion coefficients. The general trend of the experimentally determined salt diffusion coefficients in these polymers is consistent with the model. Individual ion diffusion coefficients in the samples were obtained by combining salt permeability/sorption data with ionic conductivity results. The chloride ion diffusion coefficients were similar for all salts. The relative order of alkali metal ion diffusion coefficients in these polymers was different from that in aqueous solution (i.e., D-K+(s) > D-Na+(s) > D-Li+(s)). Moreover, this order changes as polymer water content varies, suggesting that alkali metal chloride diffusion behavior in XLPEGDA polymers is influenced by both ion hydration and polymer-ion specific interactions.

Though, poor reversibility and electrochemical activity of the redox reaction of polysulfide couples on graphite felt electrode restricts its energy efficiency. Herein, a facile method to improve the electrocatalytic activity by fabrication of skeletal Cu7S4 hollow nanocages with copper vacancies is presented. Cu7S4 nanoparticles can selectively boost the electrocatalytic activities of S2-/S-x(2-) redox reactions and suppress the hydrogen evolution side reaction. In addition, the hollow opening structure of skeletal Cu7S4 served as the catalytic active site (both the inner side and outer surface), accelerating the electrolyte transport and promoting the charge transfer process. A sandwiched electrode was constructed by coating Cu7S4 nanocages into the interlayer of graphite felt. The polysulfide/iodide flow battery with SKE-Cu7S4 sandwich structure electrode can generate high energy efficiency of 78.5% at 20 mA cm(-2) , power density of 30.6 mW cm(-2) and a stable energy efficiency retention of 92% after approximately 200 continuous cycles suggesting their potential use for future scalable RFBs. The developing of highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for the electro-conversion of polysulfides will boost the performance and application of polysulfide-based flow batteries and other energy devices involved with polysulfides such as, quantum dots sensitized solar cells, Li-S batteries.

J	Li, S; Wang, TJ; Zhuang, BL; Xie, M; Han, Y				Li, Shu; Wang, Tijian; Zhuang, Bingliang; Xie, Min; Han, Yong			Spatiotemporal distribution of anthropogenic aerosols in China around 2030	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							REGIONAL CLIMATE; CARBONACEOUS AEROSOL; NORTH CHINA; HAZE; IMPLEMENTATION; IMPACT; MODEL; CONVECTION; EMISSIONS; SCHEME	In the context of global warming, the future spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols in China is a common concern of the government and the scientific community. In this study, the regional climate model RegCM4 is used to simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of anthropogenic aerosols including sulfate, black carbon, and organic carbon in China around 2030 under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios and estimate the contributions of climate difference, emission difference, and extra-regional transport difference to the change of anthropogenic aerosol concentration in the study area. The results show that the annual average concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols around 2030 decreased significantly with respect to those around 2010, and the decrease amplitude of black carbon surface concentration is the smallest, especially in the RCP8.5 scenario. The annual averages for sulfate, black carbon, and organic carbon surface concentrations in the central and eastern parts of China will be 8.5, 1.7, and 3.7 mu g m(-3), respectively, under the RCP4.5 scenario, whereas 10.0, 2.2, and 4.4 mu g m(-3), respectively, under the RCP8.5 scenario. The surface concentration of sulfate is higher in summer and spring, while lower in winter and autumn. The surface concentrations of black carbon and organic carbon are higher in winter and lower in other seasons. The results of sensitivity experiments demonstrate that the future difference in local emissions between RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios has the greatest impact on the anthropogenic aerosol concentrations throughout China, while the effects of future climate difference and extra-regional transport difference are much smaller around 2030. For the aerosol column burdens, the effect of future local emission difference between the two scenarios is still dominant, and the effect of extra-regional transport difference becomes very significant during spring and winter for organic carbon and black carbon. The results of this paper suggest that the impacts of future climate difference and extra-regional transport difference between RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios on anthropogenic aerosols are non-negligible in certain regions and seasons besides the impact of future local emission difference in China around 2030.

Up to date, the effect of different biochars on soil hydrophobicity remains unclear and the association of SWR with soil hydraulic properties is still unknown. To link the biochar hydrophobicity to SWR and soil water holding capacity (WHC), the surface structure and chemical composition of 27 biochars with different feedstocks and pyrolysis temperatures were characterized, and the SWR and soil WHC of biochar-added soil were investigated. Carboxylic groups on the biochar surface, surface area and pore volume were mostly influenced by pyrolysis temperature, which suggested the dominant factor determining the severity of biochar hydrophobicity was pyrolysis temperature. Hydrophilic soil became hydrophobic after biochar amendment. A higher addition rate led to a stronger SWR of hydrophilic soil. Biochar addition increased soil WHC of hydrophilic soil with low total organic carbon (TOC) content. Biochar did not have significant influence on SWR and soil WHC of hydrophobic soil with high TOC content. It implied that the influence of biochar on SWR and soil hydraulic properties mainly depended on soil original hydrophobicity and TOC content. Therefore, the properties of biochar and influence on soil hydrophobicity and hydraulic properties should be considered before processing biochar application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, graphene oxide (GO)-gold nanoparticle (Au NP) assemblies are driven by a splint DNA strand, which is designed with two regions at both ends that are complementary with the DNA sequence anchored on the surface of the GO and the Au NPs. In the presence of microRNA (miR)-21 and epithelial cell-adhesion molecule (EpCAM), the hybridization of miR-21 with a molecular probe leads to the separation of 6-fluorescein-phosphoramidite-modified Au NPs from GO, resulting in a decrease in the Raman signal, while EpCAM recognition reduces circular dichroism (CD) signals. The CD signals reverse from negative in original assemblies into positive when reacted with cells, which correlates with two enantiomer geometries. The EpCAM detection has a good linear range of 8.47-74.78 pg mL(-1) and a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.63 pg mL(-1), whereas miR-21 detection displays an outstanding linear range of 0.07-13.68 amol ng(RNA)(-1) and LOD of 0.03 amol ng(RNA)(-1). All the results are in good agreement with those of the Raman and confocal bioimaging. The strategy opens up an avenue to allow the highly accurate and reliable diagnosis (dual targets) of clinic diseases.

Their microstructures and compositions were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy. All the nanocatalysts show a homogeneous distribution of ultra-small alloy nanoparticles (similar to 2-3 nm) on the surface of carbon black. The electrochemical results indicate that FePtSn/C nanocatalysts have more excellent catalytic activity for methanol oxidation compared with Pt/C catalyst. Chronoamperometry measurements were performed at 0.45 V for 3600 s. At 3600 s, the mass specific activity of FePtSn/C (Sn at% = 14) can retain 103 mAmgpt(-1), about 10 times higher than that of Pt/C catalyst (10 mAmgpt-1). The CO-stripping tests indicate that FePtSn/C (Sn at%= 14) nanocatalysts preserve a high electrochemical active specific surface and a higher ability to resist poisons, thus making the FePtSniC (Sn at%=14) catalyst an excellent electrocatalyst for direct methanol fuel cells.

In order to reveal the mechanism of red mud carbon thermal reduction process, isothermal reduction experiments on carbon-bearing pellets of red mud were investigated with biomass carbon as a reducing agent. In this study, the reduction temperatures were conducted using a microwave stove in the temperature range from 850 to 1250 degrees C, and the C/O molar ratio was 1.1. The results show that the reduction process of red mud is governed by a carbon gasification reaction, and the apparent activation energy is 88.44 kJ/mol. The optimum reduction process conditions were established to be 1150 degrees C for 13 min. [GRAPHICS] .

Further improving their intrinsic activity and selectivity by tuning their N-M bond structures and coordination is limited. Herein, we expand the coordination environments of M-N-C catalysts by designing dual-metal active sites. The Ni-Fe catalyst exhibited the most efficient CO2RR activity and promising stability compared to other combinations. Advanced structural characterization and theoretical prediction suggest that the most active N-coordinated dual-metal site configurations are 2N-bridged (Fe-Ni)N-6, in which FeN4 and NiN4 moieties are shared with two N atoms. Two metals (i.e., Fe and Ni) in the dual-metal site likely generate a synergy to enable more optimal *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption than single-metal sites (FeN4 or NiN4) with improved intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity.

This study examined the novel photoautotrophic H-2 production of Rhodobacter sphaeroides with concomitant CO2 uptake in microbial electrosynthesis (MES). Under an applied potential of -0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl to the cathode, Rhodobacter sphaeroides produced hydrogen with CO2 as the sole carbon source under illumination. The initial planktonic cells decreased rapidly in suspension, whereas biomass formation on the cathode surface increased gradually during MES operation. The electron and carbon flow under photoautotrophic conditions in MES were estimated. Glutamate, as the nitrogen source, enhanced hydrogen production significantly (328 mL/L/day) compared to NH4Cl (67 mL/L/day) during seven days of operation. The photoautotrophic condition with 6000 lx presented CO2 consumption and simultaneous biomass formation on the cathode electrode. MES-driven electron and proton transfer enabled the simultaneous production of hydrogen and CO2 uptake.

Nonetheless, dendritic Li deposition has dramatically hindered the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Uniformizing Li deposition is a prerequisite to achieve safe and practical LMBs. Herein, an underpotential deposition (UPD) process is first proposed to alter the kinetic and uniformity of Li deposition morphology. Based on the strong interaction between the Li adatoms and manganese (Mn) based substrate, a competition between the UPD and bulk Li deposition is observed, on which the predominance of the UPD scenario tends to uniformize Li nucleation and deposition by the surface coverage of Li monolayers at potentials that are more positive than the Nernst potential of Li metal. Inspired by this process, an advanced hybrid Mn-graphene oxide structure is developed for Li protection, not only enabling dendrite-free Li anodes for high-capacity and-current density cycling, but also improving the interfacial kinetic of Li metal anodes at subzero temperatures, showing potential applicability in low temperature conditions.

Functionalized with surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) are synchronously grafted with ZrO2 nanoparticles to develop into the as prepared nano-composite (ZrO2-SDS-SWCNTs). Compared to the previous reports related with hyperin detection, the linear range gets wider and detection limit (LOD) becomes lower with the aid of this novel nano composite modified glassy carbon electrode (ZrO2-SDS-SWCNTs/GCE). The crystalline phases and functionalization of the preparation process has been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) instrument analysis, respectively, and the micro-morphology of related modified materials is also visibly characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). In addition, electrochemical properties of the modified materials are comparably explored by means of impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammograms (CV). According to the established calibration curve under optimized condition, the peak current (Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal) keeps a linear relationship with hyperin concentration in the ranges of 1.0 x 10(-9) - 3.0 x 10(-7) mol L-1, meanwhile detection limit reaches as low as 5 x 10(-10) mol L-1 (S/N = 3). As for practical applications, the proposed sensor has also worked well on sensitive hyperin determination in real species Abelmoschus manihot.

The gasification behavior was investigated in a CO2 atmosphere using a thermogravimetry (TG)-mass spectrometry (MS) (TG-MS) system. A settling furnace was used to simulate CVCF to investigate the effects of gasification temperatures. The activation energy (E) was calculated using the Flynn-Wall-Ozaw (FWO) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods. The main components in the gas phase were typically CO, CH4, H-2, H2O, and C2H6 in a tem-perature range of 300 degrees C-50 0 degrees C. The average activation energy of waste tire decomposition was 144.51 kJ/mol. The increase in temperature and decrease in particle size increased the amount of combustible gas and LHV value. The increase in the CO2/CO ratio decreased the content of residual coke from 12.62% to 11.98%. The lower heating values were determined to range between 8.75 and 10.27 MJ/Nm(3). The research preliminarily confirmed the feasibility of injecting waste tire powders into the CVCF to generate gaseous fuels using waste heat via CO2 gasification. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, novel and environmental-friendly photocatalyst Fe3O4/BiOBr/CQDs decorated by corncob biomass carbon quantum dots (CQDs) was fabricated successfully via photoinduced method for the first time. More CQDs as electrons reservoir were deposited on the (1 1 0) facet of BiOBr by photoinduced strategy compared to common hydrolysis method through morphology observation. Besides, enhanced visible light absorption and photogenerated charge transfer efficiency make Fe3O4/BiOBr/CQDs perform best photocatalytic activity towards carbamazepine (CBZ, 10 mg/L) removal, where 99.52% CBZ could be eliminated within 120 min light irradiation. Moreover, center dot O-2(-), h(+) and .OH dominated the photodegradation process and three detailed degradation pathways depicted the transformation behavior of CBZ, which were mainly attributed to Z-scheme structure construction caused by electronic bridging and up-conversion photoluminescence of biomass CQDs. A series of photoelectrochemical tests verified the existence of CQDs and Fe3O4 solved the high charge recombination rate and low electron utilization problems of BiOBr indeed. Combined with the rational utilization of corncob waste biomass, this research indicates green photocatalyst Fe3O4/BiOBr/CQDs synthesized by photoinduced method will have wide potential in water pollutant treatment in the future.

Facile and scalable synthesis of these 2D ultrathin nanosheets, however, is still a great challenge. Here, we report a liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) method to synthesize single- and few-layer TM (oxy)hydroxide and oxide nanosheets (beta-Ni(OH)(2), delta-FeOOH, beta-CoOOH, and monoclinic LixMnO2) with high-yield and rapid procedure. In the LPE synthesis, the preformed Li2O2 nanosheets with (001) exposed planes function as substrates, enabling the epitaxial growth of TM hydroxides with coherent interface. The final TM (oxy)hydroxides and oxides ultrathin nanosheets can be obtained by in situ oxidation and removal of Li2O2 with simple distilled water washing. To demonstrate their potential applications, the obtained single- and few-layer beta-Ni(OH)(2) ultrathin nanosheets are coupled with functionalized graphene sheets (FGS), and tested as catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and as cathodes for alkaline Ni/Fe battery. Importantly, the single-layer beta-Ni(OH)(2)/FGS composite electrode exhibits excellent catalytic performance for OER and superior charge storage capability for Ni/Fe battery. The present work provides new opportunity for the high-yield synthesis of 2D materials for energy-related applications and beyond.

Therefore, in the present paper, carbon fibers (CFs) were modified by biomimetic polydopamine (PDA) and amino silane (KH550) to improve interfacial bonding strength with epoxy (EP) substrate. The grafting of PDA and KH550 was divided into "PDA", "PDA-KH550" and "(PDA + KH550)" methods for regulating interfacial compatibility and exploring the reaction mechanism. Improved interfacial strength was beneficial to transfer stress from the matrix to fillers. Consequently, mechanical properties of modified CF/EP were obviously superior to those of unmodified EP/CF. Besides, wear resistance of EP/CF-(PDA + KH550) had an increase of 76%, 67%, 60% and 49% compared to that of EP, CF/EP, CF-PDA/EP and EP/CF-PDA-KH550.

Here we describe a low-cost and high-temperature rechargeable iron-oxygen battery containing a bi-phase electrolyte of molten carbonate and solid oxide. This new design merges the merits of a solid-oxide fuel cell and molten metal-air battery, offering significantly improved battery reaction kinetics and power capability without compromising the energy capacity. The as-fabricated battery prototype can be charged at high current density, and exhibits excellent stability and security in the highly charged state. It typically exhibits specific energy, specific power, energy density, and power density of 129.1 Wh kg(-1), 2.8 kW kg(-1), 388.1 Wh L-1, and 21.0 kW L-1, respectively, based on the mass and volume of the molten salt.

However, magnesium sulfur batteries are still in a very early stage of research and development, and the discovery of suitable electrolytes is the key challenge for further improvement. Here, a new preparation method for non-nucleophilic electrolyte solutions using a two-step reaction in one-pot is presented, which provides a feasible way to optimize the physiochemical properties of the electrolyte for the application in magnesium sulfur batteries. The first use of modified electrolytes in glymes and binary solvents of glyme and ionic liquid shows beneficial effects on the performance of magnesium sulfur batteries. New insights into the reaction mechanism of electrochemical conversion between magnesium and sulfur are also investigated.

This also provides new insights into the construction of novel nanoelectronics and nanophotonics through the assembly of nanosheets. Here we present a simple exfoliation-and-reassembly approach to produce a flexible n-type TiS2/organic hybrid film for low-temperature thermoelectric applications. The obtained film shows a superlattice structure with alternative layers of TiS2 and organic molecules. Charge transfer occurs when TiS2 and organic molecules form intercalation complexes, which gives rise to a high electrical conductivity but a low Seebeck coefficient. However, the power factor can be further enhanced by annealing the film under vacuum, and the value reaches 210 mu W m(-1) K-2 at room temperature in this study. Our flexible thermoelectric device can generate a high power density of 2.5 W m(-2) at a temperature gradient of 70 K, which hits a new record among organic-based thermoelectric devices.

Se is chemically and electrochemically analogous to S to a large extent but is saliently featured owing to its semiconductivity, compatibility with carbonate-based electrolytes, and activity with a Na anode. Despite only short-term studies, many advanced Se-based electrode materials have been developed for rechargeable Li batteries, Na batteries, and Li ion batteries. In this Perspective, we review the advances in Se-based energy storage materials and the challenges of Li-Se battery in both carbonate-based and ether-based electrolytes. We also discuss the rational design strategies for future Se-based energy storage systems based on the strengths and weaknesses of Se.

Herein, we report a novel electrolytic cell in which the Si electrode can be prelithiated in a well-controlled manner from Li-containing aqueous solution in a Li-metal-free way. MnOx/Si and S/Si Li-ion full cells were assembled by using the prelithiated Si negative electrodes, which resulted in high specific energies of 349 and 732 Whkg(-1), respectively. The MnOx/Si full cell still retains 138 Whkg(-1) even at a high specific power of 1710 Wkg(-1). This is the first report of a whole process of making a full Li-ion battery with both Li-deficient electrodes without the use of Li metal as the Li source. This novel prelithiation process, with high controllability, no short circuiting, and an abundant Li source, is expected to contribute significantly to the development of safe, green, and powerful Li-ion batteries.

These intriguing attributes, to a large extent, stem from the nature of incorporated ligands. The available ligands for the construction of 2D conjugated MOFs are still limited, especially those that have heteroatoms included and exposed to the pores. In this work, we designed and synthesized a highly symmetric hexaazatrinaphthylene (HATNA)-based ligand with two different coordination sites. Through selective coordination, a highly crystalline and porous 2D conjugated copper metal-organic framework was constructed. Due to the synergic effects of HATNA and copper catecholate node, this HATNA-based 2D conjugated MOF can mediate the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane with high selectivity of 78 % at high current density of 8.2 milliamperes per square centimetre (mA cm(-2)) for long durability over 12 hours.

The adsorption behaviour of CH(4)and CO(2)in shale is the key to evaluate the efficiency of CH(4)production and potential of CO(2)sequestration. In the present work, the cylindrical and slit kerogen nanopores were constructed to represent the realistic organic nanopores existing in shale matrix. The adsorption behaviours of pure CH(4)and CO2/CH(4)mixture were investigated by employing the grand canonical Monte Carlo method. The results indicate that the adsorption capacities of CH(4)in shale kerogen nanopores increase with the increment of pressure. However, temperature exhibits a negative impact on the gas adsorption capacity. The effects of pressure, temperature on competitive adsorption performances of CO2/CH(4)mixture were discussed. It is found that the adsorption capacities of CO(2)are significantly higher than that of CH(4)at various pressure and temperature conditions. Both the adsorption capacity and selectivity should be taken into consideration to determine the proper conditions in the practical project.

It was found that HAAs in water increased due to prechlorination and postchlorination. The conventional treatment processes removed the HAAs in less than 20%. By comparison, activated carbon bed removed 49-86% of HAAs and was considered to be an effective treatment unit for HAAs removal. The HAAs concentration in distribution system was associated with water sources, especially the total organic carbon in raw water, while its fluctuation appeared small.

The composites were fabricated by dispersing chopped carbon fibers into bimodal SiC/C suspension, forming green body through slip casting, and then reaction sintering at 1700 degrees C. The effect of the chopped fiber fraction on microstructure and mechanical properties was evaluated. A significant increase of fracture toughness was obtained as the carbon fiber fraction approaches 30 vol.%. The chopped fibers had reacted with liquid silicon during reaction sintering, so little fiber pullout was observed. Crack deflection and bridging is the predominant mechanism for the composite toughening. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

The major content of this article is the laboratory calibration of HRHS-GS, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), instrument line shape (ILS), and the spectral resolution of each channel were achieved. The SNR results met the mission requirements for the 0.76 mu m band, but missed the requirement for the two Carbon dioxide (CO2) bands. To address this problem, the model 'Multiplex Merging of Spectral Pixels' was established to improve the SNR by increasing the incident energy of a single spectral channel. This process would lead to spectral broadening; the spectral resolution before and after that process was obtained. The transmittance spectra before and after multiplex merging were compared by the line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM) to analyse the impact of spectral broadening on gas absorption lines. Next, the results were verified by experiment with a gas absorption cell. The results showed that 'Multiplex Merging of Spectral Pixels' could effectively improve the SNR. For the 0.76 mu m band, the transmittance spectra before and after multiplex merging were almost the same; for the 1.61 mu m band, the peak value of the transmittance spectra decays by about 5%; and for the 2.06 mu m band, the attenuation of the transmittance spectra is smaller than 3%. Meanwhile, the spectral resolution after spectral broadening still satisfied the study's requirement.

In this work, a hydrochar microsphere-mediated photocatalyst Fe3O4/BiO-Br@HC with rapid surface catalytic reaction and electron transfer was fabricated. Under visible-LED-light irradiation, removal of refractory analgesic carbamazepine (CBZ) and total organic carbon (TOC) reached 100% and 67.41%, respectively, by Fe3O4/BiOBr@HC20% within 40 min, demonstrating the excellent photocatalytic activity compared to other photocatalysts. The narrower band gap (2.02 eV) of Fe3O4/BiOBr@HC obviously improved the visible light absorption. The hydrochar with abundant surface oxygen functional groups provided more active oxygen species .O-2(-) (4.05 mu M) and .OH (107.8 nM), and acted as an electron bridge to promote the electron transfer of BiOBr and Fe3O4. Eleven main CBZ intermediates were identified and three degradation pathways were proposed to illustrate the contribution of superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and photo generated holes to the photodegradation of CBZ. Furthermore, five-cycle reusing experiments revealed that Fe3O4/BiOBr@HC composite catalysts have excellent reusability and stability, indicating that they have a promising application future.

Although versatile synthetic strategies have been developed, the search for a sustainable and reliable approach is still extremely desirable for achieving new polymeric species according to the demands for environmental benignity and biocompatibility. Here, we present the synthesis of a new family of olefin-linked conjugated porous polymers by the Knoevenagel condensation of a key monomer 1,1 ',6,6 '-tetramethyl-[3,3 '-bipyridine]-1,1 '-diium iodide (TMBPI) with different aryl aldehyde derivatives. In such a strategy, the methyl groups of pyridinium moieties were facile to be activated under organic base catalysis without any metal additives, and they subsequently undergo nucleophilic addition to form aldehyde groups. The resulting carbon-carbon double bond-linked porous polymers feature pi-extended rigid networks, ultra-high chemical stability, and high surface areas with micro-/meso-channels, which were completely revealed by optical spectra, solid-state C-13 NMR, FT-IR, thermogravimetry, XPS and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analyses. In addition, the unique highly charged skeletons of the as-prepared porous polymers make them well dispersed in some polar solvents, showing large zeta potentials (up to zeta = 16 +/- 2.8 mV). Accordingly, such cationic porous polymers enable impeding bacterial growth, exhibiting good antibacterial properties against Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. E. coli).

In addition, ZL was characterized with solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (SS C-13 NMR), Raman spectrometer and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XRPES), while the extracts were analyzed with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer along with a positive-ion (PI) and negative-ion (NI) electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (ESIFTICRMS). According to the characterization with SS C-13 NMR, aliphatic carbons count for 59.5% of all the organic carbons in ZL, and each aromatic cluster contains 2 or 3 aromatic rings on average. The pyrrolic nitrogen and sulfones are the most abundant nitrogen and sulfur forms, respectively, in ZL based on the analysis with XRPES. ESIFTICRMS resolved thousands of basic and non-basic species, and the molecular masses are mainly concentrated in the range of 350-600 and 300-500 u, respectively. Acidic S1O3 class species with double bond equivalent values of 3-8 and carbon numbers of 6-39 are dominant species and could be attributed to acidic group-substituted thiophenes. Main nitrogen-containing species detected in the PI mode are basic N1O0-3, N2S2, and N2O1-8S1-2. Most of the species were speculated to contain some core structures, such as pyridines, pyrimidines, or pyrazines.

The results show that the retained austenite continues to transform into martensite almost but not complete at low temperature. The topography of retained austenite exhibits as a nanoscale thin film with a thickness range of 20-60 nm between the martensite laths. The changes of internal friction peaks have been explained well by the coupling model, which indicates that deep cryotreatment is not only removing retained austenite but also promoting the interstitial carbon atoms segregated to nearby dislocations under the shrinking strain energy. In addition, more carbides precipitated from the matrix during tempering in cryotreated samples and were verified by analyses of transmission electron microscopy.

The Raman scattering cross section of the fundamentals in the liquid (293-213 K) and solid phases (188-83 K) increases as temperature decreases and the Raman bandwidths decreases. An intriguing phenomenon is that the Raman scattering cross section of the carbon-carbon single and double bonds in solution with iodine decreases and the Raman bandwidths increases, compared with the one without iodine. These phenomena are analyzed using the coherent weakly damped electron-lattice vibration mode. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

However, due to the weak particle-to-particle connection and the easily falling-off nature of nano-/micro-size Ag powder, the manufacturing of stretchable high-performance Zn-Ag batteries remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel one-pot self-assembled Ag nanowire (AgNW) aerogel cathode with ultra-high electric conductivity (>7 x 10(5) S m(-1), much higher than that of most current collectors), and thereby construct an intrinsically 500% super-stretchable Zn-Ag battery. The multi-directional growth and self-assembly of AgNWs are enabled in one facile polyol reaction, as such AgNW aerogel is produced conveniently without traditional pre-synthesis of AgNW monomers and subsequent high-temperature sintering. The as-fabricated Zn-Ag battery delivers a high energy density of 3.15 mW h cm(-2) and a power density of 6.84 mW cm(-2) with stable voltage and capacity output as well as excellent mechanical durability under heavy deformation, benefiting from the abundant electron-transport paths of AgNWs. With all these findings, this work will facilitate the application of stretchable energy storage/conversion systems, and the proposed ultra-high electrically conductive AgNW aerogel can also be a potential electrode or carrier with excellent performance and stability for stretchable and wearable electronics.

However, the global demonstration of CCUS has not gone well for several reasons. Multiple technical options, diverse combinations of schemes and complex evaluation systems of CCUS are crucial reasons. Another key point is the diverse concerns of key stakeholders involved in the deployment of CCUS, leading to decision-making difficulties. Thus, in this paper, with the aid of the analytic hierarchy process method, five representative cases are defined, compared and evaluated from the technical, economic and policy perspectives. The evaluation results and corresponding interpretations are given from diverse perspectives. By adopting this evaluation method and establishing a comprehensive model, decision makers can clarify their requirements, carry out multi-dimensional evaluation, and obtain inspiration to make corresponding judgements or de-cisions for early CCUS demonstration projects, which is conducive to promoting the progress of CCUS demonstration projects.

The way in which the conditions of hydrothermal treatment (180 and 200 degrees C) and thermal treatment (500 degrees C) affect the physicochemical properties of the products was determined. A physicochemical analysis of the fabricated materials included the determination of the microstructure and morphology (scanning and transmission electron microscopy-SEM and TEM), crystalline structure (X-ray diffraction method-XRD), chemical surface composition (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy-EDS) and parameters of the porous structure (low-temperature N(2)sorption), as well as the chemical surface concentration (X-ray photoelectron spectroscop-XPS). It is well known that lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) represent a renewable energy source and a type of energy storage device. The increased demand for energy means that new materials with higher energy and power densities continue to be the subject of investigation. The objective of this research was to obtain a new electrode (anode) component characterized by high work efficiency and good electrochemical properties. The synthesized TiO2-MoS(2)material exhibited much better electrochemical stability than pure MoS2(commercial), but with a specific capacity ca. 630 mAh/g at a current density of 100 mA/g.

Cyclic voltammograms for nickel(II) salen in the presence of (bromomethyl) cyclopropane exhibit characteristic features for the catalytic reduction of the substrate. Bulk electrolyses of (bromomethyl) cyclopropane at carbon cathodes in dimethylformamide catalyzed by nickel(II) salen were carried out to investigate the mechanism for the formation of dialkylated nickel(II) salen, which was analyzed and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The corresponding dialkylated nickel(II) salen was further purified and collected by preparative-scale HPLC. Its complete structure was revealed by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), H-1 NMR, COSY, and HECTOR NMR spectrometry. The clear-cut reaction mechanism for its formation was proposed on the basis of current and previous studies. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.

Used as a cathode material, it possesses a high capacity (1196 mAh g(-1)@0.3 A g(-1)@1.6 mg cm(-2)), excellent charging-discharging rate (680 mAh g(-1)@7.5 A g(-1)) and long-life performance (maintaining 71.1% capacity over 450 cycles), which is mainly attributed to the benefits of excellent electronic/Li-ionic dual-conductivity and confinement effect of the 3D-hybrid N-GO/CNT framework coated by self-doping conducting polymer SPANI. Thus, a 3D sulfur cathode modified with electronic/Li-ionic dual-conduction network can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance and stability, and this novel type of material is very promising for commercial applications that require high energy and power density, long life, and excellent abuse tolerance.

Here, a strategy is developed to prepare flexible all-in-one integrated supercapacitors by combining all-freeze-casting with typography technique. The continuous seamless connection of all-in-one supercapacitor devices enhances the load and/or electron transfer capacity and avoids displacing and detaching between their neighboring components at bending status. Therefore, such a unique structure of all-in-one integrated devices is beneficial for retaining stable electrochemical performance at different bending levels. More importantly, the sizes and aesthetic shapes of integrated supercapacitors could be controlled by the designed molds, like type matrices of typography. The molds could be assembled together and typeset randomly, achieving the controllable construction and series and/or parallel connection of several supercapacitor devices. The preparation of flexible integrated supercapacitors will pave the way for assembling programmable all-in-one energy storage devices into highly flexible electronics.

However, the large volume expansion, the great structural pulverization, and the slow electronic transmission have been the foremost obstacles to their further applications. Here, Sb2S3@SnS@C nanocomposites with a hollow-tube-heterostructure were constructured to mitigate the above problems. As the anode materials, the Sb2S3@SnS@C nanocomposites can deliver a high capacity of 442 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 A g(-1) and excellent rate capacity of 448 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1). Besides, a capacity of 200 mA h g(-1) could be detected with a superior cycling performance of 1300 cycles at 5.0 A g(-1). The outstanding cycle stability could be ascribed to the inner hollow tube structure and the protection of the outer carbon layer, which together maintain the stability of the structure jointly. Moreover, the internal electric field generated by the heterojunction of Sb2S3 and SnS promotes the electronic transmission and ion diffusion, resulting in good electrochemical performances.

The results showed that after the reduction roasting of the carbon-bearing red mud pellets at 1100-1200 degrees C for 12-20 min, the metallic pellets were obtained with the metallization ratio of >= 88%. Then, the separation of slag and iron achieved from the metallic pellets at 1550 degrees C, after composition adjustment targeting the primary crystal region of the 12CaO center dot 7Al(2)O(3) phase. After iron removal and composition adjustment, the smelting-separation slag had good smelting performance and desulfurization capability, which meets the demand of sulfurization flux in steel making process. The pig iron quality meets the requirements of the high-quality raw material for steel making. In virtue of the huge scale and output of steel industry, the large-scale consumption and zero-waste recycling method of red mud was proposed, which comprised of the carbon-bearing red mud pellets roasting in the rotary hearth furnace and smelting separation in the electric arc furnace after composition adjustment.

A dense amorphous material was obtained through a hot-pressing method. The SiC/SiCN glass had nanocrystalline beta-SiC dispersed in SiCN phase as the low crystallization temperature of the pyrolyzed residues of PCS. Elevated heating treatment caused slight enlargement of beta-SiC and no Si3N4 crystallites were detected. The SiC/SiCN glass had a significant improvement in the elastic modulus and hardness compared with the amorphous material. The free carbon in amorphous glass rearranged to graphite-like layers at higher temperatures and the mechanical properties of SiC/SiCN glass degraded.

The products were characterized by some advanced analytical methods. Thermodynamics and reaction kinetics of thermochemical sulfate reduction processes had been investigated on the basis of the experimental data. The results showed that thermochemical sulfate reduction of natural gas with magnesium sulphate could proceed at 425 degrees C-525 degrees C to produce magnesium oxide, carbon, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide as the main products. The reactions are thermochemically possible and high temperature is favored. Long-chain hydrocarbons more easily thermodynamically participate in the reactions than short-chain hydrocarbons. According to the reaction model, the calculated activation energy for the reaction between natural gas and magnesium sulfate is about 78.975 kJ/mol.

The interlayer contain a large number of carboxyl groups, which could improve not only the negative potential of interlayer, but also the positive potential of the PA layer because of the increase of unreacted -NH2. In addition, the hydrophilic of interlayer was stronger than the PA layer. Therefore, the interlayer and the ultra-thin PA layer could construct a double Janus NF membrane with hydrophobic/hydrophilic, positive/negative charge. It was found that the content of carboxyl groups and unreacted amino groups on the surface of Janus PES/CNC-COOH/PA NF membrane was increased obviously. The thickness of Janus NF membrane PA layer was 60.29 nm, 55.56% thinner than that in traditional PES/PA NF membrane and 25.89% thinner than that in weak Janus PES/cellulose nanocrystal/PA NF membrane. The Janus NF membrane had a minimum average surface roughness of 6.21 nm, an effective pore diameter of 1.38 nm, and exhibited a positive surface charge with a highly hydrophilic nature. Under the Mg2+/Li+ ratio of 30 and 60, the Janus NF membrane exhibited the rejection difference between Mg2+ and Li+ reached to 74.35% and 83.96%, the water flux was 4.17 and 3.4 L/(m(2).h.bar), respectively, and the separation factor S-Li,S-Mg was 12.15 and 5.84, respectively.

Herein, an environmentallyfriendly foaming process with CO2 as blowing agents was developed for fabricating structure-gradient thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) foams. In the unique microcellular foaming process, a two-step sorption procedure with a low CO2 pressure at the first stage and a high CO2 pressure at the second stage was used to generate gradient CO2 concentration in the solid TPU samples, which results in gradient cellular morphology in TPU foams. By varying the second sorption time, TPU foams with various gradient cellular morphology were prepared. Interestingly, the gradient cellular morphology helped to increase compression strength by 71.4% and modulus by 113.8%, to enhance resilience with a 24.7% reduction in energy loss coefficient and a rebound coefficient of 61.4%, and also to benefit shape-recovery after long compression deformation.

Co-digestion of microalgae with potato processing waste and glycerol: effect of glycerol addition on methane production and the microbial community	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; METHANOGENIC POPULATION; BIOGAS PRODUCTION; ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; WATER TREATMENT; CRUDE GLYCEROL; START-UP; STRATEGIES; AMMONIA; MANURE	The production of methane-rich biogas from the anaerobic digestion (AD) of microalgae is limited by an unfavorable biomass carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio; however, this may be ameliorated using a co-digestion strategy with carbon-rich feedstocks. For reliable plant operation, and to improve the economics of the process, secure co-feedstock supply (ideally as a waste-stream) is important. To this end, this study investigated the feasibility of co-digesting microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) with potato processing waste (potato discarded parts, PPWdp; potato peel, PPWp) and glycerol, while monitoring the response of the methanogenic community. In this semi-continuous study, glycerol (1 and 2% v/v) added to mixtures ofC. vulgaris : PPW(dp)enhanced the specific methane yields the most, by 53-128%, whilst co-digestion with mixtures ofC. vulgaris : PPW(p)enhanced the methane yields by 62-74%. The microbial communities diverged markedly over operational time, and to a lesser extent in response to glycerol addition. The acetoclastMethanosaetawas abundant in all treatments but was replaced byMethanosarcinain the potato peel with glycerol treatment due to volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that the performance of microalgae co-digestion is substantially improved by the addition of glycerol as an additional co-feedstock. This should improve the economic case for anaerobically digesting microalgae as part of wastewater treatment processes and/or the terminal step of a microalgae biorefinery.

Variation of NEE and its affecting factors in a vineyard of arid region of northwest China	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Net ecosystem CO2 exchange; Eddy covariance; Vineyards; Arid region	CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; EDDY COVARIANCE; FOREST; FLUX; TEMPERATE; ECOSYSTEM; BALANCE; SEASON; BUDGET	To understand the variation of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in orchard ecosystem and it's affecting factors, carbon flux was measured using eddy covariance system in a wine vineyard in arid northwest China during 2008-2010. Results show that vineyard NEE was positive value at the early growth stage, higher negative value at the mid-growth stage, and lower negative value at the later growth stage. Diurnal variation of NEE was "W" shaped curve in sunny day, but "U" shaped curve in cloudy day. Irrigation and pruning did not affect diurnal variation shape of NEE, however, irrigation reduced the difference between maximal and minimal value of NEE and pruning reduced the carbon sink capacity. The main factors affecting hourly NEE were canopy conductance (gc) and net radiation (R-n). The hourly NEE increased with the increase of gc or Rn when gc was less than 0.02 m . s(-1) or R-n was between 0 and 200 W . m(-2). The main factors affecting both daily and seasonal NEE were gc, air temperature (T-a), atmospheric CO2 density, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture content. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, Prussian blue@polyaniline nanocube is synthesized by an aqueous precipitation method and the following polymerization process of aniline. Benefiting from the coordinating role of polyvinyl pyrrolidone between Prussian blue and polyaniline, Prussian blue@polyaniline nanocube presents a core-shell structure with a diameter of about 600 nm and the uniform polyaniline coating layer is averagely 20 nm in thickness. The incorporation of polyaniline on Prussian blue is efficient to enhance the electrical conductivity and the kinetics of Na+ transmission during cycling, leading to the higher specific capacity and better rate performance. The sodium storage properties of the cathode are also investigated in different voltage ranges. Owing to the core-shell structure and the optimized voltage range, Prussian blue@polyaniline electrode delivers a specific capacity of 108.3 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) with a capacity retention of 93.4% after 500 cycles and maintains a considerable specific capacity of 90.3 mAh g(-1) even at 2 A g(-1) in the voltage range of 2.0-3.6 V. The strategy of polyvinyl pyrrolidone assisted polymerization of polyaniline layer on Prussian blue nanoparticles can be extended to surface modification for other electrode materials.

It utilizes a partial gas saturation technique to obtain non-equilibrium gas concentration profiles in thermoplastic polymer. Once foamed the polymer material obtains a graded foam-solid-foam structure with varying pore size distributions. This functionally graded material fabrication method was studied with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) under a ScCO2 saturation condition. A diffusion model was developed to estimate the gas diffusion coefficient and to predict the gas concentration profiles inside the polymer samples. Scanning electron microscopy images were used to analyze the effects of partial saturation on the graded porous structure. Mechanical properties of the foamed samples were characterized using a three-point bending test. It was found that the gas concentration profiles resulted from partial saturation corresponded well to the graded structure after foaming. The proportion of the foam and solid regions inside the polymer sample can be manipulated by controlling the partial saturation profile. The test results also suggested that the graded foam structure could be optimized to achieve desirable mechanical properties. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Metabolic characteristics of microbial communities of Aeolian sandy soils induced by saline water drip irrigation in shelter forests	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							PROFILES; PATTERNS; ECO	The microbial metabolic activities of soils sampled at eight depths (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-50, 50-70, 70-100, 100-150 and 150-200cm) in shelter forests (comprising the tree species, Haloxylon sp.) along the Tarim Desert Highway under drip irrigation with different saline waters were investigated by using Biolog technology. Variance analysis and principal component analysis were conducted. The average well colour development (AWCD) values for single carbon source use by microorganisms increased with the incubation time. The microorganisms reached a lag phase within 24hours of incubation and entered exponential and stationary phases after 48 and 216hours of incubation, respectively; however, the death phase was not obvious. As the salinity of drip irrigation water increased, the AWCD values significantly decreased; the AWCD value in the land drip-irrigated with lowest saline water (S8) was roughly 20% larger than that of the land drip-irrigated with highest saline water (S1), which was mainly caused by the differences in the use of carboxylic acids, amino acids and phenolic compounds by soil microorganisms. The vertical differences in carbon source utilization by soil microbial communities were obvious: these may be caused by the vertical differences in soil organism abundance associated with distribution of roots in the shelter forest. The largest and smallest AWCD values were noted in the 70-100-cm soil layer and 0-5-cm topsoil layer, respectively. The correlation coefficients between the AWCD values and soil organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, available potassium, available phosphorus, pH, cation exchange capacity and bulk density were >0.85. Thus, the differences in carbon source metabolism activities of soil microorganisms were caused mainly by the soil chemical properties, with total nutrients being the main driving factor. Furthermore, the amounts of carboxylic acids, amino acids and polymers provided sensitive markers for distinguishing the ability of soil microorganisms to use carbon sources under drip irrigation with different saline waters. Saline water irrigation affected the soil microbial community in shelter forest and produced obvious differences among the shelter forests irrigated with different saline waters.

To improve the energy density and safety of lithium-ion batteries, research on new materials is urgent. Cu2S has attracted the attention of researchers for its excellent physicochemical properties. It not only has an excellent reversibility of electrochemical lithium storage with high energy density but also has a low manufacturing cost. The electrolyte is responsible for transporting electrons and ions in the lithium battery. It is one of the important modules of the battery and has an important impact on the electrochemical performance of the battery. At present, there is very little research on the suitable electrolytes for Cu2S. The effects of different types of ether electrolytes on the electrochemical performance of Cu2S are studied in this paper. In addition, an activation process of the Cu2S electrode material during the initial cycles is also studied.

Recent experimentshave identified a carbon impurity as a possible source of UV single-photon emission. Here, onthe basis offirst-principles calculations, we systematically evaluate the ability of substitutionalcarbon defects to develop the UV color centers in hBN. Of 17 defect configurations underconsideration, we particularly emphasize the carbon ring defect (6C), for which the calculatedzero-phonon line agrees well the experimental 4.1 eV emission signal. We also compare theoptical properties of 6C with those of other relevant defects, thereby outlining the keydifferences in the emission mechanism.

Here, inspired by the recent discovery of 2D ferromagnets Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), we applied the real-time density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) to study photoinduced interlayer spin transfer dynamics in 2D nonmagnetic-ferromagnetic (NM-FM) vdW heterostructures, including graphene-FGT, silicene-FGT, germanene-FGT, antimonene-FGT and h-BN-FGT interfaces. We observed that laser pulses induce significant large spin injection from FGT to nonmagnetic (NM) layers within a few femtoseconds. In addition, we identified an interfacial atom-mediated spin transfer pathway in heterostructures in which the photoexcited spin of Fe first transfers to intralayered Te atoms and then hops to interlayered NM layers. Interlayer hopping is approximately two times slower than intralayer spin transfer. Our results provide the microscopic understanding for optically control interlayer spin dynamics in 2D magnetic heterostructures.

Metastable omega '-Fe3C carbide formed during.-Fe3C particle coarsening in binary Fe-C alloys	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							OMEGA-PHASE; MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; CARBON; TRANSFORMATION; STEEL; CEMENTITE	Nanosized (similar to 2 nm) omega-Fe3C particles with hexagonal structures have been observed only at body-centered cubic (BCC) {112}< 111 >-type twinning boundaries in twinned Fe-C martensite of the Fe-C alloy system. However, these ultrafine.-Fe3C particles never grow large enough to be observed easily. The present structural modeling and electron diffraction calculations reveal that the formation of the new carbide (omega'-Fe3C) during coarsening of the ultrafine omega-Fe3C particles is inevitable. Coarsening or aggregation of fine omega-Fe3C particles may result in a phase transition due to the arrangement of interstitial carbon atoms. A omega-Fe3C -> omega'-Fe3C transition was analyzed at the atomic scale. The omega'-Fe3C phase can exhibit an orthorhombic structure with lattice parameters a(omega') = 4.033 angstrom, b(omega') = 2.470 angstrom, and c(omega') = 6.986 angstrom based on a(omega') = a(omega), b(omega') = c(omega'), and c(omega') = root 3 a(omega) for a(bcc) or a(a-Fe) = 2.852 angstrom (a(omega) = root 2 a(bcc), c(omega) = root 3/2 a(bcc)). The simulated omega'-Fe3C electron diffraction patterns were experimentally confirmed. The omega-Fe3C -> omega'-Fe3C transition can explain why the omega-Fe3C phase never becomes larger than several nanometers in carbon steel. Published under license by AIP Publishing.	[Ping, D.

Herein, a facile carbonizing strategy was adopted for fabricating leaf-like CoSNC nanocomposites, which possess both the sheet structure and multi-composites of well-dispersed CoS2 nanoparticles in N-doped carbon frameworks. First, the leaf-like nanocomposites with high aspect ratios effectively shortened the ion/electron transmission paths and exposed more faradaic redox sites. Second, the N-doped carbon frameworks could stabilize the electrode structure during charge/discharge processes. Third, the well-dispersed CoS2 nanoparticles could also enhance the electrochemical kinetics. Hence, leaf-like CoSNC nanocomposites as electrode materials exhibited high specific capacitance, good rate capacity and cycling stability.

The interaction between the atom X and the C-60 cage was calculated with a (exp-6-1) potential function. The potential parameters of the atom pair X-C present a systematical variation pattern with the radius, the ionization potential and the polarizability of X. The total energy variation Delta E(tot) from (X+C-60) to (X@C-60) can be referred to as the sum of Delta E(X) from X(free) to X(in(X@C-60)) and Delta E(C60) from C-60 (free) to C-60(in(X@C-60)) plus the interaction energy E(inter) between X(in(X@C-60)) and C-60(inX@C-60)) The results of calculations show that, except for (I@C-60), the electrostatic interaction energy E(es) plays a decisive role occupying about 90% whereas the dispersive attraction energy E(dis) and the repulsion energy E(rep) OCCUPY about 5% respectively. For the stability of (X@C-60) S=-Delta E(tot), there is a variation order: S-Li < S-Na < S-K < S-Rb < S-Cs and S-F > S-Cl > S-Br > S-I. Delta E(C60) can be separated into two parts, one from Delta E(G) due to the geometry variation and the other from Delta E(CT) due to the charge transfer. For both systems, Delta E(G) has a uniform order of variation: (Delta E(G))(I) > (Delta E(G))(Br) > (Delta E(G))(Cl) > (Delta E(G))(F) > (Delta E(G))(Li) > (Delta E(G))(Na) > (Delta E(G))(K) >(Delta E(G))(Rb) > (Delta E(G))(Cs).

Ultra-small angular FePt nanocrystals rich in vertexes/terraces/steps and with Pt contents gradually increasing from the inner to the outer part can be synthesized at certain Fe/Pt atomic ratios (2/1 or 1.1/1), which can directly grow on carbon-black for enhanced nanocrystal-carbon interface interaction by introducing the in situ carbon-black mixing process. Composition and structure characterization suggests that FePt@(Fe1-xPtx)O-y(OH)(z)/C nanocomposites with FePt alloy cores and surface Pt-doping hydroxyl iron oxide shells are formed after annealing. After controlled dealloying of Fe in annealed nanocrystals with a Fe/Pt ratio of 2/1, the finally formed nanocatalysts exhibited excellent electrochemical catalytic performance using the methanol oxidation reaction as a model, preserving an activity of 1610 mA mg(-1) Pt-1 (12 times the commercial Pt/C catalysts, higher than the best result (7.9 times the commercial Pt/C catalysts) just published in Science (Science, 2016, 354, 1410-1414), enhanced durability and high tolerance to CO poisoning.

An optimized dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) based electrolyte using lithium nitrate (LiNO3) as the lithium salt has been first investigated for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. The charge over-potential of Li-O-2 batteries with LiNO3/DMSO electrolyte is 0.42 V lower than that of batteries with LiClO4/DMSO electrolyte. The Li-O-2 batteries with LiNO3/DMSO electrolyte also showed excellent high C-rate performance and good cycling stability.

When these T-m values are combined with the five published T-m values of related unsaturated PE, a unifying T-m diagram is generated for the first lime. Moreover, as the molecular mechanics simulated structures of these lipids are taken into consideration, this unifying T-m diagram provides insight into how variations in the number and position of the cis double bond in the lipid's sn-2 acyl chain can influence the phase transition behavior of the lipid bilayer.

Electrochemical properties comparison of the polypyrrole nanotube and polyaniline nanofiber applied in supercapacitor	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							CARBON NANOTUBE; MATERIALS SCIENCE; COMPOSITE FILMS; GRAPHENE; NANOCOMPOSITE; CAPACITANCE; ELECTRODES; PERFORMANCE; FABRICATION; POLYMER	To exploit the potential application of the conductive polymers in incorporating with carbon-based materials, polypyrrole (PPY) nanotube and polyaniline (PANI) nanofiber were synthesized and the electrochemical properties were compared. The morphology, texture and chemical structure of PPY and PANI were tested employing SEM, TEM, FTIR and XPS. The results of electrochemical tests demonstrate that the specific capacitance of PPY nanotube is as high as 463 F/g at a current density of 0.3 A/g, much higher than that of PANI nanofiber (243 F/g). Furthermore, at a current density of 0.8 A/g, the capacitance of PPY nanotube is 172 F/g, higher than that of PANI nanofiber (104 F/g). Additionally, after the long-term charge-discharge test at a current density of 1.5 A/g, the preserved capacitance of PPY nanotube is still higher than that of PANI nanofiber (106.5 F/g vs. 75 F/g). The EIS measurement illustrates that the PPY nanotube shows lower contact interface resistance and shorter ion diffusion path than the PANI nanofiber. It suggests that the PPY nanotube is a promising material to be applied in supercapacitor rather than the PANI nanofiber, because of its extended internal cavity surface area and pore volume.

Based on the morphology changes in the acid etching test, a structural model of the siliconized fiber was proposed.

Therefore, the design and fabrication of integrated electrodes with binder-free and even current collectorfree are highly significant. Herein, we fabricated flexible Sb/Sb2O3-C nanofibers (NFs) films utilizing a facile combination of electrospinning technique and carbonization. Sb/Sb2O3 nanoparticles are well embedded in carbon NFs with a fiber diameter of ca. 340 nm. The fabricated NFs films can be directly used as binder and current collector-free anodes for SIBs and exhibited high-capacity and long-lifetime cycles (385.6 mAh g-1 over 500 cycles). Ex situ SEM and TEM observations re-appear their intact fibrous network morphology and stable one-dimensional composite structures after hundreds of discharging-charging cycles, demonstrating that Sb/Sb2O3-C NFs film is a promising binder-free electrode for SIBs.

Nevertheless, their practical applications are harshly inhibited by some drawbacks, such as shuttle effects resulting from dissolved polysulfides and polyselenides, chalcogen volume expansion, and dendrite growth on metal anodes. Functional components, such as chalcogen host, binder, and interlayer, using various polar materials have been introduced to address these issues. Among them, bio-derived materials are regarded as novel eco-friendly alternatives. In this report, the authors focus on the unique physical/chemical/environmental properties of bio-derived materials used in ACBs, including active host materials, polymer binders, separators, and additives. The authors hope that the present report can provide some new insights and directions for future research on high-performance ACBs.

Minimum values occurred in the evening and maximum values in the morning. Air pCO(2) in each of the three study areas showed small diurnal variations, while large diurnal variations were observed in seawater pCO(2). The diurnal variation amplitude of seawater pCO(2) was similar to 70 mu mol mol(-1) at the Yongshu Reef lagoon, 420-619 mu mol mol(-1) on the Yongxing Island reef flat, and 264-579 mu mol mol(-1) on the reef flat of the Luhuitou Fringing Reef, and 324-492 mu mol mol(-1) in an adjacent area just outside of this fringing reef. With respect to spatial relations, there were large differences in air-sea CO2 flux across the South China Sea (e.g. similar to 0.4 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at Yongshu Reef, similar to 4.7 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at Yongxing Island, and similar to 9.8 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) at Luhuitou Fringing Reef). However, these positive values suggest that coral reef ecosystems of the SCS may be a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Additional analyses indicated that diurnal variations of surface seawater pCO(2) in the shallow water reef flat are controlled mainly by biological metabolic processes, while those of deeper water lagoons and outer reef areas are regulated by both biological metabolism and hydrodynamic factors. Unlike the open ocean, inorganic metabolism plays a significant role in influencing seawater pCO(2) variations in coral reef ecosystems.

Barnacle fouling impedes the gaseous exchange and food production of the mangroves Kandelia obovata, a dominant mangrove species in Hong Kong and Taiwan	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Barnacles; Mangrove; Chlorophyll concentration; Stomata density	GROWTH	Barnacle fouling has shown to impede gas exchange ability of mangroves. Fouled mangrove plants may therefore obtain less carbon dioxide and water for photosynthesis, resulting in reduced food and chloroplasts production, but such hypothesis remains untested. The objective of the present study compared the stomata density (essential for obtaining carbon dioxide and water molecules) and leaf chlorophyll concentration (essential for photosynthesis) of fouled and non-fouled (control) of seedlings, juveniles and adults of the mangroves Kandelia obovata, in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The seedlings and juveniles of the dominant mangrove plant species, Kandelia obovata, in Hong Kong and Taiwan had a higher density of stomata but a lower chlorophyll concentration in the leaves, when the trunks and twigs were fouled by the barnacle Fistulobalanus albicostatus. Fouled K. obovata appears to develop more stomata in the leaves to compensate the blocking effect of the lenticel from barnacle fouling. As fouling impacts the gaseous exchange ability of mangroves, fouled plants could obtain less carbon dioxide and water for photosynthesis, resulting in reduced food and chloroplasts production. Fouled adult plants, however, had variable responses in leaf chlorophyll concentrations among the study sites, suggesting adults were more tolerant of barnacle fouling. The present study reveals seedling and juvenile mangrove plants are very susceptible to barnacle fouling, which impedes the gaseous exchange mechanism and food production, which can subsequently result in reduced growth, fitness and survival.

Here we extend the synthesis method of mesoporous silica nanospheres to enable the preparation of ordered mesoporous resorcinol formaldehyde nanospheres with particle size from 80 to 400 nm and mesopores of similar to 3.5 nm in diameter. By finely tuning the synthesis parameters, multi-layered mesoporous resorcinol formaldehyde hollow nanospheres can be successfully synthesized. Mesoporous carbon nanospheres and hollow nanospheres with high surface area are further obtained through carbonization of the polymer spheres. The resulting mesoporous carbon nanospheres are demonstrated as the host cathode material for lithium-sulphur batteries. The synthesis strategy provides a benchmark for fabricating well-defined porous carbonaceous nanospheres with potential for energy storage and conversion applications.

The tribological properties of friction materials are carried out by a ring-on-block tribo-tester sliding against AISI 51200 steel ring under different braking loads and speeds. The friction coefficient and wear rate increase with the increase of load and speed. The synergistic effect of aramid pulp fibre and carbon fibre improves the tribological properties of friction materials. However, the friction coefficient and wear rate increase as the glass fibre increases. The specimen with 9%/1%/7% of aramid pulp/glass/carbon fibres shows more reasonable friction coefficient (0.31-0.50) and lower wear rate (4.5-7.9 x 10(-6) mm(3) N-1 m(-1)) than that of commercial friction material.

By removing excess salts in the culture medium and optimizing pulse conditions, diatom cells can be transformed with high transformation efficiency. This method is also applicable to other marine diatoms, such as the centric diatom Chaetoceros gracilis. This efficient and stable transformation system will be useful for both functional analysis of diatom-specific genes and for further biotechnological applications.

J	Hao, YL; Li, S; Xia, Q				Hao, Yun-li; Li, Shuang; Xia, Qing			Strategic Research on the Urban Natural Gas Energy System Under the Path to Ecological Civilization: Fuyang City Case Study	FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						natural gas; differential equation; natural gas energy intensity; natural gas ecological civilization intensity; economic ecological civilization intensity	CARBON EMISSIONS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CHINA; EVOLUTION; IMPACT; REDUCTION; RESOURCE; CONSUMPTION; INTENSITY; PRICES	To help meet the strategic development needs of urban energy systems today and reduce carbon emissions, natural gas can play a pivotal transition role, especially in a country such as China, which has relied very heavily on coal for decades. Though making significant progress toward the maximum possible use of clean, renewable forms of energy, such as hydro, thermal, solar, and wind power, it will take a long time before China can completely abandon the use of fossil fuels. In this paper, using Fuyang City in Anhui Province as a case study, a four-dimensional differential equation model, based on the consumption, price, economic growth, and "ecological civilization construction" of natural gas energy, is developed, which incorporates concepts and calculations of natural gas energy intensity, "natural gas ecological civilization intensity," and "economic ecological civilization intensity." It is the first attempt ever made to quantify the construction of urban ecological civilization and discuss the evolutionary relationship among the internal variables of the system. Regression analysis, data fitting, neural network, and other methods are used to confirm the parameters of the system model. Through Matlab simulation of each variable and using an evolution map, a quantitative understanding of the role of natural gas is generated. The research findings reveal that paying attention to the environmental aspects of energy consumption is beneficial to economic growth. The paper concludes that, at present, the best ways for China to reduce its carbon emissions are to implement a market price and peak-valley prices for natural gas, improve the tiered price mechanism, appropriately reduce the economic growth rate, continue to adjust the industrial structure away from heavy industry, and scientifically manage the natural gas energy system. These reforms are of great practical significance in working toward a sustainable development path for the city.

CH4 conversion decreased and CO selectivity remained essentially constant with increasing of carbon space velocity. In 1098-1158 K, the CH4 conversion was larger than 96% with the CO selectivity larger than 97% at low carbon space velocity. The simulated results showed good agreement with the experimental data. The model simulated the effects of air flow rate and membrane reactor length on the performance of membrane reaction, which suggested optimal operating conditions for the syngas production in the membrane reactor.

In this work, we investigated CO2 capture on different metal embedded graphynes (M-GYs) under different charge states via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that the neutral Ti, V, Cr and Mn embedded GYs could effectively capture CO2 molecules, and the adsorption energy of CO2 was dramatically enhanced on negatively charged M-GYs. The process of CO2 capture/release on Fe or Co embedded GY occurs spontaneously once extra electrons are introduced/removed. Therefore, Fe- and Co-GYs are promising materials for reversible efficient CO2 storage. Ti-GY has the largest CO2 adsorption capacity. By comparing the adsorption of CO2 by non-noble metals and noble metals, it is found that non-noble metals are more conducive to large-scale practical application for CO2 capture due to their high sensitivity to CO2 and low cost. This investigation provides valuable information for designing reusable CO2 storage materials.

Herein, core shell magnetic mesoporous materials with cauliflower-like morphology and tunable surface roughness have been synthesized through a,kinetics-controlled interface co-assembly and deposition of mesostructured nanocomposites on Fe304@RF microspheres (RF refers to resorcinol formaldehyde resin). The obtained microspheres, synthesized via this interface nanoengineering method, possess well-defined sandwich structure with a tunable rough morphology, uniform size (560-1000 nm), perpendiculady aligned mesopores nm) in the outer shell, RF-protected magnetic responsive core, high surface area up to 382 m(2)/g, and large pore volume of 0.66 cm(3)/g. As a result of the unique surface features and magnetic properties, these microspheres exhibit excellent performance in stabilizing and oxygen-free manipulating aqueous solutions in petroleum ether by a magnetic field. They also exhibit superior cell uptake properties compared with traditional smooth core shell magnetic mesoporous silica microspheres, opening up the possible applications in fast drug delivery in cancer therapy.

However, short cyclability due to zinc dendrite growth remains a major obstacle. Here, we report a cross-linked polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based cation exchange membrane that is low cost and mechanically robust. Li2S3 reacts with PAN, simultaneously leading to cross-linking and formation of sulfur-containing functional groups. Hydrolysis of the membrane results in the formation of a membrane that achieves preferred cation transport and homogeneous ionic flux distribution. The separator is thin (30 mu m-thick), almost 9 times stronger than hydrated Nafion, and made of low-cost materials. The membrane separator enables exceptionally long cyclability (>350 cycles) of Zn/Zn symmetric cells with low polarization and effective dendrite suppression. Our work demonstrates that the design of new separators is a fruitful pathway to enhancing the cyclability of aqueous batteries.

However, the poor corrosion resistance limits their further clinical applications. In this study, the combined strategies of surface chemical treatment and layer-by-layer self-assembly were used to prepare composite coatings on Mg alloys to improve the biocorrosion resistance. Specially, alkalized AZ91 Mg alloy generated chemical linkage with silane via Si-O-Mg covalent bond at the interface. Subsequently, Si-OH group from silane formed a crosslinked silane layer by Si-O-Si network. Further chemical assembly with graphene oxide (GO), lengthened the diffusion pathway of corrosive medium. The chemically assembled composite coatings could firmly bond to Mg alloy substrate, which persistently and effectively acted as compact barriers against corrosion propagation. Improved biocorrosion resistance of AZ91 Mg alloy with self-assembly composite coatings of silane/GO was subsequently confirmed by immersion tests. Besides, the Mg alloy exhibited good wear resistance due to outside layer of GO with a lubricant effect. Cell viability of higher than 75% had also been found for the alloy with self-assembly composite coatings, which showed good cytocompatibility.

This paper combines observation data, emission reduction measures, and air quality simulations that were applied before, during, and after the emission control measure implement to analyze the chemical composition change and relationship between emissions and concentrations of pollutants in region. The 24-h PM2.5 samples were collected in the city Beijing, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan during the period of 20 October to 25 November, 2014. The total PM2.5 mass was measured. PM2.5 samples were used for the analysis of inorganic elements, selected ions, and organic carbon (OC) and element carbon (EC). PM2.5 concentrations during the emission control period were decreased. Total PM2.5 concentrations were reduced by 54, 26, and 39 % when compared to non-emission control period in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan. The average element concentrations were reduced significantly by 75 % in Beijing, 37 % in Shijiazhuang, and 36 % in Tangshan. After the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference, the average element concentration increased. At both cities, the concentration secondary water-soluble ions, primary carbon, and element carbon were reduced. However, the concentration of secondary carbon species increased in Beijing due to photochemical oxidants change. More stringent control of regional emissions will be needed for significant reductions of fine particulate pollution in the region to continue to improve air quality.

Preparation, characterization, and reactivity of (3-methylpentadienyl)iron(1+) cations	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; ASYMMETRIC INDUCTION; (PENTADIENYL)IRON(1+) CATIONS; NUCLEOPHILIC-ADDITION; DIENE-MOLYBDENUM; COMPLEXES; IRON; REGIOSELECTIVITY; CYCLOHEXENONES; DITERPENES	The title cations (9 and 12) were prepared by dehydration of (3-methyl-2,4-pentadien-l-ol)Fe(CO)(2)L+ complexes. The structure of the (CO)(2)PPh3-ligated 12 was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Reaction of carbon and heteroatom nucleophiles to (3-methylpentadienyl)Fe(CO)(3)(+) cations 9 and 12 proceeds either via attack at the dienyl terminus to give (3-methyl-1, 3 Z-diene) iron complexes or via attack at the internal carbon, followed by carbon monoxide insertion and reductive elimination to afford 3-methyl-4-substituted cyclohexenones. Cyclohexenone formation was found to be prevalent for addition of stabilized nucleophiles with strongly dissociated counterions to cation 9 (L = CO). Reaction of cation 9 with sodium bis[(-)-8-phenylmenthyl] malonate gave a single diastereomeric cyclohexenone.

This study developed a hybrid nanocomposite (Pb-BFO/rGO) using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, which grafted Pb-doped BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets. Pb-BFO/rGO was used as a heterogeneous catalyst in a microwave enhanced Fenton-like process (MW-Fenton-like) for the decomposition of perfluoroocatanoic acid (PFOA), a perfluorinated compound present in water bodies with high bioaccumulation and toxicity for human being. The results reveal that Pb-BFO/rGO has large specific surface area (similar to 84.2 m(2) g (1)), small crystallite sizes (similar to 3.3 nm) and multiple functional groups such as carboxyl groups and Fe-O groups. Compared with the bare BFO and Pb-BFO, Pb-BFO/rGO showed greater catalytic efficiencies for H2O2 activation for PFOA degradation with the removal ratio of 90.0% from 30.0 mg L (1) to 50.0 mg L (1) within 5.0 min in the MW-Fenton-like process. Microwave irradiation was shown to significantly influence the degradation of PFOA through energy transfer and cross-coupling reactions. Pb-BFO/rGO absorbed the microwave energy, which facilitated the decomposition of H2O2 and the generation of hydroxy radicals (center dot OH), which is responsible for the PFOA degradation. The degradation pathway of PFOA was investigated by detecting the degradation byproducts using UPLC-MS/MS and ICP/MS. Five kinds of short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids and fluoride ion were identified. The overall findings provide new insight into the novel hybrid catalysis for Fenton-like and other water treatment applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Injected CO2, however, can potentially leak into water systems, increase water acidity, and mobilize metals. This study used column experiments to quantify the effects of environmental controls on cadmium desorption during CO2 leakage in subsurface systems without ambient flow. Results show that fast leakage rates are responsible for earlier and larger amounts of Cd desorption. Long weathering time of Cd laden clay leads to low Cd desorption. Calcite content as low as 10% can mitigate the effect of pH reduction and result in zero Cd desorption. Increasing the salinity of the leaking fluid has a relatively minor effect, primarily due to the offsetting impacts of an increased extent of ion exchange and the decrease in CO2 solubility (and therefore acidity). This work systematically quantifies, for the first time, the effects of environmental controls on Cd desorption and points to key parameters for risk assessment associated with metal mobilization during CO2 leakage.

Facile electrospinning was used to prepare SnO2 nanofibers coated with a protective carbon layer. The mechanical properties of individual core-shell-structured SnO2@C nanofibers were investigated by atomic force microscopy and the finite element method. The elastic moduli of the carbon-coated SnO2 nanofibers remarkably increased, suggesting that coating SnO2 nanofibers with carbon could be an effective method of improving their mechanical properties.

The huge volume expansion and significant capacity fading of Si electrode are the biggest problems hindering its actual use. In this paper, an intricate hollow Si nanocomposite is designed involving two carbon layers, one void space, and one SiO2 layer as an electrode material to resolve the two issues mentioned above. The two carbon layers can increase the electric conductivity of the electrode. Besides, the void space and SiO2 layer in the Si/C/void/SiO2/C composite can provide multiple guarantees for the preservation of whole structure of the electrode. As a result, this novel structure can deliver a capacity of 900 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Yang, L. Y.; Wang, S.

SiBCN ceramic-based metamaterials modified with defect-rich carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were developed by combining the additive manufacturing technique and polymer derived ceramic route. Meta-structures were patterned by additive manufacturing of preceramic polymer and followed by thermolysis of the green bodies. Defect-rich CNFs were in-situ generated by thermolysis of nanocellulose introduced into the preceramic green bodies. When the content of cellulose is 6.0 wt % and the annealing temperature is 1200 degrees C, the real and imaginary part of permittivity can reach as high as 17.0 and 7.0, respectively. Cole-Cole circle plots indicates that the CNFs-SiBCN ceramics possess strong polarization capability due to the defect-rich structure of CNFs. At the thickness of 1.8 mm, the minimal reflection loss (RLmin) can reach -20.0 dB while the effective absorption bandwidth reached 2.85 GHz. Through multi-scale (nano and macro) designing, a simulated ultra-broad effective absorption bandwidth of 32.4 GHz from 7.6 GHz to 40 GHz was achieved, where the RLmin reached -46.0 dB at the frequency of 26.8 GHz. This work finds innovative route for the development of ceramic-based broadband electromagnetic absorption materials and new application for the polymer derived ceramics.

Bacillus subtilis 168 was genetically modified to produce surfactin by increasing the supply of the precursor fatty acyl-CoA by overexpressing 4 ' phosphopantetheinyl transferase, medium-chain acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase and fatty acyl CoA ligase (encoded by sfp, bte, and yhfL, respectively), and knocking out acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (encoded by fadE). The resulting recombinant strain BSFX022 produced 2203 mg/L surfactin with xylose as carbon source. The lower accumulation of organic acids with xylose as carbon source made it possible to maintain surfactin production in a non-buffered fermentation system, and the yield reached 2074 mg/L. Furthermore, to reduce the costs, waste biomass such as corncob hydrolysate and monosodium glutamate wastewater (MGW) were used, and 2032 mg/L of surfactin was produced in the optimal waste-based medium. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of surfactin production using genetically modified Bacillus subtilis 168 with xylose as carbon source.

After liver injury, HSCs undergo transdifferentiation process from quiescent state to activated state, which plays an important role in liver fibrosis. Previous studies have shown that thymoquinone (TQ) might have protective effect against liver fibrosis in animal models; however, the underlying mechanism of action is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to examine whether TQ has any direct effect on HSCs. Our results showed that pretreatment of mice with TQ has protective effect against CCl4-induced liver injury compared to control group (untreated), which is consistent with previous studies. Moreover, our in vivo study showed that COL1A1 and alpha-SMA mRNA levels were significantly downregulated by TQ treatment. Similarly, in vitro study confirmed that TQ downregulated COL1A1, COL3A1 and a-SMA mRNA levels in activated rat HSCs and LX2 cells, an immortalized human hepatic stellate cell line. Pretreatment with TQ also inhibited the LPS-induced proinflammatory response in LX2 cells as demonstrated by reduced mRNA expression of IL-6 and MCP-1. Mechanistically, inactivation of NF-kappa B pathway is likely to play a role in the TQ-mediated inhibition of proinflammatory response in HSCs. Finally, we have shown that TQ inhibited the culture-triggered transdifferentiation of freshly isolated rat HSCs as shown by significant downregulation of mRNA expression of several fibrosis-related genes. In conclusion, our study suggests that TQ has a direct effect on HSCs, which may contribute to its overall antifibrotic effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Towards the modelling and control of NOx emission in a fluidized bed sludge combustor	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Sludge; Incineration; NOx formation; Modelling; Control	DRIED SEWAGE-SLUDGE; COAL COMBUSTION; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; ENERGY-PRODUCTION; DEM-LES; BIOMASS; CHAR; PARTICLE; NH3; SIMULATION	Sludge incineration is a widely used technology because of its large volume reduction and complete organic destruction. However, incineration does encounter a number of drawbacks, among which are notably carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Carbon monoxide emissions are efficiently avoided by oxygen regulation in the furnace. Nitrogen oxide (NOx) formation, however, is very complex and not well known. This paper proposes a dynamic model of sludge combustion in an industrial fluidized bed combustor mainly focused on NOx formation. The model is tuned with industrial data. A control strategy is proposed to improve on the current industrial regulation, simultaneously ensuring CO and NOx control, yet without decreasing the combustion efficiency. The results are sufficiently acceptable for this process to be carried out in a real incinerator plant. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The microstructure is formed through a simple one-step process involving self-assembly. The fabricated composite exhibits superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity as well as low density, owing to which it floats on water and can be used for the in-situ separation of oil from water at the oil/water interface. Furthermore, the composite exhibits pH responsivity, and its water permeability can be varied simply by altering the pH of the aqueous solution. In addition, the composite is suitable for use as an electrode material for supercapacitors owing to its large geometric surface area, porous structure, and superior electrical properties, which allow for fast ion and electron transportation. Thus, this composite consisting of forests of vertically aligned carbonaceous microcones on a nickel mesh is expected to find use in a wide range of fields and applications, including in environmental cleanup, flow switches, and energy storage devices.

The calculated binding energies of key formic acid decomposition intermediates including formate (HCOO), carboxyl (COOH), carbon monoxide (CO), water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydroxyl (OH), carbon (C), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H; H-2) are presented. Using these energetics, we develop thermochemical potential energy diagrams for both the carboxyl-mediated and the formate-mediated dehydrogenation mechanisms on each surface. We evaluate the relative stability of COOH, HCOO, and other isomeric intermediates (i.e., CO + OH, CO2 + H, CO + O + H) on these surfaces. These results provide insights into formic acid decomposition selectivity (dehydrogenation versus dehydration), and in conjunction with calculated vibrational frequency modes, the results can assist with the experimental search for the elusive carboxyl (COOH) surface intermediate. Results are compared against experimental reports in the literature.

In this work, spindle-shaped Ce-TCPPs were assembled by a rapid microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. After thermal treatment at low temperature under a N-2 atmosphere, the Ce-TCPPs were partially pyrolyzed and converted to a novel CeO2/N-doped carbon/Ce-TCPP nano-composite. Compared to completely decomposed materials, these partially decomposed heterogeneous catalysts exhibited significantly higher photocatalytic activation ability toward PMS for the removal of organic pollutants (e.g., rhodamine B, methylene blue, methyl orange, tetracycline and oxytetracycline). For the optimized sample thermal treated at 450 degrees C, a 100 mL RhB solution (10 mg/L) can be removed within 20 min with the assistance of PMS under visible light. The significantly enhanced activity can be attributed to the effective spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes in the formed Z-scheme CeO2/N-doped carbon/Ce-TCPP system. This work may provide useful guidance for the design and fabrication of MOF-derived photocatalytic systems for environmental remediation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, a series of Ni-Mg-Al catalysts with different Mg/Al molar ratios has been synthesized by a co-precipitation method for hydrogen production by SCWG of glucose. Effects of Mg addition on the catalytic activity, hydrothermal stability and anti-carbon performance of alumina supported nickel catalyst were investigated. The highly dispersed nickel catalysts prepared by co-precipitation could greatly enhance the gasification efficiency of glucose in supercritical water. Among the tested Ni-Mg-Al catalysts, NiMg0.6Al1.9 showed the highest catalytic activity with the hydrogen yield of 11.77 mmol/g (912% as that of non-catalytic test). NiMg0.6Al1.9 also showed the best hydrothermal stability probably due to the formation of MgAl2O4. Mg could efficiently improve the anti-carbon ability of Ni-Al catalyst by inhibiting the formation of graphite carbon. It is also confirmed that MgO supported nickel catalyst is not suitable for SCWG process owing to the difficulty on nickel oxides reduction in the precursors and the phase change of MgO to Mg(OH)(2) under the hydrothermal condition.

The shuttle mechanism decreases the capacity delivered by the battery, hampers its rechargeability, and promotes battery self discharge. We have developed a simple model of the shuttle mechanism that reproduces quantitatively the rate of the initial self discharge of lithium-sulphur batteries. The rate of sulphur and polysuiphide diffusion has been quantified by studying cells with varying number of separators between the electrodes. We have found that it is essential that the model incorporates the presence of carbon additive in the sulphur electrode, which slows down the decrease of the open circuit potential with time. The model also reproduces well the rate of self-discharge of lithium-sulphur cells containing sulphur dissolved in the electrolyte. In conclusion, the present model provides a basic understanding of the mechanism of self-discharge of lithium-sulphur cells, and allows quantifying the two main causes of sulphur loss at the sulphur electrode: sulphur diffusion across a concentration gradient and sulphur reaction with poly sulphides formed at the lithium electrode.

After the longitudinal reinforcements were corroded to the expected ratio by the electrochemically accelerated method, the corrosion-damaged concrete cover was removed, and then repaired with FRP grid-reinforced ECC matrix (FGREM) composites. The investigated test variables were mainly FRP grid types (carbon and basalt), strengthening amounts, corrosion level, and longitudinal reinforcement ratio. The experimental results indicated that the bearing capacities of the corroded beams were sufficiently improved using this strengthening technique. The intermediate debonding at the concrete substrate-to-ECC interface caused by flexural cracks could be completely suppressed. The use of a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) grid with higher stiffness could produce a weaker ductile behavior and prematurely trigger critical diagonal crack-induced debonding. Furthermore, the flexural bearing capacities of the basalt-FGREM strengthened beams could be reasonably predicted according to the ACI-549.4R-13 provisions. However, the predicted results were relatively dangerous for carbon-FGREM strengthened beams, which failed under the control of the critical diagonal crack-induced debonding mode.

The interfacial and interpenetrating phase compositions of 3D-SiC/Al were examined using scanning electron microscopy, an energy dispersive spectrometer, and X-ray diffraction. The results showed that carbon fiber can improve the infiltration effect, with SiO2 layers of differing thickness affecting the infiltration process to different degrees. The final sample exhibited good mechanical properties with a bending strength of 330.3 MPa.

Effect of pressure-free heating curing time on bending property of 2D T700/E44 composites prepared by ICM	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS			English	Article						improved compression molding process; T700/E44 composite; curing time; infiltration; bending properties	REINFORCED EPOXY COMPOSITES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FIBER; TEMPERATURE; CARBON; GLASS	Six kinds of 2D T700/E44 composites with pressure-free curing times of 40 min, 60 min, 80 min, 100 min, 120 min and 140 min are prepared by improved compression molding process (ICM). The macroscopic morphology of the composites is satisfactory. The microstructure observation and bending performance tests show that composites have poor infiltration effect. When the pressure-free curing time is less than 80 min, defects are easy to occur such as insufficient infiltration and voids. Bad infiltration and void defects will lead to poor continuity of carbon fiber and resin, and their bending fracture will also be unreasonable, so the bending strength of composite at 40 min is 275 MPa. The infiltration effect is gradually improved with the increase of pressure-free heating curing time. However, when the pressure-free heating curing time reaches 120 min or more, the infiltration effect of the composites is deteriorated, and this is due to excessive infiltration time and extrusion force in subsequent heating extrusion infiltration process. Defects such as fiber aggregation and uneven infiltration are prone to occur, and bending strength of composites reduces to 380 MPa. When the pressure-free curing time is 100 min, the infiltration effect of the prepared composite is satisfactory, and the imbalanced infiltration and hole defects are effectively eliminated. The bending fracture of composite material is uneven, carbon fibers and resin play the roles of reinforcement and transferring loads effectively respectively, so the bending strength of the prepared 2D T700/E44 composite reaches 730 MPa.

How to make practical use of ocean energy to produce sustainable energy still poses challenges. In this work, a half-wave rectifying water flow-driven triboelectric nanogenerator (HRWF-TENG) is fabricated to collect water wave energy towards hydrogen production via self-powered electrochemical water splitting. The HRWFTENG achieves large voltage and low loss direct current (DC) output using a half-wave rectifying circuit, which enables the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current to reach 100 V and 90 mu A at 140 rpm, respectively. The RuOx/CNT catalyst was prepared for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the HRWF-TENG provided electrons for water molecules to generate hydrogen at the cathode. By connecting the HRWF-TENG with a water splitting unit directly, the whole system can a hydrogen production rate of 12.32 mu L min-1, with a sustainable hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 2.38%. The entire design simplifies the traditional self-powered water splitting system by a half-wave rectifying TENG, providing a more practical strategy for conversion of ocean energy into renewable hydrogen energy.

However, the conventional Ni/YSZ and some other fuel electrodes suffer some technological limitations such as the use of protecting gas CO/H-2. Here we demonstrate the efficient electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide without flowing any protecting gases based on the porous cathode with La0.3Sr0.7Ti0.3Fe0.7O3-delta(LSTF) nanostructured composite which is infiltrated into a scandia-stabilized zirconia scaffold together with ceria. The infiltrated porous electrode provides excellent performance for CO2 electrolysis. By I-V measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic characterization, it shows that the current densities during electrolysis below a cell voltage of 2 V is between 1.20 and 4.44 A cm(-2), increasing with temperature increase over the temperature range of 700-850 degrees C, and the cell with configuration of LSTF/CeO2 vertical bar ScSZ vertical bar LSM/ScSZ possesses low electrode polarization resistances (R-p) within different voltage ranges, for example, R-p = 0.18 Omega cm(2) at an applied voltage of 2.0 V, which is one order of magnitude lower than other reported electrode materials such as La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+delta. Moreover, a combination of short-term stability test for 48 h and cyclic stability test of LSTF/CeO2 are also estimated, and the results show that the nanostructured LSTF/CeO2 is highly effective for CO2 electrolysis.

We explored the influence of reaction temperature, reaction space velocity, and the feed ratio of methanol to air on the catalytic effect of the process based on the Fe-Mo-based bifunction catalyst and discovered the most appropriate reaction conditions for the process. Results showed that excessively high reaction temperatures were not conducive to the formation of target product Dimethoxymethane (DMM) and this was verified from the perspective of thermodynamic analysis. At the same time, through Brunaure Emmett Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, NH3-temperature-programmed chemisorption, and Pyridine Fourier Infrared (PY-FTIR) characterization, analysis of the microstructure and surface characteristics of the catalyst showed that an excessively high reaction temperature caused accumulation of metal oxides on the catalyst surface to block pores and reduce the specific surface area. This also destroyed the active acidic sites on the catalyst surface and weakened the acidity of the catalyst, thereby reducing catalytic activity. Investigation showed that excessively high reaction space velocity caused most of the formaldehyde obtained by catalyzing the initial oxidative dehydrogenation to fail to undergo polycondensation with methanol after desorption in time to obtain DMM, leading to a significant decrease in DMM selectivity. Investigation of the methanol-air feed ratio showed that when CH3OH:air = 1.5, the methylal selectivity was highest and catalytic activity had improved. Orthogonal experiments showed that optimal reaction conditions of the process were 663 K, 15 000 h(-1) and CH3OH: air = 0.82. In addition, compared with other bifunctional catalysts of this process, the self-made Mo:Fe(2)/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst exhibited high stability and carbon deposition resistance under severe operating conditions.

In this study, seven different bitumous coals were burned in a full-scale 100 MWe pulverized coal combustion boiler and the derived fly ash samples were collected from a mechanical hopper (MH) and an electrostatic precipitator hopper (ESP). The mercury content, specific surface area (SSA), unburned carbon, and elemental composition of the fly ash samples were analyzed to evaluate the correlation between the concentration of particulate-bound mercury and the properties of coal and fly ash. For a given coal, it was found that the mercury content in the fly ash collected from the ESP was greater than in the fly ash samples collected from the MHP. This phenomenon may be due to a lower temperature of flue gas at the ESP (similar to 135 degrees C) compared to the temperature at the air preheater (similar to 350 degrees C). Also, a significantly lower SSA observed in MH ash might also contribute to the observation. A comparison of the fly ash samples generated from seven different coals using statistical methods indicates that the mercury adsorbed on ESP fly ashes has a highly positive correlation with the unburned carbon content, manganese content, and SSA of the fly ash. Sulfur content in coal showed a significant negative correlation with the Hg adsorption. Manganese in fly ash is believed to participate in oxidizing volatile elemental mercury (Hg-0) to ionic mercury (Hg2+). The oxidized mercury in flue gas can form a complex with the fly ash and then get removed before the flue gas leaves the stack of the boiler.

However, the low utilization of the Li2S cathode and the lack of electrolytes compatible to both electrodes are impeding the development. Here, a novel graphite/Li2S battery system, which features a self-assembled, holey-Li2S nanoarchitecture and a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the graphite electrode, is reported. The holey structure on Li2S is beneficial in decomposing Li2S at the first charging process due to the enhanced Li ion extraction and transfer from the Li2S to the electrolyte. In addition, the concentrated dioxolane (DOL)-rich electrolyte designed lowers the irreversible capacity loss for SEI formation. By using the combined strategies, the graphite/holey-Li2S battery delivers an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 810 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (based on the mass of Li2S) and of 714 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C. Moreover, it exhibits a reversible capacity of 300 mAh g(-1) after a record lifecycle of 600 cycles at 1 C. These results suggest the great potential of the designed LFA/holey-Li2S batteries for practical use.

In CH2Cl2 at -78-degrees-C mixtures of the alkylidynetungsten compound and PPh3 on treatment with HBF4.Et2O afford the complex [W(CO)2{eta-4-C6H4(CH2)[CH(PPh3)]1,2}(eta-C5H5)][BF4]2, the structure of which has been established by X-ray crystallography. The C6H4-(CH2)[CH(PPh3)]-1,2 ligand is eta-4-co-ordinated to the tungsten via the carbon atoms of the ortho CH and CH2 substituents of the C6H4 group and their respective ring carbons [W-C 2.30(2) to 2.41(2) angstrom]. The terminal CH fragment carries a PPh3 group P-C [1.81(2) angstrom]. The tungsten atom is also ligated by the C5H5 ring and two CO groups in the usual manner. Treatment of [W(= CC6H4CH2OMe-2)(CO)2(eta-C5H5)] with aqueous Hl affords sequentially the alkylidene complex [W{= C(H)C6H4CH2OMe-2}-l(CO)2(eta-C5H5)] and the acyl compound [Wl2(CO)(eta-2-COCH2C6H4CH2OMe-2)(eta-C5H5)].

However, large production volumes and toxic nature of silver lead to potentially adverse effects on human health and environment, and the rapid consumption of Ag+ ion results in short-term efficacy. In this study, carbon-encapsulated Ag (Ag@C) was designed and used as an antibacterial agent in view of the superior antibacterial property of silver nanoparticles, and a tunable Ag+ ion release rate, which was achieved by varying the thickness of the carbon shell. Structural changes were systematically investigated by a series of experimental and theoretical studies. The results showed the evolution of Ag@C from Ag nanoparticles to triangular Ag nanoplates and finally to carbon-encapsulated hexagonal Ag nanoplates. The antibacterial and antifouling performances of Ag@C towards Escherichia coli/Staphylococcus aureus and Platymonas subcordiformis/Tropidoneis lepidoptera were investigated and the antibacterial mechanism was also discussed. The released Ag+ ion concentrations were controllable and sustainable at 39.4 and 0.667 ppb for Ag@C with carbon shell thicknesses of 31.5 and 247 nm, which attenuated the toxicity of the Ag nanoparticles. Ag@C showed stable antibacterial and antifouling properties and proved to be potentially suitable for biological and environmental applications.

Owing to the strong aromatic C=N bond and high chemical stability, only a few CTFs are crystalline, and most CTFs are amorphous. Herein we report a new general strategy to give highly crystalline CTFs by insitu formation of aldehyde monomers through the controlled oxidation of alcohols. This general strategy allows a series of crystalline CTFs with different monomers to be prepared, which are shown to have higher thermal stability and enhanced performance in photocatalysis as compared with the less crystalline or amorphous CTFs. This open-system approach is very simple and convenient, which presents a potential pathway to large-scale industrial production of crystalline CTFs.

However, preparing the transition metal selenide with elaborate nanostructures remains a challenge. Herein, a two-step hydrothermal method was utilized to design NiCo2Se4 electrode with hollow nanotubes. By controlling the feeding of selenium in the selenization process, the formation mechanism of NiCo2Se4 nanotubes was investigated. In detail, the characterization methods, such as FESEM, TEM, XRD, EDS, and Raman spectroscopy, were implemented to study the influence of selenium on the morphology, structure composition, and electrochemical performance of NiCo2Se4 electrode. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using the optimized NiCo2Se4 as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, showing high energy density of 25.0 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 490 W kg(-1) and excellent cycle stability (93% of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles). This study will shed light on the facile design of transition metal selenide electrode with high electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The current market players are in urgent need of implementing their own energy saving and emission reduction actions. Relatively extensive and systematic researches on the assessment of the energy saving and emission reduction effects for the power plants, power grid companies, and technical equipment have been carried out at home and abroad. However, there are still vacancies in the researches on those for electricity retailers emerged on the sales side. Based on the carding and analysis of related policies and guidance, in this paper, relevant indicators are considered to build the evaluation indicator system of the energy saving and emission reduction effects for electricity retailers. The combination weights are gained by means of analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method. Then, after the combined empowerment of indicators, the multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of energy saving and emission reduction effects for electricity retailers is conducted. Finally, choosing 10 electricity retailers (numbered from A to J) as evaluation objects, this model is used for obtaining the evaluation results and ranking of energy saving and emission reduction effects of electricity retailers, which provides reasonable ideas for the construction of evaluation indicator system and effective comprehensive evaluation methods of energy saving and emission reduction effects for market players in the electricity sales side. The results of example analysis show that, from a single dimension, the best electricity retailers in market transactions, technical means, integrated energy services, management system, and social responsibilities are followed by B, J, D, G, C, or I. However, from a global perspective, the sorted evaluation results are D, J, I, A, H, G, E, B, F, and C, which reflects the overall energy saving and emission reduction effects of electricity retailers through the two-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation.

Electrocatalysts, as the vital meditors, have been applied in Li-S systems with notable improvements, but scarcely explored for ions-storage battery. Herein, for introducting cation-tunable MOx ( M = Mn/Fe/Co/Ni) as electrocatalysts, various MoS2 @MOx are designed through chemical-precipitation and thermal-treatment manners. Benefitting from the high affinity of MoS2 and MOx, the interfacial chemical bonds Mo-S-M are established, boosting the improvement of ions/electrons transferring and structural integrality. Owing to the evolution of outer orbitals and ionic radius, the capturing and conversion of Li2S8 are tailored in order of Fe2O3 > MnO > CoO > NiO. Supported by unique 3d-orbital/ion-radiu and Mo-S-Fe bonds, the ultra-fast ability of MoS2 @Fe2O3 remains similar to 612 mAh g(-1) after 3,000 loops even at 5.0 A g(-1), meanwhile delivering similar to 800 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) in full-cell. Assisted by detailed kinetic behaviors and theoretical calculations, the redox reaction mechisms are clearly proposed, whilst the reduced Gibbs free energy (-1.25 of Fe2O3) serves crucial roles in the reaction (Li2S8 -> Li2S6). This work is expected to shed light on the in-depth understanding of fourth-periods MOx electrocatalysts, and offers more possibilities for designing advanced metal-sulfides electrodes. MoS2 nanosheets uniformly anchored with MOx ( M =Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) were rationally engineered, accompanied by the establishment of Mo-S-M interfacial chemical bonds. The electrocatalytic abilities of introduced MOx were successfully tailored by the evolution of cationic outer orbitals and ionic radius, inducing the fascinated catalytic conversion behaviors.

The plasmid, pDQTES, carrying an acyl-ACP thioesterase 'TesA of E. coli in pTrc99A was constructed firstly, and then (3R)-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase was ligated after the TesA to give the plasmid pDQTESZ. These two strains exhibited efficient fatty acid production when glucose was used as the sole carbon source, with a final concentration of 2.45 and 3.32 g/L, respectively. The free fatty acid production of the two strains on xylose is not as efficient as that on glucose, which was 2.32 and 2.96 g/L, respectively. For mixed sugars, DQ101 (MG1655 fadD(-))-based strains utilized glucose and pentose sequentially under the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) regulation. The highest total FFAs concentration from the mixed sugar culture reached 2.81 g/L by DQ101 (MG1655 fadD(-))/pDQTESZ. Furthermore, when ionic liquid-based enzyme-catalyzed bamboo hydrolysate was used as the carbon source, the strain DQ101 (MG1655 fadD(-))/pDQTESZ could produce 1.23 g/L FFAs with a yield of 0.13 g/g, and while it just produced 0.65 g/L free fatty acid with the ionic liquid-based acid-catalyzed bamboo hydrolysate as the feedstock. The results suggested that enzymatic catalyzed bamboo hydrolysate with ionic liquid pretreatment could serve as an efficient feedstock for free fatty acid production.

Phase constitution effect on the ductility of low alloy multiphase transformation induced plasticity steels	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING			English	Article						TRIP steels; Retained austenite; Ductility; Martensitic transformation; Advanced high strength steels	RETAINED AUSTENITE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TRIP STEELS; TENSILE PROPERTIES; HEAT-TREATMENT; MICROSTRUCTURE; BEHAVIOR; ENHANCEMENT; FRACTION; BAINITE	The effect of phase constitution on the ductility of a low-alloy transformation induced plasticity (TRIP)assisted steel was studied. The processing parameters were selected in such a way to obtain microstructures with systematically different volume fractions of ferrite, bainitic ferrite, martensite, and retained austenite, while keeping the grain size of ferrite and morphology of bainitic ferrite almost the same among various cases. Uniaxial tensile testing was performed at room temperature to examine the strength and ductility for each microstructure. It was observed that the ratio of carbon content to volume fraction of retained austenite is a better indicator of uniform strain than only carbon content or volume fraction. Regardless, martensite was found to be the main factor controlling the ductility. An almost linear relationship between tensile ductility and the volume fraction of martensite was observed up to 40% of martensite. The results also suggested that maximizing ferrite is a more direct design strategy for good ductility since increasing ferrite content reduces martensite volume fraction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigate CO2-oil-water-rock-interactions under reservoir conditions (100 degrees C and 24 MPa) in order to understand the fluid rock interactions following termination of a CO2-EOR project. Our experimental results show that CO2-rich fluid remained the active fluid controlling the dissolution precipitation processes in an oil-undersaturated sandstone reservoir; e.g., the dissolution of feldspar and calcite, and the precipitation of kaolinite as well as solid phases comprising O, Si, Al, Na, C, and Ti. Mineral dissolution rates were reduced in the case that mineral surfaces were coated by oil. Mineral wettability and composition, and oil saturation were the main controls on the exposed surface area of grains, and mineral wettability in particular led to selective dissolution. In addition, the permeability of the reservoir decreased substantially due to the precipitation of kaolinite and solid-phase particles, and due to the clogging of less soluble mineral particles released by the dissolution of K-feldspar and carbonate cement, whereas porosity increased. The results provide insight into potential formation damage resulting from CO2-EOR projects.. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, a low-cost, simple, and easy-to-scale method to develop sustainable and cost-effective ORR carbocatalysts via impregnation followed by pyrolysis of different renewable woody biomass is reported. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption near edge structure measurements show that the nitrogen- and phosphorus-promoted atomically dispersed iron is mainly responsible for the high ORR activity. Moreover, by a mimic of the natural pine materials derived Fe-based electrocatalyst, introducing external Fe precursor into the biomass can generate targeted well dispersed Fe complex catalysts, which is not very much dependent on the biomass types. The insights revealed here can shed new light on the development of sustainable and cost-effective ORR carbocatalysts from biomass.

This study revealed: (1) optimal initial GML concentration was 11.7 g/L (10 g/L sugars contained); (2) optimal XML feeding strategy was pseudo-exponential fed-batch and feeding time was 12th h-54th h, amounting to 25.7 g/L XML (20 g/L sugars contained); and (3) in a 7.5-L bioreactor, welan gum concentration was 22.68 +/- 0.50 g/L and its yield reached 0.756 g/g sugars with trace residual sugars. Compared with the cost of batch fermentation using glucose as sole carbon source, the final carbon source costs decreased by 61.40% and the welan gum yield increased by 50%. GML and XML can be used as inexpensive carbon sources for welan gum production with higher yield, giving them industrial application potential to produce value-added chemicals.

Stable anodes for lithium-ion batteries based on tin-containing silicon oxycarbonitride ceramic nanocomposites	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Metal-containing precursors; Polymer-derived ceramics; Tin nanoparticles; Lithium-ion batteries; Anode materials	POLYMER-DERIVED-SICN; SN-C COMPOSITE; GRAPHENE AEROGEL; SIOC CERAMICS; PERFORMANCE; CARBON; SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTRODES; LITHIATION; EVOLUTION	Tin nanoparticles are a promising candidate for Li-ion battery anodes to replace carbon materials due to their high theoretical Li-ion storage capacity (994 mAh/g), which is much higher than that of graphite (372 mAh/g). However, the poor cycling stability of tin emerged from large volume expansion, and contraction remains a challenging issue. To overcome these limitations, we designed Sn-containing silicon oxycarbonitride ceramic nanocomposites (Sn/SiOCN) by the chemical reaction of tin acetate with poly(vinyl)silazane Durazane 1800 in ice bath under argon, followed by the pyrolysis of as-obtained precursors at 1000 degrees C for 3 h under argon atmosphere. The Sn/SiOCH nanocomposites with different Sn contents are tested as anodes for lithium-ion batteries, delivering a high-discharge capacity of similar to 320 mAh/g at a current density of 2220 mA/g and extremely long cycling stability even at high charging rates (approximately 90% of the capacity is maintained after 1000 cycles). The outstanding electrochemical performance of Sn/SiOCH nanocomposites can be attributed to the improved charge transfer process due to the incorporation of metallic Sn nanoparticles into the amorphous SiOCN ceramic matrix, as revealed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization. In situ XRD results confirm the formation of lithium-rich alloy phase Li7Sn2 during the lithiation process. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Functionalization of a GaSe monolayer by vacancy and chemical element doping	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							MOS2; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; NANOPARTICLES; ADSORPTION; MAGNETISM; DEFECTS; SURFACE; PHASE	Based on first-principles plane-wave calculations, functionalization of the two-dimensional single-layered GaSe structure through vacancy and chemical element doping has been investigated. Our calculations show that the pristine GaSe monolayer, which is normally a non-magnetic, indirect-band-gap semiconductor, can induce net magnetic moments by introduction of Ga mono-vacancy, Ga di-vacancy, and GaSe3 and Ga2Se6 vacancy complexes. Magnetic moments can also be induced by selectively doping specific transition-metal atoms as well as A group atoms. The introduced donor or acceptor states are localized in the band gap, which expands the utilization of the single-layered GaSe in nanoelectronics and spintronics. In spite of the intrinsic p-type character of the two-dimensional GaSe material, substitution of Si for Ga and substitution of Cl for Se exhibit n-type character at relatively low dopant concentrations. These findings will provide useful supplements to the experimental studies on the newly synthesized two-dimensional layered metal monochalcogenides, which allows us to go beyond the current scope that is limited to applications within graphene, BN, and transition-metal dichalcogenide-based nanostructures.

When pH was at 7, ethanol/SO42- ratio rose from 0 to 5, and sulfate reduction rate went up from 5 - 7% to 85 - 89%; the removal efficiency of COD from 82 to 89%. When sucrose was the only organic carbon source, the sulfate reduction rate was 55 - 57% with pH at 6 and 47 - 49% with pH at 5. Correspondingly, the COD removal efficiencies were 46 - 49% and 8 - 10%, respectively. When ethanol was added as part of the carbon source, the sulfate reduction rates rose to 88 - 91% and 60 - 71% respectively, and COD removal efficiencies were 56 - 61% with pH at 6 and 27 - 29% with pH at 5. Decrease of pH resulted in significant decline of specific methanogenic activity and high accumulation of volatile fatty acid. Addition of ethanol promoted sulfate reduction rate and facilitated good synergetic metabolism of sulfate-reducing and methane-producing bacteria. The results presented in this paper provide some useful information for the optimization of sulfate-reducing processes in wastewater treatment.

Comparison of particulate formation and ash deposition under oxy-fuel and conventional pulverized coal combustions	FUEL			English	Article						Oxy-coal combustion; Recycled flue gas; Ash particles; Ash deposition	PARTICLE FORMATION; BEHAVIOR; NOX; TECHNOLOGY; REDUCTION; IGNITION; MATTER; STATE; CO2	The characteristics of both particulate formation and ash deposition play an important role in retrofitting the conventional air-fired coal power plant into the recycled oxy-fuel plant. In this paper, an intensively comparative study was performed with a 25 kW quasi one-dimensional down-fired pulverized coal combustor for clarifying the differences between air combustion and recycled oxy-fuel combustion of bituminous coal. In oxy-fuel mode, the volume recycle ratio of flue gas (dry basis) was kept at 77.8%, and then the oxygen concentration at 30% to provide a similar heat flux output to the air mode. A nitrogen-aspirated, isokinetic particulate sampling probe, followed by either electric low-pressure impactor (ELPI) or scanning mobility particle spectroscopy (SMPS), was introduced to measure fine particulates, while an air-cooled deposition probe was designed to collect ash deposit samples. The results indicated that, under similar furnace temperature profiles, the oxy-fuel combustion leads to the higher fine particulate formation, finer bulk ash particle formation and lower ash deposition.

We compare reaction pathways both in the absence and presence of water molecules in the vicinity of the active site and find that water effectively determines the selectivity in Na-Sn-BEA. We identify two competing epimerization pathways, one involving direct 1,2-carbon shift and the other involving 1,2-hydride shift via fructose. In Sn-BEA, the isomerization to fructose is the kinetically dominant pathway, while mannose is formed via the indirect 1,2-hydride shift epimerization pathway. In Na-Sn-BEA, the kinetically dominant pathway is epimerization to mannose via the direct 1,2-carbon shift pathway (Bilik mechanism) only in the presence of water solvent in the vicinity of the active site, whereas isomerization is preferred in the absence of water. We argue that polar water molecules that coordinate around the Na cation screen strong electrostatic interactions between Na' and the glucose backbone that are responsible for the strong inhibition of the 1,2-carbon shift mechanism in the absence of water. In Sn-BEA, the presence of water does not influence the selectivity. Our calculations resolve for the first time the role of water and Na cations in the catalytic activity of Sn-BEA, and rationalize the experimental data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With phenanthrene (PHE) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) as target pollutants, different iron-carbon (Fe-C) micro-electrolysis systems have been established. The effects of initial pH, Fe/C mass ratio, and intake air flow on the degradation and mineralization of PHE and 2,4-DCP were studied. At the initial pH of 5.0, Fe/C of 1.5:1, and an aeration flow rate of 1.5 L/min, after 120 min of reaction, the removal efficiency of FHE and COD was 94.3% and 73%, respectively. Under the conditions of initial pH is 3.0, Fe/C is 1:2, aeration flow rate of 1.5 L/min, and reaction time of 90 min, the best removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP can be obtained in the Fe-C micro-electrolysis system as 97% and COD removal efficiency can reach 76%. The results of kinetic studies show that the Fe-C micro-electrolysis process of PHE and 2,4-DCP follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. Commercial activated carbon (AC) was used for comparison under the same condition. The results indicated that the removal rate of organic pollutants and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of Fe-C micro-electrolysis were superior to that of AC. Analyze the structure of iron after reaction by SEM and XRD. The degradation pathway and mechanism for PHE and 2,4-DCP were proposed based on LC-MS analyses of treated wastewater.

Nevertheless, taking into consideration of harsh space condition, the friction and wear behavior of TPI composite were also explored after atomic oxygen (AO) irradiation. It reveals that TPI composite behaves excellent properties against AO mainly attributed to g-C3N4 with more negative electronegativity N than carbon atom. Moreover, the mechanism of friction and wear demonstrated that degradation caused by AO led to TPI composite surface with special "carpet-like" morphology and this resulted into lubrication failure, especially when temperature was increased from 200 degrees C to 350 degrees C.

Herein, we synthesized Z67, Z67-8 and Z67-8@C derived from metal-organic frameworks (M0Fs) by a facile preparation method, and systematically investigated their electromagnetic wave absorption performances respectively. The results show that hollow structured Co-C@C (Z67-8@C) has the best performance. As-prepared Co-C@C achieves a maximum RL of -58.1 dB at 11.52 GHz with an effective absorbing bandwidth (RL less than -10 dB) of 4.56 GHz (9.36-13.92 GHz) when the thickness is only 2.5 mm. Subsequent research verified that such excellent microwave absorption performance of Co-C@C was benefited from the favorable impedance matching. And the cavity inside the material can enhance the absorption performance by multiple scattering and refraction of electromagnetic waves. It is believed that the unique magnetic hollow structure Co-C@C composite material has the potential as a highly efficient microwave absorption material. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we show, both experimentally and computationally, a new design strategy for capturing CO2 in nanoporous adsorbents. The approach involves 'complementary organic motifs' (COMs), which have a precise alignment of charge densities that is complementary to the CO2 quadrupole. Two promising COMs were post-synthetically incorporated into a robust metal-organic framework (MOF) material using solvent-assisted ligand incorporation (SALI). We demonstrate that these COM-functionalized MOFs exhibit high capacity and selectivity for CO2 relative to other reported motifs.

The role of leaf water potential in the temperature response of mesophyll conductance	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						carbon isotope; leaf water potential; mesophyll conductance; photosynthesis; rice; stomatal conductance; temperature; wheat	RICE ORYZA-SATIVA; CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; GAS-EXCHANGE; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; CO2 DIFFUSION; INTERNAL CONDUCTANCE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATE; LEAVES; C-3	Variation in temperature (T) is usually accompanied by changes in leaf water potential (psi(leaf)), which may influence mesophyll conductance (g(m)). However, the effects of psi(leaf) on g(m) have not yet been considered in models of the g(m) response to temperature. Temperature responses of g(m) and psi(leaf) and the response of g(m) to psi(leaf) were studied in rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), and then an empirical model of psi(leaf) was incorporated into an existing g(m)-T model. In wheat, psi(leaf) was dramatically decreased with increasing T, whereas in rice psi(leaf) was less sensitive or insensitive to T. Without taking psi(leaf) into account, g(m) for wheat showed no response to T. However, at a given psi(leaf), g(m) was significantly higher at high temperature compared with low. After incorporating the function of psi(leaf) into the g(m)-T model, we suggest that the g(m)-T relationship can be influenced by the activation and deactivation energy for membrane permeability, psi(leaf) gradient between temperatures, and the sensitivity of g(m) to psi(leaf), below a threshold (psi(leaf,0)). The data presented here suggest that psi(leaf) plays an important role in the g(m)-T relationship and should be considered in future studies related to the temperature response of g(m) and photosynthesis.

Eleven singlet and two triplet stable points, 21 singlet and 11 triplet transition states are found. The results show that the reaction has two attacking modes, which are HNC attacking carbon-oxygen and carbon-carbon double bond of pentafulvenone. The reaction is more favourable in singlet state, and the dominant pathway is to form cyclopentadienyl isocyanide P[image omitted] via TS6. The structure of the most stable product is identified. The interconversions between cyclopentadienyl isocyanides and cyclopentadienyl cyanides are thoroughly studied in the singlet state.

The results demonstrated that the cyano group at one end of the carbon of 5-CVAM is more reactive than the amide group at the other end, under the same experimental conditions. The relations between 5-CVAM concentration and residence time revealed that hydrolysis of 5-CVAM shows second-order reaction kinetics in the investigated temperature range. The rate constants, average apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor were evaluated according to the Arrhenius equation. Based on the experimental results, a carbon balance was calculated, and a hydrolysis reaction scheme of 5-CVAM was proposed.

Establishing size effects in discontinuous fibre composites using 2D finite element analysis	COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st International Workshop on Computational Mechanics of Materials (IWCMM)	AUG 22-24, 2011	Univ Limerick, Limerick, IRELAND		Univ Limerick	Carbon fibres; Discontinues fibre composites; Finite element analysis; RVE	REPRESENTATIVE VOLUME ELEMENT; ELASTIC PROPERTIES	Size effects are observed within discontinuous fibre composites, such that the material properties change with the specimen volume. Representative volume elements (RVEs) are commonly used to simulate random fibre architectures for finite element analysis of discontinuous fibre composites. A series of simplified 2D RVE models have been created and studied in this paper, in order to determine the relationship between the critical RVE size and fibre length and volume fraction. All models are subjected to periodic boundary conditions, but average properties are extracted from an inner region offset from the model boundary by a distance equivalent to two fibre lengths. According to Saint-Venant's principle, this offset removes the uncertainty associated with the approximate boundary conditions. A statistical stopping criterion has been adopted to determine the number of realisations required to achieve a representative set of elastic properties for each fibre architecture. The critical RVE side length is shown to be approximately four times the fibre length when considering convergence of the tensile and shear stiffnesses for the range of fibre lengths and volume fractions studied.

Together with the vapor deposition strategy, the volatile nitrogen species from the pyrolysis of dicyandiamide were captured by the nano-octahedral materials, and formed tungsten-molybdenum-based carbonitride nanocrystals encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon. The porous nano-octahedron has a unique heterostructure composed of Mo2N/ MoC/W2N/WC. The representative MoWN/MoWC@N-C-800 showed trifunctional electrocatalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction/hydrogen evolution reaction (ORR/OER/HER) in an alkaline medium (0.1 M KOH). The total oxygen electrode activity index Delta E = 0.795 V (vs. RHE) was found in OER/ORR, and the material also exhibits excellent HER performance. The minimum potential of -0.17 V (vs. RHE) was provided at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2). MoWN/MoWC@N-C-800 showed excellent cycle stability and durability in ORR/OER/HER with the same electrolyte (0.1 M KOH). More importantly, MoWN/MoWC@N-C-800 could be used to construct high-performance zinc-air batteries and sued for driving electrocatalytic water splitting in a self-powered manner. The successful preparation of the materials indicate that the synthetic strategy provides new reference ideas for developing functional materials with high catalytic properties for various applications.

Marked advantage of amorphous columnar silicon anodes over composite graphite was demonstrated in 0- -30 degrees C, especially -20- -30 degrees C temperature range. Much higher gravimetric and volumetric capacities of Si binder free anodes compared to composite graphite electrodes provide great promise for their application in Li ion batteries at low temperature conditions.

Oriented macroscopic Ti3C2Tx fibers can be fabricated from a colloidal 2D nematic phase dispersion. The layered conductive Ti3C2Tx fibers are ideal candidates for constructing high-speed ionic transport channels to enhance the electrochemical capacitive charge storage performance. In this work, we assemble Ti3C2Tx fibers with a high degree of flake orientation by a wet spinning process with controlled spinning speeds and morphology of the spinneret. In addition to the effects of cross-linking of magnesium ions between Ti3C2Tx flakes, the electronic conductivity and mechanical strength of the as-prepared fibers have been improved to 7200 S cm(-1) and 118 MPa, respectively. The oriented Ti3C2Tx fibers present a volumetric capacitive charge storage capability of up to 1360 F cm(-3) even in a Mg-ion based neutral electrolyte, with contributions from both nanofluidic ion transport and Mg-ion intercalation pseudocapacitance. The oriented 2D Ti3C2Tx driven nanofluidic channels with great electronic conductivity and mechanical strength endows the MXene fibers with attributes for serving as conductive ionic cables and active materials for fiber-type capacitive electrochemical energy storage, biosensors, and potentially biocompatible fibrillar tissues.

Here, we developed a biomass-assisted pyrolysis-etching-activation (PEA) strategy to construct ISAS metal decorated on N and B co-doped porous carbon (ISAS M/NBPC, M = Co, Fe, or Ni) catalysts. This PEA strategy can be applied in the universal and large-scale preparation of ISAS catalysts. Interestingly, the ISAS M/NBPC (M = Co, Fe, or Ni) catalysts show multi-functional features and excellent catalytic activities. They can be used to conduct different types of catalytic reactions, such as O-silylation (OSI), oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), and transfer hydrogenation (THG). In addition, we used the transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene as a typical reaction and revealed the difference between ISAS Co/NBPC and ISAS Co/NPC (N-doped porous carbon) catalysts by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and which showed that the decreased barrier of the rate-determining step and the low-lying potential energy diagram indicate that the catalytic activity is higher when ISAS Co/NBPC is used than that when ISAS Co/NPC is used. These results demonstrate that the catalytic performance can be effectively improved by adjusting the coordination environment around the ISAS.

Amidst its development, excess dopants (e.g., nitrogen) are always required to ensure the high loading content of SACs on the carbon support. However, the use of excess dopants is accompanied by formation of miscellaneous structures (particularly the uncoordinated N species) on catalysts, leading to adverse effects on their performance. Herein, the synthesis of carbon-supported Ni SACs with precisely controlled single-atom structure via joule heating strategy, showing the coordination of 80% of N dopants with metal elements, is reported. The preclusion of the unfavorable N species is confirmed to be the main reason for the superior performance of optimized Ni SACs in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction, which demonstrates unprecedented activity, selectivity, and stability under an exceptionally broad voltage range (>92% CO selectivity in the range of -0.7 to -1.9 V reversible hydrogen electrode). Such a synthetic strategy is further applicable for the design of SACs with various metals. This work demonstrates a facile method for preclusion of unfavorable dopants in the SACs and its importance in catalytic application.

While fuel cell, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors are far from technical jargon in today's world, the sheer number of these devices is not accurately exhibited in the consumer market. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of crystalline materials consisting of metal ion nodes and organic linkers that has shown promise in the fields of gas capture, gas storage, separations, catalysis, magnetism, fluorescence, and sensing to name only a few. The use of these materials as self-sacrificing templates, via calcination or pyrolysis, for the design of green energy generation and storage devices is the focus of this review.

However, few studies have paid attention to the ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) of restored degraded alpine steppes. Four treatments of alpine steppes (degraded alpine steppes, cultivated alpine steppes, fenced alpine steppes and intact alpine steppes) were investigated to explore the effect of treatment, biotic (above- and belowground community composition) and abiotic factors (pH and soil moisture) on restoring nine ecosystem functions (above- and belowground plant biomass, plant nitrogen content, soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen, soil phosphorus, soil microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen and microbial biomass phosphorus) and EMF of alpine steppe ecosystem in Madoi County of Qinghai Province, China. Our results showed that both grassland cultivation and fencing significantly promoted EMF of the degraded alpine steppes. Aboveground plant community composition was more significantly correlated with EMF of the alpine steppes than belowground soil community composition in the process of ecological restoration. Combining abiotic factors with biotic factors could improve the ability to explain EMF than biotic factors alone. Overall, aboveground community composition and soil moisture played determining roles in restoring EMF of alpine steppes.

Very recent experiments have provided clear evidence for the presence of larger multi-vacancies in silicene, but their structure, stability, and formation mechanism remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a detailed theoretical study of silicene monolayer containing three types of defects: vacancy clusters, extended line defects (ELDs), and di-adatoms. First-principles calculations, along with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, revealed the coalescence tendency of small defects and formation of highly stable vacancy clusters. The 5|8|5 ELD - the most favorable extended defect in both graphene and silicene sheets - is found to be easier to form in the latter case due to the mixed sp(2)/sp(3) hybridization of silicon. In addition, hybrid functional calculations that contain part of the Hatree-Fock exchange energy demonstrated that the introduction of single and double silicon adatoms significantly enhances the stability of the system, and provides an effective approach on tuning the magnetic moment and band gap of silicene.

In this study, a genetically modified K. lactis with high-level expression of alpha-amylase from Rhizopus oryzae was obtained, which could successfully hydrolyze and use starch for growth very well. Shake flask fermentation indicated that, the recombinant yeast was able to produce the alpha-amylase at considerable secretion levels using a variety of carbon sources. The highest level of amylase expression was 22.4 U/ml when cultivated at 30 degrees C and pH 7.0 in the presence of galactose. Moreover, it was shown that the recombinant yeast, which could efficiently degrade starch, yielded a final biomass of 12.25 g/l with enzyme activity of 11 U/ml in the culture medium using 20 g soluble starch/l as the sole carbon source.

The months of July, October, January, and April were chosen to represent four different typical seasons. The total PM2.5 mass was measured. PM2.5 samples were used for the analysis of inorganic elements, ions, Organic Carbon (OC) and Elemental Carbon (EC). PM2.5 concentration in the industrial subdivision were generally higher than those in the residential subdivision. The annual mean PM2.5 concentrations were 196 mu g m(-3) for the industrial subdivision and 116 mu g m(-3) for the residential subdivision. The coefficients of divergence (CD) calculated for spring, summer, autumn and winter were 0.67, 0.35, 0.65, and 0.33, respectively. The Enrichment Factor Method (EFM) was used to help determine the original sources of these inorganic elements. Secondary water-soluble ions (SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+) were the major water soluble ions in the PM2.5 of Tangshan, and they are present in the atmosphere as (NH4)(2)SO4 and NH4NO3. The Sulfur Oxidation Ratio (SOR) and Nitrogen Oxidation Ratio (NOR) show that the precursor conversion ratio was highest in summer. At both subdivisions, winter had the highest monthly average OM concentration while summer had the lowest.

The demonstrated paper exhibits good conductivity due to the formation of a continuous coating of polyaniline (PANI) over the cellulose nanofibers (CNF) during in situ polymerization, which is evident from scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The free hydroxyl groups on the surface of nanocellulose fibers promptly form intermolecular hydrogen bonding with PANI, which plays a vital role in shielding electromagnetic radiations and makes the cellulose nanopapers even more robust. These composite nanopapers exhibited an average shielding effectiveness of ca. -23 dB (>99% attenuation) at 8.2 GHz with 1 mm paper thickness. The fabricated papers exhibited an effective attenuation of electromagnetic waves by a predominant absorption mechanism (ca. 87%) rather than reflection (ca. 13%), which is highly desirable for the present-day telecommunication sector. Unlike metal-based shields, these demonstrated PANI/CNF papers have given a new platform for designing green microwave attenuators via an absorption mechanism. The prime novelty of the present study is that these robust PANI/CNF nanopapers have the ability to attenuate incoming microwave radiations to an extent that is 360% higher than the shielding effectiveness value reported in the previous literature. This makes them suitable for use in commercial electronic gadgets. This demonstrated work also opens up new avenues for using cellulose nanofibers as an effective substrate for fabricating conductive flexible papers using polyaniline. The direct current conductivity value of PANI/CNF nanopaper was 0.314 S/cm, which is one of the key requisites for the fabrication of efficient electromagnetic shields. Nevertheless, such nanopapers also open up an arena of applications such as electrodes for supercapacitors, separators for Li-S, Li-polymer batteries, and other freestanding flexible paper-based devices.

Here, a 9-yr field experiment was conducted in northwestern China using treatments that included nine factorial combinations of three cultivation practices, conventional cultivation (CC), straw mulching (SM), and supplementary irrigation (SI), and three N application rates (0, 120, and 240 kg N ha(-1)). Relative yield gradually declined under CC and SM with N, yet remained steady under SI. Without N, yield decreased by 50 to 60%. Soil organic carbon (SOC), labile organic carbon (LOC), total nitrogen (TN), and available potassium (AK) in the 0 to 20 cm (upper) soil layer were significantly increased by SM but were unaffected by SI treatments. After wheat harvest, N application increased SOC, LOC, and TN in the upper soil layer by an average of 4.81, 20.70, and 7.61%, respectively, and decreased AK by 6.12%. The cultivation practice and N fertilizer effects on soil properties were more pronounced in upper than deeper layer (20-40 cm). At soil depths of 0 to 100 cm, nitrate accumulation under N-240 exceeded 69.27% of the critical environmental risk value. Thus, SI + N-120 achieved a high and stable wheat yield, and SM + N-120 increased soil fertility. However, the two combinations applied over 9 yr did not meet both high soil fertility and high productivity needs. Additionally, cultivation practices with high N fertilizer are not sustainable soil management techniques in dryland regions.

Under this condition, the durability of fuel cells will be a huge challenge for commercialization. In our study, a 1000-h durability experiment was performed on a PEMFC to investigate the durability under high back pressures. A semi-empirical fuel cell polarization curve model was used to separate the activation and concentration losses, and study their changes with testing time at different current densities. In addition, the charge transfer resistance (R-ct) related to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the catalyst layer was also investigated. Additionally, the mass transfer resistance (Z(d)) was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Moreover, the contact angle and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) of carbon paper surface were characterized. The results indicated that the increase in mass transfer resistance was the biggest contributor to the loss of cell voltage with testing time. The decrease in contact angle of carbon paper surface implied that the weakening of hydrophobicity contributed to an increase in the mass transfer resistance, which comes from the PTFE loss observed from EDX. This may result from the aggravated corrosion of carbon fiber or physical erosion induced by flooding in fuel cell under high back-pressure. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Sen, UK; Johari, P; Basu, S; Nayak, C; Mitra, S				Sen, Uttam Kumar; Johari, Priya; Basu, Sohini; Nayak, Chandrani; Mitra, Sagar			An experimental and computational study to understand the lithium storage mechanism in molybdenum disulfide	NANOSCALE			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; ELECTRON LOCALIZATION; ANODE MATERIAL; BATTERY ANODE; ION STORAGE; MOS2; NANOCOMPOSITES; ALPHA-MOO3; CARBON; NANOPARTICLES	The lithium storage mechanism in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been comprehensively investigated as the existing conversion-based storage mechanism is unable to explain the reason behind its high practical capacity, high polarization losses, and the change in the discharge profile after the 1(st) charge-discharge cycle. To resolve these issues and to gain a deeper understanding of MoS2-based Li-ion batteries, for the first time, we have studied the reaction mechanism of the MoS2 anode using various experimental techniques such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, XANES, and EXAFS, as well as ab initio density functional theory based calculations. On the basis of the results presented here, and in line with some experimental findings, we find that the reaction of MoS2 with Li is not as simple as with usual metal oxide based conversion reactions, but that the pathway of the conversion reaction changes after the first discharge process. In the first discharge process, lithiation is initiated by a limited intercalation process, followed by a conversion reaction that produces molybdenum nanoparticles (Mo) and lithium sulfide (Li2S). Whereas, unlike oxide-based conversion materials, MoS2 does not transverse back during the delithiation process. Indeed, instead of MoS2 formation, we identified the presence of polysulfur after the complete cycle. In consecutive cycles, polysulfur reacts with lithium and forms Li2S/Li2S2, and this Li-S reaction is found to be highly reversible in nature and the only source of the high practical capacity observed in this electrode. To validate our experimental findings, an atomic scale ab initio computational study was also carried out, which likewise suggests that Li first intercalates between the MoS2 layers but that after a certain concentration, it reacts with MoS2 to form Li2S. The calculations also support the non-reversibility of the conversion reaction, by showing that Mo + Li2S formation is energetically more favorable than the re-formation of MoS2 + Li.

As two of vital signal molecules, development of biosensors for monitoring of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and pH invivo is significant to understand the roles of H2O2 and pH playing in rat brain followed by ischemia. Herein, a selective and accuracy ratiometric electrochemical biosensor was developed for quantifying H2O2 and pH through both current and potential outputs in a rat brain upon ischemia. Catalase (Cat) was first employed as a specific recognition element for both H2O2 and pH. Meanwhile, an inner reference molecule, ferrocene (Fc), independent of H2O2 and pH, was used as a built-in correction to improve the accuracy. The reduction peak current of Cat increased with increasing concentration of H2O2 from 1.0 to 230M. Meanwhile, the peak potential negatively shifted with increasing pH from 5.91 to 7.81, resulting in determination of H2O2 and pH. Thus, combined with the remarkable analytical performance of the developed biosensor and the desirable biocompatibility of carbon fibre microelectrode (CFME), a direct and reliable approach was established to monitoring H2O2 and pH in the microdialysates collected from rat brain followed by cerebral ischemia.

In this method, the resorcinol and formaldehyde (RF) were applied as carbon source to enhance the electrical conductivity of Mn3O4 microspheres. The resulting core shell Mn3O4@C microspheres comprised of irregular aggregated nanoparticles with an average diameter of approximately 2 mu m. The Mn3O4 microspheres were homogeneously coated by the carbon layers with a thickness of 50 nm. The Mn3O4@C microspheres exhibit dramatically excellent reversible discharge capacity of 913.8 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g after 300 cycles with an outstanding rate capability. The discharge capacity of Mn3O4@C microspheres could maintain up to 992 mAh/g even after 800 cycles at 1 A/g. The improved electrochemical performance of the synthesized Mn3O4@C microspheres is attributed to the fact that the carbon shell structure can effectively buffer volume change, maintain structure Integrity and improve electrical conductivity. The Mn3O4@C microspheres could be utilized as a promising candidate as the anode material for lithium-ion batteries.

Wax molecular diffusion is recognized to play a crucial role in wax deposition. Empirical correlations of Hayduk-Minhas and Wilke-Chang are widely used to calculate the wax molecular diffusivity. However, they are developed based on binary solutions and underestimate the diffusion coefficient of wax components. To address this issue, wax deposition experiments with different crude oils were conducted in cold-finger apparatus. The temperature distribution was obtained by computational fluid dynamics software of Fluent and the characteristics of wax deposit were investigated. In addition, the wax molecular diffusion process under saturated and partial saturated conditions were theoretically elucidated. It was found that the bulk temperature, deposition duration and carbon number distribution of wax molecules can significantly influence the total wax content and wax precipitation properties of wax deposits. Moreover, the wax molecular diffusivity experimentally calculated based on the Fick's first law were found larger than that obtained by correlations of Hayduk-Minhas and Wilke-Chang. A new correlation calculating the wax diffusion in crude oil was developed and verified with experiments. Good agreement between predicted and experimental values was observed with maximum relative deviation being 12.52% and mean absolute error being 8.90%. This new correlation is suitable in wax molecular diffusivity calculation for crude oils.

This fast evolved gas analysis system was applied to the study of the simultaneous evolution of low molecular weight gas phase products, such as CO, CO2, H2O, CH4, C2H4, and CH2O during the pyrolysis of cellulose. Different pyrolytic conditions, including heating rate, gas flow rate, and residence time, were tested to study their effects on the formation of gaseous compounds during cellulose pyrolysis. Formaldehyde and carbon monoxide formations were observed to have a strong heating rate dependence, whereas carbon dioxide formation showed little dependence with the heating rate. Efforts were made to achieve a well-controlled heating environment and sample temperature measurement. The pyrolysis of levoglucosan, a major component of tar and a primary pyrolysis product of cellulose, was also studied. Comparison of the pyrolysis products from cellulose and levoglucosan showed great similarities and provided insight into the precursors and formation mechanisms of gas phase products. This experimental method provides a technique to analyze evolved gases in real time, information on reaction mechanisms, and a method to distinguish and control primary and secondary reactions.

By tunning carbonization temperatures (from 450 to 650 degrees C), a series of CS/ZIF-8/MSNs carbonaceous millimetre-sized spheres with honeycomb internal structures and hierarchical pores have been developed for CO2 uptake. CS/ZIF-8/MSNs-525 (the sample treated at 525 degrees C) exhibited a higher CO2 capacity (1.32 mmol/g, 1 atm) than that of other samples due to its appropriate mesopores (similar to 11 nm), micropores (similar to 0.73 nm) and BET surface area (similar to 459.2 m(2)g(-1)). The XRD pattern of CS/ZIF-8/MSNs-525 suggested that MSNs would not affect sample structure, which performed largely maintained ZIF-8 diffraction. The SEM/EDS image of CS/ZIF-8/MSNs-525 showed that MSNs (similar to 50 nm) has been well decorated onto the surface of ZIF-8 by in situ assembly and carbonization, thus indicating a hierarchical structure formed. In addition, the TG-MS technology has been also utilized to clarify that MSNs assembly would not affect the carbonization process during the formation of CS/ZIF-8/MSNs-525. Moreover, the addition of MSNs facilitated a proper pore structure and higher CO2 capacity of CS/ZIF-8/MSNs-525 compared with that of CS/ZIF-8 carbon spheres (0.9 mmol/g, 1 atm). Particularly, the CS/ZIF-8/MSNs-525 exhibited excellent stability and recyclable performance after CO2 adsorption in 10 adsorption-desorption cycles. This MSNs assembly strategy could induce a simple way for obtaining novel shaped carbonaceous adsorbent for superior CO2 uptake in industrial fields.

A macrocyclic furan-containing CPP precursor was used for the Diels-Alder reaction with the parent benzyne or 3,6-dimethexybenzyne to form the corresponding macrocyclic carbon frameworks. The subsequent reductive deoxygenation of the Diels-Alder adducts with Fe-2(CO)(9) followed by oxidative aromatization with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone produced the functionalized [12]CPPs. The effect of macrocyclic ring size on the reaction rate of oxidative aromatization was investigated.

Vinyl and SiCH3 units can react with Si-H, SiCH3 and Si-CH2-Si groups below 400 degrees C. These crosslinking reactions can increase the ceramic yield of the blended precursors. At 500 degrees C aromatic carbon is formed, and N-H and Si-H groups vanish at 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C, respectively. At 600 degrees C, SiCH3 and Si-H units can further react with SiCN3, SiC2N2, N-H and C-H units. An amount of amorphous carbon and CSi4 and CSi3H groups are detectable at 800 degrees C. Even at this temperature there are still many aromatic protons. In addition, there are also SiC4, SiC3N, SiCN3 and SiN4 units. Silicon forms SiN4 more readily than SiC4. Many AlN5 groups transform into AlN6 groups. The D and G bands of graphite are observed in CA pyrolyzed at 1400 degrees C. According to the XRD patterns, the reflection of crystalline beta-Si3N4 vanishes at 1700 degrees C, and the residue pyrolyzed at 1800 degrees C mainly contains a large number of 2H-SiC/AlN solid solution crystals and a few beta-SiC crystals.

Based on carbon monoxide deflagration experiments, the paper presents a multi-zone integration model for calculation of on-way peak overpressure, in which the tube with obstacles is considered as a series of venting explosion enclosures which link each others. The analysis of experimental data indicates that the on-way peak overpressure of gas deflagration can be correlated as an empirical formula with equivalence ratio of carbon monoxide oxidation, expansion ratio, flame path length, etc., and that the on-way peak overpressure exhibits a linear relationship with turbulence factor and flame propagation speed. An empirical formula of flame propagation speed is given.

To resolve these issues and to gain a deeper understanding of MoS2-based Li-ion batteries, for the first time, we have studied the reaction mechanism of the MoS2 anode using various experimental techniques such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, XANES, and EXAFS, as well as ab initio density functional theory based calculations. On the basis of the results presented here, and in line with some experimental findings, we find that the reaction of MoS2 with Li is not as simple as with usual metal oxide based conversion reactions, but that the pathway of the conversion reaction changes after the first discharge process. In the first discharge process, lithiation is initiated by a limited intercalation process, followed by a conversion reaction that produces molybdenum nanoparticles (Mo) and lithium sulfide (Li2S). Whereas, unlike oxide-based conversion materials, MoS2 does not transverse back during the delithiation process. Indeed, instead of MoS2 formation, we identified the presence of polysulfur after the complete cycle. In consecutive cycles, polysulfur reacts with lithium and forms Li2S/Li2S2, and this Li-S reaction is found to be highly reversible in nature and the only source of the high practical capacity observed in this electrode. To validate our experimental findings, an atomic scale ab initio computational study was also carried out, which likewise suggests that Li first intercalates between the MoS2 layers but that after a certain concentration, it reacts with MoS2 to form Li2S. The calculations also support the non-reversibility of the conversion reaction, by showing that Mo + Li2S formation is energetically more favorable than the re-formation of MoS2 + Li.

This success is the result of intense collaboration between academia and industry over the past several decades, culminating with the advent of and improvements in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. As applications become more demanding, there is the risk that stunted growth in the performance of commercial batteries will slow the adoption of important technologies such as electric vehicles. Yet the scientific literature includes many reports describing material designs with allegedly superior performance. A considerable gap needs to be filled if we wish these laboratory-based achievements to reach commercialization. In this Perspective, we discuss some of the most relevant testing parameters that are often overlooked in academic literature but are critical for practical applicability outside the laboratory. We explain metrics such as anode energy density, voltage hysteresis, mass of non-active cell components and anode/cathode mass ratio, and we make recommendations for future reporting. We hope that this Perspective, together with other similar guiding principles that have recently started to emerge, will aid the transition from lab-scale research to next-generation practical batteries.

The respiration of mycelia was partially inhibited by the cytochrome respiration inhibitor antimycin A or the alternative respiration inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid and was completely inhibited in the presence of both antimycin A and salicylhydroxamic acid. During fumaric acid fermentation process, the activity of alternative respiration had a great correlation with fumaric acid productivity; both of them reached peak at the same time. The alternative oxidase gene, which encoded the mitochondrial alternative oxidase responsible for alternative respiration in R. oryzae ME-F14, was cloned and characterized in Escherichia coli. The activity of alternative respiration, the alternative oxidase gene transcription level, as well as the fumaric acid titer were measured under different carbon sources and different carbon-nitrogen ratios. The activity of alternative respiration was found to be comparable to the transcription level of the alternative oxidase gene and the fumaric acid titer. These results indicated that the activity of the alternative oxidase was regulated at the transcription stage under the conditions tested for R. oryzae ME-F14.

Improving the responses of the Australian community land surface model (CABLE) to seasonal drought	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							ROOT-WATER-UPTAKE; AMAZONIAN RAIN-FOREST; HYDRAULIC REDISTRIBUTION; EDDY COVARIANCE; ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION; ARTEMISIA-TRIDENTATA; NONLINEAR INVERSION; XYLEM STRUCTURE; SOIL-WATER; CARBON	Correct representations of root functioning, such as root water uptake and hydraulic redistribution, are critically important for modeling the responses of vegetation to droughts and seasonal changes in soil moisture content. However, these processes are poorly represented in global land surface models. In this study, we incorporated two root functions: a root water uptake function which assumes root water uptake efficiency varies with rooting depth, and a hydraulic redistribution function into a global land surface model, CABLE. The water uptake function developed by Lai and Katul (2000) was also compared with the default one (see Wang et al., 2010) that assumes that efficiency of water uptake per unit root length is constant. Using eddy flux measurements of CO2 and water vapor fluxes at three sites experiencing different patterns of seasonal changes in soil water content, we showed that the two root functions significantly improved the agreement between the simulated fluxes of net ecosystem exchange and latent heat flux and soil moisture dynamics with those observed during the dry season while having little impact on the model simulation during the wet seasons at all three sites. Sensitivity analysis showed that varying several model parameters influencing soil water dynamics in CABLE did not significantly affect the model's performance. We conclude that these root functions represent a valuable improvement for land surface modeling and should be implemented into CABLE and other land surface models for studying carbon and water dynamics where rainfall varies seasonally or interannually.

The physicochemical properties of as-obtained composites were systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The 4-CQDs/BiOCOOH/uCN consisting of 50 wt% ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets (uCN) and 4 mL CQDs solution manifested the optimal photoactivity. After 90 min of LED lamp irradiation, the STZ degradation efficiency by 4-CQDs/BiOCOOH/uCN reached 99.28% +/- 1.04, and the corresponding degree of mineralization was 49.58% +/- 1.36. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of 4-CQDs/BiOCOOH/uCN was owing to the fast photogenerated charges transfer and separation revealed by photoluminescence (PL), transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements. By means of the radicals quenching experiments and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) analysis, it was demonstrated that center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH were the dominant reactive species of STZ degradation. Besides, the effects of catalyst dosage (0.2-1.2 g/L), pH value (3.0-11.0), natural organic matter and different anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-) on the photocatalytic activity of 4-CQDs/BiOCOOH/uCN composite were systematically explored. 17 main intermediates were found based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) detection. Eventually, the 4-CQDs/BiOCOOH/uCN composite showed favorable reusability in recycling experiments, and displayed satisfactory degradation abilities for STZ in deionized water (99.28% +/- 1.04), tap water (97.15% +/- 1.16), river water (96.44% +/- 0.76), and wastewater treatment plant effluent (96.19% +/- 1.20).

To reduce power cost and carbon footprint, an increasing number of cloud service providers have considered green datacenters with renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind. However, unlike the stable supply of grid energy, it is challenging to utilize and realize renewable energy due to the uncertain, intermittent and variable nature. In this article, we provide a taxonomy of the state-of-the-art research in applying renewable energy in cloud computing datacenters from five key aspects, including generation models and prediction methods of renewable energy, capacity planning of green datacenters, intra-datacenter workload scheduling and load balancing across geographically distributed datacenters. By exploring new research challenges involved in managing the use of renewable energy in datacenters, this article attempts to address why, when, where and how to leverage renewable energy in datacenters, also with a focus on future research avenues.

Herein, 2D/2D NiCo-MOF/GO (NCMG) hybrid nanosheets are prepared by a simply ultrasonic method. GO nanosheets are evenly dispersed onto the surface of NiCo-MOF, constructing a conductive network, which not only enhances the electronic conductivity of NiCo-MOF nanosheets, but also efficiently prevents their aggregation. Benefiting from the unique structure of NCMG, its specific capacity is up to 413.61 C g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) constructed by NCMG and activated carbon presents a maximum energy density of 36.83 Wh kg- 1 at a power density of 374.99 W kg- 1. The results demonstrate that NCMG hybrid nanosheets have the promising potential application for efficient energy storage devices.

Here, copper nanoparticles supported on carbon (written as: Cu NP/C) and copper oxide polycrystalline solids (written as: CuO PS), synthesized by calcining the same metal-organic framework at high temperature, were respectively used as electrode materials for electrochemical sensing hydrazine. The results show that the prepared Cu NP/C exhibits a better performance with a sensitivity of 0.1726 mA (mmol/L)(-1), a wider linear range of 0.1-2.4 mM and a lower detection limit of 0.0014 mmol.L-1, compared to the obtained CuO PS. This can be reasonably explained by the lower copper valence state and its interaction with the carbon supports in Cu NP/C. Furthermore, the good selectivity and anti-interference ability from the Cu NP/C are also acquired for electrochemical detection of hydrazine.

Herein, we describe the preparation of a novel 3D nanostructured MnO2-based composite developed using a carbonized proteinaceous spongin template by an extreme biomimetics approach. The thermal stability of the spongin-based scaffold facilitated the formation of both carbonized material (at 650 degrees C with exclusion of oxygen) and manganese oxide with a defined nanoscale structure under 150 degrees C. Remarkably, the unique network of spongin fibers was maintained after pyrolysis and hydrothermal processing, yielding a novel porous support. The MnO2-spongin composite shows a bimodal pore distribution, with macropores originating from the spongin network and mesopores from the nanostructured oxidic coating. Interestingly, the composites also showed improved electrochemical properties compared to those of MnO2. Voltammetry cycling demonstrated the good stability of the material over more than 3,000 charging/discharging cycles. Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed lower charge transfer resistance in the prepared materials. We demonstrate the potential of extreme biomimetics for developing a new generation of nanostructured materials with 3D centimeter-scale architecture for the storage and conversion of energy generated from renewable natural sources.

Herein, we prepared a series of supported Ni catalysts by hydrothermal synthesis method particularly operated at the SCW region, and studied the activity and property stability of these newly developed catalysts for SCWG. Supporting materials studied for Ni include ZrO2, Ce-promoted ZrO2, Al2O3, Mgpromoted Al2O3, active carbon and carbon nanotube, and the supercritical water synthesis (SCWS) was conducted at 500 degrees C, 23 MPa in batch reactor using metallic nitrates as starting feed. SCWG results and catalyst characterization (XRD, SEM-EDS, N-2 adsorption/desorption and TGA) confirmed the high activity, superiorly stable crystalline structure and pore structure, and excellent regeneration ability of the SCWS-prepared catalysts (especially Ni/MgO-Al2O3) for SCWG reactions, showing that SCWS is a promising method to develop active and stable catalyst for SCWG process.

The effect of the maleic anhydride-grafted high density polyethylene (HDPEg-MAH) on the interaction was also investigated. The results showed that the interfacial interaction was greatly influenced by the degradation degree of ground tire rubber and the presence of HDPE-gMAH. During the melt process, a mechanochemical reaction between LLDPE and the degraded GTR was observed. The addition of the HDPE-g-MAH promoted a more homogeneous dispersion of degraded GTR in the LLDPE, and the thermal and mechanical performance of the composites was higher than those of without HDPA-g-MAH. The degraded molecular chains and the exposed carbon black reacted with the HDPA-g-MAH, which was confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The advent of novel analytical tools has led many workers to explore non-traditional geochemical and petrographic proxies, and work performed in neighbouring disciplines sheds light on the complex biomineralization strategies applied by these organisms. These considerations form a strong motivation to review the potential and problems related to the compilation and interpretation of proxy data from bivalve, cephalopod and brachiopod hard parts from the viewpoint of the sedimentologist and palaeoceanographer. Specific focus is on the complex biomineralization pathways of a given dissolved ion or food particle from its aquatic environment via the digestion and biomineralization apparatus in molluscs and brachiopods and its incorporation into a biomineral. Given that molluscs and brachiopods do not secrete their hard parts from seawater but rather from their mantle and periostracum, this paper evaluates differences and similarities of seawater versus that of body fluids. Cephalopods, bivalves and brachiopods exert a strong biological control on biomineralization that, to some degree, may buffer their shell geochemistry against secular changes in seawater chemistry. Disordered (amorphous) calcium carbonate precursor phases, later transformed to crystalline biominerals, may be significant in carbonate archive research due to expected geochemical offset relative to the direct precipitation of stable phases. A reasonable level of understanding of the related mechanisms is thus crucial for those who use these skeletal hard parts as archives of the palaeo-environment. The impact of what is commonly referred to as 'biological factors' on the geochemistry of mollusc and brachiopod hard parts is explored for conventional isotope systems such as carbon, oxygen, strontium and traditionally used element to calcium ratios. In particular, the often used delta C-13(carb) or the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca elemental proxies are fraught with problems. An interesting new research field represents the analysis, calibration and application of non-traditional proxies to mollusc and brachiopod hard parts. Examples include the carbonate clumped isotope (Delta(47)) approach and the analysis of the isotopes of Ca, Mg, N, Li, S or element to Ca ratios such as Li/Ca or B/Ca and rare earth elements. Based on considerations discussed here, a series of "do's and don'ts" in mollusc and brachiopod archive research are proposed and suggestions for future work are presented. In essence, the suggestions proposed here include experimental work (also field experiments) making use of recent archive organisms or, where possible, a reasonable recent analogue in the case of extinct groups. Moreover, the detailed understanding of the architecture of mollusc and brachiopod hard parts and their ultra-structures must guide sampling strategies for geochemical analyses. Where feasible, a detailed understanding of the diagenetic pathways and the application of multi-proxy and multi-archive approaches should form the foundation of fossil carbonate archive research. The uncritical compilation of large data sets from various carbonate-shelled organisms collected at different locations is not encouraged.

J	WANG, GQ; LIN, HN; LI, SS; HUANG, CH				WANG, GQ; LIN, HN; LI, SS; HUANG, CH			PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINES WITH SN-1 SATURATED AND SN-2 CIS-MONOUNSATURATED ACYL CHAINS - THEIR MELTING BEHAVIOR AND STRUCTURES	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MODEL MEMBRANES	Recently, we have shown by high resolution differential scanning calorimetry that the position of a cis double bond (Delta-bond) in a series of 1-stearoyl-2-octadecenoyl- phosphatidylcholines can affect the phase transition temperature (T-m) or enthalpy (Delta H) of the gel-to liquid crystalline phase transition of this series of lipids in the following manner. The value of T-m (or Delta H) is minimal when the Delta-bond is positioned at C(11) in the sn-2 acyl chain; in addition, this value increases steadily as the Delta-bond migrates toward either end of the acyl chain, resulting in a symmetrical, inverted bell shaped profile (Wang, Z.-q., Lin, H.-n., Li, S., and Huang, C. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2014-2023). In this communication, we have further demonstrated the inverted bell-shaped profile of T-m using 1-arachidoyl-2-eicosenoyl-phosphatidylcholines. In addition, we have extended the lipid series of 1-stearoyl-2-octadecenoyl-phosphatidylcholines to include 1-arachidoyl-2-octadecenoyl-phosphatidylcholines and 1-behenoyl-2-octadecenoyl-phosphatidylcholine, each series with a h-bond at varying carbon position of 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13. Calorimetric results obtained with these three series of Lipids indicate that the inverted bell-shaped curve shifts toward higher temperatures in a nonuniform manner as the saturated sn-l acyl chain length increases from 17 to 19 and then to 21 GC bond lengths. Specifically, the T-m (or Delta H) values are nearly identical for these cis-monoenoic lipids when their Delta-bonds are positioned at C(13). Eased on the height of the rotational energy barrier obtained with molecular mechanics calculations, it is evident that the rotational flexibility of the single C-C bond adjacent to the Delta-bond in 1-stearoyl-2-octadecenoyl-phosphatidylcholine increases as the Delta-bond migrates from C(9) to C(13). The differential scanning calorimetry results obtained with the three series of lipids can thus be attributed to an increase in the rotational flexibility of the short chain segment succeeding the C(14) atom in the sn-2 octadecenoyl chain. In this communication, we also propose that in the gel-state bilayer of sn-1 saturated/sn-2 cis-monounsaturated phosphatidylcholine the entire length of the shorter segment of the sn-2 acyl chain acts as a structural perturbing element; hence, it is mainly responsible for the large lower T-m of the monoenoic Lipid relative to the saturated counterpart, Finally, two general equations relating T-m with the structural parameters of cis-monoenoic phosphatidylcholines are presented. These equations, formulated primarily on the assumption that the short segment of the sn-2 acyl chain acts as a perturbing element, are shown to have strong predictive power in estimating the T-m values of the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transitions for sn-1 saturated/sn-2 cis-monounsaturated phosphatidylcholines.

However, the effects of the ETME on land is a controversial topic. Evaluation of the disparate cause(s) and effects of the extinction requires additional, detailed terrestrial records of these events. Here, we present a multidisciplinary record of volcanism and environmental change from an expanded Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) transition preserved in lacustrine sediments from the Jiyuan Basin, North China. High-resolution chemostratigraphy, palynological, kerogen, and sedimentological data reveal that terrestrial conditions responded to and were defined by large-scale volcanism. The record of sedimentary mercury reveals two discrete CAMP eruptive phases during the T-J transition. Each of these can be correlated with large, negative C isotope excursions (CIE-I of -4.7 parts per thousand; CIE-II of -2.9 parts per thousand), significantly reduced plant diversity (with ca. 45 and 44% generic losses, respectively), enhanced wildfire (marked by increased fusinite or charcoal content), and major climatic shifts toward drier and hotter conditions (indicated by the occurrence of calcareous nodules, increased Classopollis pollen content, and PCA analysis). Our results show that CAMP eruptions may have followed a bimodal eruptive model and demonstrate the powerful ability of large-scale volcanism to alter the global C cycle and profoundly affect the climate, in turn leading to enhanced wildfires and a collapse in land plant diversity during the T-J transition.

Boron analogues have been predicted, as boron atoms possess a short covalent radius and the flexibility to adopt sp(2) hybridization, features that favour the formation of two-dimensional allotropes, and one example of such a borophene material has been reported recently. Here, we present a parallel experimental work showing that two-dimensional boron sheets can be grown epitaxially on a Ag(111) substrate. Two types of boron sheet, a beta(12) sheet and a chi(3) sheet, both exhibiting a triangular lattice but with different arrangements of periodic holes, are observed by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Density functional theory simulations agree well with experiments, and indicate that both sheets are planar without obvious vertical undulations. The boron sheets are quite inert to oxidization and interact only weakly with their substrate. We envisage that such boron sheets may find applications in electronic devices in the future.

The Se molecules are confined by N-containing carbon ring structures in the form of energy-storing selenium side chains in the carbonized PAN matrix. This unique stable chemical structure with a conductive carbon skeleton connected to the selenium side chains and excellent mechanical stability can allow CPAN/Se composite cathodes to be charged and discharged in a low-cost carbonate-based electrolyte with excellent long cycle stability and quite good rate performance. The superior electrochemical performance of CPAN/Se electrodes is demonstrated in both lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, where they have delivered a high capacity of nearly 600 mA h g(-1) for 500 cycles in lithium-selenium (Li-Se) batteries and 410 mA h g(-1) for 300 cycles in sodium-selenium (Na-Se) batteries at 0.3 C, respectively.

In this work, BO2--intercalated alpha-NixCo(1-x)(OH)(2) is synthesized by a hydrothermal method at a low cost. The Co dopant can decrease the charge-transfer resistance and enhance the cyclic stability. The special unsaturated electronic state of BO(2)(- )enhances the bonding with metal ions and attracts water molecules. Thus, the BO2- ions support the hydroxide layers as pillars and create efficient paths for proton transportation, optimizing the utilization of alpha-Ni(OH)(2). The three-dimensional (3D) flowerlike morphology supplies an enormous number of active sites, and r-GO is added to improve the conductivity. As a result, the modified alpha-Ni(OH)(2) exhibits the specific capacitance of 2179, 1592, and 1423 F.g(-1) at 1, 20, and 40 A.g(-1), respectively, showing improved rate performance. Matching with the commercial activated carbon (AC) as an anode, the asymmetric capacitor delivers an energy density of 40.66 W.h.kg(-1) when its power density is 187.06 W.kg(-1). Meanwhile, it retains 81.5% capacitance of the initial cycle at 5 A.g(-1) after 3000 cycles. With conductivity enhanced and structure stabilized, the modified alpha-Ni(OH)(2) confronts broader fields of application.

The results showed that the Raman scattering cross section (RSCS) for C-C and C=C stretching vibration bands of canthaxanthin first increase and then decrease with the increase of pressure. We assume that the main mechanism of the RSCS values increasing can be attributed to the effect of steric hindrance. And the liquid-solid phase transition of carbon disulfide is occurred under the 0.5312 GPa, which lead to the decrease of RSCS values. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Phase stability and activity recovery of the Ni-Mg-Al catalyst were first compared with a catalyst prepared by impregnation method. It was found that the co-participated catalyst showed higher activity recoveries than the impregnated catalyst due to the stable Ni crystal size. Then, effects of SCWG variables including heating up rate, gasification temperature, catalyst loading amount and feedstock concentration, on the non-catalytic and catalytic gas yields and gasification efficiencies of glucose and phenol were evaluated. Results demonstrated that the presence of sufficient amount of Ni catalyst could realize complete carbon gasification of different organics, including phenol and real biomass. Catalyzed by Ni, CH4 was the more favored produced gas at 400-500 degrees C while H-2 yields were more abundant at 500-600 degrees C. Without catalyst, carbon gasification efficiencies of SCWG of different feedstock were in the order: glycerol > glucose > cellulose approximate to corncob approximate to poplar leaf approximate to sawdust > phenol, while those catalyzed by Ni were in the order: glycerol approximate to glucose approximate to cellulose approximate to phenol > corncob approximate to poplar leaf approximate to sawdust, illustrating that the co-precipitated Ni Mg Al catalyst is more active on catalyzing the gasification of water-soluble organics than real biomass.

Light regulates tropical symbiotic nitrogen fixation more strongly than soil nitrogen	NATURE PLANTS			English	Article							RICAN RAIN-FORESTS; DINITROGEN FIXATION; FIXING TREES; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; LIMITATION; GROWTH; SUCCESSION; STRATEGIES; ENRICHMENT; LEGUMES	Nitrogen limits primary production in almost every biome on Earth(1,2). Symbiotic nitrogen fixation, conducted by certain angiosperms and their endosymbiotic bacteria, is the largest potential natural source of new nitrogen into the biosphere3, influencing global primary production, carbon sequestration and element cycling. Because symbiotic nitrogen fixation represents an alternative to soil nitrogen uptake, much of the work on symbiotic nitrogen fixation regulation has focused on soil nitrogen availability(4-8). However, because symbiotic nitrogen fixation is an energetically expensive process(9), light availability to the plant may also regulate symbiotic nitrogen fixation rates(10,11). Despite the importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation to biosphere functioning, the environmental factors that most strongly regulate this process remain unresolved. Here we show that light regulates symbiotic nitrogen fixation more strongly than does soil nitrogen and that light mediates the response of symbiotic nitrogen fixation to soil nitrogen availability. In a shadehouse experiment, low light levels (comparable with forest understories) completely shut down symbiotic nitrogen fixation, whereas soil nitrogen levels that far exceeded plant demand did not fully downregulate symbiotic nitrogen fixation at high light. For in situ forest seedlings, light was a notable predictor of symbiotic nitrogen fixation activity, but soil-extractable nitrogen was not. Light as a primary regulator of symbiotic nitrogen fixation is a departure from decades of focus on soil nitrogen availability. This shift in our understanding of symbiotic nitrogen fixation regulation can resolve a long-standing biogeochemical paradox(12), and it will improve our ability to predict how symbiotic nitrogen fixation will fuel the global forest carbon sink and respond to human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle.

The transition temperature corresponding to the main or the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition (T(m)) is known for many bilayers of fully hydrated phosphatidylcholines. In this study, we have analyzed the T(m) values of 44 molecular species of phosphatidylcholines in terms of their structural and packing characteristics in the gel-state bilayer. Two general equations are thus derived: T(m) = 162.26 - 3651.71 (1/N) - 88.42 (DELTAC/N) for C(X):C(Y)PC with X greater-than-or-equal-to Y, and T(m) = 157.68 - 3525.44 (1/N) - 93.28 (DELTAC/N) for C(X):C(Y)PC with X < Y. Here, N is the minimal hydrophobic thickness of the dimeric C(X):C(Y)PC in the gel-state bilayer and DELTAC is the effective chain length difference between the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains for the monomeric C(X):C(Y)PC in the gel-state bilayer. The advantage of these two equations in predicting the T(m) values for phosphatidylcholines with DELTAC/CL values in the range of 0.07 to 0.40 is their simplicity. A figure containing a total of 173 calculated T(m) values is also presented.			HUANG, C (corresponding author), UNIV VIRGINIA,HLTH SCI CTR,DEPT BIOCHEM,BOX 440,CHARLOTTESVILLE,VA 22908, USA.

Directional massless Dirac fermions in a layered van der Waals material with one-dimensional long-range order	NATURE MATERIALS			English	Article							ELECTRONIC BAND-STRUCTURE; MONOLAYER; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; FERROMAGNETISM; CONDUCTION; DISCOVERY	One or a few layers of van der Waals (vdW) materials are promising for applications in nanoscale electronics. Established properties include high mobility in graphene, a large direct gap in monolayer MoS2, the quantum spin Hall effect in monolayer WTe2 and so on. These exciting properties arise from electron quantum confinement in the two-dimensional limit. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal directional massless Dirac fermions due to one-dimensional confinement of carriers in the layered vdW material NbSi0.45Te2. The one-dimensional directional massless Dirac fermions are protected by non-symmorphic symmetry, and emerge from a stripe-like structural modulation with long-range translational symmetry only along the stripe direction as we show using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Our work not only provides a playground for investigating further the properties of directional massless Dirac fermions, but also introduces a unique component with one-dimensional long-range order for engineering nano-electronic devices based on heterostructures of vdW materials.

Regioselectivity and equilibrium thermodynamics for addition of Rh-OH to olefins in water	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SOLUBLE ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS; ANTI-MARKOVNIKOV HYDROAMINATION; AEROBIC OXIDATIVE AMINATION; CATALYTIC-HYDROGENATION; INTERMOLECULAR HYDROAMINATION; RUTHENIUM ALKYLIDENES; DISSOCIATION-CONSTANT; DEUTERIUM-OXIDE; ALDEHYDES; ALKENES	Rhodium(III) tetra(p-sulfonato phenyl) porphyrin ((TSPP)Rh) aquo and hydroxo complexes react with a series of olefins in water to form beta-hydroxyalkyl complexes. Addition reactions of (TSPP)Rh-OH to unactivated terminal alkenes invariably occur with both kinetic and thermodynamic preferences to place rhodium on the terminal carbon to form (TSPP)Rh-CH2CH(OH)R complexes. Acrylic and styrenic olefins initially react to place rhodium on the terminal carbon to form Rh-CH2CH(OH)X as the kinetically preferred isomer but subsequently proceed to an equilibrium distribution of regioisomers where Rh-CH(CH2OH)X is the predominant thermodynamic product. Equilibrium constants for reactions of the diaquo rhodium(III) compound ([(TSPP)Rh-III(H2O)2](-3)) in water with a series of terminal olefins that form beta-hydroxyalkyl complexes were directly evaluated and used in deriving thermodynamic values for addition of the Rh-OH unit to olefins. The Delta G degrees for reactions of the Rh-OH unit with olefins in water is approximately 3 kcal mol(-1) less favorable than the comparable Rh-H reactions in water. Comparisons of the regioisomers and thermodynamics for addition reactions of olefins with Rh-H and Rh-OH units in water are presented and discussed.

However, elevating the working temperature can also restrain the adsorption of effective gas and may improve the adsorbent performance. Temperature variation is demonstrated to be a way to regulate the adsorbent performance. In this study, a coal-based activated carbon was synthesized and characterized. The CO2 and H-2 adsorption capacities are inversely associated with the adsorption temperature, and a larger adsorption heat does not mean a higher adsorption capacity. Although the CO2 adsorption capacity is much higher than that of H-2, sometimes the H-2 adsorption capacity is more sensitive to the temperature. The adsorption selectivity for CO, over H-2 improves when the temperature rises from 298 to 353 K A four-bed pressure swing adsorption (PSA) model was developed on the basis of an on-site pilot-scale PSA apparatus to determine the practical separation performance of adsorbents under different working conditions. The simulation results showed that, when the product gas purity is the same, the recovery rate at 353 K is approximately 2% higher than that at 298 K, indicating that the improvement in adsorption selectivity can make up for the declining adsorption capacity. More importantly, the improvement in gas recovery implies a higher energy efficiency or higher productivity. This phenomenon also exists in some other adsorbents reported before, including chemical adsorbents and composite adsorbents.

Here, we investigated the natural isotopic abundances (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of the soil in healthy and degraded alpine ecosystems, including alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and alpine desert on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We also examined the effects of plant factors and soil chemical and physical factors on the soil delta C-13 and delta N-15 in these alpine ecosystems of the QTP. The results indicated that the soil delta C-13 and delta N-15 varied significantly with the grassland type, the land degradation, and soil depth. The C4-plant dominated alpine desert was much higher in the soil delta C-13 and delta N-15 than the C3-plant dominated alpine meadow and alpine steppe. Along the soil depth of 0 to 30 cm, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 were enriched in all types of the alpine ecosystems. The land degradation lowered the plant cover, aboveground plant biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (TN) in all alpine ecosystems. Land degradation enriched the soil delta C-13 in the alpine steppe and the soil delta N-15 in alpine desert by changing their interactions with the plant and soil features.

Partition and non-partition transition of austenite growth from a ferrite and cementite mixture in hypo- and hypereutectoid Fe-C-Mn alloys	CALPHAD-COMPUTER COUPLING OF PHASE DIAGRAMS AND THERMOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Austenitization; Ferrite; Cementite; Alloy element partitioning; Manganese steel	DUAL-PHASE STEELS; PEARLITE TRANSFORMATION; DISSOLUTION; MANGANESE; KINETICS; ELEMENTS	The growth of austenite from a ferrite and cementite mixture in low Mn steel of hypo- and hypereutectoid composition is investigated with focus upon the Mn partitioning between dissolving cementite (or ferrite) and austenite. Under the assumption that austenite is nucleated on cementite, two critical temperatures which characterize the transition between Mn-partitioned and non-partitioned growth of austenite are noticed; below the 1st and lower critical temperature the austenite grows with redistribution of Mn from the beginning, and above the 2nd and higher critical temperature, without Mn redistribution until completion. Between them the growth mode switches from carbon-diffusion to Mn-diffusion control during growth. The influence of carbon and/or Mn diffusion through the matrix becomes progressively more significant with time, but may not affect the growth mode transition temperatures. Above the 2nd critical temperature, which is at most ca. 50 degrees C higher than Acm or Ae(3) in alloys studied, the distribution of Mn in as-transformed or spheroidized pearlite is preserved at the completion of austenitization irrespective of the last dissolving phase, leading to the formation of an ultrafine mixture of martensite and austenite upon quenching.

In this work, we demonstrate an efficient diethylene glycol (DEG) reduction method for the synthesis of a Pd/C catalyst with high dispersion and small particle size. During the synthesis, no surfactants and halogen ions are introduced in the reaction system, and DEG efficiently acts as solvent and reducing agent, which results in a "clean'' Pd surface. Meanwhile, compared to the classic ethylene glycol (EG) reduction method, the present DEG reduction method can produce the high-quality Pd/C composites. As a result, the as-prepared Pd/C electrocatalyst exhibits a large electrochemical active surface area and good electrocatalytic performance for the methanol oxidation reaction in an alkaline media, due to the high dispersion and small particle size. This result indicates the as-prepared Pd/C electrocatalyst has potential applications in alkaline direct methanol fuel cells.	[Zhai, Y. N.; He, S.; Wu, Z. Q.; Li, S.

The gas temperature, components and fly ash in the near-burner region and furnace center were sampled and measured. It shows that the pulverized-coal concentration variation in the primary air duct is of great importance as for defining the flame structure, gas temperature profile and gas components. With the burner changing from general type to inner-lean-outer-rich to inner-rich-outer-lean types I and II, the flame diffusion zone shrinks, its color less bright, the O-2 concentration in the flame zone decreases and the CO concentration increases significantly. Additionally, the NO concentration decreases, with NOx emissions at the furnace exit dropping from 1182 to 861 mg/m(3) (a reduction of 27.15%). Finally, the release rates of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen and the burnout rate of carbon all decrease.

J	Li, S; Zhu, C; Guo, SM; Guo, LJ				Li, Sha; Zhu, Chao; Guo, Simao; Guo, Liejin			A dispersed rutile-TiO2-supported Ni nanoparticle for enhanced gas production from catalytic hydrothermal gasification of glucose	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							SUPERCRITICAL WATER GASIFICATION; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; BIOMASS GASIFICATION; NICKEL-CATALYSTS; CRYSTAL SIZE; CELLULOSE; ENERGY; TIO2	Hydrothermal gasification (HTG) is a promising technique for the utilization of wet biomass or organic wastes. This study reports a highly dispersed rutile-TiO2-supported Ni nanoparticle synthesized by a sol-gel method and its catalytic performance for gas production (H-2 and CH4) from HTG of glucose as a model compound of biomass. NiTiO3 formation of the gel precursor during the calcination process demonstrated the enhanced interaction of Ni and TiO2, and highly dispersive nickel crystallites were obtained after the reduction activation. Increase of the calcination temperature decreased the catalytic activity due to the sintering of nickel crystals. The supported Ni nanoparticle greatly promoted the carbon gasification efficiency of HTG of 10 wt% glucose (glucose : Ni = 1 : 0.11) from 27.1% to 68.7% at 400 degrees C and from 48.2% to 96.4% at 600 degrees C in supercritical water. A highly active temperature region (400-500 degrees C) of nickel catalyzed methanation reaction for CH4 formation was particularly confirmed. As the gasification was prolonged in supercritical water, the rutile-TiO2-supported Ni nanoparticle showed stable crystalline structures and part of the deposited carbon was gasified. The regenerated catalysts also showed significant activities.

The comparative test indicated that the final composite catalyst had higher catalytic activity than other semi-finished catalysts. Furthermore, the role of beta-CD, MWCNT and Fe3O4 in the composite catalyst was studied. Based on this, the enhancement effect was confirmed and a reasonable reaction process was proposed. The effects of reaction parameters including pH, dosage of the catalyst, initial H2O2 concentration and temperature on the TBBPA degradation were also evaluated. The Fe3O4@beta-CD/MWCNT possessed an outstanding catalytic performance with about 97% removal rate of TBBPA under the optimum condition. In addition, the excellent stability and anti-interference of Fe3O4@beta-CD/MWCNT were justified. Meanwhile, on the basis of LC-MS analysis and the detection of bromine ions, a possible degradation pathway for TBBPA was proposed.

Study of partition to non-partition transition of austenite growth along pearlite lamellae in near-eutectoid Fe-C-Mn alloy	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Austenitization; Pearlite; Alloy element partition; Local equilibrium; Low alloy steel	COOPERATIVE GROWTH; KINETICS; FERRITE; DIFFUSION; TRANSFORMATION; DISSOLUTION; SIMULATION; CEMENTITE; ELEMENTS; STEEL	The austenite formation from lamellar pearlite was studied in a near-eutectoid Fe-0.6mass%C-2mass%Mn alloy with focus on the transition between partitioned and non-partitioned growth of austenite. The austenite was nucleated at pearlite colony boundaries and grew along the lamellae of pearlite. The isothermal austenite transformation curves revealed that the transition from slow to fast growth of austenite occurred over a narrow temperature range (720-725 degrees C). The ghost pearlite which had formed above the transition temperature transformed to a very fine mixture of martensite (previously pearlitic ferrite) and austenite (pearlitic cementite) upon cooling to room temperature. According to thermodynamic analysis which takes into account carbon transport from theta/alpha and theta/gamma interfaces toward gamma/alpha interfaces the transition temperature appears to be closer to experiment and significantly (ca. 20 degrees C) lower than that previously proposed assuming that the austenite was nucleated at the theta/alpha interface. Phase field simulation of the carbon and Mn distributions around the tip of a cementite lamella also seems to indicate the change of diffusivity which plays a leading role in the growth of austenite.

The aim of this paper is to build a production prediction model based on machine learning technique and identify the most important factor for production. Firstly, around 159 horizontal wells were collected, targeting the Duvernay Formation with detailed geological and completion records. Secondly, the key factors were selected using grey relation analysis and Pearson correlation. Then, three statistical models were built through multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), gaussian process regression (GPR). The model inputs include fluid volume, proppant amount, cluster counts, stage counts, total horizontal lateral length, gas saturation, total organic carbon content, condensate-gas ratio. The model performance was assessed by root mean squared errors (RMSE) and R-squared value. Finally, sensitivity analysis was applied based on best performance model. The analysis shows following conclusions: (1) GPR model shows the best performance with the highest R-squared value and the lowest RMSE. In the testing set, the model shows a R-squared of 0.8 with a RMSE of 280.54 x 10(4) m(3) in the prediction of cumulative gas production within 1st 6 producing months and gives a R-squared of 0.83 with a RMSE of 1884.3 t in the prediction of cumulative oil production within 1st 6 producing months (2) Sensitivity analysis based on GPR model indicates that condensate-gas ratio, fluid volume, and total organic carbon content are the most important features to cumulative oil production within 1st 6 producing months. Fluid volume, Stages, and total organic carbon content are the most significant factors to cumulative gas production within 1st 6 producing months. The analysis progress and results developed in this study will assist companies to build prediction models and figure out which factors control well performance.

Impact of atmospheric ammonia on growth, C and N accumulation and photosynthesis of two maize cultivars with different N root supply	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						atmospheric ammonia enrichment; dry matter; carbon accumulation; nitrogen accumulation; photosynthetic characteristic	WINTER-WHEAT; NH3; DEPOSITION; VEGETATION; LEAVES	Impact of enriched atmospheric NH3 in combination with low and high N medium on growth, total C and N accumulation (C(tot)A and N(tot)A) and photosynthetic characteristics of two maize cultivars i.e. SD19 (cult. 1) and NE5 (cult. 2) with low N and N high use efficiency, respectively, was investigated. Plants were exposed to 10 nl/L and 1000 nl/L NH3 fumigation, respectively, for 30 days in open-top chambers (OTCs). Under exposure to the low N medium, increase of the atmospheric NH3 concentration to 1000 nl/L from the ambient level significantly (P < 0.05) increased dry matter (DM) (by 18% in cult. 1 and 14% in cult. 2 respectively), C(tot)A, N(tot)A, net photosynthetic rate (P-n), stomatal conductance (G(s)) and apparent quantum yield (AQY) but decreased intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) in both cultivars. These effects were more pronounced in cult. 1 as compared to those in cult. 2. In contrast, in the high N solution, enriched atmospheric NH3 led to a decrease in DM, C(tot)A, N(tot)A, P-n, G(s) and AQY but an increase in C-i of cult. 2 only. Dark respiration rate remained unaffected by enrichment of NH3 in each treatment. Therefore, it is concluded that appropriately enriched atmospheric NH3 can improve plant growth of maize by enhancing C(tot)A, N(tot)A, and photosynthesis in the low N medium, especially for low N use efficiency cultivars.

Several studies have recently shown that the addition of substantial quantities (hundreds to thousands ppm) of water and weak acids to dimethoxyethane (DME)-based electrolytes can significantly increase Li-O-2 battery discharge capacity, without substantially changing the discharge product chemistry, which remains Li2O2. The exact mechanisms behind these device-level improvements, however, are not yet understood. In this study, we show that the presence of water in a DME-based electrolyte decreases the rate of Li2O2 nucleation on the electrode surface during Li-O-2 battery discharge, using potentiostatic electrochemical measurements, and direct, ex situ observations of Li2O2 particles. We also show that adding water to an acetonitrile (MeCN)-based electrolyte results in LiOH upon discharge, as opposed to only Li2O2. Using first principles calculations, we propose that this change in discharge product chemistry is attributable to increased proton availability, as shown by a lower pK(a) for water in MeCN than in DME. This study combines kinetic and morphological analyses with first principles calculations, and elucidates relationships among electrolyte composition, discharge product chemistry and growth mechanisms for the rational design of efficient metal-air batteries.

Such modification was realized by grafting with alkanols of different chain lengths (hexanol, dodecanol and octadecanol) on the surface of starch-based films. The grafting of alkanol increased the mobility of glycerol as the plasticizer within the film surface. Also, this grafting increased the mass ratio of carbon to oxygen on the film surface but reduced the mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen. Under the same reaction conditions, there were fewer dodecyl chains grafted onto the film surface than hexyl or octadecyl chains. Furthermore, the results revealed that the surface hydrophobicity of starch-based films could be enhanced by simply increasing the alkyl chain length. Also, fewer alkyl chains tended to reduce the surface hydrophobicity of the films. These results are valuable for the rational design of starch-based materials with demanded hydrophobic properties.

In this study, we investigated associations between management practice intensities (nutrient-herbicide, nutrient-mowing and manure-mowing), environmental factors including plant coverage, pH, exchangeable calcium (Ca2+), aluminium ion (Al3+), total organic carbon (TOC), C to N ratio (C/N) and soil moisture (SM), and microbial community structure in Chinese hickory (Catya cathayenses) plantations cultivated on two soil types (calcareous and yellow soils). Our results demonstrated that long-term management practices with different intensities significantly changed certain soil environmental factors, and revealed a significant impact on both alpha and beta-diversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities. Specifically, significant higher values of plant coverage, pH, Ca2+, TOC, C/N and SM and lower value of Al3+ were observed under manure-mowing management. Calcareous soil showed significantly higher pH, Ca2+ and TN contents and lower AP values than yellow soil across all three operating intensities. The bacterial community structure was different between the calcareous and yellow soil, but there was no difference for the fungi. Edaphic properties such as pH, Ca2+, TOC and TN were shown to play crucial roles in microbial community structuring, while vegetation-associated factors (vegetation coverage and Al3+) were correlated with fungal community structure. The complexity of microbe co-occurrence network decreased as management practice intensified. The keystone taxa including Bradyrhizobium, Reyranella and Phaselicystis in bacterial network and Rhizophydium and Microascales in fungal network were only observed under manure-mowing, with ecological functions mainly involved in organic carbon degradation and nitrogen fixation. Our results provide insight into the interactions between management practice intensities and soil microbial community characteristics and have implications for the optimization of sustainable forestry management practices and maintenance of microbial diversity and network complexity in over-managed forest plantations.

Improvements in the efficiency of nitrogen use of crops are therefore essential; however, they require an in-depth understanding of the co-regulatory mechanisms that integrate growth, nitrogen assimilation and carbon fixation. Here we show that the balanced opposing activities and physical interactions of the rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR 4 (GRF4) transcription factor and the growth inhibitor DELLA confer homeostatic co-regulation of growth and the metabolism of carbon and nitrogen. GRF4 promotes and integrates nitrogen assimilation, carbon fixation and growth, whereas DELLA inhibits these processes. As a consequence, the accumulation of DELLA that is characteristic of green revolution varieties confers not only yield-enhancing dwarfism, but also reduces the efficiency of nitrogen use. However, the nitrogen-use efficiency of green revolution varieties and grain yield are increased by tipping the GRF4-DELLA balance towards increased GRF4 abundance. Modulation of plant growth and metabolic co-regulation thus enables novel breeding strategies for future sustainable food security and a new green revolution.

Herein, we propose a promising electrodissolution-coupled Hf(OR)(4) synthesis (EHS) system for green and efficient electrosynthesis of Hf(OR)(4). The operational principle of the electrically driven system consists of two simultaneous heterogeneous reactions of Hf dissolution and alcohol dehydrogenation, plus a spontaneous solution-based combination reaction. In applying ethanol as solvent and Hf metal as electrodissolution medium, we achieved waste-free production of high-purity hafnium ethoxide [Hf(OEt)(4)] with an equivalent "a concomitant" reduction in CO2 emission of 187.33 g CO2 per kg Hf(OEt)(4) and a high net profit of 30 477 USD per kg Hf(OEt)(4). This system is very competitive with the thermal process, which unavoidably releases substantial waste and CO2 for a net profit of 27 700 USD per kg Hf(OEt)(4). We anticipate that the environmental and economic benefits of the EHS process could pave the way for its practical application.

The diets of a dominant mangrove crab, Parasesarma plicata, in two mangrove habitats (Kandelia obovata forest and Avicennia marina forest) and adjacent S. alterniflora marsh in a subtropical mangrove estuary in Fujian, China, were investigated using stable isotopes, while a feeding experiment was carried out. The results showed that in the Avicennia forest, Parasesarma was herbivorous, feeding mainly on macroalgae. In the Kandelia forest, the contribution of mangrove leaves, macroalgae, and sediment to the diet of Parasesarma were about 75.5%, 24.2%, and 0.2%, respectively. While Parasesarma had a higher delta C-13 value and also a higher delta N-15 value in the Spartina marshes relative to the two mangrove habitats, suggesting that they were feeding on Spartina detritus as well as some small invertebrates. The feeding experiment showed that the delta C-13 value of Parasesarma after 90-day feeding only on Spartina leaves was very close to the delta C-13 value of the crab caught from the Spartina marshes, indicating that Spartina was the main carbon source. These results demonstrated that the invasion of Spartina has changed the main food resources of native crabs by providing food resources, which could affect the impact of crabs as ecological engineers and eventually affect the integrity and function of native ecosystems.

Our approach is based on a fast and inexpensive thiol-ene free radical addition that can be applied for different classes of preceramic polymers with carbon-carbon double bonds. Due to the rapidity and efficiency of the thiol-ene click reactions, this additive manufacturing process can be effectively carried out using conventional light sources on benchtop printers. Through light initiated cross-linking, the liquid preceramic polymers transform into stable infusible thermosets that preserve their shape during the polymer-to-ceramic transformation. Through pyrolysis the thermosets transform into glassy ceramics with uniform shrinkage and high density. The obtained ceramic structures are nearly fully dense, have smooth surfaces, and are free from macroscopic voids and defects. A fabricated SiOC honeycomb was shown to exhibit a significantly higher compressive strength to weight ratio in comparison to other porous ceramics.

A new unicellular species was extracted from China farmland, and the strain could produce VB12 which was identified by HPLC and HPLC-MS/MS. 16S rDNA analysis reveals this strain belongs to the species Sinorhizobium meliloti and we named it S. meliloti 320. Its whole genome information indicates that this strain has a complete VB12 synthetic pathway, which paves the way for further metabolic engineering studies. The optimal carbon and nitrogen sources are sucrose and corn steep liquor (CSL) plus peptone. The optimal combination of sucrose and CSL was obtained by response surface methodology as they are the most suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. This strain could produce 140 +/- 4.2 mg L-1 vitamin B-12 after incubating for 7 days in the optimal medium.

In this paper, we perform a 1465 h in situ durability test with a single fuel cell operating at a constant-current of 800mA cm(-2). Polarization curves, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used for diagnostics and to understand changes in performance during the test. Limiting current method is used to analyze the oxygen transport resistance of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) before and after durability test. The results indicate that the oxygen transport resistance in single cell increases greatly, and GDL is the first component leading to fuel cell failure after 1465h test. At 150 kPa and 20% dry oxygen mole fraction, the limiting current decreases to about 700mA cm(-2) and total oxygen transport resistance increases by 0.1623s cm(-1), implying more serious flooding occurs in GDL after the 1465 h durability test. The increase of oxygen transport resistances of the substrate and micro porous layer of GDL confirm the loss of water management capability of GDL. SEM images show that these may be caused by oxidation of carbon and loss of polytetrafluoroethylene in GDL. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

In this work, we developed a hybrid material of palladium nanoparticles and nickel single-atom catalysts (Pd NPs@Ni SAC) for efficient EOR. The Pd nanoparticles catalyze the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds of ethanol, while the adsorbed CO intermediates are removed by the Ni single-atom catalyst. The Pd NPs@Ni SAC structure exhibits outstanding EOR performances, including high mass activity, good selectivities of C-1 products, and excellent electrocatalytic stability. Our work suggests an attractive perspective of utilizing single-atom electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation.

The cover crops were grown in winter or summer fallow seasons. Results showed that all cover crops affected the cucumber growth, soil phenolics content and changed the soil microbial communities. Cucumber yield and dry matter in Welsh onion and Mustard cover crop rotations were significantly higher. Mustard crop increased the soil fungal community diversity indices, while the Welsh onion crop rotation decreased it. Further, with an increase in planting seasons, soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) increased in the cover crop systems. Compared with Welsh onion and mustard cover crop rotations, wheat crop rotation had lower Fusarium population for long term and improved the cucumber yield. Welsh onion and mustard cover crop rotaions had short-term effects, while wheat cover crop rotation had a long-term effects on cucumber growth.	[Li, M. Q.; Li, S.; Zhou, X. G.; Li, M.; Wu, F.

The CF-SiO2 hybrid as a reinforcement possessed lubricating and reinforcing effect to enhance tribological performance, thermal stability and thermomechanical property of epoxy (EP) composites. The micro-nano synergetic structure was of great importance for ameliorating the compatibility and interfacial adhesion between CF and EP matrix, which was conductive to transferring stress from matrix to fiber and alleviating stress concentration. It was concluded that the friction coefficient and wear rate of EP/CF-SiO2 were 0.382 and 1.12 x 10(-5) mm(3)/N center dot m, that is, a decline of 58% and 2.5 times, respectively, compared to EP/CF.

J	Li, S; Ji, XZ; Zhang, XS; Gao, L; Jin, HG				Li, Sheng; Ji, Xiaozhou; Zhang, Xiaosong; Gao, Lin; Jin, Hongguang			Coal to SNG: Technical progress, modeling and system optimization through exergy analysis	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Synthetic natural gas; Coal gasification; Modeling and simulation; Exergy analysis	SYNTHETIC-NATURAL-GAS; CARBON-MONOXIDE; METHANATION; CATALYSTS; ENERGY; GASIFICATION; BIOMASS; STREAM; SECTOR; POWER	For both energy security and CO2 emission reduction, synthetic natural gas (SNG) production from coal is an important path to implement clean coal technologies in China. In this paper, an overview of the progress of coal to SNG technologies, including the development of catalysts, reactor designs, synthesis processes, and systems integration, is provided. The coal to SNG system is modeled, the coupling between SNG production and power generation is investigated, the breakthrough points for further energy savings are determined, and the system performance is optimized based on the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. From the viewpoint of the first law of thermodynamics, the energy conversion efficiency of coal to SNG system can reach 59.8%. To reduce the plant auxiliary power, the breakthrough points are the development of low-energy-consumption oxygen production technology and gas purification technology or seeking new oxidants for coal gasification instead of oxygen. From the viewpoint of the second law of thermodynamics, the major exergy destruction in a coal to SNG system occurs in the coal gasification unit, SNG synthesis unit and the raw syngas cooling process. How to reduce the exergy destruction in these units is the key to energy savings and system performance enhancement. The conversion ratio of the first SNG synthesis reactor and the split ratio of the recycle gas are key factors that determine the performance of both the SNG synthesis process and the whole plant. A "turning point" phenomenon is observed: when the split ratio is higher than 0.90, the exergy destruction of the SNG synthesis process will increase sharply, which causes a decrease in overall system efficiency. Keeping the conversion ratio of the first synthesis reaction between 0.78 and 0.90 not only avoids the rapid increase of exergy destruction in the SNG synthesis process but also produces the SNG product with a high CH4 purity (>94.0%), and the catalyst can be maintained with a high activity. When the split ratio of the recycle gas is approximately 0.85, the best coupling/balance between SNG production and power generation can be attained and thus the highest overall system efficiency of approximately 62% is achieved, much higher than approximately 55% efficiency in a traditional coal to SNG plant. The findings presented in this paper are important steps for future improvements of coal to SNG systems, especially the SNG and power cogeneration systems, integration in the future.

The geometries and energies of all stationary points involved in the reaction are calculated at the UB3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level. And the more accurate energy information is provided by single point calculations at the UCCSD(T)/6-311++G(2d,2p) level. Relationships of the reactants, transition states, intermediates, and products are confirmed by the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations. Our calculations demonstrate that this reaction is most likely initiated by carbon-to-olefinic carbon attack manners. The results suggest that P1 (C2H3 + CO) is the most important product through two competitive channels R -> IM1 -> TS1/P1 -> P1 (C2H3 + CO) and R -> IM1 -> TS1/6 -> IM6 -> TS6/P1 -> P1 (C2H3 + CO). This study presents highlights of the mechanism of the title reaction, which is in good agreement with experimental results.

For efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting, active, robust, and cost-effective catalysts are highly desired. Here, we present a facile approach to fabricate 1T-phase dominant V-doped MoS2 nanosheets which can be easily grown on carbon paper at a large scale. The 5 at.% V-doped MoS2 nanosheets achieve excellent catalytic performance, showing more than 10-fold increase of current density compared with 2H MoS2 and a surprisingly low onset potential of 102 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Moreover, it exhibits good catalytical stability in both acidic and alkaline solutions. The remarkable HER performance mainly attributes to the synergistic effects of the modified structure of MoS2 with enhanced active sites, increased electrical conductivity, optimised energy level and near-zero Gibbs free energy of hydrogen binding. This work may shed light on achieving highly efficient electrocatalysts toward practical applications.

In this respect, the exploration of advanced host materials to regulate the behavior of Li plating/stripping is an effective strategy to resolve those issues. In this work, we report the modified Ni foam by Au nanoparticles decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as effective Li host (denoted as Au@rGONi). Thus-prepared Li host enabled a stable CE as high as 96.5% after 100 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2) with a capacity of 1 mAh cm(-2). The according symmetric cell delivered a long-term lifespan of 1000 h without obvious voltage fluctuation under 0.5 mA cm(-2)/1 mAh cm(-2). More encouragingly, a full LIB based on the Au@rGONi-300 anode and LiFeO4 cathode demonstrated excellent discharge-charge cycling behavior with a high capacity of 130.5 mAh g(-1) after 140 cycles at 0.2C. This work presents the feasibility to develop stable lithium metal anodes by surface modification of commercial Ni foam with lithiophilic materials.

In this work, a commercial Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense SCUT27/Delta ldh-G58 was successfully isolated via sequential batch fermentation with step-increased carbon concentrations. Mutants were isolated under selective high osmotic pressures for 58 passages. The evolved isolate rapidly catabolized sugars at high concentrations and subsequently produced ethanol with good yield. A 1.6-fold improvement of ethanol production was achieved in a medium containing 120 g/L of carbon substrate using the evolved strain, compared to the start strain. The analysis of transcriptome and intracellular solute pools suggested that the adaptive evolution altered the synthesis of some compatible solutes and activated the DNA repair system in the two Thermoanaerobacterium sp. evolved strains. Overall, the results indicated the potential of adaptive evolution as a simple and effective tool for the modification and optimization of industrial microorganisms.

In 2004, cgPN was first synthesized from nitrogen gas under extremely high temperature and high pressure conditions and the trace amount of cgPN in the high-pressure vessel decomposed once the pressure was released. Until recently, our group for the first time synthesized cgPN from an NaN3 precursor under ambient conditions with radio-frequency plasma. Here, synthesis and stabilization of cgPN are systematically investigated both computationally and experimentally. The effects of several major factors are studied, and the possible key intermediate is explored. In addition to NaN3, a ZEZ N8 precursor is also used. ZEZ N8 was synthesized by the cyclic voltammetry method. EZE N8 is found to be the potential intermediate for cgPN formation based on the Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectra and the fact that a higher yield of cgPN is obtained with the ZEZ N8 precursor. Na+ is shown to stabilize cgPN under ambient conditions; however, an excess of Na+ has a negative effect on cgPN growth. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was carried out using cgPN as the cathodic catalyst, and the result shows that it is very active for the ORR, which is comparable with a commercial Pt/carbon catalyst. Moreover, cgPN shows an excellent stability during the ORR. This work guides the rational synthesis and scaleup of cgPN and its practical applications for the ORR.

NOV.; DIVERSITY; MOISTURE; AFFORESTATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; CHINA	Vegetation restoration has been widely used in karst rocky desertification (KRD) areas of southwestern China, but the response of microbial community to revegetation has not been well characterized. We investigated the diversity, structure, and co-occurrence patterns of bacterial communities in soils of five vegetation types (grassland, shrubbery, secondary forest, pure plantation and mixed plantation) in KRD area using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis revealed that 15 bacterial community samples were clustered into five groups that corresponded very well to the five vegetation types. Shannon diversity was positively correlated with pH and Ca2+ content but negatively correlated with organic carbon, total nitrogen, and soil moisture. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil pH, Ca2+ content, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and soil moisture jointly influenced bacterial community structure. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed non-random assembly patterns of bacterial composition in the soils. Bryobacter, GR-WP33-30, and Rhizomicrobium were identified as keystone genera in co-occurrence network. These results indicate that diverse soil physicochemical properties and potential interactions among taxa during vegetation restoration may jointly affect the bacterial community structure in KRD regions.

Due to concentration gradient soluble polysulphides easily diffuse/migrate out from cathode composite forming non-uniform distribution of the sulphur within cathode. Eventually polysulphides can be completely reduced on the metallic lithium anode. In this work we compare the sorption properties of manganese modified zeolite silicalite-1 (MnS-1) with a cathode composite containing SBA-15 additive and a cathode composite without additive. Careful analysis using XPS and FIB microscopy equipped with EDX show improved retention of polysulphide species within cathode composite in the case of MnS-1 zeolite as an additive. Interestingly, the amount of sulphur species detected by XPS on the metallic lithium is very similar regardless on cathode composite we use. Finally, similar cycling behaviour can be observed if MnS-1 zeolite is used as an interlayer between composite cathode and separator. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Germany has embraced Energiewende, a bold sustainable energy policy of no operational nuclear plants by 2022. California has set an ambitious goal that mandates 50% renewable penetration by 2025, 60% by 2030, and 100% by 2045 [1]. The vast integration of renewable energy into the power grid imposes daunting challenges on the conventional supply-side control paradigm. First, renewable energy is intermittent and uncertain. Integrating renewable energy will reduce the system inertia, inject undesirable variability, and substantially increase the need for system reserves. These reserves are typically provided by conventional generators. However, conventional generators have limited capacity and ramping rate, and they produce carbon emissions that defeat the carbon benefit of renewable integration. On the other hand, the increasing penetration of renewable energy also squeezes the response time needed to balance the power grid. That is, the time required to make critical operating decisions is decreasing from minutes to seconds and, in some cases, even subseconds due to the increasing variability of supply and demand. The shorter response time for decision making places significant challenges on the conventional power grid, which requires human interaction.

The Mn-promoted hollow CaCO3 microspheres with self-supported double shells effectively handled the collapsing problem led by the continuous volume variations, of which the adsorption performance notably outperformed that of the pure CaCO3 counterpart. The uniformly distributed Mn considerably enhanced structural stability of the double-shelled hollow microspheres and reduced the crystalline size of CaCO3. Furthermore, the existence of Mn promoted the ability of donating electrons of CaO to CO2 and was presumably to bring about oxygen vacancies. The sorbent Ca12Mn1-500 exhibited an initial CO2 adsorption capacity of 0.62 g-CO2/g-ads and a final one of 0.53 g-CO2/g-ads after 25 adsorption-desorption cycles.

Thiol-promoted catalytic synthesis of high-performance furan-containing lubricant base oils from biomass derived 2-alkylfurans and ketones	GREEN CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CARBOXYLIC-ACIDS; DIESEL; FUELS; HYDROGENOLYSIS; HEMICELLULOSE; FERMENTATION; ALKYLATION; CONVERSION; CHEMICALS; CELLULOSE	About 97% of lubricant base oils are currently sourced from petroleum and the majority of the rest is produced from vegetable oils. We demonstrate a promising catalytic route to produce base oils from lignocellulosic biomass-derived 2-alkylfurans and ketones via carbon-carbon coupling in neat conditions. Among several homogeneous and heterogeneous acid catalysts tested, a perfluorinated sulfonic acid (Aquivion PW79S) exhibits the best catalytic performance and yields up to 90% renewable furan-containing base oils with the use of a thiol promotor. The effects of the acid strength of the catalysts, molecular size and structure of thiols and ketones, and fraction of thiols are studied. Electronic structure calculations elucidate the reaction pathway and indicate that the thiol reduces the barrier of the rate-determining dehydration step.

Early in the deployment, surface pCO(2) decreased by similar to 117atm in a single day (11-12 September, from an initial value of similar to 527atm); a similar decline of 62atm occurred five days later (to similar to 378atm). Both drawdown events were associated with strong vertical stratification, high chlorophyll a concentrations, and oxygen supersaturation. A one-dimensional mass balance model suggests that biological production was responsible for more than half the pCO(2) decrease observed during 10-23 September. Subsequently, in association with strong winds, the mixed layer rapidly deepened and surface pCO(2) increased sharply (by about 108atm in late September and again in early October). Vertical mixing accounted for more than half of this pCO(2) increase, which offset more than the earlier biologically driven CO2 drawdown. In the presence of such strong temporal variations of pCO(2), sampling frequency exerts a substantial influence on air-sea CO2 flux calculations for the Changjiang River plume and similar coastal areas. Compared to daily sampling, even weekly sampling would result in a bias of up to 4.7mmolCm(-2)day(-1) or 63% error. Plain Language Summary Determining the mechanisms that control sea surface pCO(2) and its variability in coastal waters is an important step toward estimating global air-sea CO2 fluxes and projecting future atmospheric CO2 levels. In this study, a 31-day high-resolution buoy time series from the surface ocean of the Changjiang River plume in early autumn 2013 show great variability in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and other parameters. Early in the deployment, surface pCO(2) decreased sharply in short period (one to five days). The pCO(2) drawdown events were associated with strong vertical stratification, high chlorophyll a concentrations, and oxygen supersaturation. A mass balance model suggests that biological production was responsible for more than half the pCO(2) decrease observed. Subsequently, in association with strong northeast winds, the mixed layer rapidly deepened and surface pCO(2) increased sharply. Vertical mixing accounted for more than half of this pCO(2) increase. In the presence of such strong temporal variations of pCO(2), sampling frequency exerts a substantial influence on air-sea CO2 flux calculations for the Changjiang River plume and similar coastal areas.

J	Mitrasinovic, PM				Mitrasinovic, PM			Electron delocalization in atomic and molecular systems	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							COVALENT BOND ORDERS; SHELL STRUCTURE; TOPOLOGICAL THEORY; BASIS-SETS; DENSITY; INDEXES; LOCALIZATION; LAPLACIAN; FERMI; HOLE	Electron delocalization in atomic and molecular systems in terms of the single particle delocalization index (Fulton, R. L. J. Phys. Chem. 1993, 97, 7516) is analyzed. The single particle delocalization index is a quantitative measure of the degree of sharing of an electron between two disjoint regions in a many electron system. The overall focus of this paper is the determination of spatial regions in atoms from which electrons are greatly delocalized. The delocalization indices from spherical volumes of various radii centered on the nucleus of interest to the volumes outside those regions show remarkably well-defined shell structure. The delocalization shell structure exhibits spatial regions in atoms, determined by the intershell. minima, in which electrons are essentially localized. The delocalization shell structure of the electrons is apparent in all the atoms in the last column, of the periodic table of the elements (Ne S-1(0), Ar S-1(0), Kr S-1(0), Xe S-1(0), and Rn S-1(0)), even in heavy atoms such as gold (Au S-2(1/2)) where by traditional methods the shell structure is not clear. The delocalization shell structure of the electrons in zinc (Zn S-1(0)) is also displayed because the expected shell structure, corresponding to principal quantum number n = 4, was not firmly established by previous indicators until atomic number 32 was reached. The values of distinct maxima of the delocalization. indices, corresponding to regions within inner shells, are quite remarkable and related to the number of the electrons in each shell quantitatively. The physical meaning of these values is that the sharing of the core electrons in each shell does not extend to outer regions. The core shell structures in carbon (C P-3(0)) and silicon (Si P-3(0)) are mimicked by means of a set of the simulated natural orbitals (based on Slater's rules) used to construct the delocaliztaion index as a function of the distance from the nucleus. The separation of the contributions of definite angular momenta to the delocalization index for Ne S-1(0), Ar S-1(0), Zn S-1(0), Xe S-1(0), and Au S-2(1/2) is carried out. Interference effects between these contributions are substantially restricted to the valence region. The values of the maxima of the contributions of definite, angular momenta to the delocalization index are in agreement with the number of the s-, p-, d-, and f-electrons in each shell quantitatively. This is in agreement with well-known fact that the valence electrons only tend to be chemically active. The delocalization shell structures around the heavy atoms in the molecules LiH, H2O, CH4, SiH4, NH3, and PH3 are also displayed and compared to those around the single atoms Li S-2(1/2), O P-3(2), C P-3(0), Si P-3(0) N S-4(3/2), and P S-4(3/2). The delocalization of the core electrons remains essentially unchanged by incorporating the atoms into the molecules. The modifications of electron delocalization in the valence region are clear, and the chemically active regions in the molecules are nicely visible.

The enriched redox-active azo groups in the COFs can undergo a proton-coupled electron transfer reaction for energy storage, making the COFs ideal candidates for pseudocapacitance electrode materials. After in situ hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the composite exhibited a high three-electrode specific capacitance of 440 F g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1), among the highest for COF-based supercapacitors, and can retain 90 % capacitance even after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles. This is the first example using Grotthuss proton-conductive organic materials to create pseudocapacitors that exhibited both high power density and energy density. The assembled asymmetric two-electrode supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 71 Wh kg(-1) with a maximum power density of 42 kW kg(-1), surpassing that of all reported COF-based systems.

The acid hydrolysis of cassava pulp to reducing sugars and their fermentation to ethanol were evaluated in a fibrous-bed bioreactor with immobilized Delta ldh, a genetically engineered Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense. A maximum yield of total reducing sugars of 53.5% was obtained after 8 h of hydrolysis at 85 degrees C in 0.4 mol/L hydrochloric acid with a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1: 20, which was optimized by using an orthogonal design based on preliminary experiments. In the FBB, the fed-batch fermentation, using glucose as the sole carbon source, gave a maximum ethanol production of 38.3 g/L with a yield of 0.364 g/g in 100 h; whereas the fed-batch fermentation, using xylose as the sole carbon source, gave 34.1 g/L ethanol with a yield of 0.342 g/g in 135 h. When cassava pulp hydrolysate was used as a carbon source, 39.1 g/L ethanol with a yield of 0.123 g/g cassava pulp in185 h was observed, using the fed-batch fermentation model. In addition, for repeated batch fermentation of cassava pulp hydrolysate carried out in the fibrous-bed bioreactor, long-term operation with high ethanol yield and volumetric productivity were achieved. The above results show that the acid hydrolysate of cassava pulp can be used for ethanol production in a fibrous-bed bioreactor, although some inhibition phenomena were observed during the process of fermentation.

The purpose of this paper is to increase the content of SiC in the sintered body and improve the properties of SiC ceramics prepared by SLA/RMI technologies by the impregnation of the precursor of carbon source after debinding. The effects of the concentration of phenolic resin solution on the strength of sintered body were studied. The results show that this method can reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion and improve the thermal conductivity of the final body. At the same time, when the concentration of phenolic resin solution is 40 wt%, the final body obtained the best comprehensive properties. The value of bulk density, flexural strength and elastic modulus were 2.89 g/cm3, 244.17 +/- 5.13 MPa and 402.39 GPa, respectively. This strategy provides a promising prospect for the preparation of space optical mirrors with complex shapes and high strength by the SLA/RMI method.

In this paper, Ni/gamma Al2O3 and Ni/CeO2-gamma Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method. The catalyst performance for glucose gasification in supercritical water was tested in autoclave reactor. All experiments were carried out in the autoclave at 673 K, 24.5 MPa, and the concentration of glucose was 9.09 wt.%. The catalysts before and after reaction were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), BET specific surface area measurements, X-ray fluorescence spectrum (XRF) and Thermo-gravimetric analyses (TGA) in order to investigate on the chemical property and catalytic mechanism. The experimental results showed that hydrogen yield and hydrogen selectivity increased sharply with addition of Ni/gamma Al2O3 and Ni/CeO2-gamma Al2O3 catalysts. The catalytic activity and H-2 selectivity of Ni/CeO2-gamma Al2O3 was higher than that of Ni/gamma Al2O3 catalyst. The results revealed that carbon deposition and coking led to the deactivation of the catalysts. Ce in the Ni/CeO2-gamma Al2O3 catalyst had a certain role in the inhibition of carbon deposition and coking. (C) 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thermodynamic analysis of two-stage heat treatment in TRIP steels	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Transformation-induced plasticity steels; Thermodynamics; Retained austenite; Bainite; Bainitic transformation	TRANSFORMATION-INDUCED PLASTICITY; BAINITE TRANSFORMATION; RETAINED AUSTENITE; MARTENSITIC-TRANSFORMATION; DRIVING-FORCE; TEMPERATURE; KINETICS; CARBON; NUCLEATION; ADDITIONS	In this work, we present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the two-stage heat treatment (intercritical annealing (IA) and banite isothermal transformation (BIT)) necessary to stabilize retained austenite in transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) assisted steels. Through a set of experiments on alloys with nominal composition Fe-0.32C-1.42Mn-1.56Si (wt.%), we monitored the evolution of the volume fraction of retained austenite at room temperature as a function of the IA and BIT temperatures. We also investigated the thermodynamic limit for the bainitic transformation during BIT under the displacive (partitionless) transformation assumption. The fraction of retained austenite at the end of the two-stage heat treatment was calculated by taking into account the corresponding start of the martensitic transformation (T-Ms). Comparisons with experiments suggest good qualitative agreement in the fraction of retained austenite when considering the effect of the IA temperature. On the other hand, the analysis of the effect of BIT on the amount of retained austenite showed qualitative disagreement with the observations. To further analyze this discrepancy, we utilize a modified thermodynamic analysis with empirical observations as input, and conclude that the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium at IA is not valid at lower IA temperatures. Moreover, the unexpected high carbon enrichment in retained austenite indicates the importance of the kinetic effects. We conclude that the thermodynamic limit for the bainitic transformation can be used at least to provide a lower bound to the expected fraction of retained austenite under specific IA + BIT treatment schedules.

Highly dispersed spinel (Mg, Ca, Ba)-ferrite nanoparticles: Tuning the particle size and magnetic properties through a modified polyacrylamide gel route	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Magnetic nanoparticles; Polyacrylamide gel; Sintering temperature; Intermediate phase; Squareness ratio	MAGNESIUM FERRITE NANOPARTICLES; MFE2O4 M; MN; CO; TEMPERATURE; NI; NANOCOMPOSITES; FABRICATION; COMBUSTION; MORPHOLOGY	Highly dispersed ferrite magnetic nanoparticles (MFe2O4, where M=Mg, Ca, Ba) were synthesized through a modified polyacrylamide gel route based on the use of carbon particles. By manipulating the sintering temperature and carbon concentration, the formation of (Mg, Ca, Ba)-ferrite phase can be suppressed to produce the intermediate phases of MCO3 (M=Mg, Ca, Ba) and Fe2O3. The novel MFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles exhibited high crystallinity and hysteresis loop squareness ratio. Furthermore, the MFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles exhibited improved surface morphology when compared with nano-MFe2O4 of similar particle size synthesized by the polyacrylamide gel route reported in the literature. Morphology and magnetic properties of MFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles change also appears to be strongly dependent on the divalent metal M. These results bring up new ideas for the design of highly dispersed ferrite magnetic nanoparticles with tuned magnetic properties through a versatile polyacrylamide gel route.	[Wang, S.

However, it is still beyond practical application due to the low efficiency and poor selectivity. Therefore, a TiO2-MoSxSey heterostructured nanotree has been designed for product-oriented optimization of photocarrier transport during the photocatalytic CO2 fixation. The controllable S/Se ratio in MoSxSey can tweak the band edge, that is, the active energy level for CO2 fixation, achieving a tunable C-1 and C-2 production. TiO2 and MoSxSey synergizes under a dual-excitation mechanism to favor the separation and transports of the photocarriers. Prominently, a CH3CH2OH generation rate of 704.38 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) has been archived with S/Se < 1, while another C-1 product of HCOOH and a C-2 product of CH3COOH can be gradually obtained with S/Se > 1.

The high conductivity of such composite catalysts is induced by the Fe-S bond between FeS2 and MoS2 and Fe-N bond between FeS2 and g-C3N4. These two bonds of Fe-S and Fe-N can have a bridging function to provide efficient charge transfer channels between g-C3N4 and MoS2 via chemical bonding rather than physical attachment. Furthermore, the FeS2 sites can prevent the agglomeration of MoS2 nanosheets and also seed the MoS2 to form highly dispersed vertical growth nanosheets with more exposed edging active sites. As a result, this g-C3N4/FeS2/MoS2 catalyst exhibits both high catalytic HER activity and stability.

Carbonyl compounds are being explored as leading anode candidates for organic LIBs. In particular, cyclohexanehexanone (C6O6), as a perfect structure composed entirely of six -C(sic)O groups, can theoretically contribute to the most reactive sites and the highest specific capacity, but has not been used as an anode material so far owing to its high solubility in carbonate-based electrolytes and extremely low electronic conductivity. Herein, C6O6 is first revealed as an ultra-high capacity and high-rate anode material through a total eight-electron redox electrochemical process by effectively constructing an insoluble and highly conductive C6O6-polymeric binder-carbon network architecture. Experimental characterizations combined with first-principles calculations elucidate that -C(sic)O bonds in C6O6 can be lithiated to Li+ enolate (Li6C6O6) through a reversible six-Li-ion electrochemical process and further converted to Li8C6O6 dimers via a reversible two-electron pseudocapacitive Li+ intercalation reaction. As such, the C6O6 anode shows an ultrahigh capacity of up to 1404 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1) and an extraordinary high-rate durability (814 mAh g(-1) after 700 cycles at 5.0 A g-(1)). A 4.3 V high energy/power density Li-ion hybrid electrochemical capacitor based on the C6O6 anode is thus derived.

This study reports the detection of the presence of fluorescent NPs, about 5nm, in two of the most popular beverages, Coca-Cola (Coke) and Pepsi-Cola (Pepsi). The NPs contain H, C and O, three elements with a tunable emission and with a quantum yield of 3.3 and 4.3% for Coke and Pepsi, respectively. The presence of sp(3)-hybridized carbon atoms of alcohols and ethers bonds was confirmed by NMR analysis. The NPs can be taken up by living cells and accumulate within cell membrane and cytoplasm. Evaluation of the acute toxicity of the NPs revealed that the BALB/c mice appeared healthy after administration of a single dose of 2g kg(-1) body weight. Analysis of glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), urea and creatinine showed that there were statistically, but not biologically, significant differences in some of these biochemical parameters between the test and control groups. No obvious organ damage or apparent histopathological abnormality was observed in the tested mice. The biodistribution study in major organs indicated that the NPs were easily accumulated in the digestive tract, and they were able to cross the blood-brain barrier and dispersed in the brain. In vitro digestion of the NPs showed a significant fluorescence quenching of the NPs. This work represents the first report of foodborne fluorescent NPs present in Coke and Pepsi, and provides valuable insights into physicochemical properties of these NPs and their toxicity characteristics both in vitro and in vivo.

Polymer thermal optical switches at 532 nm are rarely reported, because of switching extinction ratio properties that are restricted by modes of the waveguide. Single mode waveguide at 532 nm is hard to fabricate due to the dissolution of core and cladding materials. A polymer M-Z thermal optical switch at 532 nm was first demonstrated based on the wet etching method. The proposed thermal optical switch was consisted of silica substrate, photosensitive polymer core, and cladding material. The device was fabricated and tested with the power consumption of 6.55mW, extinction of 4.8 dB, and switching time of 0.23 ms (rise)/0.28 ms (down). An optimized switch structure combining with the UV-writing technique and graphene thermal conduction layer was proposed based on the experiments above. A side electrode was designed to reduce the power consumption and the switching time. The optimized device was calculated to have a power consumption of 1.5 mW. The switching time of the UV-writing device was simulated to be 18.2 mu s (rise) and 85 mu s (down). The device is promising in the wearable device and laser radar area.

Direct radiative forcing and climate effects of anthropogenic aerosols with different mixing states over China	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Anthropogenic aerosols; Direct effects; Radiative forcing; Externally mixing states; Internally mixing states; China	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; BLACK CARBON; REGIONAL CLIMATE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SULFATE AEROSOLS; ART.; VARIABILITY; ABSORPTION; EMISSIONS	An online coupled regional climate and chemistry model was used to investigate the direct effects of anthropogenic aerosols (sulfate, nitrate, black carbon BC and organic carbon OC) with different mixing states over China. Three mixing assumptions were considered, including external (EM), internal (IM, BC-core surrounded by well mixed scattering-shells) and partially internal (PIM, 32.2% of sulfate and nitrate, 35.5% of BC and 48.5% of OC were internally mixed) mixtures. Results indicated that high levels of anthropogenic aerosols were found in Southwest and Central to East China. Regional mean surface loadings of sulfate, nitrate, BC, primary OC over China were 9.56, 3.64, 2.30, and 2.99 mu g m(-3), respectively. PIM-aerosol optical depth and single scattering albedo, which were consistent with AERONET and satellite observations, were 0.51 +/- 0.37 and 0.95 +/- 0.02 in Central to East China, implying that proportions of internally mixed aerosols in PIM were reasonable to some degrees. Both aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) and corresponding climate responses were sensitive to aerosol mixing states and BC/OC hygroscopicities. The more BC was internally mixed or hydrophilic, the more solar radiation was absorbed, thus leading to more decreases in cloud amount (CA) and subsequently less surface cooling. Combining with the uncertainties of BC/OC hygroscopicities, regional mean PIM-aerosol DRF at the top of atmosphere ranged from -0.78 to -0.61 W m(-2) in all-sky and from -5.24 to -4.95 W m(-2) in clear-sky. Additionally, responses of cloud amount and water path, total column absorbed solar radiation (TCASR), surface air temperature and precipitation (TP) to PIM-aerosol DRFs over China were about -0.45 similar to -0.37%, -0.44 similar to -0.32 g m(-2), +0.69 similar to +0.72 W m(-2), -0.13 similar to -0.11 K and -4.56 similar to -4.29%, respectively. These responses were also sensitive to the lateral boundary condition perturbations especially for CA, TCASR and TP, while DRFs themselves were not. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the preparation of solid electrolytes with high lithium-ion conductivity and superior electrode-electrolyte interface contact is the development needs. In this study, the electronic structures of garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and Sb-doped LLZO electrolytes were investigated using the first-principles method based on density functional theory (DFT). Theoretical calculations have confirmed that elemental doping facilitates the migration of lithium ions in solid-state electrolytes at the micro-atomic level. Based on the theoretical calculations and analysis results, Li6.7La3Zr1.7Sb0.3O12 (LLZSbO) with high ionic conductivity was synthesized by the conventional solid-state method. To reduce the interfacial impedance between electrolyte and electrode, the composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) containing LLZSbO active fillers were prepared by the solution casting method. The prepared CSEs exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 0.97 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 30 degrees C and a stable electrochemical window of 5.3 V as well as the lithium-ion transference number up to 0.37. The all-solid-state battery using the CSEs prepared with 20 wt% LLZSbO has excellent rate performance and cycle stability. The initial discharge specific capacity can reach 148.4 mAh g(-1) when the rate is 0.1 C. The capacity can cover 138.8 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.2 C with a capacity retention rate of 97.5%.

Three-dimensional Al-substituted quasi-concentration gradient Ni-Co layered double hydroxide nanosheets for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors	MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY			English	Article						Al substitution; Concentration gradient heterostructure; Ni-Co LDH nanosheet; Electrochemical performance; Supercapacitors	ELECTRODE MATERIALS; ENERGY-CONVERSION; CARBON SPHERES; POROUS CARBONS; NICKEL FOAM; CAPACITANCE; MICROSPHERES; TEMPERATURE; FABRICATION; SHEETS	Based on an easy-to-operate stepwise electrochemical deposition method, Al-substituted layered bimetallic hydroxide (Ni-Co layered double hydroxide [LDH]) with quasi-concentration gradient (AlQCG) was deposited on Ni foam. The three-dimensional porous heterostructured Al-QCG could significantly accelerate electron conduction and facilitate electrolyte penetration, effectively improving the specific capacitance and rate performance of the supercapacitor. In addition, Al substitution changed the crystal structure of LDH and prevented local agglomeration and splitting of the layered nanosheets effectively during reproducible charge/discharge cycling, further improving the electrode's cyclic stability. Al-QCG demonstrated an excellent specific capacity of 2372.6 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 1180.0 F g(-1) at 20 A g(-1), and the cycling stability of the Al-QCG/NF electrode greatly improved from 30.0% of bulk NieCo LDH to 86.1% after 5000 cycles at 20 A g(-1). The asymmetrical supercapacitors (ASCs) with the activated carbon anode also displayed a high specific capacitance of 48.1 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and it remained at 56.3% of its capacity when the current density increased to 10 A g(-1). The ASCs achieved a maximum energy density of 15.0 Wh/kg at 763.4 W/kg and an impressive capacitance retention of 90.9% after 10,000 cycles at 2 A g(-1), showing promising application in high-performance supercapacitors. This work highlighted the complex interactions between the composition of different element ratios and multidimensional morphology on the dynamics and capacitive performance of LDH materials.

Transport properties of spirobisindane-containing polymers were investigated along with fractional free volume and density measurements, as well as molecular simulation analysis. The resulting spiroTR-PBOs exhibited high free volumes and superior mechanical properties in terms of elongation and tensile strength, and these findings were supported by molecular dynamic simulations. SpiroTR-PBO membranes containing hexafluoroisopropylidene moiety in the polymer backbone showed a six-fold increase in CO2 permeability, compared to that of the spiroHPI precursor. SpiroTR-PBO membranes showed strong potential to be applied in carbon capture and separation of gases because of their high gas permeability coupled with robust mechanical properties.

The graphite felt was treated in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave for different time at 180 degrees C. The content of nitrogen in the PAN graphite felt changed from 3.803% to 5.367% by adjusting treatment time to 15 h in ammonia solution, while FT-IR results indicated that nitrogenous groups were introduced. The electrochemical properties of these graphite felts were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, as well as cell charge and discharge tests. The energy efficiency of the treated graphite felt reached 85% at a current density of 20 mA/cm(2). The corresponding coulombic efficiency and voltage efficiency were 95.3% and 75.1%, respectively. The improvement of the electrochemical properties for the treated graphite felt might be attributed to the increase of polar nitrogenous groups of carbon fiber surface, which facilitated charge transfer between electrode and vanadium ions.

In this approach, stilbene (PhCH = CHPh)-based precursors undergo an oxidative photocyclization reaction to join the two adjacent aromatic rings into an extended aromatic structure. However, if one C = C carbon atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom (C = N), the synthesis becomes practically infeasible. Here, we show the very first examples of a successful Mallory reaction on stilbene-like imine precursors involving the molecularly curved corannulene nucleus. The isolated yields exceed 90% and the resulting single and double aza[4]helicenes exhibit adjustable high affinity for electrons.

J	Tao, WY; Kasuga, T; Li, S; Huang, H; Fan, ZL				Tao, Weiyi; Kasuga, Takao; Li, Shuang; Huang, He; Fan, Zhiliang			Homoethanol production from cellobionate and glycerol using recombinant Klebsiella oxytoca strains	BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Cellobionate; Ethanol; Gycerol; Co-fermentation; Redox recycling; Klebsiella oxytoca	ETHANOL-PRODUCTION; CELLULOSE; PATHWAY	Cellobionic acid, an oxidized cellulose degradation product, can be produced from cellulosic biomass. Engineered strains of Klebsiella oxytoca BW21 and WT26 can effectively use cellobionate for ethanol production. However, because cellobionate is a more oxidized substrate than cellobiose, oxidized products such as acetate must be produced as by-products to maintain the overall redox balance, and homoethanol production is not possible. One of the strategies to avoid the redox imbalance problem and achieve homoethanol production is cofermentation of cellobionate with a more reduced substrate glycerol. When cellobionate and glycerol were used as the carbon source by K. oxytoca BW 21, ethanol yield was about 62%-67%. Co-utilization of cellobionate and glycerol in batch fermentation increased the yield of ethanol to about 77% and substantially decreased the accumulation of by-products (such as acetate and 1,3-propanediol). However, glycerol imposes carbon catabolite repression on cellobionate utilization. The utilization rate mismatch between these two substrates limits the benefits of redox recycling between the two substrates' utilization pathways. When recombinant strain WT26 (which is disabled in glycerol utilization when fermented alone) was used to co-ferment cellobionate and glycerol, the two substrates' utilization rates exactly matched, which led to an ethanol yield improvement to 96%.

Their widespread applications are sometimes hindered by the intrinsic instability of frameworks. However, this instability of MOFs can also be exploited for useful purposes. Herein, we report the use of MOFs as metal ion precursors for constructing functional nanocomposites by utilizing the instability of MOFs. The heterogeneous growth process of nanostructures on substrates involves the release of metal ions, nucleation on substrates, and formation of a covering structure. Specifically, the synthesized CoS with carbon nanotubes as substrates display enhanced performance in a lithium-ion battery. Such strategy not only presents a new way for exploiting the instability of MOFs but also supplies a prospect for designing versatile functional nanocomposites.

The bioflocculants produced by 33% of the microbial communities had flocculating efficiencies higher than 90%. Six out of the eight microbial communities with efficiencies over 94% were screened from the culture medium using dibutyl phthalate (DBP) as the carbon source. BF-BCT, which was derived from the Chinese cabbage soil sample, had the highest flocculating efficiency (99.6%), species diversity and uniformity. Nine highly efficient strains were separated and purified from seven different microbial communities, indicating that flocculating microorganisms are widely distributed in ecosystems. The 16S rRNA gene testing shows that the eight bacterial and the one fungal strains are common soil microorganisms. The flocculating abilities of BB11 (Sphingobacterium multivorum) and SE3 (Galactomyces geotrichum) have never been reported hitherto. Six strains, including the most flocculating-active TB13 and JB17, were screened from the culture medium using DBP as the sole carbon source. In particular, we compared the performance of culture media and analyzed analogous microbial communities with a Biolog automatic micro-analysis system for the first time.

Detailed structural information about carotenoid esters is significant not only for the assessment of nutritional quality, but also for tracing biosynthetic precursors. Methods The profiling of carotenoid esters in P. monodon was elucidated using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap-HRMS). The raw LC/MS data were analyzed using Exact Finder (TM) software. Results The structurally relevant ions, *l and *m, were considered markers of the astaxanthin monoester. Moreover, the carotenoid skeleton was unequivocally identified using the diagnostic ions *i, *j/*j' and *g/*g' generated by the carbon-carbon bond cleavage between beta-ionone ketones and conjugated polyene moieties. In total, 24 carotenoid esters were identified in P. monodon based on the fragmentation patterns discussed above. The identified carotenoid skeleton includes astaxanthin, astacene, oxidized astaxanthin and adonixanthin, which have been described for the first time. Conclusions Characterization of the unknown carotenoid esters demonstrates the capabilities of this methodology, which is significant for enriching the carotenoid species in P. monodon.

Air velocities, number of vehicles and the concentrations of gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were measured at different depths of the ramp. The relationship between these data sets was analysed statistically. The results showed that the gaseous pollution in most sections of the ramp was severe except the section close to the ground entrance. In the sections close to the main production area, the concentrations of CO, CO2 and NO2 exceeded the Chinese air quality standards more than two times, posing a health and safety risk to underground miners. Given that the air velocity in the ramp was generally lower than 0.5 m/s, increasing the air flow rate in the entire ventilation network may help to control the gaseous pollution. However, the added energy cost of the exhaust fans should be evaluated. It may be more cost-effective to reduce vehicle emissions by improving the performance of automobile engines or by adopting high-efficiency exhaust control systems. These alternatives are important considerations for further study.

Interfacial engineering, creating abundant interfaces with active sites when combining different materials, is of critical importance to not only modify the local structure of the electrocatalysts but also modulate the catalytic kinetics during the electrocatalytic reaction, thus offering a promising route toward unexpected electrocatalytic activity. Herein, graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN), which is electrochemically inert, is decorated onto the molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) surface to construct a MoS2/g-CN heterogeneous structure via a simple hydrothermal method. After integrating g-CN, an enlarged surface area, interfacial charge redistribution, and moderate surface-hydrogen adsorption are achieved without affecting the MoS2 morphology. Consequently, the MoS2/g-CN heterostructure exhibits a comparable electrocatalytic activity: a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 141 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). This work indicates the importance of interfacial engineering as an effective strategy for the rational design of electrocatalysts.

Herein, polycarbosilane (PCS), polysiloxane, phenol-formaldehyde, and epoxy resin, which were introduced to prepare slurries with Si powder, and subsequently used to modify cylindrical C/C preforms into C/C-SiC composites. Results show that the PCS-Si slurry has the best RMI capability, by which, a cylindrical C/C preform (1.35 g-cm(-3)) was modified successfully to into a dense C/C-SiC composite (1.92 g.cm(-3)). PCS plays a vital role in fixing the coating to prevent it from falling off the surface of the C/C preform in PCS-Si slurry RMI. Both of the degree of densification and flexural strength of the C/C-SiC composites increase with an increase in the thickness of the PCS-Si slurry coating. The overreaction of the PCS-Si slurry RMI was effectively suppressed because the content of Si powder is reasonably controlled in the PCS-Si slurry coating. Moreover, nozzle-shaped C/C composites were successfully modified into a C/C-SiC composite for the first time using PCS-Si slurry RMI.

SANS measurement avoided the correlation peak associated to the semi crystalline nature of HDPE from SAXS, and the passible scattering from the stretch induced voids. Benefitting from SANS data, the power law (alpha) taking the flexible cylinder suggested that whole MWCNTs in the unstretched composites follow a self-avoiding random walk (alpha approximate to 1.67). SANS data suggest a hollow flexible cylinder structure with outer and inner diameters (core-shell-like cross section) of the scatterers as ca. 12.6 nm and 4.1 nm, while the Kuhn length is about 43.0 nm. Tensile test displayed improved mechanical properties. Interestingly, the Hermans orientation parameter (f) of HDPE crystals (f(c)) in the stretched composites are around a plateau ca. 0.96 initially, while decreased remarkably to 0.776 when the fraction is further increased to 2.0 wt %. f obtained by SANS showed a similar tendency (decreased from 0.756 to 0.572). Combining all the results along with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement, a mechanism of adhered crystals on the surface of MWCNTs and a reinforcement model are proposed.

Factors controlling the formation of hierarchical zeolite were investigated in detail. Despite having comparable acid properties, the increased external surfaces offer the hierarchical ZSM-5n an excellent catalytic performance. After reaction for 414 h, the hierarchical ZSM-5n catalyst still keeps a 88.5% conversion of isopropylbenzene, while the ZSM-5 mu and ZSM-5m catalysts only show 37.5% (25.8 h), 28.2% (11 h) conversions, respectively; the initial conversion of n-octane over ZSM-5n is 94.3 wt %, obviously higher than 82.8 wt % on ZSM-5 mu, the half-life period related to the catalytic activity on ZSM-5n and ZSM-5 mu are 271 h, and 22 h, respectively. The prolonged catalysis life for hierarchical ZSM-5n during the catalytic cracking of n-octane is ascribed to the shortened diffusion path length and an "excretory system", carbon nanotubes (CNTs) self-generating during the cracking processing. The shortened microporous channels attribute to weakening adsorption energy barrier and promoting the coke precursors rapid diffusing toward the pore windows. Moreover, the autogenetic CNTs help the carbon precursors escaping from the pore windows and keep them far away from the zeolite crystals in the catalysts. That avoids the carbon deposit in the micropores as well as in the pore windows and on the external surface of the catalyst.

This work proposed a coal-to-SNG process, which combines a high-efficiency coal-steam gasification and one-step methanation. Through regenerative unit, the sensible heat of the syngas can be recovered via the oxidant steam and then finally converted into chemical energy of syngas, and thereby the cold gas efficiency can be 8.8 percentage points higher than the traditional GE gasification. The HZ/CO mole ratio of syngas leaving the gasifier is about 1.2 which can be used for one-step methanation directly and the traditional water gas shift process can be eliminated. Simulation and thermodynamic analysis of the whole plant are presented, and the experimental study of coke-steam gasification is carried out in a fixed bed reactor. Preliminary experiments show that when gasification temperature is higher than 1000 degrees C, the H-2/CO ratio of the syngas is approximately 1.3-1.4. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the SNG conversion efficiency of the proposed process increases from 61.3% to 71.7% and the energy consumption for SNG product has been reduced from 84 GJ/t to 60.5 GJ/t, mainly due to the cold gas efficiency enhancement of gasification and elimination of water gas shift process. Besides, through the one-step methanation, the concentration of CO2 before CO2 separation unit increases from 31.1% to 43.2%, and the unit energy consumption in the CO2 capture decreases from 15.3 kJ/mol to 11.7 kJ/mol.

The WA/PIL hydrogels integrated the representative properties of both wood and ionic liquids, being a promising candidate for both polyelectrolyte and separator materials. The influences of the wood texture and cross-linker (Bis) content on the mechanical and sensing performances of the hydrogels were investigated. The results showed that the tangential hydrogel slice with a 1.0 mol% Bis content (tan 1.0) displayed the most significant improvement in compressive stress (1.65 MPa) and deformation (73.3%) at fracture, suggesting the best compressibility. Electrodes also played a significant role in the sensitivity and stability of the sensor devices. While tan 1.0 with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrodes displayed the largest sensitivities (1.13-19.70 MPa-1), tan 1.0 with Ni foams possessed much more stable ionic signals within the whole stress range with sensitivities of 0.33-9.67 MPa-1. Due to the wide-stress-range responsiveness of our hydrogel sensor from gentle finger contact to vigorous hitting modes, it will find promising applications in various human-machine interfaces in the fields of electronics, recreation, sports, etc.	[Shen, Xiaoping; Nie, Kangchen; Zheng, Li; Wang, Zhaosong; Wang, Zhe; Li, Song; Jin, Chunde; Sun, Qingfeng] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Sch Engn, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China		Jin, CD; Sun, QF (corresponding author), Zhejiang A&F Univ, Sch Engn, Hangzhou 311300, Peoples R China.		shen, xiaoping/ABF-7863-2021	shen, xiaoping/0000-0003-0366-6433	National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFD0600302]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [2018QNRC001]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LQ19C160015]; National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students [201910341010]; Research and Development Project of ZAFU [2017FR039]	National Key R&D Program of China; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students; Research and Development Project of ZAFU	This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFD0600302), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (2018QNRC001), the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LQ19C160015), the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students (201910341010), and the Research and Development Project of ZAFU (2017FR039).		40	10	10	24	100	ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY	CAMBRIDGE	THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND	2050-7526	2050-7534		J MATER CHEM C	J.

PPy, as a kind of conductive polymers, can be regarded as the Ohmic contact in Z-scheme systems. Furthermore, PPy serves as a charge transmission bridge between the g-C3N4 and the Bi2WO6. The g-C3N4/PPy/Bi2WO6 sample with the PPy amount of 0.5 wt% (GPB-0.5) exhibits enhanced visible-light absorption and high electron-hole separation efficiency. It can remove 98.0% of RhB within 100 min, the photocatalytic activity of which is higher than that of other control samples. Both photoelectrochemical test and scavenging experiment identify that h(+) and center dot O-2(-) are the main active species in the photocatalysis process. Our work could offer a new sight to design and fabricate photocatalyst with excellent utilization efficiency of solar energy.

We show that the passivation quality strongly depends on the ozone concentration: the higher ozone concentration results in lower interface defect density and thereby improved passivation. In contrast to previous studies, our results reveal that too high interface hydrogen content can be detrimental to the passivation. The interface hydrogen concentration can be optimized by the ozone-based process; however, the use of pure ozone increases the harmful carbon concentration in the film. Here we demonstrate that low carbon and optimal hydrogen concentration can be achieved by a single process combining the water-and ozone-based reactions. This process results in an interface defect density of 2 x 10(11) eV(-1) cm(-2),and maximum surface recombination velocities of 7.1 cm/s and 10 cm/s, after annealing and after an additional firing at 800 degrees C, respectively. In addition, our results suggest that the effective oxide charge density can be optimized in a simple way by varying the ozone concentration and by injecting water to the ozone process.

However, there is still controversy on whether low-order (finer) or high-order (coarser) roots decay faster. Previous studies on root decomposition often used dried root samples, and the dehydrating process may influence the results. In this study, we aimed to examine the decomposability of low- and high-order roots and whether initial moisture status would influence their decomposition. Methods We carried out a one-year litterbag experiment for roots of a subtropical tree species Liquidambar formosana. Roots for the decomposition were divided into low- (1st and 2nd orders) and high-order (3rd and 4th orders) classes, and were dried or kept fresh before being buried into the soil. Results We found that low-order roots were decomposed slower (half the rate of high-order roots in terms of mass loss), and the content of soluble carbohydrates was the main influencing factor. We also found that drying prior to decomposition facilitated the decomposition of high-order roots during the early stage by 10%. Conclusions Our study suggests that litter carbon quality, particularly soluble carbohydrate content, is the major driver for root decomposition, and that previous studies using dried root samples might have overestimated short-term root decomposition.

The high surface area material (17793 m(2) g(-1)) has major mesopore distribution centered at 2-4 nm, exhibiting super-fast adsorption and efficient catalytic degradation of organic dyes within 5 min, i.e., methylene blue (Q(e,exp) = 531 mg g(-1)), methy red (Q(e,exp) = 500 mg g(-1)), malachite green (Q(e,exp) = 500 mg g(-1)) and methy orange (Q(e,exp) = 500 mg g(-1)). Detailed characterization and mechanism shows that the super-fast removal ability is ascribed to the stronger electrostatic interaction between Fe/Fe3C/C composites and dye, and the breaking of chromophore group though the redox reaction. Particularly, the adsorption isotherm of methylene blue in aqueous solution follows a Langmuir isotherm model at an adsorption capacity of up to 641.0 mg g(-1) at 298 K.

Natural cellulose substances (e. g., commercial laboratory cellulose filter paper) possesses unique three-dimensionally cross-linked porous structures and abundant functional groups for the functional modification on the surfaces. The deposition of metal oxide gel film on the surfaces of the cellulose nanofibers is facilely to be achieved through the surface sol-gel process, resulting in metal oxide replicas of the initial cellulose substance or metal-oxide/carbon nanocomposites. Moreover, the as-deposited metal oxide gel films coated on the cellulose fiber surfaces provide ideal platforms for the further formation of specific functional assemblies, and eventually to the corresponding nanocomposite materials. Based on this methodology, various nanostructured composites were prepared and employed as anodic materials for lithium-ion batteries, including metal-oxides-based (such as SnO2, TiO2, MoO3, FexOy, and SiO2) and Si-based composites, as summarized in this personal account. Benefiting from the unique hierarchically porous network structures and the synergistic effects among the composite components of the anodic materials, the transfer of electrons/ions is accelerated and the structural stability of the electrode is enhanced, leading to the improved lithium storage performances and promoted cycling stability.

Marine bacterial transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and TEP precursors: Characterization and RO fouling potential	DESALINATION			English	Article						Biofouling; Marine bacteria; Reverse osmosis; Transparent exopolymer particles	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; WATER; DESALINATION; MEMBRANES; BACTERIOPLANKTON; CARBON; AGENTS; FRESH; SEA	This paper investigated the characteristics and membrane fouling potential of bacterial transparent exopolymer particles (TEP)/TEP precursors released from two marine bacteria, Pseudidiomarina homiensis (P. homiensis) and Pseudoalteromonas atlantica (P. atlantica), isolated from the Red Sea. Results showed that both bacteria grew at the similar rate, but the production of TEP/TEP precursors from P. atlantica was higher than that from P. homiensis. During the 168 h of incubation time, production rates of TEP/TEP precursors from P. atlantica and P. homiensis were 030 and 0.08 xanthan gum eq. mg/L-h, respectively. Isolated bacterial TEP precursors were mainly biopolymer, and P. atlantica produced a significantly higher concentration of biopolymer than that produced by P. homiensis. TEP/TEP precursors from both marine bacteria possessed protein-like material and were very similar in composition to previously reported foulants isolated from a fouled reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. Bacterial TEP/TEP precursors mostly consisted of aliphatic hydrocarbon from amino acids and amide group carbon of proteins (around 55%). Bacterial TEP precursors caused obvious fouling on RO membranes, which may create an ideal environment for bacteria attachment and promote to biofouling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Insights on organic aerosol aging and the influence of coal combustion at a regional receptor site of central eastern China	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							RESOLVED CHEMICAL-CHARACTERIZATION; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; URBAN SUPERSITE T0; PEARL RIVER DELTA; NEW-YORK-CITY; HIGH-RESOLUTION; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; MASS-SPECTROMETER; SOA FORMATION; RURAL SITE	In order to understand the aging and processing of organic aerosols (OA), an intensive field campaign (Campaign of Air Pollution at Typical Coastal Areas IN Eastern China, CAPTAIN) was conducted March-April at a receptor site (a Changdao island) in central eastern China. Multiple fast aerosol and gas measurement instruments were used during the campaign, including a high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) that was applied to measure mass concentrations and non-refractory chemical components of submicron particles (PM1nr). The average mass concentration of PM1(PM1nr+black carbon) was 47 +/- 36 mu g m(-3) during the campaign and showed distinct variation, depending on back trajectories and their overlap with source regions. Organic aerosol (OA) is the largest component of PM1 (30%), followed by nitrate (28%), sulfate (19%), ammonium (15%), black carbon (6%), and chloride (3%). Four OA components were resolved by positive matrix factorization (PMF) of the high-resolution spectra, including low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LV-OOA), semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and a coal combustion OA (CCOA). The mass spectrum of CCOA had high abundance of fragments from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (m/z 128, 152, 178, etc.). The average atomic ratio of oxygen to carbon in OA (O/C) at Changdao was 0.59, which is comparable to other field studies reported at locations downwind of large pollution sources, indicating the oxidized nature of most OA during the campaign. The evolution of OA elemental composition in the van Krevelen diagram (H/C vs. O/C) showed a slope of -0.63; however, the OA influenced by coal combustion exhibits a completely different evolution that appears dominated by physical mixing. The aging of organic aerosols vs. photochemical age was investigated. It was shown that OA/Delta CO, as well as LV-OOA/Delta CO and SV-OOA/Delta CO, positively correlated with photochemical age. LV-OOA accounted for 73% of the OA secondary formation (SOA) in the oldest plumes (photochemical age of 25 h). The kOH at Changdao, by assuming SOA formation and aging as a first-order process proportional to OH, was calculated to be 5.2x10(-12) cm(3) molec.(-1) s(-1), which is similar to those determined in recent studies of polluted air in other continents.

Modeling methane and nitrous oxide emissions from direct-seeded rice systems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						trace gas emissions; greenhouse gas; rice paddy soil; mitigation; DNDC; carbon offsets	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ORYZA-SATIVA L.; FLOODED RICE; WATER MANAGEMENT; CH4 EMISSIONS; SOIL CHARACTERISTICS; STRAW INCORPORATION; FIELD VALIDATION; FALLOW SEASON; PADDY FIELDS	Process-based modeling of CH4 and N2O emissions from rice fields is a practical tool for conducting greenhouse gas inventories and estimating mitigation potentials of alternative practices at the scale of management and policy making. However, the accuracy of these models in simulating CH4 and N2O emissions in direct-seeded rice systems under various management practices remains a question. We empirically evaluated the denitrification-decomposition model for estimating CH4 and N2O fluxes in California rice systems. Five and nine site-year combinations were used for calibration and validation, respectively. The model was parameterized for two cultivars, M206 and Koshihikari, and able to simulate 30% and 78% of the variation in measured yields, respectively. Overall, modeled and observed seasonal CH4 emissions were similar (R-2=0.85), but there was poor correspondence in fallow period CH4 emissions and in seasonal and fallow period N2O emissions. Furthermore, management effects on seasonal CH4 emissions were highly variable and not well represented by the model (0.2-465% absolute relative deviation). Specifically, simulated CH4 emissions were oversensitive to fertilizer N rate but lacked sensitivity to the type of seeding system (dry seeding versus water seeding) and prior fallow period straw management. Additionally, N2O emissions were oversensitive to fertilizer N rate and field drainage. Sensitivity analysis showed that CH4 emissions were highly sensitive to changes in the root to total plant biomass ratio, suggesting that it is a significant source of model uncertainty. These findings have implications for model-directed field research that could improve model representation of paddy soils for application at larger spatial scales.

The continuous consumption of this nonrenewable resource has caused very serious environment problems, which has motivated tremendous research efforts in this century. Energy storage is critical to alleviate the current energy and environmental problems. Comparing to mechanical energy storage, rechargeable batteries allow energy storage with a smaller footprint. The intersection of rechargeable battery with nanomaterials has been a booming research topic recently and yielded new applications of nanomaterials as well as new solutions to many long-lived problems in battery science and technology. In this Perspective, we highlight the most recent (2015-2017) examples across lithium, sodium and zinc battery chemistries, where nanoscale materials tailoring and design addresses the intrinsic problems and limitations at both the materials level and device level. And a few principles are generalized at the end.

It was found in this work that the gas in the upper gas group of weathered crust (O(1)m(5)(1+2)) reservoirs and the C-P gas had similar delta C-13(1) and delta C-13(3) compositions and they were less negative than those of the gas in the lower gas group (O(1)m(5)(4)). While all weathered crust gases had delta C-13(2) values that are more negative than the C-P gases. The O(1)m(5)(4) gas and C-P gas had a very clear boundary in delta DCH4 value, while the O(1)m(5)(1+2) gas had the delta DCH4 ranges intersecting with the two others. The C-P gas is inferred derived from coal measures. The O(1)m(5)(1+2) gas near erosional valley-form is a mixture of coal-derived gas and marine sapropelic gas, and the remaining Ordovician gases are inferred to originate from marine sapropelic source rock. Both gases were characterized by secondary cracking gas, and thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) altered the chemical and isotopic composition of weathered crust gas to a lesser extent due to short TSR reaction time. The changes in water type and total dissolved solids from the Permian to the Ordovician and the D shift phenomenon of O(1)m(5)(1+2) water, reveals the fluid vertical migration between the Upper and Lower Paleozoic. Coupled with geological evolution analysis, the ancient erosional valley-form and the surrounding solution cavities and fractures are inferred the main migration channels for coal-derived gas into weathered crust reservoir. Moreover, three vertical gas-filling modes are proposed, i.e., gas seepage in free phase, diffusion phase and water-solution phase, with the importance in descending order.

This study examined the influence of soil physico-chemical properties and topographic features on bacterial communities and diversity in a commercial potato field with a rolling landform. Eighty-three soil samples were systematically collected across a transect 1100 m long. A significant negative correlation (r = -0.73) between soil pH (range 4.3-7.0) and slope gradient (range 1.8-11.9%) was observed. Regressions and/or a canonical correspondence analysis showed that pH, slope gradient and organic carbon were the major factors influencing bacterial a-diversity based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Semivariogram analyses revealed that the bacterial adiversity, the relative abundance of most phyla, pH and slope gradient showed strong to medium spatial autocorrelations with a range between 20.8 and 217.8 m. These results evidenced that soil pH and slope gradient were the major factors explaining variation in the spatial structure of the bacterial community. Our results showed that the soil bacterial communities varied in a systematic and predictable pattern in an agricultural field in response to variation in soil physico-chemical properties and topographic features.

In the present study, soil and root fungal communities in a fine-scale grassland were determined using high through-put sequencing, and our aims are to evaluate the relative importance of plant composition, soil elements and space factors on these two fungal communities. Our results showed that (1) fungal communities in soil and plant roots were distinct from each other, and OTU richness in soil was significantly higher than that in plant roots; (2) biomass of perennial rhizome grass, soil carbon content, and soil C/P ratio were key drivers for both soil and root fungal community; (3) dissimilarity of the soil fungal community significantly correlated with spatial distance, while no significant correlations were found between dissimilarity of root-associated fungal community and spatial distance. These results suggest the different spatial patterns of root and soil fungal communities which may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms maintaining root and soil fungal communities at small scales in this grassland ecosystem.

Determination of hydrogen loading in the carrier system diphenylmethane/dicyclohexylmethane by depolarized Raman spectroscopy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY			English	Article						LOHC; Degree of hydrogenation; Depolarized Raman spectroscopy; Diphenylmethane; In-situ process monitoring	PHASE-EQUILIBRIA; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CO2 SOLUBILITY; N-OCTACOSANE; LIQUID; STORAGE; DIBENZYLTOLUENE; MIXTURES; QUANTIFICATION; TECHNOLOGIES	During the processes of hydrogenation or dehydrogenation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), knowledge of the current degree of hydrogenation (DoH) is often essential. The present study shows that depolarized Raman spectroscopy allows the accurate determination of the DoH of the model LOHC system diphenylmethane (H0-DPM)/dicyclohexylmethane (H12-DPM) at temperatures up to 573 K. Using two independent experimental setups and binary mixtures of H0- and H12-DPM, a temperature-independent calibration factor could be obtained by analyzing Raman bands characteristic for the aromatic and aliphatic carbon rings. The successful transfer of the calibration to technical mixtures is validated by DoH measurements of samples from deliberately stopped hydrogenation reactions containing also the intermediate cyclohexylphenylmethane (H6-DPM) and of pure H6-DPM. Here, the average absolute deviation of the DoHs obtained by depolarized Raman spectroscopy from those measured analytically is 0.018, which demonstrates the applicability of the method at arbitrary and process-relevant temperatures.

The experimental results showed that 4 photosynthetic membrane lipids were labeled , and the labeling content increased gradually during the whole platform. Besides , spatial structure played a decisive role in labeling priority and provided insight into photosynthetic glycolipids synthesis in marine diatoms based on MS/MS , including suggestion of an preferably labeled of backbone-linked headgroups , and then was the glycerol skeleton and fatty acid substituents. It was also observed that C-13 incorporated into those headgroups almost simultaneously. The method could directly and accurately illuminate the utilization of carbon atoms by photosynthetic glycerolipids in Nitzschiaclosterium f. minutissima. It provided a reference analysis platform for exploring the assimilation process of microalgae lipid biomarkers in the future by Sinonovaculaconstricta.

In this paper, a ground-based low-resolution remote sensing system measuring the total columns of CO2 and CH4 is developed, which tracks the sun automatically and records the spectra in real-time and has the advantages of portability and low cost. A spectral inversion algorithm based on nonlinear least squares spectral fitting procedure for determining the column concentrations of these species is described. Atmospheric transmittance spectra are computed line-by-line in the forward model and observed on-line by direct solar radiation. Also, the wavelength shifts are introduced and the influence of spectral resolution is discussed. Based on this system and algorithm, the vertical columns of O-2, CO2, and CH4 are calculated from total atmospheric observation transmittance spectra in Hefei, and the results show that the column averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 are measured with accuracies of 3.7% and 5%, respectively. Finally, the H2O columns are compared with the results observed by solar radiometer at the same site and the calculated correlation coefficient is 0.92, which proves that this system is suitable for field campaigns and used to monitor the local greenhouse gas sources under the condition of higher accuracy, indirectly.

Electrical conductivity modeling and experimental study of densely packed SWCNT networks	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; TRANSPORT; ORIENTATION; COMPOSITES; MOBILITY	Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) networks have become a subject of interest due to their ability to support structural, thermal and electrical loadings, but to date their application has been hindered due, in large part, to the inability to model macroscopic responses in an industrial product with any reasonable confidence. This paper seeks to address the relationship between macroscale electrical conductivity and the nanostructure of a dense network composed of SWCNTs and presents a uniquely formulated physics-based computational model for electrical conductivity predictions. The proposed model incorporates physics-based stochastic parameters for the individual nanotubes to construct the nanostructure such as: an experimentally obtained orientation distribution function, experimentally derived length and diameter distributions, and assumed distributions of chirality and registry of individual CNTs. Case studies are presented to investigate the relationship between macroscale conductivity and nanostructured variations in the bulk stochastic length, diameter and orientation distributions. Simulation results correspond nicely with those available in the literature for case studies of conductivity versus length and conductivity versus diameter. In addition, predictions for the increasing anisotropy of the bulk conductivity as a function of the tube orientation distribution are in reasonable agreement with our experimental results. Examples are presented to demonstrate the importance of incorporating various stochastic characteristics in bulk conductivity predictions. Finally, a design consideration for industrial applications is discussed based on localized network power emission considerations and may lend insight to the design engineer to better predict network failure under high current loading applications.

In this paper, low-cost Ni catalysts supported on La-, Ce-, and Mg-promoted Al2O3 and ZrO2 were prepared and compared in terms of long-term catalytic activity, property stability, and coke-resistant ability for H-2 production from steam reforming (SR) of glycerol. The SR reactions were performed in a continuous fixed-bed reactor at 500 degrees C for 24 hours using 5 wt% glycerol as the feed. Techniques including XRD, N-2 adsorption/desorption, SEM/TEM, and TGA were applied for characterizing both the fresh and used catalysts. Results illustrate that prepared by two-impregnation mothed, the La, Ce, and Mg promoters effectively suppressed the strong interaction of Ni and Al2O3 to avoid NiAl2O4 formation during the preparation process. The modified Ni/Al2O3 catalysts contained very fine Ni crystals (5-8 nm) which greatly promoted the carbon gasification efficiency of the SR reaction from 3% without the use of a catalyst to 65-87%, with the H-2 yield increased from 0.5 to 3-5 mol/mol. The catalyzed gas products were composed of about 67% H-2 and 31% CO2. The La-promoted Ni/Al2O3 catalyst achieved the highest activity and the most stable crystalline structure for 24-hour reaction. The Ce-promoted Ni/ZrO2 catalyst obtained stable but much less carbon gasification efficiency (approximately 30%) due to its large Ni crystals (36 nm) over the bulk ZrO2 supports.

Numerous algorithms have been designed to perform tree-cover delineation in high-to-coarse-resolution satellite imagery, but most of them do not scale to terabytes of data, typical in these VHR data sets. In this paper, we present an automated probabilistic framework for the segmentation and classification of 1-m VHR data as obtained from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) for deriving tree-cover estimates for the whole of Continental United States, using a high-performance computing architecture. The results from the classification and segmentation algorithms are then consolidated into a structured prediction framework using a discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model based on conditional random field, which helps in capturing the higher order contextual dependence relations between neighboring pixels. Once the final probability maps are generated, the framework is updated and retrained by incorporating expert knowledge through the relabeling of misclassified image patches. This leads to a significant improvement in the true positive rates and reduction in false positive rates (FPRs). The tree-cover maps were generated for the state of California, which covers a total of 11 095 NAIP tiles and spans a total geographical area of 163 696 sq. miles. Our framework produced correct detection rates of around 88% for fragmented forests and 74% for urban tree-cover areas, with FPRs lower than 2% for both regions. Comparative studies with the National Land-Cover Data algorithm and the LiDAR high-resolution canopy height model showed the effectiveness of our algorithm for generating accurate high-resolution tree-cover maps.

The prepared samples were characterized by XRD, BET, SEM-EDX, TEM, NH3-TPD, FT-IR and Py-IR. The results indicate that Sn species were successfully incorporated into HZSM-5 zeolites. The catalytic performances of all prepared zeolites were evaluated by glycerol aromatization. The highest catalytic performance of GTA synthesis was observed with H[Sn, Al]ZSM-5 treated with 0.3 M NaOH (32.1% carbon yield of BTX aromatics and 13 h catalyst lifetime), which was prior to the pure HZSM-5 (17.8% carbon yield of BTX aromatics and 3 h catalyst lifetime). The remarkably improved performance in catalytic activity and stability of H[Sn, Al]ZSM-5/0.3AT zeolitize could be attributed to synergy effect between Sn species doped into HZSM-5 zeolite and the generated micro-mesoporous structure by alkali treatment (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report an ingenious strategy to load highly dense and monodisperse CuAg nanoalloys (NAs) on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) by blue laser (405 nm) -induced photochemical reaction. Without the aid of any complex auxiliary reagents, the co-reduction of Cu and Ag ions is driven by photon-excited electron on semiconductor h-BN, resulting in the coalescence and overgrowth of "clean" CuAg NAs. As expected, the proposed h-BN/CuAg NAs provide ultrahigh SERS activity with the limit of detections (LODs) of crystal violet (CV) at femtomole level (similar to 10(-16) M), thiram and tricyclazole at picomolar (10(-12) M) and nanomolar levels (10(-9 )M), respectively. Most importantly, the as-prepared h-BN/CuAg NAs were also directly combined with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by simple dripping and drying processes to form uniform flexible substrates. The low-cost Cu-based flexible substrates can be used to realize the ultrasensitive SERS detection of residual tricyclazole on tomato surfaces, thus facilitating the widespread precise assessment of pesticide residues in various practical applications.

J	Frey, HC; Li, S				Frey, HC; Li, S			Methods for quantifying variability and uncertainty in AP-42 emission factors: Case studies for natural gas-fueled engines	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							QUANTIFICATION; SIMULATION; NOX	Quantitative methods for characterizing variability and uncertainty were applied to case studies of oxides of nitrogen and total organic carbon emission factors for lean-, burn natural gas-fueled internal combustion engines. Parametric probability distributions were fit to represent inter-engine variability in specific emission factors. Bootstrap simulation was used to quantify uncertainty in the fitted cumulative distribution function and in the mean emission factor. Some methodological challenges were encountered in analyzing the data. For example, in one instance, five data points were available, with each data point representing a different market share. Therefore, an approach was developed in which parametric distributions were fitted to population-weighted data. The uncertainty in mean emission factors ranges from as little as similar to+/-10% to as much as -90 to + 180%. The wide range of uncertainty in some emission factors emphasizes the importance of recognizing and accounting for uncertainty in emissions estimates. The skewness in some uncertainty estimates illustrates the importance of using numerical simulation approaches that do not impose restrictive symmetry assumptions on the confidence interval for the mean. In this paper, the quantitative method, the analysis results, and key findings are presented.

The aim of the study was to optimize the production of surfactin from the xylose-rich corncob hydrolysate and low-cost residues rich in organic nitrogen using Bacillus subtilis BS-37.MethodsHydrolysis of corncob was carried out with 1.5% H2SO4, FHW or GMW was used as nitrogen source to produce surfactin. Sugar compositions of corncob hydrolysate and surfactin titer were determined by HPLC. The dry weight method was used to measure biomass in fermentation broth.ResultsWe discovered that the efficient surfactin producer B. subtilis BS-37 can use xylose as sole carbon source, but the addition of organic nitrogen sources was essential for surfactin production. Consequently, the xylose-rich corncob hydrolysate and low-cost residues rich in organic nitrogen were used to produce surfactin. Strain BS-37 was able to tolerate significant concentrations of several inhibitory compounds found in corncob hydrolysate, whereby acetic acid even enhanced surfactin production. Furthermore, NaOH-neutralized corncob hydrolysate was more suitable for surfactin production than the traditional Ca(OH)(2)-neutralized feedstock.ConclusionsWe achieved a maximal surfactin yield of 523mg/L from NaOH-neutralized corncob hydrolysate and feather hydrolysate waste. Furthermore, the product contained 55.3% of the most desirable surfactin isoform C-15. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of surfactin production with xylose as the main fermentable carbon source.

Development of low-temperature desulfurization performance of a MnO2/AC composite for a combined SO2 trap for diesel exhaust	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							ACTIVATED CARBON; SIMULTANEOUS REMOVAL; SULFUR-DIOXIDE; ADSORPTION; OXIDATION; REGENERATION; CATALYSTS; SORPTION; FILTER; FRESH	Growing concern about the removal of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from combustion exhaust has resulted in the development of desulfurization materials for a SO2 trap. In this study, a manganese dioxide/activated carbon (MnO2/AC) composite was proposed as a low temperature desulfurization material for a combined SO2 trap. The MnO2/AC composite was synthesized using a redox deposition method and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The SO2 adsorption capacity of the composites was measured using thermogravimetry and the SO2 adsorption characteristics were also investigated. In the low temperature region (50-200 degrees C), the MnO2/AC composite exhibits good SO2 trap performance and the MnO2 conversion of the composite is significantly improved. It was found that the SO2 adsorption on the MnO2/AC composite is a chemisorption process. The experimental data for SO2 adsorption on the MnO2/AC composite could fit the Freundlich model well. Changes in the thermodynamic parameters were determined. The calculated values of Delta G(0) and Delta H-0 indicate that the SO2 adsorption on the MnO2/AC composite is spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable.	[Liu, X. C.; Huang, H.

Hot and cold subduction systems in the Western Pacific Ocean: insights from heat flows	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Western Pacific; heat flow; inverse distance weighted; hot and cold subduction; dehydration; decarbonation; earthquake	SOUTHWEST JAPAN ARC; HIGH-PRESSURE; DEEP-SEA; CARBON; SERPENTINE; ZONES; EARTHQUAKES; SEISMICITY; MECHANISM; EVOLUTION	We calculate a predicted interpolating result of surface heat flow based on a data set with 2674 measurements in the Western Pacific. Comparisons of heat flow profiles between the back-arc basin and the corresponding subduction slab show that the cold subducting slab may cause indirectly the thermal activities of back-arc basins. We estimate that values of <50mW/m(2) for both the Philippine Sea Plate and the Pacific Plate may respectively cause the thermal activity of the Okinawa Trough and the Kuril Basin. Moreover, cold subduction may release carbonatitic liquid at different depths, and the process of releasing liquid ends up with the maximum range of serpentinization. The hot subduction system has released most of the water before being incorporated into the mantle wedge; therefore, at great depths, the amount of carbon may dominate the subducting process by controlling partial melting.

Here, we show that the selectivity for hydrogenation of Pd can be manipulated by altering the coor-dinate environment. PdNi/SiO2 dilute alloy nanocatalysts have been synthesized at room temperature, which show effectively the unparalleled catalytic performance (about 100% selectivity to styrene) for phenylacety-lene hydrogenation at 30 degrees C with full conversion. Structural and surface analyses show that the improvement in dispersion of the Pd active sites and the changed electronic structure of Pd contribute the catalytic perfor-mance significantly. This work is an important step towards developing highly active hydrogenation catalysts by forming dilute alloys.

So far, there is a lack of in-depth studies on the aqueous suspension of PEEK. In this study, two non-ionic surfactants were selected for compounding. Then PEEK aqueous suspension and continuous carbon fiber reinforced PEEK composites were prepared. The stability mechanism of PEEK aqueous suspension with different surfactants was analyzed. Studies have shown that in the PEEK aqueous suspension, Triton X-100 can help to infiltrate the PEEK powder. The steric hindrance of polyethylene glycol contributes to the stability of the suspension. The synergistic steric hindrance effect of the two surfactants can increase the stability time of PEEK suspension from 5 min to more than 50 min. The PEEK composites prepared by the powder slurry method has good quality stability, the fiber volume fraction is about 60%, the flexural strength of the composites can reach 1336 MPa, and the interlayer shear strength can reach 106 MPa. This study provides useful insights for the stability mechanism of PEEK aqueous suspension, and can guide the preparation process of thermoplastic composites by powder slurry method.

Improving the recycling rate of iron and steel slag has become an urgent problem to be solved by scholars and enterprises at home and abroad. Therefore, it is of great significance to continuously optimize the recycling process of iron and steel slag and waste heat recovery technology. By comparing and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of different granulation processes for iron and steel slag, the disadvantages of using dry or wet granulation processes alone for iron and steel slag are pointed out in this paper. Then, a combined granulation process mode combining dry and wet processes is proposed to improve the processing efficiency of molten slag. The increase in resource conversion rate and the quality of granulated slag after primary granulating of iron and steel slag contribute to reducing the amount of slag to be treated secondarily. Furthermore, the energy consumption and pollutant emissions of slag secondary treatment will be decreased as well. It is intended to provide a reference for slag treatment technology and slag utilization rate expansion in iron and steel enterprises.

NanI Sialidase, CcpA, and CodY Work Together To Regulate Epsilon Toxin Production by Clostridium perfringens Type D Strain CN3718	JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY			English	Article							CARBON CATABOLITE REPRESSION; INTRAVENOUS-INJECTION MODEL; GROUP-II INTRON; BACILLUS-SUBTILIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; BETA-TOXIN; POSITIVE REGULATION; BIOFILM FORMATION; VIRULENCE; DIFFICILE	Clostridium perfringens type D strains are usually associated with diseases of livestock, and their virulence requires the production of epsilon toxin (ETX). We previously showed (J. Li, S. Sayeed, S. Robertson, J. Chen, and B. A. McClane, PLoS Pathog 7:e1002429, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002429) that BMC202, a nanI null mutant of type D strain CN3718, produces less ETX than wild-type CN3718 does. The current study proved that the lower ETX production by strain BMC202 is due to nanI gene disruption, since both genetic and physical (NanI or sialic acid) complementation increased ETX production by BMC202. Furthermore, a sialidase inhibitor that interfered with NanI activity also reduced ETX production by wild-type CN3718. The NanI effect on ETX production was shown to involve reductions in codY and ccpA gene transcription levels in BMC202 versus wild-type CN3718. Similar to CodY, CcpA was found to positively control ETX production. A double codY ccpA null mutant produced even less ETX than a codY or ccpA single null mutant. CcpA bound directly to sequences upstream of the etx or codY start codon, and bioinformatics identified putative CcpA-binding cre sites immediately upstream of both the codY and etx start codons, suggesting possible direct CcpA regulatory effects. A ccpA mutation also decreased codY transcription, suggesting that CcpA effects on ETX production can be both direct and indirect, including effects on codY transcription. Collectively, these results suggest that NanI, CcpA, and CodY work together to regulate ETX production, with NanI-generated sialic acid from the intestines possibly signaling type D strains to upregulate their ETX production and induce disease. IMPORTANCE Clostridium perfringens NanI was previously shown to increase ETX binding to, and cytotoxicity for, MDCK host cells. The current study demonstrates that NanI also regulates ETX production via increased transcription of genes encoding the CodY and CcpA global regulators. Results obtained using single ccpA or codY null mutants and a ccpA codY double null mutant showed that codY and ccpA regulate ETX production independently of one another but that ccpA also affects codY transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and bioinformatic analyses suggest that both CodY and CcpA may directly regulate etx transcription. Collectively, results of this study suggest that sialic acid generated by NanI from intestinal sources signals ETX-producing C. perfringens strains, via CcpA and CodY, to upregulate ETX production and cause disease.

Martensite stainless steel was deposited on 45# steel by the 2 kW carbon dioxide laser. The influence of Ni/B contents on the performance of cladding layer was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and self-made coating shear strength test device. The results showed that the formation of austenite and the expanding gamma region could be promoted by the addition of Ni element. When the addition content of Ni was about 6%similar to 8%, the martensite stainless steel was between plasticity and fragility. And the martensite stainless steel was embrittlement while the content was decreased, plasticized with increased. The addition of B contents could promote the rise of slag and gas in the cladding process with the effect of Si. According to the characteristics of the laser cladding, a special high-strength ultra-low carbon laser-specific Fe-based alloy powder (16.05Cr-2.06Ni-0.07C-0.83Si-0.05B) was developed. The experimental results show that the forming layer had the advantages of high-strength and high bond strength.

Compared with aluminum electrodes, mild steel electrodes were more effective for the removal of sulfide, with a removal efficiency of over 90%. But during the treatment process, black color precipitate typical to iron(II) sulfides was produced. While aluminum electrodes were effective to eliminate the colority of the effluent, the removal efficiency of sulfide was lower than 12%. The mechanisms of the removal of chemical oxygen demand, ammonia, total organic carbon, sulfide and colority with the two soluble electrodes (mild steel and aluminum electrodes) were discussed in detail. In order to exert the predominance of different types of electrodes, the tannery wastewater was treated using mild steel electrodes first followed by the filter and finally by the aluminum electrodes, the elimination rates of chemical oxygen demand, ammonia, total organic carbon, sulfide and colority were 68.0%, 43.1%, 55.1%, 96.7% and 84.3%, respectively, with the initial concentrations 2413.1 mg/L, 223.4 mg/L, 1000.4 mg/L, 112.3 mg/L and 256 dilution times, respectively. The absorbance spectra and energy consumption during electrocoagulation process were also discussed.

With glycerol in the medium, the activity of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex at the key node of 2-oxoglutarate was depressed, more carbon flux distribution was directed to synthesize glutamate, the substrate of gamma-PGA, which led to overproducing of gamma-PGA, reached 31.7 g/l, compared to the original value of 26.7 g/l. When Tween-80 or DMSO was in the medium, the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase was stimulated, the branch flux from 2-oxoglutarate to glutamate was also enhanced due to the increasing of total flux from iso-citrate to 2-oxoglutarate, then a large amount of glutamate was produced, and formation of gamma-PGA was also improved, which was a different process compared with that of glycerol. Moreover, with the addition of Tween-80 or DMSO, cell membrane permeability was increased, which facilitated the uptake of extracellular substrates and the secretion of gamma-PGA by this strain; therefore, gamma-PGA production was further stimulated, and 34.4 and 32.7 g/l gamma-PGA were obtained, respectively. This work firstly employed additives to improve the biosynthesis of gamma-PGA and would be helpful in understanding the biosynthesis mechanism of gamma-PGA by Bacillus species deeply.

As a result, understanding their structural and electronic properties affecting electrochemical performance becomes crucial. The role of light elements, which are found in anode and cathode materials, in electrolytes and hence in the solid-electrolyte interphases, requires a special attention. Soft X-ray spectroscopies are particularly relevant to probe selectively light elements in complex environment. Here, the recent advances in the characterization of light elements in energy storage materials by soft X-ray spectroscopy and microscopy techniques are reviewed. After introducing the main X-ray spectroscopic methods and their application to ex situ/in situ/operando characterization of electrochemical processes, the role of light elements in the electrode for supercapacitors and Li/Na-ion storage applications is described. The characterization of electrolytes and related ion solvation is then briefly reviewed before describing how the formation and evolution of solid-electrolyte interphases can be monitored with these methods. Finally, major challenges and future opportunities for soft X-rays spectroscopy in the context of electrochemical energy storage are highlighted.

To monitor the seasonal cycle of the canopy photosynthesis from space, several remotely sensed indexes, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and leaf area index (LAI) have been implemented within the past decades. Recently, satellite-derived sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) has shown great potential of providing retrievals that are more related to photosynthesis process. However, the potentials of different canopy measurements have not been thoroughly assessed in the context of recent advances of new satellites and proposals of improved indexes. At 15 forested sites, we present a cross-platform intercomparison of one emerging remote sensing based index of phenology index (PI) and two SIF datasets against the conventional indexes such as NDVI, EVI, and LAI to capture the seasonal cycles of canopy photosynthesis. NDVI, EVI, LAI, and PI were calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements, while SIF were evaluated from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) observations. Results indicated that GOME-2 SIF was highly correlated with gross primary production (GPP) and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation during the growing seasons. The SIF-GPP relationship can generally be considered linear at the 16-day scale. Key phenological metrics such as start of the seasons and end of the seasons captured by SIF from GOME-2 and OCO-2 matched closely with photosynthesis phenology as inferred by GPP. However, the applications of OCO-2 SIF for phenological studies may be limited only for a small range of sites ( at site-level) due to a limited spatial sampling. Among the MODIS estimations, PI and NDVI provided most reliable predictions of start of growing seasons, while no indexes accurately captured the end of growing seasons. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, high ductility EGCs were prepared with the incorporation of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber and modified multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The compression, flexural and four-point bending tests were used to evaluate the mechanical behaviors of EGCs. The relationship between the ultimate tensile strain and the mid-span displacement was discussed. Meanwhile, the micro-structure and morphology of EGCs were researched using the field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM) analysis. The experimental result showed that the compressive and flexural strength of modified geopolymers containing 0.10% modified MWCNTs and 2.00% PVA fiber at curing age of 28d reached maximal value(38.43 MPa and 7.75 MPa). Meanwhile, the uniaxial tensile strain of EGCs also reached maximal value(8.02%), and the corresponding cracking strain, cracking stress and ultimate tensile stress were 0.08%, 2.00 MPa and 4.70 MPa, respectively. In addition, the computing result of ductility indexes and residual strength indexes were well related with corresponding requirements of the deal elastoplastic material. And the four-point bending test could be employed to evaluate the special mechanical properties of uniaxial tensile test. Most importantly, the mechanism of anti inferiority of EGCs was explained and analyzed from the point of view of microscopic perspective and mesoscopic perspective, and a new mechanism for the modification of PVA fiber and modified MMWCNTs was revealed.

A novel in-situ surface hydrogenation was developed to prepare hydrogenated N/TiO2-V-O in a continuous, high throughput diffusion flame aerosol reactor. The combined results of various characterization techniques confirmed the presence of EMSI between N and defective TiO2-V-O resulted in the enhanced electronic density of N nanoparticles. Both the modulated electronic structure of N and surface oxygen vacancies simultaneously promoted the activation of surface adsorbed carbon intermediates and facilitated the separation of photogenerated charges, eventually boosting the photocatalytic activity of N/TiO2-V-O. The optimized N/TiO2-V-O demonstrated a high quantum yield of 1.49% with high CH4 selectivity (81%), which rendered 5.8- and 1.2-fold enhancements over its counterparts of TiO2-V-O and N/TiO2. More significantly, the EMSI also played a critical role in preserving the surface metallic Pt-0 and oxygen vacancies, and in sustaining high activity of the Pt/TiO2-V-O, whereas rapid catalytic deactivation are observed for both TiO2-V-O and Pt/TiO2.

Recent studies indicate that environmental exposures, including urban and traffic-related air pollution, may shorten telomeres. Associations between exposure to household air pollution from solid fuel stoves and telomere length have not been evaluated. METHODS: Among 137 rural Chinese women using biomass stoves (mean =55 y of age), we measured 48-h personal exposures to fine particulate matter [PM <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)] and black carbon and collected oral DNA on up to three occasions over a period of 2.5 y. Relative telomere length (RTL) was quantified using a modified real-time polymerase chain reaction protocol. Mixed effects regression models were used to investigate the exposure-response associations between household air pollution and RTL, adjusting for key sociodemographic, behavioral, and environmental covariates. RESULTS: Women's daily exposures to air pollution ranged from 13-1,136 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5 (mean = 154) and 0.1-34 mu g/m(3) for black carbon (mean = 3.6). Natural cubic spline models indicated a mostly linear association between increased exposure to air pollution and shorter RTL, except at very high concentrations where there were few observations. We thus modeled the linear associations with all observations, excluding the highest 3% and 5% of exposures. In covariate-adjusted models, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure to black carbon (3.1 mu g/m(3)) was associated with shorter RTL [all observations: -0.27 (95% CI: -0.48, -0.06); excluding highest 5% exposures: -1.10 (95% CI: -1.63, -0.57)]. Further adjustment for outdoor temperature brought the estimates closer to zero [all observations: -0.15 (95% CI: -0.36, 0.06); excluding highest 5% exposures: -0.68 (95% CI: -1.26, -0.10)]. Models with PM2.5 as the exposure metric followed a similar pattern. CONCLUSION: Telomere shortening, which is a biomarker of biological aging and chronic disease, may be associated with exposure to air pollution in settings where household biomass stoves are commonly used.

The transect-quadrat sampling method was applied to sample the plant species and functional diversity and the aboveground plant biomass. Statistical package F-diversity v. 2011 was used to calculate the functional diversity index. OriginPro 9.0 drawing software was used to diagram 3-dimensional (longitudinal, latitudinal, and altitudinal) distribution patterns of plant diversity, plant biomass and environmental factors. Correlations among plant biomass, species diversity, functional diversity, and environmental factors were analyzed by using SPSS16.0. The results indicated that alpine steppe was the major vegetation type in high-altitude areas of the southwestern region of the AMNR, alpine wet meadow and alpine steppe were the major vegetation types in low altitude areas of the northeastern region of the AMNR. The vegetation types in mid-altitude areas of the northwestern region and low altitude areas of the southeastern region of the AMNR were primarily alpine desert. Plant species diversity and biomass did not vary significantly along latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal gradients. Plant species diversity was positively correlated with soil total nitrogen, total carbon, organic carbon, and moisture. The functional diversity of the plant community was positively correlated with precipitation and soil moisture. Vegetation biomass was positively correlated with soil total nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil moisture, whereas it was negatively correlated with soil bulk density. Plant species diversity was positively correlated with the functional diversity of the plant community. The integrated effects of geographic factors, soil factors, and meteorological conditions contributed to the spatial heterogeneity of species biodiversity and vegetation biomass of the plant communities in the AMNR, whereas the effects of soil and climatic factors were much stronger than those of geographical factors.

Properties of reaction products were analyzed by microcoulometry, gas-chromatography, Fourier transform-infrared spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction methods. Based on the experiments, composition of products, geochemical characteristics, and thermodynamics of natural gas-CaSO(4)-H(2)O system were compared with those of natural gas-MgSO(4)-H(2)O system. It was found that H(2)S, CO(2), and carbon were the common products of the two thermochemical sulfate reduction systems. In thermochemical sulfate reduction process, CaSO(4) was reduced to CaCO(3) while MgSO(4) was reduced to MgO. At the same reaction temperature, the effect of thermochemical sulfate reduction on natural gas was more intensified in natural gas-MgSO(4)-H(2)O system than natural gas-CaSO(4)-H(2)O system. With the same temperature and hydrocarbon, MgSO(4) more easily participates thermodynamically in the reactions than CaSO(4).

Understanding transparent exopolymer particle occurrence and interaction with algae, bacteria, and the fractions of natural organic matter in the Red Sea: implications for seawater desalination	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT			English	Article						Transparent exopolymer particles; Natural organic matter; Biofouling; Red Sea; Seawater reverse osmosis desalination	FEED WATER-QUALITY; BIOFILM FORMATION; SWRO FACILITIES; INTAKE SYSTEMS; TEP; PHYTOPLANKTON; PRETREATMENT; ABUNDANCE; POLYSACCHARIDE; AGGREGATION	Binding of particulate and dissolved organic matter in the water column by marine gels allows the sinking and cycling of organic matter into the deeper water of the Red Sea and other marine water bodies. A series of four offshore profiles were made at which concentrations of bacteria, algae, particulate transparent exopolymer particles (p-TEP), colloidal transparent exopolymer particles (c-TEP), and the fractions of natural organic matter (NOM), including biopolymers, humic substances, building blocks, low molecular weight (LMW) neutrals, and LMW acids were measured to depths ranging from 90 to 300 m. It was found that a statistically-significant relationship occurs between the concentrations of p-TEP with bacteria and algae, but not with total organic carbon (TOC) in the offshore profiles. Variation in the biopolymer fraction of NOM in relationship to TEP and bacteria suggests that extracellular discharges of polysaccharides and proteins from the bacteria and algae are occurring without immediate abiotic assembly into p-TEP. In the water column below the photic zone, TOC, bacteria, and biopolymers show a generally common rate of reduction in concentration, but p-TEP decreases at a diminished rate, showing that it persists in moving organic carbon deeper into the water column despite consumption by bacteria. The data presented herein are the first to link TEP concentrations in the Red Sea with the fractions of NOM as measured using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection (LCOCD) technology. The oceanographic and water quality investigations show the seawater used for reverse osmosis desalination from the nearshore or offshore would yield nearly equal treatment challenges. Use of deep water intake systems to obtain seawater with reduced p-TEP and bacteria concentrations would not significantly impact treatment if it would be feasible which is not.	[Dehwah, Abdullah H.

Thermally Stable and Tough Coatings and Films Using Vinyl Silylated Lignin	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Lignin; Reactive extrusion; Vinyl silylated lignin; Polyacrylonitrile; Copolymers; Films; Coatings	CARBON-FIBERS; CARBOXYMETHYLATED LIGNINS; POLYACRYLONITRILE; EMULSIONS; STABILIZATION	We modified lignin, a renewable biomacromolecule with high carbon density, with silicon-containing vinyl groups via a highly efficient silylation reaction that achieved similar to 30% substitution of lignin's hydroxyl units. This exothermic process was carried out in the melt state, in situ, in a reactive extruder. H-1, C-13, and P-31 NMR and FTIR confirmed the success of the silylation and were used to access the reactivity of the vinyl silylated lignin for copolymerization with polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Copolymers of the unmodified lignin and PAN were also produced as a reference. Importantly, the rheological behaviors of the copolymers of lignin and PAN were suitable for application in surface coating and films that were not possible if lignin or physical mixtures of lignin and PAN were used. Glass surfaces were treated via solution casting followed by oven drying, yielding films that were evaluated regarding their morphology (SEM) and thermal properties (TGA and DSC). The films produced with copolymers based on vinyl silylated lignin displayed a Young modulus of 486 MPa, an ultimate stress of 18 MPa, and a strain of 55% (DMA). These results indicate a much tougher system than that achieved after copolymerization of the unmodified lignin with PAN (ultimate stress and strain of less than 10 MPa and 10%, respectively). Overall, the introduced SiC and SiOC bonds improved lignin macromolecular mobility and facilitated its processability due to the remarkably low viscosity of the system. Our results show promising opportunities for lignin utilization as a precursor of copolymers, as illustrated here with PAN, for the synthesis of flexible films and other advanced materials.

Differential capacitance (C-d) is a key physical quantity to understand the EDL at electrode/ILs interfaces. In this work, we study the capacitance properties of 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMIM+/TESI-) and its mixture with 50 mol% 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) on glassy carbon electrode by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS spectrum shows both fast and slow capacitance processes, and C-d is attributed to the fast Debye process by fitting the full EIS spectrum. The C-d curve switches from bell-shape for neat IL to camel-shape for 50 mol% EMIM+/TESI /DME mixture, with much higher C-d over the whole electrochemical window for the latter. The measured C-d was further fitted by a mean-field theory (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 20 (2018) 17606-17614). Using the mean-field theory, we suggest that the higher Cd is caused by the reduced effective EDL screening length, which results from the reduced overscreening effect due to the weakened ionic correlations on adding DME.

In order to overcome these limitations, the author designed and studied a series of Mo:Fe(x)/HZSM-5 function catalyst with different ferromolybdenum ratios. The one-step process for preparing methyl acetal is realized in a fluidized bed reactor. The effect of different ferromolybdenum ratios on its catalytic performance was investigated and the optimum ferromolybdenum ratio catalyst was found. The results show that this new process and catalyst can overcome the disadvantages of traditional bifunctional catalysts and achieve a relatively high DMM yield. For instance, the methanol conversion ratio and DMM selectivity of the Mo:Fe(2)/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst reached 87.44% and 93%, respectively. Moreover, the recorded DMM yield was 81.32%, which was much higher than that of other research results. At the same time, the XPS catalyst activity and activation energy results show that increased molybdenum loading catalytic effect. However, when Mo/Fe > 2, the mutual promotion effect would be larger and part of the formaldehyde obtained by oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol would be further oxidized to obtain the by-product formic acid, further producing more methyl formate. In addition, the self-made Mo:Fe(2)/HZSM-5 dual-functional catalyst exhibits high stability and carbon deposition resistance under severe operating conditions, compared to other bifunctional catalysts of this process.

This chart scheme is based on the sample ranges of smallest extreme value distributions derived from Weibull processes. We suggest one-sided (high-side or low-side) and two-sided charts, which are unbiased with respect to the average run length (ARL). The control limits for all types of charts depend on the sample size, the number of failures c under type II censoring, the desired stable-process ARL, and the stable-process value of beta. This article also considers sample size requirements for phase I in retrospective charts. We investigate the effect of c on the out-of-control ARL. We discuss a simple approach to choosing c by cost minimization. The proposed schemes are then applied to data on the breaking strengths of carbon fibers. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium BL-27 was isolated from petroleum-polluted soil and was compounded with surfactants to improve biodegradation. Its 16S rDNA and rpoD gene sequences indicated that it was a strain of Bacillus subtilis. Strain BL-27 had extensive adaptability and degradability within a broad range of temperatures (25-50 degrees C), pH (4.0-10.0) and salinity (0-50 g/L NaCl). Under optimal conditions (45 degrees C, pH 7.0, 1% NaCl), the strain was able to degrade 65% of crude oil (0.3%, w/v) within 5 days using GC-MS analysis. Notably, strain BL-27 had weak cell surface hydrophobicity. The adherence rate of BL-27 to n-hexadecane was 29.6% with sucrose as carbon source and slightly increased to 33.5% with diesel oil (0.3%, w/v) as the sole carbon source, indicating that the cell surface of BL-27 is relatively hydrophilic. The strain was tolerant to SDS, Tween 80, surfactin, and rhamnolipids at a concentration of 500 mg/L. The cell surface hydrophobicity reduced more with the addition of surfactants, while the chemical dispersants, SDS (50-100 mg/L) and Tween 80 (200-500 mg/L), significantly increased the strain's ability to biodegrade, reaching 75-80%. These results indicated that BL-27 has the potential to be used for the bioremediation of hydrocarbon pollutants and could have promising applications in the petrochemical industry.

However, the presence of robust inter-unit carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds in natural lignin seriously impedes this process. Herein, for the first time, we report the selective cleavage of C-C bonds in beta-O-4 and beta-1 linkages catalyzed by cheap copper and a base to yield aromatic acids and phenols in excellent yields in water at 30 degrees C under air without the need for additional complex ligands. Isotope-labeling experiments show that a base-mediated C-beta-H bond cleavage is the rate-determining step for C-alpha-C-beta bond cleavage. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the oxidation of beta-O-4 ketone to a key intermediate, i.e., a peroxide, by copper and O-2 lowers the C-alpha-C-beta bond dissociation energy and facilitates its subsequent cleavage. In addition, the catalytic system could be successfully applied to the depolymerization of various authentic lignin feedstocks, affording excellent yields of aromatic compounds and high selectivity of a single monomer. This study offers the potential to economically produce aromatic chemicals from biomass.

Therefore, in order to explore the trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services in Ulansuhai Basin, we first evaluated the spatio-temporal characteristics of five ecosystem services in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018 based on the InVEST model, including soil conservation, carbon storage, water production, water purification, and food supply. We then further analyzed the trade-offs and synergies of ecosystem services in Ulansuhai Basin and in different functional areas through using the Spearman correlation coefficient. The results show that different ecosystem services had obvious regional differences due to different land-use types in Ulansuhai Basin. Soil conservation, carbon storage, and water production were higher in the eastern region and lower in the central and western regions, while water purification and food supply were higher in the central region and lower in the eastern and western regions. Ecosystem services showed an overall increasing trend from 2000 to 2018. Moreover, trade-off was the dominant relationship between different ecosystem services, and trade-offs and synergies showed strengthening trends to a certain extent. The trade-offs and synergies of ecosystem services in different functional areas were obviously different. Our study aimed to clarify the trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services and to propose ecological protection and management countermeasures and suggestions, which can provide decision-making reference for regional ecological protection and management.

We use organic petrology and organic geochemistry methods to make a systematic study on the relationship between petrological type, organic component content, hydrocarbon-generating potential, total organic carbon (TOC) and oil yield of the oil shale, basing on the results, the corresponding evaluation indexes are proposed. The results show that lithologic types and industrial grade of oil shales can be categorized as follows: videlicet, the content of organic component lower than 5%, between 5% and 15%, between 15% and 25%, and over 25% correspond to non-oil shale, low-quality, medium-quality, and high-quality oil shale. The total content of organic components, hydrocarbon-generating potential, TOC and oil yield correlate significantly with each other, so they can be easily used as indexes to evaluate the industrial grade of oil shale. For example, the coefficient R between organic carbon content of oil shale and oil content is 0.978, the oil yield 3.5% corresponds to the TOC 7.5%, the oil yield 5% corresponds to the TOC 9.5%, and 10% to the TOC 17.0%.

A case study into the measurement of ship emissions from plume intercepts of the NOAA ship Miller Freeman	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							AEROSOL MASS-SPECTROMETER; LIGHT-ABSORPTION MEASUREMENTS; PARTICULATE MATTER EMISSIONS; PARTICLE SOOT PHOTOMETER; BLACK CARBON; COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTERIZATION; AIRCRAFT INSTRUMENT; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; DIESEL-ENGINES; MARINE VESSEL	Emissions factors (EFs) for gas and sub-micron particle-phase species were measured in intercepted plumes as a function of vessel speed from an underway research vessel, the NOAA ship Miller Freeman, operating a medium-speed diesel engine on low-sulfur marine gas oil (fuel sulfur content similar to 0.1% by weight). The low-sulfur fuel in use conforms to the MARPOL fuel sulfur limit within emission control areas set to take effect in 2015 and to California-specific limits set to take effect in 2014. For many of the particle-phase species, EFs were determined using multiple measurement methodologies, allowing for an assessment of how well EFs from different techniques agree. The total sub-micron PM (PM1) was dominated by particulate black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM), with an average POM/BC ratio of 1.3. Consideration of the POM/BC ratios observed here with literature studies suggests that laboratory and in-stack measurement methods may overestimate primary POM EFs relative to those observed in emitted plumes. Comparison of four different methods for black carbon measurement indicates that careful attention must be paid to instrument limitations and biases when assessing EFBC. Particulate sulfate (SO42-) EFs were extremely small and the particles emitted by Miller Freeman were inefficient as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), even at high super saturations, consistent with the use of very low-sulfur fuel and the overall small emitted particle sizes. All measurement methodologies consistently demonstrate that the measured EFs (fuel mass basis) for PM1 mass, BC and POM decreased as the ship slowed. Particle number EFs were approximately constant across the speed change, with a shift towards smaller particles being emitted at slower speeds. Emissions factors for gas-phase CO and formaldehyde (HCHO) both increased as the vessel slowed, while EFs for NOx decreased and SO2 EFs were approximately constant.	[Cappa, C. D.; Buffaloe, G.

People may lack GLA because of aging or diseases, and thus, dietary supplements or medical reagents containing GLA-enriched lipids are in demand. Cunninghamella echinulata is a potential GLA-producing strain. Interestingly, we found that the GLA content of C. echinulata FR3 was up to 21% (proportion of total lipids) when trehalose was used as a carbon source, significantly higher than the 13% found when glucose was used. Trehalose is quite common and can be accumulated in microorganisms under stress conditions. However, little information is available regarding the role of trehalose in GLA synthesis and accumulation. Our study aimed to understand how the metabolism of C. echinulata responds to trehalose as a carbon source for GLA and lipid biosynthesis. We profiled the major sugars, fatty acids, phospholipids, and gene transcripts of C. echinulata FR3 grown in trehalose medium with glucose as a control by de novo transcriptomics, lipidomics, and other methods. The results showed that trehalose could influence the expression of desaturases and that the GLA proportion increased because of delta-6 desaturase upregulation. The increased GLA was transferred to the extracellular environment through the active PI ion channel, which prefers polyunsaturated acyl chains. At the same time, trehalose might prevent GLA from peroxidation by forming a trehalose-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) complex. Our study provides new insights into the functions of trehalose in GLA accumulation.

The results showed that non-linear plastic-elastic behaviour under load lower than cold modulus of rupture (CMOR) was registered in all samples and real linear elastic behavior can be identified after first load. The total deformation can be divided into two parts, plastic and elastic areas.

J	Li, S; Jin, HG; Gao, L; Zhang, XS				Li, Sheng; Jin, Hongguang; Gao, Lin; Zhang, Xiaosong			Exergy analysis and the energy saving mechanism for coal to synthetic/substitute natural gas and power cogeneration system without and with CO2 capture	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Applied Energy (ICAE)	JUL 01-04, 2013	Pretoria, SOUTH AFRICA			Exergy analysis; Synthetic/substitute natural gas; IGCC/polygeneration; Carbon capture and storage; Energy saving mechanism	SNG PRODUCTION; PROCESS DESIGN; GASIFICATION; BIOMASS; METHANATION; INTEGRATION; SECTOR	The energy saving mechanism and the potential of efficiency improvement for coal to synthetic/substitute natural gas and power plant with different schemes and CO2 capture is disclosed through exergy analysis, and the effects of key parameters on exergy losses and system performance are investigated. Scheme A represents the system without CO2 capture but with a full syngas component adjustment and partial recycle of the chemical unconverted gas, Scheme B represents the system without CO2 capture and syngas component adjustment but with partial recycle of the chemical unconverted gas, and Scheme C represents the SNG and power cogeneration with CO2 capture and partial recycle of the chemical unconverted gas but without syngas component adjustment. Results show that the exergy efficiencies of Scheme A, B and C range from 56% to 62%, 57% to 67%, 52% to 62%, respectively. Coal gasification, water-gas-shift process, SNG methanation, and fuel combustion in combined cycle are identified as the main sources of exergy losses. Compared with Scheme A, the exergy efficiency of Scheme B is higher due to the avoidance of exergy losses from syngas adjustment. Scheme C is less energy efficient than Scheme B because of the CO2 capture. Compared with single product systems, the total exergy input of Scheme A, B and C can be reduced by 7.0-11.0%, 14.0-19.0%, 15.0-21.0%, respectively assuming the same product output. The chemical to power output ratio (CPOR) will impact the exergy losses of the whole plant greatly. For all schemes, with the increasing CPOR, the exergy losses for chemical synthesis island will increase whereas the exergy losses for power island will decrease. Especially high CPOR will cause sharp exergy losses of chemical synthesis island. The coupling between exergy losses for chemical synthesis and power islands leads to an optimal CPOR making the total exergy losses of the plant minimal and the system efficiency maximized. The results presented in this paper can help to confirm the potential of system integration and can be a guide for system integration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A 7-yr field experiment was conducted to exploit the optimal integrated straw-return and tillage strategy for maintaining soil quality and sustaining crop productivity in an intensive wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system in the Guanzhong Plain. Three strategies were tested for wheat: straw harvest (Wh), straw return with chopped straw distribution on soil surface (Wr) and with stubble 30-40 cm height (Ws); three strategies were for maize: straw harvest with rotary tillage (Mh), straw return with rotary tillage (Mr) and with subsoiling (Ms). Thus, nine integrated strategies were conducted per rotation period: WhMh, WhMr, WhMs, WrMh, WrMr, WrMs, WsMh, WsMr, and WsMs. The results indicated that the eight integrated strategies (except WhMh) promoted both wheat and maize grain yields, and showed the largest increase for the system productivity (+42.3%) and sustainable yield index (+43.0%) under WsMs relative to the WhMh. In addition, significant increases were observed in various soil quality indicators under integrated strategies, especially under WsMs. The system productivity responses were predominately determined by mean weight diameter, soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, and available phosphorus. Therefore, the integrated strategies of wheat straw return with stubble 30-40 cm height and maize straw return with subsoiling can be advised for maintaining soil quality and improving crop productivity in the wheat-maize cropping system in the long term.

The aim of this work is to identify the energy saving potentials of different CO2 separation technical measures from the level of thermodynamic principles. The energy saving mechanism of these two technical measures is investigated through analysis of energy consumption and exergy destruction distributions and further disclosed by the Energy Utilization Diagram (EUD) method. The results indicate that the relative importance of absorbent innovation and process upgrading will change for emission sources with different CO2 concentrations. Absorbent innovation is more sensible for emission sources with higher CO2 concentrations, while the role of process upgrading will be enhanced for low-concentration sources. Moreover, absorbent innovation can affect the reboiler duty from the perspective of both energy quantity and energy quality, while process upgrading mainly affects the energy amount of the reboiler duty. Through comparison of diverse absorbents, the results indicate that the field is still in the key stage of absorbent innovation for current chemical absorption technology. Upon transition to lower reboiler (<2.5) duty and lower IAP (<1.5), process upgrading can be expected to be a more effective and faster way to save energy than absorbent innovation.

J	Zhu, XC; Shi, YX; Li, S; Cai, NS				Zhu, Xuancan; Shi, Yixiang; Li, Shuang; Cai, Ningsheng			Two-train elevated-temperature pressure swing adsorption for high-purity hydrogen production	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Elevated-temperature pressure swing adsorption; Potassium-promoted layered double oxide; Hydrogen production; Shifted gas	WATER-GAS-SHIFT; GASIFICATION COMBINED-CYCLE; CO2 CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY; CARBON CAPTURE; PROMOTED HYDROTALCITE; BIOMASS GASIFICATION; ACTIVATED CARBON; SEWGS PROCESS; H-2-RICH GAS; H-2 RECOVERY	The trade-off between hydrogen recovery ratio (HRR) and hydrogen purity (HP) is one of the main drawbacks in normal temperature pressure swing adsorption (NT-PSA) for producing high-purity hydrogen from shifted gas. In this paper, a two-train elevated-temperature pressure swing adsorption (ET-PSA) process that achieved 99.999% HP and over 95% HRR is proposed, which has wide application potentials in fuel cells and chemical industries. Potassium-promoted layered double oxide (K-LDO), which shows reasonable working capacity and fast adsorption/desorption kinetics at elevated temperatures (200-450 degrees C), is adopted as the CO2 adsorbent. CO in the shifted gas is co-purified by high-temperature water gas shift (WGS) catalysts added to the columns. The first train ET-PSA adopted an eight-column thirteen-step configuration with shorter step time to remove most of the CO/CO2 in the shifted gas, and the second-train ET-PSA adopted a double-column seven-step configuration with longer step time to purify the residual gas impurities. The introduction of co-current high-pressure steam rinse and counter-current low-pressure steam purge is the key to achieve both high HRR and HP. The high-temperature steam is the main energy consumption of ET-PSA rather than low HRR in NT-PSA, and the total steam consumption is reduced by adopting the tail gas from second-train ET-PSA as the purge gas for first-train ET-PSA. The optimal results achieved 97.51% HRR and 99.9994% HP with only 0.188 rinse-to-feed ratio and 0.263 purge-to-feed ratio, which are the highest values reported for PSAs producing high-purity hydrogen from carbon based fuels.

Herein, a hollow-structured bimetallic zeolitic imidazole framework composed of Zn and Co as metal centers (H-ZnCo-ZIF) has been successfully prepared via a post-synthetic strategy based on controllable chemical-etching of the preformed solid ZnCo-ZIF in tannic acid. The creation of hollow cavities inside each monocrystalline ZIFs could be achieved without destroying the intrinsic frameworks, as characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction technologies. The as-synthesized H-ZnCo-ZIF exhibited remarkable catalytic activity in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides to the corresponding cyclic carbonates, outperforming the solid ZnCo-ZIF analogue due to the improved mass transfer originating from the hollow structure. More importantly, due to stabilization of metal centers in the ZIF framework by the tannic acid shell, H-ZnCo-ZIF exhibited good recyclability, and no activity loss could be observed in six runs. The present study provides a simple and effective strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of ZIFs by creating a hollow structure via chemical etching.

Still, challenges remain in the fabrication of solar evaporation devices with synergistic performance in a scalable fashion. Herein, we develop a scalable fabrication process involving multi-scale and multi-interface engineering to achieve high- performance and large-area solar evaporation devices. At nanoscale, light-absorbing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are complexed with hydrophilic cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) to form the nanocomposite inks of CNT-CNF (c-CNT) with tunable viscosity for doctor blading on ethanol-diffused polystyrene (E-PS) films. Through one-step thermal treatment, device shrinkage and substrate foaming are triggered at multi-interfaces to synchronously induce (1) the creation of microscale crumpled c-CNT textures with dual-improved water supply and light absorption and (2) the generation of mesoscale pores in PS substrates with dual-suppressed thermal conduction and radiation. Contributed by the synergistic designs, the solar evaporation device demonstrates a high evaporation rate of 1.41 kg m(-2) h(-1) and a conversion efficiency of 95.8% at an extremely low loading of photothermal materials (0.25 mg cm(-2) ). A large-area solar evaporation panel is realized to highlight the practical consideration toward more impactful solar evaporation exploitation.

MYB61, a transcriptional factor that regulates cellulose synthesis, is directly regulated by a known NUE regulator GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR4 (GRF4), which coordinates cellulosic biomass production and N utilization. The variation at MYB61 has been selected during indica and japonica domestication. The indica allele of MYB61 displays robust transcription resulting in higher NUE and increased grain yield at reduced N supply than that of japonica. Our study hence unravels how C metabolism is linked to N uptake and may provide an opportunity to reduce N use for sustainable agriculture.

J	Wang, Y; Li, JH; Deng, J; Li, S				Wang, Yi; Li, Junhui; Deng, Jun; Li, Song			Bond behaviour of CFRP/steel strap joints exposed to overloading fatigue and wetting/drying cycles	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES			English	Article						CFRP; Bond behaviour; Overloading fatigue; Wetting/drying cycles; Durability	METALLIC BEAMS; ENVIRONMENTAL DURABILITY; FRP/STEEL JOINTS; STEEL MEMBERS; CFRP PLATES; CARBON; FRP; CORROSION; STRENGTH; MOISTURE	Carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) has been widely used in strengthening of deficient steel structures in subtropical regions following their application in concrete structure rehabilitation. However, after the strengthening, both hygrothermal conditions and overloading fatigue can further promote the mechanical degradation of the strengthened structures, and the tendency remains unclear. Therefore, to predict the service life of steel structures after CFRP strengthening, the bond behaviour of CFRP-strengthened steel plates that are affected by overloading fatigue damage and/or wetting/drying cycles (WDCs) with 3.5 wt% NaCl solution was investigated in this study. In total, 12 CFRP/steel strap joints were tested in six cases, where six specimens experienced overloading damage by axial fatigue tensile loading. Then, both specimens with and without pre damage were exposed to WDCs (0, 90 and 180). After WDC exposure, the tensile tests were conducted. The load strain curves, tensile-bearing capacities, failure modes and interfacial stress distributions were obtained. As observed, with increasing WDCs, the strength of the overloading fatigue-damaged specimens continuously decreased. However, the strength of the specimens without overloading damage decreased during the first 90 WDCs and then slightly increased during the next 90 WDCs. In addition, a simple expression of the maximum interfacial principle stress at the gap location of the CFRP/steel strap joints was developed. A model based on the maximum stress was proposed to evaluate the long-term bond strength degradation of CFRP-strengthened steel structures under overloading fatigue and/or WDC conditions, and good consistency was reached with the test results.

It was found that two types of martensite transformation mechanism, stress-assisted and strain-induced, occurred via the sequences of gamma (fee) -> epsilon (hcp) -> alpha' (bcc) and/or gamma -> alpha'. In both cases, the crystallographic relationships among gamma, epsilon, and alpha' followed the Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationships: {111}(gamma)//{0001}(epsilon)//{011}(alpha') and < 110 >//< 11 (2) over bar0 >(epsilon)//<(1) over bar 11 >(alpha').

Alternatively, spirocyclopentane oxindoles containing an enaminone moiety can be achieved using the same starting materials, isatin-derived enals, and N-sulfonyl ketimines, in the presence of a slightly different NHC catalytic system. This switchable annulation strategy enables the selective assembly of both heterocyclic scaffolds with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities for a broad range of substrates.

Using pachymaran as the sole carbon source resulted in an endo-beta-1,3-glucanase activity of 86.1 U/mL and an E-endo/E-total ratio of 0.43, which were 3.2 and 1.65 folds of the values from control (glucose as the sole carbon source), due to the inductive effect of pachymaran as a polysaccharide. However, the cell concentration decreased from 25 to 12 g/L during the late fermentation phase. Therefore, a novel multi-stage feeding strategy was developed wherein glucose was fed twice during the cell logarithmic growth phase (24 and 48 h) and pachymaran once during the early stage of the enzyme accumulation phase (72 h). Consequently, the cell concentration remained around 30 g/L during the late fermentation phase. Endo-beta-1,3-glucanase activity and E-endo/E-total reached 160.0 U/mL and 0.76, respectively, which were 6.0 and 2.92 folds of the values from control. In addition, three typical polysaccharides with beta-1,3-linked glucose residues were successfully hydrolyzed by endo-beta-1,3-glucanase to produce multifunctional beta-1,3-oligoglucosides.

Combustion kinetics of the compound with n = 3, POMDME3 [CH3O(CH2O)(3)CH3], was investigated in the present study with combined experimental and modeling efforts. Twenty-six species, including some radicals and reactive intermediates, were identified and quantified in a low-pressure laminar premixed POMDME 3 flame with a synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry. Laminar burning velocities of POMDME3/air mixtures were measured in a spherical bomb at atmospheric pressure with the equivalence ratio ranging from 0.7 to 1.6. A kinetic model aimed at interpreting the high-temperature combustion chemistry of POMDME3 was constructed and tested by all the measurements with uncertainties of both experiments and model predictions taken into consideration. In addition, model analysis of the reaction pathways was performed to reveal the consumption processes of POMDME3 and the formation mecha-nisms of some crucial intermediates. The absence of carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds in the (C-O) chain structure results in significant soot-reduction potential. Relevant reaction patterns could also apply to larger POMDME compounds.

Starting from diphenyl sulfide, a preparative synthesis was developed for 'S-3'-H-2 ['S-3'-H-2 = bis(2-mercaptophenyl) sulfide]. Reactions of 'S-3'-H-2 or anionic 'S-3'(2-) with nickel and platinum precursors resulted in the formation of binuclear [Ni('S-3')](2) (1) and trinuclear [Pt('S-3')](3) (5) Complex 1 was cleaved by PMe3 or CN- to give the mononuclear complexes [Ni('S-3')(PMe3)] (2) and NMe4[Ni('S-3')(CN)] (3). Attempts to coordinate hydride to the [Ni('S-3')] fragment led to C-S bond cleavage of the ligand and formation of (NMe4)(2)[{Ni(mu-SC6H5) (S2C6H4)}(2)] (4). Oxidative addition of Li['S-3'-H] to [Pt(PPh3)(4)] afforded the platinum hydride complexes Li[Pt(H)('S-3')] and Li[Pt(H)(PPh3)('S-3')] which, however, could not be separated from each other and yielded [Pt('S-3')(PPh3)] (6) when treated with MeOH. In order to investigate electronic effects of the donor set, the 'S-3' ligand was modified by alkylation of one thiol group to give 'RS3'-H derivatives (R = Me, Et, Cy) and by replacing a mercaptophenyl unit by an amine in 'Et2NS2'-H ['Et2NS2'-H = N,N-diethyl-2-(2-mercaptothiophenyl)ethylamine]. Reactions of Ni-II or Ni-0 compounds with these ligands in a 1:1 ratio yielded the 1:2 complexes [Ni('MeS3')(2)] (7), [Ni('EtS3')(2)] (9) and [Ni('CyS3')(2)] (10), with 'RS3'(-) acting as bidentate ligands only Complex 7 reversibly reacted with PMe3 to form cis-[Ni(PMe3)(2)('MeS3')(2)] (8), exhibiting monodentate 'MeS3' ligands. [Ni('Et2HNS2')(2)]Br-2 (11) reacted reversibly with bases to presumably give octahedral [Ni('Et2NS2')(2)]. Complexes 7, 9 and 10 also did not yield any [Ni('RS3')(H)] hydride complex when treated with hydride sources. Oxidative addition of 'CyS3'-H to [Pt(PPh3)(4)] yielded the hydride complexes [Pt(H) ('CyS3')] and [Pt(H)(PPh3)('CyS3')] which, however, formed an inseparable mixture and underwent C-S bond cleavage when heated, affording [Pt(o-S2C6H4)(PPh3)(2)] The molecular structures of 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 11 were determined by X-ray crystallography, revealing butterfly-like shapes for the [MS3L] cores of the complexes.

In order to improve boiler thermal efficiency and to reduce NOx emission, the influencing factors including the overall excessive air ratio, the secondary air distribution pattern, the damper openings of CCOFA and SOFA, and pulverized coal fineness were investigated. Through comprehensive combustion adjustment, NOx emission decreased 182 ppm (NOx reduction efficiency was 44%), and boiler heat efficiency merely decreased 0.21%.

Traditionally used macroscopic parameters (e.g., initial, irreducible, mobile and clay bound water saturations) are not sufficient to describe the microdistribution characteristics and mobility of pore water in the complex porous shale matrix. In this paper, a new classification was proposed in which the pore water is composed of adsorbed and free parts, of which the latter is subdivided into capillary bound and mobile water. The components of pore water have the following features: during the centrifugation process, (a) adsorbed water is essentially immobile, while free water is potentially mobile; (b) capillary bound water is gradually transformed into mobile water with increased centrifugal pressure difference; and (c) the maximum mobile water amount is numerically equal to the free water amount. Based on the classification, an effective technique, which integrates centrifugation, water imbibition and low temperature nitrogen adsorption methods with the modified Li's adsorption ratio equation (2018), was established to quantitatively evaluate the microdistribution characteristics (adsorbed and free amounts and their ratios) and the mobility (mobile amount, potential and capacity) of pore water in marine shales from the southern Sichuan basin in China. Furthermore, the mechanism of controlling the microdistribution and mobility of pore water is analyzed with respect to the microscopic pore structure characteristics and material compositions of shales. The primary results demonstrate that (1) adsorbed and free water amounts obtained by centrifugation tests range from 5.145 to 31.282 mg/g (adsorbed) and from 7.880 to 49.751 mg/g (free); the weight ratio of adsorbed water is 0.268-0.629. (2) The mobile potential and mobile capacity of pore water are represented by the free water amount and mid-value pressure difference, respectively. A positive relationship between these two parameters occurs in the studied shales. (3) Pore microstructure characteristics of shale mainly impact the microdistribution and mobility of pore water in the shale matrix. The adsorbed water amount is closely associated with the specific surface area of pores, while the free and mobile water amounts are controlled by the pore volume. The ratios of adsorbed and free water depend on the size and morphology of pores for certain state parameters. The mobile ratio is impacted by pore complexity, which indicates that as the complexity increases, the mobile ratio decreases. The study provides significant insight into the microdistribution and mobility of pore water in gas shale matrix.

Formation of gas-phase carbonyls from heterogeneous oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids at the air-water interface and of the sea surface microlayer	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							ACTIVE ORGANIC MATERIAL; H-ATOM TRANSFER; OLEIC-ACID; MARINE ATMOSPHERE; AEROSOL-PARTICLES; ALKOXY RADICALS; REACTIVE UPTAKE; KIDNEY-CELLS; OZONE; PRODUCTS	Motivated by the potential for reactive heterogeneous chemistry occurring at the ocean surface, gas-phase products were observed when a reactive sea surface microlayer (SML) component, i.e. the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) linoleic acid (LA), was exposed to gas-phase ozone at the air-seawater interface. Similar oxidation experiments were conducted with SML samples collected from two different oceanic locations, in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and from the west coast of Canada. Online proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) University of Colorado light-emitting diode cavity-enhanced differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LED-CE-DOAS) were used to detect oxygenated gas-phase products from the ozonolysis reactions. The LA studies indicate that oxidation of a PUFA monolayer on seawater gives rise to prompt and efficient formation of gas-phase aldehydes. The products are formed via the decomposition of primary ozonides which form upon the initial reaction of ozone with the carbon-carbon double bonds in the PUFA molecules. In addition, two highly reactive dicarbonyls, malondialdehyde (MDA) and glyoxal, were also generated, likely as secondary products. Specific yields relative to reactant loss were 78 %, 29 %, 4% and < 1% for n-hexanal, 3-nonenal, MDA and glyoxal, respectively, where the yields for MDA and glyoxal are likely lower limits. Heterogeneous oxidation of SML samples confirm for the first time that similar carbonyl products are formed via ozonolysis of environmental samples.

Mossbauer spectroscopy and XRD revealed that the oxygenation of both alpha- and beta-polymorphs of FePc was successfully achieved. New Mossbauer spectral components (doublets) appeared upon the oxygenation in both alpha and beta FePc.

It is shown that RAFT polymerization can be used to carry out this crosslinking process, with the additional possibility to extend the reaction time from a few minutes as with classical free radical polymerization (FRP) to several hours. Higher control on viscosity and processability of the synthesized networks, as well as, the implementation of semibatch feed policies during crosslinking are important advantages of the RAFT process here explored comparatively to the FRP inverse vulcanization. Using cyclic voltammetry, it was assessed the electrochemical activity of the synthesized sulfur-rich polymer networks. It is shown that the fundamental electrochemical activity of the elemental sulfur was preserved in the produced materials. Testing of electrochemical cells assembled with lithium in the anode and different sulfur based materials in the cathode, including the synthesized RAFT networks, is also shown. The results here presented highlight the new opportunities introduced by reversible-deactivation radical polymerization mechanisms on the control of the synthesis process and in the design of such advanced materials and show also that many potential derivatizing possibilities can be achieved.

Reactive uptake of ammonia to secondary organic aerosols: kinetics of organonitrogen formation	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							BROWN CARBON FORMATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; PARTICULATE MATTER; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ALPHA-PINENE; CHEMICAL-CHARACTERIZATION; HETEROGENEOUS REACTIONS; MOLECULAR COMPOSITION; ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS	As a class of brown carbon, organonitrogen compounds originating from the heterogeneous uptake of NH3 by secondary organic aerosol (SOA) have received significant attention recently. In the current work, particulate organonitrogen formation during the ozonolysis of alpha-pinene and the OH oxidation of m-xylene in the presence of ammonia (34-125 ppb) was studied in a smog chamber equipped with a high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer and a quantum cascade laser instrument. A large diversity of nitrogen-containing organic (NOC) fragments was observed which were consistent with the reactions between ammonia and carbonyl-containing SOA. Ammonia uptake coefficients onto SOA which led to organonitrogen compounds were reported for the first time, and were in the range of similar to 10(-3)-10(-2), decreasing significantly to <10(-5) after 6 h of reaction. At the end of experiments (similar to 6 h) the NOC mass contributed 8.9 +/- 1.7 and 31.5 +/- 4.4 wt% to the total alpha-pineneand m-xylene-derived SOA, respectively, and 4-15 wt% of the total nitrogen in the system. Uptake coefficients were also found to be positively correlated with particle acidity and negatively correlated with NH3 concentration, indicating that heterogeneous reactions were responsible for the observed NOC mass, possibly limited by liquid phase diffusion. Under these conditions, the data also indicate that the formation of NOC can compete kinetically with inorganic acid neutralization. The formation of NOC in this study suggests that a significant portion of the ambient particle associated N may be derived from NH3 heterogeneous reactions with SOA. NOC from such a mechanism may be an important and unaccounted for source of PM associated nitrogen. This mechanism may also contribute to the medium or long-range transport and wet/dry deposition of atmospheric nitrogen.

However, they exhibit poor electronic conductivity and structural stability. Herein, the dual-phase (Pmn2(1,) and Pn) coexisting Li2Mn1-xNixSiO4@C is prepared successfully via a two-step calcination process to address the aforementioned problems. The orthorhombic Pmn2(1) and Pn phase are expected to bring well solid-state Li diffusion properties (D-Li(+)) and structural stability for electrode material, respectively. Also, the Ni doping and carbon coating are expected to raise electronic conductivity. Then, the electrochemical performance of LIBs utilizing LiMn0.995Ni0.005SiO4@C, LiMn0.985Ni0.015SiO4@C, and LiMn0.92Ni0.08SiO4@C (ZNi-02 to ZNi-04) as cathode materials are investigated and compared with that of the LiB using Li2MnSiO4@C (ZNi-01). The ZNi-04 sample-based LiB shows well D-Li(+) and a peak discharge capacity as high as 188.4 mAh g(-1). In addition, the ZNi-04 sample can still maintain a capacity of about 80 mAh g(-1) at rate of 8 C. Such excellent electrochemical performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of the dual-phase coexistence, the proper amount of Ni doping, and surface coating of carbon, which enhances the electrical conductivity and structural stability. Thus, Li2Mn1-xNixSiO4@C has broad application chances as a high-performance LIBs electrode material.

This study was conducted to investigate the impact of properties of the adsorbent and natural organic matter (NOM) in feed water on membrane fouling in an integrated adsorption-UF system. A continuous-flow hollow fiber UF set-up with periodic backwash and aeration was used to imitate the operation of full-scale integrated adsorption-UF systems. Two types of adsorbents, commercial powdered activated carbon (PAC) and homemade mesoporous adsorbent resin (MAR), were examined. As for Songhua River water dominated by allochthonous NOM, membrane fouling of the PAC/UF system was increased by 39.5% compared with that of UF alone, whereas the addition of MAR mitigated membrane fouling by 66.4%. For the synthetic water composed of algal organic matter (AOM), membrane fouling of PAC/UF and MAR/UF systems was reduced by 40.7% and 83.3%, respectively. The results suggested that deposition of adsorbent particles and fouling resistance of the cake layer were determined by the hydrophobicity and molecular weight distribution of NOM as well as the properties of adsorbents. This study highlights the significance of adsorbent selection for the integrated adsorption-UF process according to the source and properties of NOM.

Here, we show the production of large-area highly branched MoS2 dendrites on amorphous SiO2/Si substrates using an atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition and explore their use in electrocatalysis. By tailoring the substrate construction, the monolayer MoS2 evolves from triangular to dendritic morphology because of the change of growth conditions. The rough edges endow dendritic MoS2 with a fractal dimension down to 1.54. The highly crystalline basal plane and the edge of the dendrites are visualized at atomic resolution using an annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope. The monolayer dendrites exhibit strong photoluminescence, which is indicative of the direct band gap emission, which is preserved after being transferred. Post-transfer sulfur annealing restores the structural defects and decreases the n-type doping in MoS2 monolayers. The annealed MoS2 dendrites show good and highly durable HER performance on the glassy carbon with a large exchange current density of 32 mu A cm(geo)(-2), demonstrating its viability as an efficient HER catalyst.

A nanosilver-actuated high-performance porous silicon anode from recycling of silicon waste	MATERIALS TODAY NANO			English	Article						Silicon waste recovery; Diamond wire saw silicon powder; Porous silicon; Anode material; Lithium-ion batteries	LI-ION; BATTERY ANODES; VOLUME-CHANGE; SI ANODES; WIRE-SAW; LITHIUM; NANOPARTICLES; STORAGE; CARBON; ELIMINATION	The global need for improved fuels has promoted the development of the renewable photovoltaic industry. However, a significant amount of diamond wire saw silicon powder (DWSSP, similar to 300,000 t/a) is produced during the process of solar cell manufacturing. Thus, there is a significant need for strategies to recycle and use DWSSP for increased sustainability and protection of the environment. Here, nanoporous silicon (PSi) composites materials derived from silicon cutting waste were used to fabricate lithium-ion anodes with high capacity and stable cycling performance. DWSSP was chemically crushed using nanocopper-assisted etching. Next, porous PSi/Ag composites were prepared by nanosilver-assisted etching, using dopamine as a source of organic for surface coating. Carbon-coated PSi/Ag nanocomposites (PSi/Ag/C) exhibited excellent cycling performance with a retained discharge capacity of 1092.9 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 1000 mA/g, with a capacity retention rate of 80%. These results indicate that PSi/Ag/C from DWSSP can be used to prepare functional lithium-ion battery anodes. This work describes the high-value utilization of an abundant waste material produced in the solar industry and provides an effective strategy to produce porous materials for energy storage.

Higher concentrations of PM10, PM10-2.1, and PM2.1 (108.3 +/- 23.4 mu g m(-3), 47.3 +/- 10.6 mu g m(-3), and 61.0 +/- 18.8 mu g m(-3)) were measured at Gulou than those (88.1 +/- 21.1 mu g m(-3), 31.4 +/- 6.7 mu g m(-3), and 56.7 +/- 18.6 mu g m(-3)) at Zifeng. The most abundant chemical components for size-fractionated PM were SO42-, NO3-, organic carbon (OC), NH4+, elemental carbon (EC), and crustal elements such as Al, Ca, Fe, and Mg, varying significantly on different particulate sizes. The concentrations of OC and EC were 7.46-19.60 mu g m(-3) and 3.44-5.96 mu g m(-3) at Gulou and were 8.34-18.62 mu g m(-3) and 2.86-4.11 mu g m(-3) at Zifeng, showing an equal importance in both fine and coarse particles. Nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium were more concentrated in PM2.1, contributing 11.30-13.76 mu g m(-3), 8.91-9.40 mu g m(-3), and 5.78-6.81 mu g m(-3), which was more than in PM10-2.1, which contributed 2.73-5.06 mu g m(-3), 2.16-3.81 mu g m(-3), and 0.85-0.87 mu g m(-3). In contrast, the crustal elements were larger in coarse particles and at the ground level, accounting for 18.6% and 15.3% of the total PM at Gulou and Zifeng. Source apportionment using the chemical mass balance (CMB) model EPA showed that the dominant three sources were secondary nitrate (18.2-24.9%), secondary sulfate (14.5-20.4%), and secondary organic aerosols (15.5-19.6%) for PM10, PM2.1, and PM1.1 at both Gulou and Zifeng during the entire sampling period. However, for PM10-2.1, the largest three contributors were secondary organic aerosols (18.3%), the coal-fired power plant (15.6%), and fugitive dust (14.4%), indicating dusts including construction dust, fugitive dust, and soil dust would contribute more at the ground. The results also showed that the concentrations of PM10, PM2.1, and PM1.1 were lower than the work carried out in the winter of 2010 at the same sampling site by 41.4%, 26.3%, and 24.8%, confirming the improvement of the air quality and the efficient control of PM pollutants.

Weak d(0) magnetism in C and N doped ZnO	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							1ST PRINCIPLES; ZINC-OXIDE; FERROMAGNETISM; SEMICONDUCTORS; MOLECULES; FILMS	We present an ab initio study of carbon and nitrogen substituting oxygen in zinc oxide structure. Detailed spin-polarized total-energy calculations of the various defect and dopant at different charge states and geometries indicate a non-zero spin magnetic moment only found from the C-O(-2) while NO shows no sign of localized magnetic moment. It is also revealed that CO has a tendency towards forming C-2 complexes inside the ZnO structure with very weak antiferromagnetic spin arrangement. Furthermore, it was found that oxygen vacancy and hydrogen interstitial could not induce ferromagnetism in C doped ZnO. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Among them, sodium-based batteries offer a combination of attractive properties i.e., low cost, sustainable precursors and secure raw material supplies. Na-based batteries include related battery concepts, such as Na-ion, all solid-state Na batteries, Na/O-2 and Na/S, that differ in key components and in redox chemistry, and therefore result in separate challenges and metrics. Na-ion batteries represent an attractive solution which is almost ready to challenge Li-ion technology in certain applications; the other cell concepts represent a more disruptive innovation, with a higher performance gain, provided that major hurdles are overcome. The present review aims at highlighting the most promising materials in the field of Na-based batteries and challenges needed to be addressed to make this technology industrially appealing, by providing an in-depth analysis of performance metrics from recent literature. To this end, half-cell reported metrics have been extrapolated to full cell level for the more mature Na-ion technology to provide a fair comparison with existing technologies.

There are many reports about the visible absorption and Raman spectra of all-trans-beta-carotene with pressure. But the study about the Raman scattering cross section and the Huang-Rhys factor with pressure have not been reported now. Visible absorption and Raman spectra of all-trans-beta-carotene were measured in carbon disulfide in the pressure range from 0. 04 to 0. 60 GPa. The results indicated that the visible absorption spectra of beta-carotene in nonpolar solvent carbon disulfide are red-shifted with pressure increasing, but the frequency shifts towards higher frequencies in the Raman spectra, the Raman scattering cross section decreases, Huang-Rhys factor increases, and the electron-phonon coupling constants of CC bond vibration modes increase. The mechanism is that all-trans-beta-carotene caused by compression and a decrease in the structurally ordered properties of the molecules leads to narrow energy gap of the pi, shortens effective conjugation length, hinders delocalization of pi-electron, decreases the Raman scattering cross section, and increases the Huang-Rhys factor and the electron-phonon coupling constants.

Materials and methods Venous blood samples were collected from three healthy donors. C-12(6+) ions beam was used to irradiate the blood samples at the energy of 330 MeV and linear energy transfer (LET) of 50 keV/mu m with a dose rate of 1 Gy/min in the spread-out Bragg peak. The irradiated doses were 0 (sham irradiation), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 Gy. Dic + r chromosomes aberrations were scored in metaphases. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN) was conducted to analyze MN and NPB. The maximum low-dose relative biological effectiveness (RBEM) values of the induction of dic + r, MN and NPB in human lymphocytes for C-12(6+) ions irradiation was calculated relative to Co-60 gamma-rays. Results The frequencies of dic + r, MN and NPB showed significantly increases in a dose-depended manner after exposure to C-12(6+) ions. The distributions of dic + r and MN exhibited overdispersion, while the distribution of NPB agreed with Poisson distribution at all doses. Linear-quadratic equations were established based on the frequencies of dic + r and MN. The dose-response curves of NPB frequencies followed a linear model. The derived RBEM values for dic + r, MN and NPB in human lymphocytes irradiated with C-12(6+) ions were 8.07 +/- 2.73, 2.69 +/- 0.20 and 4.00 +/- 2.69 in comparison with Co-60 gamma-rays. Conclusion The dose-response curves of carbon ions-induced dic + r, MN and NPB were constructed. These results could be helpful to improve radiation risk assessment and dose estimation after exposed to carbon ions irradiation.

Identification of an RNA sponge that controls the RoxS riboregulator of central metabolism in Bacillus subtilis	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS REVEALS; IRON-SPARING RESPONSE; COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM; ACETYL-COENZYME; PROTEIN HFQ; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; BACTERIA; MEDIATE; NETWORK	sRNAs are a taxonomically-restricted but transcriptomically-abundant class of post-transcriptional regulators. While of major importance for adaption to the environment, we currently lack global-scale methodology enabling target identification, especially in species without known RNA hub proteins (e.g. Hfq). Using psoralen RNA cross-linking and Illumina-sequencing we identify RNA-RNA interacting pairs in vivo in Bacillus subtilis, resolving previously well-described interactants. Although sRNA-sRNA pairings are rare (compared with sRNA-mRNA), we identify a robust example involving the conserved sRNA RoxS and an unstudied sRNA RosA (Regulator of sRNAA). We show RosA to be the first confirmed RNA sponge described in a Gram-positive bacterium. RosA interacts with at least two sRNAs, RoxS and FsrA. The RosA/RoxS interaction not only affects the levels of RoxS but also its processing and regulatory activity. We also found that the transcription of RosA is repressed by CcpA, the key regulator of carbon-metabolism in B. subtilis. Since RoxS is already known to be transcriptionally controlled by malate via the transcriptional repressor Rex, its post-transcriptional regulation by CcpA via RosA places RoxS in a key position to control central metabolism in response to varying carbon sources.

Annual forest maps (1986-2016) of Guangdong, China were generated using time series Landsat images and PALSAR data. Initially, four PALSAR-based classifiers were used to classify land cover types. Then, the optimal mapping algorithm was determined. Next, an accurate identification of forest and non-forest was carried out by combining Landsat-based phenological variables and PALSAR-based land cover classifications. Finally, the spatio-temporal distribution of forest cover change due to afforestation was created and its forest biomass dynamics changes were detected. The results indicated that the overall accuracy of forest classification of the improved model based on the PALSAR-based stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) classification and the maximum value of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; SGB-NDVI) were approximately 75-85% in 2005, 2010, and 2016. Compared with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) PALSAR-forest/non-forest, the SGB-NDVI-based forest product showed great improvement, while the SGB-NDVI product was the same or slightly inferior to the Global Land Cover (GLC) and vegetation tracker change (VCT)-based land cover types, respectively. Although this combination of multiple sources contained some errors, the SGB-NDVI model effectively identified the distribution of forest cover changes by afforestation events. By integrating aboveground biomass dynamics (AGB) change with forest cover, the trend in afforestation area closely corresponded with the trend in forest AGB. This technique can provide an essential data baseline for carbon assessment in the planted forests of southern China.

X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the catalyst. The electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst was investigated by line-scan voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry using rotating disk electrode technique. The results indicated that the Co3O4/C has electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The exchange current density of Co3O4/C catalyst obtained by the Koutecky-Levich theory is 1.1 x 10(-9) A/cm(2). The overall electron transfer number for the ORR was determined to be similar to 2, suggesting that the ORR catalyzed by Co3O4/C is a 2- electron transfer pathway. The process of oxygen adsorption on the surface of Co3O4/C was simulated through Materials Studio to explore the catalytic mechanism. The state density, electron density, bond length, and adsorption energy of O and Co were calculated. Restricted by the geometric configuration, O-2 can only be adsorbed by the Pauling adsorption mode. After adsorption, the O 2p orbit and Co 3d orbit hybridize with each other and form a new chemical bond. The pi bond of O-2 is mainly weakened by the electron transfer from Co to O. At the same time, the other O atom is activated. H+ can easily bond with the other O and the catalytic reaction occurs through 2- electron transfer pathway.

The aim of this study is to determine the remediation efficiency of GWC on the Pb concentration in soil and uptake by pakchoi cabbage and to assess the activities of dehydrogenase, urease, and catalase after applying GWC. Original soil samples were spiked with Pb (NO3)(2) of 500 mg/kg, and greenhouse pot experiment was carried out. Three seedlings of pakchoi cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp) were planted in plastic pots with mixture of soil amended with three levels of GWC (2%, 5%, and 10%, w/w). Soil and plant samples were collected over 45-day growth, after which Pb concentration and enzyme activities were assessed by laboratory analysis. The available Pb in soil and total Pb in roots and leaves of pakchoi cabbage greatly decreased after adding GWC, associated with significant increases in organic matter, water soluble organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available K and P, whereas pH was not a main factor controlling Pb speciation in this study. Activities of dehydrogenase, urease, and catalase were promoted with addition of GWC because physical properties, high organic matter, and organic carbon content rose by 9-fold, 40%, and 37% at 10% application rate, respectively. In conclusion, GWC could be an alternative option for the remediation of Pb-contaminated soil because of soil quality improvement and Pb reduction in soils and plants, without introducing extra heavy metals compared with other organic amendments.

Cha-01, Chlamydomonas sp. Tai-03 and Coelastrum sp. Pte-15) were evaluated for their capacity to adsorb p-nitrophenols (PNP) using raw microalgal biomass and powdered activated carbon (PAC) as the control. The results show that BC-Cha-01 (biochar from Chlorella sp. Cha-01) exhibited a high PNP adsorption capacity of 204.8 mg g (1), which is 250% and 140% higher than that of its raw biomass and PAC, respectively. The adsorption kinetics and equilibrium are well described with pseudo-second-order equation and Freundlich model, respectively. BC-Cha-01 was found to contain higher polarity moieties with more O-containing functional groups than PAC and other microalgae-derived biochars. The strong polarity of binding sites on BC-Cha-01 may be responsible for its superior adsorption capacity. The biochars from Chlorella sp. Cha-01 seem to have the potential to serve as a highly efficient PNP adsorbent for wastewater treatment or emergency water pollution control. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, we propose an electrodissolution-coupled Hf(OR)(4) synthesis system using an alcohol solvent and Hf metal as feedstock for the efficient, low-carbon and waste-free electro-synthesis of Hf(OR)(4). The electrochemical behavior of the tetraethylammonium-hydrogen sulfate (Et4NHSO4)-based EHS process is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, Tafel, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, complemented with SEM observation. The anodic hafnium dissolution/corrosion occurs inside the passive film while the cathodic ethanol dehydrogenation occurs in a two-stage pathway. Tafel extrapolation and numerical fitting analysis acquires important kinetics parameters, such as corrosion current density, exchange current density, and apparent activation energy as well as solution, polarization and "Warburg" resistances, etc. This work can provide theoretical guidance for the efficient operation of EHS.

The zinc oxide nanofibers showed cauliflower-like, disordered, vertically and horizontally aligned morphologies in different temperature regions. The aligned nanofibers were composed of hexagonal zinc oxide with good crystallinity. Gallium was doped into zinc oxide with a concentration of 0.73 at. %. The growth process and the characteristics can be interpreted by a vapor-liquid-solid mechanism. The field emission of the vertically aligned zinc oxide fiber array showed a low field emission threshold, high current density, rapid surge, and high field enhancement factor. The threshold electric field is about 2.4 V/mum at a current density of 0.1 muA/cm(-2). The field enhancement factor was 2991. The emission current density and the electric field followed the Fowler-Nordheim relationship. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.

Firstly, a wire drawing process of low-carbon steel was simulated using the FEM, in which a texture-based plastic potential in strain rate space was employed to account for the plastic anisotropy associated with the initial texture of the material. The deformation history predicted by the FEM calculations was then fed to the polycrystal plasticity Taylor model to simulate the textures at different radial locations of the wire. The simulation results showed an ordinary <110>-fiber texture at the wire center and mixed {110}<110> and {112}<110> cyclic fiber textures at the subsurface of the wire, indicating obvious radial texture gradient. The simulated textures are in good agreement with the characteristics of the experimental results. A close relation between the formation of the cyclic textures and shear deformation was identified by comparison of the plastic deformation and the textures along the wire radius.

J	Li, SX; Cui, GR				Li, S. X.; Cui, G. R.			Dependence of strength, elongation, and toughness on grain size in metallic structural materials	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							DEFORMATION; DUCTILITY; STEEL; LAW	The dependence of yield strength, uniform elongation, and toughness on grain size in metallic structural materials was discussed. The toughness is defined as the product of yield strength and uniform elongation. The yield strength versus grain size can be well described by the Hall-Petch relation; however, the uniform elongation versus grain size is not well understood yet. A simple model involving the densities of geometrically necessary dislocations and statistically stored dislocations was proposed to estimate the uniform elongation versus grain size. Existing data for low carbon steels and aluminum indicate that, in the grain size less than 1 mu m, the materials usually exhibit high strength and low uniform elongation and, in the grain size greater than 10 mu m, the materials usually exhibit low strength and high elongation; in either case the toughness is low. However, in the grain size of several micrometers, the toughness is the highest. It is suggested that we should pay more attention to develop the metallic materials with grain size of several micrometers for structural applications. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.

The core is composed of a complex of the NC (nucleocapsid) protein and genomic RNA, surrounded by a shell of the CA (capsid) protein. A method was developed for assembling cones in vitro using pure recombinant HIV-1 CA-NC fusion proteins and RNA templates. These synthetic cores are capped at both ends and appear similar in size and morphology to authentic viral cores. It is proposed that both viral and synthetic cores are organized on conical hexagonal Lattices, which by Euler's theorem requires quantization of their cane angles. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that the cone angles of synthetic cores were indeed quantized into the five allowed angles. The viral core and most synthetic cones exhibited cone angles of approximately 19 degrees (the narrowest of the allowed angles). These observations suggest that the core of HIV is organized on the principles of a fullerene cone, in analogy to structures recently observed for elemental carbon.

The three types of carbon were characterized before and after adsorption of chromium ions, using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Boehm titration, and zero charge (pH(pzc)). Results showed that the adsorption efficiency of IC on trivalent chromium (Cr3+) was the strongest, ion exchange of Cr(3+)with metal cations present on IC being the main adsorption mechanism, accounting for 61% of the total adsorption capacity. Among the metal ions, K(+)accounted for about 51%. The REDOX between Cr(3+)and carboxyl accounted for 20% of the total adsorption capacity. Other adsorption mechanisms, such as chelation between Cr(3+)and carboxyl, and co-precipitation between Cr(3+)and carbonate, occupied a small proportion. OC showed the largest adsorption capacity to hexavalent chromium (Cr6+). The adsorption mechanism of OC to Cr(6+)was the result of combined actions, such as electrostatic attraction, and REDOX between Cr(6+)with the aromatic pi-conjugated system and reductive functional groups like hydroxyl. Among them, the REDOX accounted for 53% of the total adsorption of Cr(6+)by OC.

Nano-scale mechanical and wear properties of a corrosion protective coating reinforced by cellulose nanocrystals - Initiation of coating degradation	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Nanomechanical properties; Nanowear; Coating degradation; Scanning probe microscopy; Hydroxyacrylate; Cellulose nanocrystals	ORGANIC COATINGS; POLYMER-FILMS; DISPERSIONS; WATER	Organic coatings are commonly used for protection of substrate surfaces like metals and wood. In most cases they fulfil their purpose by acting as a barrier against unwanted substances such as oxygen, water or corrosive ions. However, with time coatings fail due to degradation caused by chemical reactions or wear by wind, water, impact of solid particles or sliding motions against other solid objects. In this work we focus on a nanocomposite anticorrosion coating consisting of a hydroxyacrylate-melamine matrix that has been reinforced by a small amount (0.5 wt%) of cellulose nanocrystals. This nanocomposite is of interest as it has shown favourable corrosion protection properties on carbon steel. Here we investigate the nanomechanical and nanowear properties of the coating in air and in water, and we also explore how these properties are affected by exposure to a corrosive 0.1 M NaCl solution. Our data show that the nanomechanical properties of the coating surface is strongly affected by the environment (air or water), and that exposure to the corrosive solution affects the coating surface well before any deterioration of the corrosion protective properties are found. We suggest that our experimental methodology constitutes a powerful way to investigate and understand the initiation of coating degradation.

The nitrogen (N) dynamics and crop growth were significantly affected when NT is alternative to conventional tillage (CT). However, the long-term effects of NT on N dynamics especially uptake and utilization and crop growth are not well understood. The aim of this study was to quantify the N cycle in the 0-100 cm soil profile, as well as the total N uptake and yield of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) when the soil management changed from CT to NT for years. To this end, a 7-year field experiment was conducted from 2010 to 2017 on a sandy loam soil in Henan Province, China. Soil organic carbon, soil water and inorganic nitrogen content, plant growth and yield collected in field experiment were used to calibrate and validate the root zone water quality model. The simulated results indicated that a 55.8% decrease in N leaching, 4.8% increase in soil available N and 3.4% increase in averaged root N uptake when the soil management switched from CT to NT. Additionally, the average grain yield, N use efficiency, N utilization efficiency and N harvest indices were all improved under NT. Therefore, replacing CT with NT appears to be beneficial in terms of reducing N pollution of groundwater, enhancing N availability and wheat production.

The synthesis of (+)-nootkatone by chemical oxidation from (+)-valencene cannot meet the increasing demand in natural aromatics markets. Development of a viable bioprocess using microorganisms is attractive. According to the yields of beta-nootkatol and (+)-nootkatone by strains harboring different expression cassettes in the resting cell assay, premnaspirodiene oxygenase from Hyoscyamus muticus (HPO), cytochrome P450 reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCPR) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were finally selected and overexpressed in CEN center dot PK2-1Ca, yielding beta-nootkatol and (+)-nootkatone with 170.5 and 45.6 mg L-1 ethyl acetate, respectively. A combinational engineering strategy including promoter change, regulator ROX1 knockout, squalene pathway inhibition, and tHMGR overexpression was performed to achieve de novo (+)-valencene production. Subsequent culture investigations found that galactose as the induced carbon source and a lower temperature (25 degrees C) were beneficial to target accumulation. Also, replacing the inducible promoters (GAL1) of HPO and AtCPR with constitutive promoters (HXT7 and CYC1) dramatically increased the beta-nootkatol accumulation from 108.2 to 327.8 mg L-1 ethyl acetate in resting-cell experiments using (+)-valencene as a substrate. Finally, the total terpenoid titer of the engineered strain of PK2-25 using glucose as a carbon source was improved to 157.8 mg L-1 cell culture, which was 56 times the initial value. We present a new candidate for production of (+)-valencene and its related sesquiterpenoids with attraction for industry.

The Ni/TiO2 catalyst bed gradually deactivated while the Ni/ZrO2 and Ni/Ta2O5 catalyst beds showed persistent and high carbon gasification efficiency for 80 h operation. Characterization results verified that property stabilization of the sol-gel Ni/ZrO(2 )and Ni/Ta2O5 catalysts occurred in the long-term SCWG flow, indicating a "catalyst in-situ activation" effect that enhanced the activity and coking resistance of the as-prepared sol-gel catalysts for continuous SCWG. Results also indicate that sintering of Ni with the supports to form new phases and metal leaching of the catalyst materials in the SCW flow may be key deactivation factors of the catalyst beds.

However, little is known about its potential use in reductive degradation of soil-sorbed contaminants. In this study, biochar (BC) supported S-nZVI (S-nZVI@BC) was successfully synthesized through sulfidation and carbon loading modification, which effectively combined the solubilization characteristics of BC and high reduction characteristics of SnZVI. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis suggested that sulfur and iron were evenly distributed throughout BC matrix. The degradation of nitrobenzene (NB) in soil was achieved more efficiently with the as-synthesized S-nZVI@BC composites. Results indicated that S-nZVI@BC with SnZVI/BC mass ratio of 3:1, dosage of 10 mg/g exhibited superior NB removal (98%) and aniline (AN) formation (90%) efficiency within 24 h without formation of other intermediates, higher than those of S-nZVI. Meanwhile, the surface FeSX layer enhanced the antioxidant capacity of S-nZVI@BC and participated in the reduction of NB. The soil-sorbed NB decreased from 14% to 1.4%, indicating that the addition of BC played an important role in solubilization of NB from soil. Solubilization-reduction was the dominant mechanism for NB removal. This research indicated that S-nZVI@BC held the potential to enhance in-situ remediation of NB-contaminated soil.

Here we report a new design of lithium-sulphur battery using electrically connected graphite and lithium metal as a hybrid anode to control undesirable surface reactions on lithium. Lithiated graphite placed in front of the lithium metal functions as an artificial, self-regulated solid electrolyte interface layer to actively control the electrochemical reactions and minimize the deleterious side reactions, leading to significant performance improvements. Lithium-sulphur cells incorporating this hybrid anodes deliver capacities of >800 mAhg(-1) for 400 cycles at a high rate of 1,737mAg(-1), with only 11% capacity fade and a Coulombic efficiency >99%. This simple hybrid concept may also provide scientific strategies for protecting metal anodes in other energy-storage devices.

Methods: Nineteen adults, American society of anesthesiology class (ASA) 1-2 patients with body mass index <30 kg.m(-2) underwent microlaryngoscopic surgery using HFNC for airway management. Outcomes included apnoea time, intraoperative oxygenation, carbon dioxide value, lactate value, and the relationship between the duration of apnoea time and carbon dioxide levels. Results: A total of 19 patients underwent vocal cord tumor resection under a microlaryngoscope with HFNC as the sole method of ventilation. The mean age was 39.7 years old, and the mean BMI was 23.9 kg.m(-2). The mean apnea time was 21.5 min. The SpO(2) of 18 patients remained above 90%, and only 1 patient dropped to 88%. The average basal lactate and highest lactate value was 0.58 mmol. L-1 and 0.68 mmol.L-1. The difference between basal and highest lactate values was statistically significant (P< 0.05). The average highest PaCO2 value was 79.4 mmHg. The PaCO2 increased by 1.68 +/- 0.12 mmHg every minute linearly. Conclusions: In the case series we have observed that HFNC would be safe and effective oxygenation and ventilation technique for selected Chinese patients undergoing non-laser microlaryngoscopic surgery within 30 min. The tubeless technology reduces the complications of tracheal intubation and jet ventilation and clears the surgical field of vision.

Grain size, dinoflagellate cysts, diatoms, and bulk carbon stable isotopes and C/N ratios of the Hainan Delta clearly support four stages of the delta development. Those stages, along the core profile of ca. 74.50-27.0 m below seafloor (mbsf), were reconciled with the deltaic facies; their depth ranges and dates are as follows: 74.50-56.80 mbsf (ca. 65.07-62.01 kyr. BP), 56.80-42.10 mbsf (ca. 62.01-58.61 kyr. BP), 42.10-30.95 mbsf (ca. 58.61-57.02 kyr. BP), and 30.95-27.00 mbsf (ca. 57.02-55.60 kyr. BP). Core ZBW is composed mainly of fine to medium sand, with admixture of coarse sand and shell debris throughout the deltaic facies. The C/N ratio in the sediment indicates mixed terrigenous and marine origin of the organic matter. The bulk carbon isotope record clearly indicates domination of terrigenous sources. The dinoflagellate cyst ('dinocyst') assemblages provided information on in-situ produced marine organic matter delivered to the deltaic sediments. The abundant presence of dinocysts indicates a high nutrient supply and favorable trophic conditions of the waters the donor species dwelled in. A constant supply of organic matter from terrigenous sources and its rapid mineralization is interpreter as factors conducive to a higher abundance of dinocysts. The low abundance of fossil diatoms is attributed to high dilution and the lateral transport of strongly silicified coastal diatoms down the Continental slope.

J	Hu, YX; Li, S				Hu, Yixuan; Li, Song			Fabrication of a-Fe2O3/Ag film by spin coating with enhanced photoelectrochemical activity	MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article						Solar energy materials; Interfaces; Thin films; Iron oxide; Heterojunction	HEMATITE	Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation represents one of the biggest scientific challenges in producing solar fuels. As a promising photoanode candidate, hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) suffers from limited separation of photo-generated charges. In this work, a simple spin coating method is reported to obtain alpha-Fe2O3/Ag films on FTO glass substrates with accurately controlled thickness and composition. The alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode with appropriate amount of Ag exhibited superior photoelectrochemical performance with a photocurrent density of 1.33 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V, which is 1.77 times higher than that of the pure alpha-Fe2O3. By calculating the bulk separation efficiency and surface separation efficiency, the significantly enhanced PEC performance is ascribed to the interfacial effect on separating the photogenerated charges in hematite. The method described herein provides a simple and general method for engineering the interface of metal/oxide interface.

In the present work, the longitudinal dynamic behaviors of some common one-dimensional nanostructures (e.g. nanorods/nanotubes) were examined using the hardening nonlocal approach. The hardening nonlocal longitudinal stress was employed and an eigenvalue analysis method was utilized in deriving some dynamic characteristics of the minute structures at nanoscale. The effects of a dimensionless nonlocal small scale parameter at molecular level unavailable in classical rods/tubes were investigated. Subsequently, nonlocal longitudinal vibration responses under various boundary conditions including soft and hard constraints were determined through a numerical method. The correlations between natural frequencies and the nonlocal nanoscale parameter were obtained and discussed in detail. Within the framework of hardening nonlocal stress theory, it concludes for the first time that the longitudinal free vibration frequencies of nanorods/nanotubes are higher than those based on the classical continuum mechanics but they are quite different from the softening nonlocal model. The strengthening effects on nonlocal stiffness of nanorods/nanotubes are observed and they are consistent with some other theoretical approaches or atomistic simulations. In particular, a case study on nonlocal natural frequencies of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was presented and the results were calculated by atomistic simulations, classical continuum theory, softening and hardening nonlocal models, respectively. The validity of both existing softening and hardening nonlocal models was confirmed in comparison with the atomistic simulations. In addition, a comparative calculation for dimensional natural frequencies with respect to length of CNTs by different methodologies was provided to explain why the softening and hardening nonlocal models are both correct in nonlocal elasticity theory.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM investigations indicated that two types of nanostructures were formed: nanocrystalline strain-induced martensite (body-centered cubic structure) with a mean grain size of 74 nm and nanocrystalline austenite (face-centered cubic structure) with a size of 31 nm characterized by dense deformation twins. The results about the formation of fully nanocrystalline grain structures in stainless steel suggested that a low stacking fault energy is exceptionally profitable for producing nanocrystalline materials by equal channel angular pressing.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of neonatal exposure to sevoflurane on neurobehavioral profiles in adolescent rats, and applied an integrated approach of lipidomics and proteomics to investigate the molecular network implicated in neurobehavioral dysfunction. We found that neonatal exposure to sevoflurane caused cognitive impairment and social behavior deficits in adolescent rats. Lipidomics analyses revealed that sevoflurane significantly remodeled hippocampal lipid metabolism, including lysophatidylcholine (LPC) metabolism, phospholipid carbon chain length and carbon chain saturation. Through a combined proteomics analysis, we found that neonatal exposure to sevoflurane significantly downregulated the expression of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1), a key enzyme in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism, in the hippocampus of adolescent rats. Importantly, hippocampal LPCAT1 overexpression restored the dysregulated glycerophospholipid (GP) metabolism and alleviated the learning and memory deficits caused by sevoflurane. Collectively, our evidence that neonatal exposure to sevoflurane downregulates LPCAT1 expression and dysregulates GP metabolism in the hippocampus, which may contribute to the neurobehavioral dysfunction in the adolescent rats.

Herein, we demonstrate the remarkable ammonia capture capabilities of the hierarchically porous MOF-808 xerogel (G808) macrostructure and its amino-functionalized analogue (G808-NH2), which were constructed through a sol-gel-based strategy combined with convenient ambient pressure drying. Static isotherm measurements and dynamic breakthrough tests using engineered ZrMOF xerogel granules were conducted to illuminate the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics for ammonia sorption. The G808 and G808-NH2 xerogels manifest substantially higher ammonia uptake, intensified interfacial interactions, and enhanced irreversible retention toward ammonia compared with the state-of-the-art activated carbon-based materials, particularly at the low-concentration region. Moreover, these hierarchical ZrMOF nanoarchitectures exhibit extraordinary ammonia removal performance as well as excellent environmental robustness under simulated respirator canister/protection filter circumstances, with the breakthrough capacities of G808-NH2 being individually more than two and one orders of magnitude greater than those for the pristine and metal-amine impregnated carbons. The kinetic ammonia adsorption behaviors can be well delineated by the pseudo-first-order Wheeler-Jonas model. An in-depth discussion on the ammonia sorption regime, detailing five binding patterns besides reversible physisorption with a special focus on the impacts of polar amino groups and humidity, was proposed based on multiple characterizations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation.

A simple experimental platform was built to verify the excellent adsorption, stability, selectivity and repeatability of the composite. Then, the mechanism of adsorption enhancement was analyzed by heterojunction. Aiming at 170 sets of gas sensing data sets, Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) was used to extract data features, and grey wolf optimization vector machine regression (GWO-SVR) model was established to predict carbon monoxide concentration. The correlation coefficient (R-P), root mean square error (RMSEP) and calculation time of prediction set were 99.3025%, 0.0418 and 1.47 s, respectively. Therefore, the combination of the superior properties of a composite sensitive material and the small sample quantitative prediction model is a promising method for gas sensors in the future.

Herein, by using a simple metal-organic framework (MOF) based strategy, a Ni/NiAl2O4-M catalyst with an enhanced Ni-support interaction is successfully fabricated. The catalyst exhibits an enhanced low-temperature catalytic performance in CO methanation. CO conversion and CH4 selectivity as high as 99.8% and 58.0%, respectively, are achieved on the Ni/NiAl2O4-M catalyst at 350 degrees C. The strong Ni-support interaction on the Ni/NiAl2O4-M catalyst results in more active H atoms, and promotes the formation of active CH* species which are the key intermediates for CO methanation. This not only enhances the conversion of CO into CH4, but also suppresses the carbon deposition which has a negative effect on the catalytic reactions, thus improving the catalytic performance of Ni/NiAl2O4-M. Besides, the strong Ni-support interaction makes Ni/NiAl2O4-M highly resistant to sintering of the Ni nanoparticles during the catalytic reactions. The findings of the present work are helpful for fabricating catalysts with enhanced metal-support interaction for more efficient catalysis.

Numerical model is developed for top-blown oxygen converter off-gas formation, the off-gas formation is simulated using the developed model, and the influences of the operating model of converter on the characteristics of off-gas (concentrations, temperature, flowrate and sensible heat flux) are investigated. The simulated results indicate that CO concentration varies gently, CO concentration can reach about 80% during 10-80% blowing oxygen time, the change trend of CO2 concentration is contrary to that of CO concentration during 0-90% blowing oxygen time, and the dramatic changes of oxygen lance height result in significant fluctuations of off-gas flowrate. The operation model of oxygen-blowing pressure significantly affects off-gas sensible heat flux, and the sensible heat flux is high during 40-80% blowing oxygen time.

J	Leurent, F; Li, S				Leurent, Fabien; Li, Sheng			Between Pricing and Investment, What Mobility Policies Would Be Advantageous for Ile-de-France?	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								This article provides a prospective study of mobility policies for the private car and public transit (PT) modes of transportation in the Paris Ile-de-France region. Different economic instruments are considered: pricing of car traffic or transit service, subsidizing PT, and investment in PT to improve service quality. Policy scenarios are defined and assessed according to multiple criteria: users' benefits, PT production costs and fare revenues, public subsidies, and environmental damage both local (air pollution) and global (carbon emissions). The social, economic, and environmental impacts are monetized and aggregated in a wellbeing function. While a first set of scenarios are specified directly, two other sets of scenarios are calculated by optimizing the wellbeing function with respect to action variables on the transit mode in the medium or long run. The regional mobility system is modeled in a structural way: concentric subregions, travel demand segmented by geographical and behavioral conditions, environmental impacts based on road and rail traffic, and car mode and transit mode depicted each as a set of technical components involving 1 to 3 structural factors that can make action levers. This model-based methodology allows for trading between different kinds of impacts and identifying performance-oriented policy packages.

However, it is unclear how pit characteristics influence water transport and carbon economy in tropical species. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate functional implications of changes in pit characteristics for water relations and photosynthetic traits in tropical Ficus species with different growth forms (i.e. hemiepiphytic and non-hemiepiphytic) grown under common conditions. Intervessel pit characteristics were measured using scanning electron microscopy in five hemiepiphytic and five non-hemiepiphytic Ficus species to determine whether these traits were related to hydraulics, leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and wood density. Ficus species varied greatly in intervessel pit structure, hydraulic conductivity and leaf physiology, and clear differences were observed between the two growth forms. The area and diameter of pit aperture were negatively correlated with sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity, mass-based net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance (g(s)), intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) and the petiole vessel lumen diameters (D-v), but positively correlated with wood density. Pit morphology was only negatively correlated with sapwood- and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity and D-v. Pit density was positively correlated with g(s), C-i and D-v, but negatively with intrinsic leaf water-use efficiency. Pit and pit aperture shape were not significantly correlated with any of the physiological traits. These findings indicate a significant role of pit characteristics in xylem water transport, carbon assimilation and ecophysiological adaptation of Ficus species in tropical rain forests.

To identify the effects of nitrogen deposition on soil nutrient and ecological stoichiometry of the QTP's alpine grasslands, we treated three major types of grasslands (alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and cultivated grassland) with 6 different nitrogen addition levels: 0, 8, 24, 40, 56, 72 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1) through the years of 2015 to 2016. We sampled the soils at two depths, 0-10 and 10-20 cm in the peak-growing season (July) of each year. Results showed that: (i) soil total carbon and phosphorus are relatively stable under nitrogen deposition. (ii) Soil total nitrogen increases under low nitrogen addition rates while decreases under higher rates, and soil available nitrogen increases under nitrogen deposition in surface soil while decreasing in deeper soil. (iii) C:N, C:P, N:P had no significant difference between different nitrogen addition levels while there were significant differences between the two years under nitrogen addition.

The complex was revealed as a dinuclear structure by single crystal X-ray diffraction, where two Ag(I) ions are bridged by two cis-dbe molecules via their four N atoms of cyano groups. The benzene, employed as crystallized solvent in synthesis, was revealed to coordinate with metal The ligand presents as cis configuration and the two thiophene rings adopt anti-parallel conformation with reactive C distance of 3.46 angstrom, which is short enough for the photo-cyclization. These structural features are favorable for the ring-closure reaction. On the other hand, BF2-1 is existed as counter anion sandwiched between the neighboring dinuclear complexes via extensive intramolecular hydrogen bonds and Van de Waals contacts. Also, strong pi-pi interactions exist in the complex. These weak interactions are theoretically disadvantageous to the photo-cyclization. As expected, the cis-trans photo-isomerization was successfully suppressed by involving of cis-dbe into coordination bonds and rational selecting of 405 nm excitation light as evidenced by IJV-Vis spectra and 1H NMR studies. And the reversible ring-closing and ring-opening reactions with color inter-conversion between yellow and red were not prohibited in solution, solid state and PMMA films, suggesting an indistinctive effect of metal coordination on ring closure.

Our study focused on the variation of functional traits between epiphytic and terrestrial individuals of Selliguea griffithiana, and provided considerable functional acclimation of this species to such contrasting environments. We sampled ramets of S. griffithiana from epiphytic and terrestrial habitats of a subtropical montane moist forest, SW China. Morphological and anatomical traits, photosynthesis, biomass and ramet density of S. griffithiana were measured and it was found that these traits differed significantly between the two habitats. Frond length, stipe length, spacer length (interramet distance), stomatal density, vein density, maximal chlorophyll fluorescence and relative chlorophyll content of fronds, and biomass per ramet were all lower in epiphytic habitat than those in terrestrial habitat, whereas frond thickness and ramet density were higher in the former. Photosynthetic light-response curves revealed a higher carbon assimilation capability of individuals in terrestrial habitat than in epiphytic habitat, whereas cumulative water loss curves showed a lower water loss rate in the latter. The findings demonstrate acclimation of S. griffithiana to both habitats, that is, epiphytic ramets can mitigate water scarcity at some cost of a reduced photosynthetic capacity, whereas terrestrial ramets can afford to improve the light capture to a higher photosynthetic capacity without any water stresses.

Bimetallic PGM-free M1M2-NC catalysts and their active sites, however, have been poorly studied to date. The present study explores the active accessible sites of mono- and bimetallic Fe-NC and FeNi-NC catalysts. Combining CO cryo chemisorption, X-ray absorption and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy, we evaluate the number and chemical state of metal sites at the surface of the catalysts along with an estimate of their dispersion and utilization. Fe L-3,L-2-edge X-ray adsorption spectra, Mossbauer spectra and CO desorption all suggested an essentially identical nature of Fe sites in both monometallic Fe-NC and bimetallic FeNi-NC; however, Ni blocks the formation of active sites during the pyrolysis and thus causes a sharp reduction in the accessible metal site density, while with only a minor direct participation as a catalytic site in the final catalyst. We also use the site density utilization factor, phi(SDsurface/bulk), as a measure of the metal site dispersion in PGM-free ORR catalysts. phi(SDsurface/bulk) enables a quantitative evaluation and comparison of distinct catalyst synthesis routes in terms of their ratio of accessible metal sites. It gives guidance for further optimization of the accessible site density of M-NC catalysts.

It was found the decolorization efficiency and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of ST reached above 98% and 95%, respectively, within 18 min at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. And the organic pollutants were totally mineralized to simple inorganic species such as HCO3-, Cl- and NO3-, while the total organic carbon (TOC) decreased 99.3%. The structure and morphology of the catalyst after ten cycling runs showed that the catalyst was stable under such operating condition and the leaching test showed negligible leaching effect. This ZnO/MoO3 nanotube is proved to be an active and stable heterogeneous catalyst in CWAO of ST under extremely mild conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The effects of C concentrations and milling processing parameters on powder particle morphology were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Result show that at the early stage of milling, lamellae-like microstructure is formed. With the increase of milling time, particle size decreases. The crystallite size after 100 h of milling is found to be 47 nm. Moreover, high levels of carbon and micro-alloyed elements dissolve in the iron powders during milling by diffusion and solid-state reaction. When prolonging the milling time, the powders evolve into small irregularly shaped particles. The effects of compaction pressure and C concentrations on the density of green samples were analyzed.

Particular attention was paid on the effects of pH and the co-solvent methanol on the degradation intermediates of EE2. Twelve intermediates were identified, and several intermediates reported herein have not been found in previous studies. The degradation efficiency of EE2 and the number of identified intermediates decreased evidently at pH 3 and in the presence of methanol at pH 7. Three photocatalytic degradation pathways were proposed: The transformation of the phenolic moiety (pathway I) is the primary initial reaction pathway; the initial photocatalytic degradation in the aliphatic carbon linked to the aromatic ring (pathway II) only took place at pH 7; the isomerization of EE2 (pathway III) could occur only in the presence of methanol at pH 7. Results from this study underscore the importance of photocatalytic degradation on the removal of estrogenic activity mainly expressed by the phenol moiety of EE2. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, S; Jiao, CJ				Li, Song; Jiao, Chu-Jie			Behavior of CFRP-confined reactive powder concrete-filled steel tubes under axial compression	ADVANCES IN STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						axial compression; bearing capacity; CFRP-confined reactive powder concrete-filled steel tubes; confinement; ultimate load	STRESS-STRAIN MODEL; STUB COLUMNS; STRENGTH; EXPOSURE	Reactive powder concrete-filled steel tubes (RPCFSTs) have become an important research target in recent years. In engineering applications, RPCFSTs can provide superior vertical components for high-rise and tower buildings, thereby enabling developers to provide more floor space. However, this type of composite structure is prone to inelastic outward local buckling. The use of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) wrapping to suppress such local buckling has shown great potential in limited test results. This paper presents experimental results concerning the axial compression of CFRP-confined reactive powder concrete-filled circular steel tubes (CF-RPCFSTs). We included 18 specimens in our experimental investigation, varying the number of CFRP layers, steel tube thickness, and RPC strength. According to our test results, CF-RPCFSTs exhibit compression shear failure and drum-shaped failure. The CFRP wrap can effectively enhance bearing capacity and postpone local buckling of the steel tube. In addition, three-layer CFRP-confined RPC-filled thin-wall steel tubes are suitable for engineering. We also propose a model to calculate the bearing capacity of CF-RPCFSTs. Compared to the existing model of CFRP-confined concrete-filled steel tubes, the results obtained using the proposed model are in good agreement with our experimental results.

Fly ash (FA), sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate, and water were used as raw materials for geopolymerization. The geopolymerization characteristics and granulation efficiency were analyzed. The physical, mechanical, and durability properties of the AA were evaluated. The enhancement mechanism of plastic coating on AA was discussed. The mechanical and thermal properties of the concretes were assessed. Results showed that the geopolymerization is not a crystallization process, and the granulated AA would deteriorate during the soak-dry cycles. Furthermore, coating AA with plastic could enhance the AA and protect it from water damage, and plastic with different strengths and ductility would have different strengthening modes. Lastly, the plastic-coated AA concrete showed a better performance than AA concrete and better thermal insulation than ordinary concrete. And the cost and benefit analysis indicated that plastic-coated AA was a promising building material in the future for carbon neutrality.

Here, we use a carbonized wood (C-wood) as a 3D, highly porous (73% porosity) conductive framework with well-aligned channels as Li host material. We discovered that molten Li metal can infuse into the straight channels of C-wood to form a Li/C-wood electrode after surface treatment. The C-wood channels function as excellent guides in which the Li stripping/plating process can take place and effectively confine the volume change that occurs. Moreover, the local current density can be minimized due to the 3D C-wood framework. Therefore, in symmetric cells, the as-prepared Li/C-wood electrode presents a lower over-potential (90 mV at 3 mA.cm(-2)), more-stable stripping/plating profiles, and better cycling performance (similar to 150 h at 3 mA.cm(-2)) compared with bare Li metal electrode. Our findings may open up a solution for fabricating stable Li metal anode, which further facilitates future application of high-energy-density Li metal batteries.

The structure of the product 6b, with L = PHPh2, has been established by X-ray diffraction. Crystals are monoclinic, of space group P2(1)/n, with a = 9.52C (2) angstrom, b = 19.870 (4) angstrom, c = 20.849 (4) angstrom, and V = 3843 (1) angstrom3 for Z = 4. The tungsten is ligated by two CO and two PHPH2 groups with a transoid-W(CO)2(PHPh2)2 arrangement. The metal atom is also eta-5-coordinated by the open pentagonal CCBBB face of the nido-icosahedral C2B9 fragment. The cage system has an exo-polyhedral CH2C6H4CH2-2 bridge linking two boron vertices. One methylene group is attached to the boron in the beta-site with respect to the two carbons in the pentagonal face, while the other methylene group is bonded to a boron in the B5 ring above the CCBBB site. Treatment of Id with HBF4.Et2O in the presence of PPh3 affords closo-1,2-Me2-8-(CH2C6H4CH2OMe-2)-3,3,3-(CO)3-3-(PPh3)-3,1,2-WC2B9H8 (7a). In contrast, Ph2PCH2PPh2 yields closo-1,2-Me2-8,9-(CH2C6H4CH2-2)-3,3-(CO)2-3,3-(Ph2PCH2PPh2)-3,1,2-WC2B9H7 (8). A compound structurally similar to the latter is obtained if PhC=CPh is the substrate molecule present during protonation. Addition of aqueous HI to CH2Cl2 solutions of 1d gives [NEt4][closo-1,8-Me2-10,11-(CH2C6H4CH2-2)-2-I-2,2,2-(CO)3-2,1,8-WC2B9H7] (11), the structure of which has been established by X-ray diffraction. The salt forms triclinic crystals, space group Pi, with two structurally similar but crystallographically independent ion pairs in the asymmetric unit: a = 8.784 (2) angstrom, b = 12.639 (3) angstrom, c = 28.712 (7) angstrom, V = 3150 (1) angstrom3 for Z = 4. In the carborane fragment the icosahedral core has a 2,1,8-WC2B9 configuration, and there is no connectivity between the two carbon vertices. The tungsten is coordinated by three CO groups and by an iodide ligand. It is also eta-5-coordinated by a CB4 pentagonal face of the cage. The latter has an exo-polyhedral bridging CH2C6H4CH2-2 group, the methylene fragments of which link boron atoms in the two CB4 pentagonal layers; these borons occupy the same cage vertices as in 6b. Treatment of the iodo compound with TlBF4 in the presence of Bu(t)C=CH gives a mixture of the mono- and bis(alkyne) complexes closo-1,8-Me2-10,11-(CH2C6H4CH2-2)-2-(eta-Bu(t)C2H)-2,2-(CO)2-2,1,8-WC2B9H7 (12) and closo-1,8-Me2-10,11-(CH2C6H4CH2-2)-2,2-(eta-Bu(t)C2H)2-2-(CO)-2,1,8-WC2B9H7 (13). The NMR data (H-1, C-13{H-1}, B-11{H-1}, and P-31{H-1} for the new compounds are reported and discussed in relation to the structures.

However, their dynamic changes at the same time in brain are still not clear, mainly due to a lack of a single biosensor capable of simultaneous quantification of two species in a live rat brain. In this work, a selective and sensitive ratiometric electrochemical biosensor was developed for simultaneously quantifying glucose and pH using both current and potential outputs in a rat brain of diabetic model. Here, glucose oxidase was first employed as a specific recognition element for both glucose and pH because the active center (FAD) could undergo a 2H+/2e+ process. Moreover, an insensitive molecule toward pH and glucose was used as an inner reference element to provide a built-in correction to improve the accuracy. The ratio between the oxidation peak current density of glucose and that of ABTS gradually increased with increasing concentration of glucose, and showed a good linearity in the range of 0.3-8.2 mM. Meanwhile, the midpotential difference between glucose oxidase and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) positively shifted with pH decreasing, leading to accurate determination of pH in the linear range of 5.67-7.65. Thus, combined with the unique properties of carbon fiber microelectrode, including easy to insert and good biocompatibility, the developed single biosensor was successfully applied to detect pH and glucose at the same time in hippocampus, striatum, and cortex in a live rat brain of diabetic model.

Alocasia macrorrhiza (L.) Schott is an herbaceous species that can develop very large leaves of up to 1 m in length. However, little is known about the hydraulic and photosynthetic design of such giant leaves. Based on previous studies of smaller leaves, and on the greater surface area for trait variation in large leaves, we hypothesized that A. macrorrhiza leaves would exhibit significant heterogeneity in structure and function. We found evidence of reduced hydraulic supply and demand in the outer leaf regions; leaf mass per area, chlorophyll concentration, and guard cell length decreased, as did stomatal conductance, net photosynthetic rate and quantum efficiency of photosystem II. This heterogeneity in physiology was opposite to that expected from a thinner boundary layer at the leaf edge, which would have led to greater rates of gas exchange. Leaf temperature was 8.8 degrees C higher in the outer than in the central region in the afternoon, consistent with reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration caused by a hydraulic limitation to the outer lamina. The reduced stomatal conductance in the outer regions would explain the observed homogeneous distribution of leaf water potential across the leaf surface. These findings indicate substantial heterogeneity in gas exchange across the leaf surface in large leaves, greater than that reported for smaller-leafed species, though the observed structural differences across the lamina were within the range reported for smaller-leafed species. Future work will determine whether the challenge of transporting water to the outer regions can limit leaf size for plants experiencing drought, and whether the heterogeneity of function across the leaf surface represents a particular disadvantage for large simple leaves that might explain their global rarity, even in resource-rich environments.

A 3D porous copper (Cu) current collector as a host for Li deposition can effectively settle these problems. However, constructing a uniform and compact 3D porous Cu structure is still an enormous challenge. Herein, an electrochemical etching method for Cu-Zinc (Zn) alloy is reported to precisely engrave a 3D Cu structure with uniform, smooth, and compact porous network. Such a continuous structure endows 3D Cu excellent mechanical properties and high electrical conductivity. The uniform and smooth pores with a large internal surface area ensures well dispersed current density for homogeneous Li metal deposition and accommodation. A smooth and stable solid electrolyte interphase is formed and meanwhile Li dendrites and dead Li are effectively suppressed. The Li metal anode conceived 3D Cu current collector can stably cycle for 400 h under an Li plating/stripping capacity of 1 mA h cm(-2) and a current density of 1 mA cm(-2). The Li@3D Cu||LiFePO4 full cells present excellent cycling and rate performances. The electrochemical dealloying is a robust method to construct 3D Cu current collectors for dendrite-free Li metal anodes.

The friction properties of LDHs and the calcined products were tested and the rubbed areas were analyzed by scanning electron microscope, energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) and auger electron spectrometer (AES). The results showed that the diameter of LDHs was about 100-175 nm and the formula was Mg0.69Al0.31(OH)(2)(CO3)(0.15)center dot 0.16H(2)O. All the calcined products had the laminated structure. The anti-wear properties of 1000 degrees C calcined products were superior to the LDHs, which was attributed to the supporting and mechanical polishing effects of the hard spinels. The distribution laws of elements of worn area in the horizontal and vertical direction were concluded. The tribological performance of calcined products can be attributed to the "multi-layer self-lubrication mechanisms". The tribofilms consisted of "carbon-enriched layer", "oxygen-enriched layer" and "transition layer" and combined strongly with the metal substrate.

No cage, no tube: Relative Stabilities of nanostructures	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							BISMUTH NANOWIRE ARRAYS; TEMPERATURE; TRANSITION; MOLECULES; EXCHANGE; SURFACES	Relative stabilities of nanostructures are important in the design and selection of components for nanodevices. Here, we use first-principles simulations to evaluate the relative stabilities of representative nanostructures of semimetal Bi, semiconductive C, and metallic Au. The Bi-n cages are metastable and highly active and can readily transform to more stable three-dimensional amorphous structures upon activation. Both finite bismuth nanotubes and infinite nanotubes are even less stable than the cage structures. This is contrary to the cases for carbon, boron, and gold. The differences lie in their bonding characteristics and their responses to curvature. Our findings show tendencies of evolution of different types of nanostructures and also indicate that if a nanocage is (not) stable, then its nanotube is even more (less) stable. Hence, the stability of a cage structure predetermines the existence of a nanotube for a given element: i.e., no cage, no tube.	[Li, S. F.; Guo, Z.

The changes in the C 1s, S 2p, 0 1s and Al 2p core-level spectra, with the progressive deposition of aluminium, were carefully monitored. Alurninium was found to interact extensively with the bulk-adsorbed oxygen to form a layer of metal oxide and Al-O-C complex at the Al/PFT interface. Migration of the bulk-adsorbed oxygen to the surface occurred in response to the deposition of aluminium onto the polymer. The changes in the C 1s and S 2p lineshape suggested the formation of aluminium carbide and sulfide species, promoted by the electron transfer from the deposited aluminium atoms to the conjugated carbon and sulfur atoms of PFT. The deposited aluminium atoms did not diffuse to a significant extent into the sub-surface region of the polymer film, but aggregated in the form of island-like clusters before forming a metallic layer.

Thus, high-throughput computational screening (HTCS) strategy based on grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation is proposed to quickly explore the top-performing MOFs with high adsorption capability towards formaldehyde. In this work, the computation-ready experimental (CoRE)-MOF database consisting of 2932 MOF structures carrying density derived electrostatic and chemical (DDEC) charges obtained from density function (DFT) theory calculations, were employed in high-throughput GCMC simulations for formaldehyde adsorption from the air. The structure-property relationship from HTCS revealed that the MOF candidates with high formaldehyde uptakes exhibited small pore sizes, relatively high selectivity and moderate heat of adsorption (Q(st)). Afterwards, the top MOFs with both high uptake and selectivity towards formaldehyde were chosen for further experimental evaluation. Three selected MOFs Y-BTC, ZnCar and Ni-BIC were successfully synthesized and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and BET surface area analysis. In order to validate our HTCS strategy, the representative Cu-BTC and activated carbon (AC) were also adopted as controls. The formaldehyde adsorption test was performed in a sealed container with the formaldehyde concentration of 100 mg/m(3) at 298 K. After 24 h adsorption, the formaldehyde uptakes of the adsorbents were obtained according to the concentration changes prior to and after formaldehyde exposure by UV-vis spectrometer. It was found that the adsorption capacities of Y-BTC, ZnCar and Ni-BIC were 0.38, 0.25 and 0.11 mol/kg, respectively, which were remarkably higher than Cu-BTC (0.08 mol/kg) and AC (0.06 mol/kg). The recyclability of the best performer Y-BTC was also verified. These findings open up the possibility of employing HTCS strategy for highly efficient exploration of MOF adsorbents for formaldehyde removal.

J	Li, S				Li, Sen			Modeling of pressure effects on flame structure and soot formation of n-heptane/air co-flow laminar flames by skeletal reaction mechanism	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Flame structure; Soot formation; Pressure; n-heptane; Skeletal mechanism	DIFFUSION FLAMES; FIELD; ATM	The conversion from chemical energy to thermal energy by the high-pressure combustion of hydrocarbon fuel/air is often accompanied by pollution emissions of PAHs and soot in aircraft gas turbines and diesel engines, and the measurement and analysis of PAHs and soot formations in the practical turbulent flame of engines are difficult. In the study, based on the simulation of the simple laminar co-flow diffusion flame of n-heptane/air by the developed skeletal reaction mechanism, the effects of pressure on flame structure and soot formation are investigated. The results indicate that flame height keeps constant at 0.7 similar to 3.0 MPa; the flame radius decreases with pressure as p(-1/2); the maximum carbon conversion to soot (eta(s,max)) is proportional to pressure at 0.1 similar to 2.0 MPa; the maximum soot volume concentration (f(v,max)) increases with pressure as p(2); the locations of f(v,max) and eta(s,max) along flame centerline are inconsistent, and f(v,max) and eta(s,max) occur respectively at the middle and lower parts of flame height; f(v,max) occurs in the region where the mixture fraction and temperature are respectively 0.08 similar to 0.09 and about 1200 K. The diffusion flame consists of three zones: fuel heating zone, fuel-rich reaction zone and oxidizer-rich reaction zone. eta-C7H16 is firstly decomposed into small molecule gas (e.g., H-2, CH4, C2H2,C2H4, C2H6, C3H4, C3H6, etc.) in the heating zone, and PAHs (C6H6, C8H8 and C10H8) and soot precursors (C2H2, C6H5, C6H6 and C2H4) are formed in fuel-rich reaction zone.

Response of labile organic C and N pools to plastic film removal from semiarid farmland soil	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Plastic film mulching; plastic film removal; labile soil organic matter; C management index; spring maize	CARBON MANAGEMENT INDEX; EXTRACTION METHOD; RIDGE-FURROW; NITROGEN; MATTER; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; COMPONENTS; FRACTIONS; OXIDATION	To examine the effects of plastic film removal on grain yield and soil organic matter (SOM), a spring maize (Zea may L.) field experiment was conducted for 5 yr at Changwu Agricultural and Ecological Experimental Station of Northwest China. Compared with traditional plastic film mulching during entire growing stages (FM), plastic film removal at the silking stage (RM) resulted in a 6.3% higher average maize yield. Under the RM treatment, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen significantly increased after the 5-yr cultivation in the 0- to 20-cm layer. Significant increases in extractable organic C (EOC), KMnO4-oxidizable C (KMnO4-C) and C management index (CMI) in the 0- to 20-cm layer, and light fraction organic C and EOC in the 20- to 40-cm layer were observed in response to plastic film removal after the 1-yr treatment; the responses were more significant after 5 yr. Under the RM treatment, significant increases in microbial biomass C, light fraction organic N, extractable organic N, KMnO4-C and CMI were also observed after five years in the 20- to 40-cm layer. Moreover, KMnO4-C and EOC were much more sensitive than other labile SOM fractions to the application of RM, even after only 1 yr of cultivation. Therefore, compared with mulching for the whole growing season, plastic film removal at the maize silking stage is an effective option for increasing yields and enhancing SOM concentration and soil sustainability in the regions with semiarid monsoon climates that have sufficient rainfall during maize reproductive stages.
